THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL IMIDAZO [1, 3, 5] TRIAZINONES"<br>
BAYER AKTffiNGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, ofD-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: <br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel imidazo [1, 3, 5] triazinones.<br>
The present invention relates to novel imidazo[l,3,5]triazinones, to processes for preparing them and to their use as medicaments, in particular as inhibitors of cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases.<br>
The synthesis of imidazo[l,3,5]triazinones is described in J. Org. Chem. (1979), 44(10), 1740-2; in J. Org. Chem. (1979), 44(22), 3835-9; in J. Org. Chem. (1981), 46 (18), 3681-5 and J. Chem. Res. Synop. (1994), (3), 96-7. These publications did not report any biological effect.<br>
Imidazo[l,3,5]triazinones which possess antiviral and/or antitumor effect are described in Nucleosides Nucleotides (1987), 6(4), 663-78; in Eur. J. Med. Chem. (1992), 27(3), 259-66; in J. Heterocycl. Chem. (1993), 30(5), 1341-9; in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38(18), 3558-68 and Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (1996), 6(2), 185-8. The compounds which are mentioned in these literature references were for the most part prepared as guanine or guanosine analogs and are therefore as a rule substituted in the 2 position by -NH2, -SH or -H. None of the compounds which are described contains a phenyl ring or a substituted phenyl ring in the 2 position. None of the compounds which are described has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterases.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are potent inhibitors of cyclic guanosine<br>
3",5"-monophophate-metabolizing phosphodiesterases (cGMP - PDEs). In accordance<br>
with the nomenclature of Beavo and Reifsnyder (Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 150-<br>
155, 1990), these phosphodiesterases are the phosphodiesterase isoenzymes PDE-L<br>
PDE-nad PDE-V.	<br>
An increase in the concentration of cGMP can lead to therapeutic, antiaggregatory, antithrombotic, antiproliferative, antivasospastic, vasodilatory, natriuretic and diuretic effects. It can exert an effect on the short-term or long-term modulation of vascular and cardiac inotropy, cardiac rhythm and stimulus conduction in the heart (J. C. Stoclet,<br>
2<br><br>
T. Keravis, N. Komas and C. Kugnier, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs (1995), 4 (11), 1081-1100). Inhibition of the cGMP-PDEs can also strengthen erection. These compounds are therefore suitable for treating erectile dysfunction.<br>

15<br><br>
In addition, a process was found for preparing the compounds according to the invention of the general formula (I), in which process compounds of the general formula (II)<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
19	3<br>
R , R and R have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
are first of all converted, by reaction with chlorosulfonic acid (CISO3H), where appropriate in inert solvents, where appropriate in the presence of a base, into the compounds of the general formula (m)<br><br>
S02CI<br>
in which<br>
R1, R2 and R3 have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
and, in a last step, are reacted with amines of the general formula (TV)<br>
HN-R4R5        (IV),<br>
                  16<br><br>
in which<br>
R4 and R have the abovementioned meaning.<br>
The process according to the invention can be explained, by way of example, by the following formula scheme:<br><br><br><br>
Solvents which are suitable for the individual steps are the customary organic solvents which are not altered under the reaction conditions. These solvents preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or glycol dimethyl ether, or<br>
17<br><br>
hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or petroleum fractions, or halogenohydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents.<br>
In general, the reaction temperatures can vary over a relatively wide range. In general, the temperatures employed are in a range of from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably of from 0Â°C to 70Â°C.<br>
In general, the process steps according to the invention are carried out under standard pressure. However, it is also possible to carry them out under positive pressure or under negative pressure (e.g. in a range from 0.5 to 5 bar).<br>
The reactions can, for example, take place in a temperature range of from 0Â°C to room temperature and under standard pressure.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IT) are novel and can be prepared by reacting compounds of the general formula (V)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 has the abovementioned meaning,<br>
in the NaOC2H5 / C2H5OH system, with compounds of the general formula (VI)<br>
18<br><br>
R2-halogen     (VI),<br><br>
in which<br>
R2       has the abovementioned meaning, to give the compounds of the general formula (VII)<br><br>
CN       O<br><br>
in which<br>
R and R have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
and subsequently, likewise in the NaO2H5 / C2H5OH system, carrying out a reaction with compounds of the general formula (VTn)<br><br>
in which<br>
R3 has the abovementioned meaning,<br>
to give the compounds of the general formula (DC)<br>
19<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2 and R3 have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
and finally cyclizing in inert solvents, in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSC1).<br>
Solvents which are suitable for the individual steps are the customary organic solvents which are not altered under the reaction conditions. These solvents preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofiiran or glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or petroleum fractions, or halogenohydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents.<br>
In general, the reaction temperatures can vary within a relatively wide range. In general, the temperatures employed are in a range from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably of from 0Â°C to 70Â°C.<br>
The process steps according to the invention are generally carried out under standard pressure. However it is also possible to carry them out under positive pressure or under negative pressure (e.g. in a range from 0.5 to 5 bar).<br>
20<br><br>
The reactions can, for example, take place in a temperature range of from 0Â°C to room temperature and under standard pressure.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IH) are novel and can be prepared as described above.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (TV), (V), (VI), (VH) and (VET) are either known per se or can be prepared using customary methods.<br>
Some of the compounds of the general formula (IX) are novel and can be prepared using customary methods.<br>
The compounds according to the invention of the general formula (I) exhibit a valuable pharmacological spectrum of activity which it was not possible to foresee.<br>
They inhibit either one or several of the c-GMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases (PDE I, PDE II and PDE V). This leads to an increase in c-GMP. The differing expression of the phosphodiesterases in different cells, tissues and organs, as well as the differing subcellular location of these enzymes, make it possible, in combination with the selective inhibitors according to the invention, to address the different cGMP-regulated processes selectively.<br>
In addition, the compounds according to the invention augment the effect of substances such as EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) and ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide), of nitro vasodilators and all other substances which increase the concentration of the cGMP in another way than phosphodiesterase inhibitors.<br>
The compounds according to the invention of the general formula (I) are therefore suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases in which an increase in the concentration of cGMP is therapeutic, i.e. diseases which are connected with cGMP-regulated processes (in English, usually simply termed cGMP-related diseases). These<br>
22<br><br>
diseases include cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the urogenital system and cerebrovascular diseases.<br>
Within the meaning of the present invention, the term "cardiovascular diseases" covers diseases such as high blood pressure, neuronal hypertension, stable and unstable angina, peripheral and cardiac vascular diseases, arrhythmias, thromboembolic diseases and ischemias such as myocardial infarction, stroke, transistory and ischemic attacks, angina pectoris and peripheral circulatory disturbances, and also prevention of restenoses following thrombolysis therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) and bypass.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds according to the invention of the general formula (T) can also have importance for cerebrovascular diseases. These include, for example, cerebral ischemia, stroke, reperfusion damage, brain trauma, edemas, cerebral thromboses, dementia and Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
The relaxing effect on smooth musculature makes them suitable for treating disorders of the urogenital system such as prostate hypertrophy and incontinence and also, in particular, for treating erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
Activity of the phosphodiesterases (PDEs)<br>
The cGMP-stimulatable PDEII, the cGMP-inhibitable PDE III and the cAMP-specific PDEIV were isolated either from porcine heart myocardium or from bovine heart myocardium. The Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulatable PDE I was isolated from porcine aorta, porcine brain or, preferably, from bovine aorta. The c-GMP-specific PDEV was obtained from porcine small intestine, porcine aorta, human blood platelets and, preferably, from bovine aorta. Purification was effected by means of anion exchange chromatography on Pharmacia MonoQR, essentially in accordance with the method described by M. Hoey and Miles D. Houslay, Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 40, 193-202 (1990) and C. Lugman et al. Biochemical Pharmacology Vol. 35 1743-1751 (1986).<br><br>
The enzyme activity is determined in a 100 ul test mixture, in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 7.5, which contains 5 mM MgCk, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml and either 800 Bq of 3HcAMP or 3HcGMP. The final concentration of the corresponding nucleotides is 10"6 mol/1. The reaction is started by adding the enzyme, with the quantity of enzyme being measured such that approx. 50% of the substrate is transformed during the incubation time of 30min. In order to test the cGMP-stimulatable PDEH, 3HcAMP is used as the substrate and lO-6mol of unlabeled cGMP/1 is added to the mixture. In order to test the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent PDE I, 1 uM CaCh and 0,1 uM calmodulin are additionally added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is stopped by adding 100 ul of acetonitrile which contains 1 mM cAMP and 1 mM AMP. 100 ul of the reaction mixture are separated by HPLC and the cleavage products are determined quantitatively online using a flow-through scintillation counter. The substance concentration at which the reaction rate is decreased by 50% is measured. The "phosphodiesterase [ H] cAMP-SPA enzyme assay" and the "phosphodiesterase [3H] cGMP-SPA enzyme assay", supplied by Amersham Life Science, were additionally used for testing. The test was carried out using the experimental protocol specified by the manufacturer. The [3H] cAMP-SPA assay was used for determining the activity of PDEH, with l0-6M cGMP being added to the reaction mixture for the purpose of activating the enzyme. 10" M calmodulin and 1 pM CaCl2 were added to the reaction mixture for the purpose of measuring PDE I. PDE V was measured using the [ H] cGMP-SPA assay.<br>
In principle, the inhibition of one or more phosphodiesterases of this type leads to an increase in the concentration of cGMP. As a result, the compounds are of interest for all therapies in which an increase in the concentration of cGMP can be assumed to be therapeutic.<br>
The investigation of the cardiovascular effects was carried out on normotensive rats and on SH rats and on dogs. The substances were administered intravenously or orally.<br>
23<br><br>
The examination for erection-inducing effects was carried out on conscious rabbits [H. Naganuma, T. Egashira, J. Fuji, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology 20, 177-183 (1993)]. The substances were administered orally or parenterally.<br>
The novel active compounds, and also their physiologically harmless salts (e.g. hydrochlorides, maleates or lactates) can be converted, in a known manner, into the customary formulations, such as tablets, coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable carrier substances or solvents. In this connection, the therapeutically effective compound should in each case be present at a concentration of from about 0.5 to 90% by weight of the total mixture, i.e. in quantities which are sufficient for achieving the specified dosage range.<br>
The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds with solvents and/or carrier substances, where appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, with it being possible, for example when using water as a diluent, to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents, where appropriate.<br>
The administration is effected in a customary manner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, for example perlingually, by the buccal route, intravenously, nasally, rectally or by inhalation.<br>
For use in humans, doses of from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 mg/kg -20mg/kg, are generally administered when administering orally. A dose of 0.001 mg/kg - 0.5 mg/kg is expedient when administering parenterally, for example by way of mucosae, nasally, by the buccal route or by inhalation.<br>
Despite this, it can be necessary, where appropriate, to depart from the abovementioned quantities, specifically in dependence on the body weight or the nature of the route of administration, on the individual response to the medicament, on the nature of its<br><br>
formulation and on the time or interval at which the administration takes place. Thus, it can in some cases be sufficient to make do with less than the abovementioned smallest quantity whereas, in other cases, the abovementioned upper limit has to be exceeded. When relatively large quantities are being administered, it may be advisable to divide up these quantities into several individual doses which are given during the course of the day.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in veterinary medicine. For uses in veterinary medicine, the compounds, or their nontoxic salts, can be administered in a suitable formulation, in accordance with common veterinary procedures. The veterinarian can establish the nature of the application, and the dose, in accordance with the nature of the animal to be treated.<br><br><br>

The sulfonamides which are listed in the following tables 1 and 2 were prepared by means of automated parallel synthesis from the sulfonyl chlorides example VI (table 1) and example X (table 2), respectively, and the corresponding amines using one of the three following standard protocols.<br>
The purity of the end products was determined by means of HPLC while they were characterized by means of LC-MS measurement. The numerical value specified in the % (HPLC) column indicates the content of the end product which is characterized<br><br><br>
42<br><br>
by the molar peak. Standard protocol A was used in the case of amines possessing acid functionalies, standard protocol B in the case of amines possessing neutral functionalities, and standard protocol C in the case of amines possessing additional basic functionalities.<br>
In the case of compounds which are listed in the following tables 1 and 2 and which optically exhibit a free nitrogen valency, this latter is to be understood, in principle, as being an -NH radical,<br>
Standard protocol A: Conversion of amines possessing acid functionalities 0.05 mmol of amine, 0.042 mmol of sulfonyl chloride and 0.10 mmol of Na2CO3 are introduced initially, and 0.5 ml of a mixture consisting of THF/H2O is pipetted in by hand. After 24 h at RT, 0.5 ml of a 1 M H2SO4 solution is added and the mixture is filtered through a two-phase cartridge (500 mg of Extrelut (upper phase) and 500 mg of SiO2, mobile phase ethyl acetate). The product is obtained after concentrating the filtrate in vacuo.<br>
Standard protocol B: Conversion of amines possessing neutral functionalities 0.125 mmol of amine is introduced initially and 0.03 mmol of sulfonyl chloride, as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane, is pipetted in by the synthesizer. After 24 h, 0.5 ml of 1 M H2SO4 is added to the mixture and the latter is filtered through a two-phase cartridge (500 mg of Extrelut (upper phase) and 500 mg of SiO2, mobile phase: ethyl acetate). The filtrate is concentrated in vacuo.<br>
Standard protocol C: Conversion of amines possessing basic functionalities 0.05 mmol of amine is introduced initially and 0.038 mmol of sulfonyl chloride, as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane, and 0.05 mmol of triethylamine, as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane, are pipetted in by the synthesizer. After 24 h, 3 ml of saturated NaHCO3 solution are added initially and the reaction mixture is then filtered through a two-phase cartridge. The product is obtained after the filtrate has been concentrated in vacuo.<br><br>
                                                               43<br><br>
All the reactions are monitored by thin layer chromatography. If the reaction has not<br>
been completed after 24 hours at RT, the mixture is then heated at 60Â°C for a further<br>
12 hours and the experiment is subsequently terminated.	<br>
