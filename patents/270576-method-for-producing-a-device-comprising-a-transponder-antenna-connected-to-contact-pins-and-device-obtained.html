				<td>Method for producing a device comprising a transponder<br>
antenna connected to contact pads and device obtained<br>
The invention more particularly relates to the<br>
field of radio frequency transponders. In particular,<br>
it relates to a method for producing a device including<br>
a transponder antenna connected to contact pads and the<br>
device obtained.<br>
The above method more particularly includes a<br>
step of connecting the antenna to contact pads, the<br>
latter being possibly connected to a microcircuit such<br>
as an electronic chip or a module.<br>
The invention aims at being used mainly in the<br>
process of the production of a low cost and low<br>
thickness radio frequency electronic inlay preferably<br>
having good communication properties, more particularly<br>
as regards the range.<br>
Such an inlay includes at least an antenna on a<br>
substrate connected to a microcircuit; it is more<br>
particularly intended to be inserted into a sheet<br>
lamination, the cover of an electronic passport, an<br>
identification card or any product provided with the<br>
radio frequency communication section; and thus the<br>
thickness thereof is very important.<br>
Among various connection techniques, the most<br>
currently used is known which consists of a wire<br>
bonding type connection, a wire soldering using an<br>
ultrasonic probe which feeds and solders a connection<br>
wire between the various points to be connected, the<br>
chip or a component being positioned close to the ends<br>
of the antenna to be connected.<br>
This technique has the drawback of requiring flat<br>
connection metallic surfaces, more particularly<br>
engraved, and a support of surfaces resisting the<br>
pressure of a soldering tool, a protection resin on the<br>
connections, so as to protect the same and a sheet for<br>
compensating the thickness of the resin.<br>
In another solution, the connection is provided<br>
by a conductive adhesive material positioned between<br>
the ends of the antenna and the connections of a<br>
component, a module or a chip being placed directly on<br>
the connection ends of an antenna, for example made of<br>
copper and engraved on a substrate.<br>
The utilisation of a conductive adhesive material<br>
has the drawback of requiring metallic tracks or<br>
windings which are stripped and the intersection of the<br>
windings requires double face etchings or a step of<br>
production of an isolating bridge.<br>
A method of production of an antenna connected by<br>
a sewing stitch is known from the application for a<br>
patent JP 2002 298110 A, wherein a module is first<br>
fixed on a substrate and the antenna is subsequently-<br>
fixed by sewing stitches on the substrate; and as for<br>
the connection of the modules to the antenna, the wire<br>
extends above the pads and clamps by contact the<br>
contact pads on the module.<br>
As an alternative, the connection can be provided<br>
by a thermo-com.pression of the antenna wire on the<br>
contact pads, with the probe pressing and bringing<br>
thermal energy directly onto the wire.<br>
In other cases, such as in patent EP 0880 754 Bl,<br>
the antenna wire made of a wire inlaid into a polymer<br>
sheet, lies above the contact pads of a chip which is<br>
already positioned or the corresponding position<br>
thereof, prior to a connection by, more particularly,<br>
an ultrasonic or a thermo-compression soldering<br>
directly by pressing and bringing energy directly onto<br>
the wire.<br>
When it is necessary to go beyond connection pads<br>
positions, the substrate is provided with a cavity for<br>
receiving an electronic chip or a module. During the<br>
production, the inlaying tool stops the inlaying before<br>
the cavity, goes beyond the cavity and fixes the wire<br>
again after the cavity; then, the chip or a module is<br>
introduced from under the cavity so that the pads of<br>
the chip are facing the wires prior to making the<br>
connection by soldering.<br>
This method has the drawback of being time-<br>
consuming and requiring a cavity prior to the<br>
production of the antenna.<br>
Thus, as regards the presence of the module on<br>
the substrate prior to the production of the antenna,<br>
it can be an obstacle to the mass production rate of<br>
the antenna for some antenna embodiments.<br>
In the patent EP 1328899 Bl, the antenna is<br>
produced using a metallic wire sewn onto a sheet and<br>
contact dies are previously positioned on the sheet and<br>
sewn with the antenna wire, A chip is placed on the<br>
substrate and more particularly connected by a link<br>
with a "wire bonding" soldered to the dies. This<br>
technique requires the prior positioning of the pellets<br>
and subsequent coating of the connections as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The invention aims at solving the above-mentioned<br>
drawbacks of the connection of a microcircuit to an<br>
antenna, more particularly within the scope of the<br>
production of a low thickness and low cost radio<br>
frequency electronic inlay and ensuring having correct<br>
properties of communication, more particularly as<br>
regards the range.<br>
For this purpose, the invention aims at a method<br>
for producing a device including a transponder antenna<br>
connected to contact pads, said method including the<br>
following steps:<br>
- production of an antenna comprising connection<br>
terminal sections resting on a substrate,<br>
- placing contact pads on the substrate and the<br>
connection thereof to the antenna terminal sections,<br>
with the connection being carried out as a soldering by<br>
introduction of energy between the pads and the<br>
terminal sections;<br>
The method is characterised in that the pads are<br>
placed in such a way as to have a surface facing an<br>
antenna connection terminal section, said section being<br>
positioned on the substrate, the soldering energy being<br>
directly applied to the pads.<br>
In addition to solving the above-mentioned<br>
drawbacks, the invention gives flexibility to the<br>
production of the device, thanks to the separation of<br>
the production of the antenna from the other<br>
conventional inlay production operations, more<br>
particularly the previous positioning of the contact<br>
pads on a substrate, the prior production of a cavity<br>
under the antenna connection sections, the coating of<br>
the connections and preventing the soldering tool from<br>
being polluted.<br>
According to various characteristics of the<br>
implementation, the method is characterised:<br>
- in that the antenna is produced by embroidery<br>
or sewing on a flexible support including a fabric and<br>
in that it includes a step during which a reinforcing<br>
material is positioned more particularly as a sheet or<br>
a layer on a face of the substrate opposite the one<br>
carrying the terminal sections;<br>
- the reinforcing layer or sheet is positioned<br>
after the production of the antenna;<br>
- the method includes a step of forming a cavity<br>
in the substrate and/or the reinforcing sheet or layer<br>
close to the antenna connection terminal sections;<br>
- the method includes a step during which contact<br>
pads associated with a microcircuit are positioned<br>
facing the' antenna terminal sections, the microcircuit<br>
being inserted at least partly into the cavity;<br>
- the method includes a step according to which a<br>
soldering of the thermo-compression or ultrasonic type<br>
is carried out;<br>
- the soldering uses an anvil which rests against<br>
the recess of the antenna terminal section in the<br>
support;<br>
- the anvil goes through at least the reinforcing<br>
sheet or layer facing the connection terminal section<br>
so that the connection section is supported by the<br>
anvil during the soldering;<br>
- the antenna wire is a hybrid wire associated at<br>
least with a non conductive wire;<br>
Another object of the invention is a device<br>
including an antenna connected to contact pads, said<br>
device including a substrate and an antenna provided<br>
with connection terminal sections resting on the<br>
substrate, with said antenna being connected by<br>
soldering to the terminal sections.<br>
The device is characterised in that the electric<br>
contact pads have a surface facing an antenna<br>
connection terminal section with said section being<br>
positioned onto the substrate.<br>
According to other characteristics of the device:<br>
- the antenna is produced by embroidery or sewing<br>
on a flexible support including a fabric and it<br>
includes a reinforcing material as a sheet or a layer<br>
on one face of the substrate opposite the one<br>
supporting the terminal sections;<br>
- the device includes a cavity in the substrate<br>
and/or reinforcing sheet or layer close to the antenna<br>
connection terminal sections;<br>
- contact pads are associated with a microcircuit<br>
and positioned opposite the substrate and the antenna<br>
terminal sections resting on the substrate, whereas the<br>
microcircuit is inserted at least partially into the<br>
cavity;<br>
- the pads include a soldering mark across the<br>
pads on one face of the pads opposite the soldered one;<br>
the device includes perforations in the<br>
reinforcing material opposite each connected terminal<br>
section;<br>
- the antenna wire is a hybrid wire associated<br>
with at least one non conductive wire.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a<br>
radio frequency communication product such as a<br>
contactless chip card, a passport including the<br>
mentioned device or obtained according to the above-<br>
mentioned method.<br>

invention will appear while reading the following<br>

- Figure 14 illustrates the steps of the method<br>
according to the preferred embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic view of a device<br>
1 including an antenna 3 connected to contact pads 5, 6<br>
which can be obtained according to one embodiment of<br>
the method of the invention.<br>
The device includes a substrate 2 and an antenna<br>
provided with connection terminal sections 7, 8 resting<br>
on the substrate. The antenna is connected to the<br>
terminal sections by soldering (S). The antenna is<br>
produced by electrochemical etching. The tracks are<br>
thin with respect to the pads, for example 2mm in<br>
width/5mm. The module may include or not a support<br>
dielectric film.<br>
Preferably, the metallic contact surfaces 11 on<br>
which a soldering tool T (thermode) has been applied<br>
(Fig. 2) have no material which could pollute the<br>
soldering tool.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention in<br>
Figure 2, contrary to the prior art wherein connection<br>
sections lie above already positioned pads or are<br>
placed above a chip or a module recess, here the<br>
electric contact pads have a surface opposite an<br>
antenna connection terminal section which rests on the<br>
substrate 2. The pads rest on and in contact with the<br>
ends 7, 8 of the antenna during a connection operation<br>
with a device 1 resting on a plane P.<br>
Mainly in the prior art, the chip connections<br>
with etched antennas are produced with conductive or<br>
non conductive glue, but with pads on the chip, the<br>
latter being placed on the antenna, or through soldered<br>
wires, with the chip being positioned above the same.<br>
In Figure 3, with the same configuration for<br>
placing the pads or the module as in Figure 2, the<br>
antenna is produced by inlaying the conductive wire<br>
into a polymer sheet 2b. The conductive wire may be<br>
coated with a varnish or an isolating sheath 13.<br>
In Figure 4, still with the same placing<br>
configuration, the antenna is produced by embroidery or<br>
sewing on a flexible support including a fabric 2f.<br>
The support is flexible insofar as if has no behaviour<br>
or rigidity as all low thickness fabrics. The loose<br>
meshing (m) between warp and weft wires is, for<br>
example, between 200]jm and 300iam in both directions,<br>
with a SOpm thick or 48 dtex polyamide wire. In<br>
addition, the fabric 2f is not stable as regards its<br>
dimensions insofar as it can normally be stretched<br>
manually and more particularly in diagonal, for example<br>
by at least 3% to 20%. This extension is lower than 1%<br>
in the substrate warp or weft feeding direction with a<br>
feeding tension during the production.<br>
The handling of the supporting fabric of an<br>
embroidered antenna is very delicate (flexible and<br>
porous woven material), and so it is provided to<br>
stabilise it with a reinforcing material 15 in the form<br>
a sheet or a layer positioned on one face of the<br>
substrate opposite the one carrying the antenna<br>
terminal sections. The stabilising material 15 is<br>
fixed by adding a porous plastic sheet such as the one<br>
known under the trademark Teslin or synthetic paper.<br>
Preferably, the addition of the reinforcing sheet<br>
is carried out after the production of the antenna so<br>
as not to be an obstacle' for the production rates of<br>
embroidered antennas, but it could be carried out<br>
beforehand possibly with less interesting rates and a<br>
risk of deterioration of the needles on the embroidery<br>
or sewing frame.<br>
An effect sim.ilar to the addition of a sheet can<br>
be obtained by impregnating or coating a layer or<br>
spraying a product such as a coating, a primer, a<br>
resin, polymer foam, a gum able to stabilise the<br>
substrate as regards its dimension.<br>
The assembly can be carried out by lamination,<br>
thermo-soldering (melting of materials) or addition of<br>
an adhesive (as a film or a liquid), with the substrate<br>
being very low in thickness for productivity and easy<br>
implementation.<br>
This step also makes it possible to give a higher<br>
thickness to the substrate to enable the reception of<br>
at least a part of a component into the support during<br>
the placing of the latter.<br>
The device includes perforations 17, which may<br>
partially be closed, in the reinforcing material<br>
opposite each connection and terminal section 7b, 8b<br>
connected as results from the utilisation of a very low<br>
thickness anvil or needle applied under the conductive<br>
wire to be connected and which perforates the material<br>
as subsequently explained.<br>
In Figure 5, a single pad 16, not yet connected<br>
to the microcircuit, is placed on an embroidered wire<br>
antenna terminal section 18 with an embroidery wire 19<br>
for fixing the antenna on the fibrous support 2f. The<br>
connection of a microcircuit 20 to the pad can be<br>
carried out subsequently by any known means and more<br>
particularly using a flip-chip.<br>
In Figure 6, a fifth embodiment of the device<br>
includes a connection with a hybrid antenna wire 22<br>
insofar as the antenna wire 3 is associated with four<br>
non conductive wires 24; the association may however be<br>
made with at least one non conductive wire 24. The non<br>
conductive wires 24 are preferably thermo-fusible or<br>
thermo-plastic, so that they melt under the effect of a<br>
thermal or ultrasonic energy.<br>
Because of the presence of the non conductive<br>
wires 19 and 24 according to the invention, the tool<br>
(thermode) (T) is applied onto the metallic pad 16,<br>
which results in melting the fixing wire and/or<br>
associated wire going thereunder without polluting the<br>
soldering tool. Preferably, an anvil is supporting the<br>
antenna wire during the connection.<br>
In Figures 8 and 9, the device includes a cavity<br>
26 provided in the substrate and/or reinforcing sheet<br>
or layer close the antenna connection terminal<br>
sections. The contact pads 5, 6 are associated with a<br>
coated microcircuit 28. The microcircuit is inserted<br>
at least partially into the cavity thus reducing the<br>
total thickness of the device.<br>
As can be seen, the pads 5, 6 include a mark 30<br>
made by the soldering tool T and the soldering 38<br>
carried out through the pads 5, 6 on one face 11 of the<br>
pads opposite the one 32 soldered to the wire.<br>
Figure 10 shows another configuration of the<br>
antenna wires 7a, 7b with respect to the contact pads<br>
5, 6. The ends come face to face towards the chip.<br>
The application of the connection tool T is made<br>
transversally to the wire and to the pads and thus two<br>
corresponding marks 30 result on the top of the pads<br>
(free face 11) . The marks are parallel to each other<br>
and parallel to a line L separating the pads 5 and 6.<br>
In Figures 11 and 12, another configuration of<br>
the device is such that the antenna wire 8b is<br>
positioned in line with the pad but on the face of the<br>
support 15 or even 2f (if the fabric can be handled)<br>
opposite the one supporting the contact pad 16. In<br>
this case, the very low thickness anvil E pushes the<br>
antenna wire against the contact pad through the<br>
support while fluxing the material 15 on the support<br>
and/or pushing away the meshes of the fibrous support<br>
2f associated or not with a reinforcing material 15.<br>
In Figure 13, a fabric includes warp and weft<br>
wires with a loose meshing (m) between 200]im and 300]im<br>
and composed of 48 dtex polyamide wires.<br>
While referring to Figure 14, a preferred<br>
embodiment of the method of the invention will now be<br>
described which meets the aims of the invention, but<br>
while describing, first, the difficulties met.<br>
To produce low cost inlays, the inventors more<br>
particularly selected wiring antennas for example sewn.<br>
embroidered or equivalents on the support including<br>
fabrics.<br>
More particularly, in embroidery, because of<br>
problems of productivity and easy implementation,<br>
several antennas are first produced at the same time on<br>
embroidery frames, preferably on a textile support such<br>
as a fibrous support like a fabric, woven, non woven or<br>
a support which can be accepted by embroidery or sewing<br>
machines.<br>
However, any material capable of being sewn or<br>
embroidered and for example including other isolating<br>
substrates such as a film or a sheet made of polymer<br>
material, PVC, PET (polyethylene), paper, polyimide,<br>
synthetic leather and more particularly fibrous/fabric<br>
and polymer sheet composites, are not excluded.<br>
As regards the discretion of the device,<br>
subsequently laminated or added to an object, but also<br>
because of productivity and ease of sewing or<br>
embroidery, the support is a very fine fabric. The<br>
substrate of the final device may have various<br>
thicknesses generally lower than or equal to those of a<br>
0.76mm chip card, so that they can be used as an inlay<br>
between two films or sheets or be used as a support for<br>
a coating and/or a printing sheet. Typically, the<br>
substrate may have a thickness from for example 0.1mm<br>
to 0.5mm.<br>
The inventors noted the absence of stability as<br>
regards dimension or behaviour of some substrates more<br>
particularly made of fabric, which are appropriate for<br>
a mass production, more particularly when they are<br>
continuous or moving. The absence of behaviour makes<br>
it difficult or impossible to obtain a precise<br>
positioning of the modules, microcircuits or contact<br>
pads or cavities more particularly by an indexation on<br>
the substrate prior to or after the production of<br>
antennas.<br>
Adding a reinforcing sheet or material or another<br>
fabric to the substrate, with possibly predefined<br>
modules reception cavities such as imagined by the<br>
inventors, would bring dimensional stability to the<br>
substrate but also has drawbacks, because of the<br>
absence of behaviour of the substrate and a difficult<br>
indexation, the cavities might be incorrectly<br>
positioned.<br>
Adding a sheet prior to making the antenna is not<br>
favourable for productivity in embroidery. On the<br>
contrary, adding this reinforcement without any cavity<br>
will bring a dimension of stability to the substrate,<br>
but this would increase the difficulty of a ultrasonic<br>
or thermo-compression connection insofar as there is no<br>
cavity for introducing a chip or a module and bringing<br>
the contact pads of the antenna connection sections<br>
closer to each other and make a correct soldering.<br>
The inventors found out that the electronic<br>
component or contact pads must preferably be placed on<br>
the substrate after the antenna is produced to<br>
facilitate the sewing of the antenna to increase the<br>
production rate and because of the difficulty of<br>
placing and connecting the module, which make it<br>
possible to produce an economical antenna.<br>
In addition, the antenna can be sheathed with an<br>
isolating material, more particularly to make an<br>
isolating bridge which intersect the windings or which<br>
can be associated with non conductive wires or fibres<br>
for solidity reasons or for preventing the breaking of<br>
the wire, or for fixing it on the support. In this<br>
case, the soldering tool can be polluted or soiled<br>
during the connection for the ultrasonic or thermo-<br>
compression soldering since the soldering tool<br>
(thermode) is directly applied to the wire and is in<br>
contact with polluting materials surrounding the<br>
antenna wire in a configuration wherein the module is<br>
positioned adjacent to the windings of the antenna or<br>
below the same.<br>
In addition, as the wire antenna rests on the<br>
substrate and thus the inventors chose a position and a<br>
connection of the pads above the antenna, the latter<br>
may tend to sink into the sheet or fibrous mass added<br>
under the effect of pressure of the soldering means<br>
according to the nature of the material used.<br>
After such considerations, the method of the<br>
figure is composed as follows.<br>
At step 100, the method for producing a device<br>
including a transponder antenna connected to contact<br>
pads includes a step of providing or making an antenna<br>
with connection terminal sections supported by a<br>
substrate.<br>
The antenna is preferably produced by embroidery<br>
or sewing on a flexible support including a fabric.<br>
The antenna wire may include at least an<br>
isolation coating on the whole of its surface. It can<br>
also simultaneously or alternatively be in contact with<br>
isolating wires in places. The antenna wire is fixed<br>
on the substrate using a non conductive wire also<br>
called an embroidery or sewing wire.<br>
Preferably, the antenna wire is a hybrid wire<br>
associated with at least one non conductive wire so as<br>
to enable a better rate of productivity without the<br>
wire breaking.<br>
This non conductive wire surrounds the antenna<br>
wire at least in places and constitutes a kind of<br>
isolating sheath in places.<br>
Preferably, a non conductive wire is thermo-<br>
fusible or thermo-plastic to enable the removal or<br>
elimination thereof around the soldering zone.<br>
Non thermo-fusible wires may be appropriate<br>
insofar as the energy of the soldering is sufficient to<br>
remove the same, to deteriorate the same (or a<br>
sufficient soldering material is added to go through<br>
the same).<br>
However, other techniques for fixing the<br>
conductive wire on the substrate may be chosen among<br>
other less efficient ones such as inlay or etching.<br>
The production of the antenna by embroidery may<br>
preferably include a step of producing a barring stitch<br>
(not shown) of the antenna wire by sewing, embroidery,<br>
knitting at the end of one at least of said terminal<br>
sections. Then preferably, a step of removing said<br>
barring stitch including the removal of material from<br>
the support opposite the barring stitch and possible<br>
formation of a cavity. The antenna terminal sections<br>
or barring stitches may be superimposed or produced in<br>
a zone of the support intended to be removed. In case<br>
of removal of a barring stitch by punching, the<br>
corresponding terminal section extends up to the edge<br>
of a cavity.<br>
As previously mentioned. the support is<br>
preferably a very low thickness fabric but other low<br>
thickness supports can be considered.<br>
At step 200, then according to one<br>
characteristic, the method includes a step during which<br>
a reinforcing material is positioned as a sheet or a<br>
layer on one face of the substrate opposite the one<br>
supporting the terminal sections.<br>
The reinforcing layer or sheet is positioned in<br>
the example, directly after the production of the<br>
antenna.<br>
As already mentioned, an effect similar to the<br>
addition of a sheet can be obtained by impregnation or<br>
coating of a layer or spraying of a product such as a<br>
coating, a primer, a resin, a polymer foam, a gum<br>
capable of stabilising the substrate as regards its<br>
dimensions.<br>
At step 300, as the support is stabilised, it<br>
possible to handle it and to carry out more<br>
conventional operations such as more easily placing<br>
contact pads on the substrate.<br>
However, according to another characteristic, it<br>
is preferred to execute a step of forming a cavity in<br>
the substrate and/or reinforcing sheet or layer close<br>
to the antenna connection terminal sections, so as to<br>
introduce the chip or the module.<br>
The cavity is formed by punching, but a forming<br>
by pressure or embossing or any at least partial<br>
machining of the substrate could also be considered.<br>
At step 400, the pads are placed so as to have a<br>
surface opposite an antenna connection terminal section<br>
resting on the substrate. If need be, a chip can be<br>
placed more particularly using the flip-chip technology<br>
on the pads or on the rear face of the substrate or on<br>
a contact pad for a conventional connection by any<br>
known means or even with a soldered wire type.<br>
The opposite surface used in the description<br>
corresponds to a projection of the longitudinal section<br>
of a wire on a connection pad 8b, or a rectangle the<br>
width of which is generally equal to the diameter of<br>
the wire and length of which is equal to the length of<br>
the pad opposite.<br>
Preferably, the pads are already connected to an<br>
electronic microcircuit such as a chip. And the<br>
microcircuit is inserted at least partially into the<br>
cavity with the pads staying out of the cavity and<br>
resting on the sections of tracks or antenna terminal<br>
ends resting on the support.<br>
A step 500 the pads are connected to the antenna<br>
terminal sections. The connection is made by soldering<br>
with the introduction of energy between the pads and<br>
the terminal sections and the soldering energy is<br>
directly applied onto the pads using a thermode for a<br>
thermo-compression type soldering or an ultrasonic<br>
probe for an ultrasonic soldering.<br>
As regards soldering, an anvil is preferably used<br>
which rests against the recess of the antenna terminal<br>
section in the support. The anvil is all the more<br>
recommended as the antenna wire tends to sink into the<br>
substrate because of the fineness of the wire and/or<br>
softness of the substrate and/or reinforcing material.<br>
The anvil goes through at least the reinforcing<br>
sheet or layer opposite the terminal section to be<br>
connected so that the section to be connected is<br>
supported by the anvil during the soldering operation.<br>
The section of the anvil is rectangular or square for a<br>
section of the order of 0.3xlmm^ to lx5mm^.<br>
The invention more particularly applies as soon<br>
as a kind of "blind" connection of a metal pad must be<br>
performed directly on a track of an antenna or the<br>
terminal section of an antenna, which is also metallic,<br>
and positioned on a softer support than metal by<br>
soldering with or without addition of a soldering<br>
material, the reverse being a conventional operation.<br>
A priori, during the soldering operation, the pressure<br>
transmitted by a track or a terminal section to the<br>
support thereof is more important than the one<br>
transmitted by a pad because of the surface and<br>
pressure ratio. This makes the persons skilled in the<br>
art decide for a connection configuration which is the<br>
reverse of the conventional one.<br>
At step 600, the support is assembled with at<br>
least one sheet on the side opposite the reinforcing<br>
sheet. The sheets may for example be composed of<br>
materials used for the sheets or the cover of a<br>
passport or a chip card or any other object. Then they<br>
are cut to the desired format. If need be, the cutting<br>
may be carried out during other steps.<br>
