				<td>Technical problem<br>
The present invention relates to new anti-inflammatory compounds represented by the general structure I, to their salts and solvates, to processes for their preparation and to the use of these compounds in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions in humans and animals.<br>
Prior art<br>
inti-inflammatory medicaments could be classified into those of steroid and of onsteroid type. Steroid anti-inflammatory compounds are still the most effective ones 1 the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions such as asthma, chronic bstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asal polyps, intestinal diseases such as Crohn"s disease, colitis, ulcerative colitis, ermatological inflammations such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, surodermatitis, pruritis, conjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to the ecellent potency and effectiveness, medicaments of this type also possess numerous nfavourable effects e.g. on carbohydrate metabolism, calcium resorption, secretion of dogenous corticosteroids as well as on physiological functions of hypophysis, irenal cortex and thymus. Hitherto developed steroids are highly effective against inflammation conditions and processes since they inhibit many inflammation lediators whereas their systemic unfavourable effects are diminished. Patent Dplications WO 94/13690, WO 94/14834, WO 92/13873 and WO 92/13872 disclose )-called "soft" steroids or hydrolysable corticosteroids designed for topical application on the inflammation site, whereas their systemic unfavourable effect is iminished due to the instability of "soft" steroids in serum, wherein the active steroid ery rapidly hydrolizes into the inactive form. An ideal steroid, however, without nfavourable effects in a long-term and continuous treatment as required for the control of diseases such as asthma or Crohn"s disease has yet to be found and it has<br><br>
I.	"•  "<br>
been worked intensively on finding and developing steroids with an improved therapeutic profile.<br>
Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medicaments of different mechanisms act on particular inflammation mediators, thus providing a therapeutical effect. Due to different action mechanisms and differences in the inhibition of particular inflammation mediators, the steroid and nonsteroid medicaments possess different profiles of anti-inflammation effects, hence in particular conditions they are used alternatively or preferentially. Unfortunately, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medicaments are not absolutely specific either and demonstrate unfavourable effects when used in greater concentrations or over long periods. It is known that many nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medicaments act as inhibitors of endogenous COX-1 enzyme, which is very important in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. Thus, the use of these medicaments causes injuries of the gastric mucosa and bleeding in numerous patients. For some anti-inflammatory compounds (theophylline) it is known that their therapeutic index is very narrow, which limits their usage.<br>
Macrolide antibiotics accumulate within different cells of organism, especially within phagocyte cells such as mononuclear peripheral blood cells, peritoneal and alveolar macrophages as well as in the liquid surrounding the bronchoalveoiar epithelium (Glaude R. P. et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 33 1989, 277-282; Olsen K. M. et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 40 1996, 2582-2585). Moreover, in the literature also relatively weak inflammatory effects of some macrolides are described. Thus, there has recently been described the anti-inflammatory effect of "erythromycin derivatives {J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 41, 1998, 37-46; WQ 00/42055) and azithromycin derivatives (EP 0283055). An anti-inflammatory effect of some macrolides is also known fi"om in vitro and in vivo studies in experimental animals such as at zimosane-induced peritonitis in mice {J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 30, 1992, 339-348) and at endotoxine-induced neutrophil accumulation in rat trachea (J. Immunol. 159, 1997, 3395-4005). The modulating effect of macrolides upon cytokines<br><br>
such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 156, 1997, 266-271) or interleukin 5 (IL-5) (EP 0775489 and EP 0771564) is known as well.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
Compounds of the structure I differ from hitherto known ones in their new action mechanism characterized by selective accumulation in the organs and cells targeted in the above-mentioned inflammation conditions and diseases. Such action of the new compounds represented by the structure I arises from the macrolide portion M due to the said specific pharmacokinetic properties. Such pharmacokinetic properties enable the compounds represented by the structure I to act exclusively in the inflammation site just in the inflammation cells themselves by inhibiting the production of inflammation mediators. In such a manner the unfavourable systemic effect of both corticosteroids and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory compounds is avoided. After topical application the molecules rapidly accumulate in inflammation cells, wherein they act by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemokines as well as other inflammation mediators and thus suppressing the inflammation. According to the known and established prior art, the compounds represented by the structure I, which are the object of the present invention, their pharmacologically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them have hitherto not been described. Moreover, none of the compounds being the object of the present invention has been described either as an anti-inflammatory substance or as an inhibitor of eosinophilic accumulation in inflammation tissues.<br>

Mainly ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl and cyciohexenyl groups are meant thereby. As already mentioned above for "alkyls", also alkenyls may be straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic ones, where a part of the alkenyl group may include double bonds and may also be substituted when a substituted alkenyl group is in question. Alkenyl also represents both a straight-chain or a branched-chain alkenyl group including or being interrupted by a cycloalkenyl portion.<br>

A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds represented by the structure I.<br>
These compounds can be prepared from the corresponding steroid part represented by the general structures Al to A6, wherein all radicals and symbols have the meanings as defined for substructures Al to A6, and macrolide intermediates represented by the general structures Ml to M6 by linking them via appropriate functional L groups, in an analogous manner, it is also possible to prepare compounds represented by the structure I with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory subunits via their free functionalities suitable for linkage.<br>
From carboxylic acids of steroid subunits represented by the structures Al to A4 and A6, which are prepared as described in the literature (Suzuki, T. et al, Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1998, 3831-3836), (McLean, H. M. et al, J. Pharm. Sci. 1994, 83, 476-480), (Little, R. J. et al, Pharm. Res. 1999, 16, 961-967), (Kertesz D. J. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 2315-2328), (Bodor N. S. US Patent 4.710.495, 1987), a compound of the general formula I can be prepared, where the activation with carboxydiimide and benzotriazole (HOBT) in anhydrous dichloromethane in the presence of a base such as triethylamine at room temperature in a flow of argon is used for the formation of an amide bond (Scheme 1).<br><br><br>
I<br>
Scheme 1<br>
When the linking of macrolide subunits to the steroid subunits takes place via an ester end, the synthesis is performed via the macrolide intermediate M7.<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
Esterification in position 2" of the macrohde can be performed by the reaction with a halogen-substituted acid in dry dichioromethane in the presence of pivaloyl chloride, triethylamine and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), thus forming intermediate-; M7 for linking with carboxylic acids of the subunit A (Scheme 2).<br>
Such an intermediate can further react with the carboxylic functionality of subunit A in case of a steroid subunit such as represented by the structures Al to A4 and A6.<br>
The reaction is performed in dry DMF in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in a flow of argon, yielding a potassium salt of the acid, which in the reaction with the macrolide intermediate gives a compound I of the present invention (Scheme 3).<br><br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
When the macrolide subunit means M2 (a macrolide free of cladinose in position 3), it is also possible to perform the coupling with an anti-inflammatory subunit A via an ester bond, whereat the preparation of intermediates MS and M9 is necessary (Scheme 4).<br><br><br>

Scheme 4<br>
Esterification with the carboxylic group of subunit A occurs selectively due to the protected 2" hydroxy 1 group of macrolide M9, which is also reactive.<br><br>
I.	"  "<br><br>
Scheme 5<br>
The synthesis of a compound of the structure I from a macrolide subunit indicated by Ml is performed from an intermediate, whose synthesis is described in Agouridas C, J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 4080-4100, in the manner and by the use of reagents described therein. From said intermediate M10 a compound of the structure I is synthesized by the reaction with an anti-inflammatory subunit A bearing a carboxylic functionality by the use of potassium carbonate in dry DMF at room temperature (Scheme 6).<br><br><br>
I<br>
Scheme 6<br>
The compounds of the general structure I comprising a compound M3 as the macrolide unit are synthesized by linking a modified anti-inflammatory unit A8 with a macrolide M3, which is prepared according to the already mentioned method (Agouridas C, J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 4080-4100). The anti-inflammatory intermediate A8 is prepared from an acid of the anti-inflammatory compound and a corresponding protected diamine (Boc-protection only from one side) in the presence of hidroxybenzotriazole and EDC in a suitable solvent, preferably dichloromethane or DMF. After obtaining the corresponding amide A7, a deprotection of the terminal<br><br>

amino group is performed by the use of TFA in dichloromethane at room temperature<br>
(Scheme 7).<br><br>
Scheme 7<br>
The intermediate obtained according to the Scheme 7 is reacted in acetonitrile in a flow of nitrogen with a macrolide subunit M12, which is activated by carboxydiimide and comprises protected hydroxyl groups in positions 2" 4" (Scheme 8).<br><br>
f <br>
I<br>
Scheme 8<br>
If the steroid subunit is described as indicated for the general structure AS, wherein all groups and radicals have the meanings as described in the above-mentioned definitions, the coupling reaction with the macrolide group is performed by the esterification of the intermediate A9 obtained according to the literature (HU 55409) and of the macrolide hydroxy 1 group (Scheme 9).<br><br><br>
Scheme 9<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to the use of compounds of the general structure I as anti-inflammmatory, anti-anaphylactic and immunomodufating agents, which, depending on the inflammation site, can be administered in different ways such as percutaneously, orally, buccally, rectally, parenterally or by inhalation when a topical application within the respiratory tract is intended.<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to the preparation of such<br>
pharmaceutical forms of compounds to achieve the optimal bioavailability of the<br>
active compound I. For percutaneous a	<br><br>
in a form of an ointment or a cream, a gel or a lotion. Ointments, creams and gels can be formulated by the use of a water or oil base under the addition of an appropriate emulgator or gelling agent, when a gel form is formulated. The formulation is especially significant for respiratory inhalation, wherein the compound I can be in the form of an aerosol under pressure. For all forms of aerosol formulations it is recommended to micronise the compound I, which has been previously homogenised in lactose, glucose, higher fatty acids, sodium salt of dioctylsulfosuccinic acid or, most preferably, in carboxymethyl cellulose, in order to achieve the size of 5 μ.m for the greatest number of particles. For the inhalation formulation the aerosol can be mixed with a propellant serving for spraying the active substance.<br>
The compound I for inhalation application can be applied in the form of a dry powder with micronised particles.<br>
The compound can also be incorporated in a formulation for treating Crohn"s disease, where it can be administered orally or rectally. The formulation for oral administration must be formulated so as to enable the bioavailability of the compound in the inflammation part of the intestine. This can be achieved by different combination of delayed release formulations. The compound I can also be used in the treatment of Crohn"s disease and intestine inflammation disease if the compound is applied in the form of a cluster, wherefor a suitable formulation can be used.<br>
The appropriate preparations of the compounds that are the object of the present invention can be used in the prophylaxis or treatment of different "diseases and pathological inflammatory conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, intestinal diseases such as Crohn"s disease, colitis, intestine inflammation, ulcerative colitis, dermatological inflammations such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, pruritis, conjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br><br>

The obtained reaction product was cloned into XhoI/BamHI site of Bluescript KS plasmid (Stratagene), subjected to sequencing by dideoxy fluorescent method with Ml3 and M13rev primers (Mycrosynth) and then it was cloned into XhoI/BamHI site of pcDNA3.1 hygro(+)plasmid (Invitrogen). 1 x 105 COS-1 cells were seeded onto a 12-welI plate (Falcon) in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) with 10 % FBS (Biowhitaker) and cultivated up to a 70 % confluence at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5 % CO2. The medium was removed and 1 μg of DNA, 7 ^il of PLUS reagent and 2 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) in 500 μ\ DMEM were added per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5 % CO2 and after 5 hours the same volume of 20 % FBS/DMEM was added. After 24 hours the medium was completely changed. 48 hours after the transfection, the test compounds in different concentrations and 24 nM ["H] dexamethasone (Pharmacia) in DMEM medium were added. The cells were incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5 % CO2, washed three times with PBS buffer (Sigma), cooled to 4 °C (pH = 7.4) and then lyzed in Tris buffer (pH = 8.0) (Sigma) with 0.2 % SDS (Sigma).
