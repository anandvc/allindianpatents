Use of redispersion powder coi^positions with accelerated-setting action<br>
The invention relates to the use of water-redispersible polymef powder compositions with accelerated-setting action in hydraulically setting systems.<br>
Polymers based on vinyl esters, vinyl chloride, (meth)acrylati monomers, styrene, butadiene, and ethylene are used in a wide variety of applications, especially in the form of their aqueous dispersions or water-redispersible polymer powders, for example as coating compositions or adhesives for a very wide variety of substrates. Protective colloids or low-molecular-weight surface-active compounds are used to stabilize these polymers. The protective colloids generally used comprise polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
These products are in particular used as binders in hydraulically setting adhesives, for example in tile adhesives based on cements or calcium sulfate.<br>
Concrete is a very versatile material whose properties can be controlled via numerous parameters. Important properties are, inter alia, workability as a function of time and strength (early strength and final strength) of the concrete. Workability reduces with time as the hydration of the material proceeds. On account of this effect it is possible to add either more water or "superplasticizers". However, both have an adverse effect on the initial and final strength of the concrete. To compensate for these disadvantages, "accelerators" or materials which promote early strength are added, these leading to higher initial and final strength.<br>
EP-A 1135507 describes tertiary alkanolamines as accelerators long known to the person skilled in the art. A disadvantage is<br><br>
that these compounds are highly active nucleophiles and therefore hydrolyze the ester groups in the polymer-containing binders mostly used, based on vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymers or on styrene-acrylane copolymers, and degrade the effectiveness of the binders. In EP-A 1136507 the alkanolamines are therefore linked by a complicated method to a polymer skeleton.<br>
EP-A 1167317 describes the use of alkali metal hydroxides, of alkali metal carbonates, of alkaline earth metal chlorides, and particularly of aluminum salts, as setting accelerators and hardening accelerators for concrete. A disadvantage with the acceleration of cement setting by means of these compounds is, however, the decrease in mechanical strength.<br>
It was therefore an object to provide a means for acceleration of setting of hydraulically setting systems which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art and gives improved strength in the hardened mortar.<br>
The invention provides the use of water-redispersible polymer powder compositions based on a) homo- or copolymers of one or more monomers from the group consisting of vinyl esters of unbranched or branched alkylcarboxylic acids having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, methacrylic esters and acrylic esters of alcohols having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, vinylaromatics, olefins, dienes, and vinyl halides, on one or more protective colloids, and, where appropriate, antiblocking agent, to accelerate the setting of construction chemistry products with hydraulically setting binders, characterized in that b) one or more compounds from the group consisting of alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of inorganic or organic acids are present.<br>
Preference is given to the lithium, sodium, potassium.<br><br>

Preferred organic counter ions are carboxylate groups which derive from carboxylic acid having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. formate ion, acetate ion, propionate ion and butyrate ion. The calcium salts are particularly preferred. The calcium salts of carboxylic acids having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms are most preferred, examples being calcium formate, calcium acetate.<br>

Preferred vinyl esters are vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl 2-ethylhexanoate, vinyl laurate, 1-methylvinyl acetate, vinyl pivalate and vinyl esters of a-branched monocarboxylic acids having from 9 to 13 carbon atoms, for example VeoVa9^ or VeoValO^ {trade names of the company Shell}. Vinyl acetate is particularly preferred.<br>

Examples of olefins and dienes are ethylene, propylene, and 1,3-butadiene. Suitable vinylaromatics are styrene and vinyl-toluene. A suitable vinyl halide is vinyl chloride.<br>
Where appropriate, it is also possible to copolymerize from 0.05 to 50% by weight, preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the base polymer, of auxiliary monomers. Examples of auxiliary monomers are ethylenically unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids, preferably acrylic<br><br>

Mention may also be made of monomers having hydroxyl or CO groups, such as hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, e.g. hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl or hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, and also compounds such as diacetoneacrylamide and acetylacetoxyethyl (meth)acrylate.<br>

copolymers of vinyl acetate containing from 1 to 40% by weight<br>
of ethylene and from 1 to 5 0% by weight of one or more other<br>

and<br>
copolymers containing from 30 to 75% by weight of vinyl<br>
acetate, from 1 to 30% by weight of vinyl laurate, or vinyl<br>
ester of an alpha-branched carboxylic acid having from 9 to<br>
11 carbon atoms, and also from 1 to 30% by weight of acrylates<br>

the polymers may also contain the amounts mentioned of the<br>

case give a total of 100% by weight.<br>
Preference is also given to (meth)acrylate polymers, such as<br>

The selection of monomers and the selection of the proportions by weight of the comonomers here takes place in such a way that the resultant glass transition temperature Tg is generally from -BO^C to +50°C, preferably from -30°C to +40°C. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymers may be determined in a 3cnown manner by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) . The Tg may also be approximated by the Fox equation. According to T. G. Fox,   Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1,   2,   page  123 (1956); 1/Tg = xl/Tgl + x2/Tg2 + . . . + xn/Tgn, where xn is the proportion by weight (% by weight/100) of monomer n and Tgn  is the glass transition temperature in degrees Kelvin of the homopolymer of monomer n. Tg values for homopolymers are listed in Polymer Handbook 2nd Edition, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1975) .<br>
The homo- and copolymers are prepared by emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, preferably by emulsion polymerization, generally at a polymerization temperature of from 40 to 100°C, preferably from 60   to 90°C. When gaseous comonomers, such as ethylene, 1,3-butadiene or vinyl chloride, are copolymerized it is also possible to operate under pressure, generally between 5 bar and 100 bar.<br>
The polymerization is initiated using initiators commonly used for emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, these being water-soluble or, respectively, monomer-soluble initiators, or redox initiator combinations. Examples of water-soluble initiators are the sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts of peroxodisulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, -tert-butyl hydroperoxide, potassium peroxodiphosphate, tert-butyl peroxopivalate, cumene hydroperoxide, isopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide.<br><br>
azobisisobutyronitrile. Examples of monomer-soluble initiators are dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, dicyciohexyl peroxydicarbonate, dibenzoyl peroxide. The amount used of the initiators mentioned is generally from 0.001 to 0.02% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 0.01% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of the monomers.<br>
Redox initiators used are combinations of the initiators mentioned with reducing agents. Suitable reducing agents are the sulfites and bisulfites of alkali metals and of ammonium, for example sodium sulfite, the derivatives of sulfoxylic acid, such as the formaldehyde-sulfoxylate of zinc or of an alkali metal, e.g. sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate, and ascorbic acid. The amount of reducing agent is generally from 0.001 to 0.03% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 0.015% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of the monomers.<br>
To control the molecular weight, regulating substances may be used during the polymerization. If regulators are used, they are usually used in amounts of from 0.01 to 5.0% by weight, based on the monomers to be polymerised, and are fed separately or else dosed in a form premixed with reaction components. Examples of substances of this type are n-dodecyl mercaptan, tert-dodecyl mercaptan, mercaptopropionic acid, methyl mercaptopropionate, isopropanol and acetaldehyde.<br>
Suitable protective colloids are polyvinyl alcohols; polyvinyl acetals; polyvinylpyrrolidones; polysaccharides in water-soluble form, e.g. starches {amylose and amylopectin), celluloses and their carboxymethyl, methyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl derivatives; proteins, such as casein or caseinate, soy protein, gelatin; lignosulfonates; synthetic polymers, such as poly(meth)acrylic acid, copolymers of {meth)acrylates with carboxy-functional comonomer units, polyCmeth)acrylamide, polyvinylsulfonic acids and their water-soluble copolymers; melamine-formaldehyde sulfonates, naphthalene-formaldehyde sulfonates, styrene-maleic acid copolymers and vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymers.<br><br>
Preference is given to partially hydrolyzed or fully tiydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols whose degree of hydrolysis is from 80 to 100 mol%, in particular partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols whose degree of hydrolysis is from 80 to 95 mQl% and whose Hoppler viscosity in 4% aqueous solution is from 1 to 30 mPas {Hoppler method at 20°C, DIN 53015). Preference is also given to partially hydrolyzed, hydrophobicized polyvinyl alcohols whose degree of hydrolysis is from 80 to 95 mol% and whose Hoppler viscosity in 4% strength aqueous solution is from 1 to 30 mPas. Examples of these are partially hydrolyzed copolymers of vinyl acetate with hydrophobic*TO5nomers, such as isopropenyl acetate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl ethylhexanoate, vinyl esters of saturated alpha-branched monocarboxylic acids having 5 or from 9 to 11 carbon atoms, dialkyl maleates, and dialkyl fumarates, e.g. diisopropyl maleate and diisopropyl fumarate, vinyl chloride, vinyl alkyl ethers, such as vinyl butyl ether, olefins, such as ethene and decene. The proportion of the hydrophobic units is preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols. Mixtures of the polyvinyl alcohols mentioned may also be used.<br>
Most preference is given to polyvinyl alcohols whose degree of hydrolysis is from 85 to 94 mol% and whose Hoppler viscosity in 4% strength aqueous solution is from 3 to 15 mPas (Hfippler method at 20°C, DIN 53015) . The protective colloids mentioned are accessible by means of processes known Co the person skilled in the art, their total amounts generally used during the polymerization being from 1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers.<br>
If the polymerization is carried out in the presence of emulsifiers, the amount of these is from 1 to 5% by weight, based on the amount of monomer. Suitable emulsifiers are either anionic, cationic, or non ionic emulsifiers, for example anionic surfactants, such as alkyl sulfates whose chain length is from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, alkyl or alkyl aryl ether<br><br>
sulfates having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the hydrophobic radical and up to 40 ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units, alkyl- or alkylarylsulfonates having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, esters and half-esters of sulfosuccinic acid with monohydric alcohols or with alkylphenols, or non ionic surfactants, such as alkyl polyglycol ethers or alkylaryl polyglycol ethers having from 8 to 40 ethylene oxide units.<br>
After conclusion of the polymerization, post-polymerization may be carried out by known methods to remove residual monomer, generally using redox-catalyst-initiated post-polymerization. Volatile residual monomers may also be removed by distillation, preferably at reduced pressure, and, where appropriate, by passing inert carrier gases, such as air, nitrogen, or steam, through or over the product. The aqueous dispersions thus obtainable have a solids content of from 30 to 75% by weight, preferably from 50 to 60% by weight.<br>
To prepare the water-redispersible polymer powders, the aqueous dispersions are dried, where appropriate after adding protective colloid as spraying aid, for example by means of fluidized-bed drying, freeze drying, or spray drying. The dispersions are preferably spray dried. This spray drying may take place in conventional spray drying systems, with atomization by means of single-, twin-, or multifluid nozzles, or using a rotating disk. The discharge temperature selected is generally in the range from 45°C to 120°C, preferably from 60^C to 90°C, depending on the system, the Tg of the resin, and the desired degree of drying.<br>
The total amount of the spraying aid (protective colloid) used is generally from 3 to 30% by weight, based on the polymeric constituents of the dispersion. This means that the total amount of protective colloid prior to the drying procedure is to be from 3 to 30% by weight, based on the polymer content; it is preferable to use from 5 to 20% by weight, based on the polymer content.<br><br>
Suitable spraying aids are partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols; polyvinylpyrrolidones; polysaccharides in a water-soluble form, such as starches (amyloss and amylopectin), celluloses and their carboxymethyl, methyl, hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl derivatives; proteins, such as casein or caseinate, soy protein, gelatin; lignosulfonate; synthetic polymers, such as poly(meth)acrylic acid, copolymers of (meth)acrylates with carboxy-functional comonomer units, poly(meth)acrylamide, polyvinylsulfonic acids and water-soluble copolymers of these; melamine-formaldehyde sulfonates, naphthalene-formaldehyde sulfonates, styrene-maleic acid copolymers, vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymers. It is preferable that no protective colloids other than polyvinyl alcohols are  used as spraying aids, the polyvinyl alcohols preferred as protective colloids also being used as spraying aids.<br>
Up to 1.5% by weight content of antifoam, based on the base polymer^ has often proven useful during spraying. An antiblocking agent (anticaking agent), preferably at up to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of polymeric constituents, may be added to the powder obtained in order to increase storage stability via an increase in blocking resistance, in particular in the case of powders with a low glass transition temperature. Examples of antiblocking agents are calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, calcium sulfate, silica, kaolins, silicates with particle sizes preferably in the range from 10 nm to 10 ym.<br>
The viscosity of the feed to be sprayed is adjusted via the solids content sc as   to give a "Brookfield viscosity" (at 20 revolutions and 23°C) value of  35%, preferably &gt; 40%.<br>
In order to improve performance characteristics, other additives may be added during the spraying process. Examples of other constituents present in preferred embodiments of<br><br>
dispersion powder compositions are pigments, fillers, foam stabilizers, hydrophobicizing agents.<br>
To prepare the polymer powder composition, the setting-accelerator component is added to the appropriate polymer dispersion immediately prior to the spray drying process and the material is then sprayed. Where appropriate, the setting-accelerator component may also be added after the drying process in powder form. The redispersion powder preferably comprises from 1 to 20% by weight, particularly preferably from 3 to 15% by weight, of the accelerated-setting component, based in each case on the total weight of the polymer powder composition.<br>
The water-redispersible polymer powder compositions may be used in the application sectors typical for these, for example in construction chemistry products, where appropriate in association with hydraulically setting binders, such as cements (Portland, alumina, pozzalanic, slag, magnesia, phosphate cement), calcium sulfate, and water glass, for producing construction adhesives, in particular tile adhesive and exterior insulation system adhesive, plasters and renders, trowelling compositions, floor-filling compositions, self-leveling compositions, sealing slurries, jointing mortars, or paints. Preferred application sectors are spray mortar or spray concrete for construction work in civil or structural engineering, or else in the lining of tunnel walls.<br>
The inventive use gives additives which effectively accelerate cement setting, without any reduction in the mechanical strength of the finished mortar. The user moreover has the advantage of one fewer component requiring handling at the construction site when the mortar is modified with redispersion powder.<br>
Examples:<br>
Dispersion:<br><br>
The dispersion used comprises a polyvinyl alcohol stabilized dispersion of a copolymer of vinyl acetate and ethylene. The preparation method uses emulsion polymerization methods known to the person skilled in the art. 10% by weight of a polyvinyl alcohol whose degree of hydrolysis was 88 mol% and whose Hoppler viscosity was 4 mPas were used for stabilization. The composition of the copolymer was 92% by weight of vinyl acetate and 8% by weight of ethylene.<br>
Powders:<br>
The powders were prepared by spray drying of the dispersion<br>
mentioned with addition of the respective accelerator and 8% by<br>
weight of a polyvinyl alcohol whose degree of hydrolysis was<br>
88 mol% and whose Hoppler viscosity was 4 mPas.<br>
The dispersion was then sprayed by means of a twin-fluid<br>
nozzle. Air previously compressed to 4 bar served as spraying<br>
component, and the droplets formed were dried using air heated<br>
to 125°C and flowing cocurrently. The resultant dried powder<br>
was treated with 10% by weight commercially available<br>
antiblocking agent (calcium magnesium carbonate).<br>
Accelerators:<br>
CaAc = calcium acetate<br>
CaFo = calcium formate<br>
CaNi = calcium nitrate<br>
AmSu = ammonium aluminum sulfate (comparison)<br>
AlSu =   aluminum sulfate (comparison)<br>
AlAc = Aluminum acetate (comparison)<br>
CaPh = calcium phosphate<br>
LiCo = lithium carbonate<br>
NaAc - sodium acetate<br>
NaFo = sodium formate<br>
KAc  = potassium acetate<br>
KFo  - potassium formate<br>
LiAc - lithium acetate<br>
Testing:<br><br>
The powders obtained were tested for powder properties, and for the effectiveness of the accelerator in concrete.<br>
Flowability F:<br>
Flowability was only assessed visually via angle of rest.<br>
Determination of blocking resistance BR:<br>
To determine blocking resistance, the dispersion powder was placed in an iron pipe with a thread, and then subjected to a load from a metal ram. After the load had been applied, the material was stored for 16 hours at 50°C in a drying cabinet. After cooling to room temperature, the powder was removed from the tube, and resistance to blocking was determined qualitatively by crushing the material. Resistance to blocking was classified as follows: 1-3  = very good blocking resistance 4-6  = good blocking resistance 7-8  = satisfactory blocking resistance<br>
9 - 10 = not resistant to blocking - powder no longer free-flowing after crushing of the material.<br>
Determination of sedimentation performance TS:<br>
The sedimentation performance of the redispersion serves as a<br>
measure of the redispersibility of the powder. The<br>
redispersions were produced at 50% strength in water by the<br>
action of large shear forces.<br>
Sedimentation performance was then determined on diluted<br>
redispersions (0.5% solids content), and for this 100 ml of<br>
this dispersion was charged to a graduated tube, and the<br>
sedimentation height of solid was measured. The data given are<br>
mm of sediment after 24 hours. Values greater than 7 indicate<br>
inadequate redispersion of the powder.<br>
The results of the testing of flowability F, of blocking resistance BR, and of sedimentation performance TS of the redispersion powders are given in Table 1.<br><br>
Determination of tensile bond strengths of a cementitious tile adhesive modified with the redispersion powders:<br>
Tensile bond strengths in the tile adhesive were tested in the following mixing specification (3% polymer content):<br>
Quartz sand	565 parts<br>
Portland cement	400 parts<br>
Cellulose	5 parts<br>
Redispersion powder	30 parts<br>
Tensile bond strengths were determined using three storage<br>
conditions:<br>
28d:	28 days of dry storage<br>
7d/21w:	7 days dry/21 days wet (wet storage)<br>
14d/14dc+70°C/ld:	storage under hot conditions<br>
Table 2 gives the results of this test.<br><br>
