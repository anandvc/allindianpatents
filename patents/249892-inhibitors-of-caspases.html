				<td>TECHNICAL  FIELD  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
The present  invention relates to novel<br>
classes  of compounds which are  caspase  inhibitors, in<br>
particular interleukin-1β  converting enzyme ("ICE")<br>
inhibitors. This  invention also relates to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions  comprising these  compounds.<br>
The compounds  and pharmaceutical compositions  of  this<br>
invention are particularly well suited for  inhibiting<br>
caspase  activity and consequently, may be<br>
advantageously used as  agents against  interleukin-1-<br>
("IL-1"), apoptosis-, interferon-γ inducing  factor-<br>
(IGIF), or interferon-γ- ("IFN-γ") mediated diseases,<br>
including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune  diseases,<br>
destructive bone disorders,  proliferative disorders,<br>
infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. This<br>
invention also relates to methods for inhibiting<br>
caspase  activity and decreasing  IGIF production and<br>
IFN-γ production and methods for treating interleukin-<br>
l, apoptosis-, and interferon-γ- mediated diseases using<br>
the  compounds and compositions of  this  invention. This<br>
invention also relates to methods of preparing the<br>
compounds of this  invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF  THE INVENTION<br>
Interleukin l ("IL-l") is a major pro-<br>
inflammatory and  immunoregulatory protein that<br>
stimulates  fibroblast  differentiation and<br>
proliferation, the production of prostaglandins,<br><br>
collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and<br>
chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and<br>
neutrophil activation.  Oppenheim, J.H. et al,<br>
Immunology Today, 7, pp. 45-56 (1986) .  As such, it is<br>
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute<br>
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.  For example, in<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 is both a mediator of<br>
inflammatory symptoms and of the destruction of the<br>
cartilage proteoglycan in afflicted joints.  Wood, D.D.<br>
et al. , Arthritis Rheum. 26, 975, (1983); Pettipher,<br>
E.J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 295 (1986);<br>
Arend, W.P. and Dayer, J.M., Arthritis Rheum. 38, 151<br>
(1995) .  IL-1 is also a highly potent bone resorption<br>
agent.  Jandiski, J.J., J. Oral Path 17, 145 (1988);<br>
Dewhirst, F.E. et al., J. Immunol. 8, 2562 1985).  It<br>
is alternately referred to as "osteoclast activating<br>
factor" in destructive bone diseases such as<br>
osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma.  Bataille, R. et<br>
al., Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 21(4), 283 (1992).  In<br>
certain proliferative disorders, such as acute<br>
myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, IL-1 can<br>
promote tumor cell'growth and adhesion.  Bani, M.R., J.<br>
Natl. Cancer Inst. 83, 123 (1991); Vidal-Vanaclocha,<br>
F., Cancer Res. 54, 2667 (1994).  In these disorders,<br>
IL-1 also stimulates production of other cytokines such<br>
as IL-6, which can modulate tumor development (Tartour<br>
et al., Cancer Res. 54, p. 6243 (1994).  IL-1 is<br>
predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as<br>
part of the inflammatory response and exists in two<br>
distinct agonist forms, IL-la and IL-lp.  Mosely, B.S.<br>
et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 84, pp. 4572-4576<br>
(1987); Lonnemann, G. et al. , Eur. J. Immunol. , 19, pp.<br>
1531-1536 (1989) .<br>
IL-ip is synthesized as a biologically<br>
inactive precursor, pIL-1β.  pIL-1β lacks a<br><br>
conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a<br>
signal peptidase.  March, C.J., Nature, 315, pp.641-647<br>
(1985) .  Instead, pIL-1β is cleaved by interleukin-1β<br>
converting enzyme ("ICE") between Asp-116 and Ala-117<br>
to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment<br>
found in human serum and synovial fluid.  Sleath, P.R.,<br>
et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, pp.14526-14528 (1992);<br>
A.D. Howard et al. , J. Immunol. , 147, pp.2964-2969<br>
(1991) .  ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily<br>
in monocytes.  It converts precursor IL-1β to the<br>
mature form.  Black, R.A. et al., FEBS Lett. , 247, pp. -<br>
386-390 (1989); Kostura, M.J. et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. U.S.A., 86, pp.5227-5231 (1989).  Processing by<br>
ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1β<br>
through the cell membrane.<br>
ICE (or caspase-1) is a member of a family of<br>
homologous enzymes called caspases.  These homologs<br>
have sequence similarities in the active site regions<br>
of the enzymes.  Such homologs (caspases) include TX<br>
(or ICErel-II or ICH-2) (caspase-4) (Faucheu, et al. ,<br>
EMBO J., 14, p. 1914 (1995); Kamens J., et al. , J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 270, p. 15250 (1995); Nicholson et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. , 270 15870 (1995)), TY (or ICErel-III)<br>
(caspase-5) (Nicholson et al., J. Biol. Chem. , 270, p.<br>
15870 (1995); ICH-1 (orNedd-2) (caspase-2) (Wang, L.<br>
et al., Cell. 78, p. 739 (1994)), MCH-2 (caspase-6),<br>

(caspase-14) (Hu, S. et.al., J. Biol. Chem., 273(45) p.<br>
29648-29653 (1998)).<br>
Each of these ICE homologs, as well as ICE<br>
itself, is capable of inducing apoptosis when<br>
overexpressed in transfected cell lines.  Inhibition of<br>
one or more of these homologs with the peptidyl ICE<br>
inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone results in<br>
inhibition of apoptosis in primary cells or cell lines.<br>
Lazebnik et al., Nature, 371, p. 346. (1994).<br>
Caspases also appear to be involved in the<br>
regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis.<br>
Yuan, J. et al., Cell, 75, pp.641-652 (1993); Miura, M.<br>
et al., Cell, 75, pp. 653-660 (1993); Nett-Fiordalisi,<br>
M.A. et al., J. Cell Biochem., 17B, p. 117 (1993).  In<br>
particular, ICE or ICE homologs are thought to be<br>
associated with the regulation of apoptosis in<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and<br>
Parkinson's disease. Marx, J. and M. Baringa, Science,<br>
259, pp. 760-762 (1993); Gagliardini, V. et al. ,<br>
Science, 263, pp. 826-828 (1994).  Therapeutic<br>
applications for inhibition of apoptosis may include<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,<br>
stroke, myocardial infarction, spinal atrophy, and<br>
aging.<br><br>
ICE has been demonstrated to mediate<br>
apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain tissue<br>
types.  Steller, H., Science, 267, p. 1445 (1995);<br>
Whyte, M. and Evan, G., Nature, 376, p. 17 (1995);<br>
Martin, S.J. and Green, D.R., Cell, 82, p. 349 (1995);<br>
Alnemri, E.S., et al., J. Biol. Chetn. , 270, p. 4312<br>
(1995); Yuan, J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. , 7, p. 211<br>
(1995) .  A transgenic mouse with a disruption of the<br>
ICE gene is deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis (Kuida,<br>
K. et al. , Science 267, 2000 (1995)).  This activity of<br>
ICE is distinct from its role as the processing enzyme<br>
for pro-IL-1β.  It is conceivable that in certain<br>
tissue types, inhibition of ICE may not affect<br>
secretion of mature IL-1β, but may inhibit apoptosis.<br>
Enzymatically active ICE has been previously<br>
described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits,<br>
p20 and p10 (20kDa and 10kDa molecular weight,<br>
respectively) .  These subunits are derived from a 45kDa<br>
proenzyme (p4 5) by way of a p3 0 form, through an<br>
activation mechanism that is autocatalytic.<br>
Thornberry, N.A. et al. , Nature, 356, pp.768-774<br>
(1992) .  The ICE proenzyme has been divided into<br>
several functional domains:  a prodomain (pl4), a<br>
p22/2 0 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit.<br>
Thornberry et al., supra; Casano et al. , Genomics, 20,<br>
pp. 474-481 (1994).<br>
Full length p4 5 has been characterized by its<br>
cDNA and amino acid sequences.  PCT patent applications<br>
WO 91/15577 and WO 94/00154.  The p20 and plO cDNA and<br>
amino acid sequences are also known.  Thornberry et<br>
al. , supra. Murine and rat ICE have also been sequenced<br>
and cloned.  They have high amino acid and nucleic acid<br>
sequence homology to human ICE.  Miller, D.K. et al. ,<br>
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 696, pp. 133-148 (1993);<br>
Molineaux, S.M. et al . , Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 90, pp.<br><br>
1809-1813 (1993).  The three-dimensional structure of<br>
ICE has been determined at atomic resolution by X-ray<br>
crystallography.  Wilson, K.P., et al. , Nature, 370,<br>
pp. 270-275 (1994).  The active enzyme exists as a<br>
tetramer of two p20 and two p10 subunits.<br>
Recently, ICE and other members of the<br>
ICE/CED-3 family have been linked to the conversion of<br>
pro-IGIF to IGIF or to the production of IFN-γ in  vivo<br>
(PCT application PCT/US96/20843, publication no. WO<br>
97/22619, which is incorporated herein by reference).<br>
IGIF is synthesized in vivo  as the precursor protein<br>
"pro-IGIF".<br>
Interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) is an<br>
approximately 18-kDa polypeptide that stimulates T-cell<br>
production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ).  IGIF is<br>
produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages in<br>
vivo  and is exported out of such cells upon endotoxin<br>
stimulation.  Thus, a compound that decreases IGIF<br>
production would be useful as an inhibitor of such T-<br>
cell stimulation which in turn would reduce the levels<br>
of IFN-γ production by those cells.<br>
IFN-γ is a cytokine with immunomodulatory<br>
effects on a variety of immune cells.  In particular,<br>
IFN-γ is involved in macrophage activation and Th1 cell<br>
selection (F. Belardelli, APMIS, 103, p. 161 (1995)).<br>
IFN-γ exerts its effects in part by modulating the<br>
expression of genes through the STAT and IRF pathways<br>
(C. Schindler and J.E. Darnell, Ann. Rev. Biochem. , 64,<br>
p. 621 (1995); T. Taniguchi, J. Cancer Res. Clin.<br>
Oncol., 121, p. 516 (1995)).<br>
Mice lacking IFN-γ or its receptor have<br>
multiple defects in immune cell function and are<br>
resistant tc endotoxic shock (S. Huang et al. , Science,<br>
259, p.1742 (1993); D. Dalton et al., Science, 259, p.-<br>
1739 (1993); B.D. Car et al., J. Exp. Med.. 179, p.1437<br><br>
(1994)). Along with  IL-12, IGIF appears to be a potent<br>
inducer of IFN-γ production by T cells (H. Okamura et<br>
al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p.3966 (1995); H.<br>
Okamura et  al.,  Nature, 378,  p.88 (1995); S. Ushio et<br>
al., J.Immunol., 156, p.4274  (1996)).<br>
IFN-γ has  been shown to contribute  to the<br>
pathology associated with a variety of inflammatory,<br>
infectious  and autoimmune disorders  and  diseases.<br>
Thus, compounds capable of decreasing  IFN-γ production<br>
would be useful  to  ameliorate  the  effects  of IFN-γ<br>
related pathologies.<br>
Accordingly, compositions and methods capable<br>
of regulating  the  conversion of  pro-IGIF  to  IGIF would<br>
be  useful  for decreasing  IGIF and  IFN-γ production  in<br>
vivo, and thus  for ameliorating the detrimental effects<br>
of  these proteins  which contribute  to human disorders<br>
and diseases.<br>
Caspase  inhibitors represent  a class of<br>
compounds useful  for the  control of  inflammation or<br>
apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl  inhibitors of<br>
ICE have been described (PCT patent applications<br>
WO 91/15577, WO 93/05071, WO  93/09135, WO  93/12076,<br>
WO 93/14777, WO  93/16710, WO  95/35308, WO  96/30395,<br>
WO  96/33209 and WO  98/01133; European patent<br>
applications 503 561, 547 699, 618 223, 623 592, and<br>
623 606; and  US  patent  nos. 5,434,248, 5,710,153,<br>
5,716,929, and  5,744,451). Such peptidyl  inhibitors  of<br>
ICE have been observed to block the production of<br>
mature  IL-1β  in a mouse model of  inflammation (vide<br>
infra) and  to suppress growth of  leukemia cells  in<br>
vitro (Estrov et  al. , Blood, 84, 380a (1994)).<br>
However, due to their peptidic nature, such inhibitors<br>
are  typically characterized by undesirable<br>
pharmacologic properties, such as poor cellular<br>
penetration  and  cellular  activity, poor  oral<br><br>
absorption, instability and rapid metabolism.<br>
Plattner, J.J. and D.W. Norbeck, in Drug Discovery<br>
Technologies, C.R. Clark and W.H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis<br>
Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp.92-126.  These<br>
properties has hampered their development into<br>
effective drugs.<br>
Non-peptidyl compounds have also been<br>
reported to inhibit ICE in vitro. PCT patent<br>
application WO 95/26958; US Patent 5,552,400; Dolle et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem., 39, pp. 2438-2440 (1996).<br>
It is not clear however whether these<br>
compounds have the appropriate pharmacological profiles<br>
to be therapeutically useful.<br>
Accordingly, the need exists for compounds<br>
that can effectively inhibit caspases, and that have<br>
favorable in vivo  activity, for use as agents for<br>
preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-<br>
1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases, as<br>
well as inflammatory, autoimmune, destructive bone,<br>
proliferative, infectious, or degenerative diseases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel classes<br>
of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives thereof, that are useful as caspase<br>
inhibitors, in particular, as ICE inhibitors.  These<br>
compounds can be used alone or in combination with<br>
other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as<br>
antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis<br>
of diseases mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF, or IFN-<br>
γ.  According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds<br>
of this invention are capable of binding to the active<br>
site of a caspase and inhibiting the activity of that<br>
enzyme.<br><br>
It is a principal object of this invention to<br>
provide novel classes of compounds represented by<br>
formula I, which have favorable in  vivo  profiles:<br><br>
wherein the various substituents are described<br>
herein.<br>
It is a further objective of this invention<br>
to provide pharmaceutical compositions, including<br>
multi-component compositions.  This invention also<br>
provides methods for using and preparing the compounds<br>
of this invention and related compounds.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order that the invention described herein<br>
may be more fully understood, the following detailed<br>
description is set forth.<br>
The following abbreviations and definitions<br>
are used throughout the application.<br><br><br><br>
The term "caspase" refers to an enzyme that<br>
is a member of the family of enzymes that includes ICE<br>
(see H. Hara, Natl. Acad. Sci., 94, pp. 2007-2012<br>
(1997) ) .<br>
The terms "HBV", "HCV" and "HGV" refer to<br>
hepatitis-B virus, hepatitis-C virus and hepatitis-G<br>
virus, respectively.<br>
The term "Ki" refers to a numerical measure<br>
of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting the<br>
activity of a target enzyme such as ICE.  Lower values<br>
of Ki. reflect higher effectiveness.  The Ki value is a<br>
derived by fitting experimentally determined rate data<br>
to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I.H. Segel,<br>
Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).<br>
The term "interferon gamma inducing factor"<br>

that more than one atom or group is bonded to a<br>
particular atom; or 2) a branching point (i.e., the<br>
atom immediately before the open parenthesis is bonded<br>
both to the atom or group in the parentheses and the<br>
atom or group immediately after the closed<br>
parenthesis) .  An example of the first use is<br>
"-N(alkyl)2", indicating two alkyl groups bond to an N<br>
atom.  An example of the second use is "-C(O)NH2",<br>

The compounds of this invention may contain<br>
one or more "asymmetric" carbon atoms and thus may<br>
occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single<br>
enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual<br>
diastereomers. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R<br>
or S configuration.  Although specific compounds and<br>
scaffolds exemplified in this application may be<br>
depicted in a particular stereochemical configuration,<br>
compounds and scaffolds having either the opposite<br>
stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures<br>
thereof are also envisioned.<br>
All such isomeric forms of these compounds<br>
are expressly included in the present invention, as<br>
well as pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of this<br>
invention or any other compound which, upon<br>
administration to a recipient, is capable of providing<br>
(directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention<br>
or an active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include, for example, those<br>
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and<br>
organic acids and bases.  Examples of suitable acids<br>
include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric,<br>
perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic,<br>
lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfonic,<br>
tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic,<br>
benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic and<br>
benzenesulfonic acids.  Other acids, such as oxalic,<br>
while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as<br>
intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the<br>
invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts.  Salts derived from appropriate bases<br>
include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(C1-4  alkyl)4+<br>
salts.<br>
This invention also envisions the<br>
"quaternization" of any basic nitrogen-containing<br>
groups of the compounds disclosed herein.  The basic<br>
nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art including, for<br>
example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides;<br>
dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl<br>
and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl,<br>
lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and<br><br>
iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and<br>
phenethyl bromides.  Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispersible products may be obtained by such<br>
guaternization.<br>
When multiply substituted, each substituent<br>
may be picked independently of any other substituent as<br>
long as the combination of substituents results in the<br>
formation of a stable compound.<br>
Combinations of substituents and variables<br>
envisioned by this invention are only those that result<br>
in the formation of stable compounds.  The term<br>
"stable", as used herein, refers to compounds which<br>
possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and<br>
administration to a mammal by methods known in the art.<br>
Typically, such compounds are stable at a temperature<br>
of 4 0 °C or less, in the absence of moisture or other<br>
chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.<br>
Preferred compounds of this invention may be<br>
readily absorbed by the bloodstream of patients upon<br>
oral administration.  This oral availability makes such<br>
compounds excellent agents for orally-administered<br>
treatment and prevention regimens against IL-1-,<br>
apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases.<br>
It should be understood that the compounds of<br>
this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms,<br>
depending on conditions including choice of solvent,<br>
pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the<br>
art.  All such forms of these compounds are expressly<br>
included in the present invention.  In particular, many<br>
of the compounds of this invention, especially those<br>
which contain aldehyde or ketone groups and carboxylic<br>
acid groups in Y, may take hemi-acetal or hydrated<br>
forms.  For example, compounds of embodiment A are in a<br>
hemiacetal form when Y is:<br><br><br>
Depending on the choice of solvent and other<br>
conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the<br>
art, compounds of this invention may also take<br>
hydrated, acyloxy acetal, acetal, or enol forms.  For<br>
example, compounds of this invention are in hydrated<br>
forms when Y is:<br><br>
acyloxy acetal forms when Y is:<br><br>
acetal forms when Y is and R8 is other than H:<br><br>
and enol forms when Y is:<br><br><br>
In addition, it should be understood that the<br>
equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention<br>
may include tautomeric forms.  All such forms of these<br>
compounds are expressly included in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be synthesized<br>
using conventional techniques.  Advantageously, these<br>
compounds are conveniently synthesized from readily<br>
available starting materials.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be prepared<br>
using the processes described herein. As can be<br>
appreciated by the skilled practitioner, these<br>
processes are not the only means by which the compounds<br>
described and claimed in this application may be<br>
synthesized.  Further methods will be evident to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.  Additionally, the<br>
various synthetic steps described herein may be<br>
performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the<br>
desired compounds.<br>
It should be understood that the compounds of<br>
this invention may be modified by appropriate<br>
functionalities to enhance selective biological<br>
properties.  Such modifications are known in the art<br>
and include those which increase biological penetration<br>
into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic<br>
system, central nervous system), increase oral<br>
availability, increase solubility to allow<br><br>
administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter<br>
rate of excretion.  In addition, the compounds may be<br>
altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound<br>
is created in the body of the patient as the result of<br>
the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes<br>
on the pro-drug.  Such pro-drug forms typically<br>
demonstrate little or no activity in in  vitro  assays.<br>
Some examples of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal,<br>
oxime, imine and hydrazone forms of compounds which<br>
contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where<br>
they occur in the Y group of the compounds of this<br>
invention.  Other examples of pro-drug forms include<br>
the hemi-ketal, hemi-acetal, acyloxy ketal, acyloxy<br>
acetal, ketal, acetal and enol forms that are described<br>
herein.<br><br>
Compositions and Methods<br>
The compounds of this invention are caspase<br>
inhibitors, and in particular ICE inhibitors.<br>
Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting<br>
and inhibiting events in IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, and<br>
IFN-γ-mediated diseases, and, thus, the ultimate<br>
activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases,<br>
autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative<br>
disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative<br>
diseases.  For example, the compounds of this invention<br>
inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1β to mature IL-<br>
1β by inhibiting ICE.  Because ICE is essential for the<br>
production of mature IL-1, inhibition of that enzyme<br>
effectively blocks initiation of IL-1-mediated<br>
physiological effects and symptoms, such as<br>
inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature<br>
IL-1.  Thus, by inhibiting IL-1β precursor activity,<br>
the compounds of this invention effectively function as<br>
IL-1 inhibitors.<br>
Compounds of this invention also inhibit<br>
conversion of pro-IGIF into active, mature IGIF by<br>
inhibiting ICE.  Because ICE is essential for the<br>
production of mature IGIF, inhibition of ICE<br>
effectively blocks initiation of IGIF-mediated<br>
physiological effects and symptoms, by inhibiting<br>
production of mature IGIF.  IGIF is in turn essential<br>
for the production of IFN-γ. ICE therefore effectively<br>
blocks initiation of IFN-γ- mediated physiological<br>
effects and symptoms, by inhibiting production of<br>
mature IGIF and thus production of IFN-γ.<br>
The compounds of this invention are<br>
surprisingly bioavailable when compared with peptidyl<br>
inhibitors, such as those described in, for example,<br>
EP 618 223, EP 623 592, WO 93/09135, WO 93/16710, US<br>
patent no. 5,434,248, WO 95/35308, or WO 96/33209.<br><br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of<br>
this invention will be useful for controlling caspase<br>
activity in vivo. The compositions and methods of this<br>
invention will therefore be useful for controlling IL-<br>
1, IGIF, or IFN-γ levels in vivo  and for treating or<br>
reducing the advancement, severity or effects of IL-1-,<br>
apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated conditions,<br>
including diseases, disorders or effects.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention<br>
comprise a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.  Such compositions may optionally<br>
comprise an additional therapeutic agent.  Such agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, an anti-inflammatory<br>
agent, a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, a<br>
lipoxygenase inhibitor, a cytokine antagonist, an<br>
immunosuppressant, an anti-cancer agent, an anti-viral<br>
agent, a cytokine, a growth factor, an immunomodulator,<br>
a prostaglandin or an anti-vascular hyperproliferation<br>
compound.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier" refers to a non-toxic carrier that may be<br>
administered to a patient, together with a compound of<br>
this invention, and which does not destroy the<br>
pharmacological activity thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may<br>
be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, ion<br>
exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum<br>
proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer<br>
substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid,<br>
potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of<br>
saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or<br>
electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate,<br><br>
sodium chloride, zinc  salts, colloidal  silica,<br>
magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes,<br>
polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat<br>
and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such<br>
as a-tocopherol, polyethyleneglycol  1000  succinate, or<br>
other similar polymeric delivery matrices.<br>
In pharmaceutical  composition comprising only<br>
a  compound of  embodiments A-D as the  active  component,<br>
methods  for administering these compositions may<br>
additionally comprise  the  step of administering to the<br>
subject  an additional  agent. Such agents  include, but<br>
are not  limited to, an anti-inflammatory agent, a<br>
matrix metalloprotease  inhibitor, a lipoxygenase<br>
inhibitor, a cytokine antagonist, an immunosuppressant,<br>
an anti-cancer agent, an anti-viral agent, a cytokine,<br>
a growth factor, an immunomodulator, a prostaglandin or<br>
an anti-vascular hyperproliferation compound.<br>
The  term "pharmaceutically effective amount"<br>
refers to an amount effective in treating or<br>
ameliorating an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or  IFN-<br>
y-mediated disease in a patient. The term<br>
"prophylactically effective amount"  refers to an amount<br>
effective in preventing or substantially lessening IL-<br>
1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases  in a<br>
patient.<br>
The  compounds of  this invention may be<br>
employed in a conventional manner for controlling  IGIF<br>
and IFN-γ levels  in vivo and for treating diseases or<br>
reducing  the  advancement  or  severity of  effects which<br>
are  mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF, or  IFN-γ. Such<br>
methods  of  treatment, their dosage levels  and<br>
requirements may be  selected by those  of  ordinary skill<br>
in  the  art  from available methods and techniques.<br><br>
For example, a compound of this invention may<br>
be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant<br>
for administration to a patient suffering from an<br>
IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated disease in<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount<br>
effective to lessen the severity of that disease.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of this<br>
invention may be used in compositions and methods for<br>
treating or protecting individuals against IL-1,<br>
apoptosis-, IGIF, or IFN-γ mediated diseases over<br>
extended periods of time.  The compounds may be<br>
employed in such compositions either alone or together<br>
with other compounds of this invention in a manner<br>
consistent with the conventional utilization of enzyme<br>
inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions.  For<br>
example, a compound of this invention may be combined<br>
with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants<br>
conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in<br>
prophylactically effective amounts to protect<br>
individuals over an extended period of time against IL-<br>
1-, apoptosis-, IGIF, or IFN-γ mediated diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I may also be co-<br>
administered with other caspase or ICE inhibitors to<br>
increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against<br>
various IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ mediated<br>
diseases.<br>
In addition, the compounds of this invention<br>
may be used in combination either conventional anti-<br>
inflammatory agents or with matrix metalloprotease<br>
inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors and antagonists of<br>
cytokines other than IL-1β.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be<br>
administered in combination with immunomodulators<br>
(e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha-interferon<br>
antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin,<br><br>
interferon-alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor<br>
necrosis factor, naltrexone and EPO), with<br>
prostaglandins, or with antiviral agents (e.g., 3TC,<br>
polysulfated polysaccharides, ganiclovir, ribavirin,<br>
acyclovir, alpha interferon, triraethotrexate and<br>
fancyclovir) or prodrugs of these or related compounds<br>
to prevent or combat IL-1-mediated disease symptoms<br>
such as inflammation.<br>
When the compounds of this invention are<br>
administered in combination therapies with other<br>
agents, they may be administered sequentially or<br>
concurrently to the patient.  Alternatively,<br>
pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according<br>
to this invention comprise a combination of a compound<br>
of formula I and another therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by<br>
inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally,<br>
buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir.  We<br>
prefer oral administration.  The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention may contain any<br>
conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
carriers, adjuvants or vehicles.  In some cases, the pH<br>
of the formulation may be adjusted with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to<br>
enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its<br>
delivery form.  The term parenteral as used herein<br>
includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial,<br>
intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and<br>
intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the<br>
form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example,<br>
as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br><br>
suspension.  This suspension may be formulated<br>
according to techniques known in the art using suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example,<br>
Tween 80) and suspending agents.  The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a<br>
solution in 1,3-butanediol.  Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are<br>
mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium<br>
chloride solution.  In addition, sterile, fixed oils<br>
are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending<br>
medium.  For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be<br>
employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides.<br>
Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride<br>
derivatives are useful in the preparation of<br>
injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in<br>
their polyoxyethylated versions.  These oil solutions<br>
or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol<br>
diluent or dispersant, such as those described in<br>
Pharmacopeia Helvetica, or a similar alcohol.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and<br>
solutions.  In the case of tablets for oral use,<br>
carriers which are commonly used include lactose and<br>
corn starch.  Lubricating agents, such as magnesium*<br>
stearate, are also typically added.  For oral<br>
administration in a capsule form, useful diluents<br>
include lactose and dried corn starch.  When aqueous<br>
suspensions and solutions and propylene glycol are<br>
administered orally, the active ingredient is combined<br>
with emulsifying and suspending agents.  If desired,<br><br>
certain sweetening and/or  flavoring and/or  coloring<br>
agents may be added.<br>
The pharmaceutical  compositions  of  this<br>
invention may also be  administered in the  form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These<br>
compositions can be prepared by mixing a  compound of<br>
this invention with a  suitable non-irritating excipient<br>
which is solid at room temperature but liquid at  the<br>
rectal  temperature and therefore will melt in the<br>
rectum to release the  active  components. Such<br>
materials include, but  are not  limited to, cocoa<br>
butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical administration of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention is especially useful<br>
when the desired treatment  involves areas  or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical  application. For<br>
application topically to the  skin, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition should be  formulated with a suitable<br>
ointment  containing the active components  suspended or<br>
dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not  limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petroleum,  white petroleum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition can be formulated with a suitable  lotion or<br>
cream containing the active compound suspended or<br>
dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers  include, but<br>
are not  limited to, mineral  oil, sorbitan monostearate,<br>
polysorbate 60, cetyl  esters wax, cetearyl  alcohol, 2-<br>
octyldodecanol, benzyl  alcohol  and water. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of  this invention may also<br>
be topically applied to the  lower intestinal  tract by<br>
rectal  suppository formulation or in a suitable enema<br><br>
formulation.  Topically-administered transdermal<br>
patches are also included in this invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation.  Such compositions are prepared according<br>
to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable<br>
preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance<br>
bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other<br>
solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.<br>
Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about<br>
100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.5<br>
and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day and most<br>
preferably between about 1 and 50 mg/kg body weight per<br>
day of the active ingredient compound are useful in a<br>
monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of IL-1-,<br>
apoptosis-, IGIF-, and IFN-γ mediated diseases,<br>
including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases,<br>
destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders,<br>
infectious diseases, degenerative diseases, necrotic<br>
diseases, inflammatory peritonitis, osteoarthritis,<br>
acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, asthma, adult<br>
respiratory distress syndrome, glomerulonephritis,<br>

collitis, infectious hepatitis, juvenile diabetes,<br>
lichenplanus, acute dermatomyositis, eczema, primary<br>
cirrhosis, uveitis, Behcet's disease, atopic skin<br>
disease, pure red cell aplasia, aplastic anemia,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome and<br>
systemic diseases or diseases with effects localized in<br>
the liver or other organs having an inflammatory or<br>
apoptotic component caused by excess dietary alcohol<br>
intake or viruses, such as HBV, HCV, HGV, yellow fever<br>
virus, dengue fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis<br>
virus.<br>
Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
this invention will be administered from about 1 to 5<br>
times per day or alternatively, as a continuous<br>
infusion.  Such administration can be used as a chronic<br>
or acute therapy.  The amount of active ingredient that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the host<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.  A<br>
typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about<br>
95% active compound (w/w) .  Preferably, such<br>
preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active<br>
compound.<br>
When the compositions of this invention<br>
comprise a combination of a compound of formula I and<br>
one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
agents, both the compound and the additional agent<br>
should be present at dosage levels of between about 10%<br><br>
to 80% of the dosage normally administered in a<br>
monotherapy regime.<br>
Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a<br>
maintenance dose of a compound, composition or<br>
combination of this invention may be administered, if<br>
necessary.  Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of<br>
administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function<br>
of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved<br>
condition is retained when the symptoms have been<br>
alleviated to the desired level, treatment should<br>
cease.  Patients may, however, require intermittent<br>
treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence or<br>
disease symptoms.<br>
As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower<br>
or higher doses than those recited above may be<br>
required.  Specific dosage and treatment regimens for<br>
any particular patient will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors, including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health<br>
status, s-x, diet, time of administration, rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of<br>
the disease, and the patient's disposition to the<br>
disease and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>

HPLC Mass Spectral Analysis<br>
Mass Spectral Analysis: All mass spectral<br>
data were collected using a Micromass Quattro II triple<br>
guadrupole mass spectrometer (Beverly, MA) equipped<br>
with a cross-flow electrospray ionization source.  The<br>
mass spectrometer was coupled to a HPLC system<br>
manufactured by Hewlett-Packard (HP110 0) .  The<br>
autosampler for the system was a Gilson 215 (Middleton,<br>
WI) liquid handler.  All of the equipment was<br>
controlled by the MassLynx software package purchased<br>
from Micromass.<br>
Mass spectral analysis was performed by<br>
liquid chromatography-MS to determine purity and<br>
confirm molecular weight simultaneously.  In instances<br><br>
where the sample purity had been determined by other<br>
means, a flow injection analysis (FIA) was used instead<br>
of the full chromatography analysis.  In all cases,<br>
both positive and negative ion spectra were collected.<br>
Mass Spectrum Acquisition Conditions: For all<br>
experiments, the mass spectrometer was configured in<br>
electrospray mode with the cross-flow counter<br>
electrode.  A flow splitter was used to reduce the flow<br>
from the HPLC to 4 0% of the original flow.  The inlet<br>
temperature was set to 14 0 °C and the drying gas flow<br>
was set to maximize signal.  The resolution of the mass<br>
spectrometer was adjusted to 0.65 amu FWHM and data was<br>
collected in centroid mode.  In positive ion mode, the<br>
cone voltage was set to 25V, the capillary voltage was<br>
3.8 kV.  In negative ion mode, the cone voltage was set<br>
to 25 V and the capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV.<br>
In both, positive and negative ion mode, the time to<br>
acquire a full spectrum was Is with a switching time of<br>
0.25 seconds between scans.  The mass range scanned for<br>
molecules with an expected molecular weight of less<br>
than 350 amu was 70-500 m/z while for molecules with a<br>
expected mass of more than 350 amu the mass to charge<br>
ratio scanned was 200-1000 m/z.<br>
Chromatography Conditions: Liquid<br>
chromatography was performed using a YMC AQ C18 column<br>
(150 mm X 3mm with 5 µ m  particle and a 120A pore size) .<br>
For all analysis, MeCN with 0.2 % formic acid was<br>
combined with water with 0.2% formic acid to form the<br>
elution gradient.  The gradient profile consisted of<br>
starting with 15 % MeCN: water and increasing the<br>
amount of MeCN linearly over ten minutes to 90%.  That<br>
concentration was held constant for 2 minutes before<br>
returning to initial conditions.  During the entire<br>
analysis the flow rate was 0.9mL/min.<br><br>
Flow Injection Conditions: A 1:1 mixture of<br>
the water to MeCN (both with 0.2% formic acid added)<br>
was used to acquire the FIA data.  The flow rate was<br>
set to 0.3 ml/min.<br>
-H NMR<br>
All 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a<br>
Bruker Instruments AMX-500 NMR spectrometer in the<br>
solvent given.<br>

Step 4: To a 0.05 mmol portion of resin 4 was added 2<br>
mL of a 2 0% solution of piperidine in DMF.  The<br>
suspension was rotated at room temperature for 5<br>
minutes, and drained. The procedure was repeated over<br>
2 0 minutes.  The resulting resin was washed<br>
successively with DMF (3x5 mL) , CH3OH (5 mL) , and NMP<br>

water was then added to the resin. The mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for one hour, and filtered.<br>
The filtrate was evaporated, and the residue was taken<br>
up in acetonitrile-water and purified by preparative<br>
HPLC to afford compounds 5a-5bd.<br>

mmol). The pH was maintained at 9.5 for 1 hour and the<br>
mixture stirred at room temperature overnight.  The<br>
resulting suspension was filtered and the filtrate<br>
treated with 1N KHSO4 to pH 2 then extracted with ethyl<br>

GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS OF<br>
EMBODIMENT C FORMULA I (SCHEMES XXIII-XXV)<br><br>
Hydrolysis Method A:<br>
A 0.005-50 mmole sample of the alkylhemiacetal was<br>
dissolved in 2.5 N HCl/ CH3CN (10/ 1) and stirred at<br>
room temperature until the reaction was complete. The<br>
resulting aqueous layer was washed with diethyl ether<br>
(2 x 20 mL) and lyophilized to afford the product.<br>
Hydrolysis Method B:<br><br>
A 0.005-50 mmole sample of alkylheraiacetal was taken<br>
into  neat formic acid and stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature. The mixture was triturated with a 3: l<br>
mixture of hexane/diethyl ether to give a precipitate.<br>
The solvent was decanted and the precipitate washed<br>
with diethyl ether to afford the product.<br>
Hydrolysis Method C:<br>
A 0.005-50 mmole sample of the alkylhemiacetal was<br>
dissolved in CH3OH and 20% Pd(OH)2/C and stirred under<br>
H2 until the reaction was complete. The resulting<br>
suspension was filtered and the solution concentrated<br>
in vacuo, then triturated with a 3:1 mixture of<br>
hexane/diethyl ether to give a precipitate.  The<br>
solvent was decanted and the precipitate washed with<br>
diethyl ether to afford the product.<br>
Hydrolysis Method D:<br>
A 0.005-50 mmole sample of the alkylhemiacetal in<br>
CH3CN/ water (1/ 2) was shaken with acidic resin (Dowex<br>
50w x 2, H+ type) until the reaction was complete. The<br>
solution was filtered and the resin washed with<br>
CH3CN/water (1/4). The resulting water layer was washed<br>
with diethyl ether, concentrated to a smaller volume in<br>
vacuo  then lyophilized to afford the product.<br><br><br><br>

ID Vitro  Assays<br>
Enzyme Inhibition<br>
Ki values for test compounds with the various<br>
caspases were obtained by the method of Margolin et al.<br>
(J. Biol. Chem.. 272 pp. 7223-7228 (1997)).  Assays<br>
were performed in 10 mM Tris (Sigma Corp, St Louis MO)<br>
pH 7.5, 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT, Research Organic INC,<br>
Cleveland, OH) and 0.1% CHAPS (Pierce, Rockford ID at<br>
37 °C.  For caspase-3, a solution of 8% glycerol was<br>
added to the assay buffer to improve enzyme stability.<br>
A 65 µL aliquot of the assay buffer and 5 µL  aliquot of<br>
the appropriate dilutions of inhibitor in DMSO where<br>
pipetted into a 96 well plate, treated with 10 µL  of<br>
caspase, then diluted in assay buffer (0.5-40 nM active<br>
protein by active site titration). A control<br><br>
containing DMSO but no compound was included for each<br>
determination.  The plates were then incubated for 15<br>
minutes at 37 °C, before addition of the appropriate<br>
substrate (2 0 µL, final concentration 1-4 X KM, final<br>
assay volume 100 µL) to initiate the reaction.<br>
Reaction rates were measured at 37°C either by-<br>
following the time dependant increase in absorbance at<br>
405 nM (for the pNA substrates) or in fluorescence (Ex<br>
3 90, Em 460) (for the AMC substrates). The rates<br>
obtained were plotted against inhibitor concentration<br>
and the data fit to the Morrison tight-binding equation<br>
for competitive inhibitors (Morrison, J.F., Biochem.<br>
Bionhvs. Acta, 185 pp. 269-286 (1969)). The substrates<br>
used for the individual assays were as follows:<br>
Caspase-1 Suc-YVAD-pNA (Bachem, King of<br>
Prussia, PA) (final concentration in the assay 80 µM) ,<br>
Caspase-3 Ac-DEVD-pNA (Bachem, King of Prussia,<br>
PA) (final concentration in assay, 60 µM)<br>
Caspase-4 Ac-WEHD-AMC (Synpep, Dublin, CA) (final<br>
concentration in Assay 20 µM),<br>
Caspase-7 Ac-DEVD-AMC (Bachem, King of Prussia,<br>

PBMC Cell Assay<br>
IL-1β Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral<br>
Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent<br>
Mononuclear Cells<br>
Processing of pre-IL-1β by ICE can be<br>
measured in cell culture using a variety of  cell<br>
sources. Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors<br>
provides a mixed population of lymphocyte subtypes  and<br>
mononuclear cells that produce a spectrum of<br>
interleukins and cytokines in response to many classes<br>
of physiological  stimulators.  Adherent mononuclear<br>
cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal<br>
monocytes  for selective  studies of cytokine production<br>
by activated cells.<br><br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
An initial dilution series of test compound<br>
in DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent<br>
dilution into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-<br>
glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep)<br>
respectively to yield drugs at 4x the final test<br>
concentration containing 0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol.<br>
The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug<br>
dilutions,  A concentration titration which brackets<br>
the apparent Ki for a test compound determined in an<br>
ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary<br>
compound screen.<br>
Generally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested<br>
and the cellular component of the assay is performed in<br>
duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each<br>
cell culture supernatant.<br>
PBMC isolation and IL-1 Assay:<br>
Buffy coat cells isolated from one pint human<br>
blood (yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus<br>
cells) are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP<br>
separation tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid<br>
with 10 ml of cell suspension. After 15 min<br>
centrifugation at 1500-1800 xg, the plasma/media layer<br>
is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is<br>
collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a<br>
15 ml conical centrifuge tube (Corning).  Media is<br>
added to bring the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the<br>
cells by inversion and centrifuge at 3 00 xg for 15 min.<br>
The PBMC pellet is resuspended in a small volume of<br>
media, the cells are counted and adjusted to 6 x 106<br>
cells/ml.<br><br>
For the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell<br>
suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat<br>
bottom tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test<br>
compound dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-<br>
3012; 20 ng/ml solution prepared in complete RPMI<br>
media; final LPS concentration 5 ng/ml).  The 0.5 ml<br>
additions of test compound and LPS are usually-<br>
sufficient to mix the contents of the wells.  Three<br>
control mixtures are run per experiment, with either<br>
LPS alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional<br>
media to adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml.<br>
The cell cultures are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37 °C<br>
in the presence of 5% CO2.<br>
At the end of the incubation period, cells<br>
are harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical<br>
centrifuge tubes.  After centrifugation for 10 min at<br>
2 00 xg, supernatants are harvested and transferred to<br>
1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.  It may be noted that the cell<br>
pellet may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of<br>
pre-IL-1β and/or mature IL-1β content in cytosol<br>
extracts by Western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-1β<br>
specific antisera.<br>
Isolation of Adherent Mononuclear cells:<br>
PBMC are isolated and prepared as described<br>
above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed<br>
by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour<br>
incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent<br>
cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently<br>
washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final<br>
resuspended in 1.0 ml media.  The enrichment for<br>
adherent cells generally yields 2.5-3.0 x 105 cells per<br>
well.  The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell<br><br>
incubation conditions and processing of  supernatants<br>
proceeds as described above.<br>
ELISA:<br>
Quantikine kits (R&amp;D Systems) may be used for<br>
the measurement of mature IL-1β. Assays are performed<br>
according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-<br>
1β levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent<br>
mononuclear cell positive controls are observed.  ELISA<br>
assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of<br>
supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the<br>
optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.<br>
The inhibitory potency of the compounds can<br>
be represented by an IC50 value, which is the<br>
concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1β<br>
is detected in the supernatant as compared to the<br>
positive controls.<br>
The skilled practitioner realizes that values<br>
obtained in cell assays may depend on multiple factors.<br>
The values may not necessarily represent fine<br>
quantitative results.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Whole Blood Assay for IL-1β Production<br>
Whole blood assay IC50 values for compounds<br>
of this invention were obtained using the method<br>
described below:<br>
Purpose:<br>
The whole blood assay is a simple method for<br>
measuring the production of IL-1β (or other cytokines)<br>
and the activity of potential inhibitors.  The<br>
complexity of this assay system, with its full<br>
complement of lymphoid and inflammatory cell types,<br>
spectrum of plasma proteins and red blood cells is an<br>
ideal in vitro  representation of human in vivo<br>
physiologic conditions.<br>
Materials:<br>
Pyrogen-free syringes (~ 3 0 cc)<br>
Pyrogen-free sterile vacuum tubes containing<br>
lyophilized Na2EDTA (4.5 mg/10 ml tube)<br><br><br>
Human whole blood sample (" 30-50 cc)<br>
1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes<br>
Test compound stock solutions (" 25mM in DMSO or other<br>
solvent)<br>
Endotoxin -free sodium chloride solution (0.9%) and<br>
HBSS<br>
Lipopolysaccharide (Sigma; Cat. # L-3012) stock<br>
solution at 1mg/ml in HBSS<br>
IL-1β ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems; Cat # DLB50)<br>
TNFa ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems; Cat # DTA50)<br>
Water bath or incubator<br>
Whole Blood Assay Experimental Procedure:<br>
Set incubator or water bath at 3 0 °C.<br>
Aliquot 0.25ml of blood into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.<br>
Note:  be sure to invert the whole blood sample tubes<br>
after every two aliquots.  Differences in replicates<br>
may result if the cells sediment and are not uniformly<br>
suspended.  Use of a positive displacement pipette will<br>
also minimize differences between replicate aliquots.<br>
Prepare drug dilutions in sterile pyrogen-<br>
free saline by serial dilution. A dilution series<br>
which brackets the apparent Ki for a test compound<br>
determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used<br>
for the primary compound screen.  For extremely<br>
hydrophobic compounds, prepare compound dilutions in<br>
fresh plasma obtained from the same blood donor or in<br>
PBS-containing 5% DMSO to enhance solubility.<br>
Add 25 µl test compound dilution or vehicle<br>
control and gently mix the sample.  Then add 5.0 µl  LPS<br>
solution (250 ng/ml stocked prepared fresh:  5.0 ng/ml<br>
final concentration LPS), and mix again.  Incubate the<br>
tubes at 30 °C in a water bath for 16-18 hr with<br>
occasional mixing.  Alternatively, the tubes can be<br><br>
placed in a rotator set at 4 rpm for the same<br>
incubation period.  This assay should be set up in<br>
duplicate or triplicate with the following controls:<br>
negative control - no LPS; positive control - no test<br>
inhibitor; vehicle control - the highest concentration<br>
of DMSO or compound solvent used in the experiment.<br>
Additional saline is added to all control tubes to<br>
normalize volumes for both control and experimental<br>
whole blood test samples.<br>
After the incubation period, whole blood<br>
samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at ~ 2000 rpm in<br>
the microfuge, plasma is transferred to a fresh<br>
microfuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 x g to pellet<br>
residual platelets if necessary.  Plasma samples may be<br>
stored frozen at -70 °C prior to assay for cytokine<br>
levels by ELISA.<br>
ELISA:<br>
R&amp;D Systems (614 McKinley Place N.E.<br>
Minneapolis, MN 55413) Quantikine kits may be used for<br>
measurement of IL-1β and TNF-ot.  The assays are<br>
performed according to the manufacturer's directions.<br>
IL-1β levels of ~ 1-5 ng/ml in positive controls among<br>
a range of individuals may be observed. A 1:200<br>
dilution of plasma for all samples is usually<br>
sufficient for experiments for ELISA results to fall on<br>
the linear range of the ELISA standard curves.  It may<br>
be necessary to optimize standard dilutions if you<br>
observe differences in the whole blood assay.  Nerad,<br>

Antiviral Assays<br>
The efficacy of the compounds of this<br>
invention at treating or preventing antiviral related<br>
diseases, disorders, or conditions may be evaluated in<br>
various in vitro  and in vivo  assays. For example,<br>
assays may be preformed to determine the ability of<br>
these compounds to inhibit inflammatory responses<br>
associated with viral infections. In vitro  assays may<br>
employ whole cells or isolated cellular components. In<br>
vivo  assays include animal models for viral diseases.<br><br>
Examples of such animal models include, but are not<br>
limited to, rodent models for HBV or HCV infection, the<br>
Woodchuck model for HBV infection, and chimpanzee model<br>
for HCV infection.<br>
Compounds of this invention may also be<br>
evaluated in animal models for dietary alcohol-induced<br>
disease.<br>
Other assays that may be used to evaluate the<br>
compounds of this invention are disclosed in PCT<br>
application PCT/US96/20843, published June 26, 1997,<br>

in  vivo  pharmacokinetic studies in the mouse,<br>
inhibition of ICE homologs, inhibition of apoptosis, in<br>
vivo  acute assay for anti-inflammatory efficacy,<br>
measurement of blood levels of drugs, IGIF assays,<br>
mouse carrageenan peritoneal inflammation assay, and<br>
type II collagen-induced arthritis.<br>
Insofar as the compounds of this invention<br>
are able to inhibit caspases, particularly ICE, in<br>
vitro  and furthermore, may be delivered orally to<br>
mammals, they are of evident clinical utility for the<br>
treatment of IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, and IFN-γ-<br>
mediated diseases.<br>
