				<td>This invention generally relates, to, an unconventional kind of Atomizer and more particuiariy, the invention relates a unique device known as Improved Automiser. I'he tunction of the device is to automise water to maintain the relative humidity of a humidification plant used m the textile industry, rhe need for maintaimng the relative humidity of a plant arises due to the tact that in the event of varying humidity, results in following problems.<br>
1.	It is a known tact when machines are operated in the plant more heat is generated. Thereby, the heat of the environment increases. Further, the combined effect of heat and humidity results in the decrease of productivity and quality of the processed product.<br>
2.	Apart trom the above point, the use of Improved Automiser according to invention, resuUs in energy saving of the entire industry. In the conventional system the no22les with very small orifice are fixed on the vertical pipes of 10-12 feet height, and the water is pumped up to this vertical pipe through the horizontal pipe, and as such requires high pressure pump with more horse power. The numerous bends of the vertical pipes of 90 degrees, and the small orifice of these nozzles demands more pressure and horse power tor a better spray. Improved Automiser is designed to reduce this extra power and pressure as it is tixed on the horizontal pipes in order to obtain the pressure and power of the pump directly, and by totally avoiding the vertical pipes and bends. The 12mm orifice of the Improved Automiser allows the water to eject quickly and easily in to fine, tiiming mist, fhe limited nos. of Improved Automiser [maximum 8 to 10 nos per plant jalso helps to utilize the pressure and power of the pump etliciently and more effectively.<br>
3.	Multiples Improved Automisers are used in a plant. The number of Improved Automiser for a Plant depends on various parameters such as<br>
i.	area of the plant<br>
ii.        load capacity of the pump motors.<br>
iii.       area to be humidified<br>
It is to be noted, by installation of several Improved Automiser and by using reduced motor capacity, the entire unit can run. Because of utilization of motors of less capacity, there is a resultant energy saving. The basic objective of the invention is to identify the technology and equipments involved, which results in energy saving.<br>
It has been identified that apart from capital plant outlay, and other investments, the area that need attention is to reduce the cost of manufacturing process. It has been identified, the existing plant and machinery consumes enormous electrical power. The company has focused its research and development to reduce the energy consumption wherever it is viable. Ihe results of our R &amp; D is the designing and development of Improved Automiser. fhe basic fiinction of the Improved Automiser is as follows :<br><br>
1.	In the conventional type of humidifying system, plenty of nozzles are being used.<br>
2.	I'he number of conventional nozzles depends on various parameters known in the art.<br>
i	The conventional nozzles has inherent defects In  view of the construction of<br>
the orifice of the nozzles in the conventional humidifying system, their use results in formation of water scales, which results in reduced water output and finally results in chocking of the nozzle. This results in reducing the relative humidity in the unit. Further, the entire purpose of humidifying is lost. This reflects in the quality of the material processed.<br>
That is to say, there is a need tor a continuous movement of material tfom the processing zone to the end zone and there should not be any static charges at any stage in the process.<br>
Ihe maintenance and servicing cost of the conventional nozzles is quite high because of scale formation. There is a need tor people to supervise the nozzle and maintain the nozzle by servicing. The man power requirements is quite high, which depends on the number of conventional nozzles used in the plant. By using the Improved Automiser, accordingly to our invention the cost of maintenance and labour is reduced to an appreciable amount. The humidifying plant down time is thereby reduced. The cumulative effect of various factors as mentioned herein above results in energy saving and utilizing of our invention namely "Improved Automiser" results in better efficiency of the overall industry. It is to be noted, while servicing the conventional nozzles 15% to 20% of the nozzles should be replaced. This happens due to the breakages of the nozzles. Replacement of nozzles results in increased maintenance cost. At the outset, it is very clear that utilisatlonof conventional nozzles results in enormous loss to the industry.<br>
In order to overcome the problem of maintenance of various nozzles and the breakage of nozzles, a solution has been found by Inventing a second generation nozzles incorporating better technology, which results in quantitative reduction of use of nozzles. However, incorporation of second generation nozzles erected problems. In that, the mist formation is not achieved and the very purpose of using this second generation nozzles is lost. Our company made extensive study and otters a solution to overcome the problem.<br>
It is a primary object of invention to invent a new Improved Automiser which is unique.<br>
It is another object of unique to innovate the Improved Automiser wherein the mist tbrmation can be controlled by varying the distance between the tip of the spray cone and orifice of the flange.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent a Improved Automiser which effectively control and humidity level of various departments of an industry.<br><br>
