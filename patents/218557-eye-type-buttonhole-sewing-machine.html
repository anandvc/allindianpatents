				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an eye-type buttonhole sewing machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
DE 198 07 771 C1 (corresponding to US 6 095 066) describes an eye-type button<br>
hole sewing machine with a needle drivable in up and down reciprocation. It<br>
comprises an x-y table which is displaceable by stationary stepper motors<br>
mounted on the sewing machine. The x-y table is supported by way of vertical,<br>
parallel rods so that displacement in the direction is arched. Actuation in the x<br>
direction is effected via a toothed quadrant that is coupled with a shaft with an<br>
oscillating lever mounted thereon. Actuation in the y direction takes place via an<br>
electric motor by means of a threaded spindle which runs in the y direction and<br>
the spindle nut of which is joined to the y carriage by a sliding coupling.<br>
Drawbacks reside in that accurate working of the stitch-forming tools i.e., of the<br>
needle, hook etc., is restricted or, for greater displacements, not at all attainable<br>
due to the fact that the guidance of the table is acceptable only with some<br>
reservations. Further drawbacks reside in that a considerable number of<br>
components is required, having a corresponding mass, which demands for strong<br>
dimensioning of the stepper motors.<br>
Prior public use by Applicant has disclosed an eye-type buttonhole sewing<br>
machine in which an x-y table of the above design is drivable in the y direction<br>
by a belt drive. The oscillating levers which perform the motion in the x direction<br>
are drivable by a cam drive. The design has the additional drawback that the belt<br>
drive possesses a certain elasticity, allowing accurate position only to a certain<br>
extent.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to embody an eye-type buttonhole sewing<br>
machine in which in the x and y direction may take place very easily and<br>
accurately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object is attained by the features of the invention. The design according to<br>
the invention helps accomplish that the x-y table, with a work piece resting<br>
thereon, is guided on an x-y level, nor performing any vertical motion<br>
perpendicular thereto. With the drive which converts the rotary motion into a<br>
linear motion acting directly on the x carriage, components are saved and<br>
actuation virtually free from play is rendered possible. Likewise, the y drive from<br>
play because of direct conversion. Since the drives act directly on the<br>
respectively x and y carriage in the x and y direction, also the mass of conversion<br>
elements is low so that strong acceleration and high positioning accuracy are<br>
attained, accompanied with driving motors of correspondingly restricted design.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, an eye -type buttonhole sewing machine is C-shaped, which<br>
means it has a top arm 1, a bottom base plate 2 in the form of a casing, and a<br>
vertical standard 3 connecting the two. An arm shaft 4 is conventionally run in<br>
the arm 1; it is actuated by a driving motor 5 by means of a belt drive 6.<br>
Actuation of a needle bar 7, which has a needle 8 and is movable vertically in the<br>
z direction, and a jogging drive therefore are conventionally derived from the<br>
arm shaft 4. A hook bearing 9, which is disposed in the base plate 2, is allocated<br>
to the needle bar 7. The needle bar 7 is mounted on a pivot bearing 10, in which<br>
it pivots about its longitudinal axis 11 together with the hook bearing 9 for so-<br>
called eye-type buttonholes to be produced. Pivoted actuation of the pivot<br>
bearing 10 i.e., of the needle bar 7 with needle 8 and the hook bearing 9, is<br>
effected by a joint drive (not shown), of which is illustrated only a timing belt 12<br>
that leads to the pivot bearing 10. The design of the pivot bearing 10 is known<br>
for instance from DE 198 07 771 (corresponding to U.S. patent 6 095 066),<br>
which reference is made to.<br>
An x-y table 13 is disposed on the base plate 2; it is a cross slide movable in two<br>
horizontal coordinate directions, namely the x direction and the y direction. It<br>
comprises a bearing plate 14 with a work piece clamp 15 disposed thereon,<br>
having a clamping plate 17 that is mounted on a pivotable bearing lever 16.<br>
Details of the structure and actuation of such a work piece clamp 15 will become<br>
apparent from DE 102 16 809 A, which reference is made to in this regard.<br>
Located downstream of the needle bar 7 in the y direction is a buttonhole cutting<br>
device 18, which is only roughly outlined in Fig. 1. Structure and operation of<br>
such a buttonhole cutting device are described for example in DE 33 15 521 C2<br>
(corresponding to US 4 552 080). Clamped between the clamping plate 17 and<br>
the bearing plate 14 is a work piece (not shown) which is to be provided with a<br>
buttonhole that will then be cut up by means of the buttonhole cutting device 18.<br>
Design and actuation of the x-y table 13 will be described below. It comprises an<br>
x carriage 19 which is displaceable on the base plate 2, and a y carriage 20 that<br>
is displaceable in the y direction on the x carriage 19. The x carriage 19<br>
comprises two parallel x guide bars 21, 22 which run in the x direction and are<br>
displaceable in two x sliding bearing 23 which are stationary on eth base plate 2.<br>
the two x guide bars 21, 22 are assembled in the vicinity of their free ends by<br>
means of ties 24. They are also joined to y guide bars 25, 26 which run in the x<br>
direction i.e., direction i.e., they are horizontal like the x guide bars 21, 22,<br>
however extending perpendicular thereto. The x guide bars 21, 22 and the y<br>
guide bars 25, 26 combine with the ties 24 to form the x carriage 19 which is<br>
rectangular in a plan view. The x guide bar 22 is disposed in the standard 3.<br>
Y sliding bearings 27 are formed on the bottom side of the bearing plate 14, with<br>
two of them at a time being disposed on each y guide bar 25, 26 so that the<br>
bearing plate 14 combines with the y sliding bearings 27, forming the y carriage<br>
20.<br>
Actuation of the x carriage 19 in the x direction takes place by an x motor 28<br>
which is mounted on the base plate 2 and the driven shaft 29 of which is<br>
drivable in rotation about a vertical axis 30. A cam disk 31 is mounted on the<br>
driven shaft 29, having a cam curve in the form of a guiding groove 32 that<br>
spirals in relation to the axis 30. A driver 33 is clampingly fixed to the y guide bar<br>
26, on its bottom side having a driving roller 34 which engages with the guiding<br>
groove 32. Owing to the arrangement of the guiding groove 32 in relation to the<br>
stationary axis 30 of the x motor 28, the x carriage 19, upon rotary or pivoted<br>
actuation of the cam disk 31 about the axis 30, is moved in the x direction with<br><br>
the maximal length of displacement i.e., the maximal lift of the x carriage 19<br>
being in the range of approximately 8 mm. Consequently, the cam disk the driver<br>
33 from a cam drive 35, which translates the rotary motion of the x motor 28<br>
into a linear motion of the x carriage 19.<br>
The y carriage 20 is driven by a y motor 36 which is disposed in the standard 3<br>
and the driven shaft 37 of which, via a coupling 38, is connected to a threaded<br>
spindle 39 which runs in the y direction. The threaded spindle 39 is rotatably<br>
housed in bearings 40 which are mounted on the base plate 2. A spindle nut 41<br>
is mounted on the threaded spindle 39; it is connected to the y carriage 20 by<br>
means of a sliding coupling 42. To this end, aligned pins 43, 44 are mounted on<br>
the spindle nut 41; they extend in the direction and engage with guide holes 45<br>
of two driving arms 46, 47 which are mounted on the bottom side of the bearing<br>
plate 14. The pins 43, 44 are sufficiently long and the driving arms 46, 47 are<br>
sufficiently long and the driving arms 46, 47 are sufficiently spaced from the<br>
spindle nut 41 for the pins 43 and 44 to be shifted in the respective driving arm<br>
46 and 47 by the maximal length of the displacement s of the x carriage 19 in<br>
the x direction upon corresponding displacements by way of the cam drive 35.<br>
Displacement of the y carriage 20 in the y direction takes place by rotary<br>
actuation of the y motor 36 via the threaded spindle 39 and the spindle nut 41<br>
and the sliding coupling 42. The usual length of displacement in the y direction is<br>
for example 30mm.<br>
The x motor 28 and the y motor 36 are electric motors, preferably stepper<br>
motors with rotary position feedback. In the same way as the driving motor 5,<br>
they are connected via corresponding control lines 48, 49 50 to a control unit 51<br>
where the control data are recorded.<br><br>
