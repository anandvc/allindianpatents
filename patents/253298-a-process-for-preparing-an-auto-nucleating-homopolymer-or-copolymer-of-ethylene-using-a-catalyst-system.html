				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to the field of polyethylene prepared with a catalyst system<br>
based on a tetrahydroindenyl catalyst component and to their solid state properties.<br>
Rotomoulding is used for the manufacture of simple to complex, hollow plastic<br>
products. It can be used to mould a variety of materials such as for example<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Polyethylene<br>
(PE) represents more than 80 % of the polymers used in the rotomoulding market.<br>
This is due to the outstanding resistance of polyethylene to thermal degradation<br>
during processing, to its easy grinding, good flowability, and low temperature impact<br>
properties.<br>
Polyethylenes prepared with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst are generally used in<br>
rotomoulding, but metallocene-produced polyethylenes are desirable, because their<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution allows better impact properties and shorter<br>
cycle time in processing.<br>
Most of the metallocene-prepared polyethylene resins available on the market (see<br>
ANTEC, vol. 1, 2001) are prepared with a catalyst system based on bis(n-butyl-<br>
cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride. They suffer from poor dimensional stability<br>
such as high shrinkage and warpage. They also suffer from creep or permanent<br>
deformation under stress.<br>
Godinho et al. ( in Polymers, Rubbers and Composites, vol 29, n°7, pp 316 ,2000)<br>
have shown that for semi-crystalline polymers such as polyethylene small spherulite<br>
size equivalent to fine microstructure provides improved dimensional stability as well<br>
asother solid state properties such as for example improved impact strength.<br><br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide polyethylene resins having a fine<br>
microstructure that can be tailored according to needs.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide polyethylene resins having<br>
reduced shrinkage.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide polyethylene resins having<br>
reduced warpage.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide polyethylene resisns having high<br>
creep resistance.<br>
It is a yet further aim of the present invention to provide a polyethylene resin having<br>
high impact resistance.<br>
It is yet another aim of the present invention to provide a polyethylene resin having<br>
high stress crack resistance.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide a polyethylene resin having<br>
excellent barrier properties.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a method for preparing a homopolymer<br>
or a copolymer of ethylene that comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	Injecting into the reactor a catalyst system comprising i) a metallocene<br>
catalyst component of general formula I<br><br>
wherein (Ind) is an indenyl or an hydrogenated indenyl, substituted or unsubstituted,<br>
R" is a structural bridge between the two indenyls to impart stereorigidity that<br>
comprises a C1-C4 alkylene radical, a dialkyl germanium or silicon or siloxane, or a<br>
alkyl phosphine or amine radical, which bridge is substituted or unsubstituted; Q is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to20 carbon atoms or a halogen, and M is a<br><br>
transition metal Group 4 of the Periodic Table or Vanadium, ii) an activating agent<br>
and iii) optionally a support;<br>
b)	injecting into the reactor ethylene monomer at a concentration of at least<br>
6.5 wt%,<br>
c)	injecting an amount of hydrogen such that the ratio H2/C2 in the feed is of<br>
less than 85 g/106g;<br>
d)	maintaining under polymerisation conditions at a temperature of less than<br>
90 °C;<br>
e)	retrieving Dolvethylene resin that is suitable fro preparing articles having<br>
excellent solid state and barrier properties.<br>
Each indenyl or hydrogenated indenyl compound may be substituted in the same<br>
way or differently from one another at one or more positions in the cyclopentadienyl<br>
ring, the cyclohexenyl ring and the bridge.<br>
Each substituent on the indenyl may be independently chosen from those of formula<br>
XRV in which X is chosen from.,Group 14 of the Periodic Table, oxygen and nitrogen<br>
and each R is the same or different and chosen from hydrogen or hydrocarbyl of<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and v+1 is the valence of X. X is preferably C. If the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring is substituted, its substituent groups must not be so bulky as to<br>
affect coordination of the olefin monomer to the metal M. Substituents on the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring preferably have R as hydrogen or CH3. More preferably, at<br>
least one and most preferably both cyclopentadienyl rings are unsubstituted.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, both indenyls are unsubstituted, and most<br>
preferably they are unsubstituted hydrogenated indenyls.<br>
The active catalyst system used for polymerising ethylene comprises the above-<br>
described catalyst component and a suitable activating agent having an ionising<br>
action.<br>
Suitable activating agents are well known in the art.<br><br>
Optionally, the catalyst component can be supported on a support.<br>
The polymerisation conditions necessary to obtain the desired polyethylene resin<br>
comprise a high concentration of ethylene, little or no hydrogen and a low<br>
polymerisation temperature. The concentration of ethylene is of at least 6.5 wt%,<br>
preferably of at least 7 wt%. The amount of hydrogen is selected to give a H2/C2 in<br>
the feed of at most 85 g/ 106 g, preferably of at most 60 g/ 106 g, more preferably<br>
there is no hydrogen. The polymerisation temperature is of less than 90 °C,<br>
preferably of less than 88 °C, more preferably of from 80 to 85 °C.<br>
The PE resins prepared with the metallocene catalyst system of the present<br>
invention may be homo- or co-polymers of ethylene with densities ranging from<br>
0.930 to 0.965 g/cc. The density is measured following the method of standard test<br>
ASTM 1505 at a temperature of 23 °C. The melt index is typically of at least 0.5,<br>
preferably of at least 3, as measured following the method of standard test ASTM D<br>
1238 under a load of 2.16 kg and at a temperature of 190 °C. They are<br>
characterised by a narrow molecular weight distribution, typically with a<br>
polydispersity index (D) lower than 3. The polydispersity index is defined as the ratio<br>
Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw to the number average<br>
molecular weight Mn. The long Chain Branching Index (LCBI) is superior to 0,<br>
indicating the presence of long chain branching. It is surprisingly observed that the<br>
long chain branching (LCB) initiates an auto-nucleation process. The magnitude of<br>
this nucleation process increases with increasing long chain branching and LCB<br>
itself can be tailored by modifying the polymerisation conditions. This auto-<br>
nucleation process suppresses or reduces the need for external nucleating agents<br>
for polyethylene resins.<br>
These polyethylene resins can be used to prepare articles Dy all methods generally<br>
used in the field, such as for example rotomoulding, injection moulding, blow<br>
moulding or extrusion. They are particularly advantageous in rotomoulding<br>
applications.<br><br>
The finished articles according to the present invention have several attractive<br>
properties.<br>
- They have a very fine microstructure characterised by an average spherulite<br>
diameter, smaller than those prepared either with Ziegler-Natta (ZN) resins or<br>
resins prepared with other metallocene catalyst systems. The copolymers of<br>
ethylene obtained according to the present invention have a typical spherulite<br>
size of less than 20 µm, preferably of less than 18 µm.<br>
They have excellent properties in the solid state such as<br>
i) mechanical properties,<br>
ii) barrier properties,<br>
iii) dimensional stability.<br>
The barrier properties of articles prepared with the resins according to the invention<br>
are of less than 1 g/day, preferably of less than 0.5 g/day.<br>
These properties will be illustrated by way of examples.<br>

Resin R10 is a resin according to the present invention prepared with a bridged<br>
bis(tetrahydroindenyl)-based catalyst system.<br>
Resin R11 is a homopolymer of ethylene according to the present invention<br>
prepared with a bridged bis(tetrahydroindenyl)-based catalyst system.<br>
Their properties are summarised in Table I.<br><br><br>
* It must be noted that the spherulite size increases with increasing density and that<br>
for the density of 0.960 g/cc of resin R11, the observed spherulite size is extremely<br>
small.<br>
The melt flow index MI2 was measured following the method of standard test ASTM<br>
D 1238, under a load of 2.16 kg and at a temperature of 190 °C. The density was<br>
measured following the method of standard test ASTM D 1505 at a temperature of<br>
23 °C.<br>
The spherulite size is measured by Small Angle Light Scattering (SALS). When a<br>
beam of light passes through a thin slice of a semi-crystalline polymer, which is<br>
positioned between two crossed polarisers, the spherulites of the polymer diffuse the<br>
light and a four-leaf pattern is projected onto a screen positioned after the second<br>
polariser. The size of the pattern is inversely related to the spherulite diameter and<br>
may be used for its determination.<br>
Rigidity analyses were carried out as follows.<br>
The Young modulus was measured on compression-moulded samples following the<br>
method of standard test ASTM D 790 on samples R3 and R6 having an identical<br>
density. The Young modulus of resin R6 was higher than that of prior art resin R3<br>
with values respectively of 575 MPa for resin R3 and of 615 Mpa for resin R6.<br>
Rheological dynamic analysis in torsion mode was carried out on powder samples<br>
for resins R3 and R6, and in tensile mode for resins R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6. The<br>
elastic modulus E' (tensile mode) of resins according to the present invention had a<br>
higher value than that of all prior art resins over the whole range of tested<br>
temperatures.<br>
Dynamic mechanical analysis measurements were carried out on 700 mL<br>
rotomoulded bottles prepared with a Peak Internal Air Temperature (PIAT) of 230<br>
oC. Compression tests were carried out to determine the force necessary to achieve<br><br>
for a 5 mm displacement and the maximum force for several resins. The resins<br>
according to the present invention outperformed all other resins.<br>
Tensile analysis was carried out on rotomoulded tanks using the methods of<br>
standard test ISO R527/ sample type 5, at a temperature of 23 °C and at a<br>
stretching speed of 100 mm/min. Resin R6 had a behaviour similar to or slightly<br>
better than that of the prior art resins for the yield stress, the Young's modulus and<br>
the elongation at break.<br>
The resistance to impact was tested by the falling weight method on rotomoulded<br>
tanks and by the drop test on 10 L rotomoulded bottles having a 6 mm wall<br>
thickness.<br>
The resins according to the present invention were all less brittle than the prior art<br>
resins.<br>
The drop test was carried out at a temperature of -18 °C, on 10 L rotomoulded<br>
bottles having a wall thickness of 6 mm and prepared with a proprietary mould. The<br>
bottles were dropped from increasing heights until failure occurred.<br>
Prior art resin R1 failed at a height of 1.5 m.<br>
Prior art resin R4 failed at a height of 2 m.<br>
Prior art resin R5 failed at a height of 6 m.<br>
Resin R6, according to the present invention did not fail up to a height of 6.5 m both<br>
at a temperature of -18 °C and at a temperature of -40 °C.<br>
All resins were also tested for stacking on 700 mL rotomoulded bottles, prepared<br>
with a proprietary mould, filled with a wetting agent (Huperol at 5% in water) and<br>
placed under a load of 35 kg. The height of the bottles was measured before loading<br>
and then at different time intervals after loading. The results are summarised in<br>
Table II.<br><br><br>
In this table, the term "broken" means that, at least 50% of the tested samples, broke<br>
during the test.<br>
From Table II it appears that the polyethylene resin of the present invention exhibits<br>
an excellent performance in the stacking test.<br>
The stacking test performed at a temperature of 40 °C on 700 mL rotomoulded<br>
bottlesn having a 2.5 mm wall thickness, prepared with resins R7, R8 and R9 with a<br>
proprietary mould, filled with a wetting agent (Huperol at 5% in water) and placed<br>
under a load of 40 kg are displayed in Figure 2 representing the deflection<br>
expressed in cm as a function of time expressed in days.<br>
The stacking test performed at a temperature of 40 °C on 700 mL rotomoulded<br>
bottles having a 1.5 mm wall thickness, prepared with resins R3, R4 and R6 with a<br>
proprietary mould, filled with HNO3 (55%) and placed under a load of 35 kg are<br>
displayed in Figure 3 representing the deflection expressed in cm as a function of<br>
time expressed in days.<br>
The environmental stress crack resistance (bottle ESCR) tests were performed on<br>
700 mL rotomoulded bottles having a 1.5 mm wall thickness, prepared with a<br><br>
proprietary mould and filled, with an Antarox 10% solution. They were submitted to a<br>
force of 6 newtons per cm2 at a temperature of 60 °C. The resin according to the<br>
present invention outperformed all other resins as can be seen in Table III.<br><br>
Creep tests were also carried out. Results for the true longitudinal deformation as a<br>
function of time, for tubes submitted to a traction creep of 16 Mpa at room<br>
temperature are exhibited in figure 4 for resins R8 and R9 and in figure 5 for resins<br>
R3 and R6. They show the improved behaviour of resins R9 and R6 according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Pressure tests were carried out on rotomoulded pipes having a 32 mm diameter and<br>
a 3 mm wall thickness. They were submitted to a pressure of 3.5 Mpa at a<br>
temperature of 80 °C. Prior art resin R3 failed after a period of time of 50 hours as<br>
compared to resin R6 according to the present invention that failed after a period of<br>
time of 400 hours.<br>
Barrier properties were studied on rotomoulded 10 L bottles having a wall thickness<br>
of 6 mm and prepared with a proprietary mould. They were filled with fuel (CEC<br>
RF08-A-85 according to norm Standard ECE34- annex 5) at a temperature of 40 °C.<br>
The results for the permeability to fuel, expressed in g/day, displayed in Table IV<br>
clearly show the outstanding barrier properties of resins R6 and R11.<br><br><br>
It can be seen that the resins according to the present invention clearly outperform<br>
all prior art resins with permeabilities of less than 0.5 g/day.<br>
In addition, and quite contrary to prior art resins, clear correlations were observed<br>
between the long chain branching index LCBI, the spherulite size and the melt index.<br>
This behaviour is summarised respectively in Figures 6 to 8. Figure 6 shows a linear<br>
correlation between the LCBI and the spherulite size. The spherulite size decreased<br>
linearly with increasing LCBI for resins R6, R9 and R10 whereas it remained<br>
unchanged for prior art resins. Figure 7 shows a correlation between LCBI and melt<br>
index MI2 for the resins according to the present invention. The melt index increased<br>
with decreasing LCBI. In the resins of the present invention, the LCB content could<br>
thus be tailored by modifying the melt index. Figure 8 shows a linear correlation<br>
between the melt index and the spherulite size. The melt index increased linearly<br>
with increasing spherulite size.<br>
Impact tests were performed on rotomoulded articles prepared respectively with<br>
resin R6 according to the present invention and resins R3 and R4 usually employed<br>
in the field. The tests were performed following the method of standard test ISO<br>
6603-2, respectively at temperatures of 20 °C, -20 °C and -40 °C and on samples<br>
having a thickness of 4.5 and 6 mm. The results are displayed in Table V.<br><br><br><br>
Resin R6 according to the present invention outperforms the other resins at all<br>
tested temperatures.<br>
The load displacement curves, at a temperature of-40 °C, are presented on Figures<br>
9a, 9b and 9c for the 4.5 mm rotomoulded samples prepared respectively with resins<br>
R6, R3 and R4.<br>
Resin R6 exhibits a pure ductile behaviour at all tested temperatures, contrary to the<br>
other tested resins.<br>
In addition a falling weight impact test was also carried out at a temperature of -20<br>
°C on a 10 litres rotomoulded bottles having a wall thickness of 6 mm and prepared<br>
with resin R11. The bottles all had a completely ductile behaviour and the impact<br>
results are summarised in Table VI.<br><br><br>
All the articles prepared according to the present invention also had outstanding<br>
optical properties.<br>
In conclusion, for all the tests performed, the polyethylene resin according to the<br>
present invention proved at least as good as and in most instances far better than all<br>
the prior art resins.<br>
The same conclusions apply to articles prepared using other methods than<br>
rotomoulding such as for examples extrusion, injection moulding, slush moulding or<br>
thermoforming.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN AUTO-NUCLEATING HOMOPOLYMER<br>
OR COPOLYMER OF ETHYLENE, USING A CATALYST SYSTEM<br>
A process for preparing an auto-nucleating homopolymer or copolymer<br>
of ethylene using a catalyst system is disclosed. The process involves: (a) a<br>
metallocene catalyst component of general formula I<br>
R"(lnd)2MQ2	(I)<br>
wherein (Ind) is an indenyl or an hydrogenated indenyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted, R" is a structural bridge between the two indenyls to impart<br>
stereorigidity that comprises a C1-C4 alkylene raical, a dialkyl germanium or<br>
silicon or siloxane, or a alkyl phosphine or amine radical, which bridge is<br>
substituted or unsubstituted; Q is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 20<br>
carbon atoms or a halogen, and M is a transition metal Group 4 of the Periodic<br>
Table or Vanadium; (b) an activating agent; and (c) optionally support;<br>
wherein the ethylene monomer is maintained in the reactor at a<br>
concentration of at least 6.5 wt% and the amount of hydrogen is such that the<br>
ratio H2/C2 in the feed is of less than 85 g/106g and the polymerisation<br>
temperature is less than 90°C.</td>
