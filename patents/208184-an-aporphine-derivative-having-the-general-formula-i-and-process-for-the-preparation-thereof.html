COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"AN APORPHINE DERIVATIVE HAVING THE GENERAL FORMULA (I) AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
AXON .BIOCHEMICALS   B.V.,   of  Elsschotlaan   32,   Groningen   9721,   WN, Netherlands,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
21-2-2007<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an aporphine derivative having the gc formula (I) and process for the preparation thereof.<br>
This invention relates to new apo:rphine esters, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. More particularly, the present invention relates to new aporphine 10- and 11-mono-esters and 10,11-asymmetric di-estera, their preparation and use and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background art<br>
Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative dis¬order caused by a loss of the eel] bodies of dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons from the substantia nigra and degeneration of nerve terminals in the striatum resulting in low levels of DA in the substantia nigra and corpus striatum. Parkinson's disease is characterized by chronic, progressive motor dys¬function and its main symptoms are tremor at rest, muscle rigidity and a decrease in the frequency of voluntary move¬ments (hypokinesia) with difficulty in stopping, starting and turning when walking. A persistent tremor is superimposed on hypertonicity of opposing muscle groups and initiation of movements becomes increasingly difficult and slow. In ad¬vanced stages, patients' movements become virtually "frozen", and patients are unable to care for themselves. Studies have shown that the symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear when the striatal DA content is reduced to 20-40 % of normal.<br>
As Parkinson's disease is associated with a loss of DA from the striatum, it is commonly treated with drugs which replace DA, the most commonly used of these being levodopa. Levodopa is converted by dopa decarboxylase into DA in the brain and it is this DA which exerts a therapeutic effect. However, although levodopa is well absorbed from the small intestine, much of it is inactivated by monoamine oxidase in the wall of the intestine. Also, the plasma half-life of levodopa is short<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                                     PCT/SE01/01658<br>
and about 95 % of the drug is converted to DA in pripheral tissues, where dopa decarboxylase is widespread, with the result that less than 1 % enters the brain. Consequently le-vodopa has to be administered in large and frequent doses. 5  In addition, the production of DA in peripheral tissues gives rise to unwanted side-effects.<br>
Accordingly, levodopa is normally given in combination with other drugs to enhance the effects of levodopa in the brain<br>
10  and minimize its peripheral effects. In particular, levodopa is usually given in combination with a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, such as carbidopa, which inhibits the breakdown of levodopa to DA outside the brain, thereby reducing peripheral<br>
15  unwanted effects. The inhibitor also ensures that a rela¬tively large amount of an oral dose of levodopa reaches the brain and thus enables the dose of levodopa to be reduced which also reduces peripheral side-effects. In addition, a peripheral DA antagonist, which does not penetrate the blood-<br>
20  brain barrier, such as domperidone, may also be administered to reduce the nausea and vomiting side-effects of levodopa.<br>
    In addition to the side-effects mentioned above, further un¬desirable effects are associated with the prolonged use of<br>
25  levodopa. In particular, many patients develop involuntary choreiform movements, which are the result of excessive acti¬vation of DA receptors. These movements usually affect the face and limbs and can become very severe. Such movements disappear if the dose of levodopa is reduced but this causes<br>
30  rigidity to return. Moreover, the margin between the benefi¬cial and the unwanted effect appears to become progressively narrower as the period of levodopa treatment increases. The traditional method of combating this effect is to increase the frequency of administration of levodopa whilst keeping<br>
35 the overall dose steady. This approach reduces end-of-dose deterioration and diminishes the likelihood of the patient developing the dyskinesias that occur with high peak doses.<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br>
A further complication of long-term levodopa treatment is the development, of rapid fluctuations in clinical state where the patrent .switches suddenly between mobility and immobility for periods ranging'from a few minutes to a few hours. This phe-5  nomenon is, known as the "on-off effect", the "on" state being the'preferred'state during which nearly normal motor func-tioning can be attained ,and the "off" state being character¬ized by dystonic postures during periods of decreased mobil¬ity. Indeed, this effect can produce such an abrupt loss of<br>
10  mobility that the patient may suddenly stop while walking or be unable to rise from a chair in which he had sat down nor¬mally a few moments earlier. This effect is commonly unaf¬fected by manipulation of the dose of levodopa and may re¬quire treatment with alternative drugs. In addition to the<br>
15  above long-term side-effects of levodopa treatment, it has been found that the effectiveness of levodopa gradually de¬clines with time until it is no longer effective. Also, an increased incidence of malignant melanoma has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with levodopa and it has<br>
20  therefore been suggested that treatment with levodopa may be linked with the development of malignant melanoma. Accord¬ingly, the use of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is far from ideal.<br>
25  An alternative approach to the treatment of Parkinson's dis¬ease is the use of drugs that mimic the action of DA. Such drugs are collectively known as DA agonists because they di¬rectly stimulate DA receptors within the DA-deficient nigro-striatal pathway. Unlike levodopa, DA agonists do not need to<br>
30  be converted !in the brain to active compounds. Also, DA ago¬nists are effective in patients in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease when levodopa is no  longer effective be¬cause they act directly on the DA receptors and are therefore unaffected by the lack of DA-producing nerve cells in such<br>
35  patients. However, the action of such DA agonists on the DA receptors also causes unwanted DA-ergic effects, such as nau¬sea, vomiting and extrapyramidal effects, which can be de¬bilitating and some DA agonists, such as apomorphine, are<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                             PCT/SE01/01658<br>
associated with further undesirable side-effects, especially when high doses are used, such as sedation, respiratory de¬pression, hypotension, bradycardia, sweating and yawning. The severity and nature of such side-effects can be affected by 5  the mode of administration of the drug. For instance, studies involving apomorphine have investigated a variety of routes for administration of this drug. However, oral administration of apomorphine tablets has required high doses to achieve the necessary therapeutic effect, because apomorphine adminis-<br>
10  tered by this route undergoes extensive presystemic metabo¬lism in the small intestine and/or liver (the first pass ef¬fect) . Also, long-term studies involving such oral forms were stopped after 7-10 days due to unexplained rises in blood urea nitrogen. Sub-lingual administration of apomorphine tab-<br>
15  lets caused severe stomatitis on prolonged use with buccal mucosal ulceration in half the patients treated. Intranasal administration produced transient nasal blockage, burning sensation and swollen nose and lips and, in some of the pa¬tients tested, had to be withdrawn because of what was con-<br>
20  sidered to be chemical inflammation of the nasal mucosa.1<br>
Accordingly, the only satisfactory way of administering apo¬morphine, which avoids high first pass metabolism, has been found to be subcutaneous administration and, thus, the only<br>
25 commercially available formulation of apomorphine is a liquid for subcutaneous injection or subcutaneous infusion. Even so, subcutaneous administration does not avoid the normal DA ago¬nist side-effects, such as nausea and vomiting and subcutane¬ous administration, whether by injection or infusion, is not<br>
30  easy to accomplish, particularly by patients whose motor<br>
functions are already impaired, and therefore requires train¬ing of patients and caretakers. Also, the injection site must be changed every 12 hours to minimize risks of skin discol¬oration and nodules forming. In view of these problems, it is<br>
35  not surprising that the use of DA agonists, such as apomor¬phine, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been largely confined to the treatment of "off" periods caused by<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                               PCT/SE01/01658<br>
levodopa therapy despite the obvious clinical benefits of such drugs over levodopa.<br>
It is apparent from the above that it would be highly desir-5  able from a clinical point of view to find a way of adminis¬tering DA agonists, such as apomorphine, which is easy for the patient to accomplish, therefore, reducing the need for supervision of administration and which bypasses first pass metabolism in the liver. In addition, such a formulation of 10  apomorphine or of apomorphine prodrugs should have a more<br>
beneficial pharmacokinetic profile than apomorphine itself.2"5<br>
Aporphine pro-drugs have been described and tested in animal models in the past.6'21 Such pro-drugs have been mostly ester<br>
15 .pro-drugs and di-symmetric, i.e. 10,11-di-esters. Thus, for instance, the following di-esters of aporphines have been described: di-acetyl, di-propionyl, dibutyryl, di-iso-butyryl, di-pivaloyl, di-pentanoyl, di-hexanoyl, di-hexadecanoyl, di-phenylacetyl, di-methoxyacetyl, di-trifluoroacetyl and di-<br>
20  heptafluorobutanoyl esters. Some reports of improved bio¬availability of such esters have been presented, but the overall result was disappointing. As an example, the di-pivaloyl ester pro-drug was much less active than the parent compound apomorphine itself. Due to the steric character of<br>
25  the pivaloyl group, it may be speculated that the ester hy¬drolysis of such a bulky group may be slower than for e.g. an acetyl group. 10,11-Di-acetyl-apomorphine is almost as potent as apomorphine itself.6<br>
30  The possibility of preparing asymmetrical di-esters have been mentioned in US-A-4080456.l Such asymmetrical di-esters were, however, not disclosed by means of specific working examples illustrating their preparation and characteristics and it was conceived by the inventors of that publication<br>
35  that such asymmetrical di-esters are difficult to make and that the pharmacology of such di-esters may be difficult to predict. Thus, all known di-acyl-aporphines actually prepared in practice are symmetrically substituted, i.e. the same sub-<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br>
stituent is found on both the 10- and the 11-position of the aporphine skeleton. This is, of course, limiting with respect to optimalLzation of the physicochemical properties that are likely to be of importance for both transdermal and subcuta-5  neous or intramuscular administration.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new apor-10  phine esters having an improved bioavailability as compared to previously know aporphine esters.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide new aporphine esters which have properties suitable for formula-15  tions for the administration via the transdermal, subcutaneous and intramuscular Routes in order to achieve a longer duration of action against Parkinson's disease and other diseases.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to provide trans-20  dermal and/or injectable formulations of aporphine pro-drugs by which the interval between the administrations can be in¬creased considerably.<br>
According to the present invention it was surprisingly found 25 that aporphine mono- and asymmetrical di-esters have properties suitable for formulations for the administration via the trans¬dermal, subcutaneous and the intramuscular route in order to achieve a longer duration of action of the therapeutic effect.<br>
30  Thus, according to said finding, in one aspect the present<br>
invention provides a new aporphine derivative having the gen¬eral formula (I).<br><br>

In a first modification of the method for the preparation of an aporphine di-ester derivative having the general formula (I") as defined above a mono-eater of the general formula (I') , wherein R1  and R2  are as defined in connection with said for-5  mula except that neither thereof is acetyl, is reacted with acetyl chloride in a step a) in the molar ratio of aporphine mono-ester to acetyl chloride of from 1:1 to 1:5 and trifluo-roacetic acid and methylene chloride (CH2-Cl2) , whereafter steps b) to d) aa above follows.<br>

In another modification of the method for the preparation of an aporphine di-ester derivative having the general formula (I") aa defined above a mono-ester of the general formula (I') , wherein R1 and R'2 are as defined in connection with<br>
15  said formula except that neither thereof is acetyl, is re¬acted in a step a) with acetic acid anhydride in CH2C13 in the presence of a basic catalyst such as triethylamine or pyridine whereafter steps b) to d) as above follows.<br>
20  Alternatively, an aporphine mono-acetyl ester is reacted with the anhydride of an acid of the formula (V)<br>
Rs-OH wherein Rs is as defined above, in a step a) in CH2C12 in the presence of a basic catalyst such as triethylamine or pyri-<br>
25  dine whereafter steps b) to d) as above follows.<br>
Aporphines, being catechols, are very sensitive to oxidation (e.g. in atmospheric air) . This is especially true under ba¬sic conditions (a basic solution of apomorphine turns green 30  to blue to violet to black in air) . It is thus virtually im¬possible to handle Such aporphines in the free base form, without the addition of antioxidants.<br>
In addition, the pro-drugs of the present invention are de-35  signed to be easily hydrolyzed, making it difficult to use Si02 and nucleophilic alcohols for purification of the apor¬phine esters of the invention via column chromatography.<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br>
In step a) of the processes according to the present inven¬tion the esterification of the aporphines and the mono-acetyl ester of aporphines, respectively, is performed under acidic conditions in trifluoracetic acid (CF3COOH) diluted with 5  methylene chloride (CH2C12), a suitable dilution ratio being about 3-10 times. The acid chloride, possibly dissolved in CH2-Cl2, is added to the aporphine or aporphine mono-acetyl ester, respectively, at a molar ratio between aporphine or aporphine mono-ester to acid chloride of from 1:1 to 1:5. The 10  optimal ratio will vary depending on the steric properties of the acid chloride but will generally be within the range of from 1:1 to 1:2.<br>
The reaction can be monitored by means of TLC (Al203 and 15  eluting with CH2C12 or CH2Cl2: t -BuOH mixtures or CH2Cl2:EtOH mixtures).<br>
After the reaction has become complete (generally within 1-24 h, depending on the acid chloride and molar ratio used) the 20  solvents are evaporated from the reaction mixture or the re¬action mixture is lyophilized in step b) of the processes of the invention. Evaporation of the solvents is generally car¬ried out under reduced pressure.<br>
25  For purification according to step c) of the processes of<br>
the present invention the residual crude product mixture from step b) is, in step c) dissolved in CH2Cla and purified by chromatography on A1203, elution being carried out by using first CH2-Cl2 and then with mixtures of t-BuOH and CH2C12 in a<br>
30  stepwise gradient of increasing concentration of t-BuOH of<br>
from 1 to 15 % by volume of t-BuOH calculated on the mixture, preferably from 2 to 10 % by volume, for instance in steps of 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 %. During the elution fractions contain¬ing the desired isomeric ester derivatives are collected. In<br>
35  case of the preparation of mono-esters, starting from an<br>
aporphine, potentially formed di-symmetric esters, will elute first and the mono-ester isomers (10-ester, 11-OH and lo-OH, 11-ester) thereafter. Unreacted aporphine (which is a cate-<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                         PCT/SEO1/01658<br><br>
chol) will stick to the column. The isomeric mono-esters may-then be separated using known techniques such as flash chro¬matography, preparative HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chroma¬tography) , crystallization and other methods known per se. 5  However, some of the isomeric mono-esters may prove difficult to separate and in such a case the mixture of the two isomers may be used as the starting material for the preparation of asymmetric di-esters or as the active principle in a pharma¬ceutical preparation. 10<br>
In case of the preparation of the asymmetric di-esters, starting from an individual mono-ester isomer, the asymmetric di-esters will elute first and unreacted mono-esters thereafter.<br>
15  Also in this case, when starting from a mixture of the two<br>
possible isomers of the mono-ester resulting from the esteri-fication process of the present invention, the two di-ester isomers may prove difficult to separate and so it may appear advantageous to use the mixture of isomers as the active<br>
20  principle in a pharmaceutical preparation rather than taking the cost for the separation of the isomers.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an 25  active principle, at least one aporphine derivative of for¬mula I as defined above or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
30  The term nat least one" as used in the paragraph next above is primarily meant to refer to the case when the mixture of two isomers resulting from the esterification process of "the present invention is difficult to separate and hence it might appear advantageous to use said mixture rather than a single<br>
35  isomer. It might also appear advantageous to use the mixture of the two isomers or a combination of two compounds according to the invention having different combinations of the meanings of the symbols R1 and R2 in formula I between each other.<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                PCT/SE01/01658<br>
The aporphine ester pro-drugs of formula I according to the invention may be incorporated in the pharmaceutical composi¬tion according to the invention as the base or as an acid addition salt, especially the hydrochloride salt. Other suit-5  able salts are those formed by the acids HBr and sulphonic acids like methanesulphonic acid, octanesulphonic acid and hexadecansulphonic acid.<br>
From the discussion in the section Background art it is ap-<br>
10  parent that there is a need for improved ways of administra¬tion for apomorphine and/or apomorphine pro-drugs, which are not well absorbed orally and/or are targets for extensive first pass elimination. According to the present invention it was surprisingly found that a dosage form with a prolonged<br>
15  duration of action can be achieved by using aporphine pro¬drugs of formula I according to the invention suspended (as a neat oil or as crystals, or dissolved in a suitable and pharmaceutically acceptable solvent (e.g. water, ethanol, DMSO, i-PrOH or benzylbenzoate) &gt; in a pharmaceutically ac-<br>
20  ceptable depot oil (e.g. viscoleo, sesame oil or olive oil) and injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly with a syringe or a "pen injector". Alternatively, these drugs may, in a suitable composition and with a suitable vehicle (penetration enhancer), be applied to a patch for transdermal administra-<br>
25  tion. The composition could include also a local anesthetic (e.g. lidocaine) to avoid injection pain, in particular at intramuscular injections.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the pharmaceuti-30  cal composition of the present invention said composition is in the form of a patch or an ointment for transdermal admini¬stration. Said patch or ointment preferably also comprises stabilizers, solubilizers and permeation activators to facili¬tate the passage of the active principle through the skin. 35<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the composition according to the present invention said composition is in the form of a depot preparation for subcutaneous or intramuscular<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br><br>
administration comprising said aporphine derivative of for¬mula I or the physiologically acceptable salt thereof dis¬solved or suspended in an oil  As indicated above such a com position preferably, in addition to the aporphine derivative 5  of formula I or the physiologically acceptable salt thereof, contains a local anesthetic.<br>
An injectable depot formulation is a dosage form, which is generally intended to have a therapeutic activity for 2 to 4 10  weeks after administration (e.g. neuroleptics like Fluphen-azine decanoate in sesame oil) . In order to maintain effec¬tive drug plasma levels the dosage form should release the drug at a more or less constant rate during the desired dos¬ing interval. The actual working principle to obtain this<br>
15  prolonged drug release is rather simple. Since the drug sub¬stance has to reach the systemic circulation to display its effect, most depot injection systems decrease the transport rate of the drug from the site of injection to the circula¬tion. The subcutaneous route of administration avoids the<br>
20  problem of the first pass effect, which is very crucial in the case of Apomorphine, which is a catechol and is thus sensitive for oxidation, conjugation and COMT inactivation. Apomorphine can not be given orally due to extensive first pass metabolization.<br>
25<br>
A suitable form of depot preparation is  the  subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of  an oil  solution and/or oil suspension of  a lipophilic drug.   This gives  a'slow transport over the oil-biofluid interface  and a slow dissolution in the<br>
30     biophase.  Thus,   when the drug is dissolved in an apolar solvent (e.g.  oils) ,  which is non-miscible with the aqueous biological fluids,   the drug has to be transported over the oil/water inter¬face.   When the oil/water partition coefficient  is high,   the transport will be  slow.   For very lipophilic drugs,   the re-<br>
35     lease from the oil phase may last  for up to  several weeks.<br>
The maximum volume of  an oil  solution/suspension to be  in¬jected intramuscularly or subcutaneously is  2-4  mL.   This  is<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br><br>
feasible for the preparations of the aporphine derivatives of the present invention. The accumulated daily dose used in apomorphine s.c. therapy in Parkinson's disease is 4-10 times about 1-4 mg (4-4 0 mg/day). For the animal experiments per-5  formed in the pharmacological research, which led to the pre¬sent invention, ca 2 mg Apomorphine x HC1 (or equivalent molar amount of compounds according to Formula I above, as the base or as a suitable salt or ion-pair) was dissolved in 1 mL of an oil (sesame oil, Viscoleo or another approved oil) and the<br>
10  mixture was gently heated (max 50°C) , shaken in a test tube shaker and ultrasonicated for a short time (minutes) until the mixture became a homogeneous solution or suspension. If necessary, the test compound was first dissolved in 50-300 uL DMSO, water, t-BuOH, PEG, benzylbenzoate, or another suitable<br>
15  and approved solvent or mixtures thereof, before adding the oil (see above) to a total volume of 1 mL.<br>
Other suitable administration forms for the aporphine deriva¬tives of formula I according to the invention include forms 20  suited for oral, sublingual, pulmonary, rectal, vaginal or intraduodenal administration.<br>
A preferred form of a pharmaceutical composition intended for oral administration is one which is provided with an enteric 25  coating which is quickly dissolved in the duodenum/small in¬testine.<br>
Such a form may comprise a tablet core prepared by compress¬ing a mixture of active ingredient(s) , excipients, adjuvants 30  and possible other additives which core is then provided with an enteric coating.<br>
Alternatively such a form may comprise a mixture of active ingredient(s) and appropriate excipients and adjuvants en-35  closed in a capsule dissolving in duodenum/small testine and thus functioning as an enteric coating for said mixture. Preferably said mixture is in the form of a solution of the active ingredient(s) in a solvent.<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SEO1/01658<br>
It is preferred that the new aporphine ester pro-drugs of formula I according to the present invention are present in the composition in an amount from 0.05 to 100 mg, preferably 0.05 to 20 mg in each dosage unit. Where a high daily dose is 5  required, this may be administered in several (lower dose) injections over the day. However, this still means fewer in¬jections per day than with the presently used formulation with apomorphine x HCl in water (can reach 10-12 injections per day). 10<br>
As mentioned above in the section Background art, DA agonists like apomorphine produce side-effects such as nausea and vom¬iting. It is therefore preferred that the composition of the invention is administered after, or in conjunction with, an 15  anti-emetic, at lesast at the start of the therapy. The anti¬emetic may be conveniently administered in the same composi¬tion as the new aporphine ester pro-drugs of the present in¬vention. Alternatively, the anti-emetic may be administered separately from the DA agonist by any of the usual oral or 20  parenteral routes of administration, for instance, by tab¬lets, capsules, suspensions, suppositories, infusions, injec¬tions, etc., at a suitable time which may be before, after or simultaneously with administration of the DA agonist. It is likely that, after an adaptation period, the anti-emetic may 25  be taken away from the therapeutic scheme.<br>
Thus according to a further preferred embodiment of the phar¬maceutical composition according to the present invention, said composition, in addition to the aporphine derivative of 30  formula I or the physiologically acceptable salt thereof con¬tains an effective amount of an anti-emetic agent.<br>
It is preferred that the anti-emetic is present in the compo¬sition in an amount of from 1 to 120 mg, more preferably 1-60 35 mg. However, the precise quantity of anti-emetic to be admin¬istered to the patient will depend on the anti-emetic that is selected. A well-known and much used anti-emetic is the pe¬ripheral DA antacrofcist-s 5-chloro-l-[1- [3- [2,3-dihydro~2-oxo-<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br>
IH-benzira±dazol~l-yi)propyll-4-piperidinyll-l,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-Qne (doraperidone) and salts thereof. Preferred daily dose range for the anti-emetic domperidone is 20-120 mg, more preferably 3 0-60 mg. Where a high daily dose is re-5  quired, this may be administered in several units of smaller dose. Another anti-emetic is Naloxone, an apomorphine anti¬dote for apomorphine's emetic effect.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are 10  prepared utilizing a compound of formula I of the invention or a pharmaceuticaly acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concen¬tration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound can be dis-15  solved for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anaesthetic preservatives and buffer¬ing agents are dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the sta¬bility, the composition can be frozen after filling into the 20  vial and the wat§r removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspen¬sions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of be¬ing dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. Possibly, a surfactant or wetting agent is in-25  eluded in the composition to facilitate a uniform distribu¬tion of the compound.<br>
The composition may contain from 0.1 % to 99 % by weight, preferably from 1o to 60 % by weight, of the active material, 30  depending on the method of administration.<br>
The dose of the Compound used in the treatment of the afore¬mentioned disorders will vary in the usual way with the seri¬ousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and 35  other similar factors. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be 0.05 to 100 mg, more suitably 0.05 to 20.0 mg, for example 0.2 to 5 mg; and such unit doses may be ad¬ministered more than once a day; for example two or three<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                            PCT/SE01/01658<br>
times a day, so that the total daily dosage is in the range of about 0.5 to 100 mg; and such therapy may extend for a number of weeks, months, years, including the rest of the patient's life. 5<br>
Other diseases/conditions, beside Parkinson's disease, which can be treated with aporphine pro-drugs of the present inven¬tion and in the formulation of the present invention are restless legs syndrome (RLS), hemicrania, erectile dysfunc-<br>
10  tion (impotence in men) and also sexual stimulation in e.g. menopausal women (stimulation of vaginal lubrication and erection of clitoris), hyperprolactemia and psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia). The herewith mentioned diseases do not form a limitation to the present invention, thus, other diseased<br>
15  states involving the DA-ergic system may also be relevant for treatment with compounds of the present invention.<br>
When administered in accordance with the invention, no unac¬ceptable toxicological effects are expected with the com-20  pounds of the invention.<br>
DA agonists, especially apomorphine, can be used to predict the likely response to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, the present invention in a further aspect 25  thereof provides the use of a pharmaceutical composition as defined above for use in the evaluation of Parkinson's disease.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an aporphine derivative of formula I as<br>
30  defined above for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, hemicrania, restless legs syndrome (RLS), sexual dysfunction in men and women, hyper¬prolactemia and psychotic disorders, and/or evaluation of Parkinson's disease.<br>

Elution was performed 5  with first CH2Cl2 and then with CH2Cl2BtOH (9:1). The isolated product (fraction 17, 5 mg) was dissolved in Viscoleo and one normal rat in a dose of 10 mg/kg (corresponds to ca 5 mg/kg ApoxHCl) s.c. in the neck. Clear signs of dopaminergic activ¬ity for a very long time (ca 24 h).<br>

It was believed that the initial reaction was incomplete and therefore another 3 eqv. were added. It looked as if this brought the reaction to completion. After chromatography (see above) the isolated product (15 mg) was dissolved in Viscoleo<br>
15  and sc injected into two rats (ca 3.7 mg/kg; corr. to 2 mg/kg of ApoxHCl) in a concentration of 3. 7 mg/mL. No effect what¬soever was found.<br>
Explanation: The first small batch contained both mono- and<br>
20  di-C16-Apo and obviously displayed activity when injected in Viscoleo. The second batch contained only di-C16-Apo, which is obviously not (or very slowly) hydrolyzing in vivo com¬pletely to Apo itself. Therefore, a new batch was started and the reaction controlled by API Ms.<br>
25<br>
Synthesis 2: The same reaction was set up, thus a 50 mg batch. This time 1 eqv. was added and the reaction was checked and found incomplete. However, no di-C16 had yet formed. Thus, another eqv. was added and API Ms showed ca 60 %, 100 % and<br>
30  10 % of Apo, mono-C16-Apo and di-C16-Apo, respectively. It was decided the reaction was stopped at this stage and the solvent (CF3COOH) was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in ca 1 mL CH2C12 and put on a pipette Al203 column and eluted with CH2C12 and then CH2Cl2:EtOH (9:1) . Fractions 28-31 were<br>
35  analyzed with API Ms and were shown to contain ca 50/50 of Apo and mono-C16-Apo, despite the fact that the Apo put on the column should be held tightly by Als03! Therefore, to fractions 28-31 was added one drop of pyridine and thereafter<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                                 PCT/SE01/01658<br>
one drop of Ac20 for acetylation of any free OH group in the fractions. Very surprisingly, no di-Ac-Apo was found in the API Ms samples! Thus, no Apo is present in these samples af¬ter chromatography. Apo must have been formed in the samples 5  diluted with MeOH in preparation for the API Ms runs. Mono-CIS -Apo is thus very sensitive to methanolysis (and probably to hydrolysis) and should not come in contact with nucleo-philic alcohols like MeOH and EtOH! However, a non-nucleophilic alcohol like t-BuOH should be OKI<br>
10<br>
The rest of the batch was put onto a Al203 (ca 5 g) column and eluted with CH2Cl2 and then CH2CL2: EtOAc in increasing EtOAc con¬centrations. However, no distinct fractions containing the prod¬uct were seen. Thus, a mixture of CH2Cl2:t-BuOH (9:1) was applied<br>
15 and a spot was observed in fractions 53 and 54, which were pooled leaving only 4.5 mg of a fluorescent product, which was confirmed on API Ms to be mono-hexadecanoyl apomorphine.<br>

Asymmetric di-esters of apomorphine were prepared in a two-5  step process using in each step a methodology analogous to that of Examples 1 to 18.<br>
In the first step 15 mM apomorphine was reacted with acetyl chloride in TFA to give a mixture of the 10,11-isomeric mono-10  acetyl apomorphines. In the second step, in each example an acid chloride as set forth in Table 2, below, was added. Table 2 also gives analysis data for the products thus prepared.<br><br>

was removed and the temperature wag allowed to reach room temperature and the reaction was allowed to stir over night. The volatiles were removed on the rotavapor under reduced pressure and the remaining oil was dissolved in CH2Cl2:EtOH 5  (20:1) and was applied to a Al203 (neutral) column (10-15 g) and was eluted with CH2Cl2:EtOH (2 0:1) and the pure fractions containing the mono-pivaloylated APO were collected (35 mg after evaporation of the solvents) and the mono-Piv-APO (10-Piv-APO or 11-Piv-APO) was documented with NMR (300 MHz) and 10  MS (API, see Table 1).<br>
The collected product (35 mg) was dissolved in ca 0.5 mL CF3COOH and acetylchloride (ca 2 eqv. of the starting amount APOxHCl (i.e. 165x2=330 umol = 2x12.9 = 25.8 fih)   was added<br>
15  at room temperature. The volatiles were evaporated and the remaining oil was dissolved in CH2C12 and was applied to a Al203 (neutral) column and the products were eluted with first CH2C12 and then with CH2Cl2:EtOH (20:1). The fractions containing the two isomers of piv,Ac-APO were taken to NMR<br>
20  (fraction 45) and to biological testing (fraction 46; 6.5 mg and fraction 47; 1.5 mg). GC/MS was documented for fractions 45-4 7 and gave the following relationships between the iso¬mers: fraction 45 first peak/second peak = 75/25; fraction 46: 67/33 and fraction 47: 83/17, respectively.<br>
25<br>
Exempel 25<br>
ApomorphinexHCl (50 mg, 165 /uol) was dissolved in ca 0.5 mL CF3C0OH and propionylchloride (4 eqv., 660 umol, 3x15.2 mg or<br>
30  uL = 45.6/1.4 uL  = 32.6 fih)   was added at room temperature. TLC on Al203 in CH2C12 and CH2Cl2/EtOH (20:1) shows that there is probably too much propionyl chloride added (major product was di-propionyl). Despite this fact, 2 eqv. of acetyl chlo¬ride were added, without first separating, to convert unre-<br>
35  acted propionyl-apo to acetyl,propionyl-apo.<br>
After a night in room temperature, the volatiles were evapo¬rated and the remaining oil was dissolved in CH2C12 and was<br><br>

 applied to an A1203 (neutral) column and the products were eluted with first CHaCl2 and then with CH2Cl2EtOH (20:1). The fractions containing the two isomers of propionyl,Ac-APO and the di-propionyl-Apo were taken to NMR and to biological<br>
5  testing. These fractions contained ca 95 % of the di-propionyl-Apo and ca 5 % of the mixed isomers propionyl, Ac-Apo. GC/MS was documented and showed two small peaks for the disymmetric isomers and a big peak for the di-propionyl-Apo.<br>

Preparation of a depot dosage form of aporphine esters of the present invention in oil.<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SEO1/01658<br>
10<br>
15<br>
 An aporphine eater of the present invention, as the free base or as the salt, is ideally directly dissolved in a pharmaceu-tically accepted oil (see below) or first dissolved or sus¬pended in a suitable solvent like an alcohol (e.g. t-BuOH) or in DMSO, PEG etc., and this solution is, thereafter, dissolved or suspended in a suitable oil (e.g. sesame oil, Viscoleo, olive oil, walnut oil). An antioxidant may also be included in order to protect the formulation from oxidative degrada¬tion. After appropriate sterilization (autocalve, gamma-irradiation, ethylene oxide, sterile filtration etc.), the solution (mixture, suspension) is stored in the freezer until use. Before use, the solution should aquire room temperature and then be shaken vigorously before injecting the solution or suspension subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m.).<br>
Due to the potential nausea and ernesis induced by apomor-phine, naive subjects may be pre-treated with an anti-emetic like domperidone. After a periode of treatment, such domperi-done therapy is likely to be redundant due to the patients' adaptation to apomorphine.<br>
Preferably, each portion or designated unit dosage form con¬tains from 0.5 to 20 mg or aporphine esters of the present invention (or an equivalent amount of the salt/ion-pair), 25  more preferably from 0.5 to 15 mg and especially 1 mg.<br>

The solvent your was ultra filtered (UP). 10<br>
Animals<br>
The test animals used were male albino Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 370 g. Food and water were available to the<br>
15  rats all the time. They were set in a normal 12 hour day night rhythm. Before the operation the animals resided in a larger cage with a group of rats. During the experiments they were alone in a cage with the dimensions 25 * 25 * 35 cm. The blood sampling was performed in freely moving animals, which were all<br>
20  conscious. In this way potential behavioral changes from the treatment could be registered. The operation consisted of the application of a cannula in the vena jugularis. After an ex¬periment the rats were given at least 24 hours to recover.<br>
25  Sampling and extraction of blood<br>
Through a jugularis cannula, blood was taken from the freely moving rats. This took place with an injection syringe and a PE-tubing with the diameter of 0.75 mm. 30<br>
1.	the sampling times were: t = 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720 and 1440 minutes.<br>
2.	in Eppendorf test tubes, 10 uL  of 0.35 % mercapto ethanol and 10 uL of 10% EDTA was spiked (final concentration mer-<br>
35  capto ethanol is 0.01 %).<br>
3.	0.35 mL of blood was collected in the Eppendorf test tubes<br>
(see under 2 above).<br><br>
WO 02/14279                                                                        PCT/SE01/01658<br>
4.	the blood collected was centrifuged for five minutes at 22°C and 350 0 rounds per minute.<br>
5.	200 uL  of plasma was pipetted off and transsferred into clean test tubes.<br>
5  6. these test tubes were stored at minus 18°C until a analyzed.<br>
Extraction of plasma<br>
To the plasma was added a solution containing 500 ng/mL NPA 10  (N-Propyl-norapomorphine). NPA is the internal standard with a final concentration of 50 ng/mL. Additionally, on 100 uL  of a 1 % solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHC03) was added.<br>
1.	3 ml of diethylether (P.A. quality) was added with a glass<br>
15  pipette.<br>
2.	all test tubes where shaken for  three minutes  on a Mul-<br>
tivortex shaker.<br>
3 . the test tubes were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4°C and 1000 rounds per minute. 20  4. the ether layer was pipetted off and brought to another test tube.<br>
5.	ether extraction was performed three times.<br>
6.	the ether layers (9 mL in total) was evaporated with warm water and nitrogen gas flowing over the surface.<br>
25  7. the remains in the test tubes, after the evaporation of the ether, were dissolved in 100 uL  of the mobile phase.<br>
8.	the samples were vortexed and then put in to the centri-<br>
fuge.<br>
9.	the samples prepared were subjected to analysis on the<br>
30  HPLC system.<br>
Transdermal experiment in one single rat<br>
About 5 mg of apomorphine mono-Bu ester prepared according to 35  Example 2 was dissolved in about 120 mg of Fenuril hand cream (PNU). This amount of cream was applied with a spatula on the shaved neck of the rat, weighing about 350 g. Dopaminergic effects were seen but they were weak in their appearance.<br><br>
WO 02/14279	PCT/SE01/01658<br><br>
These effects were monitored for about one hour and consisted in exploratory behavior and grooming and chewing in the be¬ginning phase. After about half an hour the rats became se¬dated and was mostly sitting still with intermittent sniffing 5  and chewing and some yawning.<br>
After one hour and 10 minutes, about five droplets of DMSO were smeared on to the rat neck. After about 10 minutes,- in¬tense jawning, sniffing, penile licking and chewing was reg-<br>
10  istered. About 3 0 minutes after DMSO, the rat became very active with sniffing chewing and licking and displayed a typical dopaminergic syndrome including locomotor activity. The stereotypy lasted for at least two hours. After another two hours (in total 4 hours), the rat was sitting still in an<br>
15  awkward position, sitting rather high on its four legs. Thus, the rat was not in the normal lying position and was easily activated by turning the cage. Chewing sniffing and yawning were still observed at this time (t = ca 6 h).<br>
20  The next day at 10:00 a.m. the rat was still active showing signs of chewing. This was not a normal behavior and should be the effect of small amounts of a apomorphine still circu¬lating in the blood of the rat.<br>
25  In a comparative experiment 7 mg of Apomorphine hydrochloride solid was dissolved in DMSO (70 microliters). The solid mate¬rial dissolved immediately and 2 0 microliters, corresponding to 2 mg of Apomorphine hydrochloride salt, was applied to the shaved rat neck. After about 10 to 15 minutes signs of chew-<br>
30  ing and sniffing were observed. The rat became a bit sedated (due to the presynaptic effect of the drug) but continued sniffing and chewing. After about 30 minutes the rat-dis¬played stereotypy. After about two hours of intense stereo¬typy, including sniffing local motor activity rearing and<br>
35  chewing, rather abruptly, the rat stopped. After this time, the rat mostly lay down to rest. No other signs of dopaminer¬gic activity were registered after this time.<br><br>
