Description<br>
The invention relates to a feed unit for conveying fuel out of a fuel tank of a motor vehicle, with a fuel pump arranged in a baffle, with a tubular portion of the baffle, said tubular portion at least partially receiving the fuel pump, with a baseplate of the baffle, said baseplate closing off the tubular portion downward, and with a suction jet pump provided for filling the baffle with fuel from the fuel tank.<br>
Such feed units are often used in present-day motor vehicles and are known from practice. In these feed units, in particular, the suction jet pump and further components arranged in the baffle are mounted individually. This leads to a high outlay in terms of the assembly of the known feed unit and consequently to high manufacturing costs. Furthermore, in particular, the suction jet pump is a component which is complicated to manufacture and the individual parts of which have to be oriented reliably with respect to one another. A two-part configuration of the suction jet pump therefore likewise leads to a complicated assembly and high manufacturing costs of the known feed unit.<br>
The problem on which the invention is based is to develop a feed unit of the type initially mentioned, such that it is constructed in a particularly simple way and is cost-effective to manufacture.<br>
This problem is solved, according to the invention, in that the components of the suction jet pump are manufactured in one piece with the baseplate of the baffle, in that the baseplate and the tubular portion are designed as components to be<br><br>
manufactured independently of one another, and in that the baseplate has<br><br>
a margin connected sealingly to the tubular portion of the baffle.<br>
By the suction jet pump being manufactured in one piece with the baseplate, the individual components of the suction jet pump are reliably oriented with respect to one another. Moreover, the mounting of the suction jet pump in the baffle is therefore dispensed with. Furthermore, the two-part configuration of the baffle leads to a structurally simple set- up of the tubular portion and of the baseplate. The baseplate and the tubular portion can therefore be manufactured particularly cost-effectively from plastic by the injection molding method. The margin of the tubular portion makes it possible to seal off with respect to the baseplate in a particularly simple way. As a result, the feed unit according to the invention is constructed particularly simply and can be manufactured cost-effectively.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the invention, it contributes to increasing the stability of the baffle if a set- up supporting margin of the baseplate supports the margin of the tubular portion.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the invention, the supply of the suction jet pump with fuel as propellant is particularly simple if a nozzle of the suction jet pump has a duct led as far as the supporting margin of the baseplate, if the duct is closed at its end facing away from the nozzle, and if a propellant connection which faces the tubular portion is arranged between the nozzle and that end of said duct which faces away from the nozzle.<br>
It contributes to reducing the number of components of the feed unit according to the invention if the baseplate and the<br><br>
tubular portion delimit a chamber arranged between the nozzle and a mixing tube, adjoining the nozzle, of the suction jet pump, and if a bottom valve is arranged in the baseplate and issues into the chamber. Such bottom valves close the orifice when the pressure upstream of the mixing tube<br><br>
of the suction jet pump is higher than it is in the fuel tank. Otherwise, the orifice is released and fuel can be sucked in through the suction jet pump.<br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, the outlay for routing into the baffle, with as little turbulence as possible, the fuel which is conveyed by the suction jet pump can be kept particularly low if the mixing tube issues into a second chamber, and if the second chamber is connected to the remaining regions of the baffle via an overflow.<br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, the number of sealing points and of components of the baffle can be kept particularly low if the chamber is led radially outward to the tubular portion by two walls of the baseplate which lie one above the other in parallel.<br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, the fastening of the fuel pump in the baffle is particularly simple if a receptacle for a pump holder has a sleeve-shaped configuration and faces the tubular portion.<br>
It contributes to a further simplification of the manufacture of the feed unit according to the invention if the propellant connection and/or the receptacle for the pump holder project/projects vertically from the baseplate. As a result, the propellant connection and/or the receptacle for the pump holder can be manufactured in an axially-removable injection mold of the baseplate.<br>
The feed unit according to the invention makes it possible to delimit a plurality of chambers in a simple way and has high stability if the tubular portion has a supporting wall arranged<br><br>
parallel to the plane of the baseplate.<br><br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, it contributes to a further simplification of the fastening of components to be arranged in the baffle if the supporting wall has means for holding the fuel pump and/or a fine filter.<br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, it contributes to a further simplification of the fastening of the fuel pump in the baffle if the pump holder has a plurality of supporting bars projecting from the supporting wall.<br>
It contributes to a further simplification of the mounting of the feed unit according to the invention if the supporting wall has a connection piece for the propellant connection.<br>
It contributes to a further simplification of the construction of the feed unit according to the invention if the baseplate has a receptacle for the fine filter.<br>
Operation of the feed pump according to the invention can be ensured reliably, even in the case of a very low filling level of fuel in the fuel tank, if the baseplate has a first-filling orifice with a nonreturn valve and, upstream of the first- filling orifice, a depression, and if a suction connection piece of the fuel pump is led into the depression.<br>
According to another advantageous development to the invention, an intended leaktightness of the chamber delimited by the baseplate and the tubular portion can be achieved in a simple way if the tubular portion and the baseplate are connected to one another via a press fit. By virtue of this configuration, the plastic of the baseplate and of the tubular portion will swell slightly upon contact with fuel and consequently generate the intended leaktightness.<br><br>
The feed unit according to the invention has particularly high stability if the baseplate is welded to the tubular portion. Welding may in this case take place in a simple way at edges of the tubular portion and of the baseplate which are accessible from outside the baffle and which are contiguous to one another.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. To make its basic principle even clearer, one of these is illustrated in the drawing and is described below. In the accompanying drawing:<br>
figure 1 shows a part section through a feed unit according to the invention,<br>
figure 2 shows a second part section, offset with respect to the part section from figure 1, of the feed unit according to the invention,<br>
figure 3 shows a perspective illustration of a baseplate of the feed unit from figure 1,<br>
figure 4 shows a further perspective illustration of the baseplate from figure 3 in part section.<br>
Figure 1 shows a feed unit for conveying fuel out of a fuel tank to an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle. The feed unit has an electromotively driven fuel pump 2 arranged in a baffle 1 and a fine filter 3. The fine filter 3 is likewise arranged in the baffle 1 and is connected to the fuel pump 2 via a fuel line 4. Furthermore, the fine filter 3 has a connection piece 5 for a forward-flow line, not illustrated, leading to the internal combustion engine. A line 7, illustrated in figure 2, for a suction jet pump 8, likewise illustrated in figure 2, is connected to a connection 6 of the fuel pump 2. The<br><br>
baffle 1 serves for collecting fuel and has a baseplate 9 and a tubular portion 10 connected sealingly to the baseplate 9. A suction connection piece 11 of the fuel pump 2 projects into a depression 12 of the baseplate 9. The fuel pump 2 can consequently suck in fuel from the baffle 1 and convey it via the fine filter 3 to the connection piece 5 for the forward- flow line.<br>
The tubular portion 10 of the baffle 1 has a margin 14 engaging over a supporting margin 13 of the baseplate 9. The margin 14 and the supporting margin 13 are sealingly connected to one another. As shown in figures 1 and 2, a nozzle 15 and a mixing tube 16 of the suction jet pump 8 are manufactured in one piece with the baseplate 9. The nozzle 15 has a duct 17 led as far as the supporting margin 13. The duct 17 has a propellant connection 18, manufactured in one piece with the baseplate 9, for the suction jet pump 8. A supporting wall 19 of the tubular portion 10 extends parallel to the plane of the baseplate 9 and has a connection piece 20 for the propellant connection 18. The fuel line 7 leads from the connection piece 20 for the propellant connection 18 to the connection 6 of the fuel pump 2. The fine filter 3 is fastened in a receptacle 21 of the baseplate 9. Vertically led supporting bars 22 for holding the fuel pump 2 project from the supporting wall 19.<br>
As figure 3 shows in a perspective and enlarged illustration of the baseplate 9, sleeve-shaped receptacles 23 are manufactured in one piece with the baseplate 9. The supporting bars 22 illustrated in figure 2 are plugged into the sleeve-shaped receptacles 23. The baseplate 9 has two parallel walls 25, 26 delimiting a chamber 24. The chamber 24 has a bottom valve 27 for sucking in fuel from the surroundings of the baffle 1 by means of the suction jet pump 8. The components of the suction jet pump 8 which are located in the chamber 24 can be seen in a part section illustrated in figure 4. In the mounted state of the feed unit,<br><br>
the chamber 24 is delimited by the margin 14 of the tubular portion 10 of the baffle 1. Moreover, figure 4 shows that the mixing tube 16 issues into a second chamber 30 likewise delimited by walls 28, 29 of the baseplate 9. The fuel sucked in by the suction jet pump 8 via the bottom valve 27 passes via an overflow 31 of the second chamber 30 into the baffle 1. The second chamber 30, too, is sealed off by the margin 14 of the tubular portion 10 of the baffle 1. A first-filling orifice 32 with a nonreturn valve 33 issues into the depression 12 of the baseplate 9.<br><br>
