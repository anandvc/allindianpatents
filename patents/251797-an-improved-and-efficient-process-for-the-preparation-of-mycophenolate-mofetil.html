TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"AN IMPROVED AND EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD., a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses improved processes for preparing Mycophenolate Mofetil using basic reaction conditions, which reduces the reaction time and improves the purity of the product BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholinoethyl ester of Mycophenolic acid; it has the following formula (I).<br><br>
Mycophenolate mofetil<br>
Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant. It is derived from mycophenolic acid which was isolated from a fungus and chemically modified to improve oral absorption. Mycophenolate mofetil and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is used as an immunosuppressive agent, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-viral agent. US 4753935 discloses Mycophenolate mofetil and also describes three different routes for synthesis. One of the routes disclosed therein is an acid halide condensation route (Scheme-1), which requires two steps and has a high dimeric impurity content, requiring a subsequent recrystallization step. Color problem with the finished product is also associated with this synthetic route due to trace iron contamination. Use of thionyl chloride for preparation of the acid chloride causes corrosion of plant and reactors.<br>
A second carbodiimide route is also disclosed in the same patent. This route has proven impractical for the synthesis of pharmaceutical grade Mycophenolate mofetil due to unacceptable percentage of impurity in the final product.<br><br><br>
Preparation of Mycophenolate mofetil via the direct esterification of mycophenolic acid in organic solvents that are capable of removing water during the course of the reaction is also disclosed in various patents. Thus, US Patent No. 5,247,083 describes preparation of Mycophenolate mofetil by refluxing Mycophenolic acid (MPA) and 2-rnorpholinoethanol in solvents such as toluene, xylene and dichloromethane or their mixtures with azeotropic water separation. The disadvantages of this process are long reaction period necessary to reach sufficient conversion depending on the solvent used (about 60 to 100 hrs) and presence of color in the product (light violet crystal).<br>
WO 0034503 discloses biochemical synthesis of Mycophenolate mofetil as well as chemical synthesis of Mycophenolate mofetil without the use of catalyst. The synthesis<br>
according to this specification also takes a long time, in hours or days for completion and<br>
when converting MPA to Mycophenolate mofetil, it was observed that a large part of the<br>
MPA is left unconverted, and impurities are formed.<br>
WO 02100855 teaches the use of high boiling dialkyl ethers such as dibutyl ether as<br>
solvents. This route also suffers from the disadvantages described above like long reaction<br>
periods and formation of colored Mycophenolate mofetil.<br>
WO 2004089946 disclosed synthesis of Mycophenolate mofetil using microwave<br>
irradiation. Obviously, the process is costly and difficult to practice on an industrial scale.<br>
WO   2003042393,   WO   2000034503   and   WO   2006024582   describes   synthesis   of<br>
Mycophenolate mofetil using enzyme as catalyst but there are several disadvantages of the<br>
use of enzymatic catalysis on an industrial scale, for instance in terms of volume, work-up<br>
and overall cost.<br><br>
US 20040167130 discloses a process for making Mycophenolate mofetil comprising the transesterification of mycophenolic acid with 2-(4-morpholinyl) ethanol using a catalyst selected from an alkaline or alkaline earth metal salt, tin oxide or stannous oxide. This method suffer from the disadvantage that the document only describes the use of one catalyst, dibutyl tin oxide, which is highly toxic, an irritant and expensive. No other alkaline or alkaline earth metal catalyst is used and no other examples are provided in the application.<br>
WO 2005023791 describes a process for making Mycophenolate mofetil as well as purification of Mycophenolate mofetil by treating it with a primary or secondary amine. In this process also the reaction takes place under acidic reaction condition.<br>
WO 2006076802 describes a process for making Mycophenolate mofetil using Zn and Ca salt or oxide as catalyst but this route also suffer from the disadvantage like long reaction time.<br>
WO 2005105769 (Teva) discloses a compound 2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl(E)-6-(l,3-dmydro-4[2-(4-morpholinyl)emoxy]-6-memoxy-7-memyl-3-oxo-isoberizofuran-5-yl)-4-methyl-hex-4-enoate, as an impurity of Mycophenolate mofetil and a process for preparing the said impurity. However, no process for removal of the impurity is provided.<br>
WO 2008015693 (Concord Biotech) discloses an improved process for making Mycophenolate mofetil by reacting mycophenolic acid with 2-(4-morpholinyl) ethanol in presence of dipyridyl carbonate. This process also requires almost 24 hours for completion of the reaction.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for developing a process which overcomes one or more of the deficiencies of the prior art and thereby develop a modified process for preparing Mycophenolate mofetil which gives better yields, improved purity and reduces the overall reaction time. Further, in the prior art most or all the processes for making Mycophenolate mofetil take place under acidic or thermal reaction conditions. We herein disclose an improved process for preparing Mycophenolate mofetil using basic reaction conditions, which reduces the reaction time substantially and gives better purity. All of these makes the present process more commercially viable. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for preparing Mycophenolate mofetil as described in the following Scheme 2:<br><br>
Step A: The hydroxy ethyl morpholine [(H), HEM, also referred to as 4-(2-hydroxyethyI)morpholine in the specification] was converted to the corresponding metal salt (III) by reacting with alkali metal in suitable alcohols preferably straight or branched chain (C1-C7) alcohols, more preferably straight or branched chain (C1-C6) alcohols, most preferably (C1-C4) alcohols. Subsequently excess alcohol was removed under reduced pressure.<br>
Step B: The metal salt thus obtained was reacted with compound of the formula (IV) wherein, 'Lv' is selected from carboxylic acid, esters, acid chlorides and amides, in suitable organic solvent(s). Suitable organic solvents may be selected from suitable hydrocarbons such as<br><br>
hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, trimethyl benzene, duran, cyclohexane, eycloheptane or suitable halogenated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane and the like or mixtures thereof. Preferably solvent can be selected from the group comprising of toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane, benzene, cyclohexane and the like or mixtures thereof. The reaction was carried out at temperature ranging from room temperature to reflux temperature of particular solvent used under anhydrous conditions to get E-6-(l,3-dihydro-4-hydroxy-6methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-5-isobenzofuranyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoic acid 2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl ester (Mycophenolate mofetil).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Compound of formula (IV), represents alkyl esters of Mycophenolic acid. More preferably, alkyl ester of Mycophenolic acid is selected from (C1-C4) alkyl ester.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing metal salt of hydroxy ethyl morpholine.<br><br>
The hydroxy ethyl morpholine was converted to the corresponding metal salt by reacting it with alkali metal in suitable alcohols. Subsequently excess of alcohol was removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The invention also provides a novel intermediate 2-Morpholin-4-yl-potassium ethoxide, which was characterized as follows:<br>
% K(potassium)- 23-25 % (By acid / base titration), 13C Chemical Shift (67.6609, 61.7797, 59.5754, 55.0644) (Fig.4) and lH NMR spectrum is given below (Fig.3).<br><br>

3.491(t)	l1	CH2<br>
2.350(t)	2	2CH2<br><br><br>
2.312(t)	2l	CH2<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that when the reaction was carried out using the Compound "III, the reaction time was reduced substantially (from 16-24 hours reported earlier, to less than 2 hours in most of the cases as described below).<br>
In order to obtain marketing approval for a new drug product, manufacturers must submit to the regulatory authority evidence that the product is acceptable for administration to humans. Such a submission must include impurity profile of the product to demonstrate that the impurities are either absent, or present in a negligible amount. Different regulatory authorities have promulgated guidelines requiring applicants to identify the impurities present in the product and also disclose their concentration in the product. They also provide the maximum level of impurities allowable in the product. Thus for e.g. USFDA recommends that drug applicants identify all the impurities having concentration of 0.1 % or greater, in the active ingredient. Therefore, there is a need to check impurity profile and identify the impurities and also their concentration in the active ingredient.<br>
PHARMAEUROPA vol. No. 15, 4-October, 2003 lists eight possible impurities of Mycophenolate mofetil (from A to H). Subsequently, Teva in their patent application (WO2005105769) have disclosed one new impurity of Mycophenolate mofetil. Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that by the process of preparation of the present invention as described in Scheme 2, a new impurity was being formed not known earlier.<br>
The present invention thus provides a new impurity of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Compound V and having chemical name 5-Methoxy-4-methyl-6-[2-(2-methyl-5-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-2-yl)-emyl]-7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one, and<br>
has the following chemical structure:<br><br><br>

In another aspect, the invention encompasses a process for synthesizing Compound V by reacting Mycophenolic acid (VII) with 2-morpholin-4-yl-ethanol (II) in presence of suitable acid catalyst.<br><br>
Scheme-4<br>
2-morpholin-4-yl-ethanol (II) was dissolved in excess of suitable solvent(s), to it was added suitable catalysts such as p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) and the reaction mixture was stirred. Subsequently, Mycophenolic acid (VII) was added into it and the reaction mixture was further stirred under Dean Stark trap and solvent was removed continuously.<br>
The organic solvents used in above reaction may be selected from hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, trimethyl benzene, duran, cyclohcxanc, cyclohcptanc or halogcnated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane and the like or mixtures thereof and more preferably toluene.<br><br>
The reaction is carried but at temperature ranging from room temperature to about reflux temperature of the solvents used under anhydrous condition and more preferably in the range of 160-180 °C. '<br>
In an embodiment the invention encompasses Mycophenolate mofetil (I) having an amount of Compound V at about 0.01 to about 0.6% area by HPLC. This Mycophenolate mofetil (I) can be prepared according to the process described above and % impurity that was generated when using different solvent(s) and also using different reaction conditions are given below (Table-1).
