or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br>
It has been found that compounds of formula I inhibit KDR (kinase insert domain-containing receptor) and FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) kinases. These compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have antiproliferative activity and are useful in the treatment or control of cancer, in particular solid tumors. In addition these compounds have advantageous bioavailability profiles. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to methods of treating or controlling cancer, most particularly the treatment or control of breast, lung, colon and prostate tumors.<br>
Protein kinases are a class of proteins (enzymes) that regulate a variety of cellular functions. This is accomplished by the phosphorylation of specific amino acids on protein substrates resulting in conformational alteration of the substrate protein. The conformational change modulates the activity of the substrate or its ability to interact with other binding partners. The enzyme activity of the protein kinase refers to the rate at which the kinase adds phosphate groups to a substrate. It can be measured, for example, by determining the amount of a substrate that is converted to a product as a function of time. Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of a protein kinase.<br>
Tyrosine kinases are a subset of protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. These kinases play an important part in the propagation of growth factor signal transduction that leads to cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration.<br>
For example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been recognized as important mediators of tumor promoted angiogenesis. VEGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through two high affinity receptors, one of which is the kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR). See Hennequin L. F. et. al., J. Med. Chem. 2002,45(6), ppl300. FGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through the FGF receptor (FGFR). Solid tumors depend upon the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to grow. Accordingly, inhibitors of the receptors FGFR and KDR that interfere with the growth signal transduction, and thus slow down or prevent angiogenesis, are useful agents in the prevention and treatment of solid tumors. See Klohs W.E. et. al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology 1999, JO, p.544.<br>
There are several examples of small molecule inhibitors of protein kinase catalytic activity. In particular, small molecule inhibitors typically block the phosphorylation of substrates by tightly interacting with the protein kinase ATP binding site (or "active site"). See WO 98/24432 and Hennequin L. F. et. al., J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(6), ppl300. Several of these compounds inhibit multiple targets. For example, WO99/61444<br><br>
(Warner-Lambert) discloses bicyclic pyrimidines and bicyclic 3,4-dihydropyrimidines of formula<br><br>
that are asserted to inhibit cyclin dependent kinases Cdkl, Cdk2 and Cdk4 as well as the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes PDGFR and FGFR. Some compounds are also asserted to inhibit Cdk6.<br>
US Patent No. 6,150,373 (Hofftnann-La Roche Inc.) discloses bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles of formula <br>
that are stated to inhibit the T-cell tyrosine kinase p56ick.<br>
WO 01/29041 Al and WO 01/29042 (F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG) disclose alkylamino substituted bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles of formula<br><br>
that are stated to inhibit p38 mediated cellular functions and are thus inhibitors of cellular proliferation,<br>
WO 01/64679 Al (SmithKlme Beecham) discloses l,5-disubstituted-3,4-dihydro-lH-pyrimido[4,5-D]pyrimidin-2-one compounds of formula<br><br><br>
that are stated to be useful in treating CSBP/P38 kinase mediated diseases.<br>
There continues to be a need for easily synthesized, small-molecule compounds effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of protein kinases, in particular FGFR and KDR kinases for treating one or more types of solid tumors. It is particularly desirable to provide small molecule inhibitors that are selective for FGFR and KDR. This is desirable because of the potential concomitant toxicity and other undesirable complications that may follow from inhibiting multiple targets. It is preferable that such small molecule inhibitors also possess advantageous bioavailability profiles. It is thus an object of this invention to provide such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrimido compounds capable of selectively inhibiting the activity of KDR and FGFR. These compounds are useful in the treatment or control of cancer, in particular the treatment or control of solid tumors.<br><br>
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined below.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of formula I, and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating or controlling solid tumors, in particular treatment or control of breast, lung, colon and prostate tumors, most particularly breast or colon tumors, by administering to a human patient in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula I and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a process of preparing compounds of formula I and to novel intermediate compounds useful in the preparation of compounds of formula I.<br>

Kinase Assays<br>
To determine inhibition of KDR, FGFR, EGFR, and PDGFR activity, kinase assays were conducted using an HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) assay. This assay is described in A. J. Kolb et. al„ Drug Discovery Today, 1998,3(7), p 333.<br><br>
Prior to kinase reaction, recombinant EEE-tagged KDR was activated in the presence of activation buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 26 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM ATP). The enzyme was incubated at 4 °C for 1 hour.<br>
Kinase activity assays were performed in 96-well polypropylene plates (Falcon) with a total volume of 90 jiL in each well. Each well contained 1 \xM KDR substrate (Biotin-EEEEYFELVAKKKK), 1 nM activated KDR, and a test compound with one of 8 assay concentrations ranging from 100 pM to 128 pM (1:5 serial dilution). The kinase activity assay was done in the presence of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na2V04, 25 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl (from KDR stock solution), 1% DMSO (from compound), 0.3 mM ATP (at Km concentration) and 0.02% BSA. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. To stop the KDR reaction, 72 fxL of reaction mixture was transferred into a STOP plate containing 18 \iL of revelation buffer (20 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,0.02% BSA, 10 nM Eu-labelled anti-pY antibody (final cone. 2 nM), and 100 nM streptavidin (final cone. 20 nM)). After mixing, 35 \xL of solution was transferred into duplicate wells of a 384-well black plate (Costar), and read at 615/665 nm on a Wallac Victor 5 reader.<br>
FGFR, EGFR, and PDGFR activity assays were carried out as described above for the KDR activity assay with the following differences. GST-tagged FGFR enzyme was activated at room temperature for 1 hour in the following activation buffer: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM ATP. The kinase activity assay was performed with 1 \xM substrate (Biotin-EEEEYFELV), 1.5 nM activated FGFR, and test compound in the presence of 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 0.4 mM MgCl2,0.4 mM MnCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 1% DMSO, 10 ^M ATP (Km= 8.5 jiM for FGFR), 0.1 mM Na2V04&gt; and 0.02% BSA, in a total volume of 90 jaL. The rest of the assay was performed in the same manner as KDR assay.<br>
The EGFR kinase activity assay was performed with 1 \xM substrate (Biotin-EEEEYFELV), 1.5 nM EGFR, test compounds, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2,1% DMSO, 0.5 ^M ATP (Km for EGFR), 0.1 mM Na2V04, and 0.02% BSA. The rest of the assay was performed in the same manner as the KDR assay.<br>
The PDGFR kinase activity assay was performed with 1 \xM substrate (Biotin-EEEEYFELV), 1.0 nM PDGFR, test compounds, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2,1% DMSO, 2.3 \±M ATP (Km for PDGFR), 0.1 mM Na2V04&gt; and 0.02% BSA. The rest of the assay was performed in the same manner as the KDR assay.<br><br>
Compound IC50 values were determined from duplicate sets of data, and calculated by using Excel and fitting data to equation Y=[(a-b)/{l+(X/c)d]-)-b3 where a and b are enzyme activity in the presence of no test inhibitor compound and an infinite amount of inhibitor test compound, respectively, c is the IC50 and d is the hill constant of the compound response. The IC50 value is the concentration of test compound that reduces by 50% the enzyme activity under the test conditions described.<br>
The IC50 values in the above-described enzyme inhibition assays for the compounds of the invention are as follows: KDR less than 0.50 jiM; FGFR less than 2 \M.<br>

VEGF and FGF-Stimulated HUVEC Proliferation Assays<br>
The antiproliferative activity of test compounds of this invention in cell-based assays was evaluated by BrdU assay using the BrdU kit (Roche Biochemicals 1-647-229). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Clonetics CC-2519) were cultured in EGM-2 (Clonetics CC-3162) medium and seeded at 10000 cells per well in a volume of 200 pL of EGM-2 (Clonetics CC-3162) media in a 96-well flat bottom plates (Costar 3595) overnight. After 24 hours of growth at 37 °C with 5% C02, the incubation media was removed slowly by aspiration and the content of each well was washed with 300 joL pre-warmed EBM-2 (Clonetics CC-3156) containing 50 fig per mL of gentamycin and 50 ng per mL of amphotericin-B (Clonetics CC-4083). Subsequently, the remaining media was again aspirated and replaced with 160 JIL per well of serum starvation media (EBM-2 supplemented with 1% heat inactivated FBS (Clonetics CC-4102), 50 [ig per mL gentamycin and 50 ng per mL of amphotericin-B (Clonetics CC-4083), 10 units per mL of Wyeth-Ayerst heparin (NDC0641-0391-25), and 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO 25030-081). After serum starving the cells for 24 hours, 20 \xL of test compound at 10X test concentration in serum starvation medium with 2.5% DMSO was added to the appropriate wells. The control wells contained 20 jxL of serum starvation medium with 2.5% DMSO. Plates were returned to the incubator for 2 hours. After pre-incubating the cells with the test compounds for 2 hours, 20 JIL of growth factors at 10X assay concentration diluted in serum starvation media, FGF at 50 ng per mL, or VEGF (R&amp;D systems 293-VE) at 200 ng per mL were added. The final concentration of FGF in the assay was 5 ng per mL, and the final concentration of VEGF in the assays was 20 ng per mL. The growth factor free control wells had 20 jxL per well of serum starvation media with the same amount of BSA as the wells with growth factors. The plates were returned to the incubator for an additional 22 hours.<br><br>
BrdU ELISA<br>
After 24 hour exposure to the test compounds, the cells were labeled with BrdU (Roche Biochemicals 1-647-229), by adding 20 jxL per well of BrdU labeling reagent that has been diluted (1:100) in serum starvation medium. The plates were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours. The labeling medium was removed by draining the medium onto paper towels. The cells were fixed and DNA denatured by adding 200 jaL of fixation / denaturation solution to each well and incubating at room temperature for 45 minutes. The fixation / denaturation solution was drained onto paper towels and to each well was added 100 pi of anti-BrdU-POD and the wells were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The antibody solution was removed and the wells were each washed 3-4 times with 300 jaL PBS. 100 \iL of the TMB substrate solution was added to each well and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 5 - 8 minutes. The reaction was then stopped by adding 100 \xL per well of 1 M phosphoric acid. The plates were read at 450 nm with reference wavelength of 650, nm. The percent inhibition for each test compound was calculated by subtracting the absorbency of the blank (no cells) wells from all wells, then subtracting the division of the average absorbency of each test duplicate by the average of the controls from 1. The final product was then multiplied by 100 (% of inhibition = (1-average absorbency of test duplicate/average of control) 100). The IC50 value is the concentration of test compound that inhibits by 50% BrdU labeling, and is a measure of inhibition of cell proliferation. The IC50 is determined from the linear regression of a plot of the logarithm of the concentration versus percent inhibition.<br>
The IC50 values of VEGF and FGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation assays for the compounds of the invention measured as described herein are as follows: HUVEC/VEFG less than 1.00 [iM; HUVEC/bFGF less than 1.00 jxM.<br><br><br>
