COMMUNICATION STATION, ZOi^^TNTTATION METHOD AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]   The present invenrion relates to a communication station, communication method and communication system, which relay received data between communication stations.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]   For efficient data communication between a transmission station and a plurality of reception stations, a method of multicasting one packet containing data to the respective reception stations is known.  A method of raising the efficiency of a reception response has also been examined (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-502564).<br>
[0003]   There is examined a technique of causing a transmission station to resend data if a reception station cannot directly receive the data from it in multicast communication (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 08-163128). A technique of causing a relay station to transfer data has also been examined (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-252114). [0004]   In multicast communication, however, a<br>
 <br>
communication station aesi".azez as H re_ay snaricn cannot normally receive daza frcri a ^ransirJ.ssion station in some cases due tc a change in the communication link caused by obstruction (e.g., a static obstacle such as a wall or a dynamic obstacle such as a person) . When uhe cor::r:unication link changes due to a static obstacle such as a wall, transfer via a predetermined relay station enables communication.  On the other hand, when the communication link changes due to a dynamic obstacle, the relay station cannot be determined in advance.  It is therefore impossible to accurately transmit data to a communication station which cannot directly receive data from a transmission station.<br>
[0005]   In a system that enables data reception from a plurality of relay stations using a mesh topology, data transmission will reliably be performed at a very high probability even when the communication link changes due to a dynamic obstacle. However, a station repeatedly receives the same data a plurality of number of times even when it has already successfully received the data. This operation increases the power consumption.<br>
[0006]   Additionally, transferring data to a communication station which has already correctly received the data wastes the band of a wireless medium. This also increases power consumption of each terminal<br>
 <br>
and mterrerence ro ar.o'r.er 3 3rz::u-:icarion sys'cem.<br>
SUMMARY OF ~HZ INVENTION [0007]   The present invention enables to provide a communication station, communication method, and communication system capable of increasing the reliability of data communicauicn and suppressing redundant data communication.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0022]   Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.  It should be noted that the relative arrangement of the components, the numerical expressions and numerical values set forth in these embodiments do not limit the scop-? of the present invention unless it is specifically stated otherwise. [0023](First Embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 is a view showing an example of the overall arrangement of a communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. [0024]   Reference numeral 101 denotes a communication station on the transmitting side (to be referred to as a transmission station hereinafter); and reference numerals 111 to 114, communication stations on the receiving side (to be referred to as reception stations<br>
 <br>
hereinafter) which receive ca^a frcr. rr:e ::rar.srr.issicn station 101. An obstrucrcr 12'- cbsrr^icrs a wireless signal.  In this case, nhe obstrucrcr 12 0 obstructs wireless signal transmission frcir. the transmiission station 101 to the reception station 111. [0025]   Each of the transmission station 101 and the reception stations 111 to 114 incorporates a computer. The computer includes, for example, a main control unit such as a CPU, and storage units such as a ROM (Read Only Memory) and a RAM (Random Access Memory).  The computer also includes an input/output unit such as a display or a touch panel, and a communication unit such as a wireless network card. These constituent elements are connected via a bus and controlled by causing the main control unit to execute programs stored in the storage unit.<br>
[0026]   Fig. 2 is a view shoving an outline of communication in the communication system shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[0027]   Communication of each communication station is separated at predetermined time intervals (timeslots). Reference numeral 200 denotes a transmission timeslot of the transmission station 101; reference numerals<br>
210,	220, and 230, relay timeslots of the reception stations 111 to 114; and reference numerals 201 to 204,<br>
211,	213, 214, 222 to 224, 231, 232, and 234, reception responses of the reception stations. A reference<br>
 <br>
numeral that ends in 1 represe-zs = reception resDonse of the reception starior. 111. J-, reference n-uiueral that ends in 2 represents a recep~icr- response of the reception station 112.  That is, in Fig. 2, the last digits of reference numerals of the reception responses indicate the correspondence ro the reception stations<br>
111	to 114.<br>
[0028]   In the transmission timeslot 200, each of the reception station 112 and 113 returns a normal reception signal Ack by multicast within a predetermined time in response to data transmitted from the transmission station 101.  Each of the reception stations 111 and 114 returns an abnormal reception signal Nack.<br>
[0029]   In the relay timeslot 210 executed after the transmission timeslot, the reception station 111 has a transmission authorization of the highest priority order.  However, the reception station 111 has not normally received the data from the transmission station 101.  For this reason, the reception station<br>
112	having the second highest priority order transfers<br>
the data (to be also referred to as relay transmission<br>
hereinafter).  The reception station 112 has received<br>
the Nack multicast from the reception station 111, and<br>
therefore recognizes that the reception station 111 has<br>
not normally received the data. Even when the<br>
reception station 112 relay-transmits the data in the<br>
 <br>
relay timesioi: 210, the recep-Lcr. sia^^cr: the Nack 214.  That is, rhe rerepzi::n s-a-ion 114 cannot normally receive the da-a.<br>
[0030]   Since the reception s-aticn 111 has normally received the data in the relay timeslot 220, the reception station 111 having zhe highest transmission priority order relay-transmi'cs rhe data in the relay timeslot 220.  The reception station 114 which has not received any data yet also normally receives the data in this relay transmission. That is, all reception stations have succeeded in data reception. Hence, after the reception response 224, any reception stations do not perform data transmission/reception until the transmission station 101 transmits next data. [0031]   An outline of data communication from the transmission station 101 to the reception stations 111 to 114 has been described abo~e.  In the above description, after performing relay transmission in the relay timeslot 210, the reception station 112 is excluded from the transmission priority order list of the subsequent relay timeslots. Instead of removing the reception station from the list, its priority order may be lowered.  In the above description, the transmission station 101 and the communication stations (to be referred to the relay stations hereinafter) which perform relay transmission return no reception response. However, to simplify reception response<br>
 <br>
timeslot management, ^he recep-^-r. response rimeslors for the relay stations may be lefr.  If each reception station has a unit to know the ~i:me of the next transmission timeslot, the reception response timeslot of a reception station which has already transmitted an Ack may be omitted.<br>
[0032]   An example of the f\xnzt±ozial  arrangemient of a reception station shown in Fig. 1 will be explained with reference to Fig. 3.  The functional arrangement will be described here using the reception station 111 as a typical example.  The reception stations 112 to 114 also adopt the same arrangement. [0033]   The reception station 111 includes a transmission antenna 301, reception antenna 302, transmission unit 303, and reception unit 304. A priority order holding unit 305 holds the transmission priority orders of the reception stations in each relay timeslot. The priority orders held by the priority order holding unit 305 change in every relay timeslot. [0034]   A transmission authorization determination unit 306 determines transmission authorization acquisition in each relay timeslot. A time controller 307 manages each transmission timeslot.  The time controller 307 controls, for example, the timing of receiving data from the transmission station 101 or another reception station and the timing of receiving a reception response from each reception station.  The<br>
 <br>
reception srarion 111 ad-usns -'r.^  ~ine cf -he  rime controller 307 based on receired di::a, and synchronizes with the transmission staticn cr another reception station. A reception detenninazicn unit 308 determines whether data is normally received.  The reception station has been described above.<br>
[0035]   Figs. 4 and 5 are flcvcharzs illustrating an example of the sequence of processing in the reception stations 111 to 114,<br>
[0036]   The sequence of processing of receiving data from the transmission station 101 and processing in the reception response time of the reception station of interest after data reception will be described first with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
[0037]   The reception station knows the transmission timeslot of the transmission station 101 in advance. When the transmission time of the transmission station 101 has come (YES in step S401), the reception station starts reception (step 8402).<br>
[0038]   In the reception response time of the reception station of interest (YES in step S403), the reception station transmits a reception response in accordance with the reception condition of data from the transmission station 101.  If data reception is normally performed (YES in step S404), the reception station multicasts the normal reception response Ack (step S405), and ends the processing.<br>
- 19 -<br>
 <br>
[0039]   If data recepzicn ^s "-- n-mally perfcrmed (NO in step S404) , the recep-icr; s-a-icr: mul-cicasrs the abnormal reception response Nack {5~ep 54 06). After transmitting the Nack, the reception station waits until the next relay timeslot (YES in step S407 and then NO in step S408).  If data reception still fails even after all relay timeslots for one transmission data (NO in step S407), the reception station abandons acquisition of the data.  In this case, the reception station waits until the next transmission timeslot of the transmission station 101 to acqiiire next transmission data.<br>
[0040] Processing in the reception response time of another reception station will be described next with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
[0041]   This processing starts when the reception response time of any other reception station (except the reception station of interest) has come (YES in step S501) . When the processing starts, the reception station determines whether data is normally received. If data is not normally received (NO in step S502), the processing ends. This is because relay transmission is impossible if data is not normally received. [0042]   If data is normally received (YES in step S502), the reception station checks whether reception responses from the remaining reception stations include a Nack.  If no Nack is received even after the<br>
 <br>
reception response zir.e of -r.e c~r_er 5~=~ior. ;.N0 in step S503 and then YES in snep Szl-z-r   ^ie receprion station ends the processing, and wains imnil the next transmission timeslot of the "cranssission station. [0043]   If a Nack is detected from the reception responses received from the onher reception stations (YES in step S503), the reception snation determines the transmission authorization in the next relay timeslot. The transmission priority order of each terminal is predetermined in a relay timeslot. The reception station which has already received the data from the transmission station 101 acquires the transmission authorization in the next relay timeslot if no other reception station having a transmission priority order higher than that of the reception station of interest has normally received the data. [0044]   Upon acquiring the transmission authorization (YES in step S505), the reception station waits until the next relay timeslot. When the next relay timeslot starts (YES in step S506 and then YES in step S507), the reception station performs relay transmission for other reception stations which have failed in normally receiving the data (step S508), and ends the processing.  If all the relay timeslots have ended so there is no next relay timeslot anymore (NO in step S506), the processing ends. [0045](Second Embodiment)<br>
 <br>
The second embodiirier.r vill --e ~escr:_c-5d nexx. The overall arrangement of rhe =ecrr.d =—hon-^-ent is the same as in Fig. 1 of the first eri;odinen.r, and a description thereof will not be repeated. [0046]   Fig. 6 is a view showing an outline of communication in a communication system according to the second embodiment.<br>
[0047]   Communication of each communication station is separated at predetermined time intervals (timeslots). Reference numeral 600 denotes a transmission timeslot of a transmission station 101; 610, 620, and 630, relay timeslots of reception stations; and 601 to 604, 611, 613, 614, 623, 624, and 634, reception responses of the reception stations. As in the first embodiment, reference numeral that ends in 1 represents a reception response of a reception station 111. Reference numeral that ends in 2 represents a reception response of a reception station 112. That is, in Fig. 6, the last digits of reference numerals of the reception responses indicate the correspondence to the reception stations. [0048]   In the second embodiment, each reception station performs communication by CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). Each reception station executes back-off time management and carrier sense in a relay timeslot, thereby dynamically controlling the transmission station 101. [0049]   In the transmission timeslot 600, each of the<br>
 <br>
reception station 112 and 111 r=~urr.s a ncnaal reception signal Ack in resccr-se -- da-a.  "ransniit"ced from the transmission station ICl.  Each of the reception stations 111 and 114 returns an abnormal reception signal Nack.<br>
[0050]   In the relay timeslc:: 610 executed after the transmission timeslot, the reception station 111 has a transmission authorization of the highest priority order.  In the relay timeslot 610, the reception station 111 has a right to transmit without a back-off time. However, the reception station 111 has not normally received the data from the transmission station 101, and therefore does not perform transmission in the relay timeslot 610.  In this case, the reception station 112 having the second highest priority order waits for a (e.g., shortest) back-off time, and executes carrier sense. The reception station 112 checks the transmission condition of the other reception station (the reception station 111 in this case) by carrier sense, confirms that the other reception station (the reception station 111 in this case) does not perform data transmission, and then executes relay transmission. The reception station 113 must wait for a back-off time longer than that of the reception station 112. This aims at shifting the transmission start time in the relay timeslot. The reception station 113 waits for the back-off time, and<br>
 <br>
<br>
then performs carrier sense. _-.- m^5 ~: reception station 113 detec's zr.e  carrier of z'r.e reception station 112 and loses ~he tiransiiiission authorization.  Even when the reception station 112 relay-transmits the data, the reception station 114 returns the Nack 614.  That is, the reception station 114 cannot normally receive the data.<br>
[0051]   The reception station 112 having the highest transmission priority order has already performed relay transmission.  Hence, in the relay timeslot 620, the reception station 113 acquires a transmission authorization, and executes relay transmission without waiting for a back-off time.  In this case, even when the reception station 113 relay-transmits the data, the reception station 114 still returns the Nack 624. That is, the reception station 114 cannot normally receive the data.<br>
[0052]   In the relay timeslot 630, zhe  reception station 113 having the highest transmission priority order is excluded from the relay station list because it has already performed relay transmission.  In the relay timeslot 630, the reception station 114 having the second highest priority order has a transmission authorization. However, the reception station 114 does not perform relay transmission because it has failed in normally receiving the data.  In this case, the reception station 111 waits for a back-off time,<br>
 <br>
perroi-ius earner sense c-. --."e rs_—— __c_ 3_=_io.i ^^4, and then executes relay zrans-cssicr-. [0053]   An outline of data co-i-uzilca-iQr. from the transmission station 101 to the reception stations according to the second embodiment has been described above.  In the above description, rhe reception stations (e.g., the reception stations 112 and 113) which have performed relay transmission are excluded from the transmission priority order list of the subsequent relay timeslots.  Instead of removing the reception stations from the list, their priority orders may be lowered.  In the above description, the transmission station 101 and the relay stations return no reception response. However, to simplify reception response timeslot management, the reception response timeslots for the relay stations may be left.  If each reception station has a unit to know the time of the next transmission timeslot, the reception response timeslot of a reception station which has already transmitted an Ack may be omitted.<br>
[0054]   An example of the functional arrangement of a reception station according to the second embodiment will be explained with reference to Fig. 7. The functional arrangement will be described here using the reception station 111 as a typical example. The reception stations 112 to 114 also adopt the same arrangement. Note that the same reference numerals as<br>
_  1 Q  _<br>
 <br>
in Fig. 1,   and only the differenceH irerveen Fias. 3 and 7 will be described.<br>
[0055]   A carrier detection unit 503 performs carrier sense after waiting for a back-off time controlled by a time controller 307.<br>
[0056]   The time controller 3C7 decides the back-off times of the reception stations in a relay timeslot based on their transmission priority orders. A transmission authorization determination unit 306 determines the presence/absence of a transmission authorization based on the carrier detection result (the presence/absence of the carrier of another reception station) of the carrier detection unit 309. [0057]   The reception station according to the second embodiment has been described above. The sequence of processing in each of the reception stations 111 to 114 is the same as in Figs. 4 and 5 of the first embodiment, and a detailed description thereof will not be repeated. The second embodiment is slightly different from the first embodiment in the transmission authorization determination processing in step S505 of Fig. 5.  In the second embodiment, transmission authorization acquisition is determined by back-off time setting based on the CSMA and the transmission priority order. [0058](Third Embodiment)<br>

[0060]   Reference numeral 101 denotes a transmission station; and reference numerals 111 to 114, reception stations which receive data froir. the transmission station 101. An obstructor 120 obstructs a wireless signal. The transmission station 101 of the third embodiment has two transmission antennas 9011 and 9012. [0061]   Fig. 9 is a view showing an outline of communication in the communication system according to the third embodiment.<br>
[0062]   The transmission station 101 performs transmission diversity in transmission timeslots 8001 and 8002. The transmission diversity allows a reception station 111 to avoid transmission obstruction by the obstructor 120. Note that even the transmission diversity by the transmission station 101 cannot make a reception station 114 normally receive data. When the reception station 111 performs relay transmission in a relay timeslot 820, the reception station 114 can normally receive the data.<br>
[0063]   Fig. 10 is a block diagram showing an example of the functional arrangement of a transmission station according to the third embodiment. [0064]   The transmission station 101 includes the<br>

transmission antennas ii antenna 902, a data tr; Ack/Nack reception unit 904 to receive a rececuion response (Ack/Nack) from each reception station. A time controller 907 manages each timeslot.  The time controller 907 controls the data •cransirlission timing, the timing of switching between zhe transmission antennas 9011 and 9012, and the timing of receiving a reception response from each reception station. A transmission data acquisition unit 909 acquires data to be transmitted to each reception station. [00653   The transmission station according to the third embodiment has been described above.  The arrangement and the sequence of processing in each reception station are the same as in the first and second embodiments, and a description thereof will not be repeated.<br>
[0066]   As described above, according to the first to third embodiments, a reception station which has normally received data relay-transmits it to another reception station which has failed in data reception. This increases the reliability of data communication. Data transmission is not done for a reception station which has already normally received the data. This eliminates redundant data transmission/reception, reduces power consumption, and controls traffic. Without redundant data transmission/reception, it is<br>

operation in multicast communication has been described.  If the number of communication stations is known, almost the same operation can be performed even-in broadcast communication. A reception station may return not an Ack but only a Nack, or conversely, not a Nack but only an Ack.<br>
[0068]   In the first to third embodiments, expressions "transmission station" and "reception station" are used in the descriptions.  However, every communication station can serve as a transmission station. A transmission station and a reception station need not always have the relationship of a master station and a slave station.<br>
