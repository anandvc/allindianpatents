Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing a hydrocarbon component, and<br>
particularly a process for producing a high-quality branched saturated<br>
hydrocarbon component of biological origin to be used as a new kind of base oil.<br>
The process comprising ketonisation, hydrodeoxygenation, and isomerization<br>
steps utilizes as feedstock raw material of biological origin eventually derived<br>
from plant oils, animal fats, natural waxes, and carbohydrates. Also corresponding<br>
synthetic materials and combinations thereof may be used as feedstock.<br>
State of the art<br>
Base oils are commonly used for the production of lubricants, such as lubricating<br>
oils for automotives, industrial lubricants and lubricating greases. They are also<br>
used as process oils, white oils and metal working oils. Finished lubricants consist<br>
of two general components, lubricating base oil and additives. Lubricating base<br>
oil is the major constituent in these finished lubricants and contributes<br>
significantly to the properties of the finished lubricant. In general, a few<br>
lubricating base oils are used to manufacture a wide variety of finished lubricants<br>
by varying the mixtures of individual lubricating base oils and individual<br>
additives.<br>
Base oils according to the classification of the American Petroleum Institute (API)<br>
Group in or IV are used in high-quality lubricants. API base oil classification is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. API base oil classification<br><br><br>
Oils of the Group III are base oils with very high viscosity indices (VHVI)<br>
produced by modern methods from crude oil by hydrocracking, followed by<br>
isomerization of the waxy linear paraffins to give branched paraffins. Oils of<br>
Group III also include base oils produced from Slack Wax paraffins from mineral<br>
oils, and from waxes obtained by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (GTL waxes) for<br>
instance from coal or natural gas using corresponding isomerization techniques.<br>
Oils of Group IV are synthetic polyalpha-olefins (PAO). A similar classification is<br>
also used by ATTEL (Association Technique de l'Industrie Europeenne des<br>
Lubrifiants, or Technical Association of the European Lubricants Industry), said<br>
classification also comprising Group VI: Polyinternalolefins (PIO). In addition to<br>
the official classification, also Group II+ is commonly used in this field, this<br>
group comprising saturated and non-sulfurous base oils having viscosity indices<br>
of more than 110, but below 120. In these classifications saturated hydrocarbons<br>
include paraffinic and naphthenic compounds, but not aromatics.<br>
There is also available a definition for base stocks according to API 1509 as: "A<br>
base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single manufacturer to<br>
the same specifications (independent of feed source or manufacturer's location);<br>
that meets the same manufacturer's specification; and that is identified by a unique<br>
formula, product identification number, or both. Base stocks may be<br>
manufactured using a variety of different processes." Base oil is the base stock or<br>
blend of base stocks used in API-licensed oil. The known base stock types are 1)<br><br>
Mineral oil (paraffmic, naphthenic, aromatic), 2) Synthetic (polyalphaolefms,<br>
alkylated aromatics, diesters, polyol esters, polyalkylene glycols, phosphate<br>
esters, silicones), and 3) Plant oil.<br>
Already for a long time, especially the automotive industry has required lubricants<br>
and thus base oils with improved technical properties. Increasingly, the<br>
specifications for finished lubricants require products with excellent low<br>
temperature properties, high oxidation stability and low volatility. Generally<br>
lubricating base oils are base oils having kinematic viscosity of about 3 cSt or<br>
greater at 100 °C (KV100); a pour point (PP) of about -12 °C or less; and a<br>
viscosity index (VI) about 120 or greater. In addition to low pour points also the<br>
low-temperature fluidity of multi-grade engine oils is needed to guarantee that in<br>
cold weather the engine starts easily. The low-temperature fluidity is<br>
demonstrated as apparent viscosity in cold cranking simulator (CCS) tests at -5 to<br>
-40 °C temperature. Lubricating base oils having KV100 of about 4 cSt should<br>
typically have CCS viscosity at -30 °C (CCS-30) lower than 1800 cP and oils<br>
having KV100 of about 5 cSt should have CCS-30 lower than 2700 cP. The lower<br>
the value is the better. In general, lubricating base oils should have Noack<br>
volatility no greater than current conventional Group I or Group II light neutral<br>
oils. Currently, only a small fraction of the base oils manufactured today can be<br>
used in formulations to meet the latest, most demanding lubricant specifications.<br>
It is no longer possible to produce lubricants complying with the specifications of<br>
the most demanding car manufacturers, from conventional mineral oils. Typically,<br>
mineral oils often contain too high concentrations of aromatic, sulfur, and<br>
nitrogen compounds, and further, they also have a high volatility and a modest<br>
viscosity index, that is, viscosity-temperature dependence. Moreover, response of<br>
mineral oils to antioxidant additives is often low. Synthetic and so-called semi-<br>
synthetic base oils play an increasingly important role especially in automotive<br>
lubricants, such as in engine and gear oils. A similar development can be seen for<br>
industrial lubricants. Service life of lubricants is desirably as long as possible, thus<br><br>
avoiding frequent oil changes by the user, and further allowing extended<br>
maintenance intervals of vehicles for instance in commercial transportation. In the<br>
past decade, engine oil change intervals for passenger cars have increased five<br>
fold, being at best 50,000 km. For heavy-duty vehicles, engine oil change<br>
intervals are at present already on the level of 100,000 km.<br>
The production of lubricants is influenced by increasingly common "Life Cycle<br>
Approach" (LCA) concerning environment, health and safety factors of the<br>
product. What is aimed with LCA are an extended service life of the product, and<br>
minimal drawbacks to the environments associated with the production, use,<br>
handling and disposal of the product. Longer oil change intervals of high-quality<br>
base oils result in decreased consumption of non-renewable mineral crude oil<br>
based raw materials, and lower amounts of hazardous waste oil products.<br>
In addition to the demands for engine technology and base oil production, also<br>
strict environmental requirements direct the industry to develop more<br>
sophisticated base oils. Sulfur free fuels and base oils are required in order to gain<br>
full effect of new and efficient anti-pollution technologies in modern vehicles and<br>
to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile hydrocarbons and particles, as well as<br>
to achieve direct reduction of sulfur dioxide in exhaust gases. The European<br>
Union has decided that these fuels shall be available to the market from 2005 and<br>
they must be the only form on sale from 2009. Conventional mineral oil base oils<br>
contain sulfur, nitrogen, aromatic compounds, and typically also volatile<br>
compounds. They are less suitable for new engines and thus also environmentally<br>
more detrimental than newer sulfur and aromatic free base oils.<br>
Nowadays, the use of recycled oils and renewable raw materials in the production<br>
of lubricants is frequently an object of interest. The use of renewable raw<br>
materials of biological origin instead of non-renewable fossil raw materials to<br>
produce hydrocarbon components is desirable, because the fossil raw materials<br>
are exhaustible and their effect on environment is detrimental. Problems<br><br>
associated with recycled oils include complicated purification and reprocessing<br>
steps to obtain base oils with high quality. Further, the development of a<br>
functioning and extensive recycling logistic system is expensive.<br>
For the time being, only esters are used in lubricants of renewable and biological<br>
origin. The use of said esters is limited to a few special applications such as oils<br>
for refrigeration compressor lubricants, bio-hydraulic oils and metal working oils.<br>
In normal automotive and industrial lubricants, they are used mainly in additive<br>
scale. High price also limits the use of esters. In addition, the esters used in engine<br>
oil formulations are not interchangeable with other esters without performing new<br>
engine tests, even in cases where the chemical composition of the substituting<br>
ester is in principle similar. Instead, base oils consisting of pure hydrocarbon<br>
structure are partly interchangeable with each other. There are also some technical<br>
problems associated with esters. As polar compounds, esters suffer greater seal-<br>
swelling tendency than pure hydrocarbons. This has created lot of problems<br>
relating to elastomer in hydraulic applications. In addition, ester base oils are<br>
hydrolyzed more easily producing acids, which in turn cause corrosion on<br>
lubricating systems. Further, even greater disadvantage of esters is that additives<br>
developed for non-polar hydrocarbon base oils are not effective for ester base oils.<br>
Ketones are commonly used as antifoam agents, mould release agents, and in<br>
mixtures with paraffin as metal coatings, as well as components of printing inks.<br>
Processes for producing ketones are known in the art, where the functional groups<br>
of the feed molecules react with each other forming a ketone. The carbon number<br>
of the ketone formed is reduced by one compared to the sum of the carbon<br>
numbers of the reacted feed molecules. Metals or oxides of alkaline earth metals<br>
are used as catalysts. EP 591297 describes a method for producing a ketone from<br>
fatty acids by pyrolysis reaction using a magnesium oxide catalyst. EP 0457665<br>
discloses a method for producing ketones from triglycerides, fatty acids, fatty acid<br>
esters, fatty acid salts, and fatty acid anhydrides using a bauxite catalyst<br>
containing iron oxide.<br><br>
Ketones may be reduced to paraffins using Wolff-Kishner reduction. The reaction<br>
involves converting a ketone to the corresponding hydrazone (H2NNH2) and<br>
decomposition of this intermediate in the presence of base at about 200 °C to yield<br>
the reduced alkyl derivative and nitrogen. Ketone is normally heated with<br>
hydrazine hydrate and sodium hydroxide at 100 - 200 °C temperature. Diethylene<br>
glycol or dimethyl sulfoxide is used as solvent Alternatively, direct reduction of<br>
the carbonyl group to give a methylene group may be carried out with<br>
Clemmensen reduction reaction catalyzed by amalgam zinc and hydrochloric acid.<br>
Also a method for reducing ketones by catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on<br>
carbon catalyst at 50 - 150 °C temperature, under a hydrogen pressure between<br>
0.1 and 0.5 MPa is known. With non-noble metals such as nickel, a higher<br>
temperature of nearly 200 °C, and a hydrogen pressure of 30 MPa must be used as<br>
disclosed in Ullmanns Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie, 4. neubearbeitete<br>
und erweiterte Auflage, Band 13, Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim 1983,<br>
Hydrierung p. 140.<br>
FI 100248 presents a process with two steps wherein middle distillate is produced<br>
from plant oil by hydrogenation of the carboxylic acids or triglycerides of said<br>
plant oil to yield linear normal paraffins, followed by isomerization of said n-<br>
paraffins to give branched paraffins. The hydrogenation was performed at a<br>
temperature ranging from 330 to 450 °C, under a pressure of higher than 3 MPa<br>
and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) being from 0.5 to 5 1/h. The<br>
isomerization step was carried out at 200 to 500 °C temperature, under elevated<br>
pressure, and LHSV being from 0.1 to 10 1/h.<br>
EP 774451 discloses a process for isomerization of tatty acids or fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters. The isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid alkyl esters is<br>
performed using clay or another cationic catalyst. In addition to the main product,<br>
also feedstock dimers are obtained. After distillation, unsaturated branched fatty<br>
acids or fatty acid alkyl esters are obtained as the product.<br><br>
GB 1 524 781 discloses a process for producing hydrocarbons from plant oil. In<br>
this process, the plant oil feed is pyrolyzed in three zones in the presence of a<br>
catalyst at temperature of 300 - 700 °C. In the process hydrocarbons of the gas,<br>
gasoline, and diesel classes are obtained. They are separated and purified.<br>
Starting materials originating from biological sources contain high amounts of<br>
oxygen. In processing oxygen is converted to water, carbon monoxide, and carbon<br>
dioxide. In addition, starting materials of biological origin often contain nitrogen,<br>
sulfur and phosphorus known as catalyst poisons and inhibitors of noble metal<br>
catalysts. They cause decreased service life of the catalyst, and make frequent<br>
regeneration of the catalysts necessary. Noble metal catalysts are used in<br>
isomerization processes. They are very expensive and highly sensitive to catalyst<br>
poisons.<br>
Typical basic structural unit of plant and fish oils and animal fats is a triglyceride.<br>
Triglyceride is an ester of glycerol with three fatty acid molecules having the<br>
structure below:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 represent C4-C26 hydrocarbon chains. The length of the<br>
hydrocarbon chain is mainly 18 carbons (C18). C18 fatty acids are typically<br>
bonded to the middle hydroxyl group of glycerol. Typical carbon numbers of the<br>
fatty acids linked to the two other hydroxyl groups are even, being generally<br>
between carbon numbers C14 and C22.<br>
Prior to processing, starting materials of biological origin are commonly<br>
pretreated with suitable known methods such as thermally, mechanically for<br><br>
instance by means of shear force, chemically for instance with acids or bases, or<br>
physically with radiation, distillation, cooling, or filtering. The purpose of<br>
chemical and physical pretreatments is to remove impurities interfering with the<br>
process or poisoning the catalysts, and reduce unwanted side reactions.<br>
The pretreated biological raw material is often also preprocessed using a known<br>
method such as hydrolysis, transesterification, reduction, or saponification. Fatty<br>
acids may be produced from triglycerides by thermal pyrolysis treatment. In a<br>
hydrolysis reaction, oils and fats react with water yielding free fatty acids and<br>
glycerol as the product. Three main processes for the industrial production of fatty<br>
acids are known: Vapor splitting of triglycerides under high pressure, basic<br>
hydrolysis, and enzymatic hydrolysis. In the vapor splitting process, the<br>
hydrolysis of triglycerides using steam is carried out at temperatures between 100<br>
and 300 °C, under a pressure of 1 - 10 MPa, preferable conditions being from 250<br>
to 260 °C and from 4 to 5.5 MPa. Metal oxides like zinc oxide may be added as<br>
the catalyst to accelerate the reaction. High temperature and pressure contribute to<br>
the dissolution of fats in water.<br>
Fatty acid esters like triglycerides may be transesterified with an alcohol to obtain<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters. In the transesterification reaction the triglyceride structure<br>
is decomposed, the carboxylic acid yielding an ester with the alcohol, whereas the<br>
glycerol moiety of the triglyceride is liberated. Typically, methanol is used as the<br>
alcohol, but also other C1-C11 alcohols may be used. Sodium and potassium<br>
hydroxides dissolved in excess in methanol are used as catalysts. Typical<br>
conditions for the transesterification are as follows: Temperature between 60 and<br>
70 °C, pressure between 0.1 and 2 MPa. Esterification of free carboxylic acids<br>
with alcohol requires higher temperature and pressure (e.g. 240 °C and 9 MPa), or<br>
acidic conditions. For this reason, any free fatty acids present in the<br>
transesterification feed should be removed. Alternatively they can be separately<br>
esterified for instance using a sulfuric acid catalyst either before or after<br>
transesterification.<br><br>
Acidic groups of fatty acids may be directly reduced to alcohols with lithium<br>
aluminium hydride, the double bonds thus remaining in alcohols, or in a manner<br>
used in industrial scale by hydrogenation of the fatty acid alkyl esters produced by<br>
transesterification to saturated alcohols. In the hydrogenation reaction, the alcohol<br>
moiety used for the transesterification is liberated and may be recycled. Fatty acid<br>
alkyl esters are reduced with metal catalysts, typically with copper chromite under<br>
a hydrogen pressure between 25 and 30 MPa, at 210 °C. The C1-C3 alcohol<br>
liberated in the reaction is separated from the heavier fatty alcohol. Also<br>
chromium, iron or preferably rhodium activated nickel catalysts may be used at a<br>
temperature between 200 and 230 °C and under a hydrogen pressure of 25 MPa.<br>
Unsaturated alcohols are obtained in case a copper-zinc catalyst is used.<br>
Fatty aldehydes may be produced from fatty alcohols by removing hydrogen in a<br>
dehydrogenation reaction. The reaction is opposite to the hydrogenation reaction<br>
of alcohols, and thus endothermic. In the dehydrogenation reaction corresponding<br>
hydrogenation catalysts are used but the temperature is higher, and thus side<br>
reactions such as cracking, isomerization, cyclization, and polymerization are<br>
possible. Supported copper chromite catalysts are typically used for producing<br>
aldehydes from alcohols. In gas phase dehydrogenation, typically a temperature<br>
between 250 and 400 °C, and a pressure between 0.1 and 0.5 MPa are used.<br>
Moreover, it is generally known that corresponding aldehydes can be produced<br>
from alcohols using alumina, silica-alumina, hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide<br>
as catalyst. The products of the process are controlled by changes in process<br>
temperature. At low temperatures ethers are obtained, high temperatures give<br>
aldehydes, whereas olefins are typically obtained at 300 - 350 °C.<br>
Oils, fats and free fatty acids may be saponified in aqueous solutions by reaction<br>
with metal hydroxides such as alkali metal hydroxides yielding metal salts of fatty<br>
acids, and glycerol. In addition to sodium hydroxide, also for instance potassium<br>
oxide or zinc oxide may be used. In this case the formed soap has poor solubility<br><br>
in water and is readily isolated from the glycerol, which is soluble in water. In a<br>
traditional saponification process, the basic hydrolysis of triglycerides is<br>
performed at about 100 °C, under normal pressure.<br>
Neither the use of heteroatom containing starting materials of biological origin in<br>
a process for producing high-quality saturated base oils has not been disclosed,<br>
nor there are any reports about the use of heteroatom containing, optionally<br>
thermally and/or chemically and/or physically and/or mechanically treated<br>
intermediate materials of biological origin in a process for producing high-quality<br>
saturated base oils.<br>
On the basis of the above teaching it may be seen that there is an obvious need for<br>
an alternative process for producing branched saturated hydrocarbon components<br>
from starting materials of biological origin. There is also a need for nonpolar<br>
saturated base oils complying with the quality requirements for high-quality base<br>
oils, said base oils being preferably of biological origin and having more<br>
preferable effects on the environment and for end users than traditional mineral<br>
base oils.<br>

The characteristic features of the process and base oils of the invention are<br>
presented in the appended claims.<br>
General description of the invention<br>
The process of the invention for producing a hydrocarbon component, and<br>
particularly a high-quality saturated hydrocarbon base oil of biological origin,<br>
comprises a ketonisation step, a hydrodeoxygenation step and an isomerization<br>
step. The isomerization step refers here both to isomerization of unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids and alkyl esters of carboxylic acids, particularly unsaturated fatty<br>
acids and fatty acid alkyl esters, and also isomerization of paraffins. Isomerization<br>
of fatty acids and fatty acid alkyl esters is performed prior to the ketonisation step,<br>
whereas the isomerization of paraffins is carried out following the ketonisation<br>
and HDO steps.<br>
Carboxylic acids and their derivatives or combinations thereof, preferably fatty<br>
acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, anhydrides of fatty acids, or<br>
metal salts of fatty acids of biological origin, are used as the feedstock of the<br>
process. Said starting materials of biological origin may be pretreated if<br>
necessary, and/or preprocessed using known methods.<br>
Here, saturated base oil comprises saturated hydrocarbons. The term "saturated<br>
hydrocarbons" refers to paraffinic and naphthenic compounds, but not to<br><br>
aromatics. Paraffinic compounds may either be branched or linear. Naphthenic<br>
compounds are cyclic saturated hydrocarbons, or cycloparaffins, typically derived<br>
from cyclopentane or cyclohexane. A naphthenic compound may comprise a<br>
single ring structure (mononaphthene) or two isolated ring structures (isolated<br>
dinaphthene), or two fused ring structures (fused dinaphthene) or three or more<br>
fused ring structures (polycyclic naphthenes or polynaphthenes).<br>
Here, ketonisation refers to the ketonisation reaction of carboxylic acids and the<br>
derivatives thereof, particularly fatty acids, corresponding esters, alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, anhydrides, and metal salts. In the reaction the functional groups of the<br>
feedstock react with each other yielding ketones. The ketonisation reaction of two<br>
carboxylic acids proceeds through an anhydride intermediate to give a ketone,<br>
water and carbon dioxide liberating in the reaction. In the pyrolytic ketonisation<br>
reaction of anhydrides and metal salts carbon dioxide is liberated. For alcohols<br>
and esters, the ketonisation reaction proceeds via aldehydes to give a Tishchenko<br>
ester and further to ketones, for aldehydes via Tishchenko esters to ketones. In<br>
these two last reactions carbon monoxide and hydrogen is liberated.<br>
Fatty acids refer here to carboxylic acids of biological origin, having carbon<br>
numbers higher than CI.<br>
Fatty acid esters refer here to triglycerides, fatty acid alkyl esters, esters of fatty<br>
acids with fatty alcohols, and natural waxes, all being of biological origin.<br>
In this context, the term polyol refers to alcohols having two or more hydroxy!<br>
groups.<br>
Here, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers to oxygen removal from a compound by<br>
means of hydrogen. Water is liberated in the reaction, and simultaneously olefinic<br>
double bonds are hydrogenated and any sulfur and nitrogen compounds are<br><br>
removed. Reactions of the HDO step are exothermal. After the HDO step, the<br>
structure of the starting material has become paraffinic.<br>
In this context, isomerization refers both to the isomerization of carboxylic acids<br>
and alkykl esters thereof, and to hydroisomerization.<br>
Isomerization of unsaturated carboxylic acids or alkyl esters of carboxylic acids,<br>
particularly fatty acids or fatty acid alkyl esters refers here to their conversion to<br>
branched compounds without altering their carbon number.<br>
Hydroisomerization refers here to the isomerization of linear paraffins to give<br>
branched paraffins.<br>
In this context, carbon number range refers to the difference of the carbon<br>
numbers of the largest and the smallest molecules, plus one, in the final product.<br>
In this context, pressures are gauge pressures relative to normal atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
Classification of the Periodic System of the Elements is the IUPAC classification.<br>

In figure 1, at least one of the following starting materials is introduced to the feed<br>
tank 30 either as separate components or as mixtures: fatty acids 4, fatty acid<br>
esters 9, aldehydes 5, alcohols 6 or acid anhydrides 7, and dicarboxylic acid feed<br>
3 or polyols 13 is introduced as optional additional feedstock. Part of the lighter<br>
recirculated product fraction (for instance 102) or another hydrocarbon stream 201<br>
may be optionally added to the feed tank 30 as a diluent. The diluent stream 202<br>
comprises the recirculated stream 102 or hydrocarbon stream 201 or a mixture<br>
thereof. From the feed tank 30, the feedstock stream 31 and hydrogen stream 105<br>
are passed to an optional prehydrogenation reactor 40, followed by the passing of<br>
the prehydrogenated stream 41 to the ketonisation reactor 50, optionally also<br>
receiving the diluent 202. From the ketonization reactor 50, the ketone product 51<br>
and hydrogen stream 105 are passed to the hydrodeoxygenation reactor 60,<br>
optionally also receiving the diluent 202. The paraffinic product 61 from the<br>
hydrodeoxygenation reactor 60 is passed to stripping 70 where unwanted<br>
impurities are removed. Thereafter, the paraffinic product stream 71 and hydrogen<br>
stream 105 are passed to hydroisomerization reactor 80, optionally also receiving<br>
additional paraffinic feedstocks such as slack wax and Fisher-Tropsch waxes or<br>
waxes produced by gasification of biomaterial (biomaterial to liquids, BTL) 8,<br>
and the diluent 202. Following hydroisomerization 80, branched paraffins 81 may<br>
be subjected to optional hydrofinishing 90 using a hydrogen stream 105, followed<br>
by passing the product as the stream 91 to a distillation and separation unit 100.<br>
Branched paraffins 82 may optionally be passed from the hydroisomerization<br>
reactor 80 to dewaxing 110 wherein linear paraffins are removed either with<br>
solvents or catalytically in a known manner. Separated linear paraffins may be<br>
recirculated as stream 111 to the hydroisomerization reactor 80 for paraffins,<br>
while branched paraffins are passed as the stream 112 to the hydrofinishing<br>
reactor 90. In the distillation and/or separation unit 110, product components<br><br>
boiling at different temperature ranges and/or for special applications; gasses 104,<br>
gasoline 101, diesel 102, and base oil 103, are separated.<br>
In figure 2, the unsaturated free fatty acid 3 and fatty acid alkyl ester feed 21 are<br>
introduced into the feed tank 30 as separate components or as mixtures. Part of the<br>
lighter product fraction to be recirculated (for instance 102) or another<br>
hydrocarbon 201 may be optionally passed to the feed tank 30 as a diluent. The<br>
diluent stream 202 comprises the recirculated stream 102 or hydrocarbon stream<br>
201 or a mixture thereof. From the feed tank 30, the feedstock stream 31<br>
containing fatty acids and/or fatty acid alkyl esters is passed to the isomerization<br>
reactor 40 for branching the components. Following isomerization, but prior to<br>
ketonisation, an optional prehydrogenation may be performed wherein branched<br>
fatty acid and/or fatty acids alkyl ester components are passed as the stream 41 to<br>
the double-bond prehydrogenation reactor 50 also receiving the hydrogen stream<br>
6 and the optional diluent 202. Thereafter the fully saturated branched fatty acid<br>
and/or fatty acid alkyl ester feedstock 51 is introduced to the ketonization reactor<br>
60 optionally also receiving the dicarboxylic acid feed 5, and the optional diluent<br>
202. Following ketonization 60, the ketone product 61 and hydrogen stream 6 are<br>
passed to hydrodeoxygenation reactor 70 optionally also receiving the diluent<br>
202. Following hydrodeoxygenation 70, the branched paraffinic product stream<br>
71 and hydrogen stream 6 may be optionally passed to hydrofinishing 80. From<br>
the hydrofinishing reactor 80, the branched paraffinic product obtained is passed<br>
as the stream 81 to a distillation and separation unit 90 wherein product<br>
components boiling at different temperature ranges and/or for special<br>
applications; gas 100, diesel 102, and base oil 103, are separated.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It was now surprisingly found that branched saturated hydrocarbon components,<br>
suitable as high-quality base oils, not containing heteroatoms may be obtained by<br>
the process of the invention. Feed selected from carboxylic acids and/or<br><br>
derivatives thereof, preferably fatty acids, esters of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty<br>
aldehydes, anhydrides of fatty acids, and metal salts of fatty acids of biological or<br>
synthetic origin, or combinations thereof may be used in the process. In the<br>
process of the invention, ketonisation, hydrogenation, and isomerization reactions<br>
are utilized. Branched saturated hydrocarbon components are obtained as the<br>
product.<br>
In the ketonisation reaction the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the feedstock is<br>
increased to such that only carbon-carbon bonds are left in the basic structure of<br>
the molecule. Such a ketone is not suitable as base oil. The oxygen present in the<br>
ketone group must be removed, and the low temperature properties must be<br>
improved for instance by making short branches to the molecular structure.<br>
In the process of the invention, the feedstock is subjected to ketonisation,<br>
hydrodeoxygenation, and isomerization. In case unsaturated carboxylic acids<br>
and/or esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids, preferably fatty acids and/or fatty<br>
acid alkyl esters are used as the feedstock, the isomerization may be performed<br>
prior to ketonisation followed by hydrodeoxygenation, otherwise the<br>
isomerization is carried out after ketonization and hydrodeoxygenation steps.<br>
Feed selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acids and derivatives<br>
thereof, preferably fatty acids, esters of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes,<br>
anhydrides of fatty acids, or metal salts of fatty acids, of biological origin, or<br>
combinations thereof is ketonised in the process. By this means the hydrocarbon<br>
chain length of the feedstock may be increased, and it preferably reaches the<br>
carbon number of the base oil. In the ketonisation step one may also utilize<br>
feedstocks that are different than those based on fatty acids. Such components are<br>
for example dicarboxylic acids or polyols. These feedstocks are ketonised at all<br>
the functional groups, thus increasing the molecular mass of the product compared<br>
to ketones formed of only two fatty acids. In this case, a polyketone molecule is<br>
formed, said polyketone being treated in a similar manner as monoketones. If<br><br>
necessary, the biological starting material may be subjected to one or more<br>
pretreatment or purification steps of the prior art for preparation of the feedstock<br>
before ketonisation reaction.<br>
In the hydrodeoxygenation step of the process of the invention, the ketone is<br>
treated with hydrogen to give paraffins. The oxygen present in the ketone is<br>
liberated as water, and any other oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur containing<br>
compounds are hydrogenated to paraffins, too. In addition, olefinic bonds are<br>
hydrogenated. After hydrodeoxygenation light hydrocarbons are removed as<br>
gases.<br>
The hydrocarbon component obtained from the hydrodeoxygenation step may be<br>
subjected to hydroisomerization giving branched hydrocarbon chains. Following<br>
hydroisomerization step, the oxidation stability of the product may be improved<br>
using an optional finishing treatment. In addition, an optional dewaxing may be<br>
performed prior to or after the finishing.<br>
In case unsaturated carboxylic acids or esters such as fatty acids and/or fatty acid<br>
alkyl esters are used as the feedstock, the isomerization may be carried out prior<br>
to ketonization, followed then by ketonization of the isomerized product, and the<br>
HDO step is performed as the last step of the process. In said isomerization,<br>
branches are formed in the structure of the compound, thus giving a mixture of<br>
isomerized components. Dimers, and to a lesser extent trimers of the feedstock<br>
components are obtained as by-products.<br>
The steps of the process of the invention are preferably carried out in the order of<br>
ketonisation, hydrodeoxygenation, and as the last step isomerization.<br>
The process may also be used for processing of mixtures feeds originating from<br>
biological starting materials and synthetic feedstocks, in which case additional<br>
synthetic feedstocks, or feedstocks produced with other processes may be used.<br><br>
Also pure synthetic feedstocks may be used, but then the products are not based<br>
on renewable natural resources. In the processing, in addition to paraffins of<br>
biological origin such as paraffins obtained in the process of invention or BTL<br>
paraffins produced in processes of biomaterial gasification, also Fischer-Tropsch<br>
waxes and/or Slack waxes obtained from crude oil by solvent dewaxing may be<br>
used as additional feedstocks in hydroisomerization. Of synthetic processes, the<br>
oxo-process and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are stages in known processes for<br>
producing liquid products from starting materials containing carbon and<br>
hydrogen, such as from coal or natural gas.<br>
Feedstock<br>
The feed comprises at least one component selected from triglycerides, carboxylic<br>
acids having a carbon number C1-C38, esters of C1-C38 carboxylic acids with C-<br>
C11 alcohols, C1-C38 alcohols, C1-C38 aldehydes, C1-C38 carboxylic acid<br>
anhydrides, and metal salts of C1-C38 carboxylic acids. Preferable feedstocks are<br>
C4-C24 fatty acids of biological origin, and/or the derivatives thereof, mentioned<br>
above, or combinations thereof. Preferable components of the feedstock are C4-<br>
C24 fatty acids, C4-C24 fatty acid alkyl esters such as methyl esters, and esters of<br>
fatty acids with C12-C38 alcohols having long chains, natural waxes, C4-C24<br>
fatty alcohols reduced from fatty acids, C4-C24 aldehydes reduced from fatty<br>
acids, C4-C24 fatty acid anhydrides, and metal salts of C4-C24 fatty acids.<br>
Dicarboxylic acids, polyols, triglycerides, and their mixtures with the above<br>
mentioned feedstocks may also be used as feed components.<br>
Feed components are produced using any known methods, preferably from<br>
starting materials of biological origin, such as materials derived from plants,<br>
animals and fishes, selected from the group consisting of plant oils, plant waxes,<br>
plant fats, animal oils, animal fats, animal waxes, fish oils, fish fats, fish waxes.<br>
Corresponding starting materials derived from algae and insects are also<br>
contemplated as well as starting materials derived from aldehydes and ketones<br><br>
prepared from carbohydrates. C1-C38 and preferably C4-C24 fatty acids, or<br>
corresponding hydroxy acids or alcohols, act as structural units in suitable starting<br>
materials of biological origin. Since in the processing of fatty acids the service life<br>
of the catalyst is typically short, esters and alcohols may be optionally used as<br>
feedstocks causing less coke formation on the catalyst.<br>
The starting materials of biological origin are suitably selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
a)	plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish<br>
fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
b)	free fatty acids or fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis, acid transesterification or<br>
pyrolysis reactions from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal<br>
oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
c)	esters obtained by transesterification from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes,<br>
animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
d)	fatty acid alkyl esters obtained by esterification of alcohols with fatty acids of<br>
plant, animal and fish origin, and<br>
e)	fatty acid metal salts obtained by saponification of free fatty acids, plant fats,<br>
plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish<br>
oils, fish waxes, and<br>
f)	alcohols and aldehydes obtained as reduction or hydrogenolysis products of<br>
free fatty acids, or fatty acids from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal<br>
fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
g)	fatty alcohols obtained by hydrolysis, transesterification and pyrolysis from<br>
waxes of biological origin, and<br>
h) anhydrides of fatty acids from plant fets, plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats,<br>
animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
i) waste and recycled food grade fats and oils, and fats, oils and waxes obtained<br>
by genetic engineering, and<br>
j) mixtures of said starting materials.<br><br>
Metal salts are alkaline earth or alkali metal salts, preferably Ca, Zn, Mg, Al, or<br>
Na salts. Natural waxes are fatty acids esterified with alcohols having long<br>
hydrocarbon chains. The carbon number of fatty acid and alcohol hydrocarbon<br>
chains is typically from C12 to C38.<br>
The starting material of biological origin may also be other than triglyceride,<br>
ester, fatty acid, alcohol or aldehyde, or a mixture of the said starting materials if<br>
the hydrocarbon chain length of the biological starting material is suitable or can<br>
be processed to be suitable to the level required for diesel and base oil<br>
applications.<br>
If necessary, the starting material of biological origin may be pretreated or<br>
purified by suitable known methods as described above. For instance it may be<br>
distillated to fractions having narrower boiling ranges or carbon number<br>
distributions or ranges. Furthermore the impurities detrimental to the properties of<br>
the feedstock or final product may be removed by filtration through suitable<br>
filtering aids.<br>
In addition to compound types described above, also totally or partly synthetic<br>
compounds, as well as mixtures of the compound types described above with<br>
synthetic compounds are also suitable feedstocks.<br>
Examples of suitable biological starting materials include fish oils such as baltic<br>
herring oil, salmon oil, herring oil, tuna oil, anchovy oil, sardine oil, and mackerel<br>
oil; plant oils such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower seed oil,<br>
soybean oil, corn oil, hemp oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil,<br>
peanut oil, castor oil, jatropha seed oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil; and<br>
moreover, suitable are also animal fats such as lard, tallow, and also waste and<br>
recycled food grade fats and oils, as well as fats, waxes and oils produced by<br>
genetic engineering. In addition to fats and oils, suitable starting materials of<br><br>
biological origin include animal waxes such as bee wax, Chinese wax (insect<br>
wax), shellac wax, and lanoline (wool wax), as well as plant waxes such as<br>
carnauba palm wax, ouricouri palm wax, jojoba seed oil, candelilla wax, esparto<br>
wax, Japan wax, and rice bran oil.<br>
In the ketonization step of the process of the invention, also free carboxylic acids<br>
or esters thereof may optionally be used as feedstocks. These linear or branched<br>
mono and/or dicarboxylic acids may be produced by petrochemical processes or<br>
oxo processes. Suitable monocarboxylic acids include for instance propionic,<br>
butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl butanoic, 2-ethyl butanoic, valeric, isovaleric,<br>
caproic, heptanoic, caprylic, pelargonic, isononanoic, caprinic, lauric, myristic,<br>
rnyristoleic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, elaidic, linolic, linoleic,<br>
arachidonic, behenic, and lignin acids. Suitable dibarboxylic acids include for<br>
example the following: oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic,<br>
suberic, azelaic, and sebasic acids.<br>
In case where alcohols are ketonised in the process of the invention, also diols<br>
and/or polyols may be used as the feedstock in addition to fatty alcohols. Suitable<br>
diols include for instance diols derived from dicarboxylic acids, dimers of fatty<br>
alcohols, and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanedioI (NPG). Examples of suitable<br>
polyhydric alcohols include glycerol, 2-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol<br>
(TMP), 2-methyl-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-dioI (TME), 2-butyl-2-ethyl-<br>
propanediol (BEPD), and 2,2-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol (PET).<br>
Preferably alcohols containing tertiary carbons are not used when the thermal<br>
stability of the base oil to be produced has to be good.<br>
Feedstocks used in the isomerization of unsaturated carboxylic acids, or alkyl<br>
esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids; particularly in the isomerization of<br>
unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid esters, contain at least 20 %, preferably at<br>
least 50 %, and particularly preferably at least 80 % by weight of compounds<br>
having double bonds. The feedstock may also be a mixture of unsaturated<br><br>
carboxylic acids and unsaturated carboxylic acid alkyl esters. Typically, the<br>
number of unsaturated bonds in compounds of the feedstock is 1 to 3. Preferably<br>
the feedstock comprises at least 40 % by weight of monounsaturated fatty acids or<br>
fatty acid esters, more preferably at least 70 % by weight. The feedstock may also<br>
comprise polyunsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid esters. The presence of an<br>
unsaturated bond in the molecule causes the formation of a cation as an<br>
intermediate, thereby facilitating the skeletal isomerization reaction.<br>
Hydrocarbon may optionally be added as a diluent to the feedstock and/or in<br>
various process stages, such diluent may be for instance hydrocarbon of the<br>
middle distillate diesel class. Boiling ranges of hydrocarbons of the diesel class<br>
are between 150 and 400 °C, typically between 180 and 360 °C.<br>
Process<br>
In the process according to the invention, the feedstock is subjected to<br>
ketonisation, hydrodeoxygenation, and isomerization.<br>
Isomerization step of unsaturated carboxylic acids and/or esters<br>
The isomerization may be carried out prior to the ketonisation step in case the<br>
feedstock comprises unsaturated carboxylic acids and/or alkyl esters of<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids, preferably unsaturated fatty acids and/or unsaturated<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters. Acidic catalyst materials are used as the catalysts.<br>
Preferable the isomerization catalysts are aluminium phosphates, silica aluminium<br>
phosphates and zeolites, the catalyst preferably being a zeolite of the pentasil or<br>
mordenite type. The reaction temperature ranges from 150 to 350 °C, preferably<br>
from 200 to 290 °C, the reaction pressure being between 0 and 5 MPa, preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 2 MPa. Pressure is used to prevent lighter components from<br>
evaporating. Water or a lower alcohol may be added to the feedstock to suppress<br>
acid anhydride formation due to dehydration or dealcoholation. It is preferable to<br>
add water when the feedstock comprises unsaturated fatty acids and alcohol or<br><br>
when the feedstock comprises esters of unsaturated fatty acids. Typically the<br>
amount of added water or lower alcohol is 0 - 8 %, and preferably 1-3 % by<br>
weight based on the total reaction mixture. The lower alcohol is C1 - C5 alcohol,<br>
and preferable alcohols are methanol, ethanol and propanol, with a greater<br>
preference given to those having the same alkyl group as that of the starting fatty<br>
acid ester to be isomerized. Excess water (more than 10 %) should be avoided in<br>
order to prevent estolide formation. This skeletal isomerization step may also be<br>
carried out in the absence of water or lower alcohol In case the reaction is<br>
performed as a batch reaction, the amount of the catalyst ranges from 0.01 to 30<br>
% by weight of the total reaction rnixture, preferably from 0.5 to 10 %, by weight.<br>
In the batch reactor, the reaction time is less than 16 hours, preferably less than 8<br>
hours, particularly preferably less than 4 hours. In case a fixed bed reactor is used,<br>
the feed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 0.1 - 100 1/h, where the amount<br>
of the feedstock is expressed in grams per hour per grams of the catalyst.<br>
Prehydrogenation step<br>
The isomerized product obtained above, or the non-isomerized feedstock may be<br>
subjected to an optional prehydrogenation prior to the ketonisation step to reduce<br>
side reactions caused by the double bonds. Prehydrogenation is performed as a<br>
separate process under mild conditions. Prehydrogenation is performed in the<br>
presence of a prehydrogenation catalyst, at a temperature between 50 and 400 °C,<br>
under a hydrogen pressure ranging from 0.1 to 20 MPa, the feed flow rate WHSV<br>
being between 0.1 and 10 1/h, the conditions preferably comprising temperatures<br>
between 100 and 300 °C, hydrogen pressures ranging from 1 to 15 MPa, WHSV<br>
being from 0.5 to 5 1/h, particularly preferable conditions comprising temperatures<br>
between 150 and 280 °C, pressures ranging from 2 to 10 MPa, WHSV being from<br>
1 to 3 1/h. The prehydrogenation catalyst may contain metals of the Group VIII<br>
and/or VIA of the periodic system of the elements. The prehydrogenation catalyst<br>
is preferably a supported Pd, Pt, Ni, Ru, Rh, NiMo or CoMo catalyst, the support<br>
being activated carbon, alumina and/or silica.<br><br>
The optionally prehydrogenated product from the isomerization of fatty acids<br>
and/or fatty acid alkyl ester, or the optionally prehydrogenated feedstock is passed<br>
to the ketonisation step yielding as the product a ketone with an increased<br>
hydrocarbon chain length. The obtained ketone is hydrogenated in the HDO step<br>
to give saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Ketonisation step<br>
In the ketonisation step, the pressure ranges from 0 to 10 MPa, preferably from<br>
0.1 to 5 MPa, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 1 MPa, whereas the temperature<br>
ranges between 100 and 500 °C, preferably between 100 and 400 °C, particularly<br>
preferably between 300 and 400 °C, the feed flow rate WHSV being from 0.1 to<br>
10 1/h, preferably from 0.3 to 5 1/h, particularly preferably from 0.3 to 3 1/h. In the<br>
ketonisation step metal oxide catalysts may be used. Typical metals include Na,<br>
Mg, K, Ca, Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Rh, Cd, Sn, La, Pb, Bi,<br>
and rare earth metals. These metal oxides may be on a support, typical supports<br>
being laterite, bauxite, titanium dioxide, silica and/or aluminium oxide. The metal<br>
is preferably molybdenum, manganese, magnesium, iron and/or cadmium, the<br>
support being silica and/or alumina Particularly preferably the metal is<br>
molybdenum, manganese and/or magnesium as oxide in a catalyst without<br>
support. No special catalysts are needed for the ketonisation of metal salts of fatty<br>
acids (soaps), since the metal present in the soap promotes the ketonization<br>
reaction.<br>
Hydrodeoxygenation<br>
In the HDO step of the invention, the ketone and hydrogen gas are reacted under a<br>
pressure ranging between 0.1 and 20 MPa, preferably between 1 and 15 MPa,<br>
particularly preferably from 2 to 10 MPa, the temperature being from 100 to 500<br>
°C, preferably from 150 to 400 °C, particularly preferably from 200 to 350 °C, the<br>
flow rate WHSV varying from 0.1 to 10 1/h, preferably from WHSV 1 to 5 1/h,<br>
and particularly preferably from WHSV 1 to 3 1/h. In the HDO step, special<br>
catalysts containing a metal of the Group VIII and/or VIA of the periodic system<br><br>
of the elements, on a support may be used. The HDO catalyst is preferably a<br>
supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or CoMo catalyst, the support being activated carbon,<br>
alumina and/or silica.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, the reaction product obtained after the HDO step is<br>
purified for instance by stripping with steam, or with a suitable gas such as a light<br>
hydrocarbons, nitrogen or hydrogen. It is preferable for the process to remove<br>
impurities and water as efficiently as possible prior to the hydro isomerization<br>
step and/or finishing step.<br>
In case the feedstock is already subjected to the isomerization of fatty acids and/or<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters, only optional finishing and separation steps are performed<br>
after the HDO and the optional purification steps.<br>
Isomerization step as hydroisomerization<br>
In case the isomerization of carboxylic acids and/or carboxylic acid alkyl esters<br>
was not carried out, a hydroisomerization step is carried out after the ketonisation,<br>
HDO and optional purification steps. In this case the hydrogenated product<br>
obtained from ketonisation followed by hydrodeoxygenation, and optional<br>
paraffinic additional feed are passed to the hydroisomerization reactor to react<br>
with hydrogen gas in the presence of a isomerization catalyst. In the<br>
hydroisomerization step, the pressure ranges from 0 to 20 MPa, preferably from 1<br>
to 15 MPa, and particularly preferably from 4 to 10 MPa. The temperature ranges<br>
between 100 and 500 °C, preferably between 200 and 400 °C, and particularly<br>
between 250 and 370 °C. The flow rate WHSV in between 0.1 and 10 1/h,<br>
preferably between 1 to 5 1/h, and particularly preferably between 1 and 3 1/h. In<br>
the hydroisomerization step, special isomerization catalysts containing molecular<br>
sieves and metals of the Group VIII of the periodic system of the elements, for<br>
instance Ni, Pt, and Pd, may be used. Alumina and/or silica may be used as<br>
supports.<br><br>
Dewaxing step<br>
Following ketonisation, HDO and hydroisomerization steps of the feedstock, an<br>
optional dewaxing may be performed either catalytically or as solvent-based<br>
dewaxing. An optional dewaxing may also be carried out after the isomerization,<br>
ketonisation and HDO steps of unsaturated fatty acid and/or fatty acid alkyl ester<br>
feedstock.<br>
In the catalytic dewaxing, hydrogen gas and the hydrogenated component, as well<br>
as the optional paraffinic additional feed react in the presence of a dewaxing<br>
catalyst. Zeolite catalysts comprising metals of the Group VIII of the periodic<br>
system of the elements such as Ni, Pt or Pd are used as dewaxing catalysts. In the<br>
dewaxing step, the pressure varies from 0.1 to 20 MPa, the temperature being<br>
between 100 and 500 °C.<br>
In the solvent-based dewaxing, linear paraffinic waxes are separated by dissolving<br>
the oil (hydrocarbon product) in a mixture of solvents, for instance methylethyl<br>
ketone and toluene. In the process, the solvent and the feed are passed in counter<br>
current manner and thus mixed. The mixture of oil and solvent is introduced to a<br>
cooling unit. Cooling results in the crystallization of the linear paraffinic waxes,<br>
whereas branched paraffins remain as oily liquids. The temperature used depends<br>
on the target low temperature properties of the product, the pour point of the final<br>
product decreasing as the temperature in dewaxing is decreased. Wax crystals are<br>
filtered from the mixture, collected for further processing, and the solvent is<br>
separated by evaporation from the base oil. Solvent-based dewaxing is also<br>
suitable for fatty acids and/or fatty acid alkyl esters after isomerization and<br>
prehydrogenation of the double bonds. Linear fatty acids and/or linear fatty acid<br>
alkyl esters are thus separated from the mixture of branched and non-crystallizable<br>
compounds by dissolving the feed for instance in hexane, and cooling as<br>
described above.<br>
Finishing step<br><br>
The above obtained and optionally dewaxed product may optionally be finished<br>
for removing any double bonds and aromatics. In hydrofinishing, the finishing is<br>
performed using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, the pressure ranging from<br>
1 to 20 MPa, preferably from 2 to 15 MPa, and particularly preferably from 3 to<br>
10 MPa, and the temperature ranges between 50 and 500 °C, preferably between<br>
200 and 400 °C, and particularly preferably between 200 and 300 °C. In the<br>
hydrofinishing, special catalysts containing metals of the Group VIII of the<br>
periodic system of the elements, and a support may be used. The hydrofinishing<br>
catalyst is preferably a supported Pd, Pt, or Ni catalyst, the support being alumina<br>
and/or silica. Finishing may also be achieved by removing polar components<br>
using adsorption materials, such as clay or molecular sieves.<br>
Following optional finishing, the product is passed to a distillation and/or<br>
separation unit in which product components boiling over different temperature<br>
range and/or product components intended for different applications are separated<br>
from each other.<br>
If desired, the hydrocarbon component obtained as the product, or another suitable<br>
hydrocarbon may be used as a diluent in various stages of the process of the<br>
invention, such as in the ketonization, HDO and/or isomerization steps for<br>
increasing the conversion and/or selectivity and/or for controlling the exothermal<br>
nature of the reactions.<br>
A fixed bed reactor, for instance the trickle bed reactor of the prior art is<br>
preferably used in prehydrogenation, HDO, hydroisomerization, and<br>
hydrofinishing steps.<br>
Product<br>
The process according to the invention yields a high quality branched and<br>
paraffinic hydrocarbon component suitable as a base oil or base oil component.<br>
The base oil product has excellent viscosity and low temperature properties. The<br><br>
process according to the invention also yields typically as a by-product a branched<br>
and paraffinic hydrocarbon product suitable for diesel fuel pool. The diesel<br>
component contains typically some short carbon-carbon side branches, resulting<br>
in an exceptionally low cloud point and cold filter plugging point but still a good<br>
cetane number. In addition, a hydrocarbon component suitable to be used as a<br>
solvent, gasoline and/or a component of gasoline is obtained as a by-product. All<br>
products are preferably of biological origin.<br>
A branched, saturated and paraffinic hydrocarbon component is the main product<br>
in the process according to the invention, particularly when the ketonisation and<br>
hydrodeoxygenation steps are carried out prior to isomerization. A branched,<br>
saturated and paraffinic hydrocarbon component containing high amounts of<br>
cycloparaffins is obtained when carboxylic (fatty) acids are isomerized prior to the<br>
ketonisation and hydrodeoxygenation steps.<br>
Feedstocks, which are preferably derived from biological starting materials, have<br>
a substantial effect on the composition and distillation range of the product. For<br>
instance feedstocks consisting of fatty acids may be fractionated by distillation to<br>
give narrow fractions to be tailored for various applications. For feedstocks<br>
having hydrocarbon chains of C16, C18, C20 and C22, typical carbon numbers of<br>
products are respectively C31, C35, C39, and C43. Narrow product fractions are<br>
obtained since the distillation range of the product mainly depends on the length<br>
of the hydrocarbon chain of the feedstock. Base oils with narrow distillation<br>
ranges obtained according to the invention have extremely low volatilities when<br>
compared to corresponding products of the prior art.<br>
Carbon number range of the base oil of the invention is extremely narrow,<br>
typically no more than 5 carbons wide. Most typical structures and carbon number<br>
ranges (C31-C35) of the base oils 1 and 2 produced by the process of the<br>
invention (4-6 cSt/100 °C) are presented in Table 2. Carbon number depends on<br><br>
the carbon number of the feedstock. Most typical carbon numbers are shown bold-<br>
faced<br><br>
Base oils of biological origin shown in Table 2 are produced as follows:<br>
1.	Stearic acid fraction is ketonised, hydrodeoxygenated, and hydroisomerized.<br>
2.	Unsaturated fatty acid is isomerized, ketonised, and hydrodeoxygenated.<br>
Using feedstocks with different hydrocarbon chains, the molecular masses of the<br>
products may be increased to reach viscosity ranges required for different<br>
applications by means of the ketonisation reaction. With the process of the<br>
invention, lighter hydrocarbon products such as solvents, gasoline, and diesel<br>
fuels may be produced from feedstocks of shorter hydrocarbon chains.<br>
Saturated hydrocarbons are classified according to the carbon and hydrogen atoms<br>
by field ionization mass spectrometry (FIMS) method as follows:<br><br><br>
In Tables 2 and 3, the percentages (%, by FIMS) refer to the groups of compounds<br>
determined according to said method.<br>
In Table 3 are presented typical carbon number ranges (C25-C35) and<br>
compositions of synthetic (GTL) and mineral oil (VHVI and Slack Wax) base<br>
oils, belonging to the same viscosity class of about 4 - 6 cSt measured at 100 °C.<br>
Structures of naphthenes are examples of different compound types. The average<br>
carbon numbers are shown bold-faced.<br>
Products shown in Table 3 are produced as follows:<br>
1.	GTL is a hydroisomerized Fischer-Tropsch waxy fraction derived from<br>
natural gas<br>
2.	Slack Wax is a hydroisomerized Slack Wax fraction derived from crude oil<br>
3.	VHVI is a hydrocracked and hydroisomerized base oil derived from crude oil<br><br><br><br>
With respect to carbon number and molecular structure, base oils of the invention<br>
differ from products of the prior art, as may be clearly seen from Tables 2 and 3.<br>
In case the isomerization is based on the double bonds of C18 fatty acid skeleton<br>
(structure 2 in Table 1), the structure of the branched, saturated hydrocarbon<br>
product obtained using the process according to the invention is different from the<br>
one obtained for example when hydroisomerizing C25-C35 paraffins in Slack and<br>
GTL waxes. In the present case the branches are mainly in the middle of the long<br>
hydrocarbon chain, due to the common ω9 olefrnic unsaturation positions<br>
responsible of branching. In Slack and GTL waxes (structures 1 and 2 in Table 3),<br><br>
the branches are mainly near the ends of the hydrocarbon main chain. There are<br>
typically alkyl branches having carbon numbers 1 - 4 within the hydrocarbon<br>
chain of the product. With respect to the branching site, the branched components<br>
are mixtures of different isomers. Branches more in the middle of the hydrocarbon<br>
chain lower the pour point considerably more than those at the ends of the chain.<br>
In addition to the location of the branches, also the number of branches affects the<br>
pour point. The pour point being lowered by increasing number of branches, but<br>
at the same time also the viscosity index is reduced. It is known that an optimum<br>
correlation between the viscosity index and pour point is attained with only few<br>
branches present in the main hydrocarbon chain. In the process of the invention<br>
where the isomerization is based on the double bonds of C18 fatty acid skeleton,<br>
the number of branches is limited by the number of double bonds in the feedstock,<br>
and thus the base oil may not be branched too much to cause the VI to be reduced<br>
near the lower limit. In a similar manner, lowering of the pour point is limited by<br>
the number of double bonds in the feedstock.<br>
In case the isomerization is based on hydroisomerization, such as of the<br>
C31/C33/C35 wax of hydrodeoxygenated ketone (structure 1 in Table 1), the<br>
structure of the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product obtained using the<br>
process according to the invention resembles to the one obtained<br>
hydroisomerizing C25-C35 paraffins in SW and GTL wax. In both present cases<br>
of the invention, the length of the hydrocarbon chain is though higher, typically<br>
from C31 to C35 and narrower than those of technically known base oils. Due to<br>
relatively long hydrocarbon main chain and controlled level of branching, the<br>
viscosity and cold properties of the product of invention are very good: the<br>
kinematic viscosity (KV100) is about 5 cSt and VI above 150 even though pour<br>
point is decreased to near -20 °C.<br>
Naphthenes of the final product of the invention are mononaphthenes and non-<br>
fused dinaphthenes. In the Slack wax and VHVI products of the prior art, the<br><br>
dinaphthenes are mainly fused. The VI of fused naphthenes is poorer than that of<br>
non-fused naphthenes. In addition, it is known that the non-fused naphthene rings<br>
are desirable as components of base oils since their VI is reasonably high but the<br>
pour point low. In the VHVI products of the prior art (structure 3 in Table 3), in<br>
addition to mononaphthenes there are polycyclic naphthenes with 3-5 rings<br>
typically not present in the product of the invention. These are formed as a result<br>
of cracking and hydrogenation of naphthenes and aromatic compounds of the<br>
mineral crude oil based feed.<br>
In addition to pour point and viscosity index, the relationship of isoparaffins and<br>
1-2 ring naphthenes to 3-6 ring naphthenes seem to play the major role in cold<br>
cranking. If too high amount of multiring naphthenes are present, they give higher<br>
CCS-30 values since they are present as an extremely viscous liquid. Furthermore,<br>
if normal paraffins are present after hydroisomerization, they give high CCS-30<br>
values by crystallization and thus inhibiting the liquid to flow,<br>
The base oil of biological origin according to the invention comprises a product<br>
produced from starting materials of biological origin. The base oil comprises<br>
branched hydrocarbons having carbon number at least C18. Said product contains<br>
not more than 20 %, preferably not more than 10 %, and particularly preferably<br>
not more than 5 %, by weight, and at best not more than 1 % by weight of linear<br>
paraffins, and at least 90 %, preferably at least 95 %, and particularly preferably at<br>
least 97 %, by weight, and at best 99 % by weight of saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Base oils of the invention comprise mono and dinaphthenes, but no polycyclic<br>
naphthenes, the dinaphthenes thereof being non-fused. Based on the FIMS<br>
analysis, the product of the invention contains mononaphthenes more than 5 %,<br>
preferably 5-20 %, particularly preferably 5- 15 %, and at best 5- 10 %; and less<br>
than 1.0 %, preferably less than 0.5 %, and particularly preferably less than 0.1 %<br>
of polycyclic naphthenes measured by FIMS.<br><br>
For base oils of the invention, having kinematic viscosity KV100 of 4 - 7 mm2/s,<br>
the viscosity index is at least 115 and preferably at least 120, particularly<br>
preferably at least 150, and at best at least 160 (ASTM D 2270) and pour point<br>
lower than -9 °C, preferably lower than -12 °C and particularly preferably lower<br>
than -15 °C (ASTM D 97 / 5950).<br>
Low temperature dynamic viscosity, CCS-30, for base oil is no more than<br>
29.797*(KV100)2,7848 cP, preferably no more than 34.066*(KV100)2.3967 cP; CCS-<br>
35 is no more than 36.108*(KV100)3,069 cP, preferably no more than<br>
50.501 *(KV100)2,4918 cP measured by method ASTM D 5293; pour point being<br>
not over -9 °C, preferably not over -12 °C and particularly preferably not over -15<br>
°C (ASTM D 97 / 5950).<br>
For base oil of the invention the volatility of product, having KV100 from 3 cSt to<br>
8 cSt, is no more than 2271.2*(KV100)-3,5373 % by weight as determined by the<br>
method of DIN 51581-2 (Mathematical Noack method based on ASTM D 2887<br>
GC distillation).<br>
Width of the carbon number range of base oils of the invention is no more than 9<br>
carbons, preferably no more than 7 carbons, particularly preferably no more than<br>
5 carbons, and at best 3 carbons (FIMS). More than about 50 %, preferably more<br>
than 75 % and particularly preferably more than 90 % by weight of the base oil<br>
contain hydrocarbons belonging to this narrow carbon number range.<br>
Distillation range of base oils of the invention is no more than 155 °C, preferably<br>
no more than 100 °C, particularly preferably no more than 70 °C, and at best no<br>
more than 50 °C (determined by the method of ASTM D 2887, distillation points<br>
D10 and D90).<br>
Sulfur content of said base oil of the invention is less than 300 ppm, preferably<br>
less than 50 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm, (ASTM D 3120).<br><br>
Nitrogen content of said base oil of the invention is less than 100 ppm, preferably<br>
less than 10 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm, (ASTM D 4629).<br>
Base oils of the invention, based on biological starting materials, contain carbon<br>
14C isotope, which may be considered as an indication of the use of renewable raw<br>
materials. Typical 14C isotope content (proportion) of the total carbon content in<br>
the product, which is completely of biological origin, is at least 100 %. Carbon<br>
14C isotope content is determined on the basis of radioactive carbon (carbon 14C<br>
isotope) content in the atmosphere in 1950 (ASTM D 6866). 14C isotope content<br>
of the base oil according to the invention is lower in cases where other<br>
components besides biological components are used in the processing of the<br>
product, said proportion being, however, more than 50 %, preferably more than 90<br>
%, particularly preferably more than 99 %. In this way, even low amounts of base<br>
oil of biological origin may be detected in other types of hydrocarbon base oils.<br>
The cetane number of the diesel product obtained with the process of the<br>
invention, is more than 40, preferably more than 55, and particularly preferably<br>
more than 70. It contains more than 60 %, preferably more than 99 % by volume,<br>
of paraffins, and less than 30 %, preferably less than 1 % by volume, of aromatics,<br>
based on the IP-391 method. The product comprises less than 40 %, preferably<br>
less than 10 %, by weight, of linear n-paraffms. The cloud point of the diesel<br>
component is less than 0 °C, preferably less than -15 °C, and particularly less than<br>
-30 °C. Typically, the diesel product obtained is totally of biological origin. In the<br>
product of the invention, there are branches formed by carbon-carbon bonds, this<br>
structure resulting in a very low cloud point.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The process of the invention allows particularly for the use of renewable starting<br>
materials of biological origin, containing heteroatoms, for producing base oils, but<br>
also diesel and gasoline components. In addition to traditional crude oil, a<br><br>
completely new raw material source for high-quality branched paraffinic base oils<br>
is provided according to the invention. Also carbon dioxide emissions<br>
contributing to the greenhouse effect may be reduced by using renewable raw<br>
material sources instead of non-renewable ones.<br>
According to the process of the invention, base oil containing only carbon and<br>
hydrogen is obtained, the stability of said base oil in humid conditions being<br>
higher than that of esters or other base oils containing heteroatoms. A paraffinic<br>
hydrocarbon component is not decomposed as easily as esters that form corrosive<br>
acids. A nonpolar and fully saturated hydrocarbon component free of sulfur is<br>
obtained using the process of the invention by removing oxygen of ketones, and<br>
the heteroatoms of any impurities of the feedstock in the HDO step. In the<br>
isomerization step, the carbon chain is branched, thus improving low temperature<br>
properties, that is, the pour point is lowered, low-temperature fluidity enhanced<br>
and filterability at low temperatures is improved. Solid wax is converted to oily<br>
hydrocarbon having viscosity index (viscosity-temperature-dependence) very<br>
suitable for top-tier base oils without blending limitations, and further, it is<br>
compatible with lubricant additives.<br>
With the process of the invention, high-quality saturated base oil having a low<br>
pour point may be produced, said base oil being also very useful at low<br>
temperature conditions. The product is typically free of sulfur, the viscosity index<br>
thereof being preferably at least 120, and thus it may also be suitably used in<br>
applications of Group HI base oils.<br>
Composition, properties and boiling range of the product are also strongly<br>
influenced by the starting material of biological origin. The starting material may<br>
be distilled to fractions according to carbon numbers. According to the invention,<br>
branched paraffinic base oil having narrow boiling ranges and different physical<br>
properties may be processed from these fractions. Typical carbon number ranges<br>
of the product components are as follows: gas C1-C4, gasoline C5-C10, diesel<br><br>
C11-C26, and base oil having carbon number of at least C18. Distillation range of<br>
base oil produced from a feedstock having a single carbon number is the<br>
narrowest.<br>
Narrow distillation range indicates that the product does not contain initial light<br>
fraction, meaning molecules considerably lighter than the average, which can be<br>
seen as decreased volatility of the product, resulting in reduced emissions and<br>
reduced use of lubricants in practical applications. The "tail" composed of the<br>
heavier components, meaning molecules considerably heavier than the average, is<br>
also missing from the product. This results in excellent low temperature properties<br>
of the product.<br>
For the base oil of the invention, the carbon number and distillation range are<br>
governed by the feedstock composition. For base oils of the prior art, the<br>
distillation range is adjusted by distilling the product to obtain a fraction having<br>
the desired kinematic viscosity. It is preferable that lubricants have base oils with<br>
narrow carbon number distribution and thus narrow distillation range, so that<br>
lubricating oils contain molecules of similar sizes behaving in a similar way under<br>
different conditions.<br>
The base oil according to the invention has high viscosity index, which leads to a<br>
significantly decreased need of high price Viscosity Index Improver (VII) or in<br>
other terms Viscosity Modifier (VM). It is commonly known, that the VII is an<br>
additive, which causes highest amount of deposits in vehicle engines. In addition,<br>
reduction of the amounts of VII results in significant savings in costs.<br>
Also, because the base oil is non-toxic, contains no sulfur, nitrogen or aromatic<br>
compounds typically present in the conventional mineral oil based products, it<br>
may more safely be used in applications where the end user is exposed to oil or oil<br>
spray.<br><br>
Moreover, response of the base oil according to the invention is extremely high<br>
for antioxidants and pour point depressants, and thus the life time of the<br>
lubricating oils are longer and they can be used in the colder environment than<br>
lubricants based on the conventional base oils.<br>
Even though the branched, saturated hydrocarbon product is produced from<br>
saturated and unsaturated natural fatty acids, it contains no oxygen, and thus its<br>
hydro lytic stability is much higher than that of synthetic ester base oils. Due to the<br>
lack of ester bonds, also the formation of acidic degradation products is<br>
minimized. In addition, the oxidation stability of the saturated base oil is higher<br>
than that of ester base oil containing unsaturated fatty acid structural units.<br>
Compared to esters, the base oil of the invention is more compatible with<br>
conventional base oils derived from crude oil, base oils obtained from Fischer-<br>
Tropsch process, and with hydrocarbon base oils, as well with lubricant additives.<br>
Moreover, it is compatible with elastomers, and thus it can be used in modern<br>
vehicle engines without modifications.<br>
An additional advantage of the base oil according to this invention is that it fulfils<br>
the API group III base oil specifications. Therefore it can be used in engine oil<br>
formulations like other group III base oils according the same interchanging rules<br>
without need to perform new engine tests.<br>
The base oil of the invention is preferably based on renewable natural resources.<br>
Starting materials of the process of the invention are available all over the world,<br>
and moreover, the utilization of the process is not limited by significant initial<br>
investments in contrast for instance to the GTL technology.<br>
The products of the inventive process are carbon dioxide neutral with respect to<br>
the use and disposal thereof, that is, they will not increase the carbon dioxide load<br>
of the atmosphere in contrast to products derived from fossil starting materials.<br><br>
Further advantages of the invention relate to diesel fuel component of biological<br>
origin, which has excellent low temperature properties and cetane number<br>
compared to those of solutions of the prior art, where components based on fatty<br>
acid methyl esters are used. Problems associated with low temperature properties<br>
have been avoided by isomerizing waxy n-paraffms derived from fatty acids to<br>
give isoparaffins.<br>
The middle distillate diesel fuel component obtained is a high-quality<br>
hydrocarbon component of biological origin particularly suitable as a component<br>
for diesel fuel, as isoparaffinic solvent, and as lamp oil, the cetane number thereof<br>
being even above 70, the cloud point being as low as below -30 °C. Fouling of the<br>
engine may be expected to be reduced in comparison to fuels of biological origin<br>
already known in the art, said fuels containing incompletely burning ester<br>
components. Moreover, the density of the composition is lower. The composition<br>
requires no changes of the automobile technology or logistics. Higher energy<br>
content of the biological component per unit volume compared to products based<br>
on esters may also be mentioned as an advantage.<br>
With the optional prehydrogenation step side reactions of double bonds of<br>
hydrocarbon chains may be reduced. Side reactions, such as polymerization, ring<br>
formation and aromatization cause coke formation on the catalyst, thus reducing<br>
its service life. Ring formation and polymerization change also viscosity<br>
properties of the hydrocarbon components. Moreover, said prehydrogenation<br>
results in improved yields of the final base oil product.<br>
In addition to hydrocarbon chain lengthening also oxygen may be removed from<br>
the feedstock as carbon dioxide with the ketonization reaction, which is favorable<br>
for the process to minimize hydrogen consumption. With the isomerization, low<br>
temperature properties of the product may be improved without interfering with<br>
viscosity properties.<br><br>
With the solution of the invention, high hydrogen partial pressure may be<br>
maintained throughout the whole process, and keep levels of impurities low.<br>
Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water contents may be lowered to such an<br>
extent that light stripping in the HDO stage or in a separate gas/liquid separation<br>
vessel is sufficient to remove residual impurities prior to isomerization.<br>
Advantages of the invention also include protection of the isomerization catalyst,<br>
thus preventing the deactivation thereof.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon components produced with the process<br>
according to the invention are excellent, and moreover, distillation ranges of<br>
products produced from fatty acids with a specific carbon number are<br>
considerably narrower that those of VHVI base oils. The products are well suited<br>
as base oils without blending limitations, and further, the products are also<br>
compatible with lubricant additives.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention is now illustrated by means of the following examples without<br>
wishing to limit the scope of the invention thereby. Properties of the hydrocarbon<br>
components prepared in the examples are presented in Table 4. Similarly,<br>
properties of some of the base oils of the prior art are shown in Table 5. It is<br>
however clear that the invention is not limited to embodiments described in the<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from stearic acid fraction<br>
(C17H35COOH)<br><br>
A mixture of plant oils (linseed, soybean, and rapeseed oils) was pretreated by<br>
hydrolysis and distillation to obtain fatty acid fractions according to carbon<br>
numbers. The C18 acid fraction thus obtained was used as the feed, the fraction<br>
being diluted with a paraffinic diesel fuel of biological origin. C18 acid content of<br>
the feedstock thus obtained was 31 %, by weight Double bonds of the feedstock<br>
were selectively prehydrogenated, and the stearic acid was continuously ketonised<br>
at atmospheric pressure, in a tubular reactor using a MnO2 catalyst. Temperature<br>
of the reactor was 370 °C, the WHSV of total feed being 3 1/h. 22 % by weight of<br>
18-pentatriacontanone, or stearone, in a diluent was obtained as the ketonisation<br>
product.<br>
In the next step, the stearone/diluent mixture obtained above was<br>
hydrodeoxygenated in a high pressure Parr reactor using a dried and activated<br>
NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, to give linear paraffins. The ketone was hydrogenated at<br>
330 °C, under a pressure of 5 MPa, mixing at 300 rpm until no ketone peak was<br>
detected in the FTTR spectrum. 71 % by weight of linear C35 paraffin was<br>
obtained from stearic acid.<br>
The paraffin wax obtained above was isomerized in a Parr reactor to give a<br>
branched paraffin of the base oil class using a reduced Pt molecular sieve/Al2O3<br>
catalyst. Preheated mixture of the paraffin/diluent was isomerized under a<br>
hydrogen pressure of 3 MPa and at 340 °C until a pour point of -6 °C was<br>
obtained. Finally, light fractions were distilled from the product at reduced<br>
pressure, followed by finishing of the paraffinic product by filtering through<br>
kieselguhr. Hydrocarbon components may be produced in a similar way from<br>
other fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from fatty acids derived from palm oil<br><br>
Palm oil was hydrolyzed. Fatty acids derived from palm oil were used as the<br>
feedstock following selective prehydrogenation of the double bonds of said fatty<br>
acids. After hydrogenation, the fatty acid composition was as follows: C14 1 %,<br>
C16 44 %, C18 54 %, and C20 1 %, all percentages being by weight. The fatty<br>
acids were ketonised as in Example 1. Following ketonization, the solvent was<br>
distilled off, yielding a product with the following composition: C15COC15<br>
ketone, 10.4 %, C15COC17 ketone, 42.1 %, and C17COC17 ketone, 43.6 %, by<br>
weight.<br>
The ketone mixture obtained from the ketonisation stage was hydrodeoxygenated<br>
in a Parr reactor using a dried and activated N1Mo/Al2O3 catalyst to give linear<br>
paraffins. Hydrodeoxygenation was carried out under a pressure of 3.3 MPa, at<br>
330 °C, mixing at 300 rpm. Linear paraffin with the composition: C33 chain 41.8<br>
%, C34 chain 2.1 %, and C35 chain 43.8 % by weight was obtained from palm<br>
oil.<br>
The linear paraffin wax obtained in the HDO step was isomerized in a Parr reactor<br>
to give branched paraffins of the base oil class using a reduced Pt molecular<br>
sieve/Al2O3 catalyst. Isomerization was performed at 340 °C, under a hydrogen<br>
pressure of 3 MPa until the pour point of the product was below -15 °C. Finally,<br>
light fractions were distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
Palm oil also contains C16 and C18 fatty acids, the hydrocarbon component thus<br>
having a wider distillation range and a lower kinematic viscosity compared to the<br>
product of Example 1. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a<br>
similar way from other plant and fish oils, and animal fats.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from methyl esters of fatty acids derived<br>
from animal fats<br><br>
Purified animal fat was transesterified under basic conditions with methanol at 70<br>
°C, under a pressure of 0.1 MPa, in the presence of a sodium methoxide catalyst<br>
in two steps, thus producing methyl esters of fatty acids. The reaction mixture was<br>
purified by washing with acid and water, and the mixture of fatty acid methyl<br>
esters was dried The fatty acid composition of the mixture of methyl esters<br>
derived from animal fat was as follows: C14:0 2 %; C16:0 23 %, C16:l 3 %,<br>
C18r0 13 %, C18:l 40 %, C18:2 11 %, C18:3 1 % by weight.<br>
The mixture of fatty acid methyl esters obtained above was used as the feedstock<br>
of the process, diluted with paraffinic diesel of biological origin. The fatty acid<br>
methyl ester content of the feedstock was 30 % by weight, the feedstock being<br>
continuously ketonised in a tubular reaction as described in Example 1. Both<br>
saturated and unsaturated ketones were obtained as the product. Their carbon<br>
numbers were as follows: 10 % of C21-C28 ketones, 3 % of C29 ketone, 10 % of<br>
C31 ketone, 33 % of C33 ketone, and 20 % by weight of C35 ketone.<br>
The ketone mixture was first hydrodeoxygenated a Parr reactor as described in<br>
Example 2, followed by isomerization according to Example 2. Hydrocarbon<br>
components may also be produced in a similar manner from methyl esters derived<br>
from plant and fish oils. Service life of the ketonization catalyst may be extended<br>
by using less corrosive methyl esters instead of fatty acids.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from metal stearates<br>
A metal stearate (CH3(CH2)16COO)2Mg was ketonised under atmospheric<br>
pressure in a Parr reactor at 340 °C and with mixing rate of 300 rpm. Stearone, or<br>
C35 ketone, obtained as the product was hydrodeoxygenated and isomerized as<br>
described in Example 1. The product thus obtained correspond the product of<br>
Example 1. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar manner<br>
from other metal salts of fatty acids derived from plant oils, animal fats and fish<br><br>
oils, as well as from metal salts of fatty acids obtained by saponification of plant<br>
and fish oils or animal fats. No special catalyst is needed for the ketonization in<br>
case metal salts are used.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from carboxylic acids of tall oil<br>
Distilled tall oil fatty acids were isomerized in a Parr high-pressure reactor with<br>
mordenite type zeolite. Tall oil fatty acids, 5 wt-% of the catalyst and 3 wt-% of<br>
water, calculated of total reaction mixture, were placed in a reactor and air was<br>
removed from the autoclave with purging nitrogen. The mixture was stirred with<br>
300 rpra The reactor was heated to 280 °C and kept under nitrogen atmosphere of<br>
1.8 MPa for 6 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture obtained was taken from<br>
the autoclave, and the zeolite was filtered off. The filtrate was distilled under<br>
reduced pressure to yield monomelic acids.<br>
The monomelic acids thus obtained were placed in an autoclave, and double<br>
bonds were hydrogenated at 150 °C with a catalyst containing 5 wt-% Pd on<br>
carbon under hydrogen atmosphere of 2 MPa until the reaction was complete.<br>
Catalyst amount was 2 wt-% of monomeric acid. Then, the reaction mixture was<br>
cooled, and the catalyst was filtered off.<br>
The obtained crude branched chain fatty acids were subjected to a conventional<br>
solvent fractionation procedure to yield isomerized fatty acids. To the crude<br>
branched chain fatty acids, about 2-fold amount by weight of hexane was added.<br>
After this mixture was cooled to -15 °C, the resulting crystals of non-isomerized<br>
fatty acids were filtered off. Then, the hexane was distilled off from the filtrate to<br>
yield purified isomerized fatty acids.<br>
The isostearic acid was diluted with a paraffinic diesel of biological origin in a<br>
ratio of 30/70 %, by weight. The mixture thus obtained was continuously<br><br>
ketonised at atmospheric pressure in a tubular reactor using a MnO2 catalyst. The<br>
temperature of the reactor was 370 °C, the WHSV being 1.7. A mixture of<br>
isomerized ketones was obtained as the product.<br>
The mixture of isomerized ketones was hydrogenated in a HDO step in a Parr<br>
reactor as in Example 2. Solvents were distilled from the final product under<br>
reduced pressure. Thereafter, the product was subjected to solvent dewaxing to<br>
remove linear paraffins, and finally, the paraffinic product was finished by<br>
filtering through kieselguhr. Mainly branched paraffins were obtained as the final<br>
product. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar way from<br>
other isomerized fatty acids or from isomerized methyl esters of fatty acids of<br>
plant, animal and fish origin.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from tall oil fatty acids and dicarboxylic<br>
acids<br>
Distilled mixture of fatty acids from tall oil was isomerized and prehydrogenated<br>
as described in Example 5. The isostearic acid fraction thus obtained and the C6<br>
dicarboxylic acid (adipic acid) were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:3, and the mixture<br>
was ketonised under atmospheric pressure in a Parr reactor using a MgO catalyst<br>
at 340 °C, with mixing rate of 300 rpm.<br>
The ketone mixture was hydrogenated in the HDO step in a Parr reactor as in<br>
Example 1, and light fractions were separated by distillation from the final<br>
product under reduced pressure. In comparison to other Examples, branched<br>
paraffins having longer chains were obtained as products. Hydrocarbon<br>
components may also be produced in a similar manner from other fatty acids or<br>
fatty acid methyl esters of plant, animal and fish origin and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
Either the fatty acids, or alternatively the wax obtained after ketonisation and<br>
hydrodeoxygenation may be subjected to isomerization.<br><br><br><br><br>
HC-CDW = hydrocracked, catalytically dewaxed base oil<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from tatty acids derived from palm oil<br>
Palm oil was hydroIyzed. Fatty acids derived from palm oil were used as the<br>
feedstock following selective prehydrogenation of the double bonds of said fatty<br>
acids. The fatty acids were vaporized with nitrogen purge in a separate vaporizer<br>
unit and ketonised continuously at atmospheric pressure, in a tubular reactor using<br>
a MnO2 as catalyst. Temperature of the reactor was 380 °C, the WHSV of the feed<br>
being 1 1/h-l.<br>
The C31, C33, C35 ketone mixture obtained from the ketonisation stage was<br>
hydrodeoxygenated continuously in a tubular fixed bed reactor using a dried and<br>
activated NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to give linear paraffins. Hydrodeoxygenation was<br><br>
carried out under a pressure of 4 MPa (40 bar), at 270 °C and with WHSV of 1<br>
1/h.<br>
The linear paraffin wax obtained in the HDO step was isomerized continuously in<br>
a tubular fixed bed reactor using a reduced Pt molecular sieve/Al2O3 catalyst to<br>
give branched paraffins using a reduced Pt molecular sieve/Al2O3 catalyst.<br>
Isomerization was performed at 340 °C, under a hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa until<br>
the pour point of the product was below -15 °C. Finally, light fractions were<br>
distilled under reduced pressure and separated.<br>
Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar way from other plant<br>
and fish oils, and animal fats.<br><br><br><br>
Example 8<br>
Determination of the biological origin of the hydrocarbon component<br>
Hydrocarbon component of biological origin was weighed into mineral oil based<br>
Group III base oil, and mixed thoroughly. For the first sample, 0.5014 g of the<br>
hydrocarbon component of biological origin was weighed, and base oil<br>
component of the Group III was added in an amount to obtain a total weight of<br>
10.0000 g; for the second sample, 1.0137 g of the hydrocarbon component of<br>
biological origin was weighed, and base oil component of the Group III was<br>
added in an amount to obtain a total weight of 10.0232 g. The measured results<br>
are summarized in Table 7 below. Content of radioactive carbon (14C isotope) is<br>
expressed as "percent modern carbon", based on the content of radioactive carbon<br>
of the atmosphere in 1950. At present, the content of radioactive carbon of the<br>
atmosphere is about 107 %. 813 C value shows the ratio of stable carbon isotopes<br>
13C/l2C. By means of this value, the isotope fractionation found in our process<br>
may be corrected. Actual results are presented in the last column.<br><br><br>
Example 8<br>
Carbon number distribution<br>
The proportion of hydrocarbons in certain carbon number range of the base oil<br>
product is dependent on distillation. In Figure 3 the carbon number distributions<br>
of VHVI (413-520 °C cut) and the baseoils of invention (360-°C cut) are shown.<br>
The carbon number distribution of the base oils according to invention is narrower<br>
than that of conventional base oils when distillation is cut in similar manner at &gt;<br>
413 °C corresponding to C26 paraffin. In addition to the narrow carbon number<br>
distribution, the baseoils of the invention contain also higher amount of higher<br>
boiling fractions compared to the conventional product of same viscosity range<br>
(KV100 about 4 cSt), as shown in Figure 3. The lower boiling components with<br>
carbon number 
compounds enhance VI.<br><br>
