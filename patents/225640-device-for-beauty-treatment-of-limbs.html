BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 4, numeral 1 indicates the device for beauty treatment of limbs<br>
of the present invention, which is provided with:<br>
a first support 2 for at least one hand, foot or other body portions, fit to allow an operator<br>
to work on said hand with tools, products and material;<br>
aspirator means 3 capable to suck air with powders and/or with vapors of products used<br>
for the beauty treatment of hand and to reintroduce the purified air in the environment;<br>
a set of lamps 4 for the treatment of hand or products applied to the hand;<br>
a timer 5 to fix at least the lighting time of lamps 4,<br>
In an operating condition P in which base means 6 of device 1, consisting for instance of feet<br>
with rubber plugs, mate a nearly flat and horizontal surface, for instance a work table<br>
surface, the aspirator means 3 is positioned below the first support 2 an edge 7 thereof is<br>
close and facing a portion of aspirator means 3.<br>
The first support 2 has a convex shape and a surface adequate for supporting two hands or<br>
feet with the fingernails positioned at said edge 7 and therefore facing the aspirator means 3<br>
that comprise a motorized fan 8 associated to filtering means 9 for instance including actived<br>
. carbon and porous paper to stop powders or vapors produced by filing or painting the nails.<br>
In the operating condition P, the upper portion of filtering means 9 defines a second support<br>
10 almost horizontal and eventually usable for objects, such as brushes or spatulas, soaked<br>
with nail varnish or fresh resins.<br>
The lamps 4 are preferably four of number and they are housed in a cavity 11, for at least a<br>
hand and carried out in the back portion of device, below the first support 2.<br>
The invention provides that one or more lamps 4 are inclined for a uniform illumination of<br>
the nails.<br>
The lamps 4 have an emission of light, for instance ultraviolet, with spectrum suitable for the<br>
polymerization or hardening of products applied to the fingernails or fit for beauty treatment<br>
of skin or fingernails.<br>
The device 1 includes two removable containers 12, housed in respective seats carried out at<br>
the side of and under the first support 2, for the products used for beauty treatment of hand,<br>
for instance water, creams or other.<br>
The device 1 is also provided with support means 13 for the wrist adjacent to removable<br>
containers 12 in such a way that a person can hold the fingers in the containers 12 without<br>
efforts.<br>
A couple of handles 16, extending from the first support 2 allow easily moving the device so<br>
making easier the transport thereof.<br>
In order to make easier to remove nail varnishes, resins and the like from the fingernails or to<br>
remove false fingernails, the device 1 include ultrasonic means, known and not shown, for<br>
instance including piezoelectric crystals associated to respective containers, not shown, for a<br>
liquid such as water or a solvent, in which to dip the fingers. It is also provided that said<br>
containers may consist of the removable containers 12.<br>
A timer 5 controls the ultrasonic means in order to regulate the duration of the ultrasonic<br>
emission.<br>
The body parts of device 1 are preferably made of plastic material by injection molding.<br>
A possible operation of device 1 provides that an operator effects beauty treatment, for<br>
instance manicure of hands or feet positioned on the first support 2 whose convex shape is<br>
comfortable both for the customer and for the operator. The possible powder, for instance<br>
generated by filing the natural or false nails, is sucked and retained by the aspirator means 3.<br>
The removal of old nail varnishes or false nails can also be facilitated by dipping the<br>
fingernails in the liquid of the container of the ultrasonic means in an activation condition<br>
thereof by the timer 5.<br>
The application of nail varnishes, resins and similar is carried out on the fingernails of hands<br>
positioned on the first support 2 in such a way that the vapors and the produced gases, are<br>
sucked by the aspirator means 3.<br>
The position of fingers in the cavity 11, in an activation condition of lamps 4 by the timer 5;<br>
allows obtaining a fast hardening of nail varnish or resin applied to the nails.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 show a variant of the device for beauty treatment of limbs of the present<br>
invention, which includes a switchboard 20 provided with three on-off push buttons 21, one<br>
power supply jack 22 and one rheostat 23 for controlling the electric power at jack 22. Said<br>
power is delivered by a supply transformer, of known type and not shown in the figures,<br>
which is provided for powering external tools and means such as a cutter.<br>
The variant further comprises an eyelid portion 24 at the upper external edge of cavity 11<br>
which protects the lamps 4 against collisions and impacts and hinged portions 25 of the<br>
device side walls, which can be opened for reaching an inner volume of device 1 fit for<br>
storage of beauty treatment products.<br>
Another variant of the device, which is not shown in the figures, includes inner fan means,<br>
whose outlet flows into the cavity 11 and which are fit for drying and hardening the products<br>
applied to the fingernails, and a drawer means for containing products for treatment use<br>
which can be extracted from the cavity 11.<br>
The main advantage of the present invention is to provide a device for beauty treatment of<br>
hand, which is portable and fit to allow an operator to perform a sequence of several<br>
treatment operations of hand in a fast and rational way. <br>
Other advantage is to provide a device fit to suck and to purify fumes and gases produced by<br>
nail varnishes and the like applied to the fingernails and to facilitate the application, the<br>
hardening and the removal of said nail varnishes.<br>
