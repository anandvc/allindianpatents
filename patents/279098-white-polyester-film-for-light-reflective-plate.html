DESCRIPTION<br>
WHITE POLYESTER FILM FOR LIGHT REFLECTIVE PLATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD        ,    ■<br>
The present invention relates to a white polyester fiWfor a light<br>
reflective plate.    Particularly, the present invention relates to a white polyester film for a liquid crystal display reflective plate used.in reflective plates for relatively compact reverse prism type liquid crystal "[displays such as laptop computers and mobile phones, for side light type liquid crystal<br>
displays using conventional BEF systems, and for direct type liquid crystal displays such as flat-screen televisions.    Furthermore, the present<br>
invention relates to a super-white polyester film having an excellent reflective property of blue light.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a light source for liquid crystal displays, light sources of a backlight type in which light is irradiated from a backside of a display and a light reflective film described in Patent document 1 are heretofore widely used because they have an advantage that they are low-profile and can illuminate uniformly.    When they are used, it is necessary to place a light<br>
■F	II<br>
reflective plate on the backside of a screen in order to prevent the escape of<br>
illuminating light to the backside of a screen.    Since a small thickness and a high reflective property of light are required for this light reflective plate,<br>
white films whitened by containing fine air bubbles within the film and reflecting light at the interface of the air bubble are principally used as a<br>
 <br>
light reflective plate.<br>
Formation of the fine air bubbles is achieved by dispersing a non-compatible polymer having a high-melting point finely in'a film base material, for example polyester, and stretching (e.g., biaxial stretching) the resulting film.    Voids (air bubbles) are formed around this non-compatible polymer particles during this stretching, and the void exhibits an effect on light reflection, and therefore the film can be whitened and a high reflectance can be attained (Patent document 2).    Light reflected off the reflective plate is diffused and light other than light having upward directivity is reflected by a prism, and the reflection is repeated between the reflective plate and the prism, and light is ultimately sent to a liquid crystal cell in a state in which the directivity of light is enhanced.    In this case, if reflection efficiency of the reflective plate is low or there are factors which cause light leakage or light decay in a system, since optical loss is produced during repetition of the reflection to deteriorate energy efficiency, the brightness of a screen is lowered or economy is deteriorated. '!<br>
Further, the light reflective plate is requested to reflect all color (wavelength) of light uniformly from the viewpoint of color reproducibility of a display.<br>
i<br>
Furthermore, in order to prevent yellowing of the film due to ultraviolet rays emitted from a cold cathode ray tube, a white film prepared by laminating an ultraviolet absorbing layer is proposed (Patent documents 3 and 4).<br>
In these white films, various methods for improving properties on the brightness are disclosed.    For example, for the purpose of improving the<br>
 <br>
brightness in an edge light type, a method in which a light-shielding layer is provided on the film surface opposite to a light source is disclosed (Patent<br>
!|<br>
document 5).    Further, a method, in which Ught diffuseness is controlled by<br>
ii selecting a difference in refractive indexes between a spherical particle and<br>
a binder and front brightness is improved by a light diffusion sheet, is<br>
disclosed (Patent document 6).    Further, a method, in which brightness<br>
unevenness of a backlight is improved by controlling the diffuseness of a<br>
film surface on the light source side in a reflective sheet in a direct backlight,<br>
is disclosed (Patent document 7).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
Problem to be solved by the Invention<br>
As one method for enhancing the reflection efficiency of the light<br>
i<br>
reflective plate, there is a technique in which number of voids per unit area is increased by increasing a thickness of the white film.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A film of the present invention desirably has a thickness of 200 |im or more.    When the thickness is less than 200 (im, preferable iwavelength<br>
dependency of spectral reflectance is relatively easily attained but an<br>
t absolute reflectance is hardly attained.    The thickness is preferably 225<br>
u.m, and more preferably 300 um.    Further, when the thickness is more<br>
than 500 urn, a weigh of a panel may be increased when the film is<br>
incorporated into the liquid crystal display.<br>
In at least one side (side A) of the film of the present invention, M<br>
satisfies a relationship of M 
dependency of spectral reflectance at a wavelength of 450 to 600 nm is<br>
approximated according to the following approximation formula R:<br>
R = MxX + B,<br>
in which R is an approximation formula by a least square method and<br>
represents a light reflectance (%), X represents a wavelength of light (nm),<br>
M represents a wavelength coefficient (%/nm), and B represents a constant<br>
 <br>
(%).<br>
M satisfies preferably a relationship of M  -0.060 (%/nm) because the light reflective plate is requested to reflect all color (wavelength) of light uniformly from the viewpoint of color<br>
. i<br>
reproducibility of a display.   iM satisfies furthermore preferably a relationship of M ^ -0.050 (%/nm).    The film satisfying a relationship of a wavelength coefficient M 
In the present invention, one of methods for satisfying a relationship of M 
Light is scattered/absorbed by impurities, metal components (catalyst), unsaturated bonds and the like in the reflective film and loses energy in its process.    In this time, a part of scattered light is consumed<br>
within the reflective film and becomes a component not contributing to the<br>
I<br>
brightness of a screen.    Its effect increases as a wavelength becomes short<br>
u and a short wavelength region of the spectral reflectance becomes relatively<br>
low.<br>
Then, the slope M can fall within the region by adjusting the degree<br>
of purity of polymer, metal components (catalyst), and color tone of polymer.<br>
Herein, the degree of purity of polymer refers to a quantity of unsaturated<br>
bond in a polymer and a polymer having less unsaturated bond is preferably<br>
used in the film of the present invention.    Further, the metal components<br>
 <br>
(catalyst) comprise the following element group.    Examples of the metal components (catalyst) include compounds using an element group of Sb, K, P, Mg, Li, Ca, Ge and Ti, but preferably, the amounts of the components are so small that polymerization of polymer may not be affected.<br>
As for color tone of the polymer, in color tone of material chips, a polymer having a high L value (brightness) and a low b value (degree of yellow) is preferably used.    By reducing these light-scattering/absorbing components, a reflectance in a short wavelength region becomes relatively high and a slope M becomes small.    The reflectance in a short wavelength region is improved as the slope M becomes small, and this contributes to the improvement in the brightness of a screen.<br>
In the present invention, it is necessary that an estimated reflectance R560 obtained by substitution of X = 560 into the approximation formula be 100% or more in at least one side of the film.    When the<br>
estimated reflectance is less than 100%, the brightness as backlights of a<br>
I side light type liquid crystal display or a direct type liquid crystal display is<br>
|<br>
deteriorated.	!j<br>
i| In order to make the R560 100% or more, it is important that the<br>
film be whitened by containing fine voids within the film, as describe below,<br>
and when number of voids is increased, the reflectance R560 can be<br>
improved.    The reflectance R560 is preferably 102% or more, and more<br>
preferably 104% or more.    There is not an upper limit on the reflectance<br>
R560, but the reflectance R560 is preferably 110% or less because it is<br>
necessary to increase an addition amount of the void nucleus for increasing<br>
the reflectance R560 and in that case, a film forming property may become<br>
 <br>
unstable.<br>
In one aspect of the film of the present invention, a gloss level (60 degrees) of at least one side (side A) is preferably 100% or more.    The gloss level is more preferably 115% or more, and furthermore preferably 120% or more.    When the gloss level is less than 100%, light is scattered, and therefore a part of the scattered light proceeds to an angle region where light is all reflected within a film, and it cannot escape from the film to decay until the light is scattered again.<br>
In order to make the gloss level 100% or more, it is important that number of inorganic or organic particles contained in the film be decreased. If the inorganic or organic particles having particle sizes similar to wavelengths of visible light are present in the vicinity of the film surface, the gloss level is reduced below 100%.    Further, in many cases, since these<br>
particles have refractive indexes which are different from that of the film,<br>
I light is also scattered within the film.    This effect is significant in light of<br>
i. short wavelength and it is not preferable in the present invention that a<br>
large amount of particles be present within the film.<br>
Further, in another aspect of the film of the present invention, it is<br>
preferable to form a surface in which a gloss level at an incident angle of 60<br>
degrees is 70% or less.    Particularly, in the side light type backlight, since<br>
i<br>
the incident angle of light is shallow, light needs to be diffused forward. And so, it is possible to preferably apply a surface in which a gloss level at an incident angle of 60 degrees is 70% or less by a method of controlling surface roughness.    Examples of the method of controlling surface roughness include a method of adding particles having a refractive index<br>
 <br>
close to that of a film matrix resin, and a method of thinning a layer A' to a thickness of 0.1 to 3 am.    When the layer A' is thinned, if a layer B is a layer including voids, the interface of the layer B becomes a rough surface due to the presence of the void and this rough interface resulting from the voids of the layer B can affect the layer A' to change the surface roughness. The thickness of the layer A' is preferably 0.5 to 2 fim, and more preferably 0.8 to 1.5 urn.<br>
Polyester constituting the present invention is a polymer prepared from diol and dicarboxylic acid by polycondensation.    Representative examples of the dicarboxylic acids include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, and sebacic acid, and representative examples of diol include ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, and cyclohexane dimethanol. Specific examples of the Polyesters include polymethylene terephthalate, polytetramethylene terephthalate, polyethylene-p'oxybenzoaie,<br>
!!<br>
poly(l,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate), and	i]<br>
poly ethylene-2,6-nap hthalenedicarboxylate.    In the present invention,<br>
particularly, polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate are<br>
preferable.<br>
Naturally, these polyesters may be a homopolyester or a copolyester,<br>
and examples of the copolymer components include diol components such as<br>
I diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol and polyalkylene glycol; and dicarboxylic<br>
acid components such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic<br>
acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and 5'sodium sulfoisophthalic acid.<br>
if Further, known various additives such as antioxidants and<br>
 <br>
II<br>
antistatic agents may be added to this polyester.    As the polyester used in<br>
the present invention, polyethylene terephthalate is preferable.    A<br>
I polyethylene terephthalate film is superior in water resistance, durability<br>
and chemical resistance.<br>
The film of the present invention is preferably whitened by<br>
containing fine air bubbles within the film.    Formation of the fine air<br>
bubbles is preferably achieved by dispersing a high-melting point polymer<br>
which is non-compatible with polyester finely in a film base material, for<br>
example polyester, and stretching (e.g., biaxial stretching) thertresulting<br>
film.    Voids (air bubbles) are formed around this non-compatible polymer<br>
particles upon this stretching, and the void generates a difference in refractive indexes between the resin and the air layer to reflect light, and<br>
■i	l<br>
therefore the film can be whitened and a high reflectance can.be attained.<br>
-	I<br>
The polymer non-compatible:with polyester (hereinafter, sometimes<br>
abbreviated as non-compatible polymer) is, for example, a polymer having a<br>
melting point of 180°C or higher, selected from poly-3-methylbutene-l,<br>
poly4-methylpentene-1, polyvinyH-butane,<br>
l,4-trans-poly-2,3-dimethylbutadiene, polyvinylcyclohexane, polystyrene,<br>
polymethylstyrene, polydimethylstyrene, polyfluorostyrene,<br>
poly-2-methyl-4-fluorostyrene, polyvinyl t-butyl ether, cellulose triacetate,<br>
cellulose tripropionate, polyvinyl fluoride, amorphous polyolefin, cyclic<br>
olefins copolymer resin, and jpolychlorotrifluoroethylene.    Among them,<br>
polyolefms, particularly polymethylpentene and cyclic olefin, are preferable<br>
for the polyester base material.    Cyclic olefins copolymer resin is a<br>
copolymer of ethylene and at least one cyclic olefin selected from the group<br>
 <br>
consisting of bicycloalkenes and tricycloalke'nes.<br>
An addition amount of the non-compatible polymer (e.g., polyolefin) is preferably 5% by weight or more and 40% by weight or less, -taking an amount of the whole layer containing the non-compatible polymer as.100% by weight.    The addition amount is more preferably 10% by weight or more and 30% by weight or less, and furthermore preferably 15% by weight or more and 25% by weight or less.    When the addition amount is less than 5% by weight, an effect of whitening becomes low and a high reflectance is hardly attained, and when the addition amount is more than 25% by weight, mechanical properties such as strength of a film itself may become too small and there causes a problem that the film is apt to break in stretching and therefore productivity is deteriorated.    With respect to a relationship between the addition amount of the non-compatible polymer and optical properties, number of void nucleuses increases and number of void layers increases as the addition amount of the non-compatible polymer increases, and therefore a reflectance is improved to contribute to improvement of brightness.<br>
In order to disperse the non-compatible polymer as a particle having a particle size of 0.2 to 5 jxm, it is effective to add a specific      '; gravity-decreasing material as a dispersion aid.    The specific gravity-decreasing material is a compound having an effect of decreasing a specific gravity and specific compounds have such an effect.   As the specific gravity-decreasing material, thermoplastic polyester elastomer is used. For example, representative examples thereof include polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, methoxy polyetlrylene glycol,<br>
 <br>
polytetramethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium alkylsulfonate, glyceryl monostearate, tetrabutylphosphonium, and p-aminobenzenesulfonate.    In the case of the film of the present invention, particularly, polyalkylene glycols, among them, polyethylene glycol is preferable.    Further, a copolymer of polybutylene terephthalate and polytetramethylene glycol is preferably used in order to improve the dispersibility of a non-compatible polymer.   An addition amount of the specific gravity-decreasing material is preferably 3% by weight or morQ and 40% by weight or less, taking an amount of the whole layer containing the non'compatible polymer as 100% by weight.    When the addition amount is less than 3% by weight, an effect of addition becomes low and the dispersibility of a polymer is deteriorated, and when the addition amount is more than 40% by weight, intrinsic characteristics of a base material of the film may be impaired.    Such the specific gravity-decreasing material can be controlled by being added to a film base material polymer in advance to prepare a master polymer (master chip).    With respect to a relationship between the specific gravity-decreasing material and optical properties, in a region from 3% by weight to 40% by weight, since a dispersion diameter becomes extremely small by adding a dispersion aid, number.iof void layers per the same, thickness increases and the reflectance is improved, and this<br>
contributes to increase in brightness of a screen.    In a region of more than<br>
'       I 40% by weight, even if the addition amount is increased, a dispersion<br>
|j<br>
diameter may not become small and may have no effect.	.<br>
As described above, when the white polyester film contains fine air<br>
 <br>
bubbles, thereby, the apparent specific gravity of the polyester!film becomes lower than that of a common polyester film.    If further adding the specific<br>
gravity-decreasing material, the specific gravity is further decreased.    That<br>
4	l|      '<br>
is, a white and light film can be obtained.    In order to reduce the weight of<br>
4	|     ■<br>
the white polyester film for a,liquid crystal display of the present invention while maintaining mechanical properties as a substrate for a liquid crystal display reflective plate, it is preferable that the apparent specific gravity be . 0.5 or more and 1.2 or less.    ' The apparent specific gravity is preferably 0.5 or more and 1.0 or less, and more preferably 0.55 or more andJ0.8 or less.<br>
In order to make the apparent specific gravity 0.5 or more and 1.2 or<br>
.'I	.        !   '<br>
less, in the case of using the specific gravity-decreasing material, for example polymethylpentene having a specific gravity of 0.83, as described above, the specific gravity-decreasing material is contained in an amount 5% by weight or more and 25% by weight or less with respect to the total weight of all layers and the film is stretched by 2.5 times to 4.5 times.<br>
■ ■:	I<br>
When the apparent specific gravity falls within the range of the present invention, it is possible to allow a large number of fine air bubbles to exist<br>
while maintaining film strength and a high reflectance can be attained. That is, when the white film of the present invention is used as a liquid<br>
crystal display reflective plate, it exhibits significantly excellent brightness<br>
in the brightness of a screen.;	'<br>
Further, the constitution of the white polyester film for a liquid<br>
I' .   ' crystal display reflective plate may be a two.-layer constitution of layer<br>
A/layer B, or may be a three-layer constitution of layer A/layer B/layer A,<br>
layer A/layer B/layer A' or layer A/layer B/layer C, or maybe a multi-layer<br>
 <br>
constitution of layer A/layer B/- -/layer B/layer A, for example, constitutions<br>
1	I!<br>
composed of at least 20 layers and at most 3000 layers.    It is preferable for<br>
achieving a high reflectance and a film forming property simultaneously<br>
I that the layer B become a layer containing the foregoing fine air bubbles<br>
In the case of forming layer A/layer B/layer A', the same material is used in<br>
the layer A and the layer A', but a thickness of the layer A' is made smaller<br>
than that of the layer A.    A preferable thickness of the layer A' is 0.1 to 3<br>
Hm, and more preferably 0.5 to 2 |im.    Further, it is preferable from the<br>
viewpoint of reducing light loss due to scattering and improving a mirror<br>
reflective property that the layer A (layer A') and/or the layer C<br>
corresponding to the surface of the film be layers formed by including<br>
inorganic particles and/or organic particles in polyester in an amount at<br>
least 0.01% by weight and at most 0.5% by weight, preferably,at most 0.1%<br>
by weight, more preferably at most 0.07% by weight with respect to the total<br>
weight of the layer A and/or the layer C (layers containing inorganic<br>
particles and/or organic particles ).    When the particles are added, as<br>
described above, a mirror reflective property is improved and therefore the<br>
gloss level can be increased to 110% or more.    However, when the addition<br>
amount of inorganic particles and/or organic particles is less than 0.01% by<br>
weight, since the surface becomes extremely smooth, the shdability of a flat<br>
surface is deteriorated and wind defects are apt to occur to decrease yield.<br>
The addition amount of inorganic particles and/or organic particles is<br>
preferably 0.01% by weight or more from the viewpoint of handling ability<br>
(prevention of surface flaws).<br>
Light diffuseness may be required depending on the form of other<br>
 <br>
members of a backlight in which the reflective film is used.    In this case, it<br>
ii i<br>
is also possible to bring the gloss level into 70% or less by including more<br>
particles in the layer A'.<br>
As inorganic particles and/or organic particles contained in a surface layer of the film, particles of a material selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate, silica, magnesium carbonate, zinc carbonate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, cerium oxide, magnesium oxide, barium sulfate, zinc sulfide, calcium phosphate, alumina, mica, titanated mica, talc, clay, kaolin, lithium fluoride and calcium fluoride can be used.    In the case of the present invention, silica is desirably used in order to maintain a high gloss of the surface.<br>
Herein, when a type of a backlight is a direct type, an addition amount of the particles is preferably ultimately 0% by weightj but since in this case slidability of the film is deteriorated and productivity is<br>
i!<br>
deteriorated, it is preferable to add a small amount of the particles.    The addition amount of the particles preferably falls within the region in consideration of an effect on an M value resulting from light scattering due to particle addition.<br>
Further, the reverse prism type has a structure in which the reflective plate 12 adheres tightly to the light guide plate 13 due to the constitution of this type in Fig. 1 and therefore there readily causes a problem that inorganic particles are exfoliated to damage the light guide plate. When the addition amount of the particles exceeds 0.5% by weight, the exfoliation of particles is apt to cause the flaws. The addition amount of the particles is preferably 0.5% by weight or less, and more preferably<br>
 <br>
0.1% by weight or Jess.<br>
In the edge hght type, if the planarity of the reflective film is too<br>
1 high, locations where the. film strongly adheres to the light guide plate are<br>
&gt;y, 'brightness And so, it is o the screen is<br>
generated  to  change   a  reflection  angle  there,   and  there<br>
i<br>
unevenness in a liquid crystal screen may be produced.<br>
commonly carried out that the adhesion of the reflective film<br>
decreased by giving a certain degree of surface roughness to the surface.    A<br>
number average particle size of the particles added for this purpose is<br>
preferably 3 um or more and 7 um or less, and more preferably 3 to 5 |xm.<br>
When the number average particle size on number is less than 3 urn, the<br>
roughness of the surface is lowered and adhesion between the film and the<br>
light guide plate may become high.    When the average particle size is more<br>
than 7 um, since the particle becomes coarse, it tends to exfoliate and this<br>
may damage the light guide plate.    On the other hand, in the direct type,<br>
since a cold cathode ray tube exists between the light guide plate and the<br>
reflective film, the light guide plate does not come into contact with the<br>
".!	I'<br>
reflective film and there is not a possibility of occurrence of flaws of the hght<br>
i<br>
guide plate and the screen non-uniformity due to adhesion.<br>
t The white polyester film of the present invention preferably has an<br>
■	I'<br>
applied layer containing spherical particles on at least one side of the white<br>
:i	.	1      '<br>
polyester film.    By containing the spherical particles, a projection shape is<br>
formed at the surface of the applied layer, and the light, which is reflected<br>
1	I      .<br>
off the white film surface and passes through the applied layer, is<br>
I' concentrated by a lens effectithrough the projection shape at the surface of<br>
.■	l|<br>
the applied layer and this contributes to improvement in the brightness in a<br>
 <br>
front direction of a backlight.<br>
A type of the spherical particle of the present invention is not particularly limited, and any of organic particles and inorganic particles can be employed.    As the organic spherical particles, acrylic resin particles, silicone resin particles, nylon resin particles, polystyrene resin particles, polyamide resin particles such as benzoguanamine, and urethane resin particles can be used.   As the inorganic spherical particles, silicon oxide, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, barium sulfide, magnesium silicate, and mixtures thereof can be used.    It is preferable to use the organic spherical particles from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the particles in a resin binder commonly used, ability to be applied and economy.   Among them, acrylic polymers, polystyrene polymers, and copolymers of acrylic-based vinyl monomer and styrenebasedivinyl monomer are preferable, and particularly, and copolymers of acrylic-based vinyl monomer and styrene-based vinyl monomer can be suitably used in the present invention because a refractive index can be changed by adjusting a copolymerization proportion of two kinds of vinyl monomers.<br>
When the applied layer is provided, it is preferable to adjust an absolute value (hereinafter, referred to as a refractive index differential) of a difference in refractive indexes between the spherical particle contained in the applied layer and the binder resin constituting the applied layer to 0.10<br>
or less.    As described above,'when the applied layer containsithe spherical<br>
I<br>
particles, the brightness in a front direction of a backlight is improved.<br>
However, if there is the refractive index differential between the spherical particle and the binder resin, light, which is diffused at the interface<br>
 <br>
between the spherical particle and the binder resin and reaches the surface of the applied layer, of the light, which is reflected off the white film surface and passes through the applied layer, is reduced.    That is; light loss due to<br>
internal diffusion is increased and the reflectance is reversely reduced.<br>
And so, since by adjusting the refractive index differential to 0.10 or less,<br>
1	-	■        I<br>
internally diffusing loss in the applied layer is reduced, light to reach the<br>
surface of the applied layer is relatively increased and the reflectance is<br>
improved.    When the refractive index differential is more than 0.10, even if<br>
the white reflective film of the present invention is incorporated into the<br>
backlight, an effect of improving the brightness may not be achieved.    The<br>
refractive index differential is preferably 0.08 or less, more preferably 0.05<br>
i t<br>
or less, and particularly preferably 0.01 or less.<br>
t<br>
The refractive index herein refers to a proportion in which the undulation (such as light) traveling in a straight line changes^an angle of a traveling direction at an interface between mediums, and it is a vacuum-based sub stance-specific value, that is, an absolute refractive index.<br>
Since the refractive index is an observed wavelength-specific value, the<br>
I refractive index differential is a difference between values measured at the<br>
same observed wavelength.    For example, a refractive index of polyGnethyl<br>
methacrylate), a typical acrylic resin, is 1.49 for light having a wavelength<br>
of 589.3 nm.	\   ■<br>
The refractive index differential referred to herein refers to an<br>
absolute value of a difference between a refractive index of the spherical<br>
particle and a refractive index of the binder resin, and even when the<br>
refractive index of the spherical particle is smaller than that of the binder<br>
1      .	H	!<br>
i<br>
 <br>
resin and the refractive index differential is a negative value, its absolute value, that is, a positive value is a refractive index differential.<br>
"The refractive index of the spherical particle", and "the refractive index of the binder" are determined as follows.<br>
(i) A binder resin is extracted from an applied layer by using an organic solvent and the organic solvent is distilled off, and then a refractive index of light is measured at 25°C at a wavelength of 589.3 nm with an ellipsometry method.    Values obtained by this measurement are taken as "a refractive index of a binder resin".<br>
(ii) The applied layer of a white reflective film is immersed in an organic solvent, and the applied layer is peeled off from the white film and then the applied layer is pressed against a slide glass and slid on the slide glass to exfoliate spherical particles from the applied layer.   A refractive index of the obtained spherical particle is determined according to a Becke's line detection method.    Specifically, the particle is put in a liquid organic compound, and the particle in the liquid organic compound is observed at. various liquid temperatures at which a refractive index of the^liquid is known and the refractive index of the liquid organic compound at the time when the outline of the particle cannot be recognized is taken as "a refractive index of a spherical particle".<br>
The volume average particle size is not particularly limited as long<br>
as the projection shape is formed at the surface of the applied! layer, but the<br>
volume average particle size is preferably 0.05 M-m or more, more preferably<br>
0.5 um or more, furthermore preferably 1 {im or more, and particularly<br>
ii<br>
preferably 3 u.m or more.    When the volume average particle isize is less<br>
 <br>
than 0.05 am, an effect of improving the brightness of a backlight may not be achieved.    Further, an upper limit of the volume average particle size is not particularly limited, but it is preferably 100 ^m or less since the ability to be applied may be poor if it exceeds 100 [xm.<br>
In the spherical particles, a coefficient of variation CV of the volume<br>
average particle size is preferably 30% or less.    The coefficient of variation<br>
CV herein refers to a value obtained by dividing a standard deviation of the<br>
volume average particle size by the volume average particle size.    This<br>
coefficient of variation CV is measured by a method described in Example<br>
described later.    The coefficient of variation CV is more preferably 20% or<br>
less, particularly preferably 15% or less, and the most preferably 10% or<br>
less.    When the coefficient of variation CV is more than 30%, since the<br>
uniformity of the particles is poor, the diffuseness of light is intensified and<br>
an effect of improving the brightness of a backlight may become low.    The<br>
CV value can be reduced by classifying the particles and removing the<br>
particles having an uneven particle size.	j<br>
The spherical particle is preferably nonporous from the viewpoint of<br>
I. improvement in reflectance arid light resistance.    If the spherical particle is<br>
porous, an area of refractive interface between the binder resin and the<br>
spherical particle increases, and therefore light loss due to internal diffusion<br>
is increased and the reflectance is apt to decrease.    Further, when a light<br>
resistant resin is used as a binder resin of the applied layer, if the spherical<br>
particle is porous, the binder resin is penetrated into pores.  . [Therefore,<br>
even if the binder resin is added in the same amount as that of the binder<br>
j<br>
resin in a case where nonporous spherical particles are used,la thickness of<br>
1 =<br>
 <br>
he applied layer becomes relatively small and the light resistance may be leteriorated.<br>
The content of the spherical particles in the applied layer is not<br>
i<br>
larticularly limited as long as the reflectance is improved, but1 the content of he spherical particle is preferably 3% by weight or more with Irespect to the vhole applied layer, though it cannot be uniquely limited because it depends<br>
il<br>
&gt;n the types of the particle and the dispersibility of the particle in a coating jolution.    The content is more preferably 5% by weight or more, urthermore preferably 10% by weight or more, and particularly preferably<br>
L5% by weight or more.    When the content is less than 3% byfweight, an<br>
I iffect of improving the brightness of a backlight may not be achieved.<br>
i<br>
further, an upper limit of the content is not particularly limited, but the content is preferably 30% by weight or less since the ability to be applied nay be poor if it exceeds 30% by weight.<br>
When the applied layer is provided, since the spherical particle leeds to be dispersed in a solvent during an applying step, the spherical Jarticle requires solvent resistance and therefore the spherical particles preferably have a crosslinking structure.    When the spherical particles do lot have a crosslinking structure, the spherical particles are eluted during ;he applying step and there may be cases where the applied layer in which particle shapes and particle sizes are maintained cannot be provided.<br>
In order to form the crosslinking structure, it is preferable to form :he crosslinking structure by use of vinyl compounds having a plurality of functional groups in a molecule, and it is particularly preferable to use polyfunctional acrylic compounds such as difunctional acrylic.compounds,<br>
 <br>
trifunctional acrylic compounds, and at least tetrafunctional acrylic compounds as vinyl compounds having a plurality of functional groups in a molecule<br>
As the spherical particle, "TECHPOLYMER" (manufactured by SEKISUI PLASTICS Co., Ltd.) can be used.    When a coefficient of variation<br>
:i ■I<br>
is 30% or less, S series in the "TECHPOLYMER" products are; preferable, and when a coefficient of variation is 15% or less, spherical particles made of a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate such as SSX series products can be most suitably used.<br>
In the spherical particles, it is preferable that an ultraviolet<br>
ij<br>
absorber and/or a light stabilizer be added and that in producing these resins, the resin be chemically combined with an ultraviolet absorber and/or a light stabilizer, having a reactive double bond, by copolymerization.    It is preferable to fix the ultraviolet absorber and/or the light stabilizer by chemically combining like the latter in that bleed out from the spherical particle is less.<br>
The ultraviolet absorber and the light stabilizer contained in the spherical particle are broadly divided into inorganic agents and organic agents.<br>
As inorganic-based ultraviolet absorbers, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, cerium oxide and the like are commonly known, and among them, zinc oxide is the most preferable in point of economy, an ultraviolet absorbing property and photocatalyst activity.<br>
Examples of organic-based ultraviolet absorbers may include benzotriazole-based, benzophenone-based, oxalic anilide-based,<br>
 <br>
cyanoacrylate'based and triazine-based ultraviolet absorbers.    Since these ultraviolet absorbers just absorb ultraviolet rays and cannot capture organic radicals produced by ultraviolet irradiation, this radical may cause chain reaction degradation of a white film to become a substrate.    It is preferable to use the ultraviolet absorber in combination with the light stabilizer in order to capture these radicals and particularly a light stabilizer of a hindered amine'based compound is suitably used.<br>
As copolymerization monomers to fix the organic-based ultraviolet absorbers and/or the light stabilizers, acrylic-based or styrene'based vinyl monomers are preferable because of high general versatility and economy. Since styrene-based vinyl monomers have aromatic rings and are susceptible to yellowing, they are the most preferably copolymerized with the acrylicbased vinyl monomer from the viewpoint of light resistance.<br>
As a reactive vinyl monomer-substituted benzotriazole, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methacryloxyethylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole (trade name:<br>
RUVA-93, manufactured by Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd.) can be used.<br>
i Further, as a reactive vinyl monomer-substituted hindered amine<br>
compound, 4-methacryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyne ("ADK STAB<br>
LA'82" manufactured by Adeka Argus Industry Co., Ltd.) can'be used.<br>
Since if a difference in refractive indexes between the binder resin<br>
and the spherical particle in the applied layer is reduced as far as possible,<br>
the reflectance is improved, it is preferable that copolymer components and<br>
monomer composition of the binder resin be identical to those of the<br>
I!<br>
:i<br>
spherical particle.    Furthermore, when both of the binder resin and the spherical particle are composed of resins to which an ultraviolet absorber<br>
 <br>
and/or a light stabilizer is added, the light resistance of the applied layer can also be improved.       '.    -In the white reflective film of the present invention, the white film of<br>
a substrate may be deteriorated (e.g., photodeterioration such as yellowing,<br>
.1	I      ■<br>
or degradation in which a molecular weight is decreased) during being used<br>
'	-	I<br>
as a backlight by light, particularly ultraviolet rays, emitted from a lamp of<br>
i	J   ■<br>
a cold cathode ray tube or the like, and therefore it is preferable that the<br>
ultraviolet absorber and/or the light stabilizer be contained in a layer of the<br>
white film of a substrate and/or in the binder resin layer provided on one<br>
side.	Materials of the binder resin layer is not particularly limited, but<br>
i	\ ■<br>
resins principally containing organic components are preferable and<br>
examples of the resins include polyester resin, polyurethane resin, acrylic<br>
'    !	Il<br>
resin, methacrylic resin, polyamide resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene   ,<br>
I resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, polyvinylidene chloride resin, polystyrene<br>
'	1      ■<br>
resin, polyvinyl acetate resin, and fluorine-based resins.    These resins may<br>
be used alone or as a copolymer or a mixture of two or more kinds of them.<br>
Among them, the polyester resin, the polyurethane resin, and acrylic or<br>
dispersibility of particles, an ability to be applied and a gloss level.    From<br>
the viewpoint of the light resistance of the applied layer, it is more<br>
preferable that the binder resin layer also contain an ultraviolet absorber<br>
and a light stabilizer.	]<br>
A resin constituting a resin layer containing an ultraviolet absorber is not particularly limited, and resins containing an inorganic ultraviolet<br>
methacrylic resin are preferably used from the viewpoint of heat resistance,<br>
 <br>
absorber, resins containing an organic ultraviolet absorber, and resins<br>
 <br>
stabilizer, by<br>
formed by copolymerizing a benzotriazole-based or a benzophenone-based reactive monomer can be used.<br>
As a resin constituting a resin layer containing a light i organic ultraviolet absorbing resins containing a resin formed' copolymerizing a hindered amine (HALS)-based reactive monomer and the like are preferably used.        .<br>
As the inorganic-based ultraviolet absorber, zinc oxide[ titanium<br>
f     ' oxide, cerium oxide and zirconium oxide are common.    Among these<br>
II absorbers, at least one selected from the group consisting of zinc oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and cerium oxide is preferably used because it does not cause<br>
bleed out and has an excellent light resistance.    Such ultraviolet absorber<br>
'	.	I<br>
may be used in combination of several kinds as required.    Among them,<br>
zinc oxide is the most preferable in point of economy, an ultraviolet<br>
■!<br>
absorbing property and photocatalyst activity.   As the zinc oxide, FINEX-25<br>
f LP, FINEX-50 LP (manufactured by Sakai Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd.) and<br>
the like can be used.<br>
As the organic-based'ultraviolet absorbers, resins containing an<br>
organic ultraviolet absorber such as benzotriazole and benzophenone, resins<br>
formed by copolymerizing a benzotriazole-based or a benzophenone-based<br>
reactive monomer, or resins formed by copolymerizing these resins with a<br>
light stabilizer such as a hindered amine (HALS)-based reactive monomer can be used.    Particularly, resins formed by copolymerizing a benzotriazole-based or a benzophenone-based reactive monomer, and<br>
organic ultraviolet absorbing resins containing a resin formed by<br>
 <br>
copolymerizing a hindered amine (HALS)-based reactive monomer with the<br>
« resins are more preferable because of a large effect of absorbing ultraviolet<br>
light in a thin layer.<br>
Methods for manufacturing these resins are disclosed in detail in paragraphs [0019] to [0039] of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.2002-90515.    Particularly, HALSHYBRID (registered trademark) (manufactured by NIPPON SHOKUBAI CO., LTD.) containing a copolymer of an acrylic monomer and an ultraviolet absorber as an active component, and the like can be used.<br>
As described previously, if a difference in refractive indexes between the resin binder and the spherical particle is reduced as far as possible, since the reflectance is improved and further the light resistance of the applied layer is also improved, it is preferable that copolymer components, monomer composition, ultraviolet absorbers and light stabilizers of the resin binder be identical to those of the spherical particle.<br>
Next, a method for manufacturing a white polyester film for a light<br>
I reflective plate of the present invention will be described, but the present<br>
invention is not limited to this example.<br>
First, purity of terephthalic acid being a base of polyethylene<br>
terephthalate is increased to reduce a total amount of metal catalyst<br>
compounds such as compounds using an element group of Sb, K, P, Mg, Li,<br>
Ca, Ge and Ti at the time of forming polyester being a base by<br>
polymerization, and by controlling reaction time and reaction temperature,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, which has less catalyst residue and has a high L<br>
value and a low b value, is obtained.<br>
 <br>
Next, polymethylpentene as a non-compatible polymer, and<br>
polyethylene glycol and a copolymer of polybutylene terephthalate and<br>
1-      ■ polytetramethylene glycol as, a specific gravity-de creasing material are<br>
I mixed in the polyethylene terephthalate formed by polymerization by the<br>
above method, and the resulting mixture is adequately mixed and dried, and<br>
then supplied to an extruder A heated to a temperature of 270 to 300°C     If<br>
required, polyethylene terephthalate including inorganic additives such as<br>
Si02 may be supplied to an extruder B by a common method, and a layer of<br>
the extruder A and a layer of the extruder B may be laminated in a<br>
three-layer constitution of layer A/layer B/layer A in a TMie three-layer<br>
'!<br>
nozzle so that a polymer of the layer of the extruder B becomes both surface<br>
i<br>
layers.	■'
a drum, a<br>
This melted sheet was brought into close contact with<br>
surface temperature of which is cooled to 10 to 60°CJ by an electrostatic<br>
I force, cooled, and solidified to obtain a non-stretched film, and the<br>
■    '	||<br>
non-stretched film is guided to a series of rolls heated to a temperature of 80<br>
to 120°C, stretched by 2.0 to 5.0 times in a longitudinal direction, and cooled<br>
with a series of rolls of 20 to '50°C.    Subsequently, the film stretched in a<br>
longitudinal direction was led to a tenter while grasping both/ends of the<br>
film with clips, and was transversely stretched in a direction perpendicular<br>
to a longitudinal direction in an atmosphere heated to a temperature of 90<br>
!	i|<br>
to 140°C.    The film is stretched by 2.5 to 4.5 times in a longitudinal or transverse direction, but a ratio of area of the stretched film to original area<br>
(longitudinal draw ratio x transverse draw ratio) is preferably 9 to 16.<br>
1	.1<br>
When the ratio of area is less than 9, whiteness of the resulting film<br>
 <br>
becomes poor, and when the ratio is more than 16, the film is apt to break in stretching and a film forming property tends to become poor.    In order to impart planarity and dimensional stability to the film thus biaxially stretched, the film is subjected to heat setting at a temperature of 150 to 230°C in the tenter and is slowly cooled uniformly to room temperature and wound to obtain a film of the present invention.<br>
Various additives may be added to the white film and/or the applied layer of the present invention within the range of not impairing the effects of the present invention.    As the additives, for example, organic andVor inorganic fine particles, fluorescent brighteners, crosslinking agents, heat stabilizers, antioxidants, organic lubricants, antistatic agents, nucleating agents, dyes, fillers, dispersants, coupling agents and the like can be used.<br>
In the white reflective plate of the present invention, an average<br>
reflectance at a wavelength of 400 to 700 nm measured from a plane in<br>
which the applied layer is provided is preferably 85% or morej more<br>
preferably 87% or more, and1 particularly preferably 90% or more.    When<br>
the average reflectance is less than 85%, some liquid crystal displays to<br>
which the white film of the present invention is applied may be low in<br>
brightness.    When the applied layer is provided on both sides of the white<br>
film, the average reflectance measured from any one of applied layers on<br>
both sides may be 85% or more.	'     "<br>
When the applied layer of the present invention is applied to a white film being a substrate, a coating solution may be applied by any method. The methods such as gravure coating, roller coating, spin coating, reverse coating, bar coating, screen coating, blade coating, air knife coating, and<br>
 <br>
dipping may be employed.    Further, the coating solution for forming the applied layer may be applied (in line coating) concurrently with the<br>
i<br>
production of the white film of a substrate may be used, or may be applied (offline coating) onto a white film in which the crystalline orientation has been completed.<br>
The white reflective film of the present invention thus.obtained can realize an improvement in the brightness of the liquid crystal backlight, and in accordance with the further preferred aspect, the white reflective film can be favorably used as reflective plates for area light sources of edge-light and<br>
direct type for a liquid crystal screen and as reflectors since the reduction in<br>
I reflectance is low even long-term use.    When the white reflective film of the<br>
I<br>
present invention is used in these area light sources, it is installed with its<br>
applied layer directed to the light sources.<br>
The white polyester film for a liquid crystal display reflective plate of the present invention thus obtained has fine air bubbles formed within the film to achieve a high reflectance and can attain high brightness when it is used as a reflective plate of side light type liquid crystal displays and direct type    liquid crystal displays. [Measurement of Properties and Method of Evaluation of Effect]<br>
Methods of evaluation of properties and methods of evaluation of<br>
effects of the present invention are as follows.	j<br>
(l) Spectral Reflectance        ■?<br>
n<br>
A reflectance in a case where an integrating sphere was attached to a spectrophotometer (U-3310) manufactured by Hitachi High-Technologies Corp. and a standard white plate (aluminum oxide) is taken as 100% is<br>
 <br>
measured over a wavelength of 450 to 600 nm.    The reflectance is read from the resulting chart at 5 nm intervals and this reflectance is taken as a spectral reflectance.<br>

In the method, in at least one side (side A) of the film, the spectral<br>
reflectance at a wavelength range of 450 to 600 nm is measured.    The<br>
wavelength dependency of spectral reflectance is approximated according to<br>
the following approximation formula R:<br>
by a least square method, based on spectral reflectance measured at 5 nm<br>
intervals to determine M (%/nm) and R560.	jj<br>
In the formula, R represents a light reflectance (%), "k represents a<br>
i-wavelength of light (nm), M represents a wavelength coefficient (%/nm), B<br>
represents a constant (%), and R560 represents an estimated reflectance<br>
obtained by introducing X = 560 nm into the approximation formula R (%).<br>

<br>
of water were added.    This mixture was stirred at a rotating speed of 9000<br>
rpm. for 3 minutes with a homogenizer to disperse the polymerizable<br>
<br>
compound in water.    Next, this dispersion was heated to 75°C and<br>
maintained at this temperature for 2 hours to be reacted, and|the dispersion<br>
was further heated to 90°C to be reacted for 3 hours.<br>
<br>
After performing the reaction described above, the dispersion was<br>
cooled to room temperature and filtrated with a mesh filter having an<br>
opening of 40 ^im to eliminate flocculated substances.    There was no<br>
flocculated substance in the resulting dispersion and the filtration of the<br>
dispersion was very excellent.<br>
The resin particles dispersed in the dispersion thus filtrated have a<br>
volume average particle size of 6.4 |im and this resin particle was<br>
completely spherical.	<br>
Thus, the dispersion of the resin particles was washed according to a<br>
normal method and then filtrated to separate the resin particles from a<br>
<br>
dispersion medium, and separated resin particles were dried and classified<br>
to obtain spherical particles'A (coefficient of variation CV 15%).<br>

 <br>
There were effects of improving the brightness (that is, effects of improving the reflectance of a white reflective film itself) in all of Examples 10 to 21.<br>
When comparing properties among Examples 18 to 21, it is found that if the difference in refractive indexes between the binder .resin and the spherical particle is reduced, the brightness is improved.<br>
When comparing properties among Examples 11, 15, 16, and Comparative Example 11, it is found that if the coefficient of variation of the<br>
 <br>
spherical particle is reduced, the brightness is improved (comparison between Examples 11, 15, 16).<br>
When comparing properties among Examples 10, 11, 13, it is found<br>
that even if the differences in refractive indexes and the coefficients of<br>
variation are the same, the brightness varies depending on the content of<br>
the spherical particle in the applied layer.    When comparing properties<br>
between Examples 14 and 15, it is found that even if the differences in<br>
refractive indexes and the coefficients of variation are the same, the<br>
brightness varies depending on the a volume average particle size of the<br>
spherical particles.	<br>
Further, when a similar applied layer was provided on a white film, in which an addition amount of the particles in a surface layer was adjusted within a certain range, the brightness was further improved (Example 12).<br>
When the coefficient of variation exceeded 30, improvement in the<br>
<br>
brightness was small even though the difference  in refractive indexes between the resin binder and the spherical particle was 0.10 or less (Examples 16, 17).<br>
When the porous particles were used, or silicone or polystyrene susceptible to yellowing was used, there was an improvement in the brightness, but the light resistance was slightly low (Examples 17, 20, 2l).<br>
When the applied layer was not provided, the light resistance was rejected (Comparative Examples 7, 8).      When the spherical particles were not added   or when the difference in refractive indexes between the resin binder and the spherical particle was more than 0.10, improvement in the brightness was not observed even though the applied layer was provided<br>
