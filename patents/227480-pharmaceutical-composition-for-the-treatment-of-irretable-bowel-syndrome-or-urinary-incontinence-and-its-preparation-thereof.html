				<td>This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or urinary incontinence.<br>
Danfenacin   is   (S)-2-{1 -[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-3-pyrrolidinyI}-2,2-diphenyl-acetafnide and is disclosed in European Patent N° 0388054, Examples 1B and 8, and is referred   to   therein    as   3-(S)-(-)-(1-carbamoyl-1,1-diphenylmethyl)-1-[2-(2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]pyrrolidine.   It is indicated in the treatment of urinary incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome and has the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Clinical investigations have shown a major metabolite of darifenacin to be the following 3'-hydroxy derivative:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It appears that the metabolite is 6-fold less selective for muscarinic M3 receptors over M1 receptors in comparison with darifenacin, and so the metabolite is more likely than darifenacin to produce unwanted side-effects such as dry mouth, confusion and blurred vision.<br>
It has now been found that delivering darifenacin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts to the lower gastrointestinal tract (e.g. in a sustained release formulation) gives rise to a greater ratio of darifenacin to metabolite-in the systemic circulation. This increases the bioavailability of darifenacin, which is likely to minimize any unwanted side-effects. This is surprising because a slower release rate normally leads to a slower delivery to liver enzymes and a greater degree of metabolism of an administered drug.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical dosage form adapted for administration to the gastrointestinal tract of a patient, comprising darifenacin,<br>
 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier; characterized in that the dosage form is adapted to deliver at least 10% by weight of the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the lower gastrointestinal tract of the patient.<br>
The dosage forms of the invention may be of the sustained or delayed release type, and so release the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the gastrointestinal tract of the patient over or after a sustained period of time following administration of the dosage form to the patient. However, when the dosage forms are administered rectally, conventional rectal formulations may be used.<br>
By "lower gastrointestinal tract" is meant the portion of the gastrointestinal tract between the region of the ileo-caecal junction and the rectum inclusive.<br>
"Patient" means primarily a human patient, although the formulations of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of non-human animals.<br>
 Preferably, the dosage forms of the invention are adapted to deliver at least 25%, and more preferably 50% by weight of the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the lower gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Preferably, no more than 90% by weight of the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is released 4 hours after dosing; more preferably no more than 90% by weight of the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is released 8 hours after dosing; and most preferably, no more than 90% by weight of the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is released 16 hours after dosing.<br>
The conditions in the gastrointestinal tract are thought to be reproduced in vitro using Apparatus 1 described in USP XXII at. page 1578, having baskets of 40 mesh (381 µm apertures), a rotation speed of 100 rpm and a dissolution medium of water at 37°C. Therefore, the sustained release formulations of the invention may be defined alternatively as a pharmaceutical dosage form adapted for administration to the gastrointestinal tract of a patient, comprising darifenacin, or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier; characterized in that the<br>
dosage form is adapted to release the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in Apparatus 1 described in USP XXII at page 1578, having baskets of 40 mesh (381 µm apertures), a rotation speed of 100 rpm and a dissolution medium of water at 37°C, over a sustained period of time.<br>
Particular oral dosage forms include:<br>
(a)	those in which the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is<br>
embedded in a matrix from which it is released by diffusion or erosion;<br>
(b)	those in which the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is<br>
present in a multiparticulate core;<br>
(c)	those in which there is. an impermeable coating provided with an aperture through<br>
which the darifenacin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is released;<br>
(d)	those in which there is a coating of low aqueous solubility;<br>
(e)	those in which there is a semipermeable coating;<br>
(f)	those in which the darifenacin is present as an ion exchange resin complex; and<br>
(g)	pulsatile devices from which the darifenacin is released at specific points in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the above means of achieving sustained release may be combined: for example a matrix containing the active compound may be formed into a multiparticulate and/or coated with an impermeable coating provided with an aperture.<br>
Dealing with each category in turn:<br>
(a)	In matrix systems, which are preferred, the active compound is embedded or<br>
dispersed in a matrix of another material which serves to retard the release of the active<br>
compound into an aqueous environment. Suitable matrix materials include hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose. Matrix formulations according to the present<br>
invention preferably comprise high molecular weight (i.e. 85,000-95,000 mass units)<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.<br>
(b)	In multiparticulate cores, the active compound is present in a number of particles<br>
which also contain adjuvants, diluents or carriers.    Suitable adjuvants, diluents and<br>
carriers include microcrystaliine cellulose (preferably having a particle size of 50jam) and<br>
lactose (preferably having a particle size equivalent to 110 mesh (137.5jim apertures)).<br>
Typically, the blended ingredients are formed into a wet mass which is extruded and spheronized to form beads which are then dried.<br>
(c)	Impermeabie coatings are applied to tablets containing the active compound.<br>
"Impermeable" means that no significant transport of the active compound can take place<br>
across the coating during the intended release period of the formulation.    Suitable<br>
materials include film-forming polymers and waxes [e.g. thermoplastic polymers such as<br>
poly(ethylene-covinyl acetate), poly(vinyl chloride), ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate]<br>
and the coating thickness is preferably greater than 100µm. The aperture may be formed<br>
by drilling, or if the coated formulation is conical, by cutting off the tip.<br>
(d)	Coatings of low aqueous solubility include polymers.    The solubility of such<br>
polymers may be pH-dependent, for example substantially insoluble at pH
dissolution does not take part in the stomach) and water soluble at pH&gt;5.  Preferred pH-<br>
sensitive polymers include shellac, phthalate derivatives (including cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate), polyacrytic acid derivatives, and vinyl acetate and<br>
crotonic acid copolymers.<br>
(e)	Semipermeable membrane coatings allow the active compound to diffuse across<br>
the membrane or through liquid filled pores within the membrane.    Suitable coating<br>
materials include polymers such as cellulose ester or ether, and acrylic polymers.<br>
Preferred materials include ethyl cellulose,  cellulose acetate and  cellulose acetate<br>
butyrate.<br>
(f)	Darifenacin resinates may be prepared by treating anionic ion exchange resin<br>
beads (for example sodium  polystyrene sulphonate) with  an acid  addition salt of<br>
darifenacin.<br>
(g)	Pulsatile devices have the capacity to release drug at various points of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract.  They may depend on osmotic potential to trigger release (see US<br>
Patent N° 3,952,741) or erosion of polymeric material due to changes in pH or microbial<br>
degradation.   Suitable polymeric materials include pectin [Rubinstein et al, 1991, Pectic<br>
salt as a colonic delivery system, Proceed. Intern. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater.],<br>
methacrylate-galactomannan [Lehman et al,-1991, Methacrylate-galactomannan coating<br>
for colonic specific drug delivery, ibid] matter containing azobonds [Kopeckova et al,<br>
1991, Bioadhesive polymers for colon specific drug delivery, ibid], chondroitin [Sintov et<br>
al, 1991, Colonic administration of indomethacin using modified chondroitin in a cannu-<br>
lated dog model, iibid], dextran hydrogels [Bronsted et al, 1993, A novel hydrogel system<br>
designed for controlled drug delivery to the colon, ibid], methacryiic acid copolymers<br>
[Siefke et al, 1993, ß-CycIodextrin matrix films for colon specific drug delivery, ibid], and<br>
amyiose [Milojevfk et al, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of amylose coated pellets for colon specific drug delivery, ibid]. Delivery to specific points of the gastrointestinal tract may also be achieved using multilayered tablets [Gazzaniga et al, 1993, Time dependent oral delivery system for co!on specific release, ibid], or hydrogel plugs in a capsule [Binhs et al, Application of-a-pH-independent PEG-based-hydrogel-to afford pulsatile drug delivery).<br>
Preferably, in the dosage forms of the present Invention, the darifenacin is in the form of its hydrobromide salt (except when the darifenacin is present as an ion exchange resin complex).<br>
A preferred oral formulation is a tablet consisting essentially of darifenacin hydrobromide in a high molecular weight hydroxypropyf methylcellulose matrix together with anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate and magnesium stearate. The tablet may be colour coated by conventional methods. Preferably, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose makes up 56-58% w/w of the tablet, magnesium stearate makes up approximately 1% of the tablet, and darifenacin hydrobromide and anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate make up the balance. The darifenacin hydrobromide content may range from 4mg-54mg per tablet, depending on the dose to be delivered. Such tablets would be suitable for administration once daily.<br>
Preferably, the dosage forms of the present invention are adapted for oral administration, but they may also be adpated for rectal administration. Rectal suppository formulations may be prepared by dispersing the active ingredient in hardened oils or waxes using conventional methods.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treatment of "irritable bowel syndrome or urinary incontinence, which comprises delivering darifenacin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the lower gastrointestinal tract of a patient in need of such treatment. The method may be performed by administering a dosage form of the invention to the gastrointestinal tract of a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or urinary incontinence comprising darifenacin, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and 50-55% of a high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose matrix, 1% magnesium stearate, wherein said darifenacin and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate make up the balance, characterized in that said composition is effective when darifenacin and the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is at least 10% by weight.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also relates to a process for the production of a composition as claimed in claim 1, which comprises mixing in a manner such as herein described, wherein 50 to 55% of high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is mixed with 1% magnesium stearate and darifenacin and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate make up the balance.<br>

Measurement of in vitro release rates<br>
Dissolution methods<br>
Dissolution of the formulations of Examples 1-4 was performed using a rotating basket apparatus (Apparatus 1, USPXXII, p. 1578). The formulations were placed in baskets (40 mesh, 381 µm apertures) using a rotation speed of 100rpm in 900ml water at 37°C +/-0.5°C. At specified time intervals, 10ml aliquots were removed from the dissolution vessel from a zone midway between the surface of the dissolution medium and the top of the basket not less than 1cm from the vessel wall. The first 7ml is discarded and the remaining solution transferred to an HPLC vial for subsequent analysis.<br>
The release of darifenacin from the formulation of Example 5 was determined according to USP XXIII Apparatus 4 (page 1794). Using a flow rate of 250ml/hour solutions at 37°C of the following pH were used to assess release: 0-1hrpH 1.5; 1-2hrpH2.5; 2-3.5hr pH4.5; 3.5-5hrpH 6.9; 5-24hrpH 7.2.<br>
Dissolution of the formulation of Example 6 was performed using a rotating basket apparatus (Apparatus 1, USPXXII, p 1578). The formulations were placed in baskets (40mesh, 381 µm apertures) using a-rotation speed of 100rpm in 900ml water at 37°C +/-0.5°C. At specified time intervals a 20ml aliquot of dissolution media was removed from a zone midway between the surface of the dissolution media and the top of the basket not less than 1cm from the vessel wall. The aliquots were filtered (0.45µm, Acrodisc) and the<br>
first 5ml of filtrate discarded. 5m! of the remaining filtrate was then diluted to 25ml using a 1:1 (v/v) solution of water/methanol prior to analysis by HPLC.<br>
Analysis<br>
For the formulations of Examples 1-5, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a BDS Hypersil" C18 column. The mobile phase used was an aqueous 0.03M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate at pH 3.5/methanol, (1000:800 v/v) using a flow rate of 1.5ml/min at 37°C and a sample size of 20µL Detection was by fluorescence operating at an excitation wavelength of 288nm (slit width 18nm) and an emission wavelength of 320nm (slit width 18nm).<br>
For the formulation of Example 6, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Novapack C18 column. The mobile phase was aqueous 0,01 M sodium acetate containing 0.2%v/v triethylamine at pH 6.0/methanoI/acetonitrile (45:54:1,v/v/v) using a flow rate of 1.0ml/min and a sample size of. 50µl. Detection was by<br>

Clinical Pharmacokinetics Study<br>
A four way, multiple dose crossover study to investigate the bioavailability of darifenacin and its 3'-hydroxy metabolite when given as a sustained release formulation compared with an immediate release formulation was carried out. Thirteen normal males received the formulations of Examples 1-3 of each for 6 days as well as the formulation of Example 6 three times a day. Plasma samples for drug and metabolite assay were taken over 24 hours on the last day of dosing for each period of the study. The pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours, AUC, maximum concentration and concentration at 24 hours post dose) were obtained for both drug and metabolite. The table below shows the ratio of AUC values for darifenacin and metabolite (AUCdanfenaciniAUCrnetaboiite) and the relative bioavailability of darifenacin (Fre daroferoacoin) and metabolite (Frel metabolite) for the formulations versus an immediate release capsule.<br>
