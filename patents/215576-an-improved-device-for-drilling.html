				<td>This invention relates to an improved device for drilling, The device of the present invention particularly useful for drilling holes in underground mine roofs and sides at any angle and easily portable from one place to another.<br>
The underground coal mines in India are generally run by producing coal from coal seams by blasting the solid coal and t ranspo r t i ng t he same, The cross tunnels of and pi11 a r s are generally formed and then pillars are taken out. The roof of tunnels are to be well supported as workers are exposed to this area of working. The roofs of mines/tunnels are supported by many means. Now a days, roof bolts are being used widely as an alter¬native to direct supporting. This roof bolts are inserted within drilled holes filled with cement grout, to enhance the binding strength of the composite rocks. This process needs drilling holes regularly in the roof. Also, as the process for general production, they need drilling holes at the working face of an advancing tunnel. Therefore, it is a normal demand that coal mines necessitate drilling in rocks and coals regularly.<br>
The holes drilled either for supporting the roof or for production purpose, are made by manual Labourers in almost all the mines. This manual method of drilling is very cumbersome and always difficult job for the? workers alongwith a certain amount o f r i s k a1toge t he r.<br>
The workers generally drill the holes by available hand-held drill.. Fig, 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification<br><br>
shows the schematic diagram of a hand-held electric drill ma¬chine. Two to three persons hold the machine by handles and then drill holes by forcibly pushing the machine which is having an external electric connection through cable.<br>
In case of drilling holes in the working face in a mine It is difficult .and hazardous and is more so at the time of drilling<br>
the roof using hand	held drill machine. Workers are to stand on a<br>
raised platform/table and drill upward holes in the roof when there Is every chance of debris falling over their eyes and faces. There Is also risk of roof fall at the time of drilling as they are supposed to stand below the unsupported roof for all the time during operations. Again, for drilling holes in hard rocks<br>
*<br>
it. becomes very difficult by this manually held machine which cannot provide sufficient pushing force. Also, It is not possible to drill holes in the roof of mines at a considerable height.<br>
There is a great demand for a drilling machine	which would<br>
be suitable for drilling hard and soft roof rocks,	can provide<br>
pushing force and sufficient torque and at the same	time highly<br>
portable In underground workings.<br>
The operation of the machine should be simple and mainte¬nance should be easier. It should preferably operated from a distance such that human being has not to go directly under the roof at the drilling position.<br><br>
Above all, It should be economically viable for wide use by common mines . It should also be able to drill holes at any angle to the rock exposure in tunnels.<br>
The main object of the present invention Is to provide an Improved device for drilling particularly useful for underground mines/tunnels,<br>
Another object Is to provide a roof drilling device which Is compact, easily transportable, robust adjustable to different height and angle, simple in operation and maintenance as well as e c o n o m I c a 11 y v I a b 1 e .<br>
Figure 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification shows the schematic diagram of the device of the present inven¬tion. The various components are a drilling unit, a power pack unit, a telescopic jack unit, a motor and a mobile transporting unit for the drill unit.<br>
Accordingly, the present Invention provides an improved device for drilling, which comprises a telescopic, double acting hydraulic ram (14), capable of providing bidirectional movement, the ram being connected to a hydraulic power pack capable of providing bidirectional hydraulic pressure to the said ram, the said power pack being connected to a prime mover (4) with remote control (12), the said ram and power pack being enclosed in a casing (6) having removably fixed means (5) at the sides of the casing for holding and means (l) at its bottom capable of absorb-<br><br>
ing thrust/shock, the said prime mover being fixed on to the outer surface of the said casing (6), the top end of the said ram being connected to known chuck (10), the said chuck having a removably fixed drill rod (11) with drill bit (16) at its top end, the chuck being provided with means(8,9) capable of provid¬ing rotation to the said chuck at variable speeds.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the prime mover (4) used may be such as a flame proof electric motor.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the means used for rotation of the chuck, at variable speeds may be such as an electric motor connected to the said chuck through a gear-trai n.<br>
The present invention incorporates improvement in drilling process in underground mines/tunnels, which would significantly free the system from normal components, thereby increasing its efficiency, effectiveness and will be much safer working at the same time. The present invention is an equipment easily trans¬portable by manual labour in underground mines as a single unit on a light structure of multi wheels.<br>
The drilling unit can be brought to the site where holes are to be drilled by the help of means such as a multi wheeled structure. A drill rod (11) is attached with the chuck (10) for drilling purpose. Then the motor and pump can be run to lift the double telescopic jack (7).<br><br>
Then the pushing ram (7) Is operated by the electrical cable control unit (12) and also the motor of drill unit is operated by the control unit (13) to run the drill rod at required rotation through the reduction gear unit (9),. While in drilling operation the extension piece (1) can be extended up to the ground by mechanically or by hydraullcally. Then, the back force involved due to drilling on the pressure ram would be transferred through the extension piece (1) to the ground. The operator may be at a distance of 5m so while conducting the. drilling operation.<br>
The main advantages of the equipment of the present invention;<br>
1.	It, can be easily transported in underground tunnels/mines,<br>
2..	It. can drill holes in hard rocks without manual hardship<br>
3,	It. is safer to drill the holes In the roofs of tunnels,.<br>
•4 -	1t enhance,s the speed of clri111ng ho1es in the rock mass .<br>
5.	It is easy to operate and repair.<br>
6.	Running cost is least .arid maintenance cost is minimum.<br>
7.	The price of the  equipment is very cost effective.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1,	An Improved device for drilling, which comprises a tele¬<br>
scopic, double acting hydraulic ram (14), capable of providing<br>
bidirectional movement, the ram being connected to a hydraulic<br>
power pack capable of providing bidirectional hydraulic pressure<br>

mover (4) with remote control  (.12), the said ram and power pack<br>
being enclosed in a casing (6) having removably fixed means (5)<br>
at the sides of the casing for holding and means (1) at its<br>
bottom capable of absorbing thrust/shock, the said prime mover<br>
being fixed on to the outer surface of the said casing (6), the<br>
top end of the said ram being connected to known chuck (10), the<br>
said chuck having a removably fixed drill rod (1.1) with drill bit<br>

capable of providing rotation to the said chuck at variable<br>
speeds„<br>
2,	An improved device as claimed in claim 1 whereing the<br>
