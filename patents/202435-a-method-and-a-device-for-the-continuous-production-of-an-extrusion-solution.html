				<td>The present invention relates to a method and a device for the continuous production of an extrusion solution for the formation of cellulose molded bodies, such as fibers and films, according to the lyocell method. The present invention also relates to a device for performing the method.<br>
A discontinuous method for producing a suspension of cellulose in aqueous aminoxide is known from WO 94/28217. In this case, shredded cellulose and an aminoxide solution are mixed in a horizontal mixing chamber by a rotor having radial stirring elements. Twenty-one minutes is given as the duration for one batch. This mode of operation is disadvantageous because, due to the continuous feeding of the subsequent dissolving stage, two such mixing chambers have to be operated. In addition, the complete emptying of the mixing chambers is connected with difficulties.<br>
A semicontinuous method for producing a cellulose solution is known from WO 96/33302. In this case, first a suspension of the cellulose in aminoxide solution is formed, from which water is evaporated before the production of the cellulose solution in a separate apparatus. It is disadvantageous in this case that the cellulose activation in the aqueous aminoxide solution is limited and a separate thermal step is necessary for concentration. The soluble components of the pulp reach the spinning solution and may lead to disadvantageous properties of the cellulose products.<br>
The Indian equivalent IN/PCT/2001/00223/CHE (WO 0009563) concerns a method for the continuous production of a cellulose-NMNO-suspension of constant quality in spite of varying moisture content and varying mean particle size. The method comprises a) homogenization and shearing of the cellulose without NMNO, b) addition of NMNO and subsequent shearing in order to obtain a weight to weight concentration of 70 to 80% NMNO in the liquid wherein the treated materials essentially completely fill out the conduit cross section while passing the shearing zones. The application concerns a method for the continuous production of an extrusion solution for the lyocell process according to claim 1. It differs from this prior art document in the following additional features: I) A preliminary shearing of aqueous cellulose with a weight to weight relation of pulp to water in the range of 1:3 to 1:40 (claim I a)), II) Subsequent partial removal of water in connection with partial recycling of said removed water in the previous step (claim I b)), III) concluding evaporation in connection with shearing of the aqueous NMNO-cellulose-solution (claim I e)). The method according to the application thus achieves the following (6th paragraph): 1) impurity separation, 2) increased solubility and speed of dissolving of the cellulose pulp, 3) reduced consumption of thermal energy for water separation, 4) reduced thermal stress of the aminoxide and cellulose. In addition the danger of local overheating is decreased, the consumption of liquid in step I) a can be lowered by partial recycling and the reaction control is more accurate (description, 17* paragraph). Thus the application"s method relates to the specific lyocell-process, method parameters are given in detail and three additional steps are described in claim one. WO 0009563 concerns the production of aqeous NMNO-cellulose-solutions in general. The goals mentioned in the application are neither disclosed nor can they be derived from the information disclosed within this document.<br><br>
Furthermore, producing a cellulose suspension in aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) by mixing the shredded cellulose directly in an annular layer mixer with the aqueous, e.g. 7 5 mass-percent NMMO is known from WO 96/33221. The suspension produced is brought to solution in a separate Filmtruder. It is disadvantageous in the annular layer mixer that only shredded, essentially dry cellulose may be used. If the cellulose contains water, the layer formation in the mixer and the mixing with the separately added NMMO solution is made more difficult. The water must be thermally separated in this case as well. The same disadvantages exist as in the method described in WO 96/33302. Since the suspension is transported as a layer, the throughput related to the apparatus cross-section is low.<br>
Suspending the pulp before the formation of a homogeneous suspension in aminoxide solution in water and separating it again partially from the suspension agent after a certain time is known from German Patent 198 37 210.8. Recirculation of the suspension agent is not described.<br>
The present invention has the object of providing a method and a device for the continuous production of an extrusion solution for the formation of cellulosic molded bodies according to the lyocell method, in which the pulp used is activated so that its solubility and speed of dissolving is elevated. In addition, soluble impurities of the pulp are to be partially separated in the method, so that their transition into the extrusion solution is reduced. Furthermore, a method for the continuous production of an extrusion solution for the lyocell method is to be provided which is distinguished by reduced consumption of thermal energy for water separation and by reduced thermal stress of the aminoxide and cellulose. Further advantages result from the following description.<br><br>
These objects are achieved according to the present invention with the method initially described in that<br>
(a)	a cellulose suspension is formed from pulp and an aqueous phase in a mass ratio in the range from 1:3 to 1:40 and maintained for a period of time in the range from 5 to 200 minutes with shearing,<br>
(b)	the cellulose suspension is dewatered to form a material with a cellulose content in the range from 20 to 80 mass-percent and the aqueous phase resulting in this case is at least partially recycled in step (a),<br>
(c)	the damp cellulose material is conveyed, with<br>
homogenization, through a first shear zone in the absence<br>
of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide,<br>
(d)	the homogenized cellulose material is conveyed through a second shear zone after the addition of enough aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide that after mixing a suspension with a content of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide in the liquid phase in a range from 70 to 80 mass-percent results, and<br>
(e)	the cellulose suspension in aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide produced is converted into the extrusion solution by water evaporation with shearing.<br>
In contrast to known methods, in which the pulp is mixed directly with N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO), in the method according to the present invention, a stronger activation and an increase in solubility of the cellulose is achieved by the aminoxide-free steps (a) to (c) , so that the formation of solution in step (e) is accelerated and eased. Soluble attendant materials of the pulp may be washed out and partially removed from the method by the aminoxide-free steps (a) and (b) if only a part of the aqueous phase arising in step (b) is recycled in step (a)<br><br>
and otherwise fresh water is used. Since, according to the present invention, thermal concentration of the cellulose suspension in aqueous NMMO before the step of solution formation is dispensed with, reduced thermal stress of the solution components results. The preferred mass ratio of cellulose/aqueous phase in step (a) is in the range from 1:10 to 1:30. The preferred duration of the shearing treatment of the suspension in step (a) is in the range from 10 to 120 minutes. The preferred cellulose content of the dewatered damp cellulose material in step (b) is in the range from 40 to 60 mass-percent.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, partly the aqueous phase from step (b) and partly fresh water is used for the production of the cellulose suspension in step (a) . The remaining portion of the aqueous phase from step (b) is discarded. Soluble components carried along with the pulp are thus prevented from reaching the spinning solution in too high a proportion. On the other hand, the fine fiber component contained in the aqueous phase from step (b) is at least partially recycled and the loss of cellulose is thus minimized.<br>
An aqueous phase is preferably used in step (a) which may contain soluble components, preferably up to 1 mass-percent .<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the cellulose suspension is dewatered with the aid of vacuum and/or pressure into a fleece and the water content of the fleece is determined with the aid of an infrared moisture measurement and the measured dimension is used to regulate the predetermined pressure parameter and/or the addition of the aqueous NMMO in step (d). Through this regulation, it is possible to continuously  maintain  the  desired  composition  of  the<br><br>
extrusion solution,  so that optimum properties of the extruded cellulosic molded bodies may be obtained.<br>
The production of the cellulose solution is preferably performed in step (e) in a strong shear field with small heat exchange areas up to a NMMO/H20 mol ratio in the range from 1:0.8 to 1:1.2. The energy necessary for water evaporation in this step is predominantly introduced into the viscous solution phase by shearing. In this way, and through the low addition of energy, localized overheating, and thus damage to the components of the extrusion solution, is avoided and the risk of the occurrence of exothermic reaction cycles is avoided. The water evaporation can also be regulated with less danger (runaway reaction) via the shear energy introduced than solely through the supply of heat via exchange surfaces.<br>
In a separate embodiment of the method, the cellulose is enzymatically activated in step (a) or between steps (a) and (b) by treating the cellulose suspension with 0.01 to 10 mass-percent enzyme, in relation to the cellulose, at a temperature in the range between 20 and 70 °C, at a pH value in the range from 3 to 10, and for a duration in the range from 0.1 to 10 hours. The cellulose is more strongly activated for the dissolving procedure by this enzymatic treatment than by the shear treatment in step (a) alone. The dissolving of the cellulose in step (e) is thus accelerated; the cellulose solution formed is less viscous or is more concentrated at the same viscosity. Suitable enzymes (cellulases) are known in the related art, such as Rucolase from the firm Rudolph Chemie or Roglyr 1538 from the firm Rotta GmbH. The enzymatic treatment is particularly performed at 30 to 60 °C and at a pH value of 4.5 to 8 with 0.1 to 3.0 mass-percent cellulase during a period of 0.5 to 2 hours.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the method according to the present invention, at least steps (a) and (b) are performed following the pulp production in the pulp factory. These treatment steps may additionally include the enzymatic treatment. The performance of these- steps during the pulp production has the advantage that the activation is possible with lower outlay than at the fiber or film producer, because apparatuses and experience in pulp treatment with aqueous media are available in the pulp factory. The fiber or film producer obtains a pulp activated according to his specifications, with which he can immediately begin step (c) of the method according to the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the device for performing the method comprises a mixing tank with suspending elements, supply connecting pieces for pulp and aqueous suspension agent and drain connecting pieces for the suspension produced, a separating apparatus connected to the drain connecting pieces for partial separation of the suspension agent from the pulp, a return line for separated suspension agent, which leads from the separating apparatus to the supply connecting pieces for suspension agent on the mixing tank, a shearing apparatus, including a homogenization zone and an adjoining suspending zone, having a first feed connecting piece for pulp from the separation apparatus to the beginning of the homogenization zone, a second feed connecting piece for aqueous solvent at the beginning of the suspending zone, and a drain connecting piece for suspension at the end of the suspending zone, and a concentration and dissolving apparatus, having a feed connecting piece connected to the drain connecting pieces of the shear apparatus described, a solvent outlet connecting piece at the other end, and at least one vapor outlet connecting piece. This facility allows the continuous performance of the method. The individual apparatuses may be differently implemented in<br><br>
this case. A suitable mixing tank for the suspending in aqueous suspension agent may be, for example, a pulper known in the related art. A suitable separating apparatus is preferably a vacuum screen belt press.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the drawing and the examples.<br>
The figure schematically shows a facility for performing the method according to the present invention. A mixing tank 1 is fed pulp via connecting pieces 3. Suspension agent, comprising the aqueous recycled material supplied via a return line 4 and fresh water introduced via line 5, is supplied via connecting pieces 2. The aqueous pulp suspension formed in container 1 reaches a screen belt press 8 via line 7 from connecting pieces 6, on which it is dewatered down to a liquid content of 50 %. The suspension agent separated in this way, which carries along components dissolved from the pulp and fine fiber material, is recycled through return line 4 into mixing tank 1. A part of the recycled material may be discarded through line 9.<br>
The dewatered pulp obtained on screen belt press 8 is supplied in fleece form via funnel 12 to a double shaft apparatus 11. In apparatus 11, multiple shafts having shear and conveyor elements are arranged, of which two shafts 13, 14 are illustrated in the drawing. In a first shear zone, which reaches over approximately the first third of the overall length of both zones, the shafts for the shearing of the aqueous cellulose, introduced are set up. After approximately one-third of the apparatus length, there is a feed opening 15 for the solvent (aqueous NMMO) in the cylinder housing. Air and some water vapor is drawn off through lines 16. The apparatus is connected to the downstream end to a multishaft slusher 18, which is used as a dissolving station, by a tube 17. The suspension is transported by the superstructures of the shafts,  with<br><br>
oncaixxiy ana dissolving of the cellulose, to output connecting pieces 19. Slusher 18 is kept under a partial vacuum by connecting pieces 20, which causes water to evaporate from the suspension and be drawn off from slusher 18. Both apparatuses 11 and 18 are provided with a heating mantle (not shown), so that the desired mixing and/or dissolving temperature may be maintained.<br>
Example 1<br>
70 kg pulp of the type MoDo with 6 % moisture was suspended in a pulper with 1300 1 of completely desalinated water for approximately 10 minutes. A pulp suspension having 5 mass-percent pulp was produced. The suspension was fed at 50 °C and at a speed of 700 kg/h to a vacuum dewatering press, on which the pulp was dewatered to a moisture content of 50 %. 70 kg/h of the damp pulp was fed to the first shear zone of a shear apparatus schematically indicated in the figure. At the beginning of the second shear zone, 236 kg/h of aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide was introduced. The mixture was conveyed through the second shear zone, with the available apparatus cross-section being filled up essentially completely by the media conveyed. The slurry obtained had an NMMO content of 76.3 %. 306 kg/h of slurry was then dewatered further in an evaporator/slusher with a strong shearing field and small heat exchange surfaces until a homogeneous solution with an NMMO/H20 mol ratio of 1:1 was formed. 270 kg/hour of spinning solution with a cellulose content of 12.3 % was obtained, which was drawn off from the aggregate at the temperature of 94.5 °C. The spinning solution could be assessed, as good with reference to the refraction index, the particle content, the particle distribution in the solution, and its zero shear viscosity.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
70 kg of a pulp, which resulted in very poor spinning solution qualities under the method conditions of example 1, was whipped in a turbo slusher in water at 45 °C and a pH value of 7 in a bath ratio of 1:10, and treated with 1.5 mass-percent enzyme, in relation to cellulose, for 1.5 hours. The suspension formed was fed to a vacuum dewatering press at 50 °C and a speed of 700 kg/h. In this way, the pulp was dewatered to a moisture content of 50 %. The further processing of the fleece obtained was the same as an example 1. A spinning solution with good quality features was also obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
34 kg/h of a pulp enzymatically pretreated in the pulp factory (0.5 % cellulase of the type Roglyr 1538 from the firm Rotta GmbH, in relation to cellulose, moisture content 6 %) was metered with the aid of a shredder having a discharge unit into a crusher via a belt weigher. The 34 kg/h was supplied with homogenization to a first shearing zone and, after the addition of 272 kg/h of 76 % NMMO, conveyed through a second shear zone. The resulting slurry had an NMMO content of 76.3 %. The slurry was processed further in the same way as in example 1. The spinning solution had the same good properties as in example 1.<br><br><br>
