				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to certain new chemical entities and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives or solvates useful as potential antidiabetic agents and having antioxidant properties and improved glucose uptake by in vitro skeletal muscle cells.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Diabetes is associated with a variety of metabolic abnormalities, principle among them being hyperglycaemia. The so called syndrome includes hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL, cholesterol and abnormal postprandial lipidemia (Diabetes, 1988, 37, 1597-1607) and atherosclerosis (J. Cardiovasc. Risk 1999, 6(5), 337-346).<br>
Type 1 diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a complex, multifactorial disease involving severe destruction of the insulin producing pancreatic (3 cells. Type 2 diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) typically occurs with older age and obesity (J. Clin. Endocrinol. metab. 1999, 84, 2329-2335). Although glycemic control, insulin treatment and other chemical therapies can control many aspects of diabetes, numerous complications are common and diverse. Diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing various clinical complications that are due to microvascular or macrovascular diseases that includes nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy.<br>
Insulin resistance is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Besides, these patients have elevated serum levels of fatty acids. It appears that control of non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the blood could be an important approach to reduce insulin resistance. Studies on the molecular actions of compounds indicate that thiazolidinediones (potent glucose lowering agents) and fibrates (hypolipidaemic agents) exert their action by activating distinct transcriptional factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) family. The former binds predominantly to PPARy and later to PPARa. There have been reports of many newer compounds that<br><br>
show dual PPARy/a activation (JMC, 2001, 44, 2675-2678; JMC, 2003,46, 1306-1317) and these have shown greater potential in treating type 2 diabetes (WOO 157001).<br>
It has been shown beyond doubt that diabetic subjects exhibit high lipid peroxides and other forms of oxidative stress. (Bratisl Lek Listy, 2000, 101(10) 541-551). In diabetes, oxidative stress seems to be caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), sharp reduction in antioxidant defenses and altered cellular redox status. Consequences of oxidative stress are damage to DNA, lipids, proteins, disruption in cellular homeostasis and accumulation of vascular damages.<br>
It has been known that supplementation with an antioxidant is a promising complementary treatment which exerts beneficial effects in diabetes and provides further support for implication of oxidative stress in beta cell dysfunction in diabetes (Diabetes, 1999, 48(12) 2398-2406). Targeting therapy to specific tissues and organs of diabetes by specific antioxidants or combined drug preparations could become a relevant adjuvant pharmacotherapy with improved glycemic control, blood pressure control and management of dyslipidaemia for the treatment or prevention of progression of micro and macro vascular diabetic complications. The molecular mechanism supports that prolonged oxidative stress impairs insulin induced GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Diabetes, 1998, 47, 1562-1569).<br>
Based on the results of King's college in UK, antioxidants such as vitamins C, E and N-acetylcysteine are recommended as supplement in diabetes therapy (Doctor's guide, April 20, 1998) and antioxidants reduces the harmful complications of diabetes (Trends in Endocrinology and metabolism 2001, 12, 179-180). In a previous study, potent ÃŸ- and selective a-adrenoceptor blocker, carvedilol (Drugs of Today 1995, 31(Suppl.F) 1-23) which has carbazol moiety, was found to have very potent antioxidant activity.<br><br>
Besides these, there are some antidiabetic drugs, which have antioxidant properties independently to their main role on glycemia control. Sulfonylureas like gliclazide exhibit antioxidant activity. Some thiazolidinediones are able to possess antioxidant properties. As an example, troglitazone has a combined chemical structure of thiazolidinedione and a-tocopherol like structure (chroman ring). In spite of its beneficial antioxidant moiety, troglitazone was removed from European market due to hepatic dysfunction.<br>
The Applicant focused their attention on designing antioxidant moieties exhibiting superior euglycemic and hypolipidaemic activities. One of the lead compounds was carbazole containing 3-aryl 2-alkoxy propionic acids which was reported to have good dual activity with respect to PPARy and PPARcc (JMC, 2002, 45, 789-904), (WO 0023425).<br>

Pharmacological Methods:<br><br>
1) In vitro glucose uptake:<br>
The final compounds in their suitable salt forms were subjected to glucose<br>
uptake assay in the in vitro skeletal muscle cell lines.<br>
Methodology:<br>
Cell culture:<br>
L6E9   rat  skeletal  muscle   cells  were  proliferated  in  Dulbeccos  Modified<br>
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% Fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (Penicillin 100 lU/ml, Streptomycin 100Âµg/ml) for 2 days. Differentiation was initiated by shifting 70% confluent cells to DMEM supplemented with 2% Horse Serum (HS) for 4 days (fully differentiated) at 37Â°C in 5% CO2 incubator. Differentiation medium was changed daily. Pioglitazone and respective drug compounds were added during last 24 hrs of differentiation. All the compounds were tested at 50ÂµM concentration.<br>
2-Deoxy - D-glucose-1- 3H uptake:<br>
Media in the differentiated cells was changed 1 hr before the start of experiment. The cells were washed twice with the Krebs Ringer Phosphate buffer (KRP): lOmM phosphate (pH 7.2), 136 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KC1, 1.25mM CaCl2, 1.25mM MgSO4 containing 0.05% BSA. The cells were further incubated twice with KRP buffer at 37Â° for 30 min. After washing with KRP buffer, DOG (0.2ÂµCi/ml and lÂµM of unlabelled 2-deoxyglucose) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS three times and solubilized in 0.1N NaOH. Protein concentration was measured in each sample by BCA method (Smith et al, Anal. Biochem. 1985, 150, 76-85) followed by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Results:<br>
To determine the effect of test compounds on basal glucose uptake of normally differentiated skeletal muscle cells in culture, pioglitazone was used as the reference drug. Our test compounds registered between the range of 25-60% increase in glucose uptake as compared to the basal level while pioglitazone showed 35% increase in glucose uptake. This shows that our compounds are close to or better than pioglitazone reference standards<br><br>
as far as glucose uptake is concerned hence indicating that they are capable of reducing hyperglycemic condition. A few representative examples are given below.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2) Lipid Peroxidation:<br>
The evaluation of antioxidant activity of compounds was done by measurement of lipid peroxidation<br>
Principle: Lipid peroxidation is a complex process involving the formation and propagation of lipid radicals, the uptake of oxygen, a rearrangement of double bonds in unsaturated lipids and eventual disruption of biological membrane function. The aerobic incubation of rat brain homogenates with agents known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) like ferrous chloride and ascorbate. These induce the process of lipid peroxidation, leading to the formation of degradation products of peroxidized lipids including malondialdehyde, which then reacts with thiobarbituric acid to yield a pink color, read spectrophotometrically at absorption maximum wave length of 535 nm and taken as an index of lipid peroxidation.<br>
The test compounds depending upon their solubility, were dissolved/diluted in distilled water, DMSO or alcohol to give the final concentration in the ranges of nM to ÂµM for in vitro study. 6-8 concentrations of each compound were tried.<br>
Methodology<br>
Preparation of rat brain homogenates<br>
The male SD rats weighing 280-350g were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were immediately taken out and cleaned with ice cold 0.9% saline. Whole brain except cerebellum was homogenized with a polytron homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold saline. Then, homogenate volume was adjusted/diluted with ice-cold saline so as to give a final concentration of 10 mg/0.8ml and frozen as aliquots at -20Â°C, if studied later (with in 2 days). Measurement of lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate The rates of membrane lipid peroxidation were measured by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The rat brain homogenates (10 mg tissue/0.8ml) were incubated at 37Â°C for 15 min with different concentrations (at least 6 concentrations) of 10Âµl of a test compound or vehicle. Lipid peroxidation was initiated by addition of 0.1 ml each of 0.25 mM of FeCl2 and 1 mM ascorbic acid. A final volume of 1 ml reaction mixture was further incubated for 30 min. at 37Â°C in water bath and then the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of 0.2% butylated hydroxytoluene. Thiobarbituric acid (0.67%) (TBA) reagent, 1 ml was then added and the mixture heated for 30 min at 95Â°C in water bath. The mixture then cooled on ice for 5 min. The TBARS were extracted by adding 2.0 ml of n-butanol and vortexed well for a minute and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm and the 1 ml aliquot of n-butanol phase was taken for measuring absorbance at 535 nm. Reactions without TBA were taken as blank. The antioxidant activity of test compounds was determined as percent inhibition of TBARS formation from the control absorbance values (i.e. in the absence of the test compound ) which is assumed as 100%. The reference compound used is a well known antioxidant, Trolox.<br>
Statistical Analysis:<br>
'Me data were represented as mean Â± SEM. A sigmoidal curve was plotted as<br>
percent inhibition vs log concentration and IC50 (inhibitory concentration at<br>
which occurs 50% inhibition of TBARS formation) value for each compound<br>
was found out by nonlinear regression curve fitting using Graph Pad Prism<br>
software.<br>
Antioxidant activity of some representative compounds are given below.<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
IC50 (ÂµM) values of different compounds with antioxidant property represents inhibitory concentration at which occurs 50% inhibition of TEARS formation. Each measurement was the average of 2 or 3 experiments performed in duplicates.<br>
The results in the table show that all the above compounds can be considered to be antioxidants. But among them, those showing lesser values<br><br>
than  the  known  antioxidant,  Trolox  ,  are  considered  to  be very  highly antioxidants.<br>
