				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
This invention relates to a process for reducing variation in distribution of coal<br>
water slurry through the distributor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The development of large scale coal preparation plants led to the requirement<br>
for the subdivision of solid / liquid slurries at a number of stages. The sub-<br>
division of slurry feed to a number of unit operations in parallel (e.g., cyclones,<br>
spirals and flotation units) is usually accomplished using multi-port distributors,<br>
which can have a wide range of shape and dimensions. A typical sputnik multi-<br>
port distributor comprises two separated parts, the upper chamber and the lower<br>
chamber. The upper chamber is mainly used to enhance the mixing process<br>
through the vortex motion, while the lower chamber directs the coal slurry form<br>
the top to the outlets at the bottom. The distributor insert is designed in the<br>
form of a frustum to push the coal slurry into these outlets.<br><br>
Desirable performance of the distributor is unbiased coal slurry output from all in<br>
the outlets. However biased distributors have been reported from coal<br>
preparation plants. Since the distributor is the first stage of the coal preparation<br>
process, the biased distributions have serious effect on the overall performance<br>
of the coal preparation plant, leading to a serious economic loss. The biased sub-<br>
division of slurry fed to a number of unit operating in parallel would cause each<br>
unit to operate under different separation density, volumetric flow-rate, feed<br>
pressure and feed concentration leading to reduced operating efficiencies in<br>
mineral and coal preparation plants.<br>
Thus, there was a need for obtaining unbiased coal slurry output form all the<br>
outlets of the distributor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
reducing variation in distribution of coal water slurry by modifying feed<br>
distribution for feed to the coal preparation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to reduce the bias or non-uniformity in<br>
distribution.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process for reducing variation in<br>
distribution of coal water slurry for the modified distributor that would reduce the<br>
economic losses due to biased distribution of feed to coal preparation plants and<br>
which can be practiced without difficulty.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a<br>
cylindrical insert above the frustum at the center of the distributor in its lower<br>
chamber. The cylindrical insert can be extended upto the tangential water inlets<br>
provided in the upper chamber.<br>
This arrangement is able to arrest formulation of low velocity zones inside the<br>
distributor causing non-uniform distribution of coal particles from the distributor<br>
outlets.<br>
In the present invention four tangential water inlets are provided along with an<br>
inverted "V" shaped feeder to allow the feed to fall peripherally in the distributor<br>
through an annular ring.<br>
This arrangement will further reduce chances of formation of dead zones inside<br>
the distributor and thereby causing non-uniform distribution of coal through the<br>
distributor outlets.<br><br>
Thus the present invention provides a process for reducing variation in<br>
distribution of coal water slurry in coal preparation plants through the distributor,<br>
comprising the steps of providing a cylindrical insert at the center of the<br>
distributor lower chamber; providing tangential water inlets in the upper<br>
chamber; feeding coal from a feeder provided at the top of the distributor for<br>
mixing with water to form coal-water slurry; and directing the coal slurry to a set<br>
of outlet ports using said cylindrical insert for uniform distribution of coal water<br>
slurry.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objects and further advantages residing in the<br>
same wilt be apparent from the following description made with reference to the<br>
non-limiting accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention can now be deserted in detail with the help of the figures of the<br>
accompanying drawing in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the existing design of the sputnik distributor<br>
in a coal washery.<br>
Figure 2 shows the dead zone in the existing design of the<br>
distributor that does not participate in the mixing process.<br><br>
Figures 3(a)<br>
(b), 3(c)<br>
and 3(d) show the reporting of different size of coal<br>
particles through different ports of the distributor.<br>
Figure 4 shows the velocity contours in the design of the<br>
distributor of the present invention<br>
Figure 5 shows the design of the distributor of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A typical sputnik multi-port distributor as shown in Figure 1. The distributor<br>
comprises an upper chamber 2 used for feeding coal through a feeder 3 and for<br>
enhancing the mixing of coal, with water fed through tangential water inlets 4<br>
using the vortex motion. The distributor is also provided with a lower chamber<br>
for directing the coal slurry from the top to the outlet ports 6. A distributor<br>
insert 7 is provided, in the form of a frustum for pushing the coal slurry into<br>
onlet ports 6.<br><br>
As described earlier, there have been reports of biased or non-uniforms<br>
distribution of coal slurry from the distributor outlets. The problem was studied<br>
and the variation of solids flow through different outlets and the variation in size<br>
distribution were calculated using two indices the coal split ratio and the<br>
variation index. To calculate the variation index, the difference between the<br>
maximum percentage and minimum weight percentage of particles of the<br>
particular size reporting from the outlets are added. The coal split ratio is<br>
calculated as the ratio of maximum solids flow in any outlet to minimum solids<br>
flow in another outlet in g / min.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in CFD simulations there exists a low velocity zone at the<br>
center to the distributor, which is a dead zone and which does not take part in<br>
mixing activity. The major bias in size distribution is observed in the distribution<br>
of coarse coal i.e. + 10 mm (in outlets 1 and 5 - outlets directly below the water<br>
inlet) since their trajectories were mostly affected by gravitational force. Hence,<br>
once caught into the water flow the particles entered the central low velocity<br>
zone and went down the port below as shown in Figures 3 (a), 3 (b), 3 (c) and<br>
(d). The path of fine particles followed the water flow and they got discharged<br>
with water. They were greatly influenced by turbulence.<br>
It was noticed that though the water splits were uniform, there was a significant<br>
variation in particle distribution. Therefore, alternate designs had to be explored.<br><br>
The non-uniform distribution of coal particles from the outlets could be expected<br>
because of the existence of tow velocity regions. Generally the particles are<br>
likely to deposit in the low velocity region. In order to arrest these core low<br>
velocity regions, various new designs were explored like redesigning the insert.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 a cylindrical insert 17 is used in the present invention. This<br>
insert 17 can be placed over the frustum 17' of the lower chamber 15 of the<br>
distributor 10 of the present invention.<br>
The design of a combination of the cylinder and the frustum was able to arrest<br>
the formation of low velocity zone inside the distributor 10 as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The cylindrical insert 17 can be extended upto the top of tangential water inlets<br>
14.<br>
An inverted V feeder 13' is provided below a coal feeder 13 for distributing the<br>
coal in an annular ring in the distributor 10 which allows the feed to fall<br>
peripherally.<br>
It was observed that letting the feed fall peripherally in the distributor further<br>
reduced the chance of formation of the dead zone. The summary of the test<br>
results with modified inserts and feeding position are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1: Result showing the value* of (I) variation index and (II) coal split<br>
ratio in the present and modified design of the distributor.<br><br>
The least variation index and the coal split ratio were obtained at the optimum<br>
conditions (Test 12 in Table 1).<br>
Four water inlets 14 with equal water flow in two opposites inlets were used. A<br>
cylindrical insert 17 was provided above a frustum 17 as a combination central<br>
insert. Symmetrically arranged outlets ports 16 were used. A lower turbulence,<br>
a higher volume percentage of solids (20 %) and the particles falling in an<br>
annular ring in the distributor 10 were used. As can be seen, the new insert<br>
design and distribution in an annular ring have resulted in better distribution of<br>
coal particles at higher volume percentage of solids. The new design of the<br>
distributor 10 of the present invention is shown in Figure 5.<br>
In the present invention the economic losses to variation in coal distributor are<br>
reduced. The composite yield from the dense media cyclone increases as a<br>
result of addition of the viscosity modifier.<br><br>
