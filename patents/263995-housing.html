A housing<br>
The invention relates to a differential current converter for a residual-current circuit breaker,<br>
comprising a preferably annular magnet core, at least one conductor loop such as a secondary<br>
winding and/or tertiary winding and a housing made of several parts and of insulating material.<br>
Magnet assemblies are a part of differential current converters as are used in residual-current<br>
circuit breakers. The magnetic core or its housing is looped by primary windings which are<br>
connected with terminals and the contacts of a drum controller when applied in a residual-current<br>
circuit breaker. The secondary winding and/or tertiary winding arranged on the magnetic core or<br>
its housing are connected with electronic components or modules within the circuit breaker. In<br>
accordance with conventional designs of such residual-current circuit breakers, the connection to<br>
the modules of the residual-current circuit breaker occurs by means of wires which are used for<br>
the windings themselves and which are usually relatively thin and flexible because a large<br>
number of windings can thus be applied to the magnetic core without encumbering the same in a<br>
mechanical way. Furthermore, by using thin wires it is possible to keep the mass, the dimensions<br>
and the costs of a residual-current circuit breaker at a low level.<br>
The disadvantageous aspect in such an embodiment of the connection of the secondary winding<br>
and/or the tertiary winding with the modules of a residual-current circuit breaker is that as a<br>
result of the small diameter and the high flexibility of the used wires they will cause problems in<br>
automated production. The ends of such thin wires do not represent a defined position for<br>
automated production machines as a result of the insufficient dimensional stability of the wires.<br>
Even slight deviations from the actual position of a wire end from the pre-programmed position<br>
will lead to the consequence that the automated production machine will no longer find the wire<br>
end, as a result of which a connection of the secondary winding and/or the tertiary winding with<br>
the modules of a residual-current circuit breaker is no longer possible. The connection of the<br>
secondary winding and/or tertiary winding with the modules therefore occurs in a mostly manual<br>
manner. This leads to high costs and high failure rates in production.<br>
A magnet core housing assembly with a two-part housing is known from EP 650 172 A, wherein<br>
lead-through openings for the primary conductors are provided in the two-part housing. The<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
2<br>
individual housing shells comprise plug-in connections which are arranged as hollow lead-<br>
through openings in which primary conductors are guided. As a result of this and as a result of<br>
screening elements provided on the face side of the housing, the insulation between the primary<br>
conductors can be ensured without the same having to be insulated themselves.<br>
US Pat. No. 2 290 680 A describes toroidal core coil for phone applications, in which a housing<br>
is provided for an annular magnet core, which housing is composed of shell halves and made of<br>
insulating material. Said housing carries webs with connecting contacts for the ends of the coil<br>
wires wound about said housing.<br>
AT 395 492 B further describes an electric coil for filter applications and for mounting printed<br>
boards which consist of a coil body with winding, with the connecting wires of an electronic<br>
component being clamped to the base of the coil body, which wires are each connected on their<br>
part to the connecting wires of the winding.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a housing for magnet assemblies for<br>
differential current converters for residual-current circuit breakers of the kind mentioned above<br>
with which the mentioned disadvantages can be avoided and which allow an improvement in<br>
automated production of residual-current circuit breakers.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that at least two conductive<br>
contacts are formed on the housing to which the ends of the conductor loop are connected, and<br>
that the conductive contacts are arranged as connecting conductors of at least one electronic<br>
component.<br>
The automated production machines are thus provided with defined end points which can be<br>
accessed by the same with the required precision. A higher degree of automation can thus be<br>
achieved in the production of residual-current circuit breakers, thus lowering the production<br>
costs and rejection rate. By using a component that is contacted by the secondary winding and/or<br>
tertiary winding anyway, special contacts can be omitted, which allows reducing the production<br>
costs and production time even further.<br>
It can be provided in a further development of the invention that at least one support is provided<br>
for the at least one electronic component, preferably on at least one of the outer housing surfaces.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
This allows arranging the at least one component directly on the housing of the magnetic core<br>
and thus as close as possible to the wires of the secondary winding and/or tertiary winding to be<br>
contacted, as a result of which the wires protruding from the winding have a minimum length.<br>
In this connection it can be provided for in a further development of the invention that the at least<br>
one support is formed integrally on the housing. This leads to a simple and cost-effective<br>
production of the housing and the support.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the support comprises<br>
at least two partial supports arranged on different housing shells. The position of the at least one<br>
component can be defined in a more precise manner by the two partial supports.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the supports comprise<br>
at least one guide aid, preferably a sloped portion. The at least one component can thus be<br>
introduced in a more simple way into the support. This is also advantageous when using<br>
automated production machines.<br>
One variant of the invention is that the support is provided for electronic components preferably<br>
wired in an axial or radial manner such as resistors, capacitors or diodes. Especially capacitors<br>
and diodes are components which are commonly used in residual-current circuit breakers for<br>
rectifier and energy-storage circuits and which are arranged closest to the secondary winding<br>
and/or tertiary winding.<br>
In a further embodiment it can be provided that the support is provided for a plurality of<br>
components, preferably two thereof, which are connected to an assembly of components. As a<br>
result, components that are used anyway in a circuit assembly with the same connection points<br>
can also be arranged together, which ensures that functional modules are not separated. This has<br>
an advantageous effect on the length of the signal paths and thus on the noise immunity of the<br>
components.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the connecting conductors of the<br>
component assembly are connected at their ends. A mechanical as well as electrically conductive<br>
component assembly is thus formed in a simple way.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
4<br>
Another possible embodiment can be that at least one preferably plate-shaped screening element<br>
is provided which is especially formed in an integral manner. This allows the screening of the<br>
secondary winding and/or tertiary winding and the electronic components of conductors of the<br>
primary winding. Furthermore, the at least one screening element can be used as a stop or<br>
defined end for the secondary winding and/or tertiary winding or for an electronic component.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the support is arrested<br>
on connecting conductors of the at least one electronic component and/or the component<br>
assembly. Components with different outside dimensions might thus be introduced into identical<br>
supports. This further simplifies the configuration of the support in the case of two partial<br>
supports which are each arranged on identical housing shells. Since the position of the<br>
connecting conductors takes precedence for making contact between the components, their<br>
position can be defined in a very precise manner in this way.<br>
In this connection it can be provided in a further development of the invention that the support is<br>
a tooth-shaped projection with a receptacle. Such supports offer a high amount of stability.<br>
It can be provided for in a further development of the invention that the support comprises at<br>
least one arresting device, especially a latch hook. The at least one component can thus be<br>
arrested in a simple and custom-fit manner.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the electronic<br>
component wired axially or radially is arranged substantially parallel to the outer housing surface<br>
which is arranged substantially as a cylinder jacket surface. As a result, the ends of the<br>
connecting conductors are situated close to the ends of the secondary winding and/or tertiary<br>
winding and can thus make contact over a short distance.<br>
One variant of the invention is that the connecting conductors form a clamping region<br>
cooperating with the support. In this way the components can be arranged on a simple and secure<br>
manner on the housing of the magnet assembly.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the partial<br>
supports comprises a U-shaped basic body with a leg and web connecting the same. A support<br>
which is provided with a simple and stable configuration is thus formed.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the legs of the U-<br>
shaped basic body are formed by plate-shaped screening elements. Components and modules<br>
already provided are thus used in multiple ways, which thus reduces the overall production work<br>
in connection with the housing and/or the support.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that a preferably plate-<br>
shaped clamping and/or guide element which is especially formed integrally with the housing is<br>
arranged parallel to at least one leg on the outside of the U-shaped basic body, with the leg and<br>
the clamping and/or guide element forming a clamping and/or guide region for clamping and/or<br>
guiding the connecting conductors of at least one electronic component. The position of the<br>
connecting conductors of the at least one electronic component can thus be determined precisely.<br>
Furthermore, the at least one electronic component can thus be optionally clamped to its<br>
connecting conductors.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the web of the U-<br>
shaped basic body is arranged as a plane plate which is preferably formed in an integral manner<br>
on the housing. The plate-shaped web forms a secure stop for the at least one electronic<br>
component.<br>
One variant of the invention can be that the web is arranged parallel to the cover surface and/or<br>
the outer cylinder jacket surface edge. This ensures that at least one electronic component is<br>
arranged parallel to the cover surface and/or the outer cylinder jacket surface edge. This<br>
simplifies setting the automated component insertion machines.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the webs of two partial supports<br>
which jointly form one support are parallel with respect to each other and/or form a receiving<br>
region. As a result, the housings which are parallel in most electronic components can thus be<br>
received in a secure manner.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the receiving area for receiving<br>
at least one electronic component, preferably a component assembly, is provided. An electronic<br>
component or a component assembly can thus be arranged on the housing.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
A further possible embodiment can be that the connecting conductors of the at least one<br>
electronic component wired axially or radially are arranged substantially parallel to the outer<br>
housing surface which is arranged substantially as a cylinder jacket surface. The ends of the<br>
connecting conductors are thus situated close to the ends of the secondary winding and/or tertiary<br>
winding and contact can thus be made over a short distance.<br>
One variant of the invention can be that at least one component, preferably a component<br>
assembly, is arranged in the support, with a secondary winding and/or tertiary winding of the<br>
differential current converter being arranged via the support. The at least one electronic<br>
component can thus be simply be secured in its position by means of a device, namely the<br>
secondary winding and/or tertiary winding, which is provided anyway on the magnet assembly.<br>

Fig. 8 shows a farther axonometric view of a housing according to Fig. 6, and<br>
Fig. 9 shows a further axonometric view of a housing according to Fig. 6.<br>
Figs. 1 to 9 show different views of especially preferred embodiments of a housing 20 for a<br>
magnet assembly 1, e.g. for receiving a preferably annular magnet core 2 of a differential current<br>
converter of a residual-current circuit breaker, with the housing 20 consisting of several parts and<br>
being configured from an insulation material and at least two conductive contacts 5 being formed<br>
on the housing 20 for connecting the ends 6 of at least one conductor loop 3 such as a secondary<br>
winding and/or a tertiary winding 4 of the differential current converter, and with the conductive<br>
contacts 5 being arranged as connecting conductors 8 of at least one electronic component 9.<br>
Magnet assemblies 1 are used in current converters of electric switchgears, especially residual-<br>
current circuit breakers. They comprise a magnet core 2 which is formed in preferred<br>
embodiments by an annular magnet core 2 with rectangular cross section. The magnet core 2 is<br>
looped by primary windings when the current converter is installed in a residual-current circuit<br>
breaker, which primary windings are connected with the input and output terminals and with<br>
contacts of a drum controller. The primary windings loop the cross section of magnet core 2<br>
typically once or one and a half times. The number of primary windings corresponds to the<br>
number of conductors of the network to be protected, which is usually two or four.<br>
If the outgoing current does not correspond to the incoming current, a voltage is induced in the<br>
secondary winding 4 by the difference and the residual-current circuit breaker will trip. Any<br>
provided tertiary winding 4 is used for recognizing short transient excess voltages, which may be<br>
caused by lightning stroke, and prevents false tripping of the residual-current circuit breaker on<br>
the occurrence of such short transient excess voltages.<br>
The secondary winding and/or tertiary winding 4 can thus be applied directly to the magnet core<br>
2. At least one opening for leading through the wires 7 should be provided in this case in the<br><br>
7	<br>
housing, or, as is shown in Figs. 2 to 5 and Figs. 7 to 9, on the housing 20. It can also be<br>
provided that one of the conductor loops 3 or windings is provided on the magnet core 2 and one<br>
on the housing 20.<br>
The magnet core 2 is provided with a housing 20 especially for protection against mechanical<br>
loads, which housing consists of an insulator, preferably made of plastic.<br>
The magnet core 2 or the cross section of the magnet core 2 is looped or wound about by a<br>
conductor loop 3, preferably a secondary winding and/or tertiary winding 4. It can be applied<br>
directly to the magnet core 2 or the housing 20. Since the secondary winding and/or tertiary<br>
winding 4 usually consist of a very thin and respectively flexible wire 7, the ends 6 of the<br>
windings or the conductor loop 3 represent a problem for automatic manufacturing machines<br>
because such thin wires 7 which show very little stiffness and which project from the winding<br>
can hardly be grasped or contacted by automatic manufacturing machines. That is why it is<br>
provided to connect the ends 6 of the secondary winding and/or tertiary winding 4 directly with<br>
the conductive contacts 5 in the region of the housing 20, which contacts are provided with a stiff<br>
and massive configuration and have a definite length, so that the same represent defined end<br>
points which can be accessed by an automatic manufacturing machine in a purposeful manner<br>
and which do not deform excessively under access of this automatic production machine.<br>
It is provided that the conductive contacts 5 are arranged as connecting conductors 8 of at least<br>
one electronic component 9, as a result of which the connecting conductors 8 which are present<br>
anyway in components 9 of the residual-current circuit breaker fulfill the further purpose in<br>
addition to their functional tasks to act as a contact for the ends 6 of the secondary winding<br>
and/or tertiary winding 4.<br>
The housing 20 of the preferred embodiments of a magnet assembly 1 in accordance with the<br>
invention is divided into two parts, with both housing shells 21 having the same configuration. It<br>
is possible however to use all other embodiments of a housing 20 for a magnet assembly 1. By<br>
providing the same arrangement of the two housing shells 21 they can be produced with merely<br>
one tool, as a result of which the production costs for the housing 20 can be lowered.<br>
Each housing shell 21 of the preferred embodiments has an outer cylinder jacket surface 22 and<br>
an inner cylinder jacket surface 23, as well as a cover surface 24, with the outer cylinder jacket<br>
surface 22 and the inner cylinder jacket surface 23 being delimited on one side by the cover<br><br>
8<br>
surface 24 and forming on the other side on outer cylinder jacket surface edge 25 and an inner<br>
cylinder jacket surface edge 26. The three surfaces form a cavity 27 which is provided for<br>
receiving the magnet core 2. On the outer side 28 of the outer cylinder jacket surface 22 which is<br>
opposite of the cavity 27, at least one support 29 or partial support 30, at least one screening<br>
element 31 and at least one connecting element 32 are arranged which are preferably all attached<br>
in an integral manner.<br>
The connecting elements 32 are preferably arranged as diametrically opposed connecting<br>
elements 32. Any desired number of connecting elements 32 can be provided. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, two first connecting elements 33 and two second connecting elements 34 are<br>
provided which are diametrically opposed to said first connecting elements 33 and which are<br>
arranged on the outer side 28 of the outer cylinder jacket surface 22 in such a way that when two<br>
similar housing shells 21 are pressed together in the position as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 6, i.e. in<br>
a position facing each other where the cavities 27 of the two housing shells 21 are combined into<br>
a common cavity, the first connecting elements 33 will interact with the second connecting<br>
elements 34 and will hold the same tightly. It is therefore provided in the preferred embodiments<br>
that the first connecting elements 33 comprise pin-like elevations 35 and the second connecting<br>
elements 34 will comprise diametrically opposite receiving openings 36 which are slightly<br>
narrower, and that the first connecting means 33 and the second connecting means 34 are<br>
arranged close to the outer cylinder jacket surface edge 25. It is possible to provide any other<br>
kind of connecting elements 32, e.g. a bayonet catch.<br>
It is provided in the preferred embodiments of the housing 20 that the same comprises preferably<br>
two screening elements 31 which are preferably provided with a plate-like configuration. The<br>
screening elements 31 are arranged on the two housing shells 21 in such a way that they will<br>
form a continuous screening element 31 when the housing 20 is assembled. The preferably two<br>
screening elements 31 are subsequently also used as a stop for a conductor loop arranged on the<br>
housing 20, such as a secondary winding and/or tertiary winding 4.<br>
At least one support 29 for the at least one electronic component 9 is arranged on the housing 20,<br>
preferably on at least one outer housing surface 45. In the preferred embodiments, the support 29<br>
is formed by two partial supports 30, with one partial support 30 each being arranged on a<br>
housing shell 21.<br><br>
9<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the support 29 is provided for axially or radially wired electronic<br>
components 10 such as resistors, capacitors or diodes 16. Especially capacitors and diodes 16 are<br>
components 9, 10 which are commonly used in residual-current circuit breakers for rectifier and<br>
energy-storage circuits and which are arranged closest to the secondary winding and/or tertiary<br>
winding 4.<br>
Diodes 16 further preferably contact the tertiary winding 4 in a parallel counter-polar<br>
arrangement as shown in Figs. 2 to 5 and 7 to 9, which is used for recognizing short transient<br>
processes.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a housing 20 in accordance with the invention and Figs. 1 to 5 will<br>
be described in closer detail below.<br>
The support 29 or the partial supports 30 are arranged in a first preferred embodiment in<br>
accordance with the invention in that at least one axially or radially wired electronic component<br>
10 is arranged substantially parallel to the outer housing surface 45 which is arranged<br>
substantially as a cylinder jacket surface 22.<br>
The partial supports 30 are preferably arranged as a tooth-shaped projection 37 with a receptacle<br>
38. The tooth-shaped projection 37 has a substantially rectangular cross section and protrudes<br>
from the outer cylinder jacket surface 22 or is normal to the same, with the concrete position<br>
depending on the outside diameters of the electronic components 9, 10 to be received. In the first<br>
preferred embodiment as shown in Fig. 1 to 5, the partial supports 30 are arranged in such a way<br>
that they have a distance from the outer cylinder jacket surface edge 25 which is at least larger<br>
than half the housing length of the electronic component 9,10 to be received.<br>
The partial supports 30 comprise sloping portions 39 which facilitate the receiving of electronic<br>
components 9, 10 in the supports 29. In the first preferred embodiment, the tooth-shaped partial<br>
supports 30 comprise two sloping portions 39 which have a common edge 40. One of the two<br>
sloping portions 39 converges into an arresting device 41, especially a latch hook 24. In addition<br>
to or instead of the latch hook 42 it is possible to provide any other arresting device 41.<br>
The arresting device 41 can be used both for arresting the housing of an electronic component 9,<br>
10 as well as for arresting the connecting conductor 8 of an electronic component 9,10, as in the<br>
first preferred embodiment.<br><br>
10<br>
In the first preferred embodiment, the support 29 is provided for receiving several, preferably<br>
two, electronic components 9, 10 which are joined into a component assembly 11. Preferably,<br>
two electronic components 9, 10 are conductively connected with each other at the ends 12 of<br>
their connecting conductors 8, preferably welded or soldered, with the connecting conductor 8<br>
forming a clamping region 15 cooperating with the support 29. As in the first preferred<br>
embodiment as shown in Figs. 1 to 5, it can be formed by two substantially parallel connecting<br>
conductors 8, with the connecting conductors 8 having a double bend 13. The clamping region<br>
15 can also be arranged as a tapering clamping region 15, in the case when the connecting<br>
conductors 8 do not have a double bend 13.<br>
The support 29 or the partial supports 30 are arranged within the clamping region 15 and the<br>
arresting device 41 secures the component assembly 11 against changes in position. The holding<br>
force is supplied by the spring effect of the connecting conductors 8 of the electronic<br>
components 9, 10 joined into a component assembly 11. The support 29 or partial supports 30<br>
have the smallest width 44 in the region of the receptacle 38, which width is larger than the<br>
distance 14 of two connecting conductors 8 which jointly form a clamping region 15. A secure<br>
fastening of the component assembly 11 is thus ensured.<br>
Insofar as no components 9, 10 are provided which are connected directly to a secondary<br>
winding and/or tertiary winding 4, it also possible to introduce into the support 29 respectively<br>
bent wires or zero ohm bridges or, when feedthrough is undesirable, respectively plastic parts<br>

A second preferred embodiment of a housing 20 in accordance with the invention will be<br>
described below in closer detail.<br>
The basic structure of the housing 20 is identical to the first preferred embodiment of a housing<br>
20 in accordance with the invention as described above. The first and second preferred<br>
embodiment of the housing 20 merely differs with respect to the embodiment of the support 29<br>
or partial supports 30, and with respect to the preferred arrangement of the connecting conductor<br>
8 of the at least one electronic component 9 or the component assembly 11.<br>
In the second described preferred embodiment, the at least one partial support 30 comprises a U-<br>
shaped basic body 50, comprising a leg 51 and a web 52 connecting the same. It is preferably<br><br>
11<br>
provided that the partial support 30 is made from an insulating material and is attached integrally<br>
to the housing 20.<br>
The legs 51 of the U-shaped basic body 50 of the partial support are preferably formed by plate-<br>
like screening elements 31 which do not extend up to the outer cylinder jacket surface 22, but<br>
merely up to the web 52 of the U-shaped basic body 50. The plate-like screening elements 31<br>
extend preferably substantially parallel to the outer housing surface 45 which is substantially<br>
arranged as a cylinder jacket surface 22. The legs 51 preferably extend outwardly from the outer<br>
housing surface 45 at least to such an extent that they protrude beyond the at least one electronic<br>
component 9.<br>
The two legs 51 of the U-shaped basic body 50 are preferably joined by a web 52 which is<br>
arranged as a plane plate. It can also be provided to provide a number of pin-like elevations<br>
instead of the web 52. The web 52 is preferably arranged parallel to the cover surface 24 and/or<br>
the outer cylinder jacket surface edge 25, with the cover surface 24 and the outer cylinder jacket<br>
surface edge 25 being parallel with respect to each other in the preferred embodiment of housing<br>
20.<br>
Web 52 preferably protrudes to such an extent from the outer housing surface 45 that the same<br>
projects beyond the at least one electronic component 9, with the legs 51 rising above the web 52<br>
in a preferable way and as shown in Figs. 6 to 9. It can be provided that the web 52 and the legs<br>
51 are not joined into a modular unit and are each arranged separately.<br>
It can be provided that parallel to at least one leg 51 a clamping and/or guide element 53 is<br>
arranged on the outside of the U-shaped basic body 50, which element is preferably plate-shaped<br>
and is especially attached integrally to the housing 20, with the leg 51 and the clamping and/or<br>
guide element 53 forming a clamping and/or guide region 54 for clamping and/or guiding the<br>
connecting conductors 8 of the at least one electronic component 9.<br>
In the especially preferred variant, the second preferred embodiment of a housing 20 in<br>
accordance with the invention comprises such as a clamping and/or guide element 53 parallel to<br>
each leg 51. Such an embodiment, as is shown in Figs. 6 to 9, comprises a clamping and/or guide<br>
region 54 on either side of the legs 51 of the U-shaped basic body 50.<br><br>
12<br>
A support 30 of the second preferred embodiment of the housing 20 is preferably formed by two<br>
partial supports 30 arranged on different housing shells 21. The webs 52 of the two partial<br>
supports 30 are preferably arranged parallel with respect to each other and form a receiving<br>
region 55 which is provided for receiving at least one electronic component 9 or a component<br>
assembly 11. As already explained above, the electronic components 9 provided preferably for<br>
arrangement in a support 29 of a housing 20 in accordance with the invention concern diodes and<br>
capacitors, with all known electronic components 9 being capable of being provided however. It<br>
is known that electronic components 9 can be available with identical electric properties in<br>
different designs. Figs. 6 to 9 illustrate the arrangement of a component assembly 11 of axially<br>
wired components 10 in a second preferred embodiment of a housing 20 in accordance with the<br>
invention. It can be provided however to arrange other wired components 9 such as radially<br>
wired components or components with lens-like housing in the support. It can be provided<br>
according to the shape of the housing of the electronic components 9 to be received that the<br>
configuration of the receiving region 55 is adjusted accordingly. As a result, the web 52 can be<br>
omitted in the case of an intended arrangement of components 9 with lens-like housings, with the<br>
components 9 being arrested on the end points of the legs 51.<br>
It can be provided that the connecting conductors 8 of the at least one electronic component 10<br>
which is wired axially or radially is arranged substantially parallel to the outer housing surface<br>
45 which is arranged substantially as a cylinder jacket surface 22. The connecting conductors 8<br>
are preferably arranged in such a way that they are also substantially parallel with respect to each<br>
other. In the especially preferred embodiment it is provided that the ends 12 of the connecting<br>
conductors 8 are all arranged directly adjacent to a cover surface 24.<br>
It can be provided that the electronic components 9 which are arranged in the support 29 are held<br>
by clamping the connecting conductors 8 in the clamping and/or guide region 54. It can also be<br>
provided that the clamping and/or guide region 54 is merely used for guiding the connecting<br>
conductors 8. Apart from this it is preferably provided to arrange a secondary winding and/or<br>
tertiary winding 4 of the differential current converter via the components 8 arranged in the<br>
support 29 or via the component assembly 11. The secondary winding and/or tertiary winding 4<br>
secures in this manner the components 9 or the component assembly 11 from falling out of the<br>
support 29. Furthermore, the shortest possible connection of the secondary winding and/or<br>
tertiary winding 4 to the ends 12 of the connecting conductors 8 is thus ensured.<br><br>
13<br>
A combination of some or all features of the described first and second preferred embodiment of<br>
a housing 20 in accordance with the invention can be provided.<br>
A random combination of all disclosed features can be provided. It can also be provided to omit<br>
any one of the disclosed features.<br><br>
