According to present invention, plastic film capacitors are manufactured by winding into a cylinder any dielectric plastic film and any electrode. Fig 1 shows a wounded capacitor coil(l). Fig 2 shows the cross sectional area of a wound capacitor coil(l). As shown in figure2 eletrodes( 2 ) are placed between dielectric films (3 ). After winding, capacitor coils(l) are kept in air ventilated oven for heat treatment for 5 hrs. at a temperature 110°C and then end spray metallisation( 4 ) is done for tennination contact Fig 3 shows a capacitor coil with end spray metallisation. Then the lead wires (5) are soldered / welded to the ends of the sprayed coil for inaking termination contact Figure 4 shows the wound capacitor coil with end spray metallisation and termination soldered. Tennination/ lead wires ( 5 ) and welding/soldering contacts (6) are shown in figure 4. After this these capacitor coils (1) are kept in air-ventilated oven at a temperature between 85 to 107°C for a time period 1 to 2 hours for preheating. Then the amine based epoxy ( 7) containing amine based resin and hardener in the ratio of 100:72.5 and having the property of becoming solid at temperature of 100°C is taken and said epoxy is kept under vacuum to remove air in the epoxy. The resin used in the present invention is ETH-30 and hardener used is ETRF-30. Preheated capacitor coils are men immersed in said epoxy for impregnation under vacuum for a period of 10 to 15 minutes. During the epoxy impregnation processes under vacuum, epoxy penetrates into the capacitor coil and fills up the air voids / pockets and seals the capacitor coil for protection from atmosphere and improves the breakdown voltage since air pockets odierwise damage the plastic film during its usage in field conditions. Figure 5 shows the said epoxy impregnated capacitor coil Figure 6 shows the cross sectional area of the epoxy impregnated capacitor coil After impregnation these coils are kept in an air ventilated oven at a temperature of 107 °C for drying of the said epoxy. After drying, the impregnated coils are encapsulated. Figure 7 shows me flow chart of the process of present invention as discussed in the above description of the invention.<br><br>
Best mode of carrying out invention:<br>
