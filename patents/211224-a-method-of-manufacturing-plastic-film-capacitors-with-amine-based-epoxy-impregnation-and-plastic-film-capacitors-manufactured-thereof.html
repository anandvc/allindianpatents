Detailed description of the invention<br>
The above, and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Meaning of the reference numerals used in the drawings are as follows:<br>
1.-Wound capacitor coil<br>
2.- Electrodes<br>
3.- Dielectric film<br>
4.- End spray metallisation<br>
5.- Lead wires<br>

According to present invention, plastic film capacitors are manufactured by winding into a cylinder any dielectric plastic film and any electrode. Fig 1 shows a wounded capacitor coil(l). Fig 2 shows the cross sectional area of a wound capacitor coil(l). As shown in figure2 eletrodes( 2 ) are placed between dielectric films (3 ). After winding, capacitor coils(l) are kept in air ventilated oven for heat treatment for 5 hrs. at a temperature 110Â°C and then end spray metallisation( 4 ) is done for tennination contact Fig 3 shows a capacitor coil with end spray metallisation. Then the lead wires (5) are soldered / welded to the ends of the sprayed coil for inaking termination contact Figure 4 shows the wound capacitor coil with end spray metallisation and termination soldered. Tennination/ lead wires ( 5 ) and welding/soldering contacts (6) are shown in figure 4. After this these capacitor coils (1) are kept in air-ventilated oven at a temperature between 85 to 107Â°C for a time period 1 to 2 hours for preheating. Then the amine based epoxy ( 7) containing amine based resin and hardener in the ratio of 100:72.5 and having the property of becoming solid at temperature of 100Â°C is taken and said epoxy is kept under vacuum to remove air in the epoxy. The resin used in the present invention is ETH-30 and hardener used is ETRF-30. Preheated capacitor coils are men immersed in said epoxy for impregnation under vacuum for a period of 10 to 15 minutes. During the epoxy impregnation processes under vacuum, epoxy penetrates into the capacitor coil and fills up the air voids / pockets and seals the capacitor coil for protection from atmosphere and improves the breakdown voltage since air pockets odierwise damage the plastic film during its usage in field conditions. Figure 5 shows the said epoxy impregnated capacitor coil Figure 6 shows the cross sectional area of the epoxy impregnated capacitor coil After impregnation these coils are kept in an air ventilated oven at a temperature of 107 Â°C for drying of the said epoxy. After drying, the impregnated coils are encapsulated. Figure 7 shows me flow chart of the process of present invention as discussed in the above description of the invention.<br><br>
Best mode of carrying out invention:<br>
First a plastic dielectric film is placed in vacuum and a thin layers of metal alloy as an electrode is deposited on it Then a metallised film is wound into a cylinder so mat a metallised edge extends on each end of the wound capacitor section. Then these capacitor coils are kept in air ventilated oven for 5 hrs. for heat treatment Then both ends are sprayed with small droplets of molten metal that adhere along &amp; make contact with the metallisation on the film. Then the wire lead is soldered/welded to this end sprayed metallised portion for making termination contact There after the capacitor coil is preheated by keeping it in air ventilated oven at the temperature of 85Â° C for time period of 2 Hours. Then the amine based epoxy containing amine base resin and hardener in the ratio of 100:72.5 and which having property of getting solid at temperature of 100 Â°C is taken and said epoxy is kept under vacuum to remove the excess air inside the epoxy. The hardener used in the present invention is ETH-30 and resin used is ETRF-30. The preheated capacitor coils are then immersed in said epoxy for impregnation under vacuum for a period of 15 minutes. During the epoxy impregnation process under vacuum epoxy will penetrate inside me capacitor coil and fillup the air pockets and seal the capacitor coil to protect from atmosphere and improves breakdown voltage since air pockets otherwise damage the plastic film during its usage in field condition. After impregnation these coils are kept in the air ventilated oven at a temperature of 107 Â°C for drying of said epoxy. After drying, the impregnated coils are encapsulated and sealed.<br><br>
