				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of unsymmetrically disubstituted cycloalkanones. In particular this invention describes a process for the preparation of unsymmetrically disubstituted 2,6 -cyclohexanones/2,5 -disubstituted cyclopentanones; the substituents being 4-hydroxy benzylidene on one position and 4-cyano/nitro benzylidene on the other. More particularly it relates to the preparation of 2-(4-hydroxy benzylidene)-6-(4-cyano/nitro benzylidene)cyclohexanones, 2-{4-hydroxy benzylidene)-6 - (40cyano/nitro benzylidene)4 -methylcyclohexanones and 2-(4-hydroxy benzylidene)-5- (4-cyano/nitro benzylidene)cyclopentanones having general formula 1 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-; X = cyano and nitro.<br>
The compounds prepared by the process of this invention are useful for the preparation of mesogens that would find applications in the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The compounds prepared by the process of this invention namely 2-(4-hydroxy benzylidene)-5 or 6-(4-cyano/nitro benzylidene) cycloalkanones are new.<br>
Hitherto there are no known process of making unsymmetrically disubstituted cycloalkanones and symmetrically disubstituted cycloalkanones are obtained.<br>
The mesogens prepared by the process of this invention are based on 2 - (aryl-1-methylene) cycloalkanones of formula 2 wherein R = nil,  -CH2-,  -CH(CH3)-; X = cyano and nitro.  In our copending<br>
application number NF 183/96, we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of 2 -(aryl-1-hydroxy methylene) cyclcalkanones.<br>
Yesogens prepared as per the process of this invention are compounds which form part of the polymeric structure in liquid crystalline polymers. If the mesogens form part of the backbone of the polymers, then the polymers are known as main chain liquid crystalline polymers and if it is in the form of pendant groups along the backbone of the polymers, then the polymers are referred to as side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The mesogens prepared as per the process of this invention are therefore useful for the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers that could be used for non-linear optical applications.<br>
The mesogens prepared by the process of this invention, can be further hooked throucgh the hydroxy group using polymethylene . polyoxymethylene/polyoxyethylene spacers to a polymer backbone. The polymer backbone chosen could be from acrylic, methacrylic, scyreneic, epichlorohydrin, maleimide, 2,2-bis(chloromethyl) crimethyleneoxy, vinyl alcohol, vinyl chloride to prepare side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The side chain liquid crystalline polymers prepared are useful for non-linear optical applications.<br>
Alternately, the mesogen could hooked through the hydroxy group using  polymethylene/polyoxymethylene/polyoxyethylene  spacer  to<br>
vinyl monomer selected from acrylic, methacrylic, styreneic, epichlorohydrin, maleimide, 2,2-bis(chloromethyl) oxitane and such like. The monomer can then be subsequently polymerised to prepare side chain liquid crystalline polymer useful for non¬linear optical applications.<br>
The need for newer materials for use in non-linear optical application is strongly felt by researchers. The need is desired by those involved in the developmental efforts for optical signaling manipulation, parallel optical image processing systems in the wake of developments in the area of fibre optics. The material development is directed towards materials with non¬linear optical properties.<br>
It is known that response factor to radiation is linear so long as intensity of radiation is weak. However, in the presence of intense source such as the laser, non-linear effects are detectable. Materials with large non-linear optical coefficients are desired for applications in the areas of electro-optical switching, higher data storage devices and the like. The other characteristic feature of these materials is fast response times required for processing desired device structures.<br>
Properties that are critical for materials to qualify for non¬linear optical applications include transparency, thermal, photochemical and chemical stability, dielectric constant etc. Both inorganic and organic salts exhibit non-linear optical properties. Materials that have been extensively used in the area<br>
applied external field is removed. During this process the dipolar species in the polymer film would reorient and a net alignment is retained in the film.<br>
For a polymer to be useful for non-linear optical applications, it must satisfy primary optical property requirements. The primary optical property is characterized by the material having substantially transparency to light of desired frequency.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of unsymmetrically disubstituted cycloalkanones. Disubstituted mesogens with extended conjugation with electron donor group at one end and electron acceptor group at the other end are useful in the preparation of side chain liquid polymers for non-linear optical applications.<br>

The reaction was then cooled to ambient temperature and diluted with 200 ml of pentane, washed with 300 ml of cold aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer was then washed with cold 1.5 N hydrochloric acid. The resulting organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure and distilled under vacuum to get 32 gram of colourless 4-methyl-l-trimethyl silyloxy-1-cyclohexene.<br>
1.40 gram of 4-methyl-1-trimethyl silyloxy-1-cyclohexene was mixed with 0.94 gram of 4-cyano benzaldehyde and 0.24 gram of sulphated zirconia in 40 ml of dichloromethane. A nitrogen atmosphere was maintained. The reactants were stirred at a temperature of 50°C for 36 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered to recover the solid catalyst. The filtrate was washed with distilled water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resultant mass was then chromatographed through a silica gel column using a petroleum ether : acetone mixture (5:1 V/V) as the eluent to get the pure 2- (4-cyano phenyl- 1 - hydroxy methylene)-4-methyl cyclohexanone. The yield obtained was 1.56 gram.<br>
