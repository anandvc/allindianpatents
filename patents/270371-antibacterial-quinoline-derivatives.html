it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>

ANTIBACTERIAL QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline derivatives useful for the 5     treatment of bacterial diseases, including but not limited to diseases caused by<br>
pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium andM. marinum, or pathogenic Staphylococci or Streptococci<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis' (TB), a serious and potentially fatal infection with a world-wide distribution. Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that more than 8 million people contract TB each year, and 2 million people die from tuberculosis yearly. In the last decade, TB cases have<br>
15     grown 20% worldwide with the highest burden in the most impoverished communities. If these trends continue, TB incidence will increase by 41% in the next twenty years. Fifty years since the introduction of an effective chemotherapy, TB remains after AIDS, the leading infectious cause of adult mortality in the world. Complicating the TB epidemic is the rising tide of multi-drug- resistant strains, and the deadly symbiosis<br>
20     with HIV. People who are HIV-positive and infected with TB are 30 times more likely to develop active TB than people who are HTV-negative and TB is responsible for the death of one out of every three people with HIV/AIDS worldwide<br>
Existing approaches to treatment of tuberculosis all involve the combination of multiple 25     agents. For example, the regimen recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further four months. These drugs are continued for a further seven months in patients infected with HIV. For patients infected with multiÂ¬drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, agents such as ethambutol, streptomycin, 30     kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ciprofoxacin and<br>
ofloxacin are added to the combination therapies. There exists no single agent that is effective in the clinical treatment of tuberculosis, nor any combination of agents that offers the possibility of therapy of less than six months' duration.<br>
35     There is a high medical need for new drugs that improve current treatment by enabling regimens that facilitate patient and provider compliance. Shorter regimens and those that require less supervision are the best way to achieve this. Most of the benefit from<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
treatment comes in the first 2 months, during the intensive, or bactericidal, phase when four drugs are given together; the bacterial burden is greatly reduced, and patients become noninfectious. The 4- to 6-month continuation, or sterilizing, phase is required to eliminate persisting bacilli and to minimize the risk of relapse. A potent sterilizing 5     drug that shortens treatment to 2 months or less would be extremely beneficial. Drugs that facilitate compliance by requiring less intensive supervision also are needed. Obviously, a compound that reduces both the total length of treatment and the frequency of drug administration would provide the greatest benefit.<br>
10     Complicating the TB epidemic is the increasing incidence of multi-drug- resistant<br>
strains or MDR-TB. Up to four percent of all cases worldwide are considered MDR-TB - those resistant to the most effective drugs of the four-drug standard, isoniazid and rifampin. MDR-TB is lethal when untreated and cannot be adequately treated through the standard therapy, so treatment requires up to 2 years of "second-line" drugs. These<br>
15     drugs are often toxic, expensive and marginally effective. In the absence of an effective therapy, infectious MDR-TB patients continue to spread the disease, producing new infections with MDR-TB strains. There is a high medical need for a new drug with a new mechanism of action, which is likely to demonstrate activity against drug resistant, in particular MDR strains.<br>
20<br>
The term "drug resistant" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter is a term well understood by the person skilled in microbiology. A drug resistant Mycobacterium is a Mycobacterium which is no longer susceptible to at least one previously effective drug; which has developed the ability to withstand antibiotic attack by at least one previously<br>
25     effective drug. A drug resistant strain may relay that ability to withstand to its progeny. Said resistance may be due to random genetic mutations in the bacterial cell that alters its sensitivity to a single drug or to different drugs.<br>
MDR tuberculosis is a specific form of drug resistant tuberculosis due to a bacterium resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs),<br>
30     which are at present the two most powerful anti-TB drugs. Thus, whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter "drug resistant" includes multi drug resistant.<br>
Another factor in the control of the TB epidemic is the problem of latent TB. In spite of decades of tuberculosis (TB) control programs, about 2 billion people are infected by 35     M. tuberculosis, though asymptomatically. About 10% of these individuals are at risk of developing active TB during their lifespan. The global epidemic of TB'is fuelled by infection of HIV patients with TB and rise of multi-drug resistant TB strains<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/063312<br><br>
(MDR-TB). The reactivation of latent TB is a high risk factor for disease development and accounts for 32% deaths in HIV infected individuals. To control TB epidemic, the need is to discover new drugs that can kill dormant or latent bacilli. The dormant TB can get reactivated to cause disease by several factors like suppression of host 5     immunity by use of immunosuppressive agents like antibodies against tumor necrosis factor a or interferon-?. In case of HIV positive patients the only prophylactic treatment available for latent TB is two- three months regimens of rifampicin, pyrazinamide.   The efficacy of the treatment regime is still not clear and furthermore the length of the treatments is an important constrain in resource-limited environments.<br>
10     Hence there is a drastic need to identify new drugs, which can act as chemoprophylatic agents for individuals harboring latent TB bacilli.<br>
The tubercle bacilli enter healthy individuals by inhalation; they are phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages of the lungs. This leads to potent immune response and formation of granulomas, which consist of macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis<br>
15     surrounded by T cells. After a period of 6-8 weeks the host immune response cause death of infected cells by necrosis and accumulation of caseous material with certain extracellular bacilli, surrounded by macrophages, epitheloid cells and layers of lymphoid tissue at the periphery. In case of healthy individuals, most of the mycobacteria are killed in these environments but a small proportion of bacilli still<br>
20     survive and are thought to exist in a non-replicating, hypometabolic state and are tolerant to killing by anti-TB drugs like isoniazid. These bacilli can remain in the altered physiological environments even for individual's lifetime without showing any clinical symptoms of disease. However, in 10% of the cases these latent bacilli may reactivate to cause disease. One of the hypothesis about development of these<br>
25     persistent bacteria is patho-physiological environment in human lesions namely,<br>
reduced oxygen tension, nutrient limitation, and acidic pH. These factors have been postulated to render these bacteria phenotypically tolerant to major anti-mycobacterial drugs.<br>
30     In addition to the management of the TB epidemic, there is the emerging problem of resistance to first-line antibiotic agents. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
35     The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by<br>
resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods of infectivity, which<br><br>
WO 2008/06S266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial 5     use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or 10     may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for 15     microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems 20     worldwide.<br>
Therefore, there is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially mycobacterial infections including drug resistant and latent mycobacterial infections, and also other bacterial infections especially those caused by resistant 25     bacterial strains.<br>
WO2004/011436, WO2005/070924, WO2005/070430 and WO2005/075428 disclose certain substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. WO2005/117875 describes substituted<br>
30     quinoline derivatives having activity against resistant Mycobacterial strains.<br>
WO2006/067048 describes substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against latent tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307, 223-227 and its mode of action is described in WO2006/035051.<br>
35<br>
Other substituted quinolines are disclosed in US-5,965,572 (The United States of America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO00/34265 to inhibit the<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
growth of bacterial microorganisms.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, in particular substituted quinoline derivatives, having the property of inhibiting bacterial growth 5     especially of Streptococci, Staphylococci or mycobacteria and therefore useful for the treatment of bacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent disease and including drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains), M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium andM. marinum.<br>
10     The compounds according to the present invention are characterized by the presence of a unsaturated carbon chain attached to the 3-position of the quinoline nucleus and thus have a different basic structure to the quinoline derivatives described in the above-mentioned prior art documents. The compounds according to the present invention therefore have the advantage that they are able to form fewer enantiomers. The<br>
15     compounds of the present invention show not only activity against mycobacterial<br>
strains, but they also have improved activity against other bacterial strains, especially against Streptococci and/or Staphylococci.<br><br>

The term pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt also comprises the quaternary ammonium salts (quaternary amines) which the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (la) or (lb) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted<br>
35     Ci-6alkylhalide, arylCi-ealkylhalide, Ci-fialkylcarbonylhalide, arylcarbonylhalide, HetCi-ealkylhalide or Hetcarbonylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Preferably, Het represents a monocyclic heterocycle selected from furanyl or thienyl; or<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
a bicyclic heterocycle selected from benzofuranyl or benzothienyl; each monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycle may optionally be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents, each substituent independently selected from the group of halo, alkyl and aryl. Preferably, the quatemizing agent is Ci^alkylhalide. Other reactants with good leaving groups 5     may also be used, such as Ci^alkyltrifluoromethanesulfonates, Ci^alkyl<br>
methanesulfonates, and Ci_6alkyl/?-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate, acetate, triflate, sulfate, sulfonate. Preferably, the counterion is iodo. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange 10     resins.<br>

In the framework of this application, a compound according to the invention is inherently intended to comprise all stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (la) and (lb), and their<br>
20     iV-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on<br>
25      bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-<br>
configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person.skilled in the art. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) and (lb) are<br>
30     obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (la) or (lb) which are stereochemically pure.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known 35     absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [i?*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R *,R *] indicates centers with the same chirality and [R *,S* ] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would 5     be specified as S-[R*,S*]. If "a" and "p" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent 10     on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "p", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
When a specific stereoisomeric form is indicated, this means that said form is<br>
15     substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5 %, further preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomer(s). Thus, when a compound of formula (la) or (lb) is for instance specified as (E), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (Z) isomer.<br>
20<br>
In particular, in view of the fact that the compounds of formula (la) or (lb) contain in substituent Q at least 1 double bond, the compounds can have an E configuration at that double bond, they can have a Z configuration at that double bond or they can be a mixture of E and Z configuration at that double bond. Preferably, the compound of<br>
25     formula (la) or (lb) as defined hereinbefore or hereinafter has a particular configuration at that double bond (substantially free of the other configuration). Compounds of formula (la) or (lb) wherein Q is a radical of formula (a-2) or (a-3) also contain at least one chiral center, i.e. the carbon atom attaching substituent Q to the quinoline moiety. These compounds can have R configuration at that carbon atom, S<br>
30     configuration at that carbon atom or they can be a mixture of R and S at that carbon atom. Preferably, the compound of formula (la) or (lb) as defined hereinbefore or hereinafter has a particular configuration at that carbon atom (substantially free of the other configuration).<br>
35     The compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) may be synthesized in the form of<br>
mixtures, in particular racemic mixtures, of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of<br><br>
vVO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
either formula (la) and (lb) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. S&amp;id diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective of fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the 5     enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (lb) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospeciflcally. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will 10     be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The tautomeric forms of tha compounds <sf formula or are meant to campri.se those compounds of wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto tautomerism tautomeric forms the and intermediates present invention intended be embraced by ambit this invention.></sf>
The iV-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of 20     formula (la) or (lb) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) and (lb) may be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into<br>
25     its A^-oxide form. Said W-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (la) or (lb) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for<br>
30     example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chIorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t.butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such<br>
35     solvents.<br>
In the framework of this application, a compound according to the invention is<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
inherently intended to comprise all isotopic combinations of its chemical elements. In the framework of this application, a chemical element, in particular when mentioned in relation to a compound according to formula (la) or (lb), comprises all isotopes and isotopic mixtures of this element, either naturally occuring or synthetically produced, 5     either with natural abundance or in an isotopically enriched form. In particular, when hydrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to lH, 2H, 3H and mixtures thereof; when carbon is mentioned, it is understood to refer to MC, 12C, l3C, ,4C and mixtures thereof; when nitrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 13N, 14N, 15N and mixtures thereof; when oxygen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 140,150,160, 10     170,180 and mixtures thereof; and when fluor is mentioned, it is understood to refer to i8F, i9F and mixtures thereof.<br>
A compound according to the invention therefore inherently comprises a compound with one or more isotopes of one or more element, and mixtures thereof, including a radioactive compound, also called radio labelled compound, wherein one or more non-15     radioactive atoms has been replaced by one of its radioactive isotopes. By the term "radiolabelled compound" is meant any compound according to formula (la) or (lb), a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof or an JV-oxide form thereof or a solvate thereof, which contains at least one radioactive atom. For example, a compound can be labelled with positron or with gamma emitting radioactive isotopes. For radioligand-20     binding techniques (membrane receptor assay), the H-atom or the    I-atom is the atom of choice to be replaced.   For imaging, the most commonly used positron emitting (PET) radioactive isotopes are nC, l8F, 150 and 13N, all of which are accelerator produced and have half-lives of 20, 100, 2 and 10 minutes respectively. Since the half-lives of these radioactive isotopes are so short, it is only feasible to use 25     them at institutions which have an accelerator on site for their production, thus limiting their use. The most widely used of these are I8F, ""Tc, 201T1 and 121I. The handling of these radioactive isotopes, their production, isolation and incorporation in a molecule are known to the skilled person.<br>
In particular, the radioactive atom is selected from the group of hydrogen, carbon, 30     nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen and halogen. Preferably, the radioactive atom is selected from the group of hydrogen, carbon and halogen.<br>

The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly been shown to be suitable for the treatment of a bacterial infection including a mycobacterial infection, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the latent and drug resistant form thereof), M. bovis, M. avium,<br>
15     M. leprae and M. marinum. The present invention thus also relates to compounds of formula (la) or (lb) as defined hereinabove, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or the iV-oxide forms thereof or the solvates thereof, for use as a medicine, in particular for use as a medicine for the treatment of a bacterial infection including a mycobacterial infection.<br>
20<br>
Further, the present invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (la) or (lb), the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or the JV-oxide forms thereof or the solvates thereof, as well as any of the pharmaceutical compositions thereof as described hereinafter for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a bacterial<br>
25     infection including a mycobacterial infection.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient suffering from, or at risk of, a bacterial infection, including a mycobacterial infection,<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention.<br>
In addition to their activity against mycobacteria, the compounds according to the 5     invention are also active against other bacteria. In general, bacterial pathogens may be classified as either gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens. Antibiotic compounds with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens are generally regarded as having a broad spectrum of activity. The compounds of the present invention are regarded as active against gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacterial 10     pathogens, in particular against gram-positive bacterial pathogens. In particular, the present compounds are active against at least one gram-positive bacterium, preferably against several gram-positive bacteria, more preferably against one or more gram-positive bacteria and/or one or more gram-negative bacteria.<br>
15     The present compounds have bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity.<br>
Examples of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, include Staphylococci, for example S. aureus; Enterococci, for example E.faecalis; Streptococci, for example S. pneumoniae^ S. mutans, S. pyogens; Bacilli, for example<br>
20     Bacillus subtilis; Listeria, for example Listeria monocytogenes; Haemophilus, for example H. influenza; Moraxella, for example M. catarrkalis; Pseudomonas, for example Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Escherichia, for example E. coli. Gram-positive pathogens, for example Staphylococci, Enterococci and Streptococci are particularly important because of the development of resistant strains which are both<br>
25     difficult to treat and difficult to eradicate from for example a hospital environment once established. Examples of such strains are methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multiple resistant Enterococcus faecium.<br>
30     The compounds of the present invention also show activity against resistant bacterial strains.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are especially active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, including resistant Staphylococcus aureus 35     such as for example methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).<br><br>

Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient suffering from, or at risk of, a bacterial infection, including an infection caused by Staphylococci and/or Streptococci, which comprises administering to the patient a 10     therapeutically effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention.<br>
Without being bound to any theory, it is taught that the activity of the present compounds lies in inhibition of the FIFO ATP synthase, in particular the inhibition of<br>
15     the FO complex of the FIFO ATP synthase, more in particular the inhibition of subunit c of the FO complex of the FIFO ATP synthase, leading to killing of the bacteria by depletion of the cellular ATP levels of the bacteria. Therefore, in particular, the compounds of the present invention are active on those bacteria of which the viability depends on proper functioning of FIFO ATP synthase.<br>
20<br>
Bacterial infections which may be treated by the present compounds include, for example, central nervous system infections, external ear infections, infections of the middle ear, such as acute otitis media, infections of the cranial sinuses, eye infections, infections of the oral cavity, such as infections of the teeth, gums and mucosa, upper<br>
25     respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, genitourinary infections, gastrointestinal infections, gynaecological infections, septicemia, bone and joint infections, skin and skin structure infections, bacterial endocarditis, burns, antibacterial prophylaxis of surgery, and antibacterial prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients, such as patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, or organ transplant patients.<br>
30<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter, that the compounds can treat a bacterial infection it is meant that the compounds can treat an infection with one or more bacterial strains.<br>
35     The invention also relates to a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention. The compounds according to the invention may be<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt 5     form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the<br>
10     compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be<br>
employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets.<br>
15     Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in<br>
20     which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations.<br>
25<br>
Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight, even more preferably from 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the active ingredient(s), and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, more preferably from 30 to 99.9 % by weight, even<br>
30     more preferably from 50 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may additionally contain various other ingredients known in the art, for example, a lubricant, stabilising agent, buffering agent, 35     emulsifying agent, viscosity-regulating agent, surfactant, preservative, flavouring or colorant.<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated 5     to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required<br>
pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The daily dosage of the compound according to the invention will, of course, vary with 10     the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the mycobacterial disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compound according to the invention is administered at a daily dosage not exceeding 1 gram, e.g. in the range from 10 to 50 mg/kg body weight.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Of some compounds or intermediates the absolute stereochemical configuration of the stereogenic carbon atom(s) therein or the configuration at the double bond was not 20     experimentally determined. In those cases the stereochemically isomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" isomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by a person skilled in the art, using art-known<br><br>
WO 2008/068266<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063312<br><br>
methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction orNMR. It is considered to be within the knowledge of the skilled person to recognize the most appropriate method to determine the actual stereochemical configuration.<br>
In case "A" and "B" are stereoisomeric mixtures, in particular mixtures of enantiomers, 5     they can be further separated whereby the respective first fractions isolated are<br>
designated "Al" respectively "Bl" and the second as "A2" respectively "B2", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "Al", "AT and "Bl", "B2" isomeric forms, in particular said "Al", "A2" and "Bl", "B2"enantiomeric forms, can be unambiguously characterized by a person skilled in<br>
10     the art, using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br>
For example, an intermediate of formula (Il-a), (II-b), (II-c) or (Il-d) is indicated as a particular diastereoisomer (substantially free of the other diastereoisomer(s)). In case said intermediate of formula (Il-a), (II-b), (II-c) or (Il-d) has two chiral centers this means that the intermediate is a mixture, in particular a racemic mixture of the (R,S)<br>
15     and (S,R) enantiomers or a racemic mixture of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomer.<br>
Hereinafter, the mixtures of 2 enantiomers are indicated as diastereoisomer A or B. Whether the mixture is indicated as A or B depends on whether it is first isolated in the synthesis protocol (i.e. A) or second (i.e. B). When said intermediate is indicated as a particular enantiomer (substantially free of the other enantiomers), this means that the<br>
20     intermediate is the (R,S), (S,R), (R,R) or (S,S) enantiomer. Hereinafter, said particular enantiomers are indicated as Al, A2, Bl or B2. Whether the enantiomer is indicated as Al, A2, Bl orB2 depends on whether it is isolated first or second (1 or 2) in the synthesis protocol and whether it is separated from the A (Al, A2) or B (Bl, B2) diastereoisomer.<br>
25     In some cases, when an intermediate, indicated as a particular diastereoisomer or<br>
enantiomer, is converted into another intermediate, the latter may inherit the indication for diastereoisomer (A or B) or enantiomer (Al, A2, Bl, B2) from the former. Whenever this applies, this also counts for the final compound.<br>
30     Hereinafter, "DMF" is defined as A^A^-dimethylformamide, "THF" is defined as tetrahydrofuran, "D1PE" is defined as diisopropylether, "DCM" is defined as dichloromethane, "PPA" is defined as polyphosphoric acid.<br><br>

P. Pharmacological examples<br>
D.l. In-vitro method for testing compounds against M. tuberculosis. Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic tnicrotiter plates were filled with 100 jj-i of Middlebrook (lx) broth medium. Subsequently, stock solutions (10 x final test 5     concentration) of compounds were added in 25 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial fiveÂ¬fold dilutions were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). Pipette tips were changed after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds.<br>
10     Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 5000 CFU per well of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37RV), in a volume of 100 \d in Middlebrook (lx) broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The<br>
15     cultures were incubated at 37Â°C for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). One day before the end of incubation, 6 days after inoculation, Resazurin (1:5) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 y.1 and plates were incubated for another 24 hours at 37Â°C. On day 7 the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically.<br>

D.3. In-vitro method for testing compounds for anti-bacterial activity against various non-mvcobacterial strains<br>
Preparation of bacterial suspensions for susceptibility testing: 5     The bacteria used in this study were grown overnight in flasks containing 100 ml<br>
Mueller-Hinton Broth (Becton Dickinson - cat. no. 275730) in sterile de-ionized water, with shaking, at 37 Â°C. Stocks (0.5 ml/tube) were stored at -70 Â°C until use. Bacteria titrations were performed in microtiter plates to detect the TCID5o, in which the TCID50 represents the dilution that gives rise to bacterial growth in 50 % of 10     inoculated cultures.<br>
In general, an inoculum level of approximately 100 TCID50 was used for susceptibility testing.<br>
Anti bacterial Susceptibility testing; IC9&amp; determination<br>

Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were tilled with 180 ul of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes in column 2. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 u.1 in 180 \A) were made directly in the microtiter plates from<br>
20     column 2 to reach column 11. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without<br><br>

(column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Depending on the bacteria type, approximately 10 to 60 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum (100 TCID50), in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without 5     inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hours under a normal atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, one day after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated<br>
10     overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods. The IC90 (expressed in fig/ml) was defined as the 90 % inhibitory<br>
15     concentration for bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 12.<br>
Agar dilution method.<br>
MIC99 values (the minimal concentration for obtaining 99 % inhibition of bacterial growth) can be determined by performing the standard Agar dilution method according 20     to NCCLS standards* wherein the media used includes Mueller-Hinton agar.<br>

Time kill assays<br>
25     Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. In a time kill assay on Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum of 5. aurues and MRSA is 106 CFU / ml in Muller Hinton broth. The antibacterial compounds are used at the concentration of 0.1 to 10 times the MIC(i.e.<br>
30     IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Wells receiving no antibacterial agent constitute the culture growth control. The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 Â°C. After 0, 4,24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10"1 to 10"6) in sterile PBS and plating (200 jxl) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 Â°C for<br>
35 24 hrs and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logioCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The<br><br>

Determination of cellular ATP levels<br>
In order to analyse the change in the total cellular ATP concentration ( using ATP bioluminescence Kit, Roche), assays are carried out by growing a culture of S. aureus (ATCC29213) stock in 100 ml Mueller Hinton flasks and incubate in a shaker-<br>
10     incubator for 24 hrs at 37 Â°C (300 rpm). Measure OD405 nm and calculate the CFU/ml. Dilute the cultures to 1 x 106 CFU/ml (final concentration for ATP measurement: ] x 10s CFU/lOOul per well) and add test compound at 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (i.e. IC90 as determined in microtitre plate assay). Incubate these tubes for 0, 30 and 60 minutes at 300 rpm and 37Â°C. Use 0.6 ml bacterial suspension from the snap-cap tubes and add<br>
15     to a new 2 ml eppendorf tubes. Add 0.6 ml cell lysis reagent ( Roche kit), vortex at max speed and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cool on ice. Let the iuminometer warm up to 30Â°C (Luminoskan Ascent Labsystems with injector). Fill one column (= 6 wells) with 100 jil of the same sample. Add 100 ul Luciferase reagent to each well by using the injector system. Measure the luminescence for 1 sec.<br>
