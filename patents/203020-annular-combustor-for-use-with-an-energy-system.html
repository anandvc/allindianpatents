ANNULAR COMBUSTOR FOR USE WITH AN ENERGY SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to combustors and more particularly, to 5     annular combustors used with an energy system.<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002J This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application No. 60/200,946 filed May 1,2000.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
10	[0003] Combustors are conceptually straightforward devices. They<br>
provide a chamber in which a fuel and an oxidant, such as air, are combined and burned to create hot gases of combustion. In practice, however, designing an efficient combustor is a complex task. In order to extract a maximum available energy from the fuel, and to reduce emissions to a minimum level, a combustor must provide an<br>
15     environment in which complete combustion of the fuel can occur. Provisions must be made to thoroughly mix the fuel and oxidant. Where the fuel to be burned in the combustor is a liquid, such as diesel fuel  rather than a gas such as propane or natural gas, the combustor must also provide some means for atomizing and evaporating the liquid before combustion can occur. The combustor must also include some means<br>
2 0      for igniting the fuel and oxidant mixture, as well as means for mamtaining a stable flame following ignition. Annular combustors for use with energy systems are known, such as that disclosed PCT Application No. PCT/US97/22007, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to provide an annular 2 5     combustor that results in low NOx, CO, and unbumned hydrocarbon emissions, as well as resulting in efficient use of fuel.<br><br>
WO 01/83963<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0015] Figure 1 illustrates an annular combustor 10 in accordance with 2 0     the subject invention connected to a compressor/turbine arrangement 100. The<br>
compressor/turbine arrangement 100 includes compressor blades 102, adiffuser 103, turbine blade nozzle vanes 104, and turbine blades 105 positioned around a rotary drive shaft (not shown), which rotates about a longitudinal axis X. The combustor 10, further illustrated in Figure 2, is comprised of an annular inner shell 15, having an 25     inner surface 17, and an outer surface 19. The combustor 10 furthermore has a co-<br><br>
WO 01/83963<br><br>
PCT/USO1/14115<br><br>
axial annular outer shell 20, having an inner surface 22, and an outer surface 24. A dome end wall 30 connects the inner shell 15 and the outer shell 20, wherein the inner shell 15, the outer shell 20 and the dome end wall 30 define an annular combustion chamber 35, having a chamber width W between the outer surface 19 of the inner 5     shell 15 and the inner surface 22 of the outer shell 20. The chamber 35 extends along the longitudinal axis X, and has an exit end 40 opposite the dome end wall 30. A dam 45 is positioned between the dome end wall 30 and the exit end 40 and extends radially outwardly from the inner shell 15 to define a reduced flow area passageway 50 within the combustion chamber 35.<br>
10<br>
[0016J   It should be appreciated and will be explained further that the dam 45 may extend radially outwardly from the inner shell 15 as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, or, in the alternative, may extend radially inwardly from the outer shell 20, or, in yet another alternative, may extend both radially outwardly from the inner shell 15, and radially inwardly from the outer shell 20.<br>
15<br>
20<br>
[0017]  Returning to Figure 1, within the compressor/turbine arrangement 100, an annular housing wall 108 is provided and defines an air intake passage 110 positioned adjacent to compressor blades 102. An inner housing wall 114, is positioned adjacent to the exit end 40 of the combustor 10 to enclose the combustion chamber 35. The combustion chamber 35, the air path 118 and the turbine blades 105 are in fluid communication with each other. An annular cooling area 119 is defined by a distal end 120 of the forward housing wall 114 and the outer shell 20 of the combustor 10. The annular cooling area 119 allows for more dilution air toward the turbine nozzle vanes 104 and turbine blades 105.<br>
[0018]   Air entering the air intake passage 110 is directed through<br>
2 5     passageway 11S along the exterior surface of the combustor 10, and is introduced into<br>
  the combustion chamber 35 through a number of passageways 125,128,130 and<br>
openings 80 extending through the walls of the combustor and, furthermore, is<br>
introduced to the combustion chamber 35 at the end 120 of passageway 118. A<br>
plurality of fuel/air mixing tubes 132 extends through the wall of the combustor 10 to<br>
4<br><br>
WO 01/83963<br><br>
PCT/US01/14115<br><br>
provide fuel delivery to the primary zone 55 of the chamber 35. The fuel/air mixing tubes 132, which are tubular in shape, are adapted to angularly direct liquid or gas fuel and compressed air or oxygen into the primary zone 55 of the combustor 10. An igniter 140 passes through the combustor 10 and into the combustion chamber 35, 5     where it may ignite the air-fuel mixture within the chamber 55 until the combustion is self-sustaining.<br>
[0019]  Directing attention to Figures 1 and 2, the combustion chamber 35 is comprise of a primary zone 55, a secondary zone 65, and a dilution zone 75. The primary zone 55 is the region within the chamber 35 between the dome end wall 10      30 and the dam 45, The secondary zone 65 is the region within the chamber 35<br>
generally circumferential with the dam 45. The dilution zone 75 is the region within the chamber 35 between the dam 45 and the exit end 40.<br>
 [0020]   As previously discussed, the dam 45 illustrated in Figure 2 extends outwardly from the inner shell 15. It is entirely possible, as illustrated in the 15      schematic in Figure 6, to supplement dam 45 with a second dam 145 which may extend radially inwardly from the outer shell 20 to define a passageway 150. In the alternative, as illustrated in Figure 7, it is possible to entirely eliminate dam 45, such that the sole dam within the combustor 10 is dam 145 extending radially inwardly from the outer shell 20.<br>
20	,   [0021]  Returning to Figure 1, the dam 45 may be comprised of two<br>
distinct part wherein a first part 46, extending from the exit side 47 to the circumferential edge 48 of the dam 45, is positioned adjacent to a second part 49. The dam parts 46,49 may be welded to one another or may be held securely against one another by means of a common anchor plate.<br>
2 5	[0022]   Retxirning to Figure 2, and additionally directing attention to<br>
Figure 3, the dam 45 has a plurality of openings 80 extending therethrough to permit fluid communication between the inner surface 17 of the inner shell 15, and the outer surface 19 of the inner shell 15. The openings 80 may extend radially through the dam 45.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 01/83963<br><br>
PCT/US01/14115<br><br>
[0023]   As illustrated in Figure A, the dam 45 has a circumferential face 82 which may be angled relative to the longitudinal axis X, such that the openings 80 extend toward the exit end 40 of the combustor 10. These circumferential faces 82 may have an angle A between 0 degrees and 80 degrees with 5     the longitudinal axis X thereby directing fluid from the openings 80 toward the exit end 40 of the combustor 10.<br>
[0024]  As illustrated in Figure 3, the radially extending openings SO are spaced apart may provide an interrupted pattern at the front side 85 of the dam 45. As previously mentioned, the dam 45 may be supplemented with a second dam 145 10     as illustrated in Figure 6. Under these circumstances the same features discussed with the single dam 45 may also be implemented. In the alternative, and as previously mentioned, dam 45 may be eliminated such that the single remaining dam is dam 145 and once again similar features may be applied to the single dam 145.<br>
[0025]  The dams 45 and 145 may extend radially from the respective 15     inner shell 15 or outer shell 20 a distance of less then one-half the chamber width W. Preferably, the dams extend a distance of approximately one-third of the chamber width W. It should be appreciated in the instances of one dam extending from each of the inner shell 15 and the outer shell 20, each dam may radially extend the distance approximately one-third of the chamber width W.<br>
20	     [0026]  As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the dam 45 may be an integral<br>
part of the inner shell 15 from which it extends. In actuality, the inner shell 15 is formed to incorporate the shape of the dam 45 and, as a result, the dam is essentially hollow and the openings occur only at the circumferential face 82 of the dam 45.<br>
[0027]  Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment of dam 45. A deflector 25      155 is located along the circumferential edge 48 of the dam 45 such that fluid passing through the dam 45 is deflected toward the exit end 40 of the combustor 10. Under these circumstances the openings SO is in the wall of the dam 45 facing the exit end 40. The deflector assures a smooth uninterrupted flow of secondary air mixing with the primary fuel/air mixture in a direction toward the exit end 40 to assure no<br>
6<br><br>
WO 01/83963<br><br>
PCT/US01/14115<br><br>
secondary air is introduced into the primary zone and furthermore provides a surface to accept the through flow of secondary air in an impinging cooling scheme.<br>
[0028]  Circumferentially spaced slotted sections 145 are provided about the exit end 40 of the outer shell for receipt of an exit wall to direct the products 5     of combustion away from the combustor and toward, for example, the turbine blades. [0029]  In operation, compressed air or oxygen at, for example, 45 psig is provided via a compressor and surrounds the outer surface of the combustor 10. Fuel is directed by a fuel injector 135 toward respective inner surfaces of the angled fuel/air premix tubes 132 (Fig. 5). Compressed air and/"or oxygen also flows into the<br>
10      angled fuel/air premix tubes 132 formmg a rich fuel to air mixture. The angled tubes 132 create a cticumferential swirling action. The fuel/air mixture exits the tubes 132 into the first section at an angle B (Fig. 3). Preferably, the angle B is not great enough to direct the fuel/air or pxygen mixture directly or tangentially against the inner surface of the shell. Preferably, only enough air or oxygen is provided to create a rich<br>
15      fuel mixture. This rich fuel mixture is then ignited by the igniter 140. As combustion takes place, products of combustion (POC) are formed through partial combustion. The POC and other materials then flow toward the dam 45 in this secondary zone 65. Additional compressed air and/or oxygen are directed in a radial direction through passageways 128 resulting in a lean mixture. Further, since the flow area of the<br>
2 0      combustion chamber 45 is reduced in the secondary zone 65, the velocity of the mixture increases over that in the primary zone 55. The resulting mixture in the secondary zone 65 is a lean mixture. Additional combustion takes place and the mixture and POC travel toward dilution zone 75. Dilution air is added into the dilution zone at passageways 125,130 to provide the required turbine inlet<br>
2	5     temperature, and desired low flame pattern factor. The POC"s then leave the dilution<br>
zone 75, and are directed toward turbine blades 105 via the turbine nozzle vanes 104.<br>
[0030]   It is thought the present invention and many of its intended advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and that it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form construction an arrangement<br>
3	0      of the parts thereof, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, or<br>
