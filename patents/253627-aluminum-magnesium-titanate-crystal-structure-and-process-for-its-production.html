				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal structure, particularly to an<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate crystal structure having high<br>
mechanical strength, which can be used continuously and<br>
stably at high temperatures, while maintaining its high<br>
heat resistance, extremely small thermal expansion<br>
coefficient and high corrosion resistance, and to a<br>
process for its production.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Aluminum magnesium titanate is a homogeneous solid<br>
solution formed over the entire compositional range of<br>
aluminum titanate and magnesium titanate. A sintered<br>
product of aluminum magnesium titanate has high heat<br>
resistance, a small thermal expansion coefficient, and<br>
excellent corrosion resistance. The melting point of<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate is about 1,640°C e.g. in the<br>
case of a sintered product wherein aluminum titanate and<br>
magnesium titanate are solid-solubilized in an<br>
approximately equivalent molar ratio. This temperature<br>
is lower when compared with the melting point of aluminum<br><br>
titanate of 1,870°C, but it is higher when compared with<br>
the melting point of magnesium titanate of 1,600°C.<br>
Therefore, in general, the upper limit of heat resistance<br>
of aluminum magnesium titanate is inferior to that of<br>
aluminum titanate, but it is still superior in comparison<br>
with that of magnesium titanate.<br>
On the other hand, an aluminum titanate sintered<br>
product and a magnesium titanate sintered product are,<br>
respectively, constructed from crystal grains having the<br>
pseudobrookite type crystal structure, and their<br>
coefficients of thermal expansion are anisotropic.<br>
Therefore, when heating and cooling are carried out,<br>
slippage by a thermal stress is likely to take place at<br>
the crystalline interface, and there is a drawback such<br>
that the mechanical strength tends to deteriorate due to<br>
progress in micro cracks and apertures. Since aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate also has the same drawback, the<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product is also<br>
insufficient in mechanical strength. Specifically, in a<br>
case where the aluminum magnesium titanate sintered<br>
product is used in an application in which high<br>
temperatures and heavy loads are applied, it cannot<br>
exhibit sufficient durability.<br>
Further, the lower limit of the temperature for<br>
synthesizing aluminum titanate is 1,280°C, while the<br>
lower limit of the temperature for synthesizing magnesium<br>
titanate is 900°C. Both are unstable in the temperature<br><br>
range lower than the temperatures for their syntheses.<br>
As a solid solution of these compounds, aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate is also unstable at a temperature<br>
lower than the temperature range for its synthesis like<br>
aluminum titanate and magnesium titanate. Accordingly,<br>
if aluminum magnesium titanate is used in a decomposing<br>
temperature range for long time, it is likely to undergo<br>
thermal decomposition to form TiO2 (rutile) and MgAl2O4<br>
(spinel). Here, the decomposing temperature range for<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate varies depending on a solid<br>
solution ratio of aluminum titanate and magnesium<br>
titanate, but it is usually from about 800 to 1,280°C.<br>
For example, in the case of an aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate sintered product, in which aluminum titanate and<br>
magnesium titanate are solid-solubilized in an<br>
approximately equivalent molar ratio, the aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate sintered product thermally decomposes<br>
into TiO2 (rutile) and MgAl2O4 (spinel) (Non-Patent<br>
Document 1) if it is continuously used at a temperature<br>
in the vicinity of 1,100°C for long time.<br>
Therefore, a conventional aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
sintered product could not be used continuously in such a<br>
decomposing temperature range, and regardless of its high<br>
heat resistance, extremely small thermal expansion<br>
coefficient and excellent corrosion resistance, the use<br>
of the conventional aluminum magnesium titanate was<br>
limited, because it had low reliability due to problems<br><br>
in the thermal decomposition property and mechanical<br>
strength.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
OBJECT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made on the basis of the<br>
above problems, and its object is to provide an aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal structure having high<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
As mentioned above, according to the present<br>
invention, a novel aluminum magnesium titanate crystal<br>
structure having high thermal decomposition resistance<br>
and high mechanical strength is provided, while<br>
maintaining its inherent high heat resistance, extremely-<br>
small thermal expansion coefficient and excellent thermal<br>
shock resistance. The reason as to why an aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal structure having such<br>
excellent properties is obtainable in accordance with the<br>
present invention is not clearly understood, but may<br>
probably be as follows.<br>
In the present invention, in a case where the above-<br>
mentioned silicon-containing compound having a specific<br>
melting point is doped with the mixture that forms<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate, the silicon-containing<br>
compound in a state of liquid phase melts at a<br>
temperature of from 700 to 1,500°C, and the formation of<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate i.e. the reaction of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate formation takes place in a liquid<br>
phase, whereby dense crystals will be formed thereby<br>
improving its mechanical strength. Further, the Si<br>
component contained in the silicon-containing compound,<br>
is substituted for some Al atoms in the crystal lattice<br>
of aluminum magnesium titanate for solid-solubilization.<br>
However, it will be solid-solubilized preferentially in<br>
the aluminum titanate crystal system rather than in the<br>
magnesium titanate crystal system. The reason for this<br><br>
is such that the strain of the octahedron constituting<br>
the crystal structure of aluminum titanate is large among<br>
pseudobrookite crystal structures, and the<br>
crystallographic anisotropy is remarkable, whereby the<br>
crystal structure is unstable as compared with magnesium<br>
titanate.<br>
Namely, Si is solid-solubilized preferentially in<br>
the crystal lattice of aluminum titanate and mainly<br>
occupies Al sites. At that time, rather than occupying<br>
alone the Al sites where a fundamentally trivalent<br>
electrical charge balance is maintained, tetravalent Si<br>
will form a pair with bivalent Mg in the system so that<br>
the pair of Si and Mg will be sexivalent in total and<br>
will be substituted for adjacent two Al (sexivalent in<br>
total). Thus, it is considered that by the simultaneous<br>
presence of Si and Mg, diffusion of ions among the<br>
respective cations can be suppressed even at high<br>
temperatures, and a stable crystal structure can be<br>
secured, whereby further improved thermal decomposition<br>
resistance can be obtained.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The aluminum magnesium titanate crystal structure of<br>
the present invention is a solid solution wherein at<br>
least some Al atoms in the surface layer of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal represented by the empirical<br>
formula MgxAl2(1-X)Ti(1+X)O5 are substituted with Si atoms.<br><br>
In the present invention, at least Al atoms present in<br>
the surface layer of aluminum magnesium titanate crystal<br>
may be substituted with Si atoms, and of course, Al atoms<br>
in the interior (deep layer) of aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate may also be substituted with Si atoms. The<br>
substitution with Si atoms is preferably as much as<br>
possible within the range of the solid solubility limit.<br>
Further, the value x is 0.1<x and particularly></x>
preferably 0.25&gt;x
titanate crystal is preferably a solid solution in which<br>
0.1 to 1 mol%, particularly preferably 0.2 to 0.7 mol%,<br>
most preferably 0.25 to 0.45 mol% of Al atoms, are<br>
substituted with Si atoms. In a case where this<br>
substitution ratio is less than 0.1 mol%, stabilization<br>
of crystals by solid-solubilization of Si atoms will be<br>
insufficient, whereby high thermal decomposition<br>
resistance will not be obtained. On the other hand, in a<br>
case where this substitution ratio is more than 1 mol%,<br>
it exceeds the solid solubility limit to a crystal of Si<br>
atoms, whereby precipitation of an impurity phase will be<br>
triggered, and such a substitution ratio does not<br>
contribute to suppression of thermal decomposition and<br>
causes an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient.<br>
The crystal structure of the present invention, which<br>
is a solid solution substituted with Si atoms, has an<br>
extremely small thermal expansion coefficient of from<br>
-6x10-6(l/K) to 6x10-6(l/K) and further from -3x10-6(l/K)<br><br>
to 3xl0-6(l/K), when heated in a range of from 50 to 800°C<br>
at a temperature raising rate of 20°C/min. As a result,<br>
the heat shock resistance of the crystal structure is<br>
extremely high and excellent.<br>
Further, a characteristic of the aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate crystal structure of the present invention<br>
resides in high thermal decomposition resistance such<br>
that the aluminum magnesium titanate crystal structure<br>
can be used continuously and stably at high temperatures.<br>
Such a thermal decomposition resistance is higher when<br>
the remaining ratio of aluminum magnesium titanate held<br>
in a high temperature atmosphere of 1,100°C for 3 00 hours<br>
is at least 50%, higher when the remaining ratio is at<br>
least 75%, and highest when the remaining ratio is at<br>
least 90%. This is in contrast with Comparative Example<br>
given hereinafter, wherein a conventional aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate shows a remaining ratio of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate as low as about 35%. Accordingly, the<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate crystal structure of the<br>
present invention can provide a reliable material, which<br>
can be used with stability for a long period of time at<br>
high temperatures including a decomposing temperature<br>
range of from 800 to 1,280°C as described above.<br>
Furthermore, a characteristic of the aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal structure of the present<br>
invention resides in its mechanical strength. That is,<br>
on the basis of the measurement of a three-point bending<br><br>
strength in accordance with JIS R16 01, the aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate crystal structure has a three-point<br>
bending strength of at least 25 MPa, preferably at least<br>
30 MPa and most preferably at least 40 MPa. This is in<br>
contrast with Comparative Example given hereinafter,<br>
wherein a conventional aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
crystal structure has a three-point bending strength as<br>
low as about 10 MPa. Accordingly, the aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate crystal structure of the present invention can<br>
provide a material which is useful in a field where a<br>
high mechanical strength is required and the conventional<br>
aluminum magnesium titanate cannot be used.<br>
The aluminum magnesium titanate crystal structure of<br>
the present invention is produced by firing at a<br>
temperature of from 1,200 to 1,700°C a raw material<br>
mixture having 1 to 10 parts by mass of a silicon-<br>
containing compound having a melting point of from 700 to<br>
1,500°C, mixed to 100 parts by mass of a mixture<br>
comprising a Mg-containing compound, Al-containing<br>
compound and Ti-containing compound in the same ratio as<br>
the metal component ratio of Mg, Al and Ti in aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate represented by the empirical formula<br>
MgxAl2(1-X)Ti(1+X)O5 (wherein 0.1<x as calculated the></x>
respective oxides.<br>
The above Mg-containing compound, Al-containing<br>
compound and Ti-containing compound to be used, are not<br>
particularly limited so long as they are components<br><br>
capable of synthesizing aluminum magnesium titanate by<br>
firing. The Mg-containing compound, Al-containing<br>
compound and Ti-containing compound may not necessarily<br>
be separate compounds respectively, and may be a compound<br>
containing two or more metal components. Such compounds<br>
may usually be suitably selected among those to be used<br>
as starting materials for various ceramics, such as<br>
alumina ceramics, titania ceramics, magnesia ceramics,<br>
aluminum titanate ceramics, magnesium titanate ceramics,<br>
spinel ceramics and aluminum magnesium titanate ceramics.<br>
Specific examples of such compounds include oxides such<br>
as Al2O3, TiO2 and MgO, composite oxides containing at<br>
least two types of metal components, such as MgAl2O4,<br>
Al2TiO5, and various spinel structures containing Mg and<br>
Ti, compounds containing one or more metal components<br>
selected from the group consisting of Al, Ti and Mg (such<br>
as carbonates, nitrates or sulfates).<br>
The blend ratio of the Mg-containing compound, Al-<br>
containing compound and Ti-containing compound is such<br>
that the ratio of the metal components contained in these<br>
compounds would be a ratio similar to, preferably<br>
substantially the same ratio as, the metal component<br>
ratio of Mg, Al and Ti in aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
represented by the above empirical formula<br>
MgxAl2(1-X)Ti(1+X)O5 . By using the above respective<br>
compounds as mixed in such a ratio, it is possible to<br>
obtain aluminum magnesium titanate having the same metal<br><br>
component ratio as the metal component ratio in the<br>
mixture used as the starting material.<br>
When the aluminum magnesium titanate crystal<br>
structure of the present invention is to be formed, a<br>
silicon-containing compound having a melting point of<br>
from 700 to 1,500°C is mixed to the mixture comprising<br>
the Mg-containing compound, Al-containing compound and<br>
Ti-containing compound. In such a case, the melting<br>
point of the silicon-containing compound to be used is<br>
important. If the melting point is less than 700°C, the<br>
additive will melt before the presintering, whereby no<br>
crystal structure having a sufficient strength will be<br>
formed in the molded product. Whereas, if the melting<br>
point is higher than 1,500°C, melting of the additive<br>
takes place after the reaction for forming aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate, the reaction for forming aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate cannot be carried out in a liquid<br>
phase, whereby solid-solubilization of Si atoms becomes<br>
difficult, and therefore, the object of the present<br>
invention cannot be accomplished. For example, in a case<br>
where SiO2 having the melting point of l,723°C was<br>
employed, no Si atom was confirmed in the interior of the<br>
crystal structure to be obtained, and it was rather<br>
separately deposited in the vicinity of crystal grains in<br>
the form of SiO2. The melting point of the silicon-<br>
containing compound is preferably from 900 to 1,300°C and<br>
particularly preferably from 1,000 to 1,200°C.<br><br>
As the above silicon-containing compound, an<br>
aluminosilicate is preferred. As the aluminosilicate, a<br>
natural mineral or a synthesized compound may be employed,<br>
but an aluminosilicate mineral is particularly preferred<br>
in view of its availability and cost. The<br>
aluminosilicate mineral may, for example, be plagioclase,<br>
feldspathoid, alkali feldspar, mica clay mineral, zeolite<br>
or cordierite. Among them, alkali feldspar, plagioclase<br>
or feldspathoid is particularly effective for enhanced<br>
sintering of aluminum magnesium titanate because of its<br>
low melting point.<br>
The amount of the silicon-containing compound to be<br>
used, is preferably from 1 to 10 parts by mass, more<br>
preferably from 3 to 5 parts by mass, per 100 parts by<br>
mass of the total amount, as calculated as oxides, of the<br>
Mg-containing compound, Al-containing compound and Ti-<br>
containing compound, even though it depends on the ratio<br>
of Al atoms in aluminum magnesium titanate crystal to be<br>
substituted with Si atoms. In such a case, the total<br>
amount of the mixture as calculated as oxides, is the<br>
weight after carrying out heat treatment to remove<br>
moisture or organic substances contained in the above<br>
mixture, or when presintering is carried out, the weight<br>
before the main firing after the presintering.<br>
In the present invention, to the raw material mixture<br>
comprising the Mg-containing compound, Al-containing<br>
compound, Ti-containing compound and silicon-containing<br><br>
compound, other additives may be added, as the case<br>
requires, whereby the nature of the crystal structure<br>
thereby obtainable, can be improved. As such other<br>
additives, oxides such as SiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3, MgO, A12O3,<br>
TiO2, CaO and Y2O3, or oxides having a spinel structure<br>
containing Mg, may, for example, be mentioned. At least<br>
one of these additives may be added preferably in an<br>
amount of at most 15 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass<br>
of the above mixture.<br>
The raw material mixture comprising the Mg-containing<br>
compound, Al-containing compound, Ti-containing compound<br>
and silicon-containing compound is thoroughly mixed and<br>
pulverized. The mixing and pulverization of the raw<br>
material mixture are not particularly limited and can be<br>
carried out by known methods. For example, they may be<br>
carried out by means of a ball mill, a medium-stirring<br>
mill, etc. The pulverization degree of the above raw<br>
material mixture is not particularly limited, but the<br>
average particle size is preferably at most 30 µm,<br>
particularly preferably from 8 to 15 µm. The smaller the<br>
average particle size, the better, so long as it is<br>
within a range where no secondary particles will be<br>
formed.<br>
The above mixture can be fired as it is, but<br>
preferably the mixture is preliminarily molded into a<br>
final form to be used and then fired. At the time of<br>
molding, molding assistants may preferably be<br><br>
incorporated to the above mixture. As such molding<br>
assistants, known agents such as a binder, a release<br>
agent, a defoaming agent and a peptizer may be employed.<br>
As the binder, polyvinyl alcohol, microwax emulsion,<br>
methylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose may, for<br>
example, be preferred. As the release agent, a stearic<br>
acid emulsion may, for example, be preferred; as the<br>
defoaming agent, n-octyl alcohol or octylphenoxyethanol<br>
may, for example, be preferred; and as the peptizer,<br>
diethylamine or triethylamine may, for example, be<br>
preferred.<br>
The amounts of the molding assistants are not<br>
particularly limited. However, in the case of the<br>
present invention, they are preferably within the<br>
following ranges, respectively, as calculated as solid<br>
contents, per 100 parts by mass of the total content, as<br>
calculated as the respective oxides, of the Mg-containing<br>
compound, Al-containing compound and Ti-containing<br>
compound to be used as the starting materials. Namely,<br>
it is preferred to use the binder in an amount of from<br>
about 0.2 to 0.6 part by mass, the release agent in an<br>
amount of from about 0.2 to 0.7 part by mass, the<br>
defoaming agent in an amount of from about 0.5 to 1.5<br>
parts by mass, and the peptizer in an amount of from<br>
about 0.5 to 1.5 parts by mass. The raw material mixture<br>
having such molding assistants incorporated, is mixed,<br>
kneaded and molded. As a method for molding, press<br><br>
molding, sheet molding, cast molding, extrusion molding,<br>
injection molding or CIP molding may, for example, be<br>
employed.<br>
The molded product obtained is preferably dried and<br>
then fired at from 1,200 to 1,700°C, preferably from<br>
1,300 to 1,500°C. The firing atmosphere is not<br>
particularly limited and is preferably an oxygen-<br>
containing atmosphere such as air which is commonly<br>
employed. The firing time is not particularly limited so<br>
long as the firing can be done until the sintering<br>
proceeds sufficiently, and it is usually at a level of<br>
from 1 to 2 0 hours.<br>
Also with respect to the temperature raising rate or<br>
the temperature lowering rate at the time of the above<br>
firing, there is no particular restriction, and such<br>
conditions may be suitably set so that no cracks will be<br>
formed in the obtainable sintered product. For example,<br>
it is preferred to gradually raise the temperature<br>
without rapid rise of the temperature to sufficiently<br>
remove moisture and the molding assistants such as a<br>
binder, etc. contained in the above mixture. Further, if<br>
necessary, prior to heating at the above-mentioned firing<br>
temperature, presintering may be carried out preferably<br>
within a temperature range of from 700 to 1,0 0 0°C for<br>
from 10 to 3 0 hours under mild temperature rise, whereby<br>
the1 stress in the sintered product which causes cracking<br>
during the formation of aluminum magnesium titanate, can<br><br>
be relaxed, and formation of cracks in the sintered<br>
product can be suppressed to obtain a uniform sintered<br>
product.<br>
The sintered product thus obtainable has excellent<br>
heat resistance and a low thermal expansion coefficient<br>
and yet has a crystal structure stabilized, and will thus<br>
be a crystal structure having excellent thermal<br>
decomposition resistance and high mechanical strength.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples. However, it<br>
should be understood that the present invention is by no<br>
means thereby restricted.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 5<br>
To 100 parts by mass of a mixture comprising 26.7<br>
mass% (20 mol%) of easily sinterable α-alumina, 62.8<br>
mass% (60 mol%) of anatase-type titanium oxide and 10.5<br>
mass% (20 mol%) of periclase-type magnesium oxide present<br>
as a natural mineral, from 1 to 10 parts by mass of an<br>
alkali feldspar represented by the chemical formula<br>
(Na0.6K0.4) AlSi3O8 was added so as to have a solid solution<br>
ratio (substitution ratio) of Si atoms indicated in Table<br>
1, and then 0.25 part by mass of polyvinyl alcohol as a<br>
binder, 1 part by mass of diethylamine as a peptizer, and<br>
0.5 part by mass of polypropylene glycol as a defoaming<br>
agent, were further added and mixed for 3 hours in a ball<br><br>
mill and then dried in a dryer at 120°C for at least 12<br>
hours to obtain a raw material powder.<br>
The obtained raw material powder was pulverized to<br>
about 15 0 mesh and subjected to pressing under the<br>
molding pressure of 60 MPa to obtain a 100 mm x 100 mm x<br>
10 mm molded product.<br>
The molded product thus obtained was further<br>
subjected to firing in accordance with the following<br>
heating pattern, followed by letting it stand to cool, to<br>
obtain an aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product.<br>
(Heating Pattern)<br>
From room temperature to 14 0°C for 21 hours<br>
Maintained at 14 0°C for 14 hours<br>
From 140°C to 216°C for 21 hours<br>
From 216°C to 295°C for 16 hours<br>
From 295°C to 379°C for 46 hours<br>
From 379°C to 458°C for 20 hours<br>
From 4 5 8°C to 7 00°C for 28 hours<br>
Maintained at 7 00°C for 3 hours<br>
From 700°C to 1,000°C for 26 hours<br>

Maintained at 1,400°C for 4 hours<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
An aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product was<br>
obtained in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 5 except<br>
that the alkali feldspar was not added.<br>
The sintered products obtained in Examples 1 to 5 as<br><br>
the crystal structures were polished to prepare test<br>
specimens. Such specimens were subjected to observation<br>
under TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and to EDX<br>
elemental analysis, whereby the presence of solid-<br>
solubilized Si ions inside the crystal grains of Examples<br>
1 to 5 were confirmed. Then, the crystal structures of<br>
Examples 1 to 5 were further subjected to the 29Si<br>
spectrum analysis by means of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic<br>
Resonance), and as a result, Si atoms were found to be<br>
present in the crystal structures as having a<br>
coordination number of 6. This indicates that from the<br>
silicon-containing compound, in which Si atoms have a<br>
coordination number of 4, Al atoms (coordination number<br>
of 6) are substituted by the reaction in the liquid phase<br>
i.e. by solid-solubilization.<br>
Further, diffraction peaks of aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate crystal were examined from the results obtained<br>
by means of the XRD measurement of the sintered products<br>
of Examples 1 to 5 and the crystal structure of<br>
Comparative Example 1. The diffraction peaks derived<br>
from Examples 1 to 5 were shifted to low-angle side as<br>
compared with Comparative Example 1, and each shift was<br>
calculated so as to obtain the solid-solubility ratio<br>
(substitution ratio) of Si atoms in the crystal.<br>
Further, in accordance with JIS R1618, a test<br>
specimen of 5 mm x 5 mm x 20 mm was cut out from each of<br>
the sintered products of Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative<br><br>
Example 1 and subjected to surface polishing, and then<br>
the thermal expansion coefficient was calculated on the<br>
basis of the expansion in a lengthwise direction when<br>
heated in a range of from 50°C to 800°C at a temperature<br>
raising rate of 2 0°C/min. The results are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
Furthermore, a test specimen of 10 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm<br>
was cut out from each of the sintered products of<br>
Examples 1 to 5 and the crystal structure of Comparative<br>
Example 1 and held in the atmosphere of 1,100°C, and then<br>
the remaining ratio α (%) of aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
upon expiration of 3 00 hours was calculated. The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
The remaining ratio of the aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate was obtained by means of the XRD measurement in<br>
accordance with the following method.<br>
Firstly, when aluminum magnesium titanate undergoes<br>
thermal decomposition, TiO2 (rutile) and MgAl2O4 (spinel)<br>
will be formed. Accordingly, by using the integrated<br>
intensity (ITIO2(110)) of the diffraction peak at the (110)<br>
face of rutile and the integrated intensity (IMAT(023)) of<br>
the diffraction peak at the (023) face of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate, the intensity ratio R of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate to rutile was obtained by the<br>
following formula:<br>
R=IMAT(023) / ( IMAT(023) + (ITIO2(110))<br>
Further, also with respect to the sintered product<br><br>
before carrying out the thermal treatment at 1,100°C, the<br>
intensity ratio R0 of aluminum magnesium titanate to<br>
rutile was obtained in the same manner.<br>
Then, using R and R0 obtained as described above, the<br>
remaining ratio α (%) of aluminum magnesium titanate was<br>
obtained by the following formula:<br>
α=(R/R0) x 100<br>
Then, a test specimen of 3 mm x 4 mm x 40 mm was cut<br>
out from each of the sintered products of Examples 1 to 5<br>
and Comparative Example 1 and subjected to surface<br>
polishing and edge grinding (removal of sharp edges).<br>
The three-point bending strengths of such test specimens<br>
were measured in accordance with JIS R1601. The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
As is evident from Table 1, the solid solution<br>
wherein some Al atoms in aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
crystal are substituted with Si atoms, has a high<br>
remaining ratio of aluminum magnesium titanate crystal as<br>
compared with Comparative Example 1, while maintaining<br>
its low thermal expansion property. Further, the crystal<br>
structures in Examples 1 to 5 have excellent mechanical<br>
properties in comparison with Comparative Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLES 6 to 10<br>
To 100 parts by mass of a mixture comprising 26.7<br>
mass% (20 mol%) of easily sinterable α-alumina, 62.8<br>
mass% (60 mol%) of anatase-type titanium oxide and 10.5<br>
mass% (20 mol%) of periclase-type magnesium oxide present<br>
as a natural mineral, an aluminosilicate mineral having a<br>
melting point and a chemical formula shown in Table 2 was<br>
added so that it would be 1 part by mass as calculated as<br>
SiO2.<br>
Other than the above conditions, aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate sintered products were obtained in the same<br>
manner as in Examples 1 to 5. A test specimen was cut<br>
out from each of the obtained sintered products in the<br>
same manner as in Examples 1 to 5, and the thermal<br>
expansion coefficient, remaining ratio a (%) of aluminum<br>
magnesium titanate and three-point bending strength were<br>
measured. The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
As is evident from Table 3, the aluminum magnesium<br>
titanate crystal structures obtained in Examples 6 to 10,<br>
which were subjected to liquid-phase sintering by a Si-<br>
containing compound that melts at the temperature at<br>
which aluminum magnesium titanate crystal is formed, had<br>
low thermal expansion properties, high remaining ratio a<br>
(%) of aluminum magnesium titanate crystal and high<br>
mechanical strength, as compared with Comparative<br><br>
Example 1.<br>
