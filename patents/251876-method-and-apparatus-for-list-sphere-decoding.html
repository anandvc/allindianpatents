SPHERE DECODING APARATUS FOR MIMO CHANNEL<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]    The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/686,819 entitled "MIMO-Single Code Word Receivers with List Sphere Decoding" filed June 1, 2005, assigned to the assignee hereof, and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Reference to Co-Pending Applications for Patent<br>
[0002] The present Application for Patent is related to co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/022,347 entitled "Capacity based rank prediction for MEMO design," assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0003]    The present disclosure relates generally to communications, and, more specifically, to techniques for decoding codewords received over a communications channel.<br>
Background<br>
[0004]    In a wireless communication system, an RF modulated signal from a transmitter may reach a receiver via a number of propagation paths. The characteristics of the propagation paths typically vary over time due to a number of factors such as fading and multipath. To provide diversity against deleterious path effects and improve performance, multiple transmit and receive antennas may be used. If the propagation paths between the transmit and receive antennas are linearly independent (i.e., a transmission on one path is not a linear combination of the transmissions on the other paths), then the likelihood of correctly receiving a data transmission increases as the number of antennas increases. Generally, diversity increases and performance improves with more transmit and receive antennas.<br>
[0005]    A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system can employ multiple (NT) transmit antennas and multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas may<br><br>
WO 2006/130804	PCT/US2006/021379<br>
be decomposed into Ns independent channels, with Ns<min nr each of the ns independent channels corresponds to a dimension and may also be referred as spatial subchannel transmission channel mimo channel. system can provide improved performance increased capacity if additional dimensionalities created by multiple transmit receive antennas are utilized.></min>
[0006]    For a full-rank MTMO channel, where NS=NT<nr an independent data stream may be transmitted from each of the nt transmit antennas. streams experience different channel conditions fading and multipath effects achieve signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios for a given amount power. moreover if successive interference cancellation is used at receiver to recover then snrs achieved depending on specific order in which are recovered. consequently support unique rate. since typically vary with time rate supported by also time.></nr>
[0007]    A MIMO design can have multiple modes of operation. In one mode of operation, the transmitter can encode the data transmitted on each spatial layer independently, possibly with different rates. The receiver can employ an SIC algorithm that works as follows: Decode the first layer, and then subtract its contribution from the received signal after re-encoding and multiplying the encoded first layer with an "estimated channel," then decode the second layer, and so on. This approach means that each successively decoded layer sees increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence can support higher rates. In the absence of error propagation, this mode of operation combined with SIC achieves capacity. The disadvantages of this design arise from the burden of "managing" the rates of each spatial layer, in particular (a) increased CQI (channel quality indicator) feedback signaling overhead (one CQI for each layer); (b) increased ACK/NACK messaging (one message for each layer); (c) complications with the Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) scheme, since each layer can terminate at a different transmission; (d) performance sensitivity to channel estimation errors in channels experiencing increased Doppler effect and/or low SNR; and (e) tighter decoding latency requirements since each successive layer cannot be decoded until the prior layers are decoded. In other modes, a common encoding of a single data stream from a single antenna is provided. Alternatively, a transmitter may encode the data on each spatial<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
layer using the same data rate for each layer, and rank prediction may be employed to adapt the number of spatial layers on a packet-by-packet basis depending on the channel conditions and the SNR.<br>
[0008]    To decode the received codewords, a receiver can employ a low complexity linear receiver such as an MMSE (minimum mean squared error) equalizer for each tone. Alternatively, non-linear receivers such as an ML (maximum likelihood) MIMO decoder can be used to achieve better performance at the cost of a more complex implementation. In particular, the complexity of an ML MIMO decoder is exponential with the rank M and the symbol constellation order Mc. For an overview of prior art decoders for MIMO, see Hochwald and Brink, "Achieving Near-Capacity on a Multiple-Antenna Channel," IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 51, No.3, March 2003, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]    FIG. 1 shows a wireless communication system 1 with multiple access points (APs) 10 and multiple terminals 20. A base station is a station that communicates with the terminals. A base station may also be called, and may contain some or all of the functionality of, an access point, a Node B, and/or some other network entity. Each access point 10 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area 2. The term "cell" can refer to an access point and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. To improve system capacity, an access terminal coverage area may be partitioned into multiple smaller areas, e.g., three smaller areas 4a, 4b, and 4c. Each smaller area is served by a respective base transceiver subsystem (BTS). The term "sector" can refer to an AP and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the APs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the base station for the cell. The signaling transmission techniques described herein may be used for a system with sectorized cells as well as a system with un-sectorized cells. For simplicity, in the following description, the term "base station" is used generically for a station that serves a sector as well as a station that serves a cell.<br>
[0024]    Terminals 20 are typically dispersed throughout the system, and each terminal may be fixed or mobile. A terminal may also be called, and may contain some or all of the functionality of, a mobile station, a user equipment, and/or some other device. A terminal may be a wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem card, and so on. A terminal may communicate with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the forward and reverse links at any given moment.<br>
[0025]    For a centralized architecture, a system controller 30 couples to APs 10 and provides coordination and control for these base stations. System controller 30 may be<br><br>
WO 2006/130804	PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
a single network entity or a collection of network entities. For a distributed architecture, the APs may communicate with one another as needed.<br>
[0026]    FIG. 2 shows an SCW transmitter with rank prediction. The bits 202 are turbo-encoded 204 and QAM mapped 206 depending on the packet format (PF) 208, 210, specified by a rate prediction algorithm 212. In an embodiment, the coded symbols are then de-multiplexed 214 to M streams 216 or layers, where M 228 can be a 2-bit integer specified by the receiver 226 feedback every 5 m-sec, in addition to a 5-bit CQI 224. The M streams 216 are then spatially mapped 218 to MT OFDM modulators 220 and MT antennas 222.<br>
[0027]    FIG. 3 shows an SCW receiver 201 employing either a linear MMSE equalizer or some type of decoder 234. In this embodiment, MR antennas 232 receive a signal transmitted over the air. The output of each antenna 232 is OFDM demodulated 233 and input to a linear MMSE equalizer or decoder 234.  The linear MMSE equalizer or decoder 234 can each be implemented on a tone-by-tone basis, i.e., for each tone, MR received signals are processed to generate M symbols 236. The linear MMSE equalizer or decoder 234 can also generate information to allow CQI and rank computation 231. The symbols 236 are demultiplexed 235, and a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) 237 can be calculated for each of the M symbols 236. The LLR's 237 may then be supplied to a turbo decoder 238 which outputs decoded bits 239.<br>
[0028]    Various decoder implementations for an SCW receiver will now be described herein, in particular-, an ML MEMO decoder, a sphere decoder, a list sphere decoder, and a list sphere trellis decoder. <br>
[0029]    To understand the operation of the ML MTMO decoder, define the following:<br>
M R :	Number of Receive Antennas<br>
M :	Rank of MIMO Transmission<br>
H :	MEMO channel per tone (M R x M)<br>
x:	Received signal vector per tone (M R x 1)<br>
S :	Transmit symbol vector per tone (M xl) = [s1   s2   ..   ..   sM ]<br>
n:	Noise Vector per tone (M R x 1)<br>
[0030]    The system equation for a given tone is given as:<br>
x = Hs + n	(Eq. 1)<br>
[0031]    The ML MIMO solution is given as:<br>
sML=arg min\\x-Hs\\2	(Eq. 2)<br>
seA.<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
[0032]    where A is the lattice defined by having each entry of the M-dimensional vector s be taken from a constellation of 2Mc points. It can be seen that the ML MEMO decoder selects the transmit symbol vector sML that maximizes the likelihood of the received signal vector being x. In some aspects, the complexity of the ML MTMO decoder is exponential with the number of MIMO layers M and the symbol constellation order Mc.<br>
[0033]    To reduce the exponential complexity of ML MIMO decoding, a technique known as sphere decoding may be employed. To understand sphere decoding, first define the QR decomposition of the channel matrix H:  H =QR, where Q is an<br>
MRxM unitary matrix (herein defined as any matrix Q such that Q*Q = I), and R is an upper triangular MxM matrix. Also define s to be the zero-forcing solution<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0034]    According to Eq. 3, the sphere decoder can restrict its search for a sphere decoder solution sSD to those hypotheses s located inside a sphere of radius "r" centered<br>
about the zero-forcing solution s. The sphere decoder thus avoids an exhaustive ML search over all possible hypotheses s.<br>
[0035]    Using the QR decomposition, the expression in Eq. 3 can be further manipulated as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 [0036]    The form of Eq. 4 takes advantage of the fact that R is triangular to conveniently divide the computation of the term to be minimized among the separate layers i. Note that the same will also be true for any lower triangular decomposition of the matrix H. This form suggests a sphere decoding procedure for decoding a received codeword as described below.<br>
[0037]    A possible implementation of a sphere decoding procedure is shown in the flow chart diagram of FIG. 4. Note the flow chart diagrams given in this disclosure are<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br>
only meant to be illustrative of possible implementations, and should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. First, an initial value for the sphere radius r is determined, block 301. Next, set i = M for the Mth layer computation, block 302. From a computational viewpoint, the LHS (left-hand side) of Eq. 4 may become <br>
                                                        the constellation used for M* layer. Next, a search over all candidate constellation points is performed to select a candidate constellation point, block 304. In some cases, the constellation point, sM, is selected such that<br>
                                       The candidate constellation point IM is saved, e.g. in memory, block 305.<br>
[0038]	The layer being operated on is then decremented, e.g. i = M -1, as<br>
shown in block 306. From a computational viewpoint, the LHS of Eq. 4 now becomes<br><br><br><br>
the constellation used for the (M-l)th layer. For SCW design, the constellation used for all layers is the same, i.e., Am = A, Vm = 1,2,...M    For a given point sM, select one<br>
constellation point, IM-1 such that<br><br><br>
 [0039]    If no point ~sM_1 is available for the choice of JM , then the process reverts back<br>
to selecting another constellation point IM, as shown in blocks 309 and 310.<br>
[0040]	For a given pair fM_t, IM, set i = M - 2 , and the operations 304-306 may<br>
be repeated. This process of determining candidate points is continued for all<br>
subsequent layers up to and including i = 1, at which point a series of candidate points<br>
[ $M ยป *M-I &gt; SM~2 'โขโขโขโข' *i ] corresponding to a single candidate solution vector scmd is<br>
obtained. This may be accomplished by the decrement block 306 and the loop-back to<br>
block 303. In the case where i = 0, the vector sccmd is saved, as shown in block 307.<br>
[0041]	A new update to the radius rupdale may then be calculated and the radius<br>
changed to r 
 <br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br>
[0042]    The process may be repeated with this new radius rupdate, and the procedure is continued until there is no candidate solution vector falling within a radius rupdate- Note that the sphere radius shrinks with each iteration, and hence in general the decoder does not need to evaluate all possible candidate points to obtain the sphere decoder solution<br>
SSD-<br>
[0043]    From the description above, it will be noted that the complexity of the sphere decoder grows with increasing sphere radius "r", and eventually approaches ML complexity. On the other hand, if the radius "r" is selected too small, then the ML solution can potentially lie outside the sphere, leading to incorrect solutions. In general, the preferred sphere radius "r" grows with (a) large eigenvalue spread of the MIMO channel and (b) low SNR. Also, as no soft information is generated by the sphere decoder for alternative codewords, it cannot provide a turbo decoder with soft information for joint decoding.<br>
[0044]    The list sphere decoder is a MIMO-MAP decoder that, is capable of generating soft-information for use by a turbo decoder, and is based on sphere decoder principles. A possible algorithmic implementation of the list sphere decoder is shown in FIG. 5, to which reference will be made in the description below.<br>
[0045]    As shown in block 401 of FIG. 5, first select a sphere radius "r," as well as a parameter Ncand whose function will later be described. Then follow blocks 402-406, analogous to blocks 302-306 of FIG. 4, to arrive at a candidate solution vector Scand<br>
comprising candidate points                                           Once a candidate solution vector is obtained, an associated cost                               can be computed as shown in 407, and<br><br>
can be utilized by an outer turbo-decoder to improve performance. The cost for a candidate solution vector can be referred to as an "overall" cost metric, as distinguished from a per-layer cost metric such as computed according to the LHS of Eq. 4. Note that the noise variance a2 can in general be different for different tones. The candidate solution vector-cost association can be entered and stored in a "candidate list" as shown in 409. These steps are repeated for other candidate solutions within the sphere radius "r" until Ncmd candidate solutions reside in the candidate list. The parameter Ncand may also be referred to as a "candidate plurality." Thereafter, an additional candidate solution vector is added to the candidate list only if its associated cost is less than the highest cost already on the candidate list. If this is the case, the candidate solution<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
vector cost entry having the highest cost is deleted, thereby maintaining a total of no more than Ncand entries in the candidate list at any time. Alternatively, the first Ncand<br>
costs computed by the decoder for a received codeword can be defined to qualify as one of the NCand lowest costs on the candidate list, and thus a general check can be performed as shown in block 408.<br>
[0046]    In contrast with the sphere decoder, the list sphere decoder is capable of providing soft information for several candidate codewords, as well as soft information for each bit (or symbol) of each candidate codeword. Thus, it may be used in conjunction with other decoders utilizing a priori soft information, such as a turbo decoder. To see this, let Mcbe the modulation order and let M be the rank of the<br>
MIMO transmission, resulting in a total of MMc bits transmitted per tone. In a preferred embodiment, the soft extrinsic information (LLR) for each bit bk    V k = 1,2..MMc can be approximated as:<br><br><br><br>
where<br><br>
includes all the candidate solution vectors with bk = 1; a2 is the noise-variance;<br><br>
                                                                   is a sub-vector of bits obtained by excluding bk;<br>
                                                                     vector of a-priori LLR information on all<br>
corresponding bits present in the vector bm; and<br>
max* (a,b) = ln(ea +eb).<br>
[0047]    From the description of the list sphere decoder given above, the sphere radius "r" does NOT decrease with each iteration. As a result, the complexity increases greatly if the initial sphere radius is selected too large. Furthermore, both the quality of the computed LLR and the complexity increase with increasing values of Ncand. Eq. 5 is an<br><br>

equality if Ncand = 2MMยฐ. In general, the performance and complexity of the above algorithm depend on "r" and Ncand.<br>
[0048]    FIG. 7 shows a trellis diagram for list sphere trellis decoding. The diagram has M stages corresponding to the rank of the MIMO transmission and 2Mc states corresponding to the number of constellation points. For example, for a 16-QAM constellation and Rank 4 transmission, we have M=4 and Mc=4. <br>
[0049]    Similar to list sphere decoding, a parameter Ncand may be specified, corresponding to the maximum number of entries maintained in the candidate list for each stage. In the example trellis shown in FIG. 7, Ncmd = 2. A possible algorithmic<br>
implementation of the general list sphere decoding algorithm is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
[0050]	In Fig. 6. first, an initialization of Ncand is providedand set i = M, blocks<br>
501-502 of FIG. 6. A cost function R2MM ||sM -sM ||2 is computed for all constellation point, block 503. In some aspects, only e Ncand points that have the minimum cost are preserved. If Ncand &gt; 2Mc, then preserve only the 2Mc points that have the minimum<br>
cost. In a trellis implementation of a decoder, e.g with reference to the trellis diagram of FIG. 7, these states are denoted by the shaded circles. These states can also be referred to as the "preferred" states.<br>
[0051]    For each of the preferred states selected i, a cost metric associated with each transition from a preferred state of the Mth layer to one of the 2Mc candidate constellation points for the (M-l)th layer is computed, block 505. An individual cost metric can be computed as:<br><br><br>
 [0052]    This creates a total of Ncand2Mc candidate pairs [sM, sM_{ ], each with an<br>
associated cost metric. The pairs are indicated by the "dotted lines" in FIG. 7, for a<br>
trellis implementation<br>
[0053]   From a mathematical standpoint, it may be observed that the term<br>
                                                 6 is essentially computed already been computed earlier in<br><br>
block 503 of FIG . 6, and thus need not be re-computed when performing later<br>
computations, e.g. in block 505. Further, the same observation applies to the cost<br>
metric computations at subsequent stages i, i.e., the state cost metric computed for the<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br>
(i+l)th stage can be stored and re-used during computation of a state cost metric for the ith stage, or layer, of the trellis. Similarly,                                   need only be computed<br>
Ncmd times initially, and can also be stored and re-used for the rest of the Ncand2Mc<br>
computations. The same observation applies with respect to the computation of metrics for the subsequent stages i.<br>
[0054]    Then, from the Ncand2Mc pairs or "dotted paths" shown in FIG. 7, save to memory only the Ncand preferred transitions from layer M to layer M-l having the<br>
minimum cost, block 506. Also save to memory the constellation points and costs associated with those preferred transitions. The pairs having minimum cost are denoted by the solid lines in FIG. 8. These paths and costs are stored along with the stored paths and costs from the previous layer to create a record of the trellis path traversed. These paths can also be referred to as the "preferred" transitions.<br>
[0055]     As illustrated by the loop back to the decrement block 504 in FIG. 5, blocks 505-507 are analogously performed for each subsequent layer up to layer 1. As previously described, only the Ncmd preferred transitions and associated constellation<br>
points / costs need be saved in memory for each layer.<br>
[0056]    Once the layer 1 computations are finished, the final trellis diagram of FIG. 9<br>
is obtained showing Ncand paths and candidate solution vectors. Eq. 5 can subsequently<br>
be used to obtain the LLR for each bit.<br>
[0057]    As further refinements to the list sphere decoding algorithms, the optimization parameter Ncand can be varied depending on the constellation size, as well as across stages, depending on channel conditions for each tone or group of tones, or other factors. In an embodiment, Ncand may be dynamically adjusted to be greater in the presence of worse channel conditions, and lower in the presence of better channel conditions.<br>
[0058]    Note that in some aspects, the term La[y calculated in Eq. 5 can be omitted if unavailable, for example, if turbo-decoder iterations have yet to be performed, or if the turbo decoding is altogether decoupled from the list sphere decoding. In certain aspects, a list sphere decoder may be concatenated with a turbo decoder, and soft information calculated by the list sphere decoder may be iteratively exchanged with the turbo decoder, and vice versa, until a convergent solution is obtained.<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
[0059]    Note also that, in general, the decoding procedure described herein may also be implemented using alternative criteria to identify preferred states of each layer. For example, instead of preserving only the Ncand states or transitions having the lowest computed cost metrics, an implementation may preserve those states or transitions whose cost metrics meet certain other criteria, such as being below a preferred cost value. Such alternative criteria also fall within the scope of the present disclosure. [0060]    It should be noted, that the above procedures may easily be applied to multi-codeword (MCW) systems, wherein the constellation sizes vary across each stage. In an embodiment, Ncand can be set a constant 256 across all stages to give acceptable performance for an SCW 4x4 MIMO system.<br>
[0061]    Further, while FIGS. 6-9 are generally discussed in the context of utilizing a trellis diagram, the above methodologies may be utilized without usage of a trellis methodology. For example, the cost metrics may calculated for each layer and constellation point for the layer, without using trellis diagram representation. In such a case, the above calculations may be made for MIMO layers, instead of trellis stages, and constellation point, instead of states of the trellis stages.<br>
[0062]    FIG. 10 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of an AP lOx and two ATs 20x and 20y in multiple-access multi-carrier communication system 100. At AP lOx, a transmit (TX) data processor 514 receives traffic data (i.e., information bits) from a data source 512 and signaling and other information from a controller 520 and a scheduler 530. For example, controller 520 may provide power control (PC) commands that are used to adjust the transmit power of the active ATs, and scheduler 530 may provide assignments of carriers for the ATs. These various types of data may be sent on different transport channels. TX data processor 514 encodes and modulates the received data using multi-carrier modulation (e.g., OFDM) to provide modulated data (e.g., OFDM symbols). A transmitter unit (TMTR) 516 then processes the modulated data to generate a downlink modulated signal that is then transmitted from an antenna 518. [0063]    At each of ATs 20x and 20y, the transmitted and modulated signal is received by an antenna 552 and provided to a receiver unit (RCVR) 554. Receiver unit 554 processes and digitizes the received signal to provide samples. A received (RX) data processor 556 then demodulates and decodes the samples to provide decoded data, which may include recovered traffic data, messages, signaling, and so on. The traffic data may be provided to a data sink 558, and the carrier assignment and PC commands sent for the terminal are provided to a controller 560.<br><br>
WO 2006/130804		PCT/US2006/021379<br><br>
[0064]    Controller 560 directs data transmission on the uplink using the resources that have been assigned to the terminal and indicated in the received assignment. Controller 560 further injects the erasure signature packets when the there is not actual data to transmit, yet desires to keep the assigned resources.<br>
[0065]    Controller 520 directs data transmission on the downlink using the resources that have been assigned to the terminal. Controller 520 further injects the erasure signature packets when the there is not actual data to transmit, yet desires to keep the assigned resources.<br>
[0066]    For each active terminal 120, a TX data processor 574 receives traffic data from a data source 572 and signaling and other information from controller 560. For example, controller 560 may provide information indicative of channel quality information, required transmit power, the maximum transmit power, or the difference between the maximum and required transmit powers for the terminal. The various types of data are coded and modulated by TX data processor 574 using the assigned carriers and further processed by a transmitter unit 576 to generate an uplink modulated signal that is then transmitted from antenna 552.<br>
[0067]    At AP 10x, the transmitted and modulated signals from the ATs are received by antenna 518, processed by a receiver unit 532, and demodulated and decoded by an RX data processor 534. Receiver unit 532 may estimate the received signal quality (e.g., the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) for each terminal and provide this information to controller 520. Controller 520 may then derive the PC commands for each terminal such that the received signal quality for the terminal is maintained within an acceptable range. RX data processor 534 provides the recovered feedback information (e.g., the required transmit power) for each terminal to controller 520 and scheduler 530. <br>
[0068]    Scheduler 530 may provide an indication to controller 520 to maintain the resources. This indication is provided if more data is scheduled to be transmitted. For the AT 20x, the controller 560 may determine if resources required to be maintained. In certain aspects, controller 520 may perform instructions that provide the functionality of scheduler 530.<br>
[0069]    Further, controller 560 may perform all or some of the functions discussed with respect to FIGS. 1-9 with respect to the access terminal.<br>
[0070]    The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units (e.g., controllers 520 and<br><br>

560, TX and RX processors 514 and 534, and so on) for these techniques may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0071]    For a software implementation, the techniques described herein may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that include the instructions that may be implemented by one or more processors to perform the functions described herein. The instructions may be stored in memory units, e.g., memory 522 in FIG. 10, on a removable media, or the like that may be read and executed by one or more processors (e.g., controllers 520).

ABSTRACT<br>
"SPHERE DECODING APPARATUS FOR MIMO CHANNEL"<br>
Method and apparatuses for decoding codewords over a MIMO channel are provided. According to one aspect of the disclosure, a cost function is computed for each constellation point of an Mth rankor spatial layer and Ncand of those constellation points having minimum cost are preserved as candidate points, where Ncand is a parameter specified to the decoding algorithm. In addition, a cost function may be computed for all possible transitions from the Ncand candidate points of the Mth rank to ail possible constellations points of the (M-l)th spatial layer, and AA of those transitions having minimum cost are preserved as candidate points. The process is repeated for all spatial layers, resulting in the identification of Ncand candidate codewords and their associated cost functions. The algorithm is derived from the list sphere decoding method.<br></td>
