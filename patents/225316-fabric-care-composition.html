3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification performed :	particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles comprising a lubricant, preferably a sugar polyester and their uses, such as delivery to fabric during laundering.  Laundry treatment compositions containing compositions according to the invention, provide softening benefits to fabric.  The invention further relates to a method of depositing a lubricant, preferably sugar polyester onto a substrate by means of such a composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, such as a fabric, is a well known method of imparting desirable properties to the substrate.  In laundry applications the range of "benefit agents" is diverse and includes fabric softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, shape retention agents, anti-crease agents, ease of ironing aids, perfumes, lubricants, texturising agents, insecticide repellents, fungicides,, photofading inhibitors, fluorescers, sunscreens and many others.  Deposition of a benefit agent is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric conditioning to. confer, for example, softening benefit to the fabric.<br>
Conventionally, the deposition or tne Denefit agent has had to rely upon attractive forces between the oppositely charged substrate and the benefit agent.  For example,<br><br>
cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it.<br>
However, adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite charge to that of the benefit agent.  For example, cationic fabric conditioning agents are incompatible with anionic surfactants in laundry washing compositions, hence fabric conditioning products are usually separate from main wash products.  Furthermore, the substantivity of the benefit agent can be severely reduced and/or the deposition rate of the benefit agent can be reduced because of the<br>
4<br>
presence of incompatible charged species in the compositions.  The conventional way around this problem is to add benefit agents during the rinsing step of a treatment process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged chemical species present in the main wash compositions. This has clear cost disadvantages to the consumer and instigates the need for two separate products instead of one.<br>
However, in recent times, it has been	proposed to deliver a<br>
benefit agent in a form whereby it is	substituted onto<br>
another chemical moiety, which itself	has an affinity for<br>
the substrate in'question'.<br>
Compositions which are capable of imparting lubrication and/or softening to substrates such as fabric, hair and skin<br><br><br>
are well known in the art and as such, deposition systems which are capable of delivering a wide range of lubricants and softeners are widely sought after. For example, in the context of laundry products, a drive towards biodegradable lubricants promotes the need for new deposition systems.<br>
Prior Art<br>
WO 99/36469 is directed to a polysaccharide conjugate capable of binding cellulose. Locust bean gum (LBG) is grafted to proteins, such as enzymes or anti-bodies or perfume loaded particles. This is delivered to the fabric during the laundering. The LBG attachment is achieved by enzymatic oxidation of the LBG using galactose oxidase to introduce aldehyde groups. These aldehyde groups are then reacted with glucose oxidase (using sodium cyanoborohydride) to form an LBG with chemically bound glucose oxidase. This procedure for preparing the material is cumbersome and involves numerous steps using 'conventional' organic (enzymatic) chemistry, such as purification of LBG, introducing aldehyde functionality to the LBG and coupling of this to an enzyme (via the enzymes hydroxyl functionality).<br>
WO 99/36470 is also directed to polysaccharide conjugates that are able to bind cullulose, where the polysaccharide is attached to a particle containing perfume. The particle may be a range of materials, including silica. Perfume is allowed to infuse   into   macroporous   silica   particles   simply   by   absorption,   adsorption, impregnation and/or encapsulation. The polysaccharide, e.g. LBG, is then merely<br><br>
added to the perfumed particles and is physically adsorbed onto the particle surface.  The LBG aids deposition in a wash environment.<br>
European patent application number 01306632.9 is directed to a water dispersible particle comprising a deposition enhancing part of one or more polymeric units and a benefit agent attached to the deposition enhancing part.  Preferably the deposition aid has a hydrolysable group (based on esters), such as Cellulose Mono-Acetate (CMA).  The modified particles are prepared by reaction of acid functional beads by a cumbersome multi-step 'conventional' organic chemistry technique.  This requires several time consuming (and commercially nonviable for high volume production) centrifugation stages and the preparation of an amine functional CMA by reaction of CMA with ethylene diamine using carbonyl diimidazole as coupling agent.  The amine functional CMA is then reacted with acid functional beads (obtained externally) using ethyl dimethyl aminopropyl carbodimide as coupler.  This results in CMA grafted particles which exhibit enhanced wash deposition.<br>
Our GB patent application number 0229806.5 is directed towards a process for the preparation of polysaccharide grafted latex particles which comprises conventional emulsion polymerisation.and to the materials thus produced. The particles have been used as carriers for benefit agents, including softeners, for deposition under main wash conditions.  However, constraints on the amount of benefit agents which can be incorporated into the particles and the<br><br>
types of monomer units that can be used, which are inherent to conventional emulsion polymerisation, are inevitable.<br>
Co-pending patent application GB 0411995.4 is directed towards compositions comprising: a water-soluble or dispersible polysaccharide having a hydrophobic agent bonded thereto by a hydrolytically stable bond and a sugar polyester (SPE).<br>
Despite these advances, the need remains for deposition systems which are capable of delivering biodegradable benefit agents to a substrate.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that a polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle comprising a lubricant such as a sugar provides lubricating and softening benefits to fabric.  The lubricant can be incorporated into the particle in surprisingly high levels, which was not possible using techniques of preparation previously available.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
A first aspect of the invention provides a polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle wherein the polysaccharide has β-1,4 linkages wherein the polymer particle size is less than 1 micron and wherein the polymer particle comprises monomer units that contain at least one ethylenically unsaturated group capable of undergoing addition polymerisation and further comprises a.biodegradable lubricant, which is a sugar polyester.<br><br>
A second aspect of the invention provides a process for the preparation of the particles according to the first aspect.<br><br>
A third aspect of the invention provides a use of a polysaccharide-grafted polymer according to the first aspect, in the treatment of fabric, preferably cotton and further to provide a softening, lubricating, crease reduction, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour preservation and/or anti-pilling benefit to the fabric.<br>
The invention rurtner provides a laundry treatment composition comprising the polysaccharide-grafted particle of the first aspect and its uses in the treatment of fabric and in the provision of a softening, lubricating, crease reduction, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour preservation and/or anti-pilling benefit to the fabric.<br>
The invention further provides a method of treating fabric,<br>
*<br>
preferably cotton, comprising contacting the fabric with the grafted-polysaccharide polymer of the first aspect.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed towards polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles, such as latex particles, comprising a lubricant.<br>
The term "latex" or "latex particle" as used herein is defined as a stable colloidal dispersion of a polymeric substance in an aqueous medium.  The polymer particles are ■ usually approximately spherical and of typical colloidal dimensions.  Particle diameters may range from about 30 to 500 nm (The Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and<br><br>
Engineering, Second Edition, Volume 8, Page 647, John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1987)).<br>
The Monomers<br>
A wide range of monomers can be used in the process of the invention. By "monomer units" as used herein is meant the monomeric units of the polymer chain|, thus references to "a polymer particle comprising hydrophobic monomer units" as used herein means that the polymer particle is derived from hydrophobic monomers, and so forth.<br>
The monomer is a monomer suitable for free radical aqueous mini emulsion polymerisation.  Therefore, the monomer contains at least one ethylenically 'unsaturated group capable of undergoing addition polymerisation.<br>
A mixture of monomers may be used.  The monomers of the mixture may be selected according to| their solubilities. Preferably, the monomer mixture comprises monomers of low solubility and monomers of high solubility.<br>
By low solubility as used herein in reference to monomers, is meant that the material is soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration in the range of from 0.1 to 30 g/litre, at 25°C.<br>
By high solubility as used herein in reference to monomers,<br><br>
equivalent) at a concentration of greater than 30 g/litre, at 25°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, those monomers that are of low solubility preferably make up greater than 30 %, preferably 35 to 99 % of the mixture, by weight of the total monomer mixture, and those monomers of high solubility preferably make up less than 30 % of the mixture, by weight of the total monomer mixture.<br>
Examples of suitable monomers having low solubility as defined above include olefins, ethylene, vinylaromatic monomers such as styrene, α-methylstyrene, o- chlorostyrene or vinyltoluenes, esters of vinyl alcohol and monocarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl n-butyrate, vinyl laurate and vinyl stearate, esters of a, (S-monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids, such as acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric and itaconic acid, with alcohols,. such as methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, 2-ethylhexyl, octyl, decyl, lauryl," myristic, cetyl and stearyl alcohol, dimethyl or di-n-butyl maleate, nitriles of α β-monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylonitrile, and conjugated dienes, such as 1,3-butadiene and isoprene.  Preferred monomers include vinyl acetate, methacrylate and styrene.  Most preferred monomers include butyl acrylate.<br>
Examples of suitable monomers having high solubility as defined above are α  β-monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids and their amides, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br><br>
acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, poly (alkylene oxide) monoacrylates and monomethacrylates, vinyl-sulfonic acid and its water-soluble salts, and N-vinyl-pyrrolidone.  These monomers of low solubility may be used alone or in combination with other low soluble or high soluble monomers thus forming homopolymers or copolymers respectively.  The person skilled in the art will recognise which monomers may be used alone and which must be used in a mixture with other monomers to produce a latex particle.<br>
Monomers which internally crosslink the emulsion droplets may also be incorporated during the polymerisation.  Such crosslinkers may have at least two non-conjugated ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. ■ Examples are alkylene glycol diacrylates and dimethacrylates such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-propylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4-butylene glycol diacrylates and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, and also divinylbenzene, vinyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate, allyl rnethacrylate, allyl acrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, methylenebisacrylamide, cyclopentadienyl acrylate, and triallyl cyanurate.  A further type of suitable crosslinking monomers are those that are conjugated, such as divinyl benzene.  These monomers are copolymerised mostly in amounts of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers to be polymerised.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, insoluble (i.e. very hydrophobic) latex monomers (by "insoluble" is meant that the material is not soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration of 0.1 g/litre or above, at 25°C) are used.<br>
Particles of the invention can be derived from hydrophilic monomers, i.e. mcnomers of solubility of greater than about 30 g/litre, preferably greater than 35 g/litre, for example 40 to 45 g/litre in water (distilled or equivalent) at 25°C. Examples include but are not limited to methacrylic and acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylates and methacrylates, glycerol acrylates and methacrylates, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylates and acrylates, n-vinyl pyrrolidone, acryloyl morpholirie, n-vinyl acetamide, vinyl caprolactone.  Such monomers may be utilised in a monomer mixture at levels of up to 10 % based on particle weight.<br>
It is highly preferred if the monomers are selected such that the resulting polymer has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of less than room temperature, preferably of from minus 70 to minus 20 degrees C, more preferably of from minus 60  to minus 50 degrees C. A  highly preferred monomer is butyl acrylate, which gives a polymer with a Tg of minus 55 degrees C.  For the sake of clarity, it is the polymer without the lubricant.that preferably has a Tg of less than room temperature (the presence of a lubricant in the particle may alter the Tg of the polymer).  The Tg of polymers are typically measured using DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry).<br><br>
The monomer is mixed with a cosurfactant.  Suitable cosurfactants for use in the present invention include hexadecane, cetyl alcohol, lauroyl peroxide, n-dodecyl mercaptan, dodecyl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate.  The preferred cosurfactant comprises hexadecane.<br>
Initiators and chain transfer agents may also be  present. Those skilled in the art will recognise that a chemical initiator will generally be required but that there are instances in which alternative forms of initiation will be possible, e.g. ultrasonic initiation or initiation by irradiation.<br>
The initiator is preferably a chemical or chemicals capable of forming free radicals.  Typically, free radicals can be formed either by homolytic scission (i.e. homolysis) of a single bond or by single electron transfer to or from an ion or molecule (e.g. redox reactions).<br>
Suitably, in context of the invention, homolysis may be achieved by the application of heat (typically in the range of from 50 to 100°C).  Some examples of suitable initiators in this class are those possessing peroxide (-0-0-) or azo (-N=N-) grpup, such as benzoylperoxide, t-butyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile and ammonium persulphate. Homolysis may also be achieved by the action of radiation (usually ultraviolet), in which case it is termed photolysis.  Examples are the dissociation of 2,2'-azobis (2-cyanopropane) and the formation of free radicals from benzophenone and benzoin.<br><br>
Redox reactions can also be used to generate free radicals. In this case an oxidising agent is paired with a reducing agent which then undergo a redox reaction.  Some examples of appropriate pairs in the context of the invention are ammonium persulphate/sodium metabisulphite, cumyl hydroperoxide/ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide/ascorbic acid.<br>
Preferred initiators are be selected from the following: Homolytic: benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, ammonium persulphate, 2,2'-azobis (cyanopropane), benzophenone, benzoin. Redox: ammonium persulphate/sodium metabisulphite mixture, cumyl hydroperoxide/ferrous ion mixture and/or hydrogen peroxide/asorbic acid mixture.  Preferred initiators are ammonium persulphate and hydrogen peroxide/asorbic acid mixture.  The preferred level of initiator is in the range of from 0.1 to 5.0 % w/w by weight of monomer, more preferably, the level is in the range of from 1.0 to 3.0 % w/w by weight of monomer.<br>
Chain transfer agents can optionally be used to reduce the degree of polymerisation and hence the final molecular weight of the polymer.  A chain transfer agent contains very-labile hydrogen atoms that are easily abstracted by a propagating polymer chain.  This terminates the polymerisation of the growing polymer, but generates a new reactive site on the chain transfer agent that can then proceed to initiate further polymerisation of the remaining monomer.  Chain transfer agents in the context of the invention typically contain thiol (mercaptan) functionality<br><br>
and can be represented by the general chemical formula RS-H, such as n-dodecyl mercaptan and 2-mercaptoethanol.<br>
Preferred chain transfer agents are monothioglycerol and n-dodecyl mercaptan, used at levels of, preferably from 0 to 5 % w/w based on the weight of the monomer and more preferably at a level of 0.25 % w/w based on the weight of the monomer.<br>
The Lubricant<br>
A wide range of lubricants may be used in the present invention.  The lubricants are biodegradable.<br>
The lubricant in the context of the present invention is a sugar polyester (SPE).  They are known in fabric conditioners and/or softeners.  These materials are non¬toxic and inherently biodegradable.<br>
Typically these materials are the products obtainable by esterification of a sugar, such as a saccharide (or other cyclic polyol), with a fatty material.  In the context of the invention, the sugar is preferably a disaccharide, preferably sucrose, that is esterified with fatty acid, wherein the degree of esterification is from 1 (mono) to 8 (octa). The fatty acid preferably has a chain length of from C12 to C22 and may be monounsaturated. Examples of suitable fatty acids are Laurie (C12), Myristic(C14), Palmitic(C16), Stearic(C18), Oleic(C18:1), Behenic{C22) and Erucic(C22:l<br><br>
The Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) value of the SPE's that are suitable for use in the invention are suitably from 0 to 4, preferably from 0 to 2.  HLB is a well known parameter to those skilled in the art and a literature reference is: "Modern Aspects of Emulsion Science", The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1998, page 179. Sugar polyesters can be represented by the formula below:-<br>
C12H1403(OR)n(OH)8-n		<br>
where R = COCnH2n+1 or C0CnH2n-1 (for unsaturated fatty acids)<br>
Preferred sugar polyesters are sucrose polyesters. Preferred sucrose polyesters are selected from sucrose tetrastearate and sucrose tetraerucate, most preferably sucrose tetraerucate.  It should be noted that these sucrose polyesters normally contain a spread of degree of substitution on the saccharide rings, for example, sucrose tetrastearate also comprises tristearate, pentastearate, hexastearate, etc.  Furthermore, the sugar polyesters may contain traces of surfactant which is separate from the main surfactant and the co-surfacant.<br>
A highly preferred sugar polyester for use in the present invention is ER-290 ex Mitsubishi Ryoto, which is a sucrose tetraerucate and according to the manufacturers spec is mainly Pentaerucate, Tetraerucate and Hexaerucate and has a HLB value of 2.<br><br>
The lubricant (such as a sugar polyester) can be incorporated into the particle at a wide range of levels. For example, of from 0.1 to 99 %, preferably from 50 to 99 % by weight of the total grafted particle.<br>
Further suitable lubricants are amino functional silicone oils such as Rhodorsil Oil Extrasoft supplied by Rhodia Silicones.  Other silicones may be selected from those disclosed GB 1,549,180A, EP 459,821A2 and EP 459,822A. Other suitable lubricants include any of those known for use as dye bath lubricants in the textile industry.<br>
The Polysaccharide<br>
The polysaccharide preferably has a β-1, 4-linked backbone.<br>
*<br>
Preferably the polydaccharide is a cellulose, a cellulose derivative, or another p-l,4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as  polymannan, polyglucan, polyglucomannan, polyxyloglucan and polygalactomannan.  More preferably, the polysaccharide is selected from the group consisting of polyxyloglucan and polygalactomannan.  For example, preferred polysaccharides are locust bean gum, tamarind xyloglucan, guar gum or mixtures thereof.  Most preferably, the polysaccharide is locust bean gum.<br>
The polysaccharide acts as a delivery aid/deposition agent for the particle.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide backbone has only β-1,4 linkages.  Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the β-1,4 linkages, such as β-1,3 linkages.<br><br>
Thus, optionally some other linkages are present. Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are therefore not in themselves counted in determining the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is present at levels of between 0.1% to 10% w/w by weight of the monomer, preferably 2% w/w by weight of monomer.<br>
Grafted Polysaccharide<br>
The polysaccharide is grafted to the polymer particle.  By grafted as used herein, in. the context of the invention, is meant attached.  Attachment may be by means of a covalent bond, entanglement or strong adsorption, preferably by a covalent bond or entanglement and most preferably by means of a covalent bond.  By entanglement as used herein is meant that the polysaccharide is adsorbed onto the particle during ■the particle formation stage and consequently, as the polymerisation proceeds and the particle grows in size, part of the adsorbed polysaccharide becomes buried within the interior of the particle.  Hence at the end of the polymerisation, part of the polysaccharide is entrapped and<br><br>
treatment of fabric, preferably cotton.  Such treatment may provide a softening, lubricating, crease reduction, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour preservation and/or anti-pilling benefit to the fabric.<br>
Alternatively, the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle may be incorporated into a laundry treatment composition and used in the treatment of fabric, preferably cotton.<br>
As mentioned above, the particles of the invention may be thought of as "hairy particles".  The term "hairy particles" is known in the art and is generally defined as particles with attached polymer chains such that part of the polymer is attached or buried in the particle matrix and the remainder of the polymer is free to extend into the surrounding water phase.<br>
Processes for Preparation<br>
A suitable process for the preparation oi the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles of the invention is one that comprises miniemulsion.<br>
Miniemulsion polymerisation is well known in the art and the term "miniemulsion polymerisation" as used herein means the same as the term known in the art.  Numerous scientific reviews of miniemulsion techniques have been published:<br>
1)  El Aasser, M.S./ Miller, CM., "Preparation of latexes using miniemulsions", In: Asua, J.M., editor.  Polymeric<br><br>
bound in the particle polymer matrix, whilst the remainder is free to extend into the aqueous phase.<br>
By strong adsorption as used herein is meant strong adsorption of the polysaccharide to the surface of the particle; such adsorption can, for example, occur due to hydrogen bonding, Van Der Waals or electrostatic attraction between the polysaccharide chains and the particle.<br>
The grafted polysaccharide is thus mainly attached to the particle surface and is not, to any significant extent, distributed throughout the internal bulk of the particle. This is distinct from graft copolymers in which a polysaccharide may be grafted along the length of a polymer chain.  A particle which is formed from a graft copolymer would, therefore, contain polysaccharide throughout the internal bulk of the particle as well as on the particle surface.  Thus the particle which is produced according to the process of the invention can be thought of as a "hairy particle", which is different from a graft copolymer.  This feature of the invention provides significant cost reduction opportunities for the manufacturer as much less polysaccharide is required to achieve the same level of activity as systems which utilise polysaccharide copolymers.<br>
The Polysaccharide-grafted Particle<br>
When used in laundering, the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle deposits onto the fabric, preferably cotton, at higher levels than non-polysaccharide particles.  The polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle may be used in the<br><br>
dispersions.  Principles and applications.  Dordrecht: Kluwer, p. 109-126 (1997).<br>

Miniemulsions generally lie in between macroemulsion and microemulsions in terms of droplet size and emulsion stability.  Miniemulsion droplets typically range in size from 50 to 500 nm.  The emulsion can be stable for as little as a few days or for as long as a month.  The droplets may be stabilised by the addition of an ionic surfactant (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate) and a cosurfactant.  The latter usually consists of either a long chain alkane (e.g. hexadecane) or an alcohol (e.g. hexadecanol).  The function of the cosurfactant is twofold; it acts in combination with the surfactant to create a barrier to droplet/droplet coalescence by arranging at the oil-water interface and it also limits diffusion of the oil phase from smaller to larger droplets by virtue of its low water solubility.<br>
Miniemulsions are typically formed by subjecting an oil (monomer), water, surfactant and cosurfactant system to high shear fields created by devices such as  ultrasonifiers, homogenisers and microfluidisers.  These devices rely on mechanical shear and/or cavitation to break the oil phase into submicron size droplets.  When monomer is used as the<br><br>
oil phase, free radical polymerisation can subsequently be carried out by the addition of an initiator (e.g. ammonium persulphate).  Such a process in which the miniemulsion droplets are converted to polymer particles is referred to as miniemulsion polymerisation'.  For the sake of clarity, by "miniemulsion droplet or emulsion droplet" as used herein is meant the miniemulsion droplet before it is polymerised, and "emulsion particles" means the polymerised miniemulsion droplets.<br>
In conventional emulsion polymerisation the monomer diffuses through the aqueous phase to the surfactant formed micelles. Particle nucleation begins and proceeds in these micelles and the monomer droplets merely act as a reservoir of monomer.  Whereas in miniemulsion polymerisation the presence of cosurfactant and the use of high shear results in the formation of small monomer droplets.  These droplets are polymerised directly and no monomer diffusion to micelles occurs and no particle formation occurs within micelles.  Such differences are well documented in the literature for example in 'Emulsion Polymerisation and Emulsion Polymers",  Edited by P.A.   Lovell  and M.S.   El-Aasser,   John  Wiley and Sons,   Chapter 20, page  700-703.<br>
In conventional emulsion polymerisation, the benefit agent can only be incorporated at relatively low levels (typically 10 % or less by weight of the particle) and must be sparingly water soluble, have low molecular weight<br>
(typically under 1,000 g mol-1 )and have similar water<br>
solubility and diffusion rate as the monomer.  However, for the miniemulsion polymerisation, none of these restraints<br><br>
apply. This allows the incorporation of higher levels (typically from 10 to 90%) and a wider variety of benefit agents, such as completely water insoluble benefit agents (e.g. sugar polyesters, silicone resins and thermoplastic elastomers), in polymer particles, which cannot be achieved using conventional emulsion polymerization techniques. Furthermore inorganic particles can also be incorporated into the polymer using miniemulsion, which cannot be achieved using conventional emulsion.<br>
Preferably, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	preparation of a miniemulsion (comprising monomers, a lubricant and a cosurfactant), and<br>
(b)	polymerization of the miniemulsion of step (a), wherein grafting of the polysaccharide to the polymer particles occurs in step (b).<br>
Step (a) may consist of the following sub-steps :<br>
(i)       monomers and the lubricant are mixed with a cosurfactant to form a<br>
mixture (y), (ii)      a polysaccharide and a surfactant are dissolved in water to form a mixture<br>
(z), (iii)     (y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear to form an emulsion, (iv)     the emulsion of step (iii) is then subjected to further shear (such as<br>
sonication or other suitable high pressure homogeniser such as<br>
Microfluidiser or a Manton Gaulin homogeniser) top form a<br>
miniemulsion<br><br>
apply.  This allows the incorporation of higher levels (typically from 10 to 90 %) and a wider variety of benefit agents, such as completely water insoluble benefit agents (e.g. sugar polyesters, silicone resins and thermoplastic elastomers), in polymer particles, which cannot be achieved using conventional emulsion polymerisation techniques. Furthermore inorganic particles can also be incorporated into the polymer using miniemulsion, which cannot be achieved using conventional emulsion.<br>
Preferably, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	preparation of a miniemulsion (comprising monomers, a lubricant and a cosurfactant), and<br>
(b)	polymerisation of the miniemulsion of step (a), wherein grafting of the polysaccharide to the polymer particles occurs in step (b).<br>
Step (a) may consist of the following sub-steps:<br>
(i)   monomers and the lubricant are mixed with a cosurfactant to form a mixture (y),<br>
(ii)   a polysaccharide and a surfactant are dissolved in water to form a mixture (z),<br>
(iii) (y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear to form an emulsion,<br>
(iv)   the emulsion of step (iii) is then subjected to<br>
further, shear (such as sonication or other suitable high pressure homogeniser such as a Microfluidiser or a Manton Gaulin homoqeniser) to form a miniemulsion.<br><br>
By mixed is meant mixed or dissolved, depending on the physical state of the lubricant.<br>
Preferably, an initiator is added to the miniemulsion such that polymerisation of the monomers (and simultaneous grafting' of the polysaccharide onto the polymer particles) proceeds. The initiator can be added during step (a), for example if an initiator that is soluble in the monomer is used, or in step (b).<br>
A preferred process comprises the steps of:<br>
(i)  monomers and a lubricant are mixed with a cosurfactant<br>
to form a mixture (y), (ii) a polysaccharide and a surfactant are dissolved in<br>
water to form a mixture (z), (iii) (y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear<br>
to form a miniemulsion and (iv) an initiator is added such that polymerisation (and<br>
simultaneous grafting of the polysaccharide onto the<br>
polymer particles) proceeds.<br>
Alternatively, the surfactant of step (ii) may be a reactive surfactant, by which is meant that it comprises groups that may participate in.the polymerisation and a hydrophilic group.  In this case it will be combined with the monomer in step (1) .<br>
The resulting polymer particles have a particle size of less than 1 micron, more preferably of less than 500 nm.<br><br>
High Shear as used herein is applied using any suitable apparatus such as an ultrasound sonicator, microfluidizer or homogenizer.  High Shear as used in step (iv) above is defined as shear of sufficiently high intensity that the' emulsion of step (iii) above is reduced in particle size to sub-micron dimensions, preferably under 500 nm.  Suitably, the emulsion of step (iv) is formed using a high shear homogeniser at 10,000 to 24,000 rpm for approximately 30 seconds to 5 minutes and then sonified using a probe ultrasound sonicator (at maximum power output) for 10 minutes to generate the miniemulsion.  A suitable homogeniser is a Manton Gaulin homogeniser or any other make of high shear homogenizer such as an Ultra Turrax.<br>

Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark) and non-phosphate stabilisers such as EDDS (ethylene diamine di-succinic acid).  These bleach stabilisers are also useful for stain removal especially in products containing low levels of bleaching species or no bleaching species.<br>
An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A, EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).<br>

The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing.  Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%.  However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
Powder flow may be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or fatty acid soap), a sugar, an acrylate or acrylate/maleate copolymer, or sodium silicate.  One preferred powder structurant is fatty acid soap, suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%.<br>

This list is not intended to be exhaustive. However, many of these ingredients will be better delivered as benefit agent groups in materials produced according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by<br>
spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive • ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry.  The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not.<br><br>
Particulate detergent compositions of the invention preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/litre, mor preferably at least 500 g/litre.  Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densification of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever)•<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations.  Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>

If the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles are to be incorporated in a powder (optionally the powder to be tableted), and whether or not pre-emulsified, they are<br><br>
optionally included in a separate granular component, e.g. also containing a water soluble organic or inorganic material, or in encapsulated form.<br>
Substrate,	<br>
When used in laundering, the substrate may be any substrate onto which it is desirable to deposit polymer particles and which is subjected to treatment such as a washing or rinsing process.<br>
In particular, the substrate may be a textile fabric.  It has been found that particularly good results are achieved when using a natural fabric substrate such as cotton, or fabric blends containing cotton.<br>
Treatment<br>
The treatment of the substrate with the material of the invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the substrate.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or rinse cycle of a washing machine and involves contacting the substrate with an aqueous medium comprising the material of the invention.<br>
