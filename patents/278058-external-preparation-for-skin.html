THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an external preparation for skin. More precisely, the invention relates to an external preparation for skin which contains an alkylresorcinol and has excellent temperature stability {particularly high-temperature stability) and photostability. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Alkylresorcinols are known to have a melanin production inhibitory effect and an antimicrobial effect, and are incorporated into cosmetics for the purpose of skin whitening and antimicrobial protection (e.g., see Patent References 1 and 2).  In addition to the above-mentioned alkylresorcinols, there are known L-ascorbic acid and L-ascorbic acid derivatives as substances having a skin-whitening effect; and there have been proposed external preparations for skin containing an alkylresorcinol and an L-ascorbic acid (= L-ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid derivative). (e.g., see Patent References 3 and 4). Alkylresorcinols and L-ascorbic acids each have a problem in that they tend to become discolored due to temperature and light; however, sufficient investigations have not as yet been made for the technique of effectively preventing the discoloration of alkylresorcinols and L-ascorbic acids.

Patent Reference 1: JP 2-049715A<br>
Patent Reference 2: JP 4-169511A<br>
Patent Reference 3: JP 2004-277352A<br>
Patent Reference 4; JP 2005-120023A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an external preparation for skin which contains an alkylresorcinol and an L-ascorbic acid and which has excellent temperature stability (particularly high-temperature  stability)   and photostability. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The present inventors made intensive studies for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, and found that any one alone of an alkylresorcinol and an L-ascotbic acid discolors due to temperature and light, but when an alkylresorcinol, especially 4-isobutyl resorcinol or its salt, is combined with an L-ascorbic acid compound, especially L-ascorbic acid or its salt or 3-0-alkyl-L-ascorbic acid or its salt, in a specific ratio, then the resulting combination exhibits an excellent photostability effect and temperature (high-temperature) stability effect, and have thereby completed the present invention.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to an external preparation for skin comprising {a} from 0.01 to 5% by mass of 4-isobutyl resorcinol or a salt thereof, and (b) from 0.01 to 5% by mass of one or more selected from L-ascorbic acid or a salt thereof and a 3-O-alkyl-L-ascorbic acid or a salt thereof.<br>
 <br>
Of the above, an embodiment where component (b) is a 3-0-alkyl-L-ascorbic acid or a salt thereof is preferred. ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, there is provided an external preparation for skin which contains an alkylresorcinol and an L-ascorbic acid derivative and has excellent temperature stability (particularly high-temperature stability) and photostability. MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is described in detail hereinunder. In the following, "POE" indicates polyoxyethylene, and "POP" indicates polyoxypropylene.<br>

When the amount is less than 0.01% by mass, then the skin-whitening effect and the antimicrobial effect may be poor; but on the other hand, incorporation in an amount of more than 5% by mass is unfavorable in view of irritation to skin.<br>
Component {b} to be used in the invention is one or more selected from among L-ascorbic acid or a salt thereof and a 3-O-alkyl-L-ascorbic acid or a salt thereof.  The 3-o-alkyl-L-ascorbic acid or its salt includes 3-o-alkyl ethers of L-ascorbic acid, such as 3-O-methyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-ethyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-propyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-isopropyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-0-n-butyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-isobutyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-tert-butyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-pentyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-hexyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-heptyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-octyl-L-ascorbic acid, 3-O-n-nonyl-L-ascorbic acid, and their salts.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by means of the following Examples which are by no means intended to limit the invention. Unless otherwise noted, the amounts in which various components are incorporated are indicated by % by mass relative to the system in which they are incorporated.<br>
(Example 1: Effect of 4-isobutyl resorcinol to prevent disco-loration/malodor of ascorbic acid or its derivatives under irradiation with sunlight (50°C))<br>
[Color Difference (AE), L value]<br>
Samples 1 to 6 shown in Table 1 below were irradiated with sunlight (50 MJ, 50°C). After the irradiation, the samples were restored to room  temperature and  analyzed  with  a   colorimeter<br>
(GretagMacbeth Color-Eye 7000A) for the color difference (AE). Those having a smaller color difference (AE) discolored less.  In addition, the transparency (L value) of the samples was measured with an integrating sphere spectrophotometer (GretagMacbeth Color-Eye 7000A).  Those having an L value nearer to 100 are more transparent.  The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[Smell]<br>
Samples 1 to 6 shown in Table 1 below were irradiated with sunlight (50 MJ, 50°C) . After the irradiation, the samples were restored to room temperature and subjected to organoleptic test by expert panelists (5 members) evaluating the smell or odor thereof. The samples were ranked in 5 stages, excellent (5 points), good (4 points), average (3 points), bad (2 points), extremely bad (1 point).<br>
 <br>
The points given by the 5 panelists were averaged, and the samples were evaluated according to the following criteria. (Evaluation)<br>
0: The average point by 5 panelists is from 4.0 to 5.0. 0: The average point by 5 panelists is from 3.0 to 3.9. A: The average point by 5 panelists is from 2.0 to 2.9. x: The average point by 5 panelists is from 1,0 to 1.9.<br>
[Color Difference Reduction (%)]<br>
Between the samples 1 and 2, the samples 3 and 4, and the samples 5 and 6, [{(color difference (AE) of the sample wherein 4-isobutyl resorcinol was not incorporated) - (color difference (AE) of the sample wherein 4-isobutyl resorcinol was incorporated)}/(color difference (AE) of the sample wherein 4-isobutyl resorcinol was not incorporated)}] x 100 (%) was computed. This indicates the effect of 4-isobutyl resorcinol to prevent discoloration of L-ascorbic acid or its derivative. Those of which the color difference reduction (%) is nearer to 100 (%) have a more excellent discoloration-preventing effect. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

As obvious from the results shown in T.able 1, the addition of 4-isobutyl resorcinol individually, or the addition of ascorbic acid or its derivative individually is poor in photostability and temperature (high-temperature) stability; however, by the combination of the two, it exerts a photostabilization effect and a temperature (high-temperature) stabilization effect.<br>
Of those having a higher effect of 4-isobutyl resorcinol, the color difference reduced more (their color difference reduction was large). As a whole, 4-isobutyl resorcinol prevents discoloration of ascorbic acids; and above all, the samples 3 and 5 using 3-0-ethyl-L-ascorbic acid or L-ascorbic acid as the L-ascorbic acid ingredient had a high color difference reduction; and in particular, the sample 3 using 3-0-ethyl-L-ascorbic acid had a color difference reduction of about 97% and had a color difference of 0.091. As in<br>
 <br>
these, the discoloration of 3-O-ethyl-L-ascorbic acid could be almost completely prevented by 4-isobutyl resorcinol.<br>
{Example 2: Prominenticy of discoloration preventing effect of 4-isobutyl resorcinol among alkylresorcinols)<br>
[Color Difference (AE), L Value]<br>
Samples 7 to 20 shown in Table 2 below were left in a thermostat bath at 50°C {under protection from light) for 2 weeks, then restored to room temperature, and analyzed with a colorimeter (GretagMacbeth Color-Eye 7000A) for the color difference (AE). Those having a smaller color difference (AE) discolored less. In addition, the transparency (L value) of the samples was measured with an integrating sphere spectrophotometer (GretagMacbeth Color-Eye 7000A) . Those having an L value nearer to 100 are more transparent. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

mass, and the amount of the other alkylresorcinols was so controlled as to be the equimolar amount to that of 4-isobutyl resorcinol. Since those alkylresorcinols were the subjects to be tested for discoloration, the molar number of the alkylresorcinols was made the same.<br>
As obvious from the results in Table 2, the data of the color difference and the L value of the sample 15 that falls within the range of the invention indicate little discoloration of the sample, from which it is known that the sample exhibited the most excellent discoloration preventing effect.<br>
