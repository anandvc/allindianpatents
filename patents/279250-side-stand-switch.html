TECHNICAL   FIELD [0001]<br>
The present  invention relates  to a side  stand switch,  and more  particularly  to  a  side  stand  switch which  can  enhance  the assembling  property  and  can  reduce  the  number  of  parts  and  a weight   thereof. BACKGROUND   ART [0002]<br>
Conventionally, with respect to a side stand switch of a motorcycle, there has been known the constitution in which a switch which determines whether a side stand bar is in a storing position or in a projecting position is mounted in the vicinity of the side stand bar. [0003]<br>
In Patent Document 1, there is disclosed a side stand of a motorcycle which mounts a rotary switch on a rotary shaft of the   side   stand  bar.<br>
[Patent   Document   1]    JP-B-6-31038<br>
DISCLOSURE   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS   THAT   THE   INVENTION   IS   TO   SOLVE<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the technique disclosed in Patent Document<br>
1, the side stand is configured such that the side stand bar<br>
is rotatably and pivotally mounted on a vehicle body frame by<br>
a bolt member, and the rotary switch is mounted by threading<br>
a mounting bolt into a threaded hole formed in a head portion<br>
of the bolt member. Accordingly, there has been a drawback that:<br>
the number of operation steps and the number of parts at the<br>
time     of     assembling     are      increased.	Further,      in     the<br>
above-mentioned constitution, it is necessary to form constitutional parts of the rotary switch with metal or the like to prevent the deformation of the rotary switch even when the rotary switch is fastened by mounting bolts thus giving rise to a drawback that a weight of the rotary switch is easily increased. [0005]<br>
Further, in the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, a semicircular plate which has a center point thereof aligned with a center point of a rotary axis of the side stand bar is applied to a movable-side contact of the rotary switch and hence, it is difficult to increase a power supply angle of the switch. Accordingly, the constitution which further increases the power supply angle of the rotary switch and makes the contact pressure between the movable contact and the fixed contact uniform is still   less   than  optimum.<br>
[0006]<br>

[0026]<br>
According to the first invention, the base and the rotary which constitute the side stand switch are formed of the resin and hence, the side stand switch can be made light-weighted. Further, the rotary and the rotary shaft as well as the rotary and the base are respectively mounted using the engaging mechanisms and hence, joining members such as mounting bolts become no more necessary whereby the assembling property is enhanced   and,    at   the   same   time,    the   number   of   parts   can   be<br>
reduced. [0027]<br>
According  to   the   second  invention,   the   first   engaging mechanism  and  the  second  engaging  mechanism  are  formed  on  the same    cylindrical    portion    and    hence,     it     is    possible     to miniaturize   the  engaging  mechanisms. [0028]<br>
According to the third invention, the first engaging mechanism and the second engaging mechanism are constituted by the convex and concave engagement by the groove and the projecting portion and hence, it is possible to realize the respective engaging mechanisms using the simple constitution. [0029]<br>
According  to  the  fourth  invention,   in  mounting  the  side stand  switch on  the  rotary  shaft,   there  is  no possibility that a  biased  load  is  applied  to  the  second  engaging  mechanism  and hence,   the  mounting  can  be  performed  favorably. [0030]<br>
According to the fifth invention, due to the gap, the expansion of the cylindrical portion which is generated at the time of removing the cylindrical portion from the rotary shaft-is allowed and hence, the mounting and dismounting of the side stand switch with respect to the rotary shaft can be performed easily. [0031]<br>
According to the sixth invention, by forming the groove in the rotary shaft side which is formed of the hard material such as metal or the like, the production steps can be simplified compared to a case in which the projecting portion is formed on the rotary shaft side. Further, by changing shapes of the groove and the projecting portion, the joining strength attributed to the first engaging mechanism can be easily adjusted.<br>
[0032]<br>
According to the seventh invention, by forming the projecting portion at an arbitrary position in the circumferential direction, it is possible to set the side stand such that side stand switch can be easily mounted or dismounted only when the side stand is rotated to a predetermined position.<br>
[0033]<br>
According to the eighth invention, by changing the shapes of the groove and the projecting portion, it is possible to easily adjust the joining strength due to the second engaging mechanism.<br>
[0034]<br>
According to the ninth invention,  it is possible to surely perform   the   positioning   of   the   rotary   and   the   side   stand Further,   a   load  applied  to  the  rotary  can  be   received  with  a large  area  due  to  the  irotation  of  the  side  stand  and  hence,   a burden   imposed  on   the   rotary  can  be   reduced.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the  tenth invention,  with the  small  forming applied  to  the  constitutional  parts,   it  is  possible  to  surely perform  the  positioning   of   the   rotary  and  the   side   stand. [0036]<br>
According to the eleventh invention,  the rotary shaft can be  used as  a  common-use part  which  is  also  compatible  to  a  side stand  switch  of  a  conventional  type  which  is  mounted  using  a mounting  bolt. [0037]<br>
According to the twelfth invention, by radially arranging the leaf springs which, constitute the movable contact in the radial direction, it is possible to make the contact pressure with the fixed contact uniform. Further, by arranging the plurality of fixed contact concentrically, it is possible to ensure a wide rotary angle of the movable contact in the same conductive state. [0038]<br>
According to the thirteenth invention and fourteenth invention, it is possible to obtain the side stand switch which can make the contact pressure of the movable contact to the fixed contact uniform over the whole periphery of the rotary switch and can ensure a large power supply angle. [0039]<br>
According to the fifteenth invention,  the movable contact<br>
is constituted of the annular plate which has the recessed portions and the projecting portions thereon and hence, it is possible to easily manufacture the movable contacts with least irregularities in quality by press forming. Further, the resiliently repulsive member is stored in each one of the plurality of the recessed portions of the movable contacts and hence, the uniform contact pressure is applied to the respective recessed portions thus generating the uniform contact pressure over the whole movable contact. Further, by allowing the resiliently repulsive members to be engaged with the recessed portions, it is possible to hold the resiliently repulsive members with respect to the movable contacts  in a stable manner<br>
[0040]<br>
According to the sixteenth invention, in forming the movable contacts by press forming or the like, it is possible to form the contacts and the recessed portion simultaneously thus   reducing  manufacturing  man-hours.<br>
[0041]<br>
According to the seventeenth invention, the inner rotor and the outer rotor are formed as separate bodies from each other and hence, an operation for assembling the oil seal between the inner rotor and the outer rotor is facilitated. Further, the oil seal is housed between the base and the rotary and hence, it is possible to ensure the sealing property between the base and  the   rotary.<br>
[0042]<br>
According to the eighteenth invention, it is possible to perform the positioning of the rotary and the side stand using the simple constitution. Further, a load which is generated at the time of rotating the side stand is received by a large area of the side engaging portion and hence, it is possible to reduce the load which is applied to the rotary compared to a method which forms positioning pins. [0043]<br>
According to the nineteenth invention, it is possible to connect the rotary shaft of the side stand and the side stand switch using the bolt-fixing structure substantially equal to the conventional bolt-fixing structure: and hence, it is possible to enhance the general-use purpose of the side stand switch.<br>

Further,   a  swing  arm  10  which  has  one end  portion  thereof  connected  to  a  lower  portion  of  the  main frame  4  is  tiltable by being  suspended by a  rear cushion  9 which is  mounted  on  the  rear  frame  5,   while  a  rear  wheel  WR  which  is rotated  by  a  driving  force  which  is  generated  by  the  engine  6 is   pivotally  supported,   in  another   end  portion. [0047]<br>
On a bracket 21 which is mounted on a lower portion of the vehicle body of the main frame 4, a side stand bar 20 is rotatably mounted by a pivot bolt 4 0 which constitutes a rotary shaft thus allowing the motorcycle 1 self-standing at a projecting  position  shown  in  the  drawing  due   to  three  points<br>
consisting of a front wheel WF, the rear wheel WR and the side stand bar 20. In this embodiment, a switch unit (see Fig. 2) described later is mounted on a shaft of the pivot bolt 40, and it is possible to determine whether the side stand bar 2 0 is at the projecting position or a storing position based on the switch unit. Here, an ignition unit 11 which is arranged in the vicinity of a fuel tank 7 is configured to receive the above-mentioned determination information from a wiring cord 13 which is connected to the switching unit and, at the same time and, to prohibit the supply of electricity to a high tension cord 12 which is connected to an ignition plug (not shown in the drawing) of an engine 6 based on the determination information. Due to the above-mentioned constitution, for example , when the side stand bar 2 0 is at the; projecting position shown in the drawing, it is possible to prevent the engine 6 from being started. [0048]<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing the side stand bar 2 0 and the constitutional parts arranged in the vicinity of the side stand bar 20. A fitting hole 30 into which the pivot bolt 40 is fitted is formed in a bracket 21 mounted on the main frame 4, and a hook pin 29 which has a grooved portion 29a is mounted on the bracket 21 in the vicinity of the fitting hole 30. Further, the above-mentioned side stand bar 20 made of metal or the  like  is  configured such that  an approximately elliptical<br>
ground plate 24, a hook pin 25 and an approximately U-shaped pivot portion 26 are mounted on a body portion 23 which is lend in the vehicle-body-outside-direction. A fitting hole 2 7 which allows the fitting of the pivot bolt 40 therein and a pin hole 28 into which a positioning pin described later is inserted are formed in the pivot portion 26. Further, the pivot bolt 4 0 which is integrally formed using metal or the like is configured to include an engaging shaft 44 which forms a groove portion 44a thereon in the circumferential direction, a hexagonal head 43 which is used at the time of fastening, a columnar slide portion 41, and a threaded portion 42 which is threadedly engaged with a nut 91. [0049]<br>
A   switch   unit   5 0   according   to   one   embodiment   of   the present;   invention  is  configured  such  that  a  rotary  switch  is stored  in  the  inside  of  a  base  51  made  of  a  resin  or  the  like, wherein  an  approximately-U-shaped  engaging  portion  57  and  the connector   52   are  provided  to  one  end  portion  of   the  base   51 The  connector  52   is  configured  such  that  the  connector  52   is connected  to  one  end  side  of   the  wiring  cord  13    (see  Fig.   1 thus  enabling  the  outputting  of  a  signal  from  the  rotary switch to   the   ignition  unit   11. [0050]<br>
In        assembling	the	above-mentioned	respective<br>
constitutional   parts,     first    of    all,    the   pivot   bolt.    40    is<br>
inserted into the fitting hole 2 7 while engaging the U-shaped portion of the pivot portion 26 with the bracket 21, and the nut 91 is threadedly engaged with the threaded portion 42 on a back surface side of the bracket 21. Then, the switch unit 5 0 can be mounted by engaging the engaging portion 5 7 with the hook pin 29 and, at the same time, by pushing the engaging shaft 4 4 of the pivot bolt 4 0 into the engaging hole formed on the back surface side of the base 51 (see Fig. 4) thus engaging the engaging shaft 44 and the engaging hole. Accordingly, bolts or the like become unnecessary in mounting the switch unit 50 and hence, the mounting operation of the switch unit 50 can be facilitated. Here, by engaging an upper hook 90a of the spring 90 with the groove portion 2 9a of the hook pin 2 9 and, at the same time, by engaging a lower hook 90b with the hook pin 2 5 of the body portion 23, the spring 90 has a function of imparting a biasing force such that the side stand bar 20 can be stably held at the storing position or the projecting position. [0051]<br>
Fig. 3 is a front view showing a state in which the side stand bar 2 0 and the switch unit 50 are mounted on the bracket. 21. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols; indicate identical or similar parts. The side stand bar 20 of this embodiment is configured to be rotatable within a range of approximately 110 degree from a projecting position indicated  by a  solid  line  in  the  drawing  to  a  storing  position<br>
2 0a  at  which  the   side   stand  bar  2 0   assumes   an  approximately<br>
horizontal     posture.	Further,      in     the     drawing,      as     a<br>
predetermined intermediate position 2 0b between the projecting position and the storing position 20a, a position at which a center 2 9c of the hook pin 2 9 on the bracket 21 side, a center 44c of the engaging shaft 44 and a center 25c (see Fig. 2) of the hook pin 25 on the body portion 23 side of the side stand bar 2 0 are arranged on one straight line, that is, a neutral position is shown. [0052]<br>
As   the   predetermined   intermediate   position,    the   side stand  bar   2 0   can  be   arbitrarily   set   between   the  projecting position       and       the       storing      position       other       than       the above-mentioned  neutral  position. [0053]<br>
The base 51 of the switch unit 50 is supported on the bracket; 21 in a non-rotatable manner by two points consisting of the above-mentioned, hook pin 29 and the pivot bolt 40. To the contrary, a rotary switch which is housed in the above-mentioned base 51 includes a rotary 53 which is provided with a positioning pin 5 5 to be engaged with the pin hole 2 8 (see Fig. 4) , wherein the rotary switch is configured such that; a switch output is changed due to the integral rotation of the rotary 53 with the side stand bar 20. [0054]<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing a back surface side of the switch unit 50. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts The rotary 53 is rotatably engaged with the back surface side of the base 51, that is, a surface side which is mounted on the pivot bolt 40 by way of an annular oil seal 56 . The rotary 53 is made of a resin or the like in the same manner as the base 51, wherein a cylindrical portion 54 with which the engaging shaft 44 is engaged is formed on an approximately center of the base 51 and, at the same time, a positioning pin 55 is integrally formed on a wall surface of a radially outside end portion. On an inner peripheral surface 54b of the cylindrical portion 54 of the rotary 53 of this embodiment, a projection 54a (see Fig. 5) constituting a projecting portion which is engaged with the engaging groove 44a of the engaging shaft 4 4 is formed. [0055]<br>
Fig. 5 is a front view of the switch unit 50 and the side stand bar 20. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used, symbols indicate identical or similar parts . The drawing shows a state in which the side stand bar 2 0 is arranged, at a predetermined intermediate position and at a neutral position (a position at which the center position 29c of the hook pin 29, the center 44c of the engaging shaft 44 and the center 25c of the hook pin 2 5 are arranged on one straight line) . On an inner  peripheral  surface  54b  of  the  cylindrical  portion  54 ,   a<br>
pair of approximately semi-circular projections 54a which are arranged orthogonally with the center therebetween is integrally formed. By engaging the projections 54a with the engaging groove 44a formed in the engaging shaft 44, the rotary 53 (see Fig. 4) is rotatably and pivotally supported with respect to the center of the pivot bolt 40. Here, the pivot bolt 40 is configured to be integrally rotated with the side stand bar 20. Here, the projection 54a is, for example, at illustrated in the drawing, rotatable about the center line which connects the hook pin 29 and the engaging shaft 44. Further, in engaging the: cylindrical portion 54 and the engaging shaft 44, the base 51 and the rotary 53 are preliminarily set as a small unit and, by strongly pushing the base 51 into the engaging shaft 44, the projection 54a and the vicinity of the projection 54a which constitute a portion of the resilient deformable resin part of the rotary 53 are slightly deformed. [0056]<br>
On the other hand, the rotary 53 and the base 51 are preliminarily assembled, and by engaging the cylindrical portion 54 and a fitting portion 60 which is formed in the base 51, the rotary 53 and the base 51 are rotatably pivotally supported. Further, in the fitting portion 6 0 according to this embodiment, a gap 61 attributed to the formation of a notchec portion which is not brought into contact with an outei peripheral  surface  of  the  cylindrical  portion  54  is  formed  or<br>
a portion of an inner peripheral surface thereof. The gap 6] may be, for example, formed on a line which connects a center 2 9c of the hook pin 2 9 and a center 44c of the engaging shaft 44. Further, due to the arrangement relationship between the projection 54a and the gap 61 shown in the drawing, in a state that the side stand bar 20 is arranged at a predetermined intermediate position and at a neutral position, the gap 61 is arranged radially outside the projection 54a. Accordingly, in this embodiment, by arranging the side stand bar 20 at the predetermined intermediate position and at the neutral position , there exists the gap 61 which allows the deformation of the projection 54a and around the projection 54a radially outside the projection 54a and hence, the mounting and dismounting of the engaging shaft 44 and the cylindrical portion 54 can be easily performed. Further, when the side stand bar 2 0 is rotated to the above-mentioned predetermined intermediate position and a position different from the neutral position in a state that the engagement between the engaging shaft 44 and the cylindrical portion 55 is maintained, the positions of the projection 54a and the gap 61 are displaced from each other and hence, the projection 54a and the vicinity of the projection 54a are hardly deformed. That is, it is possible to make the mounting and the dismounting of the engaging shaft 44 and the cylindrical portion 54 difficult. Here, by setting the intermediate  position  ait  the  neutral  position,   even  when  the<br>
switch  unit  is  mounted  in  an  inverted  mariner  with  respect  tc a  center  line,   the  neutral  position  is  not  changed  and  hence, the  degree   of   freedom  of  mounting   is   enhanced. [0057]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in Fig. 5. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. The drawing also shows the arrangement relationship between the bracket 21 and the nut 91. As mentioned previously, the rotary 53 on which the positioning pin 55 is mounted is configured to be integrally rotatable with the side stand bar 20 with, respect to the base 51 which is fixedly supported due to the hook pin 2 9 and the engaging shaft 44 . Further, a first engaging mechanism 62 which is constituted of the projection 54a (see Fig. 5) and the engaging groove 44a is provided between the engaging shaft 4 4 and. the cylindrical portion 54, while a second engaging mechanism 63 is provided between the cylindrical portion 54 and the base 51. Due to such a constitution, the first engaging mechanism 62 is provided more inside than the second engaging mechanism 6 3 in the axial direction and hence, it is possible? to facilitate an operation in which the base 51 and the rotary 53 are preliminarily assembled as a small unit due to the second engaging mechanism 63 and the rotary 53 is fitted on the engaging shaft 44. Here, a connector terminal 52a which is connected with a contact  of  the  rotary switch described  later  is  arranged<br>
inside   the   connector   52. [0058]<br>
Fig. 7 is a partially enlarged view of Fig. 6. Symbols<br>
which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate<br>
identical or similar parts. The first engaging mechanism 62<br>
is constituted of a pair of projections 54a, 54a of the<br>
cylindrical portion 54 and an engaging groove 44a which is<br>
formed on the whole circumference of the engaging shaft 44.<br>
Further, the second engaging mechanism 63 (see Fig. 6) is<br>
constituted of a projection 58a which is formed on the whole<br>
circumference of an inner peripheral surface of the fitting<br>
portion 60 and an engaging groove 54c which is formed on the<br>
whole circumference of an outer peripheral surface of the<br>
cylindrical    portion    54.	Further,     in    the     rotary    switch<br>
according to this embodiment is constituted of a fixed contact 8 5 which is supported on the base 51 and a movable contact 7 0 which is supported on the rotary 53. The movable contact 70 which is supported on the support portion 53a of the rotary 53 is configured such that the movable contact 70 is brought into contact with the fixed contact 85 connected to the connector terminal 52a, wherein due to the rotation of the rotary 53 along with the rotation of the side stand bar 20, the contact position of the movable contact 70 with the fixed contact 85 is changed The first engaging mechanism 62 may be constituted by forming a   groove    in   the   cylindrical   portion   54    and   by   mounting   a<br>
projection on the engaging shaft 44. Further, the second engaging mechanism 63 may be formed by forming a groove on an inner peripheral surface side of the fitting portion 6 0 and by forming a projection on an outer peripheral surface side of the cylindrical portion 54. [0059]<br>
Further, in the switch unit 5 0 according to this embodiment, an oil seal 56 which protects the rotary switch from moisture and dusts is provided to only one portion between a contact surface 51b of the base 51 and a contact surface 53b of the rotary 53. In a conventional method which mounts the rotary switch on a head portion of the pivot bolt 40 by using a mounting bolt, due to the structure of the rotary switch, a sealing member becomes necessary also in the vicinity of an engaging hole of the mounting bolt and hence, the sealing member is arranged at two portions thus increasing the number of parts and the thickness of the switch unit. To the contrary, in the switch unit 50 according to this embodiment, the number of parts and the thickness of the; switch unit in the axial direction can be largely reduced compared to the conventional method Further, it is unnecessary for the base 51 and the rotary 53 to possess the rigidity to withstand a fastening force of the mounting bolt and hence, the base 51 and the rotary 53 may be made of a resin or the like thus realizing the reduction of weight thereof.<br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line B-B<br>
in Fig. 7. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used<br>
symbols indicate identical or similar parts. Fig. 8 shows a<br>
portion of the first engaging mechanism 62 (see Fig. 6) which<br>
is arranged between the engaging shaft 44 and the cylindrical<br>
portion 54 and, at the same time, is constituted of the<br>
proj ection 54a and the engaging groove 44a . In this embodiment,<br>
by setting the side stand bar 20 at the predetermined<br>
intermediate position (see Fig. 5), the gap 61 is positioned<br>
radially outside the projection 54a and hence, the deformation<br>
of the projection 54a and the vicinity of the projection 54a<br>
is facilitated thus easing the mounting and dismounting of the<br>
switch unit 50. The predetermined intermediate position is in<br>
an instable state between the projecting position and the<br>
storing        position.	Accordingly,	the;        predetermined<br>
intermediate position is a position which, usually, makes stopping of the side stand bar 20 difficult due to the application of a biasing force of the spring 90 when a rider-projects or stores the side stand bar 2 0 by a leg portion Accordingly, in performing the maintenance, unless the rider intentionally holds the side stand bar 20 at the predetermined intermediate position, the mounting and the dismounting of the switch unit 50 become difficult. [0061]<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line C-C in Fig. 7. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. Fig. 9 shows a portion of the second engaging mechanism 63 (see Fig. 6) which is arranged between the cylindrical portion 54 and the base 51 and, at the same time, is constituted of the projection 58a and the engaging groove 54c. In the second engaging mechanism 63 different from the first engaging mechanism 62, the projection 58a is formed on the whole circumference in the circumferential direction and hence, there is no possibility that the mounting and the dismounting of the cylindrical portion 54 and the base 51 are facilitated at the predetermined rotational position. Such a constitution is adopted in view of the convenience of a manufacturing step in which the switch unit; 50 is mounted, on the vehicle body side after assembling the switch unit 50 in small 'units per part and a fact that in dismounting the switch unit 50 from the vehicle body, the engagement of the cylindrical, portion 54 and the base: 51 is disengaged prior to the mounting of the switch unit 50 from the vehicle body thus making the dismounting operation difficult. Here, after the switch unit 50 is removed from the engaging shaft 44, the cylindrical portion 54 is liable to be easily deformed toward the radially inside and hence, the rotary 53 can be easily removed from the base 53. [0062]<br>
Fig. 10 is a top plan view of the movable contact 70 which<br>
is supported on the rotary 53. The movable contact 7 0 is<br>
constituted by radially connecting three plate-like spring<br>
contacts 72, 73, 74 to an approximately circular holder 7]<br>
having the same contact center 71a as the rotary shaft of the<br>
rotary 53 at an equal interval of 12 0°. The three spring<br>
contacts 72, 73, 74 are formed in a shape reusing gradually from<br>
joining portions with the holder 71 in the depth direction in<br>
the drawing, wherein distal end portions 72a, 73a, 74a of the<br>
spring contacts 72, 73, 74 are brought into contact with the<br>
fixed     contact     85.	By     adopting     the     contact     structure<br>
constituted of the above-mentioned radial springs, compared to a conventional method which ensures a contact pressure by supporting an approximately semi-circular contact with a plurality of coil springs, it is possible to ensure a sufficient contact pressure while reducing the number of parts. Here, the distal end portions 72a, 73a, 74a are also arranged respectively at an interval of 12 0° in the same manner as the spring contacts 72, 73, 74. Further, although the distal end portions 72a, 73a are arranged concentrically about the contact center 71a, only the distal end portion 74a is arranged closer to the contact., center 71a than the distal end portions 72a, 73a. That is, by assuming a distance from the contact center 71a to a center point; 72b of the distal end portion 72a (the distance between the contact  center  71a  and  the  center  point  72b)   as  11,   a  distance<br>
from the contact center 71a to a center point 73b of the distal end portion 73a (the distance between the contact center 71a and the center point 73b) as 11, and a distance from the contact center  71a  to  a  center  point  74b  of  the  distal  end portion  74a<br>
(the distance between the contact center 71a and the center point 74b) as 12, the relationship between the distances 11. 12 is set to 11 &gt; 12. Here, the spring contact 74 which is arranged close to the contact center 71a has a smaller width compared to widths of other spring contacts 72 , 7 3 thus allowing the  respective  contacts  to  have  the  uniform  contact  pressure<br>
[0063]<br>
Fig. 11 is a top plan view of the fixed contact 85 which is supported on the base 51. The fixed contact 85 which is formed in an arcuate shape about a center point 8 5a is constituted of contacts E, F which are arranged on a rotary region of the distal end portions 72a, 73a and a contact G which is arranged on a rotary region of the distal end portion 74a In this embodiment, a distance from the center point 85a to width centers of the contacts E, F is set to 11, while a distance from the center point 8 5a to a width center of the contact G is set to 12 . By engaging the base 51 and the rotary 53 with each other in a state that the contact center 71a and the center point 8 5a are aligned with each other, the movable contact 70 is brought into   contact   with  the   fixed  contact   85.<br>
[0064]<br>
Fig.  12(a),   (b) ,   (c)  are respectively top plan views which show the  contact  relationship between the  fixed contact  8 5  ana the   movable    contact    70.       Symbols    which   are    equal    to    the previously-used  symbols  indicate  identical  or  similar  parts. Fig.   12(a)   shows  a  stand-down  state,   that  is,   a  state  in  which the  side stand bar 20  is  rotated to the projecting position  (see Fig.  3)  .     Here,  a power  supply state  of  the  contact  becomes  F-G and  hence,   the  rotary  switch which  is  constituted of  the  fixect contact  85  and the movable  contact  7 0  assumes  an OFF  state  and, at  the  same  time,   due  to  an  electric  circuit  described  later, the  supply  of  power  from  the  ignition  unit   11   (see  Fig.   1)   is prohibited.     Further,   Fig.   12(b)   shows  a  neutral  state,   that is,   a   state   in  which  the   side   stand  bar  20   is   rotated  to  the predetermined intermediate position  (and the neutral position)  . Here,   the  power  supply  state  of  the  contact  becomes  E-F-G  and hence,  the contacts assume an ON state with each other .     Further, F ig .    12 (c)    shows   a   stand-up   state,    that   is,   a   state   in  which the  side  stand  bar  20  is  rotated  to  the  storing  position   (see Fig.   3}  .     Here,   the  power  supply  state  of  the  contacts  becomes E-F  and  hence,   the   rotary  switch  assumes  an  ON  state   and,   at the   same   time,   the   supply  of  power   from  the   ignition  unit   1:, is   allowed   using   an   electric   circuit   described   later.       By adopting   the   above-mentioned   constitutions    of    the   movable contact  and the  fixed contact,  while  ensuring  the power  supply angle   similar   to   the   power   supply  angle   of   the   conventional<br>
method,    it   is   possible   to   acquire   the   rotary   switch   which, exhibits the excellent mounting property and can largely reduce the   number   of   parts. [0065]<br>
Fig. 13 shows an electric circuit 150 which performs an ignition cut of the above-mentioned engine 6 (see Fig. 1) using the rotary switch which is constituted of the fixed contact 8 5 and the movable contact 70. To an ignition coil 87 which constitutes the above-mentioned ignition unit 11 and an ignition circuit which is represented by a spark unit 88, a current is supplied through an ignition relay 8 9 which functions as a normally-open switch when the ignition relay 89 is in a. conductive state and the ignition is performed. The ignition relay 89 assumes an ON state and enables the ignition only when the contact 8 5b (the above-mentioned contact F) and the contact. 8 5a (the above-mentioned contact G) of the fixed contact 8 5 which are housed in the switch unit 50 assume an ON state, that is, when the side stand bar 20 is within a range from the storing position to the predetermined intermediate position (and the neutral position) or when a neutral switch 94 which is turned on when a shift position of a transmission is neutral assumes an ON state. Accordingly, in traveling states other than a traveling state in which the shift position of the transmission is neutral, when the side stand bar 20 is closer to the proj ecting position side than the predetermined intermediate position  (and<br>
the neutral position) , the contact 85b (contact F) , the contact 85a (contact G) assume an OFF state and, at the same time, the neutral switch 94 also assumes an OFF state and hence, the ignition relay 89 is turned off whereby the ignition is prohibited. In this case, the contact 85b (contact F) and the contact: 85c (contact E) assume an ON state and hence, a pilot lamp 92 which indicates that the side stand bar 2 0 is in a projecting  state  is  turned  on.     Here,   when  the  neutral  switch<br>
94	assumes an ON state, a pilot lamp 93 which indicates that<br>
the  shift position of  the  transmission  is  neutral  is  turned on.<br>
[0066]<br>
Cn the other hand, a starting circuit which is represented by a starter motor 99 for starting the engine, a starter motor switch 97 for controlling the supply of power to the starter motor 9 9 and a starter relay 96 is conf igured to start the engine by rotating the starter motor 99 only when the starter motor switch 97 and the starter relay 96 assume an ON state. The starter relay 96 which functions as a normally-open switch is turned on only when the starter switch 97 is turned on when the neutral   switch  94  assumes  an  ON  state  or  when  a  clutch  switch<br>
95	which  assumes  an  ON  state  when  a  clutch  is  cut  off  and  both<br>
of  the  contact  85b   (contact  F)   and  the  contact  85a   (contact  G)<br>
assume  an  ON  state,   and  a  current   flows   in  the   starter  motor<br>
99.     That  is,   when  the  side  stand bar  20  is  within  a  range  from<br>
the predetermined intermediate position  (and neutral position)<br>
to  the  projecting position,   the  engine  is  configured not  to  be started unless the neutral switch 94 assumes an ON state .     Here , a  main  switch  98  which  a  rider  manipulates   using  an  ignition key  is  provided  in  the  vicinity  of   a  battery  104. [0067]<br>
Fig.   14  is  a  front  view  of  a  switch unit  100  and  the  side stand  bar  2 0   according  to  the  modification  of  one  embodiment of   the   present   invention.      Symbols   which   are   equal   to   the previously-used  symbols  indicate  identical  or  similar  parts This modification is characterized in that engaging plates  101 102   which  are   brought   into  both   side   surfaces   of   the   pivot portion  2 6  are  provided  to  a  rotary  103   (see  Fig.   15)   which  is engaged with a back  surface  side  of  the  above-mentioned casing 15 .     Here,  in this modification,  the above-mentioned rotary 103 is   configured  to  be  engaged  with  an  engaging  shaft   106. [0068]<br>
Fig. 15 is a perspective view showing a back surface side of the above-mentioned switch unit 100 . Symbols which are equai to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. In the rotary 103 according to the modification, the engaging plates 101, 102 which extend in the same direction as the above-mentioned positioning pin 55 and constitute side engaging portions are integrally formed with a wall surface of a radially outside end portion of the rotary 103 . Further, when contact   surfaces   101a,   102a  which  are   formed  on  the  engaging<br>
plates 101, 102 are, when the above-mentioned switch unit 100 is engaged with the engaging shaft 10 6 (see Fig. 14), brought into contact with the above-mentioned pivot portion 26 such that the contact surfaces 101a, 102a sandwich the pivot portion 26 with a wide contact area .. Due to such a constitution, the rotary 53 is engaged with the pivot portions 26 at three portions in total including the positioning pin 55 and hence, it is possible to reduce a burden imposed on the positioning pin 55 when the side stand bar 20 is rotated. Further, the rotary 53 may be configured to be engaged with only the engaging plates 101, 102 without using the positioning pin 55. [0069]<br>
Fig. 16 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line D-D<br>
in Fig. 14. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used<br>
symbols      indicate      identical      or      similar      parts.	This<br>
modification is characterized in that the engaging plates 101, 102 are mounted on the rotary 10 3 and, at the same time, the engaging shaft 106 which engages the rotary 103 with the pivot bolt 1C5 is constituted of a bolt which is threaded into the pivot bolt: 105. Due to such a constitution, by removing the engaging shaft 106 from the pivot bolt 10 5 and by preparing another separate mounting bolt which is threaded into the threaded hole, it is possible to mount a switch unit of a conventional type using the mounting bolt. Accordingly, while using  the  pivot  bolt   105   as   a  common  part,    it   is  possible   to<br>
selectively mount either one of the switch unit 100 according to the present invention and the switch unit of the conventional method depending on types of vehicles or the like. Here, the movable contact 80 which is supported on the rotary 103 and the fixed contact 86 which is supported on the base 51 are described later. [0070]<br>
Fig. 17 is a cross-sectional view of the switch unit 100<br>
according to a second modification of one embodiment of the<br>
present      invention.	Symbols     which     are      equal      to     the<br>
previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. This modification is characterized in that the engaging plates 101, 102 which constitute the side engaging portions of the rotary 10 3 are mounted on a side engaging member 103a which is detachably mounted on the rotary 103 as a separate body. The above-mentioned side engaging member 103a which is made of a resin or the like is engaged with the rotary 10 3 by a third engaging mechanism 64 which adopts the convex-concave engagement as in the case of the above-mentioned second engaging mechanism 63 (see Fig. 9) . In the third engaging mechanism 64 according to this modification, although a projection is formed on the side engaging member 103a and a recessed portion is formed in the rotary 103 side, the projection and the recessed portion may be formed in an opposite manner. Further, a positioning projection   107   is   mounted  on  a  portion  of   the   side   engaging<br>
member 103a. By engaging the positioning projection 107 with the engaging groove formed in the rotary 103, it is possible to provide the constitution which allows the side engaging member 103a and the rotary 103 to be rotated integrally. Due to such a constitution, even when the engaging plates 101, 102 are provided, it is possible to easily mount and dismount the oil seal 56 thus enhancing the assembling property of the switch unit 10 0. [0071]<br>
Fig. 18 is a top plan view of the movable contact 80 which is supported on the rotary 103 according to the modification of one embodiment of the present invention. The movable contact 80 is constituted by connecting three plate-like spring contacts   82,    83,    84   having   the   same   length   radially   to   an<br>
approximately circular holder 81 at an equal interval of 120°. The three spring contacts 82 , 83 , 84 are formed in a shape raising gradually from joining portions with the holder 81 in the depth direction in the drawing, wherein distal end portions 82a, 83a, 84a of the spring contacts 82, 83, 84 are brought into contac: with the fixed contact 86. Here, the distal end portions 82a, 83a, 84a are also arranged respectively at an interval of 120' in the same manner as the spring contacts 82, 83, 84. Further, the holder 81 according to this modification is configured such that the offset axis 81b which is offset from the contact center 81a  of  the  distal  end portions  82a,   83a,   84a  by a predetermined<br>
quantity  is  aligned  with  the  rotary  shaft  of  the  rotary  103. Further,   by  assuming  a  distance  from  an  offset  axis   81b  to  a center  point   83b  of   the  distal   end  portion  83a   (the  distance between  the  offset  axis   81b  and  the  center  point   83b)   as   13, a  distance   from  the  offset  axis   81b  to  a  center  point   84b  of the distal end portion 84a  (the distance between the offset axis 81a  and  the   center  point   84b)   as   13,   and  a  distance   from  the offset  axis  81b  to a  center point  82b of  the  distal  end portion 82a   (the  distance  between  the  offset  axis   81a  and  the  center point   82b)   as  14,   the  relationship  between  the  distances  13, 14   is   set   to   13   
Fig. 1.9 is a top plan view of the fixed contact 86 which is supported on the base 51. The fixed contact 86 which is formed in an arcuate shape about a center point 86a is constituted of contacts H, I which are arranged on a concentric circle, and an annular contact J which is positioned concentrically inside the contacts H, I. In this embodiment a distance from the center point 8 6a to width centers of the contacts H, I is set to 14, while a distance from the center point 86a to a width center of the contact J is set to 13. By engaging the base 51 and the rotary 103 with each other, in a state that the offset axis 81b and the center point 86a are aligned with each other, the movable contact 8 0 is brought into contact   with   the   fixed   contact   86.<br>
[ 0 0 7 3]<br>
Fig.  20(a),   (b) ,   (c)  are respectively top plan views which show the  contact  relationship between  the  fixed contact  8 6  and the   movable    contact    80.       Symbols    which   are    equal    to    the previously-used  symbols  indicate  identical  or  similar  parts. Fig.   20(a)   shows  a  stand-down  state,   that  is,   a  state  in  which the  side  stand bar 2 0  is  rotated to the projecting position  (see Fig.  3)  .     Here,  a power  supply state  of  the  contact becomes  J-] and hence,   the  rotary  switch which  is  constituted of  the  fixed contact.  86  and the movable  contact  80  assumes  an OFF  state  and, at   the   same   time,   the   supply  of  power  from  the   ignition  unit 11    (see   Fig.    1)    is   prohibited.     Further,    Fig.    20(b)    shows   a neutral  state,   that  is,   a  state  in which  the  side  stand  bar  2 0 is  rotated no the predetermined intermediate position  (see Fig. 3)  .     Here,   the  power  supply  state  of  the  contact  becomes  J-I-H and  hence,    the   contacts   assume   an  ON  state  with  each  other Further,   Fig.   20(c)   shows  a  stand-up  state,   that   is,   a  state in which the side stand bar 20  is rotated to the storing position (see   Fig.    3).     Here,   the  power   supply  state   of   the   contacts becomes  J-H  and  hence,   the  rotary  switch  is  turned  on  and,   at. the   same   time,   the   supply  of  power   from  the   ignition  unit   l: is allowed.     By adopting the above-mentioned contact  structure having   the   offset   axis,    the   contact   contacting   portion   can perform an  offset  operation and hence,   it  is possible  to ensure a    large   power   supply   angle   while   ensuring   uniform   contact<br>
pressure. [0074]<br>
As has been explained above, according to the sand stand switch of the present invention, since the base and the rotary which constitute the side stand switch are made of resin, it is possible to make the side stand switch light-weighted. Further, the rotary and the rotary shaft as well as the rotary and the base are respectively engaged with each other by the respective engaging mechanisms, joining members such as mounting bolts become no more necessary thus enhancing the assembling property and., at the same time, the reduction of the number of parts and. the miniaturization of the whole side stand switch can be realized. Further, by setting shapes of the groove and the projection which constitute the engaging mechanism, it is possible to acquire the side stand switch which allows the easy mounting and dismounting of the parts on the vehicle side only when the side stand is rotated to the arbitrary position. In the above;-mentioned embodiment, the first to the third engaging mechanisms are formed of the convex and concave structure, the convex and the concave may be reversed. [0075]<br>
Here, it is needless to say that the shapes and the materials of the respective parts which form the switch unit, the constitution of the rotary switch and the like are no;; limited     to     the     above-mentioned     embodiments     and    various<br>
modifications are possible.     Further,  although the shaft of the side  stand  is  configured  to  be  integrally  rotatable  with  the side  stand bar  in the  above-mentioned embodiment,   the  shaft  of the   side   stand  may  be   fixed  to  the  bracket   side. [0076]<br>
Fig. 21 is a front view showing a switch unit 110 which is used as a side stand switch according to a second embodiment of the present invention and constitutional parts which are arranged in the vicinity of the switch unit 110. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. A side stand bar 20 of this embodiment is configured to be rotatable within a range of (approximately 110 degree from a projecting position indicated by a solid line in the drawing to a storing position 2 0a indicated by a double-dashed line at which the side stand bar 20 assumes an approximately horizontal posture . Further, in the drawing, as a predetermined intermediate position 2 0b between the projecting position and the storing position 2 0a, a position at which a center 2 9c of the hook pin 2 9 on the bracket 21 side a center 114c of a mounting small bolt 114 and a center 2 5c of a hook pin 2 5 are arrainged on one straight line, that is, a neutra.;. position is shown. [0077]<br>
A  fitting  hole  into  which  a  pivot  bolt  113   (see  Fig.   22; which  is  used, as  a  rotary shaft  is  fitted  is  formed  in a bracket<br>
21 formed of a plate member which is mounted on a main frame 4 , and a hook pin 2 9 is mounted on the bracket 21 in the vicinity of the fitting hole. Further, the side stand bar 20 made of metal or the like is substantially equal to the side stand bar shown in Fig. 2 and is configured such that a hook pin 2 5 and a pivot portion 26 which is formed in an approximately U shape so as to sandwich the bracket 21 are mounted on a rod-like body portion 2 3 which is bent in the direction toward the outside of the vehicle. [0078]<br>
The switch unit 110 is configured such that a rotary switch is housed in the inside of a base 111 made of a resin or the like , wherein an approximately-U-shaped engaging portion and a connector 112 are provided to one end portion of the base 111.     The  connector  112  is  configured  such  that  the  connector<br>
112	is  connected to one  end side  of  the wiring  cord  13   (see  Fig<br>
1)  thus allowing a signal  from the rotary switch to be outputted to   an   ::.gnition  unit   11.<br>
[0079]<br>
The switch unit 110 is positioned by allowing the hook pin 2 9 to be engaged with the approximately-U-shaped engaging portion thereof and, at the same time, is supported on the bracket  21   in  a  non-rotatable  manner  by  fastening  a  pivot  bolt;<br>
113	and  a  mounting  bolt   114.     To  the   contrary,   in  the   rotary<br>
switch  which  is  housed  in  the  base  111,   a  rotary   (see  Fig.   22)<br>
which is engaged with a pivot portion 2 6 is rotatably arranged. Due to -he integral, rotation of the rotary with the side stand bar 20, a switch output can be changed. Here, a spring 9 0 has a function of imparting a biasing force for stably holding the side stand bar 2 0 at the storing position or the projecting position by engaging upper and lower hook portions thereof with the hook pins 25, 29. [0080]<br>
F'ig. 22 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line K-K in Fig. 21. A connection between the bracket 21 and the side stand bar 20 is performed by allowing the pivot bolt 113 to penetrate the bracket 21 in a state that a U-shaped portion of the pivot portion 26 is engaged with the bracket 21 and by allowing a nut 91 to be threadedly engaiged with a threaded portion 113a which is formed on a distal end side of a body portion 113b. Further, as described above;, the switch unit 110 is mounted on the pivot portion 2 6 by allowing a mounting bolt: 114 on which a hexagonal head portion 114a and a flange portion 114b are formed to be threadedly engaged with a bolt hole 113c formed in the pivot bolt 113. The switch unit 110 is mainly constituted of the base 111 and a rotary 160 which is constituted by assembling an inner rotor 120 and an outer rotor 130, wherein the rotary 16 0 is rotatably supported with respect to the base 111. Here, the constitution which mounts the switch unit on the  pivot  bolt  using  the  mounting  bolt  is  substantially  equal*.<br>
to the constitution adopted by a conventional method used in general and hence, using the pivot bolt 113 as a common part, it is possible to mount either one of the switch unit 111) according to this embodiment and the switch unit of the conventional method in an arbitrarily selecting manner. [0081]<br>
On the outer rotor 13 0 of this embodiment, side engaging portions 131, 132 which extend to sandwich the pivot portion 2 6 from both sides are mounted. Further, on the outer rotor 130, a positioning projection 130a which is engaged with the inner rotor 120 is formed. Due to such a constitution, the outer-rotor 13 0 and the inner rotor 12 0 are integrally rotated along with the rotation of the side stand bar 2 0 . Further, along with the rotation of the side; stand bar 20 , a contact, position between a fixed contact 155 which is arranged on the base 111 and a movable contact 14 0 which is arranged on the inner rotor 12 0 is rotationally displaced thus changing the switch output. [0082]<br>
On the switch unit 110 of this embodiment, a first oil seal 115 and a second oil seal 116 which protect the rotary switcn from moisture and dusts and the like are mounted. The firsc oil seal 115 is arranged between an outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical portion 12 0a which extends downwardly from a center portion of the inner rotor 12 0 in the drawing and an inner peripheral   surface   Ilia  of  a  through  hole   formed  in  the  base<br>
Ill, wherein the first oil seal 115 has a function of providing hermetic sealing between the base 111 and the inner rotor 120 by fastening the mounting bolt 114. Further, the second oil seal 116 is arranged between the base 111 and the inner rotor 120 and is configured to prevent an intrusion of water or the like from the radially outside of the base 111. Here, the inner rotor 12 0 and the outer rotor 13 0 are formed as separate bodies from each other and. hence, the second oil seal 116 can be easily mounted between the inner rotor 12 0 and the outer rotor 13 0 without largely deforming the second oil seal 116 at the time of assembling. Further, at the time of assembling the switch unit 110, the second oil seal 116 is housed between the base 111 and the rotary 160, and one side surface of the outer rotor 130 is arranged to cover the second oil seal 116 and hence, it becomes difficult for moisture or the like to intrude into the vicinity of the second oil seal 116. Here, details of the movable contact 140 which is supported on the inner rotor 12 0 and the fixed contact 155 which is supported on the base 11L are described later. [0083]<br>
Fig.   23   is  a  perspective  view  of  the  switch  unit   110  of<br>
this      embodiment.	Symbols      which      are      equal       to      the<br>
previously-used  symbols  indicate  identical  or  similar  parts In  the  base  111,   a  through  hole  111b  into  which  a  cylindrical portion  120a  of  the  inner  rotor  120  is  inserted  is  formed,   and<br>
the first oil seal 115 is arranged between the inner peripheral surface Ilia and the cylindrical portion 12 0a. The movable contact 14 0 which is formed of an annular plate is configured such that the movable contact 14 0 is arranged on an upper surface side of the inner rotor 12 0 and is integrally rotated with the inner rotor 120. Here, the inner rotor 120, the outer rotor 130 and base 111 can be made of a resin or the like. [0084]<br>
Fig. 24 is a perspective view of a back surface side or the switch unit 110 of this embodiment. Symbols which are equai to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. As described above, on the outer rotor 13 0, the side engaging portions 131, 132 are formed. The engaging portions 131, 132 are configured such that inner surfaces 131a, 132a of the respective engaging portions 131, 132 are brought into contact: with both outer surfaces of the pivot portion 2 6 of the side stand bar 20. On a back surface side of the base 111, the fixed contact 155 which is brought into contact with the movable contact 140 at the time of assembling the switch unit 110 i.s arranged. 10 0 8 5]<br>
Fig. 25 to Fig. 27 show details of the movable contact: 140 of this embodiment. Fig. 2 5 is a front view (a) showing a front surface side of the movable contact: 140 which is brought: into  contact  with  the   fixed  contact   155  and  a   front  view   (b.<br>
showing  a  back  surface  side  of  the  movable  contact   140,   Fig. 26  is a cross-sectional view taken along a line L-L in Fig.  25(b), and  Fig.   27   is  a  cross-sectional  view  taken  along  a  line  M-M in   Fig..    25(b)    and   a   partially   enlarged   view   thereof.      The movable contact  14 0  is  formed of an annular plate made of metal. For    example,    the   movaible    contact.    140    may   be    obtained   by press-forming  copper  alloy.     According  to  the  movable  contact 140   of    this   embodiment,    it    is   possible   to   largely   reduce.1 operational man-hours  and a manufacturing cost  compared to  the constitution  which  uses   leaf   springs. [0086]<br>
A  body  portion   141   is   formed   in  a   state   that   the  body portion   141   includes   large   width   portions   in   the   vertical direction  in the drawing,  and contact  portions  142,   143  and  144 are   arranged  on  a   circle   14 6a  having  a  predetermined   radius<br>
about a contact center 146 at an equal interval of 120°. Further , the movable contact 140 is mounted on the inner rotor 120 such. that the center of rotation 147 is aligned with a rotary axis of the rotary 160. Due to such a constitution, the movable contact 14C is rotatable about the center of rotation 147 which. is offset from the center of contact 146 by a predetermined amount. With respect to distances from the center of rotation 14 7 to center points of the respective contacts, the distance from the center of rotation 147 to the center point 142a ana the  distance  from  the  center  of  rotation  14 7  to  a  center  point<br>
143a  are  equally  set  to  LI  and,   at  the  same  time,   the  distance from  the  center  of  rotation  147  to  a  center  point  144a  is  set to  L2,  wherein a relationship of  LI  
Further, positioning holes 145 are formed in the body portion 14 1 in a state that the positioning holes 145 are arranged   equidistantly   on   a   circle   having   a   predetermined<br>
radius  about  the  center  of  rotation  14 7  at  an  interval  of  12 0° and  a  mounting  position  of  the  body  portion   141  with  respect to  the  inner  rotor  12 0   is  determined  by  the  positioning  holes 145.     Here,   the  number  and  the  arrangement  of  the  positioning holes   are   not   limited  to  those  of   this   embodiment.     Further the positioning of the body portion 141 with respect to the inner rotor  120  may  be  performed  by  forming  engaging  projections  or the   like   on   the  movable   contact   140   side. [0088]<br>
The contact portions 142, 143 and 144 of the movable contact 14 0 of this embodiment are projecting portions which are formed on the body portion 141 at the time of performing the press forming of the body portion 141. On back surface sides of the contact projections 142, 143 and 144, recessed portions 142b, 143b and 144b which are formed in the body portion 14 1 along with the formation of the projecting portions are provided As  shown  in  Fig.   27(b) ,   the  recessed portion  is  deepest  at  the<br>
approximately rectangular contact portion which is brought into contact with the fixed contact,  while an approximately circular resiliently-repulsive-member  engaging  recessed  portion   144c is    formed   at   a   position   of   the   recessed   portion   which   is shallower than the contact portion by one stepped portion.     Here, the    recessed   portions    142b    and    143b    also    have    the    same constitution  as  the  recessed  portion  144b,   and  a  resiliently repulsive   member   which   is   formed   of   various   kinds   of   metal springs,       a       resin       or       the       like       is       stored       in       the resiliently-repulsive-member engaging recessed portions  142c, 143c  and  144c.     In  the  drawing,   a  state  that  a  coil  spring  1.64 (see       Fig.        29)        described       later       is       stored       in       the resiliently-repulsive-member   engaging   recessed  portion   14 4c is   shown. [0089]<br>
Here, the body portion 141 of the movable contact 140 may be configured to have a notch, a gap or the Like in a portion thereof without being continuously formed into an annular shape . Further, the respective contacts of the movable contact 14 0 may be constituted by welding contact members which are formed as separate bodies from the body portion 141 without being formed by press-forming. Further, in this embodiment, although the recessed portions 142b, 143b and 144b which include the resiliently-repulsive-member engaging recessed portions are formed  in  the  back  surface  side  of  the  contact  portions   142,<br>
143  and  144,   these  recessed  portions   142b,   143b  and  144b  may be   formed   at   positions   different   from   the   positions   of   the respective   contacts  of   the  movable   contact   140. [0090]<br>
The reason that the movable contact 14 0 of this embodiment is constituted as described above is that a large power supply angle can be ensured while making a contact pressure applied to the respective contacts of the rotary switch uniform over the whole circumference of the switch. For example, as shown in Fig. 10, with respect to the movable contact in which the plate-like spring contacts which respectively include arms having  different  lengths  from  each other  are  radially mounted<br>
on an approximately circular holder at an equal interval of 12 0° there exists a drawback that it is difficult to make the contact pressure of three spring contacts uniform. Further, in an attempt to make the contact pressure uniform by adjusting widths of the contact springs, it is necessary to enhance the forming accuracy of the spring contacts or to use high cost materials for enhancing the forming accuracy. [0091]<br>
On the other hand, it may be easy to make the contact pressure uniform when the lengths of the arms of the plate-like spring contacts are equal to each other. However, when a center point ^center of contact) of the respective contacts of the movable  contact  and  the;  center  of   rotation  which  constitutes<br>
an axis of the movable contact are aligned with each other, there-exists a drawback that the large power supply angle can not be ensured. Accordingly, as in the case of the rotary switch shown in Fig. 18 to Fig. 20, the technique which offsets the center of contact of the movable contact from the center of rotation of the movable contact is also adopted by to the second embodiment. Here, in conjunction with Fig. 31, the manner of operation of the movable contact when the center of contact of the movable contact is offset from the center of rotation of the movable contact is explained hereinafter. [00 92]<br>
In a schematic view shown in Fig. 31, a movable contact 180 is configured such that three contacts 181, 182 and 183 which are spaced apart from a contact center 184 with the same distance<br>
are arranged circumferentially at an equal interval of 12 0° On the other hand, a fixed contact 170 is constituted of a circular inner contact U and arc-shaped outer contacts S, r" which are arranged concentrically with respect to the inner contact: U. Further, the center of rotation of the movable contact 18C is configured so as to be aligned with a center point 171 of the fixed contact 170. As a result, the center of contact. 184 of the movable contact 180 is arranged to be offset from the center point 171 of the fixed contact 170. [0093]<br>
Fig.   31(a)   shows  a  stand-down  state,   that  is,   a  state  in<br>
which the side stand bar 20 is rotated to the projecting position (see Fig. 21). Here, a power supply state of the contacts becomes U-T and hence, the rotary switch which is constituted of the fixed contact 170 and the movable contact 180 assumes an OFF state. Fig. 31(b) shows a neutral state, that is, a state in which the side stand bar 2 0 is rotated to a predetermined intermediate position. Here, the power supply state of the contacts becomes U-T-S and hence, the contacts assume an ON state with each other. Further, Fig. 31(c) shows a stand-up state, that is, a state in which the side stand bar 20 is rotated to the storing position. Here, the power supply state of the contacts becomes U-S and hence, the rotary switch assumes an ON state. By adopting the above-mentioned contact structure having the offset axis, the contact contacting portions can perform an offset operation and hence, it is possible to ensure a large power supply angle while ensuring the uniform contact-pressure . [00 94]<br>
Fig. 2 8 is a perspective view of the movable contact and the rotary according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. In the center portion of ~he rotary 160 which is constituted of the inner rotor 120 and the outer rotor 130, a through hole 120b into which the. pivot  bolt.   113  penetrates  is   formed.     On  the  upper  surface  of<br>
the inner rotor 120, three engaging projections 121 which are engaged with positioning hole 145 formed in the movable contact; 140 are formed. Further, at positions of the movable contact 140 corresponding to the contact portions 142, 143 and 144 resilientiy-repulsive-member engaging holes 122, 123 and 124 are formed. [0095]<br>
Fig. 2 9 is a perspective view of the; movable contact and<br>
the base according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Symbols which are equal to the previously-used<br>
symbols     indicate     identical     or     similar    parts.	In     this<br>
embodiment, in the resilientiy-repulsive-member engaging recessed portions 142c, 143c and 144c which are formed in the back surface side of the movable contact 140, coil springs 162. 16 3 and 164 which are respectively used as resi liently repulsive members are stored. In assembling the switch unit 110, due to a resilien:; force of the resiliently repulsive members, the movable contact 140 is brought into contact with the fixed contact 155 which is arranged on the back surface side of the base 111 while ensuring the uniform contact pressure over the whole circumference thereof. Accordingly, even when the movable contact 140 is rotated repeatedly, it is possible to always realize a stable, power supply state between the movable contact 140 and the fixed contact 155. Here, the resiliently repulsive  members   is  not  limited  to  the  metal   spring  and  may<br>
be   formed  of  a  resin  or  the   like  having  the   resiliency. [00 96]<br>
Fig. 30(a) to Fig. 30(c) are top plan views showing the: relationship between the fixed contact 155 and the movable contact. 14 0 of the second embodiment of the present invention Symbols which are equal to the previously-used symbols indicate identical or similar parts. In this embodiment, the movable contact 140 is configured such that three contacts 142, 143 and 144 are spaced apart from the center of contact 184 with the; equal distance and are arranged circumferentially at an equal interval of 120°. On the other hand, the fixed contact 170 is constituted of a circular inner contact P and arc-shaped outer contacts Q, R which are arranged concentrically with respect to the inner contact P. Further, the center of rotation of the-movable contact 140 is configured to be aligned with the centei point 147 of the fixed contact 155. As a result, the centei of contact 146 of the movable contact 140 is arranged to be offset from the center of rotation (the center point 14 7) of the movable contact 140. Further, the distance from the center point 147 of the fixed contact 155 to the inner contact P is set to LI as described above, and the distances from the center point 147 of the fixed contact 155 to the outer contacts Q, R are set t;c L2 as described above. 10097]<br>
Fig.   30(a)   shows  a  stand-down  state,   that  is,   a  state  in<br>
which the side stand bar 2 0 is rotated to the projecting position (see   Fig.    21).     Here,    a   power   supply   state   of   the   contacts becomes  P-Q  and  hence,   the  rotary  switch  assumes  an  OFF  state and,   at  the   same  time,   the   supply  of  power   from  the   ignition unit  11   (see  Fig.   1)   is prohibited.     Fig.   30(b)   shows  a neutral state,  that  is,  a state  in which the  side stand bar 20  is rotated to the predetermined intermediate position  (see Fig.  21)  .     Here, the  power  supply state  of  the  contact  becomes  P-Q-R and hence, the  contacts  assume an ON state with each other.     Further,  Fig. 3 0 (c)   shows a  stand-up state,  that  is,  a state  in which the  side stand bar 20  is rotated to the storing position.     Here,  the power supply  state  of  the  contacts  becomes  P-R and hence,   the  rotary switch  assumes  an  ON  state  and,   at  the  same  time,   the  supply of  power   from  the   ignition  unit   11   is   allowed. [0098]<br>
As described above, according to the side stand switch of the second embodiment of the present invention, the side stand switch adopts the contact structure in which the center of contact of the movable contact is offset from the center of rotation of the movable contact and hence, it is possible to ensure the large power supply angle while making the contact pressure  which  is  applied  to  the  respective  contacts  uniform.<br>
