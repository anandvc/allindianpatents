The following specification describes the nature of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
Granted<br><br>
9/11/2007 <br><br><br>
An improved industrial process   for manufacture of Metoprolol<br>
base and salts thereof<br>
Technical Field of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved industrial process for manufacture of (3-blocker, antihypertensive compounds more particularly Metoprolol base and salts thereof.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Metoprolol and its salts such as tartrate and succinate are well established drugs having anti-hypertensive activity. These compounds acts as (3-blockers. The patients suffering from hypertension needs to be on treatment by these drugs for the whole lifetime. This kind of therapy necessitates that; the drugs are of high purity with very less impurity levels, so that the side effect is minimum. It also demands to produce these drugs at cheaper prices.<br>
Ample literature is available for producing metoprolol base and its salts, due to the significance of these compounds as anti hypertensive agents.<br>
Spanish patent ES 2011584 (equivalent US Patent 5082969) describes a process for metoprolol, where 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol and epichlorohydrin are reacted in aqueous alkaline conditions at 0° - 25°C temperature for 15-20 hours. The organic phase consisting of epoxide is separated, washed with water and used as such for reaction with large excess of isopropylamine in aqueous media like water at 0° - 30°C temperature.<br>
polish Patent PL 158497 describes a process wherein 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol and epichlorohydrin are reacted at 20° - 80°C temperature for 3 hours under aqueous alkaline conditions. The epoxide so formed is reacted with large excess of isopropyl amine<br><br><br>
(medium as well as reactant) to yield metoprolol base.<br>
Nearest prior art to the present invention is the form of US Patent 6252113, discloses reaction between 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol and epichlorohydrin in aqueous alkaline conditions at 50° - 70°C temperature for 1 hour. The resulting epoxide is distilled under high vacuum to improve quality. Pure epoxide then is treated with isopropylarnine in solvent such as isopropyl alcohol.<br>
As has been seen, lot of knowledge in the present field of invention is available; however, there remain some problems, which lead the scope for further investigations. It can be seen that almost all prior art have reactants per se same. Reactions which are carried out at .lower temperatures (below ambient) leads to slow rate of reaction with more impurity levels when the reaction at higher temperature range is carried out, the rate of reaction increased but required purification by distillation under high vacuum.<br>
In the processes where purification of epoxide is avoided, the resultant products are formed with higher impurities. The processes involving excess use of isopropyl amine leads to increased costs. The products formed with higher impurity levels necessitate extra purifications, which enhances the costs.<br>
Therefore, it is of importance to develop a process for manufacture of metoprolol base, vhich is economical, eco-friendly and yielding high quality with higher yields, which also avoids the operations like high vacuum distillation.<br>
The patients suffering from hypertension needs to be on treatment by these drugs for the whole lifetime. This kind of therapy necessitates that; the drugs are of high purity with very less impurity levels, so that the side effects are minimum. It also demands to produce these drugs at cheaper prices.<br><br><br>
Objectives:<br>
The objective of the present invention is to develop a process for manufacture of Metoprolol base and salts thereof, in high yields with higher purity and better operator friendlyoperations at cheaper prices.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved industrial process for manufacture of P-blocker, antihypertensive compounds more particularly Metoprolol base and salts thereof.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
The present invention has made possible to produce metoprolol base and its salts in higher yields with high purity and avoiding processes like high vacuum distillation at cheaper costs.<br>
The present invention involves optimization of reaction temperatures, molar ratio of reactants in order to achieve higher purity and yields by avoiding purification of epoxide intermediates.<br>
The present invention process involves three steps. In the first step is for preparation of epoxide by reacting 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol with epichlorohydrin in an aqueous media containing inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide at 40-45°C temperature.<br>
The resultant epoxide is used in the second step for preparation of metoprolol base. The<br>
epoxide is treated with isoproplyamine in aqueous media to obtain Metoprolol base of<br>
high purity in high yields. The last step is converting metoprolol base into the succinate<br>
and tartrate salts by reacting with acids like succinic acid or tartaric acid in solvent	media<br>
such as acetone.<br><br><br>
By following the present invention as described below, it has been made possible to produce metoprolol base and its salts in higher yields with high purity and avoiding processes like high vacuum distillation, at cheaper costs.<br>
The present invention involves optimization of reaction temperatures, molar ratio of reactants in order to achieve higher purity and yields by avoiding purification of epoxide intermediates.<br>
It involves three steps :<br>
Step-1 : Epoxide formation by reacting 2-(methoxyethyl) phenol with epichlorohydrin. Step-2 : Metoprolol base from reaction of epoxide with isopropyl amine. Step- 3 : Metoprolol salts from metoprolol, base<br>
The process of the present invention is illustrated by the following example.<br>
Step-1 : Epoxide formation :<br>
4 (2-methoxyethyl) phenol and epichlorohydrin are reacted in aqueous media like water,     in presence of inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, at temperature range of 40° -45°C in 3 to 5 hours time.<br>
The molar ratio of 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol to epichlorohydrin used in the range of 1 : 0.92 to 1 : 2.0, wherein the more preferred ratio is 1 : 1.1 to 1 : 1.4 and the most preferred ratio is 1 : 1.31.<br>
Most preferred concentration of sodium hydroxide in water is 25% w/v<br>
 Preferred molar ratio of sodium hydroxide to 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol used is 1.14 0.95, more preferred is 1.024 : 1 and the most preferred ratio is 1.136 : 1<br><br><br>
Reaction is carried out in the temperature range of 10° to 45°C, where in most preferred is 40° to 45°C.<br>
Most preferred ratio of 4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenol : water is 1: 1.6 volumes.<br>
At the end of reaction, aqueous and organic phases are separated.out.<br>
The organic phase is washed thrice by water. The pH of washing must be in the range of 7 to 8. This pH range is necessary to achieve high purity of the epoxide.<br>
Traces of water are removed from organic phase by distillation under vacuum below 55°C temperature. Keep the residue at 55oC under vacuum for 3 to 5 hours, till the purity of sample is achieved in the,range-of 96 98%<br>
The yield of the epoxide, so obtained is in the range of 93-95% of stoicheometric and purity 97-99%.<br>
The epoxide with above purity is used for making metoprolol base.<br>
Step-2 : Metoprolol base<br>
The epoxide and isopropyl amine are reacted in aqueous media like water at temperature 0° - 30°C.<br>
Preferred temperature during addition of epoxide is 10° to 25°C, while the most preferred temperature for completion of reaction is 30°C<br>
Reaction completes in 3 hours time at 30°C.<br>
Preferred molar ratio of epoxide : isopropyl amine is 1 : 5.0-5.5 where in the most preferred ratio is 1 :5.2 5.3<br><br><br>
Ratio of water to epoxide is 2 : 1 vol. : wt.<br>
On completion of reaction, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0° - 5°C.<br>
In order to achieve high purity it is necessary to maintain above temperature range; Formation of impurity at_RRT 0.35 (By GC) is minimized by operating at 0° - 5°C. It is observed that in cases temperature rises above the range, this impurity increases.<br>
The reaction mass is quenched by 2.2 volume of water. The product is extracted by 3 volumes of toluene. The toluene layer is washed three times by water for removal of isopropyl amine content is less than 0.5%.<br>
Traces of isopropyl amine are removed by maintaining under vacuum below temperatures 25°C. It is necessary to eliminate traces of isopropyl amine at low temperature below 25°C, as the presence of isopropyl amine during distillation of toluene above 25°C leads to the formation of an impurity_at RRT 1.54 by (GO. Following the present invention process this impurity formation is avoided.<br>
In case when isopropyl amine remained in the traces, the impurity at RRT 1.54 (by GC) is detected.<br>
Thus, following process as per present invention, formation of the impurities at RRT 0.35 &amp; RRT 1.54 are under control, which leads to yield highly pure Metoprolol base in higher yields.<br>
The analysis of sample of toluene layer shows absence of isopropyl amine. Toluene is distilled out at temperature 30° 40oC under-vacuum.<br>
The residue of metoprolol base so obtained shows purity more than 99% and the yield of which is in range of 88 to 89%). (Stoicheometric)<br><br>
Step- 3 : Metoprolol salts from metoprolol base<br>
Metoprolol succinate :<br>
Metoprolol base was converted to Metoprolol succinate, by reacting with succinic acid. The metoprolol base was dissolved in solvent such as acetone, at the temperature of 45±2oC. The succinic acid -used-in solution form the solution of succinic acid was prepared by refluxing in acetone. The succinic acid was used in stoichiometric proportion of 2 moles : 1 mole of metoprolol base.<br>
The solution of succinic acid was added to the solution of metoprolol base. After mixing of the solution, pH of the reaction mass was adjusted 7.1..to.7.3_The reaction was carried out by refluxing for 4-5 hours. Then reaction mass was cooled to the temperature of 25±2°C and stirred at the temperature, followed by filtration. The metoprolol succinate so obtained was purified by crystallization from methanol<br>
Metoprolol succinate obtained with the yield of 72-75% (stoichiometric) having purity of more than 99.8% by HPLC and any other impurity less then 0.1%.<br><br>
    Metoprolol tartrate :<br>
The metoprolol base was reacted with tartaric acid to obtain metoprolol tartrate salt. Metoprolol base was dissolved in suitable solvent such as acetone, at the temperature of 45±2°C. Tartaric acid was dissolved in solvent like acetone under refluxing conditions. The tartaric acid used in the molar ratio of 1 : 2 moles of metoprolol base. The solution of tartaric acid was added to the solution of metoprolol base and the pH was adjusted between 6.1 to 6.3<br>
Reaction was refluxed for 4 hours for completion of salt formation, then cooled and stirred at 25±2°C for 2 hours. Metoprolol teprolol tartrate was obtained by filtration, which was then purified by crystallization from solvent like isopropanol.   The metorprolol tartrate<br><br>
obtained in the yield of 72-73% (stoichiometric) with purity of more than 99.8% and any other single impurity NMT 0.1%<br>
