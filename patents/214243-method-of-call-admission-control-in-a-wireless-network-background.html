Background<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to wireless wide area networks and, more particularly, to<br>
call admission control in such networks.<br>
Discussion of Related Art<br>
	Subscribers are adopting wireless communications in increasingly large<br>
numbers. Wireless wide area networks service such calls via Mobile Switching<br>
Centers (MSC's), other switches, and other components.<br>
	To keep the MSCs and other switches from getting overloaded, the<br>
admission of new calls is controlled via a process known as "Call Admission<br>
Control." In this fashion, some guarantee on call processing delay can be given<br>
to a very large percentage of the calls processed by the switch. For example, a<br>
quality of service (QoS) metric may be established (e.g., calls will suffer less<br>
than 200 ms of call, setup latency), and through the control of new calls, the QoS<br>
metric can be guaranteed for call setups in progress. Call admission control<br>
involves reducing (or throttling) the call arrival. In short, with call admission<br>
control some calls are dropped before processing rather than potentially<br>
saturating the system by attempting to handle the call.<br>
	A conservative call admission control policy can prevent the switch<br>
from getting overloaded but at the expense of throughput. An aggressive call<br>
admission control policy can increase the throughput but may be unable to meet<br>
the QoS metric (as a consequence of not detecting congestion fast enough).<br>
	In a distributed system, throttling can be implemented in multiple ways<br>
based on the ability of the peer entity and the communication protocol among<br>
the entities. For example, the peer entity may be capable of receiving explicit<br>
feedback through the control/signaling protocol to reduce the call rate or the<br>
peer entity may have to implicitly inter from expired timers for calls that were<br>
not responded to by the switch. Some systems may effectively look at the most<br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
2<br>
utilized component (i.e., the closest to being saturated) and throttle the calls<br>
accordingly.<br>
	To control call admissions, software logic is typically used to determine<br>
when the number of calls arriving into the switch or MSG is in danger of<br>
saturating the switch. The call admission control logic will "drop calls" to<br>
prevent such saturation. To date, many call admission control policies have<br>
been ad hoc, There ia a need in the art for an improved method and system for<br>
controlling call admissions to the network.<br>
Summary<br>
	The invention provides methods and systems for providing fine grain.<br>
call admission contral into a communication network.<br>
	According to one aspect of the invention, the fine grain control<br>
maximizes the aggregate revenue for the service provider.<br>
	According to another aspect of the invention, an allocatable call<br>
admission budget for the communication network is obtained. A set of call<br>
classes for the communication network, are identified in which each class has a<br>
corresponding call arrival rate, revenue and cost. Pot each call class a<br>
corresponding profitability metric is determined. A corresponding throttling<br>
fraction is determined for each call class in which the throttling fraction is a<br>
function of the profitability metric and the allocatable call admission budget.<br>
The throttling fractions for each class are provided to a call admission control<br>
server to throttle calls for each class accordingly.<br>
	Under another aspect of the invention, the call arrival rate is a historical<br>
metric.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
	Preferred embodiments of the invention provide a method and system<br>
for controlling call admissions to a switch in a wireless wide area network using<br>
fine grain control. Under certain embodiments, the calls are characterized<br>
according to classes, and each class has a corresponding metric to be optimized.<br>
For example, the metric may be revenue to the service provider, or it may be a<br>
ratio of revenue to cost of servicing such a class of call (i.e., profitability<br>
metric). Optimal throttling rates for each class of calls may be calculated<br>
accordingly to thus provide improved revenue to the service provider. Under<br>
one preferred embodiment, throttling fractions are determined based on the<br>
arrival rates ÔÅ¨i of the corresponding classes of calls, the metric to be optimized r,<br>
and the processing cost S of the call. These parameters are considered in view<br>
of an upper bound of utilization-a level which if exceeded may result in<br>
saturation of the switch or which may hinder satisfaction of QoS guarantees.<br>
The throttling fractions are then used by the call admission control logic to<br>
throttle calls according to their class.<br>
	Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary wireless wide, area network in which<br>
embodiments of the invention may be realized. The specific example of figure 1<br>
is a simplified 3G network in accordance with the CDMA 2000 proposal, but<br>
persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be realized in<br>
any telecommunication network utilizing call admission control policies.<br>
	In the exemplary network, mobile stations 102 communicate over an air<br>
interface 103 with a radio access network (RAN) 104. The RAN 104 includes<br>
Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) 106 that are in radio contact with the mobile<br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
4<br>
station and that are in fixed line communication with a Base Station Controller<br>
(BSC) 108. The BSC 108 controls the radio equipment used to communicate<br>
with the mobile stations. This function is collectively referred to as Radio<br>
Resource Management, and it encompasses the management of handoffs of the<br>
roaming mobile stations 102 within a BSC and the allocation of radio channels<br>
for both voice and data traffic.<br>
	The RAN 104 communicates with a Packet Data Serving Node (PSDN)<br>
116 which in turn communicates with IP Backbone 118.<br>
	The BSC communicates with a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 112,<br>
which is a standard Local End Office with enhanced call processing software<br>
(including mobility management) and (optional) hardware that can perform<br>
transcoding and rate adaptation functions. For example, certain embodiments of<br>
the invention may use the MSC described in U.S. Pat Appl. Ser. No.<br>
09/721,329 filed on Nov. 22, 2000 (which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety) and assigned to the assignees of the present invention with the<br>
modifications described herein. Likewise, other MSCs may be used with the<br>
modifications described herein.<br>
	Typically, signaling information between the BSC and the MSC is<br>
conveyed in accordance with a predefined protocol, and voice/data is conveyed<br>
over bearer circuits in accordance with other protocols. Among other things, the<br>
MSC 112 provides mobility management functionality. This function consists<br>
of manage meat of mobile station parameters such as the location of a mobile<br>
station, mobile identity and authentication. Handoffs between BSCs and<br>
between MSCT8 are controlled by the MSC. The MSC communicates with the<br>
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 114 using known signaling and<br>
bearer circuit protocols.<br>
	The Mobile Switching Center (MSC) receives call setup requests from<br>
mobile users via the RAN and incoming call requests from other PSTN<br>
endpoints to mobile users. The actual signaling interfaces and the associated<br>
signaling protocols depend on the specific network topology. For example in a<br>
CDMA 2000 network, outgoing calls from mobile subscribers in a MSC area<br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
5<br>
arrives at the MSC through the IOS/IS-634 signaling interface from the RAN,<br>
whereas incoming calls from the PSTN arrive through ISUP protocol. In next<br>
generation systems, call set-up requests may also arrive at the MSC from the<br>
PDSN originating from either IP-enabled handsets or newer generation RANs<br>
that generate IP traffic (both signaling and bearer). The specific computing task<br>
performed by the MSC depends on the signaling protocol, call type,<br>
caller/callee information etc. The aggregate computational resource usage of the<br>
MSC depends on the call arrival rates at each signaling interface.<br>
	Figure 2 shows a simplified architectural diagram of select internal<br>
software modules of an exemplary MSC 112, The simplified diagram is used to<br>
help illustrate the numerous types of call arrivals that axe handled by a switch<br>
112 and that are a potential source of saturation of the switch.<br>
	The architecture includes an IP Message Handler (IPMH) 208, which<br>
handles messages from a PDSN or a new generation RAN that generates IP<br>
traffic, a SS7 Message Handler 210 which handles SS7 messages from<br>
BSC/RAN 104, a Communications Session Manager (CSM, more below) 202, a<br>
Visitor Location Register (VLR) 206, a Media Gateway (MGW) control process<br>
204, and call admission control (CAC) server 212,<br>
	The IPMH 208 and SS7 Message Handier 210 each handle messages<br>
from their associated links under the control of the CSM 202 and CAC Server<br>
212. In relevant part, the CAC Server sends control messages via software<br>
communication channels 214, 216 to instruct the message handlers about<br>
various throttling rates for specific classes of calls. The message handiers in<br>
turn throttie incoming calls accordingly, For example, if the IPMH 208 were<br>
instructed to throttle 20% of calls of a certain class, under certain embodiments<br>
the IPMH would randomly throttle 20% of such calls by effectively preventing<br>
such calls to be "set-up" or established. The message handlers also use the<br>
communication channels 214, 216 to convey various forms of statistical<br>
information to the CAC Server 212.<br>
	The CSM 202 terminates the- signaling protocols and performs the<br>
session and mobility management functions. To do so, the CSM communicates<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
6<br>
to the message handlers 208, 210, the VLR 206, and the MGW via<br>
communication channels 218, 220, 222, and 224.<br>
	The VLR 206 performs subscriber record lookups for all active<br>
subscribers at the MSC 112.<br>
	The MGW control process 204 sends commands to the media gateway<br>
that control the termination and switching of the actual bearer (voice/data)<br>
traffic.<br>
	The CAC Server 212, in relevant part, is responsible for call admission<br>
control of the system. The CAC Server, of certain embodiments, is implemented<br>
as a module as part of an Operations, Administration, Management, and<br>
Provisioning system (OAM&amp;P, more below). It includes logic (more below) to<br>
compute throttle functions in an efficient way. The throttle functions are used to<br>
control che throttling for a next measurement window (which may be controlled<br>
in a variety of ways, e.g., periodically or only when certain thresholds are<br>
reached). The throttle functions (or values) are conveyed to the message<br>
handlers, e.g., IIPMH 208, so that they may actually perform such throttling. As<br>
explained below, the throttling functions may be associated with classes of calls<br>
that the message handlers may discriminate. Under certain embodiments, the<br>
throttling functions are determined via an optimization procedure such as one to<br>
optimize a profitability metric for the system. Other methods of determining<br>
throttling functions may also be used, which might provide improvements to<br>
such metrics, but perhaps sub-optimally. Under certain embodiments, the CAC<br>
Server collects various statistics from the message handlers and the CSM via<br>
channels 214, 216 and 226. The CAC Server may also implement smoothing<br>
logic (more below) to determine certain relevant statistics such as smoothed<br>
arrival rates of various classes of calls.<br>
	Figure 3 shows an exemplary switch architecture including select<br>
hardware components and illustrating the layered nature of an exemplary<br>
software architecture. In this instance, call admission control logic is<br>
implemented in a call admission control server 302, which is part of a network<br>
management server 300, The CAC server 302 obtains event detail records from<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
7<br>
an Event Collector 304 in the network management server 300. The Event<br>
Collector receives event detail records from the individual hardware modules of<br>
the switch 112, and in this fashion may collect various forma of statistics. For<br>
example, as illustrated, the CAC Server may collect statistics, for example, from<br>
the SS7 signaling module 210 and the CSM module 202. The network<br>
management server also accepts network configuration parameters and certain<br>
of these may be conveyed to the CAC Server 302. For example, under certain<br>
embodiments, an upper bound UB of switch utilization may be provided by an<br>
administrator. The utilization in turn may be a form of measure or calculation of<br>
various monitored performance statistics, e.g., memory and CPU utilization at<br>
the switch, queue length and delay, etc.<br>
	The CAC server 302 enforces throttling comral through a Policy<br>
Interface 306 exposed by the OAM&amp;P system 308. For example, the CAC<br>
Server may calculate various throttling functions for various classes of calls and<br>
convey such to the appropriate message handlers and modules, e.g., IPMH 208<br>
SS7 MH 210. Thereafter, the message handlers may analyze each incoming call<br>
to determine its corresponding class and subject it to its throttling logic, e.g.,<br>
dropping certain fractions of calls in some way, e.g., weighted random<br>
dropping.<br>
	For example, for a given throttling fraction ÔÅ¥i1, where 'i' is the class of<br>
call, the throttling logic within the CAC Server will calculate or determine a<br>
corresponding function and will instruct the appropriate message handler to<br>
permit only that fraction of calls for that class to be admitted. The message<br>
handler will drop other calls within the corresponding time window (i.e., the<br>
intervening time before a subsequent control message is received by the<br>
message handler).<br>
	One embodiment of the logic uses the following parameters to determine<br>
corresponding throttling values:<br>
		‚Ä¢ P is the number of revenue classes in consideration<br>
		‚Ä¢ t is the throttle value associated with class i and by definition is<br>
greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one.<br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
8<br>
		‚Ä¢ li is a smoothed estimate of the arrival rate for calls of class i<br>
(more below<br>
		regarding smoothing)<br>
		‚Ä¢ t, is the revenue per call associated with class i<br>
		‚Ä¢ St is the cpu time required (or more generically the "cost") to set<br>
up calls of type i<br>
		‚Ä¢ UB is an upper bound on the utilization of the switch, which<br>
preferably should not be exceeded, to honor QoS delay requirements on call<br>
setup<br>
	The total revenue generated over all the classes P of calls may be<br>
represented with the following equation, Consequently, maximizing, the<br>
following equation maximizes revenue.<br><br>
	However, though service providers will desire to maximize the above<br>
revenue equation, they should maintain the following constraint to satisfy QoS.<br>
The constraint effectively states that the cost on the system should be less than<br>
the pre-established upper bound (UB).<br><br>
	One efficient way to solve the above is to transform the throttling<br>
variable with a new variable, Specifically, by defining a new, transform variable<br>
tÔÄ± * according to the following equation<br><br>
and substituting tÔÄ± * into the total revenue equation, the maximization problem<br>
may be restated as follows:<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
9<br>
subject to the constraints that:<br><br>
	Various values for ti * may then be found by solving the system of<br>
equations, and the ti * may transformed back to ti , which may then be used in<br>
control messages to the message handlers, as outlined above.<br>
	Figure 4 is a flow chart showing exemplary logic for solving ti *<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The logic starts in 400 and<br>
proceeds to 405 in which the metric being optimized (e.g., revenue, ti) is<br>
divided by its corresponding cost Si, for each class. In 410 the ratios are ranked<br>
in descending order. When the metric r is revenue, the ratios and descending<br>
order correspond to a tanking of corresponding revenue per unit cost for each<br>
class.<br>
	In 415, a check is made to determine whether the t* have been<br>
determined for all classes, If they have the logic ends in 499. Until the last class<br>
(with the lowest ratio) is analyzed to determine its corresponding t* , the logic<br>
will flow through the "No" branch and proceed to 420. In 420, the following<br>
equation is solved for the current class i1 being considered;<br><br>
	If one thinks of UB as the budget that may be allocated, this equation<br>
effectively determines if the budget allows the current class to be fully serviced,<br>
in which case the class i will have its ÔÅ¥* allocated its corresponding ÔÅ¨iSi;. But, if<br>
the full amount needed to serve the class being considered cannot be granted,<br>
then the allocation gives the class as much of the resources as remains (j,e., the<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
10<br>
upper bound minus the summation of all previously allocated t*).<br>
	In 425, the t* are transformed back to t values which may then be<br>
utilized by the call admission control logic 302 to instruct corresponding<br>
message handlers accordingly. The logic then loops back to 415 to consider the<br>
next class in the metric per unit of cost order.<br>
	In this embodiment, the call access control policy imposes one QoS<br>
constraint on all classes of calls. The estimated throttling factors are also non-<br>
preemptive and static. In alternate embodiments, it is possible to add utilization<br>
constraints specific to each call type. It is also possible to implement dynamic<br>
throttling with call preemption. By doing this, lower revenue producing calls in<br>
progress can be preferentially dropped for higher revenue producing calls under<br>
a utilization bound restriction.<br>
	In some embodiments, it may be preferable to use a statistically<br>
smoothed call arrival rate for the various l. Figure 5 illustrates call arrival<br>
measurement windows used for determining throttling values in certain<br>
embodiments. The length of the measurement windows should be long enough<br>
to represent a reasonably good statistical sampling period, l(c) is the call arrival<br>
rate at the current arrival window. In order to avoid false alarms or missed<br>
congestion, it is imperative to smooth the call arrival rate by taking into account<br>
the current arrival rate and the arrival rates of past measurement windows. In<br>
this case,l(rc) represents the smoothed arrival rate of the current window and<br>
l (sp) represents the smoothed arrival rate of the past arrival window.<br>
	The smoothed arrival rate of the current window is modeled by the<br>
equation:<br><br>
where wc and wp represent the weighing factors for the current and past<br>
windows and should add to 1. The weights may be set and re-established by the<br>
system. For example, wc may be set to 0.8 and wp may be set to 0.2. Of course,<br>
other forms of exponential smoothing may be employed In addition the call<br>
arrival rates may be based on historical statistics. For example, Che rates may be<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
11<br>
set to correspond with the time of day or the time of year.<br>
	At end of current window, the smoothed arrival rate of the past window<br>
should be approximately equal the arrival rate of the current window as<br>
modeled:<br>
	Thus, using the above approach and assuming that the optimizable<br>
metric is revenue, calls from a class having higher revenue per unit cost may be<br>
throttled differently than calls from a class with lower revenue per unit cost.<br>
Also, since cost is factored into the analysis, it may not be the case that calls<br>
with simply the highest revenue are prioritized.<br>
	Analogously, the call throttling may consider other criteria such as<br>
priority. For example, emergency calls may have special throttling procedures<br>
to allow the calls through. As an example of revenue classes, consider two types<br>
of customers: Type 1 customer has a monthly flat subscription fee and is<br>
allowed "unlimited" number of calls during the month. Thus the per call<br>
revenue for the service provider is 0, since the call is free. Type 2 customer is<br>
not a member of this flat fee and pays a premium revenue on a per call basis.<br>
	One of the main aspects of the above embodiments is the formulation of<br>
the "revenue-based" call admission control as a linear programming problem<br>
(LP). The decision variables of the LP are the throttle values for the various<br>
revenue classes. Another key aspect of the above embodiments is the simple<br>
linear algorithm to determine the "optimal" solutions to the LP.<br>
Traditionally LPs are solved using algorithms that are high degree polynomials<br>
in computational complexity. In several described embodiments, however, such<br>
computational complexity is avoided, thus reducing load and enhancing<br>
efficiency of the MSC or switch.<br>
	At certain points in the description above, logic was described which<br>
created a throttling function. This terminology was used to show that the actual<br>
determination of a throttling value may be distributed in many ways. For<br>
example, the CAC Server may have logic to partially or fully determine the<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
12<br>
value. In the former case, the final determination may be made by a<br>
corresponding message handler.<br>
	The above embodiments provided throttling fractions in various ways.<br>
One preferred embodiment, for example, calculated optimal, or near optimal<br>
values, using a linear programming approach. Alternative embodiments<br>
however may provide throttling fractions in other ways. For example, throttling<br>
fractions may be provided by a look-up table in which all or a subset of the<br>
above parameters, e.g., arrival rates, and class, may be indices into the table or<br>
other data structure.<br>
	It will be further appreciated that the scope of the present invention is<br>
not limited to the above-described embodiments, but rather is defined by the<br>
appended claims, and that these claims will encompass modifications of and<br>
improvements to what has been described.<br>
What is claimed is:<br><br>
WO 2004/053643 							PCT/US2003/038865<br>
13<br>
1. A method of controlling call admissions in a communication network,<br>
comprising:<br>
	obtaining an allocatable call admission budget for the communication<br>
network;<br>
	identifying a set of call classes for the communication network, wherein<br>
each class has a corresponding call arrival rate, revenue, and cost<br>
	for each call class determining a corresponding profitability metric,<br>
	assigning a corresponding throttling fraction for each call class wherein<br>
the throttling fraction is a function of the profitability metric and the allocatable<br>
call admission budget;<br>
	providing the throttling fraction for each class to a call admission control<br>
server to throttle calls for each class accordingly.<br>
2 , The method of claim 1 wherein unallocated call admission budget is defined<br>
as the allocatable call admission budget minus the transformed throttling<br>
fraction of any class for which a transformed throttling fraction has been<br>
assigned, and wherein in descending order starting from the class having the<br>
highest profitability metric and proceeding through the class with the lowest<br>
profitability metric, the transformed throttling fraction for each class is<br>
determined as the minimum of unallocated call admission budget and the<br>
product of the call arrival rate and cost for the corresponding class.<br>
3. The method of claim 1 wherein each call class has a corresponding revenue<br>
metric per call and the profitability metric is the revenue metric divided by the<br>
corresponding cost.<br>
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the call arrival rate is a smoothed average<br>
call arrival rate.<br>
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the call arrival rate is a historical metric.<br><br>
WO 2004/053643							 PCT/US2003/038865<br>
14<br>
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the act of assigning a corresponding throttling<br>
fraction tÔÄ± for each call class i includes the acts of<br>
	modeling the allocation of resources as a linear programming problem,<br>
in which, the throttling fractions ti for each call class i are decision, variables of<br>
the linear programming problem, and wherein the linear programming problem<br>
is solved by transforming the throttling fractions to a transformed throttling<br>
fraction ti" according to the equation<br><br>
wherein li is an estimate of a call arrival rate for class i and Si is an estimate of<br>
cost to service a call in class i.<br><br>
Methods and system for providing line grain call admission control network a communication network are disclosed.<br>
Under some embodiments, the fine grant control methodizes proxibility of coll serviced by the network oil a call class basis.<br></td>
