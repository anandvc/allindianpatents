				<td>A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING AN AUDIO SIGNAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for processing a signal and<br>
method thereof. Although the present invention is suitable for a wide scope of<br>
applications, it is particularly suitable for encoding and decoding audio signals using<br>
spectral data of signal.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, in processing an audio signal using signal characteristics, the audio<br>
signal is processed based on characteristics between signals from different bands.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
Conventional art is insufficient to process an audio signal effectively based on<br>
characteristics between signals from different bands.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for processing a signal and<br>
method thereof that substantially obviate one or more of the problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for processing a<br>
signal and method thereof, by which an audio signal can be processed based on<br>
characteristics between signals from different bands.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for<br>
processing a signal and method thereof, by which spectral data on a different band<br>
can be obtained in a manner of selecting appropriate spectral data from a plurality of<br>
spectral data of a specific band.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for<br>
processing a signal and method thereof, by which a bitrate can be minimized despite<br>
processing such a signal having a different characteristic as a speech signal, an audio<br>
signal and the like by a scheme appropriate for the corresponding characteristic.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
The present invention provides the following effects or advantages.<br>
First, the present invention decodes a signal having a speech signal<br>
characteristic as a speech signal and decodes a signal having an audio signal<br>
characteristic as an audio signal. Therefore, the present invention can adaptively select<br>
a decoding scheme that matches each signal characteristic.<br>
Secondly, the present invention obtains spectral data of a different band by<br>
selecting the most appropriate spectral data from transferred spectral data, thereby<br>
increasing a reconstruction rate of an audio signal.<br>
Thirdly, the present invention selects spectral data using start band<br>
information transferred from an encoder. Therefore, the present invention increases<br>
accuracy in selecting spectral data but decreases complexity required for carrying out<br>
an operation.<br>
Fourthly, the present invention omits a transfer of spectral data corresponding<br>
to a partial band, thereby reducing bits required for a spectral data transfer<br>
considerably.<br>

BEST MODE<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the<br>
description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may<br>
be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the<br>
invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the<br>
written description and claims thereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, a signal processing<br>
apparatus according to the present invention includes a copy band determining unit,<br>
a band extension information receiving unit and a target band generating unit. And,<br>
the target band generating unit includes a time dilatation/compression unit and a<br>
decimation unit. Moreover, the target band generating unit can further include a<br>
filtering unit.<br>
The copy band determining unit receives spectral data corresponding to a<br>
low frequency band in a frequency band including the low frequency band and a high<br>
frequency band. The copy band determining unit then determines a copy band based<br>
on frequency information of the copy band corresponding to a partial band of the low<br>
frequency band.<br>
The band extension information obtaining unit obtains side information for<br>
generating a target band from the copy band. In this case, the side information can be<br>
obtained from a bitstream and can include gain information, harmonic information<br>
and the like.<br>
The target information generating unit generates spectral data of a target<br>
band corresponding to the high frequency band using the spectral data of the copy<br>
band. In this case, the copy band can exist above the low frequency band. It is able to<br>
generate the high frequency band using the copy band existing on the low frequency<br>
band. In the same way, it is also possible to generate the low frequency band using<br>
the copy band existing on the high frequency band.<br>
The target band generating unit includes the time dilatation/compression<br>
unit and the decimation unit and is able to further include the filtering unit. In<br>
particular, the copy band can be obtained from the bitstream or can be obtained by<br>
filtering the received spectral data.<br>
In this case, frequency information of the copy band indicates at least one of a<br>
start frequency, a start band and index information indicating the start band. And, the<br>
spectral data of the target band can be generated using at least one of gain information<br>
corresponding to a gain between the spectral data of the copy band and the spectral<br>
data of the target band, and harmonic information of the copy band. The spectral data<br>
of the low frequency band can be decoded by one of the audio signal and the speech<br>
signal.<br>
The present invention is applicable to core coding of AAC, AC3, AMR and the<br>
like or future core coding. The following descriptions mainly refer applications on<br>
downmix signal but are not limited.<br>
It is understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide<br>
further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
MODE FOR INVENTION<br>
Reference is made to the preferred embodiments of the present invention in<br>
detail, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Terminologies in the present invention can be construed as the following<br>
references. Terminologies not disclosed in this specification can be construed as<br>
concepts matching the idea of the present invention. It is understood that 'coding' can<br>
be construed both as encoding or decoding in a specific case. 'Information' in this<br>
disclosure can generally mean values, parameters, coefficients, elements and the like<br>
and its meaning can be construed as different occasionally, by which the present<br>
invention is not limited.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an audio signal encoding apparatus according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of a<br>
partial band encoding unit shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an audio signal encoding apparatus according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a multi-channel encoding unit 110, a<br>
partial band encoding unit 120, an audio signal encoding unit 130, a speech signal<br>
encoding unit 140 and a multiplexer 150.<br>
The multi-channel encoding unit 110 receives a plurality of channel signals<br>
(hereinafter named a multi-channel signal) and then generates a downmix signal by<br>
downmixing the multi-channel signal. The multi-channel encoding unit 110 generates<br>
spatial information required for upmixing the downmix signal to the multi-channel<br>
signal. In this case, the spatial information can include channel level difference<br>
information, inter-channel correlation information, channel prediction coefficient and<br>
downmix gain information and the like.<br>
Meanwhile, this downmix signal can include a signal in a time-domain (e.g.,<br>
residual data) or information of a frequency-transformed frequency domain (e.g.,<br>
scale factor coefficient, spectral data).<br>
The partial band encoding unit 120 generates a narrowband signal and band<br>
extension information from a broadband signal.<br>
In this case, an original signal including a plurality of bands is named a<br>
broadband signal and at least one of a plurality of the bands is named a narrowband<br>
signal. For instance, in a broadband signal including two bands (a low frequency<br>
band and a high frequency band), either one of the bands is named a narrowband<br>
signal. Moreover, a partial band indicates a portion of the whole narrowband signal<br>
and shall be named a copy band in the following description.<br>
The band extension information is the information for generating a target<br>
band using the copy band. And, the band extension information can include<br>
frequency information, gain information, harmonic information and the like. In a<br>
decoder, the broadband signal is generated from combining the target band with the<br>
narrowband signal.<br>
If a specific frame or segment of a downmix signal (narrowband downmix<br>
signal DMXn) has a large audio characteristic, the audio signal encoding unit 130<br>
encodes the downmix signal according to an audio coding scheme. In this case, the<br>
audio signal may comply with AAC (advanced audio coding) standard or HE-AAC<br>
(high efficiency advanced audio coding) standard, by which the present invention is<br>
not limited. Moreover, the audio signal encoding unit 130 may correspond to an<br>
MDCT (modified discrete transform) encoder.<br>
If a specific frame or segment of a downmix signal (narrowband downmix<br>
signal DMXn) has a large speech characteristic, the speech signal encoding unit 140<br>
encodes the downmix signal according to a speech coding scheme. In this case, the<br>
speech signal can include G. 7XX or AMR- series, by which examples of the speech<br>
signal are not limited. Meanwhile, the speech signal encoding unit 140 can further use<br>
a linear prediction coding (LPC) scheme. If a harmonic signal has high redundancy on<br>
a time axis, it can be modeled by linear prediction for predicting a present signal from<br>
a past signal. In this case, if the linear prediction coding scheme is adopted, it is able to<br>
increase coding efficiency. Moreover, the speech signal encoding unit 140 can<br>
correspond to a time domain encoder.<br>
Thus, the narrowband downmix is encoded per frame or segment by either<br>
the audio signal encoding unit 130 or the speech signal encoding unit 140.<br>
And, the multiplexer 150 generates a bitstream by multiplexing the spatial<br>
information generated by the multi-channel encoding unit 110, the band extension<br>
information generated by the partial band encoding unit 120 and the encoded<br>
narrowband downmix signal.<br>
In the following description, the detailed configuration of the partial band<br>
encoding unit 120 is explained with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the partial band encoding unit 120 includes a spectral data<br>
obtaining unit 122, a copy band determining unit 124, a gain information obtaining<br>
unit 126, a harmonic component information obtaining unit 128, and a band extension<br>
information transferring unit 129.<br>
If a received broadband signal is not spectral data, the spectral data obtaining<br>
unit 122 generates spectral data in a manner of converting a downmix to a spectral<br>
coefficient, scaling the spectral coefficient with a scale factor and then performing<br>
quantization. In this case, the spectral data includes spectral data of broadband<br>
corresponding to a broadband downmix.<br>
The copy band determining unit 124 determines a copy band and a target<br>
band based on the spectral data of the broadband and generates frequency<br>
information for band extension. In this case, the frequency information can include a<br>
start frequency, start band information or the like. In the following description, the<br>
copy band and the like are explained with reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram for relations among a copy band, a target band and a start<br>
band according to the present invention, and FIG. 4 is a diagram for partial band<br>
extension according to second to fourth embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, total n scale factor bands (sfb) 0 to n-1 exist and spectral<br>
data corresponding to the scale factor bands sfb0 to sfbn-1 exist, respectively. Spectral<br>
data sdi belonging to a specific band can mean a set of a plurality of spectral data sdi-0<br>
to sdi_m-1. The number mi of the spectral data can be generated to correspond to a<br>
spectral data unit, a band unit or a unit over the former unit. In this example, a 0th<br>
scale factor band sfbo corresponds to a low frequency band and an (n-1)th scale factor<br>
band sfbn-i corresponds to an upper part, i.e., a high frequency band. Alternatively, a<br>
configuration reverse to this example is possible.<br>
Spectral data corresponding to a broadband signal is the spectral data<br>
corresponding to the total band sfbo to sfbn-i including a first band and a second band.<br>
Spectral data corresponding to a narrowband downmix DMXn is the spectral data<br>
corresponding to the first band and include the spectral data of the 0th band sfbo to the<br>
spectral data of the (i-1)th band sfbi-1. In particular, the narrowband spectral data are<br>
transferred to a decoder, while the spectral data of the rest of the bands sfb1 to sfbn-1<br>
are not transferred thereto.<br>
Thus, the decoder generates the band that does not carry the spectral data.<br>
And, this band is called a target band tb. Meanwhile, a copy band cb is a scale factor<br>
band of spectral data used in generating the spectral data of the target band tb. The<br>
copy band includes portions sfbs to sfbi-1 of the bands sfbo to sfbi-i corresponding to<br>
the narrowband downmix. A band, from which the copy band cb starts, is a start<br>
band sb and a frequency of the start band is a start frequency. In other words, the<br>
copy band cb can be the start band sb itself, may include the start band and a<br>
frequency band higher than the start band, or can include the start band and a<br>
frequency band lower than the start band.<br>
According to the present invention, an encoder generates narrowband<br>
spectral data and band extension information using broadband spectral data, while a<br>
decoder generates spectral data of a target band using spectral data of a copy band<br>
among narrowband spectral data.<br>
FIG. 4 shows three kinds of embodiments of partial band extension. A copy<br>
band can generate a target band as a partial band of a whole narrow band. In this case,<br>
the copy band can be located on an upper frequency band. At least one copy band can<br>
exist and in case a plurality of copy bands exist, the bands can be equally or variably<br>
spaced apart from each other.<br>
Referring to (A) of FIG. 4, partial band extension is shown in case a bandwidth<br>
of a copy band is equal to a bandwidth of a target band. In particular, the copy band<br>
cb includes an sth band sfbs corresponding to a start band sb, an (n-4)th band sfbn-4 and<br>
an (n-2)th band sfbn-2. An encoder is able to omit transferring of spectral data of the<br>
target band located on the right of the copy band using the spectral data of the copy<br>
band. Meanwhile, it is able to generate gain information (g) which is a difference<br>
between the spectral data of the copy band and the spectral data of the target band.<br>
This will be explained later.<br>
(B) of FIG. 4 indicates a copy band and a target band that are different in<br>
bandwidth. A bandwidth of the target band is equal to or greater than two<br>
bandwidths (tb and tb') of the copy band. In this case, bandwidths of the target band<br>
can be generated by applying different gains gs and gs+1, respectively, to the spectral<br>
data of the copy band bandwidth and tb of the target band.<br>
Referring to (C) of FIG. 4, after spectral data of a target band have been<br>
generated using spectral data of a copy band, it is able to generate spectral data of<br>
second target band, sfbk to sfbn-1, using spectral data corresponding to bands sfbk0 to<br>
sfbk-1 adjacent to a second start bad sfbk. In this case, a frequency band of a start band<br>
corresponds to 1/8 of a sampling frequency fs and the secondary start band may<br>
correspond to 1/4 of the sampling frequency fs, by which examples of the present<br>
invention are not limited.<br>
The relevance of the target band, the copy band and the start band according<br>
to the various embodiments of the present invention are previously explained. The<br>
rest of the elements are explained with reference to FIG. 2 as follows.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the copy band determining unit.<br>
124 determines a copy band, a target band and a start band, sb of the copy band. The<br>
start band can be variably determined per frame. This can also be determined<br>
according to a characteristic of a signal per frame. In particular, the start band can be<br>
determined according to whether a signal is transient or stationary. For example, a<br>
start band can be determined as a low frequency when a signal is transient since the<br>
signal has less harmonic components than when it is stationary.<br>
Meanwhile, the start band can be determined as a numerical value of<br>
brightness of sound using a spectral centroid. For instance, if a sound is relatively<br>
high(when high-pitched tone is dominant), a start band can be formed in high<br>
frequency band. If a sound is relatively low(when low-pitched tone is dominant), a<br>
start band can be formed in low frequency band. Although the start band is<br>
determined variably per frame, it is preferable to form the start band by considering<br>
the trade-off between sound quality and bitrate.<br>
The copy band determining unit 124 outputs a narrowband downmix DMXn<br>
or the spectral data of the narrowband excluding the spectral data of the target band.<br>
This narrowband downmix is inputted to the audio signal encoding unit or the speech<br>
signal encoding unit described in FIG. 1.<br>
The copy band determining unit 124 generates start band information that<br>
indicates start frequency information on a start frequency from which the copy band<br>
cb starts or a start band information of the copy band cb. The start band information<br>
can be represented not only as a substantial value but also as index information.<br>
When the start band information is represented as the index information, the start<br>
band information corresponding to the index is stored in a table and can be used in a<br>
decoder. The start band information is forwarded to the band extension information<br>
transferring unit 129 and is then included as band extension information.<br>
The gain information obtaining unit 126 generates gain information using the<br>
spectral data of the target band and the copy band. In this case, the gain information<br>
can be defined as an energy ratio of target band to copy band and can be defined as<br>
the following formula.<br>
[Formula 1]<br><br>
In Formula 1, 'gi' indicates a gain and 'i' indicates a current target band.<br>
This gain information can be determined for each target band as previously<br>
shown. The gain information is forwarded to the band extension information<br>
transferring unit 129 and is then included as the band extension information as well.<br>
The harmonic component information obtaining unit 128 generates harmonic<br>
component information by analyzing a harmonic component of the copy band. The<br>
harmonic component information is forwarded to the band extension information<br>
transferring unit 129 and is then included as the band extension information as well.<br>
The band extension information transferring unit 129 outputs band extension<br>
information having the start band information, gain information and harmonic<br>
component information included therein. This band extension information is inputted<br>
to the multiplexer described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
Thus, the narrowband downmix and the band extension information are<br>
generated by the above-described method. In the following description, a process for<br>
generating a broadband downmix in a decoder using band extension information and<br>
a narrowband downmix is explained.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an audio signal decoding apparatus according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 6 is a detailed block diagram of a<br>
partial band decoding unit shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an audio signal decoding apparatus 200 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a demultiplexer 210, an audio signal<br>
decoding unit 220, a speech signal decoding unit 230, a partial band decoding unit 240,<br>
and a multi-channel decoding unit 250.<br>
The demultiplexer 210 extracts a narrowband downmix DMXn, band<br>
extension information and spatial information from a bitstream. If a narrowband<br>
downmix signal has more audio characteristic, the audio signal decoding unit 220<br>
decodes the narrowband downmix signal by an audio coding scheme. In this case, as<br>
mentioned in the foregoing description, an audio signal can comply with AAC or HE-<br>
AAC standard. If the narrowband downmix signal has more speech characteristic, the<br>
speech signal decoding unit 230 decoded the narrowband downmix signal by a<br>
speech coding scheme.<br>
The partial band decoding unit 240 generates a broadband signal by applying<br>
the band extension information to the narrowband downmix, which will be explained<br>
in detail with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
The multi-channel decoding unit 250 generates an output signal using the<br>
broadband downmix and the spatial information.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the partial band decoding unit 240 includes a band<br>
extension information receiving unit 242, a copy band determining unit 244 and a<br>
target band information generating unit 246. The partial band decoding unit 240 can<br>
further include a signal reconstructing unit 248.<br>
The band extension information receiving unit 242 extracts start band<br>
information, gain information and harmonic component information from the band<br>
extension information, which are sent to the copy band determining unit 244 and the<br>
target band information generating unit 246.<br>
The copy band determining unit 244 determines a copy band using a<br>
narrowband downmix DMXn and start band information. In this case, if the<br>
narrowband downmix DMXn is not spectral data of a narrowband, it is converted to<br>
spectral data. Moreover, the copy band may be equal to or different from a start band.<br>
If the copy band is different from the start band, from a band corresponding to the<br>
start band information to a band having spectral data are determined as the copy<br>
band. Spectral data determined by the copy band are forwarded to the target band<br>
information generating unit 246.<br>
The target band information generating unit 246 generates spectral data of a<br>
target band using the spectral data of the copy band, the gain information and the like.<br>
Data of target band can be generated by the following formula.<br>
[Formula 2]<br><br>
In Formula 2, 'gi' indicates a gain of a current band, 'sd(target_band)' indicates<br>
spectral data of target band, and 'sd(copy_band)' indicates spectral data of copy band.<br>
In case of the former embodiment shown in (A) of FIG. 4, gain (gs, gs-4, gs-2,<br>
etc.) can be applied to a copy band that is located on the left of a target band. In case of<br>
the forma- embodiment shown in (B) of FIG. 4, for a first target band tb, it is able to<br>
apply a gain (gs, gn-3) to spectral data of a copy band. For a second target band tb',<br>
different gain (gs*gs+1, gn-3* gn-2) can be applied to spectral data of a copy band. In case<br>
of the former embodiment shown in (C) of FIG. 4, after a gain (gs) has been applied to<br>
spectral data sds of a copy band corresponding to a partial area of a narrowband,<br>
spectral data of a secondary target band (tb) are generated by applying a different<br>
gain (g2nd) to a whole narrowband.<br>
Meanwhile, the number of spectral data of target band Nt may differ from the<br>
number of spectral data of copy band Nc. This case is explained as follows. FIG. 7 is a<br>
diagram for a case that the number of spectral data of a target band Nt is greater than<br>
that of spectral data of a copy band Nc, and FIG. 8 is a diagram for a case that the<br>
number of spectral data of a target band Nt is smaller than that of spectral data of a<br>
copy band Nc.<br>
Referring to (A) of FIG. 7, it can be observed that the number Nt of spectral<br>
data of a target band sfbi is 36 and it can be also observed that the number Nc of<br>
spectral data of a copy band sfbs is 24. In the drawing, the greater the number of data<br>
is, the longer a horizontal length of a band gets. Since the number of data of the target<br>
band is greater than the other, it is able to use the data of the copy band at least twice.<br>
For instance, a low frequency of the target band, as shown in (B41) of FIG. 7, is firstly<br>
filled with 24 data of the copy band and the rest of the target band is then filled with<br>
12 data in a front or rear part of the copy band. Of source, it is able to apply the<br>
transferred gain information as well.<br>
Referring to (A) of FIG. 8, it can be observed that the number Nt of spectral<br>
data of a target band sfbi is 24 and the number Nc of spectral data of a copy band sfbs<br>
is 36. Since the number of data of the target band is smaller than the other, it is able to<br>
partially use the data of the copy band only. For instance, it is able to generate spectral<br>
data of the target band sfbi using 24 spectral data in a front area of the copy band sfbs,<br>
as shown in (B) of FIG. 8, or 24 spectral data in a rear area of the target band sfbi, as<br>
shown in (C) of FIG. 8.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, the target information generating unit 246 generates<br>
spectral data of the target band by applying the gains in the above-mentioned various<br>
methods. In generating the spectral data of the target band, the target band<br>
information generating unit 246 is able to further use the harmonic component<br>
information. In particular, using the harmonic component information transferred by<br>
the encoder, it is able to generate a sub-harmonic signal corresponding to the number<br>
of size of the target band by phase synthesis or the like.<br>
The target band information generating unit 246 is able to generate spectra<br>
data by combination of a time dilatation/compression step and a decimation step. In<br>
this case, the time dilatation/compression step may include a step of dilating a time-<br>
domain signal in a temporal direction and this dilatation step can use a phase vocoder<br>
scheme. The decimation step may include a step of compressing a time-dilated signal<br>
into an original time. It is able to apply the time dilatation/ compression step and the<br>
decimation step to target band spectral data.<br>
The signal reconstructing unit 248 generates a broadband signal using the<br>
target band spectral data and the narrowband signal. In this case, the broadband<br>
signal may include spectral data of a broadband or may correspond to a signal in a<br>
time domain.<br>
An audio signal processing method according to the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a computer-readable program and can be stored in a recordable<br>
medium. Multimedia data having the data structure of the present invention can also<br>
be stored in the computer-readable recordable medium. The recordable media<br>
includes all kinds of storage devices which are capable of storing data readable by a<br>
computer system. The recordable media include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic<br>
tapes, floppy discs, optical data storage devices, and the like for example and also<br>
include carrier-wave type implementations (e.g., transmission via Internet). Bitstream<br>
generated by the encoding method can be stored in a computer-readable recordable<br>
media or transmitted via wire/wireless communication network.<br>
