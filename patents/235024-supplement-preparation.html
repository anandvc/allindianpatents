Title: Supplement preparation<br>
Technical Field<br>
5    The invention relatest to a prophylactic and therapeutic supplernent prepation.in<br>
particular for animals.<br>
Background Art<br>
10 For competitive reasons, modem times livestock breeding, as such breeding of<br>
furred animals and milkers, often requires large herds. This entails a high risk of in<br>
fectious diseases, which may result in deaths and in serious cases necessitate the de-<br>
struction of an entire herd involving heavy economic losses,<br>
15 For preventing these situations, antibiotics are widely used, which should be consid-<br>
ered alarming in the long view, as such a wide use furthers the development of anti-<br>
biotic-resistant pathogenes.<br>
In general, rational and efficient production methods are used today in modern live-<br>
20    slock buddings, the use of which would be impossible without the use of antibiotics<br>
for both prevention and cure. This situation is for instance typical :n poultry and pig<br>
production.<br>
From an ethical assessment of the animals' welfare and suffering in connection with<br>
25 diseases, it is highly desirable to fulfil a primary health objective based on a signifi-<br>
cant strengthening of the animal's natural immure system as defence against various<br>
bacteria and viruses and thus allow for the removal of all antibiotics from ammal<br>
product) on.<br>
30 In mink breeding, problems with diseases such as plasinacytosist puppy disease<br>
(caused by the distemper virus: canine dial a wiper vims), virus enteritis, three-day<br>
sickness and sticky kits (diarrhoea condition found in minks during the suckling pe-<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
2<br>
nod and possibly caused by a too high lipid-to-protein ratio in the feed). Such dis-<br>
eases often result in heavy losses and increased use of antibiotics.<br>
Silver m a biologically accessible form, such as colloidal silver, wss commonly used<br>
5    uritil 1938. Since then the pharmaceutical industry has taken over the field of disease<br>
combating,mid the research on colloidal silver has been shelved in competition with<br>
faster-acting and economically more lucrative drugs.<br>
The therapeutic and prophylactic use of biologically accessible silver should be per-<br>
10    formed with the utmost caution and only ra very low doses, the silver accumulating<br>
im the organism, especially in the liver, causing, a weakening of the immune system.<br>
Especially at prophylactic use, where silver is administered on a regular basis, it<br>
may be difficult or practically impossible to obtain positive results without in fact<br>
deteriorating the state of health in the long view<br>
15<br>
In the past 30 years, ox and shark cartilage has been used for the treatment of a num-<br>
ber of diseases It is assumed that cartilage kills cancer cells directly, Stimulates the<br>
immune system and inhibits the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis)<br>
which the cancer cells need in order to grow uninhibited!/- A few tests are known in<br>
20 which cartilage has been used for the treatment of cancer in humans, but the results<br>
thereof have not been unambiguous- Shark cartilage is sold as a powder and is an<br>
excellent source of calcium, phosphor, amino acids and mucopolysaccharides.<br>
WO 94/] 2510 slates that in addition to the inherent nutritional benefit of shark carh-<br>
25    lage, it is believed that two factors are also important in producing the beneficial<br>
health effects attributed to shark cartilage. One factor is the carbohydrate or muco-<br>
pojysaccharide content of the shark cartilage which is believed to stimulate the im-<br>
mune system of the body to resist arid fight disease. The second iraportant fector is<br>
the anti angiogenic factor found in the protein portion, which can contain as many as<br>
30    five different active proteins.<br><br>

EP-A-I 308 155 discloses an injectable solution containing a colloid of iron and<br>
shark cartilage-derived chondroitin sulphate. Such injecteble solution is not suitable<br>
for a prophylactic daily use in animal breeding- Use of cofliodal silver is not sug-<br>
gested in EP-A-1 308 155.<br>

IP patent publication No 2002-145794 (application No. 2001-255278} discloses an<br>
anti-arthritic or anti-rheumatic preparation containing art extract of the plant Withata<br>
somnifera Dunaf combined with an extract of cartilage, such as shark cartilage.<br>
10 In the field of health food, antimony pentasulphide (Sb3Ss, golden antimony sul-<br>
phide) is recommended against winter coughs and bronchitis. Antimony pentasul-<br>
phide is also used in combination with tin iodide, eg as a preparation known as<br>
"Brorofn-adult" or -child11 The use of zinc preparations, eg, zinc isovalerate or me-<br>
tallic zfnc, is also recommended within the field of health food.<br>
15<br>
The recommendations in the health food field often concern very small amounts of<br>
the components in question, eg as a daily supplement However, in many cases, the<br>
claimed effects are not sufficiently well documented and there has existed a wide-<br>
spread doubtful or sceptical attitude towards the product range of the health food<br>
20 market. Without considering whether the sceptical attitude is well founded or not, it<br>
may be established that these materials are not among the first ones considered by<br>
the livestock breeder for solving the above problems with infectious diseases among<br>
livestock.<br>
25 It has now been found that by combining biologically accessible silver with a carti-<br>
lage preparation the positive effect of silver can be enhanced to allow the use thereof<br>
in such low amounts that the unintended and detrimental accumulation of silver in<br>
the organism, eg in the liver, can be avoided of reduced to a harmless level.<br>
30 Furthermore, it has been found that by adding very small amounts of additional se-<br>
lected components to such a silver/caitilage combination, the health-ptomoring ef-<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
4<br>
feet of this combination can be sustained.<br>
Tt has thus been found that a preparation with a surprisingly effective prevention of<br>
diseases, including highly infectious diseases, can be formulated by means of the<br>
5    combination, preferably with some supplement components, which each has a<br>
proven or presumed health-promoting effect on humans- This surprising effect has<br>
already been seen in minks in areas with serious plasmacytosis problems. It seems to<br>
indicate Chat the said wish to completely avoid the use of antibiotics in livestock<br>
breeding can be fulfilled within a short time frame.<br>
10<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a supplement preparation including a) a first active<br>
component in form of biologically accessible silver, b) a second active component in<br>
15    form of a material obtained from cartilage, and any conventional accessory agents or<br>
additives.<br>
It is assumed that an important effect of the supplement preparation is due to the fact<br>
th£t cartilage} such as shark cartilage, contains substances acting as catalysts on the<br>
20 boosting of the immune system by the biologically accessible silver such that the<br>
immune system is enhanced to a level far exceeding the effect of the individual sub-<br>
stances. The intensifying effect has the special advantage that a positive effect can<br>
be obtained with very modest silver amounts such that the problems with silver ac-<br>
cumulation in the liver are avoided.<br>
25<br>
Moreover, it has been found that one or more different active substances, in particu-<br>
lar such substances recommended within the homoeopathic field, directed towards<br>
diseases causing problems among die livestock in question, advantageously may be<br>
added to the supplement preparation- As a result, in addition to the effect on the im-<br>
30 mune system, which provides a general improvement of the state of health of an<br>
animal population a noticeable combating of such specific diseases is obtained.<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
5<br>
The supplement preparation may thus advantageously include one or more- addi-<br>
tional active components. Such additional active compounds may be selected among<br>
antimony pent a sulphide, metallic tin and/or a tin salt, metallic zinc and/or a zinc salt,<br>
5    a sulphur containing substance and/or a iodine containing substance.<br>
A useful sulphur containing substance is a calcium liver preparation which is com-<br>
mercially available as "hepar- sulphuris". Examples of iodine containing substances<br>
are tin iodide, calcium iodine and tare powder.<br>
10<br>
Useful active components optionally being included in the supplement preparation<br>
are antimony pejitasulphide, metallic tin and/or a tin salt, and metallic zinc and/or a<br>
zinc salt The tin salt may be an inorganic or an organic tin salt, preferably a tin hal-<br>
ide such as tfn iodide- The zinc salt may be an inorganic or an organic zinc salt;<br>
15    preferably a zinc salt of an organic caiboxylic acid as for instance zinc isovalerate<br>
Although the actual mechanism is not yet known some of the additional active com-<br>
ponents are inter alia believed \.o affect the liver metabolism, wbicft further prevents<br>
silver from accumulating in the liver.<br>
20<br>
Colloidal silver is a suitable form of biologically accessible silver for USE as the first<br>
component (a). A. suttahle cartilaginous material for use as the second active com<br>
ponent (b) is a material, eg a dried powder; derived from a cartilaginous fish, pref-<br>
25    erably a shark.<br>
The ratio between the active components fa) and (b) in the preparation according to<br>
the invention may vary greatly depending on the animal species and the ages of the<br>
animals. Usually the weight ratio a:b is between 1; 100,000 and 1:10. According to a<br>
30 preferred embodiment the content of cartilaginous material, calculated as dry matter,<br>
is 100 - -12000parts by weight per 1 part by weight of biological accessibble silver<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
6<br>
preferably 200 - 6000 parts by weight per 1 part by weight of biologically accessible<br>
silver and most preferably 300 - 3000 parts by weight per \ part by weight of bio-<br>
logically accessible silver<br>
5 Thfc contend of the biologically accessible silver may also vary greats depending ofl<br>
the animal species and the ago of tfie animals. Usually the Ag content is between 0,1<br>
arid 100 mg per litre preparation. According to a preferred embodiment, The prepaia-<br>
tion contains 0.5 - 50 mg of biologically accessible silver per litre? preparation, pref-<br>
erably 1 - 20 mg per litre.<br>
10<br>
The invention further relates to a uss of (a), a first active compoivent in form of bio*<br>
logically accessible silver, (b), a second active component in form of a material de-<br>
rived from cartilage and any additional active components and/or conventional ac-<br>
cessory agents or additives foi I he preparation of a health-promoting supplement<br>
15    preparation for livestock.<br>
The extent of applicability of the invention appears from the following detailed de-<br>
scription. It should, however, be understood that the detailed description and the<br>
specific examples are merely included to illustrate the preferred embodiments, and<br>
20 that various alterations and modifications within the scope of protection will be ob-<br>
vious to persons skilled in the art on the basis of the detailed description.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
15 As a  base component in the preparation according to the invention biologically ac-<br>
cessible silver is used, eg in form of colloid-dispersed silver in water, also denoted<br>
as colloidal silver. For the prophylactic use for rninks, the silver concentration may<br>
be about 3 mg per litre, which corresponds to 3 mg/ml. In this concentration, a daily<br>
amount of about 8 ml per day may for instance be used in the feed for 100 bitches of<br>
30 a weight of between 1 -2-1.8 kg, Tin's corresponds to 8 ml x 3 mg/ml = 24 fig Ag for<br>
100 x 1.5 kg body weight per day, ie 0 16 mg Ag per kg per day.<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
7<br>
The silver content in the basic component of the preparation may vary, but is usually<br>
chosen from between 0.5 and SO (Jg/nti. The daily dosage varies depending on the<br>
animal species in question^ fee animaTs age, sex and general state of health, and<br>
5    usually between Ing and 1 ng Ag per kg of body weight per day.<br>
At present, a silver concentration in the preparation for poultry is envisaged to be -<br>
5, preferably 2 — 3 mg/ml of silver used in a daily dosage of 0.01 - 0.21 preferably<br>
0,09 - 0.04 ng Ag per kg body weight per day.<br>
10<br>
Correspondingly, for grown sows, a silver concentration in the preparation of 10 -<br>
25, preferably 16 — 20 ug/ml of silver used in a daily dosage of 1 mg - 0.01 p.g, pref-<br>
erably 4 - 6 ng Ag per kg body weight per day ia envisaged,<br>
15 For mink, a silver concentration in the preparation of 0-5- 10. preferably ] -6 mg/ml<br>
of silver used fn a daily dosage of 0.01 - 0,3 jig, preferably 0.1 - 0.4mg Ag per kg.<br>
body weight per day is envisaged.<br>
According to present practice, the often-recommended dosages of colloidal silver for<br>
20    use in humans are of a level, which must be considered alarming due to the silver<br>
accumulation m the organism- Also as regards humans, it is expected that it is possi-<br>
ble to obtain health-promoting effects at considerably lower and safer silver dosages<br>
by combining biologically accessible silver and a cartilaginous material The sup-<br>
plement preparation according to the invention thus also has potential in relation to<br>
25    humans.<br>
The second active component, derived from cartilage, may for instance be used [n<br>
form of a dried and ground powder obtained as a by-product from sharks in an<br>
amount of 0.5 - 100 g per litre (= 0.5 - 100 mg/ml) in the preparation, preferably 1 -<br>
30  g per litre. The daily doses of the cartilaginous material typically range from 1 mg<br>
- 1 mg per tg body weight, preferably from 3 mg to 0,5 mg per kg. For mink 0.2 -<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
s<br>
0,3 mg/kg is typically used. For poultry 0.01-0-1 mg/kg is typically used, while the<br>
daily dosages for grown sows are envisaged to range from 1 |ig to 0,0 1mg per kg. It<br>
should, however, be noted that a too high dosage of cartilaginous material does not<br>
have the same serious consequence as a too high silver dosage<br>
5<br>
In ratio lo the silver amount, the cartilage powder is preferably used in an amount of<br>
0.05 - 12.5 g per mg Ag, more preferably in the range from 0.1 to 7.5 g per mg Ag,<br>
and most preferably in the range from 0.5 - 4.0 gper mg Ag,<br>
10 The combined Ag/cartiiage preparation forms a sound basis for a number of sup-<br>
plementary active substances with health-promoting effect, in particular such sub-<br>
stances known from the homoeopathic treatment of humans. Such substances are<br>
available on the market and in the examples rendered below these have been identi-<br>
fied on the basis of information received from the suppliers. In homoeopaihy, con-<br>
15 centration specifications are used, in which for instance D6 means 1:10"6, ie. the<br>
same as ppm. Whether such specifications denote the weight ratio (D6 = mg/kg) or<br>
the weight/volume ratio (D6 - I mg/litre) is not always clear, nor is it always clear<br>
whether for instance a metallic salt is calculated on the basis of the metal ion or the<br>
entied salt molecule<br>
20<br>
Despite these problems, the illustrative numbers stated in the present description<br>
provide the person skilled in the art with a guide as to advantageous amounts used at<br>
routine adjustments of the each of the active substances to a specific animal species<br>
or specific hards with special health problems<br>
25<br>
It should, however, once more be emphasized that the silver as well as many of the<br>
possible supplementary additions are used in very small amounts,only about 1 ml of<br>
a product with an active substance content of from D6 to D12 (1:1011) being used<br>
for 1 litre of preparation, of which a daily addition of 4 - 8 ml to the feed for 100<br>
30 animal being usad or for tlie treatment of individual animal merely one of two<br>
drops being used.<br><br>

20    Example 6<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
A base supplement preparation for livestock is prepared in the same manner as the<br>
preparation in example 1 based on  the following constituents:<br><br><br>
Shark cartilage powder	0.5- 30 g<br>
Broron-adult	0.05-20 g<br>
Zincum met D10	0.5-5 ml<br>
Heparsulphuris D12	0.5-5 ml<br>
Tare powder	0.5- 10 g<br>
Silver dispersion (1-40 μg/ml)	quantum satis 1 litre<br>
According to need, this base preparation may be adapted to the animal species, age<br>
and state of health by adding additional active substances.<br>
Example 7<br>
10<br>
The supplement preparation made according to example 2 has been tested on a mink<br>
farm with 300 bitches and their approx. 1500 tits. From mid April the bitches re-<br>
ceived a daily dose of 8 ml per 100 bitches of the preparation as a supplement to the<br>
usal feed.From june 9,the bitches received a daily dose of 8ml/100bitches,while<br>
15 the kits received 4 ml/100 kits. On June 29 the dose was changed to 7 ml/100 ani-<br>
mals both for bitches and for kits.<br>
A significant improvement of the state of health was noted on the mink farm.The<br>
kits seem heavier and more vigorous than previously. There was a lower kit mortal-<br>
20 ity rate, more calm bitches and only a single death during the period, which is un-<br>
usual. There were no "sticky kits" even though feed was administered according to<br>
appetite after May 11. As beforev a few bitches stopped lactating, ie. premature<br>
cease of milk production. This problem thus remains unsolved, but it is most likely<br>
not linked to the immune system<br>
25<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
14<br>
The growth of the kits was particularly good, the animals seemed to thrive optimally<br>
and their manure was of a high quality. The latter represents a measure by means of<br>
which deteriorations in the animals' state of health can be detected.<br>
5    Example 8<br>
Similar tests were carried out on three other mink farms, said tests were initiated on<br>
May 2,2003 by  administering the supplement preparation according to example 2 to<br>
200-300 bitches per farm in a dosage of the amount as in example 6. Already in the<br>
10 period of June 10 - 15 the test was expanded to include all animals of the three<br>
farms, ie a total of about 7300 bitches and 37000 kits. On July 12, 2003 the manager<br>
of the three mink farms reported:<br>
-	a significantly lower kit mortality rate from whelping to date;<br>
15    -    no cases of diarrhoea, mastitis or "sticky" Icits, the use of antibiotics has thus not<br>
been required;<br>
-	hardly any loss of breeding bitches from whelping to date;<br>
-	no agitation or fights among 4 - 6 weeks old kits, significantly less ear sucking<br>
and neck biting;<br>
20    -	the animals were calm with no signs of stress,<br>
-	considerably increased weight at weaning;<br>
-	peace and no Stress after weaning, no bite injuries.<br>
-	optimum use of the feed and the animals always had fine bowels movements;<br>
-	good appetite without deviations after wearing;<br>
25    -    increased growth and reduced feed consumption than normally.<br>
Example 9<br>
At the mink farm A the entire herd had to be destructed due to plasmacytosis.<br>
30    Thereafter mated beaches were bought in April 2003 from the mink farm B.<br><br>
WO2005/0114000 PCT/DK2004/000521<br>
15<br>
The animals at mink farm A and mink farm B were feed with the same type of feed<br>
from the same supplier during The entire period until pelting with the only difference<br>
that   the animals an farm A also received the supplement preparation according to<br>
example 2 as described in example 7,<br>
5<br>
The quality of the furs obtained from almost all males were estimated at the Copers<br>
hagen Fur Center, Glosimp, Denmark and the furs were classified in five qualities<br>
and the quality index calculated. The best quality is "Saga Royal".<br><br>
Fur type	Scan	glow	Scan'	brown	<br>
	Mink farm A(receiving in-ventive sup-plement)	Mink farm B(without sup-plement)	Mink farm A(receiving in-ventive sup-plement)	Mink farm B(without sup-plement)	<br>
Saga Royal (%)	30	12	44	13	<br>
Saga (%)	53	60	46	62	<br>
A (%)	1	4	2	3	<br>
Quality I (%}	11	23	7	22	<br>
Quality II {%)	0	1	0	0	<br>
Quality Index	103	98	112	100	<br>
10<br>
As appears in case of Scanbrown the quality of the furs from mink farm B corre-<br>
sponds to the average quality (Index 100) among the about 2250 Danish rninkeries<br>
supplying mink furs to Copenhagen Fur Center whereas the furs from mink farm A<br>
with index 112 are above the 95 % fractile<br>
15<br>
In most cases a mink farmer selling out a part of his animals would keep the best<br>
animals for his own breeding stock- This make the increased quality of the furs from<br>
mink farm A it even more surprising.<br>
20 The above description of the invention reveals that it is obvious that it can be varied<br>
in may ways. Such variations ait not to be considered a deviation from the scope of<br>
the invention, and all such modifications, which are obvious to persons skilled in the<br>
art are also to be considered comprised by the scope of the succeeding claims.<br><br>
