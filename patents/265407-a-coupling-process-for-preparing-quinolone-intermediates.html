In one embodiment, the amino protecting group is tert-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Herein is described a process for the preparation of a substituted quinolone as depicted in general Formula I, wherein R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, R2 is C1-C4 alkyl or C3-C6 cycloalkyl, and R4 and R5 are each independently selected from a group consisting of amino, C1-C4 alkylamino, protected amino, and C1-C4 alkyl. A boron ester chelate of the 7-fluoroquinolone acid as depicted in general Formula II, wherein R1, R2, are as defined for Formula I, R3 is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted or substituted C1-C4 acyloxy, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, is charged to a reactor.  The solid is diluted with a solution of a suitable cyclic amine side chain as depicted in general Formula III, wherein R4 and R5 are as defined, and n is 1 or 2; and a tertiary amine base, in a suitable organic solvent for the coupling reaction to take place. The coupling reaction is kept between about 20°C to about 80°C until complete, The completion of the reaction may be determined by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy analyses that are known to one skilled in the art. The reaction solvent is partially removed by distillation to reduce the volume and the reaction is then diluted with an aqueous caustic solution to initiate hydrolysis of the boron ester chelate. Distillation, with heating, may be continued under vacuum for about 2 to 6 hours or until no further distillates are observed. The reaction progress may be monitored by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy. Upon completion, the reaction is neutralized by the addition of an acid until a pH of about 7 or below is achieved. An organic, water immiscible solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, is added to the reaction mixture, and agitation followed by phase separation is performed. The organic phase is removed and this extractive process is repeated, if desired. The organic extracts are charged to a reactor, concentrated to approximately 50% volume, if desired, and treated with an aqueous acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, to effect protecting group removal, e.g., tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.  The progress of the deprotection reaction may be monitored by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy. When the reaction is complete, the biphasic mixture is allowed to separate. The organic phase is removed from the reactor and extraction with additional organic solvent may be pertormed.  The acidified aqueous phase is diluted with water and residual organic solvent is removed. The pH of the reaction solution is adjusted to between about 7 to about 8 with aqueous caustic while keeping the temperature at about 30°C to about 70°C.  The precipitated solids are allowed to stir at about 40°C to about 60°C for at least about an hour and are then cooled. The solids may be isolated by suction<br>
filtration and washed with water.  The solid product may be dried in a vacuum oven at about 40°C to about 60°C to afford yields typically in the range of about 70-90%.<br><br>

The mixture is heated at about 90°C to about 130°C for about 1 to about 4 hours, cooled to about 20°C to about 90°C and a functionalized 7-fluoroquinolone as depicted in general Formula IV, is added. For the 7-fluoroquinolone of general Formula IV, R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, and R2 is C1-C4 alkyl or C3-C8 cycloalkyl. The reaction is again heated at about 90°C to about 130°C for about 3 to about 9 hours and then cooled. An aromatic solvent, e.g., toluene, is then added to the reaction. Another solvent, e.g., tert-butylmethyl ether, is then added to the reaction mixture to afford precipitation of the product. After cooling to about 0 to about 25°C, the product is removed via filtration and<br>
washed with ether.  The solid product is dried in a vacuum oven to afford yields typically in the range of 70-9 <br>

The resulting mixture is warmed to approximately 50°C until reaction is judged complete. Reaction progress is monitored by HPLC or reverse phase TLC. When complete, the reaction is cooled to approximately 35°C and reaction volume is reduced to approximately half by distillation of acetonitrile under vacuum between 0-400 torr. The reactor is then charged with 28.2 Kg of 3.0N NaOH (aq) solution and the temperature is raised to approximately 40°C. Distillation under vacuum is continued between 1-4 hours or until no further distillates are observed. The reaction is then cooled to room temperature and the hydrolysis reaction is monitored by HPLC or reverse phase TLC. Upon completion, the reaction mixture is neutralized to a pH of between 6-8 by adding ~4-5 Kg of glacial acetic acid. The reactor is then charged with 12.7 Kg (9.6 L) of dichloromethane as an extraction solvent, the mixture is agitated, phases are allowed to separate, and the organic dichloromethane phase is removed.

The reactor is then charged with 20.2 Kg 6.0N HC1 (aq) solution, the temperature is adjusted to 35°C, and agitation is allowed for at least 12 hours to permit the Boc deprotection reaction to occur. The reaction is monitored by HPLC or reverse phase TLC. When complete, agitation is discontinued and the phases are allowed to separate. The lower, organic phase is removed and set aside. The reactor is then charged with 12.7 Kg (9.6 L) of dichloromethane as an extraction solvent, the mixture is agitated, phases are allowed to separate, and the organic dichloromethane phase is removed. The organic extracts are combined and discarded. The remaining aqueous phase is diluted with 18.3 Kg distilled water and the temperature is raised to approximately 50°C. Distillation under vacuum (100-400 torr) is performed to remove residual dichloromethane from the reaction.
