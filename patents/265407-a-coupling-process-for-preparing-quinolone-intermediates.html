DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The protecting groups for amino group, or C1-C4 alkylamino group include, but are not limited to, carbamate groups, e.g., trichloroethoxycarbonyl, tribromoeUhoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, o-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, tert-amyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl; acyl groups, e.g., C1-C4 haloacetyl groups such as (mono-, di-, or<br><br>
tri-) bromoacetyl, (mono-, di-, or tri-) chloroacetyl, and (mono-, di-, or tri-) fluoroacetyl; arylalkyl groups, e.g., benzyl, diphenylmethyl, and trityl.<br>
In one embodiment, the amino protecting group is tert-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Herein is described a process for the preparation of a substituted quinolone as depicted in general Formula I, wherein R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, R2 is C1-C4 alkyl or C3-C6 cycloalkyl, and R4 and R5 are each independently selected from a group consisting of amino, C1-C4 alkylamino, protected amino, and C1-C4 alkyl. A boron ester chelate of the 7-fluoroquinolone acid as depicted in general Formula II, wherein R1, R2, are as defined for Formula I, R3 is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted or substituted C1-C4 acyloxy, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, is charged to a reactor.  The solid is diluted with a solution of a suitable cyclic amine side chain as depicted in general Formula III, wherein R4 and R5 are as defined, and n is 1 or 2; and a tertiary amine base, in a suitable organic solvent for the coupling reaction to take place. The coupling reaction is kept between about 20째C to about 80째C until complete, The completion of the reaction may be determined by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy analyses that are known to one skilled in the art. The reaction solvent is partially removed by distillation to reduce the volume and the reaction is then diluted with an aqueous caustic solution to initiate hydrolysis of the boron ester chelate. Distillation, with heating, may be continued under vacuum for about 2 to 6 hours or until no further distillates are observed. The reaction progress may be monitored by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy. Upon completion, the reaction is neutralized by the addition of an acid until a pH of about 7 or below is achieved. An organic, water immiscible solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, is added to the reaction mixture, and agitation followed by phase separation is performed. The organic phase is removed and this extractive process is repeated, if desired. The organic extracts are charged to a reactor, concentrated to approximately 50% volume, if desired, and treated with an aqueous acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, to effect protecting group removal, e.g., tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.  The progress of the deprotection reaction may be monitored by HPLC, TLC, or IR spectroscopy. When the reaction is complete, the biphasic mixture is allowed to separate. The organic phase is removed from the reactor and extraction with additional organic solvent may be pertormed.  The acidified aqueous phase is diluted with water and residual organic solvent is removed. The pH of the reaction solution is adjusted to between about 7 to about 8 with aqueous caustic while keeping the temperature at about 30째C to about 70째C.  The precipitated solids are allowed to stir at about 40째C to about 60째C for at least about an hour and are then cooled. The solids may be isolated by suction<br>
filtration and washed with water.  The solid product may be dried in a vacuum oven at about 40째C to about 60째C to afford yields typically in the range of about 70-90%.<br><br>

The mixture is heated at about 90째C to about 130째C for about 1 to about 4 hours, cooled to about 20째C to about 90째C and a functionalized 7-fluoroquinolone as depicted in general Formula IV, is added. For the 7-fluoroquinolone of general Formula IV, R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, and R2 is C1-C4 alkyl or C3-C8 cycloalkyl. The reaction is again heated at about 90째C to about 130째C for about 3 to about 9 hours and then cooled. An aromatic solvent, e.g., toluene, is then added to the reaction.

After cooling to about 0 to about 25째C, the product is removed via filtration and<br>
washed with ether.  The solid product is dried in a vacuum oven to afford yields typically in the range of 70-9 <br>
