BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an interior wall formwork, and more particularly to a<br>
formwork construction method for inner wall and device thereof.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
During construction of a building, the interior and exterior wall formworks should be erected in advance and set apart at a specific distance, so as to allow the concrete to be poured in the space between the interior and exterior wall formworks. After the concrete hardens, the exterior wall formwork can be removed easily without the constraint of working space. However, the removal of the interior wall formwork is difficult due to the constraint of space and usually requires the worker to pry the formwork open, and thus it will likely generate side pressure against the wall that hasn't hardened completely, causing damage to the wall. The removal of the interior wall generally needs 24 hours after the concrete hardens, and it is really time consuming.<br>
The  present  invention  has   arisen  to  mitigate  and/or  obviate  the   afore-described<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the respective drawings, an interior wall formwork construction method in accordance with the present invention comprises the steps of: stripping the formwork, hoisting the formwork, supporting and spreading the formwork outward. The interior wall formwork 1 is hoisted by a crane.<br>
The stripping and spreading of the interior wall formwork 1 are achieved by a transverse motion machine A whose drive part doesn't move with the formwork, and the driven part is connected to the formwork and makes the formwork move transversely.<br>
The interior wall formwork 1 is supported by a bracket 21 that stands on a bearing block B of the interior wall and is hinged to the lower portion of the interior wall formwork 1.<br>
The stripping of the interior wall formwork 1 is achieved by the rotation of the driving part of the transverse motion machine A and the linear movement of the driven part.<br>
After stripping, the interior wall formwork 1 can be hoisted by a crane. During the hoisting of the interior wall formwork 1, the bracket 21 will spread automatically and negotiate the obstacles on the interior wall, and will stand at a higher bearing block B on the interior wall after reaching the predetermined position.<br><br>
After being well positioned, the interior wall formwork 1 can be pushed outward by an opposite rotation of the driving part of the transverse motion machine A and an opposite linear movement of the driven part.<br>
After spreading to a predetermined position, the interior wall formwork 1 can be connected to the exterior wall formwork, so as to allow the pouring of concrete.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, its operation and construction, references should be made to the following descriptions:<br>
1. Transverse motion machine:<br>
The aforementioned transverse motion machine A is a screw driven device comprising a screw shaft 2 and a nut 3, and the nut 3 is connected to the interior wall formwork 1 via a connecting board 4. For enabling the interior wall formwork 1 to be moved to the predetermined position, between the nut 3 and the connecting board 4 is disposed an adjusting mechanism that comprises a press board 5 and a connecting member 6. The nut 3 is formed at an end thereof with a flange 31. The connecting board 4 is mounted on the outer periphery of the nut 3 and a side of the connecting board 4 is located at a side of the flange 31. The press board 5 is mounted on the screw shaft 2, a side of the press board 5 is located at another side of the flange 31, and the press board 5 is connected to the connecting board 4 via the connecting member.<br>
The screw shaft 2 is provided with an abutting assembly 7 that is used to abut against the interior wall, and the abutting assembly 7 includes a left block 71 and a right block 72 that are disposed at both sides of the flange formed at the end of screw shaft 2.<br><br>
In order to make the upper and lower ends of the interior wall formwork 1 move synchronously and stably, the upper end of the interior wall formwork 1 is connected to a transverse motion machine 9 via a connecting member 8, and the drive part of transverse motion machine 9 is connected to the screw shaft 2 via a driven part. The transverse motion machine 9 in this embodiment is a screw driven device comprising a screw shaft and a nut. The upper end of the interior wall formwork 1 is mounted to the nut by the connecting member 8.<br>
In this embodiment, the rotary wheels 10 and 11 are chain wheels, the transmitting belt 12 between the rotary wheels 10 and 11 is a chain, and on the screw shaft 2 is arranged a manual spin handle 13.<br>
The nuts 3 and 3 A are disposed at both ends of the screw shaft 2, forming a screw driven<br>
mechanism, and the two nuts 3 and 3A rotate reversely and are connected the interior wall<br>
formworks 1 and la, respectively, so that two opposite interior walls can be constructed<br>
simultaneously. In addition, the transverse motion machine can be constructed both in<br>
longitudinal and transverse directions of a building, so that four walls can be constructed<br>
simultaneously.<br>
2. Bracket:<br>
The number of the bracket 21 hinged to the bottom of the interior wall formwork 1 at least<br>
corresponds with that of the interior wall formworks 1, the bracket 21 stands on the<br>
bearing block B of the interior wall, and in this embodiment, the bracket 21 is a supporting<br>
rod.<br><br>
If a building has three walls, there should be at least three brackets 21. In this embodiment, the building includes four walls, and there should be at least four brackets 21, the brackets 21 can be supporting rod or supporting board.<br>
In this embodiment, the bracket 21 is provided with an automatic spreading device for spreading the bracket 21 outward, and the spreading device in this embodiment is a weight rod 22, so that the bracket 21 can spread and stand on the bearing block B of the interior wall 1 automatically after being hoisted up.<br>
3. Bearing block B:<br>
The bearing block B is a positioning member mounted to the interior wall and can be<br>
arranged at the interior wall of a lower floor.<br>
For easy construction, the lower end of the bracket 21 can be fixed to the bearing block B by a positioning member 23 that has a locking groove 23A for engaging with the locking protrusion of the bearing block B. in this embodiment, the positioning member 23 is an independent structure mounted to the bracket 21.<br>
Due to the self servo action, the drive part of the screw driven device only needs a very small torque, the driven part can produce a large axial force. Therefore, the interior wall formwork can be stripped and moved easily. Besides, the screw driven device has a self lock function, it ensures that the interior wall formwork can be locked at a predetermined position after stripping. The screw shaft is provided with an abutting assembly for abutting against the interior wall, so that the interior wall formwork can be moved stably.<br><br>
In addition, the interior wall formwork is supported by the bracket, and there is no friction force when spreading the inner wall formwork, so that the drive force necessary for stripping and spreading the interior wall formwork is relatively small, and accordingly the operation is easy. Furthermore, the bracket for supporting the interior wall formwork stand on the bearing block B of a lower floor, therefore, the time for construction of interior wall formwork and the construction of the wall can be reduced effectively, and the interior wall formwork can be supported directly on the bearing block of the inner wall without any suspension device.<br>
