				<td>WITH AN ALKOXYSILANE COATING<br>
their use and in particular, to silane-containing compositions,<br>
Most metals are susceptible to corrosion, including the formation on the surface of the metal of various types of rust Such corrosion can affect the quality of the metal; reducing its value, worsening its appearance and decreasing customer satisfaction. Although rust may be removed, such removal can be costly and may reduce the strength of the metal. Also, corrosion may cause loss of adhesion to the metal of coatings such as paints, adhesives and/or rubbers.<br>
Methods of coating steel to reduce corrosion are known.<br>
Tims, Chil, T.F. and van Ooij, WJ. in "Application of Silane Technology to prevent Corrosion of Metals and improve Faint Adhesion" Transactions of the institute of Metal Finishing, Maney Publishing, Birmingham OB, vol. 77 no. Part 2, March 1999 (1999-03) page 64-70 describes silane treatments of metals.<br>
US patent US4828616 relates to an aqueous surface treatment composition comprising (a) an alkali metal silicate, (b) ammo alcohol and (c) a water-soluble resin selected from the group consisting of water soluble nylon, a natural polysaccharide and a water-soluble, natural protein and/or a water-soluble silane coupling agent<br>
WO 01/07680 relates to an aqueous composition for an anti-corrosion treatment of a metal substrate pre-treated with a zinc-based protective coating, which is an aqueous silane-based solution containing water, silane, boric acid and phosphoric acid, micronized silica and a wetting agent<br>
.   US patmt US 5 108793 relates to a method of coating steel with a corrosion resistant coating by rinsing the steel with an alkaline aqueous solution having an elevated temperature and including corrosion resistant amounts of a silicate and a metal, drying the steel to form a relatively insoluble silicate coating and then rinsing the silicate coated sheet in another aqueous solution which includes a corrosion resistant amount of a silane. According to US 5 108793, the sheet may be rinsed for at least 10 seconds with the silane solution containing at least 1 .0 vol % silane. Possible silanes are said to include 7 -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (OPS),  - ammo propyl tri(m)ethoxysilane (APS), Y - methacryloxypropyltrimeuioxysilane (MPS) and N-[2-vinyIbenzylarnino)ethyl]-3-<br>
aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (BPS), with APS and BPS being preferred. The silane is<br><br>
said to be dissolved into an aqueous solution in concentrations of 0.5-5 vol. % by being acidified.<br>
US patent US 5292549 relates to steel sheet coated with a thin film of sUoxane for suppressing nist According to US 5292549 several artisans have proposed rinsing galvanised steel in a bath containing up to about 10 wt.% of silane coupling agent prior to painting. Silanes proposed have said to inchide aminopropyl trimethyoxy, aminopropyl triethoxy, methacryloxy propyl trimelhoxy and glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy. It is said that the rinsed steel may be baked at an elevated temperature to form a hardened or permanent thick silane coating, which may be difficult to remove.<br>
The invention of US 5292549 is said to include a metallic coated steel sheet having a thin siloxane film which is the cured reaction product formed by rinsing the metallic coated steel sheet with an organic silane and a crosslinking agent Experiments are described in which solutions containing silane with and without crosslinking agent are used. Amino silanes are said to perform well with y - amino propyl trialkoxy silane (APS) being the most preferred. Examples of other silanes which can be used are said to be  -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy (GPS),  - memacryloxypropyllranethoxy, mercaptopnpvltrimethoxy or N-[2-vmylbenzylamino)ethyl]-3-aminopropyl trimethoxy (SAAPS) silane.<br>
US published patent application US 2005/058843 relates to a method of treating a metal surface particularly of zinc and zincalloys to pro vide a metal surface having improved corrosion resistance. The method comprises the steps of applying a silane solution to the metal surface, the silane solution having at least one vinyl silane and at least one bis-silyl aminosilane which have been at least partially hydrolysed.<br>
According to US 2005/058843, the silane compounds may be provided as a solution (preferably aqueous solution). According to US2005/058843, the vinyl silane(s) and aminosilane(s) in the solution are at least partially hydrolysed and preferably are substantially fully hydrolysed inorder to facilitate bonding of the silanes to the metal surface and to each other. According to US 2005/058843, during hydrolysis, the - OR1 groups are replaced by hydroxyl groups. Hydrolysis is said to be accomplished, for example, by merely mixing the silanes with water and optionally including a solvent (such as an alcohol) in order to improve silane solubility and solution stability.<br><br>
According to US 2005/058843, the solubility in water of some suitable silanes may be limited, so me treatment solution may optionally include one or more solvents (such as an alcohol) in order to improve silane solubility. Particularly preferred solvents are said to include: memanol, ethanol, 'propanol, and iso-propanol. ft is stated that since it is often desirable to limit, or even eliminate the use of organic solvents wherever possible, the solution is said to be more preferably aqueous in nature, thereby having less man 5 parts organic solvent for every 5 parts of water (i.e. more water than solvent). The solutions it is said, can even be substantially free of any organic solvent and when a solvent is used, ethanol is said to be preferred.<br>
WO01/06036 relates to a method of treating a metal surface by applying a solution comprising (i) at least one acyloxy silane which comprises at least one acyloxy group, wherein said silane has been at least partially hydrolysed, and (ii) at least one basic compound., wherein the acyloxy silane and the basic compound are present in concentrations to provide a solution pH of between about 3 and about 10 and wherein the solution is substantially free of acid other than acid produced upon hydrolysis of me acyloxy silane. Itistated that the treamientsolution amy optionally include oneormore compatible solvents (such as ethanol, memanol, propanol or isopropanol) although their presence is not normally required. It is also stated that when an organic solvent is required ethanol is preferred and that preferably, solutions are substantially free of organic solvents andVOCs. VOC isunderstood to mean Volatile Organic Compound According to WO 01/06036, the acyloxy silanes generally dissolve and hydrolyse readily and completely in water to produce organic acids, unlike the analogous alkoxy siianes which are said to produce alcohols on hydrolysis.<br>
The use of solvents is disadvantageous because it can cause problems of flammability of the solution. There remains a need for an alternative solution for coating metal surfaces.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided an aqueous composition consisting of:<br>
(i)      an alkylpolysao&amp;aride surfactant;<br>
(ii)     an alkoxyailane selected from the group consisting of -aminopropyl triethoxysilane and y -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane;<br>
(iii)    water,<br><br>
(iv)     optionally alcohol, solely from hydrolysis of the alkoxysilane; and<br>
(v)     optionally, one or more components selected from the group consisting of<br>
biocides, antifoams and adhesion promoters.<br>

(B)	drying me metal surface with the alkoxysilane deposited thereon, to produce on the<br>
metal surface a coating comprising a hydrophobia, interlocking network of covalent<br>
siloxane bonds.<br>
The present invention solves the technical problem defined above, by the use in an aqueous composition, of an alkyl polysaccharide surfactant in combination with one of two alkoxysilanes.<br>
The present invention does not require the metal surface to be coated with a silicate coating, for example such as described in US 5108793.<br>
The present invention does not require the use of a cross-Unking agent, for example such as described in US 5292549.<br>

The pH of the aqueous composition of me present invention is dependent upon the alkoxysilane used, - amino propyl triethoxysilane has tendency to hydrolyse at a pH of between 8 and 11 inclusive, y -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane has a tendency to hydrolyse at a pH of between 5.5 and 6.5 inclusive. Therefore, these two alkoxysilanes are not used together.<br>

The composition may be prepared by mixing the components together at ambient temperature.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the metal surface may be contacted with the composition by passing the metal surface through a bath containing the composition or by spraying (he composition onto (he metal surface. Spraying is preferred for an industrial scale method. The metal surface may be contacted with me composition for a contact time of 1 to 10second,preferably4to6seonds,for example 5 seconds. Preferably,the metal surface is contacted with the composition at a temperature of no greater than 60 °C, preferably at a temperature no greater man a maximum temperature inthe range 20 to 60 °C. Preferably, the metal surface is contacted with the composition for a contact time of 5 seconds at a temperature of 55 °C.<br><br>
In step (B) of the method of the present invention, the metal surface with the alkoxysilane deposited thereon, is dried to produce on the metal surface, a coating comprising a hydrophobic, interlocking network of covalent siloxane bonds.<br>
In step (B) the surface metal with the alkoxysilane deposited thereon, is preferably dried for a time period in me range 1 hour to 120 hours to produce on the metal surface, a coating comprising a hydrophobic, interlocking network of covalent siloxane bonds.<br>
In step (B) the surface metal deposited with alkoxysilane deposited thereon, is preferably dried at a temperature in the range IS to 100°C.<br>
Heating in step (B) is not essential but it reduces the drying time. Preferably, in step (B) the metal surface with me alkoxysilane deposited thereon, is heated at a temperature of 80 to 90 °C. Suitably, the metal surface may be heated in a furnace operating at a temperature of 80 to 90 °C, with the metal surface passing through at a rate to give a residence time of 1 to 60 minutes, preferably 3 .to 10 minutes, for example about 5 minutes.<br>
Suitable metal surfaces for coating with the composition hi the method of the present invention include carbon steel and galvanised steel. Suitably, the galvanised steel is hot dipped galvanised steel Examples of suitable galvanised steel are Zincanneal and Galvanneal. Compositions according to me present invention in which the alkoxysilane is  - amino propyl triethoxysilane are particularly suitable for use with carbon steel. Compositions according to the present invention in which the alkoxysilane is -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane are particularly suitable for use with galvanised steel.<br>
The invention will now be described by reference to the following examples and with reference to Figures 1 and 2 in which Figure 1 shows galvanised steel tubes on day 10 of a test and Figure 2 shows the surface of carbon steel on day 25 of a test<br>
It was found that without any surfactant present hi the compositions, it was not possible to apply a coating with the alkoxysilanes because the metal surfaces did not wet properly.<br>
Tests were performed with compositions comprising alkyl polysaccharide surfactant.<br><br>
Unpassivated, electrogalvanised rectangular steel tubes were used in their "as received" form.<br>
Prior to use, the metals were cleaned. For the majority of experiments, each galvanized steel tube was cleaned in an ultrasonic bam for 1 hour (to remove loose dirt and steel particles), allowed to dry, and then cleaned with n-heptane followed by acetone. The metal tubes were alkaline cleaned by the following steps: o   Soaking in aromatic hydrocarbon solvent for 15 minutes to remove any grease or<br>
oil that may be present on the metal surface; o   Cleaning in an ultrasonic bath (deionised water and Alkadet 1 5 surfactant) for 2-3<br>
minutes to loosen any particulates and were then rinsed under with tap water to<br>
remove any particulates;<br>
o   Dipping in 1% caustic soda or 3% sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), for S seconds; o   Rinsing with tap water; and o   Drying with a clean paper towel<br>
The alkaline cleaning was done to activate the hydroxy groups on the surface of the metal, which could increase adsorption of the silane on the surface and provide better film formation and increase rust protection.<br>
Contacting the motel surface with the composition and<br>
The composition was prepared by introducing to a mixing beaker in the following sequence : O.S % by weight Alkadet IS (trademark) surfactant; 3 %by weighty -glycidoxypropyl trimemoxysilane (Silquest A187 supplied by OE Silicones) and 96.5 % by weight deionised water. The components were mixed in the beaker and the resultant composition was set aside for use. The composition had a pH ranging 6.5 to 7.0.<br>
Since the thickness of the silane fihn was found not to be dependent on contact time, 5 seconds was chosen as a sufficient contact time between the composition and the metal<br><br>
Each dean, dry tube was clipped in the composition, up to halfway, for 5 seconds, and allowed to dry at room temperature (approximately 22°C) for 42-72 hours, unless otherwise specified. The top, un-coated, half of the galvanized steel tube acted as a control far rust testing.<br>
The drying step was found to produce an optimal coating comprising a hydrophobia, interlocking network of covalent siloxane bonds. Although 42-72 hours, at room temperature was a sufficient drying time, increased temperatures would decrease drying time.<br>
Corrosion testing:<br>
Corrosion testing was done using a test similar to the American Standard Test Method (ASTM) D1748, the Humidity Cabinet test, with the silane coated steel tubes being placed hi a closed, high humidity environment The test differed from the ASTM method in the use of sealed plastic containers instead of humidity cabinets and the use of a saturated copper sulphate slurry to provide the humidity instead of a bath as specified by ASTMD1748.<br>
The clean, coated galvanized steel tubes were sprayed with de-ionised water and stacked together in groups of four, secured with a rubber band (Some were stacked 1x4 and some were stacked 2x2). The stacked panels were placed in a sealed plastic container containing a saturated copper sulphate slurry, and the contact sides of the tubes were observed daily for the appearance of white rust (Those tubes stacked 2x2 had two contact sides). Every day mat there was no rust observed the tubes were re-sprayed with de-ionised water and testing continued.<br>
It was found that no rust was observed on the coated parts of the tubes on each of the first 9 days of the test. On the tenth day of the test, white rust was observed on the coated part of the tubes. Figure 1 is a photograph of test pieces showing the white rust on the upper (uncoated) parts of the tubes (control) and on the lower (coated) parts of the tubes on day 10 of the test<br><br>
Cold Rolled SteeL prepared at cold rolled steel<br>
Unpolished, Cold Rolled Steel (CRS) from ACT Laboratories Inc, Hillsdale, was cut into 10 cm by 2 cm panels, with a 5 mm hole drilled into the top of each panel lor<br>
hanging.<br>
Prior to contacting with the silane-containing composition, the CRS panels were cleaned thoroughly with n-heptane, allowed to dry, and were then cleaned with acetone until the surface .was "water-break free", which indicated that the surface was completely clean (water did not break around any dirt and/or oil on the surface).<br>
Contacting the metal surface with the compoosition and drying:<br>
The composition was prepared by introducing to a mixing beaker in the following sequence: 0.5 % by weight Alkadet 15 (trademark) surfactant; 3 % by weight y-amino propyl triethoxysilane (Silquest Al 10 supplied by GE Silicones, Dandenong) and 96.5 % by weight deionised water. The components were mixed in the beaker and the resultant composition was set aside for use. The composition had a pH ranging 8 to 11.<br>
Since the thickness of the silane film was found not'to be dependent on contact time, 5 seconds was chosen as a sufficient contact time.<br>
Bach dean, CRS panel was dipped in the composition, up to halfway, for 5 seconds, and allowed to dry at room temperature (approximately 22°C) for 22 hours, unless otherwise specified. The top, un-coated, half of the panel acted as a control for rust testing.<br>
The drying step was found to produce an optimal coating comprising a hydrophobic, interlocking network of covalent siloxane bonds. Although 22 hours, at room temperature was a sufficient drying time, increased temperatures would decrease drying time.<br>
Corrosion testing was done using a test similar to the American Standard Test Method (ASTM) D1748, the Humidity Cabinet test, with the silane coated sted tubes being placed in a dosed, high humidity environment The test differed from the ASTM<br><br>
method in the use of sealed plastic containers instead of humidity cabinets and the use of a saturated copper sulphate slurry to provide the humidity instead of a bath as specified by ASTMD1748.<br>
Bach silane-coated panel was hung vertically in a sealed plastic container, containing a saturated copper sulphate slurry, and was observed daily for the appearance of red rust The panels were not re-sprayed each day and there was no metal-to-metal contact (as there was with the tests for the galvanized steel tubes).<br>
It was found that the parts of the carbon steel panels which were coated according to the present invention remained without rust far better and much longer than the uncoated (control) steel. This is shown in Figure 2 which is a photograph of a steel panel on day 25 of the test The upper uncoated part of the panel has more rust than the lower coated part<br><br><br><br><br><br>
