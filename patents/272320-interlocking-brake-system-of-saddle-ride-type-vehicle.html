<br>
[Summary of Invention] <br>
[Technical Problem] <br>
[0004]<br>
Nevertheless, in a case where an operation force acting on a brake pedal is to be converted into an oil pressure and then transmitted to a rear wheel brake with a rod, it has been difficult to arrange a front end and a rear end of the rod substantially in the same position in the vehicle-width direction, and to arrange the rear end of the rod near the rear wheel brake, due to influences from parts constituting a mechanism for converting the operation force of the brake pedal to the oil pressure. <br>
<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above described situation. An object of the present invention is to provide an interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle, with which a front end and a rear end of a rod can be arranged at the same position in a vehicle-width direction, and the rear end of the rod can be arranged near a rear wheel brake, in a configuration that an operation force acting on a brake pedal is converted to an oil pressure, which is then transmitted to the rear wheel brake with the rod. [Solution to Problem] <br>
<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, a first aspect of the present invention is an interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle, which includes a rear wheel brake attached to a rear wheel pivotally supported by a swingarm swingably supported by a vehicle body frame, a front wheel brake attached to a front wheel, a brake pedal that is operable by a rider, thus causing the rear wheel brake and the front wheel brake to operate, and a master cylinder that outputs a hydraulic pressure in accordance with the operation performed on the brake pedal. The interlocking brake system includes: a slave cylinder that operates in accordance with a hydraulic pressure outputted from the master cylinder; a rod that mechanically transmits the output of the slave cylinder to the rear wheel brake; and a hydraulic pressure transmission path through which a hydraulic pressure outputted by the master cylinder is transmitted to the front wheel brake.  In the system, the rod is provided along the swingarm, and at least a part of the slave cylinder is arranged at a position overlapping the swingarm in a plan view. <br>
<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition to the configuration of the first aspect, a second aspect of the present invention is the interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle in which the master cylinder is provided to a casing fixed to the vehicle body frame at a position ahead of a support shaft with which a front end portion of the swingarm is swingably supported by the vehicle body frame, a cylinder body of the slave cylinder having an output rod is fastened to the casing with a front end portion of the output rod being arranged near the support shaft, the output rod having a front end portion thereof: coupled to a front end portion of the rod.<br>
<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the configuration of any one of the first and second aspects, a third aspect of the present invention is the interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle in which the vehicle body frame includes: a head pipe arranged on a front end thereof; a main frame extending downward to the rear from the head pipe; a pivot plate hanging downward from a rear portion of the main frame; paired left and right rear frames continuing to the rear portion of the main frame and extending upward to the rear; and a step holder having a pillion step and fixed to the pivot plate, and the casing is fixed to the step holder. <br>
<br>
<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the configuration of any one of the first to third aspects, a fourth aspect of the present invention is the interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle in whicli Llit: lud it. uiicinyed over Lhe swiagaiiii in a side view. <br>
<br>
[0010] In addition to the configuration of any one of the third and fourth aspects, a fifth aspect of the present invention is the interlocking brake system of a saddle-ride type vehicle in which the casing is provided with: a delay valve interposed in a middle of the hydraulic pressure transmission path so as to delay an operation of the front wheel brake inresponse to an operation of the brake pedal; and a shutoff valve that shuts off communication between the master cylinder and the slave cylinder when an output from the master cylinder transmitted to the slave cylinder side exceeds a predetermined value. <br>
<br>
[Advantageous Effects of Invention] <br>
[0011]<br>
According to the first aspect of the present invention, while the hydraulic pressure is outputted from the master cylinder in accordance with the operation performed on the brake pedal, and the output of the slave cylinder operating in accordance with the hydraulic pressure outputted from the master cylinder is mechanically transmitted to the rear wheel brake with the rod, the rod is provided along the swingarm, and at least a part of the slave cylinder is arranged to overlap the swingarm in a plan view.  This makes it possible to arrange the rear end of the rod near the rear wheel brake and arrange the front end and the rear end of the rod substantially in the same position in the vehicle-width direction, whereby efficiency in transmission of the force can be enhanced. <br>
<br>
[0012]<br>
Additionally, according to the second aspect of the present invention, the master cylinder is provided to the casing fixed to the vehicle body frame at a position ahead of the support shaft with which the swingarm is supported by the vehicle body frame, and the cylinder body of the slave cylinder is fastened to the casing with the front end portion of the output rod being arranged near the support shaft. This is beneficial because this makes it possible to arrange the distal end of the rod near the support shaft and thereby makes it difficult for a distance between the front end portion of the output rod to which the rod is coupxeu diiu L.ne rear wneei Drake to change due to swing of the swingarm; and thereby eliminating the need of separately providing a mechanism that absorbs changes in the distance changes otherwise caused by the swing.<br>
<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the third aspect of the present invention, the casing is firmly fixed to the step holder, and the need of having a dedicated member for supporting the casing is therefore eliminated, whereby increase in the number of parts can be avoided.<br>
<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the rod is arranged above the swingarm, whereby it is difficult for dust or the like, which is blown up from a road surface, to adhere to the rod.<br>
<br>
[0015]<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, the master cylinder, the delay valve and the shutoff valve are provided to the casing, whcrcby the master cylinder, the delay valve and the shutoff valve can be compactly arranged.<br>

<br>
[0024]<br>
In Fig. 2, a block-shaped casing 35 is attached to an inner surface side of the step holder 30 so as to be arranged at a position ahead of the support shaft 20 with which a front end portion of the swingarm 17 is swingably supported by the vehicle body frame F, and, while a master cylinder 36 that outputs a hydraulic pressure in accordance with an operation performed on the brake pedal 32 is provided to the casing 35, a cylinder body 40 of a slave cylinder 37 that operates in accordance with a hydraulic pressure outputted from the master cylinder 36 is fastened to the casing 35.  Additionally, to the casing 35, there are provided: a delay valve 38 that delays operation of the front wheel brake BF in response to an operation performed on the brake pedal 32; and a shutoff valve 39 interposed between the master cylinder 36 and the slave cylinder 37 so as to shut off communication between the master cylinder 36 and the slave cylinder 37 when an output from the master cylinder 36 transmitted to the rear wheel brake BR side exceeds a predetermined value. <br>
<br>
[0025]<br>
With reference to Fig. 3 in combination, the master cylinder 36 is formed by: having a master piston 43 slidably fitted into a first cylinder hole 41, which is provided to the casing 35 in a manner extending in the up-down direction with an upper end thereof being closed and having an lower end thereof opened, the master piston 43 forming an output hydraulic pressure chamber 42 between itself and an upper-end closed portion of the first cylinder hole 41: and having a first spring 4 4 disposed between the upper-end closed portion of the first cylinder hole 41 and the master piston 43. <br>
<br>
[0026]<br>
A spherical head portion 52a provided to one end portion of an input rod 52 extending in the up-down direction is connected to the master piston 4 3 so as to be capable of oscillating a head thereof, and first and second boots 53 and 54 arranged to overlap each other are provided between this outputting rod 52 and the casing 35. Additionally, a rear end portion of the brake pedal 32 is rotatably supported by a lower portion of the step holder 30 with a support shaft 55, and a top of a coupling arm portion 56 integrally continuing to a rear end portion of the brake pedal 32 and extending to the rear is coupled to the other end of the input rod 52 with a coupling pin 57, and, when the brake pedal 32 is stepped on, the master piston 43 is pushed up in a direction that causes the master piston 43 to reduce a cubic capacity of the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42, whereby a hydraulic pressure is outputted from the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42. <br>
<br>
[0027]<br>
The slave cylinder 37 is arranged in the cylinder body 40 so as to be capable of operating in a direction perpendicular to an operational axial line of the master cylinder 36, and is formed by: having a slave piston 60 slidably fitted into a second cylinder hole 58, which is provided to the cylinder body 4 0 in a manner including an end wall 58a at one end thereof and having an axial line perpendicular to an axial line of the first cylinder hole 41, the slave piston 60 forming an input hydraulic pressure chamber 59 between itself and the end wall 58a; and having a second spring 63 disposed between a ring-pane;! shaped retainer 62 and the slave piston 60, the retainer. 62 being supported, with a snap ring, by an opening portion of the second cylinder hole 58 at the other end thereof. <br>
<br>
[0028]<br>
Additionally, a spherical head portion 65a provided to a rear end of an output rod 65 extending in the front-rear direction is connected to the slave piston 60 so as to be capable of oscillating a head thereof, and a third boot 66 is provided between this output rod 65 and the casing 35. <br>
<br>
[0029]<br>
While one end of a rod 67 (refer to Figs. 1 and 2) that mechanically transmits an output of the slave cylinder 37 to the rear wheel brake BR is coupled to a front end portion of the output rod 65, this rod 67 is provided to extend from the output rod 65 to the rear, and the other end of the rod 67 is coupled to the lever 31 of the rear wheel brake BR. <br>
<br>
[0030]<br>
Accordingly, when the output rod 65 makes forward-moving operation as a hydraulic pressure acting upon the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59 moves the slave piston<br>
60 of the slave cylinder 37 in a direction that enlarges a cubic capacity of the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59, the lever 31 is driven with the rod 67 so as to turn, whereby the rear wheel brake BR makes braking operation. <br>
<br>
[0031]<br>
With reference to Fig. 4 in combination, the cylinder body 40 is configured to be fastened to an inner surface side of an upper portion of the casing 35, and an oil bolt 51 penetrating a collar 50 provided between the casing 35 and the cylinder body 40 is screwed with the upper portion of the casing 35. <br>
<br>
[0032]<br>
Accordingly, in a state where the cylinder body 40 is fastened to the casing 35, in a side view, the slave cylinder 37 is located above the swingarm 17 with the rod 67 being arranged above the swingarm 17, and, in a plan view, the rod 67 is arranged along the swingarm 17 while at least a part (in Example 1, the most part) of the slave cylinder 3   is arranged to overlap the sv/ingarm 17. Moreover, the slave cylinder 37 is fastened to the casing 35 while taking a posture sloping downward to the front so that a front end portion of the output rod 65 may be arranged near the support shaft 20 with which the swingarm 17 is swingably supported by the vehicle body frame F. <br>
<br>
[0033]<br>
Again with reference to Fig. 3, the delay bulb 38 is arranged in the casing 35 while being provided in a hydraulic pressure transmission path 68 through which a hydraulic pressure outputted from the master cylinder 36 is transmitted to the front wheel brake BF side, and the delay bulb 38 is formed by having a first piston 71, an annular first sheet member 72, a first end wall member 73 and a first valve spring 74 housed and arranged in a first housing hole 70 that is provided to the casing 35 so as to have an axial line parallel to the first cylinder hole 41 of the master cylinder 36. <br>
<br>
[0034]<br>
A communication hole 86, one end of which is made to communicate with the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42, is provided to the casing 35 so as to extend perpendicularly to the first cylinder hole 41; the first housing hole 70 is formed of a small-diameter hole portion 70a and a large-diameter hole portion 70b, the small-diameter hole portion 70a having an axial line that is parallel to the axial line of the first cylinder hole 41 and having one end thereof communicating with a middle portion of the communication hole 86, the large-diameter hole portion 70b having a larger diameter than the small-diametpr hoi fpnrin Oa and having one end thereof coaxially continuing to the other end of the small-diameter hole portion 70a; and the first side wall member 73 is liquid-tightly fitted and fixed to the other end portion of the large-diameter hole portion 70b in the first housing hole 70 so as to form a first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75 between itself and a step portion 70c formed between the small-diameter hole portion 70a and the large-diameter hole portion 70b. Additionally, an annular recessed portion 76 communicating with the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42 of the master cylinder 36 is provided to the step portion 70c.<br>
 <br>
[0035]<br>
The first piston 71 integrally includes a small-diameter portion 71a and a guide axis portion 71b, the small-diameter portion 71a slidably fitted into the small-diameter hole portion 70a of the first housing hole 70, the guide axis portion 71b coaxially continuing to the small-diameter portion 71a and being slidably fitted to the first end wall member 73.  Additionally, the first sheet member 72 is formed to be capable of shutting off the recessed portion 76 of the step portion 70c, and the first valve spring 74 that presses the first sheet member 72 against the step portion 70c is compressed and disposed between the first sheet member 72 and the first end wall member 73. <br>
<br>
[0036]<br>
Accordingly, when a hydraulic pressure of the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42 acts upon the small-diameter portion 71 of the first piston 71, the first piston 71 operates to separate, in the small diameter portion 71a, the first shppt member 72 from the step portion 70c to cause the recessed portion 76 to communicate with the first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75, and then, when the first sheet member 72 is separated from the step portion 70c in opposition to the spring force of the first valve spring 74, a hydraulic pressure of the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42 acts upon the first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75, whereby outputting of a hydraulic pressure from the first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75 is delayed in response to an operation performed on the brake pedal 32. <br>
<br>
[0037]<br>
The hydraulic pressure transmission path 68 is provided between the master cylinder 36 and the front wheel brake BF so as to include the first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75 and a tube path 77 such as a hose connecting the first intermediate hydraulic chamber 75 to the front wheel brake BF, and an opening-closing valve 78 is provJ.ded in the middle of the tube path 77. <br>
<br>
[0038]<br>
The shutoff valve 39 is arranged in the casing 35 so as to be provided between the output hydraulic pressure chamber 42 of the master cylinder 36 and the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59 of the slave cylinder 37, and is formed by having a second piston 81, an annular second sheet member 82, a second end wall member 8 3 and a second valve spring 84 housed and arranged in a second housing hole 80 that is provided to the casing 35 so as to have an axial line parallel to the first cylinder hole 41 of the master cylinder 36. <br>
<br>
[0039]<br>
The second housing hole 80 is formed of a small-diameter hole portion 80a and a large-diameter hole portion 80b, the small-diameter hole portion 80a having an axial line that is parallel to the axial line of the first cylinder hole 41 and having one end thereof communicating with the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59, the large-diameter hole portion 80b being formed to have a larger diameter than the small-diameter hole portion 80a and having one end thereof coaxially continuing to the other end of the small-diameter hole portion 80a; the second side wall member 83 is liguid-tightly fitted and fixed to the other end portion of the large-diameter hole portion 80b in the second housing hole 8 0 so as to form a second intermediate hydraulic chamber 8 5 between itself and a step portion 80c formed between the small-diameter hole portion 80a and the large-diameter hole portion 80b; and the other end of the communication hole 86 is opened to the second intermediate hydraulic chamber 85. <br>
<br>
[0040]<br>
The second sheet member 82 integrally includes an annular plate portion 82a, a lip portion 82b, and plural projecting portions 82c.  The annular plate portion 82a causes the step portion 80c to abut thereon with an inner peripheral edge portion of the step portion 80c protruding from the step portion 80c.  The lip portion 82b continues to an outer periphery of the annular plate portion 82a and comes into elastic contact with an inner surface of the large-diameter portion 80b.  The plural projecting portions 82c project from the annular plate portion 82a at an opposite side thereof to the step portion 80c, and are arranged at intervals in a circumferential dire-ction of the annular plate portion 82a. The second sheet member 82 is fitted into an end portion, at the step portion 80c side, of the large-diameter portion 80b. <br>
<br>
[0041]<br>
The second piston 81 is formed by having a small-diameter piston portion 81a, a large-diameter piston portion 81b and a coupling axis portion 81c that integrally continue to each other, the small-diameter piston portion 81a being movably inserted into the small-diameter hole portion 80a, the large-diameter piston portion 81b having a larger diameter than the small-diameter piston portion 81a, the coupling axis portion 81c having a smaller diameter than the piston portions 81a and 81b and coaxially coupling the both piston portions 81a and 81b to each other. <br>
<br>
[0042]<br>
The small-diameter piston portion 81a forms, between itself and an inner surface of the small-diameter hole portion 80a, an output chamber 87 communicating with the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59 of the slave cylinder 37 through the oil bolt 51, and is axially movably inserted into the small-diameter hole portion 80a. An annular valve portion 88, which shuts off communication between the second hydraulic pressure chamber 85 and the output chamber 87 by abutting on the annular plate portion 82a of the second sheet member 82 from the small-diameter hole portion 80a side, is provided to project on an outer periphery, at the second sheet member 82 side, of the small-diarnt l:er piston portion 81a. <br>
<br>
[0043]<br>
The large-diameter piston portion 81h is slidably fitted into the second end wall member 83. Additionally, a flange portion 81d jutting outward in the radial direction of the large-diameter piston portion 81b is provided to an end portion, at the coupling axis portion 81c side, of the large-diameter piston portion 81b, and the second valve spring 84 is compressed and disposed between the second end wall member 83 and the flange portion 81d. <br>
<br>
[0044]<br>
In such a shutoff valve 39, a hydraulic pressure outputted by the master cylinder 36 provides the second piston 81 with a hydraulic pressure opposing a spring force of the second valve spring 8.  Thereby, in a state where an output hydraulic pressure of the master cylinder 3 6 is low, the second piston 81 is supposed to have moved to a position where the second piston 81 separates the valve portion 88 from the second sheet member 82 by means of the spring force of the second valve spring 84, and thus the second hydraulic pressure chamber 85 communicates with the output chamber 87, namely, the input hydraulic pressure chamber 59 of the slave cylinder 37. However, when the output hydraulic pressure of the master cylinder 36 increases, the second piston 81 moves to a position where the second piston 81 causes the valve portion 88 to abut on the second sheet member 82 in opposition to the spring force of the second valve spring 84, whereby the shutoff valve 39 shuts off communication between the master cylinder 36 and the slave cylinder 37. <br>
<br>
[0045]<br>
Benefits of Example 1 described above will be described as follows.  While an output of the slave cylinder 37 that operates in accordance with a hydraulic pressure outputted by the master cylinder 36 that outputs the hydraulic pressure in accordance with an operation performed on the brake pedal 32 is transmitted to the rear wheel brake BR side with the rod 67, a part of the rod 67 and at least a part of the slave cylinder 37 are arranged in positions overlapping, in a plan view, the swingarm 17 pivotally supporting the rear wheel WR and being swingably supported by the vehicle body frame F, This makes it possible to arrange the rear end of the rod 67 near the rear wheel brake BR and to arrange the front end and the rear end of the rod 67 substantially in the same position in a vehicle-width direction, whereby efficiency in force transmission can be enhanced. <br>
<br>
[0046]<br>
Additionally, the master cylinder 36 is provided to the casing 35 fixed to the vehicle body frame F at a position ahead of the support shaft 20 with which the front end portion of the swingarm 17 is swingably supported by the vehicle body frame F, and the cylinder body 40 of the slave cylinder 37, which includes the output rod 65 whose front end portion is coupled to the front end portion of the rod 67, is fastened to the casing 35 with the front end portion of the output rod 65 being arranged near the support shaft 20.  This is beneficial because this makes it possible to arrange the distal end of the rod 67 near the support shaft 20 and thereby makes it difficult for a distance between the front end portion of the output rod 65 to which the rod 67 is coupled and the rear wheel brake to change due to swing of the swingarm 17; and thereby eliminating the need of separately providing a mechanism that absorbs changes in the distance changes otherwise caused by the swing. <br>
<br>
[0047]<br>
Additionally, the casing 35 is fixed to the step holder 30 constituting a part of the vehicle body frame F, whereby the need of a dedicated member for supporting the casing 35 can be eliminated, and an increase in the number of parts can be therefore avoided. <br>
<br>
[0048]<br>
Additionally, the rod 67 is arranged above the swingarin 17 in a side view, whereby it is difficult for dust or the like, which is blown up from a road surface, to adhere to the rod 67.<br>
<br>
[0049]<br>
Additionally, in addition to the master cylinder 36, the delay valve 38 that is interposed in the middle of the hydraulic pressure 62 so as to delay activation of the front wheel WF in response to an operation of the brake pedal 32, and the shutoff valve 39 that shuts off communication between the master cylinder 36 and the slave cylinder 37 when an output from the master cylinder 36 transmitted to the slave cylinder 37 side exceeds a predetermined value, are provided to the casing 35, whereby the master cylinder 36, the delay valve 38 and the shutoff valve 39 can be compactly arranged.<br>

Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment, and various design changes can be made thereto without departing from the present invention described in the scope of claims. <br>
