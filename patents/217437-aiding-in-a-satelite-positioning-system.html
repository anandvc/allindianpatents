Background of the Invention<br>
1.          Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
[001] This application is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/155,614, filed May 22, 2002,titled Search Domain Reducing Frequency Transfer<br>
in a Multi-mode Global Positioning System Used With Wireless Networks, which is a<br>
continuation-in-part of U.S.patent Application Serial No. 09/795,871, filed February<br>
28, 2001, titled Information Transfer in a Multi-mode Global Positioning System<br>
Used with Wireless Networks, now U.S. Patent No. 6,427,120, which claims priority<br>
under Section 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/225,076, filed<br>
August 14,2000,all of which are incorporated into this application by reference.<br>
2.         Field of Invention<br>
[002] The invention relates to Satellite Positioning System (SPS) receivers, and in<br>
particular to increasing the accuracy of SPS receivers by providing the receivers with<br>
information to correct for the frequency offset between the oscillators of the receivers<br>
and those of the satellites.<br>
3.         Related Art<br>
[003] Satellite Positioning System (SPS) receivers, such as Global Positioning<br>
System (GPS), also known as NAVSTAR, receivers, receive radio transmissions from<br>
satellite-based radio navigation systems and use those received transmissions to<br>
determine the location of the SPS receiver. The location of the SPS receiver may be<br>
determined by applying the well-known concept of intersection if the distances from<br>
the SPS receiver to three SPS satellites having known satellite locations.<br>
[004] Generally, each satellite in a satellite-based radio navigation system broadcasts<br>
a radio transmission, that contains its location information, and orbit information.<br>
More specifically, each of the orbiting satellites in the GPS system contains four<br>
highly accurate atomic clocks: two Cesium and two Rubidium. These clocks<br>
provide precision timing pulses used to generate two unique binary codes (also known<br>
as a pseudo random noise "PRN," or pseudo noise "PN" code) that are transmitted to<br>
earth. The PN codes identify the specific satellite in the constellation. The satellite<br>
also transmits a set of digitally coded ephemeris data that completely defines the<br>
precise orbit of the satellite. The ephemeris data indicates where the satellite is at any<br>
given time, and its location may be specified in terms of the satellite ground track in<br>
precise latitude and longitude measurements. The information in the ephemeris data<br>
is coded and transmitted from the satellite providing an accurate indication of the<br>
exact position of the satellite above the earth at any given time.<br>
[005] Although atomic clocks are very precise with a stability of about 1 to 2 parts<br>
in 1013 over a period of one day, a slight error (generally known as clock drift) may<br>
occur in the clocks over time resulting in satellite clock errors of about 8.64 to 17.28<br>
ns per day with corresponding range errors of 2.59 to 5.18 meters. In order to<br>
compensate for the error, the accuracy of the satellite atomic clocks are continuously<br>
monitored from ground stations in the GPS control system and any detected errors<br>
and drift in the clock of the satellites may be calculated and transmitted by the<br>
satellites as part of a navigation message in the form of three coefficients of a second-<br>
degree polynomial.<br>
[006] In the case of GPS, there is nominally a constellation of 24 operational<br>
satellites above the Earth. Bach satellite has individual PN codes, a nearly circular<br>
orbit with an inclination of 55Â° to the equator with a height of 10,898 nautical miles<br>
(20,200 kilometers) above Earth and an orbital period of approximately 12 hours.<br>
Each GPS satellite transmits a microwave radio signal composed of two carrier<br>
frequencies modulated by two digital codes and a navigation messages. The two<br>
carrier frequencies are referred to as the "LI" and "L2" carriers and are transmitted at<br>
1,572.42 megahertz (MHz) and 1,227.60 MHz, respectively. The two GPS codes are<br>
called the coarse acquisition (C/A-code) and precision (P-code). Each code consists<br>
of a stream of binary digits, zeros and ones, known as bits or "chips." Both the C/A-<br>
code and P-code are generally referred to as a PN code because they look like random<br>
noise-like signals. Presently, the C/A-code is modulated only on the LI carrier while<br>
the P-code is modulated on both LI and L2 carriers.<br>
[007] The C/A-code has a chipping rate of 1,023MHz because it is a stream of 1,023<br>
binary digits that repeats itself every millisecond. Each satellite is assigned a unique<br>
C/A-code, which enables a GPS receiver to identify which satellite is transmitting a<br>
particular code.   The C/A-code range measurement is relatively less precise when<br>
compared to the P-code but it is also less complex and available to all users. The P-<br>
code is mostly limited in use to the United States government and military.<br>
[008] Each satellite also transmits a GPS navigation message that is a data stream<br>
added to both the L1 and L2 carriers as binary bi-phase modulation at 50 kilo-bits per<br>
second (kbps). The navigation message contains, along with other information, the<br>
coordinates of the GPS satellites as a function of time, the satellite health status, the<br>
satellite clock corrections, the satellite almanac, and atmospheric data. Each satellite<br>
transmits its own navigation message with information on the other satellites, such as<br>
the approximate location and health status.<br>
[009] By receiving these radio signals emitted from the satellites;-a GPS receiver<br>
may calculate its distance from the satellite by determining how long it took the GPS<br>
receiver to receive the signal transmitted from the satellite. For example, a GPS<br>
receiver could calculate its two-dimensional position (longitude and latitude or X and<br>
Y) by determining its distance from three satellites. Similarly, the GPS receiver could<br>
calculate its three-dimensional position (longitude, latitude and altitude or X, Y and<br>
Z) by measuring its distance from four satellites.<br>
[0010] Unfortunately, this approach assumes that the distances measured from the<br>
GPS receiver to the satellites are very accurate and there is no bias error. In practice,<br>
however, the distance measured between the GPS receiver and each satellite typically<br>
has a constant unknown bias, because the GPS receiver clock (GPS-CLK) is usually<br>
different from the GPS satellite clocks. In order to resolve this bias error one more<br>
satellite transmission is typically needed to calculate the location of the GPS receiver.<br>
[0011] Generally, to receive the signals transmitted by the satellites, the GPS-CLK of<br>
the GPS receiver should be synchronized with that of the GPS satellites. Any errors<br>
in the synchronization between the clocks will cause inaccuracies the measurement of<br>
the location of the GPS receiver. Atomic clocks, like those found in the GPS<br>
satellites, are very expensive typically costing a few thousand dollars for a Rubidium<br>
clock and a few tens of thousands of dollars for a Cesium clock. They are therefore<br>
not practical for use in typical consumer GPS receivers. Inexpensive, less accurate<br>
clocks, such as, crystal clocks , are gengrally utilized in GPS receivers as GPS-CLKs.<br>
However, unless the inaccuracy of the GPS-CLK is determined and corrected for,<br>
synchronization with that of the atomic clocks of the satellites will be partially off and<br>
the resulting distance measurement calculated by the GPS receiver will be partially<br>
inaccurate. Thus, the error of the GPS-CLK is yet another unknown variable that<br>
must be determined to accurately determine the location of the GPS receiver.<br>
[0012] Besides accuracy, another problem associated with the error of the GPS-CLK<br>
relative to the GPS satellite clocks is the resulting acquisition time for the GPS<br>
receiver commonly known as the time to first fix (TTFF). For many applications,<br>
such as E911, a GPS receiver must be able to provide a position solution in a short<br>
period of time after the GPS receiver is powered on. Unfortunately, the GPS-CLK<br>
can have large frequency drift during the first couple minutes after being powered on.<br>
The large frequency drift can cause significant degradation on TTFF performance and<br>
may even result in lack of navigation fix in weak signal environments.<br>
[0013] In addition to the frequency drift in the GPS-CLK, there are a number of other<br>
factors that can affect TTFF performance. Although there are a large number of GPS<br>
satellites positioned above the earth"s atmosphere, it is not always possible for a GPS<br>
receiver to receive accurate transmissions from th required numher of GPS satellites<br>
necessary to calculate the position of the GPS receiver. Any number of problems may<br>
prevent a GPS receiver from receiving the necessary number of signals, or from<br>
receiving accurate signals because of transmission or receiver errors. These problems<br>
can result in high TTFF times.<br>
[0014] For example, a GPS receiver may not be able to receive the necessary number<br>
of GPS transmissions due to physical obstructions in the atmosphere or on the earth.<br>
Alternatively, even though a GPS receiver may be able to receive the necessary<br>
signals, the signal could be inaccurate due to any of the following: (i) error in the<br>
satellite clock; (ii) error in the receiver clock; (iii) error in computed satellite position;<br>
(iv) atmospheric errors caused by the ionosphere or the troposphere; (v) multipath<br>
errors caused by the receipt of reflective signals; (vi) receiver measuring errors and/or<br>
(vii) selective errors, or man made errors. These inaccuracies could lead to TTFF<br>
times that may be over thirty seconds because the GPS receiver needs to obtain the<br>
ephemeris data from the GPS system itself, and the GPS receiver typically needs a<br>
strong signal to acquire the ephemeris data reliably.<br>
[0015] Since the inception of GPS, methods have been, and are still being, developed<br>
to reduce errors and to enhance the accuracy of the GPS systems. Further, many<br>
different methods are being implemented to provide alternative means for providing<br>
the GPS receiver with information concerning unknown variables or inaccuracies in<br>
the system such that it is not always required for the system to receive satellite<br>
transmission signals from all the satellites or to receive accurate transmission data.<br>
[0016J One technique that has been introduced to assist with overcoming errors in the<br>
GPS system is differential GPS. With differential GPS, a receiver having a known<br>
location receives the GPS signals and calculates its position from the received signals.<br>
The calculated position is then compared to the actual known position of the receiver.<br>
The differential between the known position and the calculated position can then be<br>
used to calculate errors in the transmission signals. These errors can then be<br>
transmitted to receivers in unknown locations ("mobile receivers") and used by the<br>
mobile receivers to compute their own location with better accuracy.<br>
[0017] Differential GPS is typically used to correct for errors other than receiver or<br>
multipath errors. However, in a similar manner as differential GPS, correction data<br>
may be sent to the GPS receiver to correct for receiver errors. For example, one<br>
method that has been used to correct for errors in the GPS-CLK has been to send a<br>
precision carrier frequency signal to the GPS receiver from a second source, such as a<br>
base station. In this application, the GPS receiver is designed to receive the precision<br>
carrier frequency signal and then calibrate and/or lock the GPS-CLK to that of the<br>
precision carrier frequency. This method, however, typically involves the use of<br>
additional complicated circuitry that first locks and/or calibrates the GPS-CLK to the<br>
precision carrier frequency and then maintains dynamic synchronization between the<br>
GPS-CLK and precision carrier frequency.<br>
[0018] A need therefore exists for a method of compensating for errors created by the<br>
drift of the GPS-CLK to increase positional accuracy and improve TTFF in a dynamic<br>
manner without utilizing additional complex circuitry and without significantly<br>
modifying the existing hardware.<br>
Summary<br>
[0019] The invention relates to aiding a Global Positioning System (GPS) subsystem<br>
within a wireless device. The wireless device includes a wireless processing section<br>
capable of receiving signals from a wireless network and a GPS subsystem having a<br>
radio frequency (RF) front-end capable of receiving a GPS satellite signal. The<br>
wireless processing section of the wireless device receives an external clock and<br>
determines the offset between the clock in the wireless processing section and that of<br>
the external clock. The GPS subsystem then receives the offset information from the<br>
wireless processing section, information related to the nominal frequency of the<br>
wireless processing section clock and the wireless processing section clock.. Using<br><br>
this information and the GPS clock in the GPS subsystem, the GPS subsystem<br>
determines an acquiring signal, which is related to a frequency offset between the<br>
GPS clock and the network clock. The GPS subsystem then acquires GPS satellite<br>
signals in an acquiring unit though the use of the acquiring signal.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0035) FIG. 1 is an example implementation of a GPS system 100 using a wireless<br>
device 102 having a GPS receiver (not shown) located within the wireless device 102.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, during operation, the wireless device 102 is in signal<br>
communication with a wireless network 104 via a basestation 106 and wireless<br>
transmission path 108 and is in signal communication with at least one satellite of the<br>
GPS satellite constellation 110 via signal communication path 112.<br>
[0036] The wireless device 102 includes both a GPS receiver (not shown) and a<br>
wireless processing section (not shown). The GPS receiver within the wireless device<br>
102 may receive GPS signals from the GPS satellite constellation 110 via signal<br>
communication path 112 and the wireless processing section of the wireless device<br>
102 may receive wireless communication signals from the wireless network 104 via<br>
signal communication path 108 and base station 106. In some implementations, the<br>
wireless device 102 may also send wireless communication signals to the wireless<br>
network 104 via signal communication path 108 and base station 106. The wireless<br>
device 102 may be a wireless handset such as a cellular telephone (also known as a<br>
cellphone, mobile telephone or mobile phone) or any other type of mobile device,<br>
including, but not limited to, personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, computer,<br>
two-way radio, trunked radio, specialized mobile radio (SMR) or any other device for<br>
which it is desirable to determine location information. In the case of a cellular<br>
telephone, the wireless device 102 may utilize a cellular transceiver that operates at<br>
any radio frequency (RF) band utilizing any transmission schemes including but not<br>
limited to CDMA, CDMA-2000, W-CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, GSM, UMTS, AMPS,<br>
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and/or any combination or extension of these transmission schemes<br>
or similar schemes.<br>
[0037] FIG. 2 is an example implementation of a block diagram of the wireless device<br>
102 shown in FIG. 1. As seen in FIG. 2, the wireless device 102 includes both a<br>
wireless processing section 200 and a GPS subsystem 202. The wireless processing<br>
section 200 performs the processing functions for the wireless applications and may<br>
include a wireless transceiver. For example, in the case of a cellular telephone, the<br>
wireless device 102 would include a call processing section with a cellular<br>
transceiver. The GPS subsystem includes a GPS receiver (not shown) for receiving<br>
satellite transmissions 204 from satellites 205 and a GPS engine (not shown) that<br>
performs the position computation functions for the wireless device 102. By<br>
integrating the technology of the wireless device 102 with that of the GPS subsystem<br>
202, the wireless device 102 provides two major service systems: that of a wireless<br>
device, such as cellular telephone service, and that of the GPS receiver to provide<br>
location information of the wireless device 102. It is appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art; that this integration provides for numerous advantages including meeting the<br>
E911 requirements of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).<br>
[0038] Within the wireless device 102, or, alternatively, between the wireless device<br>
102 and an external accessory device (not shown) to the wireless device 102,<br>
communications between the wireless processing section 200 and GPS subsystem 202<br>
take place. These communications allow signals to be transferred from the wireless<br>
processing section 200 to GPS section 202, and may take place on a serial or parallel<br>
communications link 206 (such as RS-232 serial communication link) and hardware<br>
lines 208, but other connections may be also utilized if desired.<br>
[0039] For example, in another example implementation, the wireless processing<br>
section 200 and the GPS subsystem 202 may share the same digital processor (not<br>
shown) and/or other circuitry, In such a case, the communication between the<br>
wireless processing section 200 and the GPS subsystem 202 may be made by inter-<br>
task communication, and certain data transfers, such as any time or frequency<br>
transfers between the wireless processing section 200 and the GPS subsystem 202,<br>
would not use hardware lines 208, but would be internal to the circuitry or,<br>
potentially, no transfer would be required depending on the circuit design.<br>
[0040] As illustrated by FIG. 2, the GPS satellites 205 transmit spread spectrum<br>
signals 204 that are received at the wireless device 102. For purposes of illustration,<br>
satellite 205 represents a constellation of satellites 205 in the GPS system. If the<br>
wireless device 102 is capable of receiving strong enough signals 204, the GPS<br>
subsystem 202 in the wireless device 102 can compute the position of the wireless<br>
device 102 as is typically done in a standalone GPS system. Oftentimes, however, the<br>
GPS subsystem 202 is not able to receive strong enough signals 204, or is not able to<br>
receive signals 204 from enough available GPS satellites 205 to autonomously<br>
compute the position of the wireless handset 102. This results in high time to first fix<br>
(TTFF) values. The wireless devices 102 may still, however, be able to communicate<br>
to the base station 106, Thus, the base station 106 can communicate information via<br>
signals 108 to wireless device 102 that allow the wireless device 102 to improve its<br>
TTFF and compute its location, or in certain applications (although not required for<br>
the implementation of the invention) to communicate information from the wireless<br>
device 102 to the base station 106, to allow a server (not shown) at the wireless<br>
network 104, in signal communication with the base station 106, to compute the<br>
position of the wireless device 102. When the base station 106 transmits information<br>
to the wireless device 102 to allow the wireless device 102 to compute its position, it<br>
is typically known as "aided GPS."<br>
[0041] As further illustrated by FIG. 2, the base station 106 and both the wireless<br>
processing section 200 and the GPS subsystem 202 of the wireless device 102 have<br>
internal clocks that are produced by internal clock circuits. For illustrative purposes,<br>
the clock of the wireless processing section 200. shall be referred to as the "WPS-<br>
CLK" 210 and the clock of the GPS subsystem 202 shall be referred to as the "GPS-<br>
CLK" 212. Typically, the WPS-CLK 210 and GPS-CLK 212 are inexpensive clocks<br>
produced by crystal oscillators that are not highly accurate when compared to the<br>
atomic clocks of the GPS satellites 205. Thus, to reduce the TTFF and accurately<br>
calculate the position of the wireless device 102, the error in the GPS-CLK 212<br>
should be accounted for. In contrast to the WPS-CLK 210:and GPS-CLK 212, the<br>
base station 106 clock is a highly accurate. In the case of a CDMA wireless network,<br>
the base station 106 clock would be synchronized with the atomic clocks of the GPS<br>
satellites 205. For purposes of illustration, this base station 106 clock shall be"<br>
referred to as the "BS-CLK" 214 or the "Standard Clock" (STD-CLK) 214. In<br>
operation, the STD-CLK 214 is transmitted, via signal communication path 108, to<br>
the wireless processing section 200 of wireless handset 102. As explained in more<br>
detail below, the wireless processing section 200 of the wireless handset 102<br>
calculates a first offset value (referred to as "STD-WPS-OFFSET") that corresponds<br>
to the difference in frequency between the STD-CLK 214 and that WPS-CLK 210.<br>
r<br>
The STD-WPS-OFFSET is then communicated to the GPS subsystem 202, which<br>
uses the STD-WPS-OFFSET, along with WPS-CLK 210 and GLS-CLK 212 to<br>
estimate a second offset value (referred to as "GPS-STD-OFFSET") between the<br>
GPS-CLK 212 and that of the STD-CLK 214. The GPS-STD-OFFSET is then<br>
utilized by the GPS subsystem 202 to acquire the received GPS signals from the GPS<br>
satellites 204.<br>
[0042] FIG. 3 is general block diagram of an offset circuit 300 within the GPS<br>
subsystem 202 shown in FIG. 2 for generating GPS-STD-OFFSET. The offset circuit.<br>
300 may include an offset counter 302 and an offset combiner 304 in signal<br>
communication with the offset counter 302. The offset circuit 300 is in signal<br>
communication with a wireless sub-processor 306 located in the wireless processing<br>
section 200. The wireless sub-processor 306 receives the STD-CLK 214 and WPS-<br>
CLK 210, and in response produces a WPS initialization message that includes<br>
information about the nominal frequency (referred to as "N-WPS-CLK") of the WPS-<br>
CLK 210 and a WPS periodic message that includes information about the STD-<br>
WPS-OFFSET. The N-WPS-CLK information is passed to the offset counter 302 via<br>
first offset bus 308 and the STD-WPS-OFFSET is passed to the offset combiner 304<br>
via the second offset bus 310. The offset counter 302 receives the N-WPS-CLK<br>
information via first bus 308, GPS-CLK 212 and WPS-CLK 210. In response, the<br>
offset counter 302 generates an offset signal (or message) that includes information<br>
about the difference in frequency between WPS-CLK 210 and GPS-CLK 212<br>
(referred to as "GPS-WPS-OFFSET") and passes that offset signal to the offset<br>
combiner 304 via third offset bus 312. The offset combiner 304 then combines the<br>
information for the STD-WPS-OFFSET and GPS-WPS-OFFSET and produces the<br>
Â¦v<br>
STD-GPS-OFFSET which is passed to the rest of the GPS subsystem 202 via<br>
message bus (or signal path) 314.<br>
[0043] FIG. 4 illustrates a basic block diagram of the GPS subsystem 202 of FIG. 2.<br>
In FIG. 4, the GPS subsystem 202 includes the GPS-CLK 212 and a GPS processor<br>
section 400 that receives at least one signal from the wireless processing section 200<br>
via signal bus 402. The wireless processing section 200 receives communication data<br>
from the wireless network 104 (FIG. 1) including STD-GLK 214 (FIG. 2): The<br>
wireless processing section 200 then generates the STD-WPS-OFFSET message that<br>
represents the frequency difference between the WPS-LO 210 and the STD-CLK 214.<br>
The STD-WPS-OFFSET message is transferred to the GPS processor section 400 via<br>
signal bus 402. The GPS processor section 400, in response to receiving the STD-<br>
WPS-OFFSET and the GPS-CLK 212, generates a STD-GPS-OFFSET that assists in<br>
the acquiring of the received GPS satellite signals when input into an acquiring unit<br>
(not shown) within the GPS processor section 400.<br>
[0044] FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an example implementation of the GPS processor<br>
section 400 of FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 5, the GPS processor section 400 may<br>
include a radio frequency (RF) front-end 500, GPS clock processor 502, GPS code<br>
and carrier generator 504, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 506 and acquiring unit<br>
508. A GPS frequency source 510 sends a frequency reference to the RF front-end<br>
500, GPS code and carrier generator 504 and ADC 506. The RF front-end 500 may<br>
be a standard GPS RF front-end. In operation, the RF front-end 500 receives the GPS<br>
satellite signals and demodulates (also known as downconverting) them to remove the<br>
carrier frequency from the data transmitted on the GPS satellite signals. The<br>
demodulation is accomplished by mixing the received GPS satellite signals with the<br>
GPS frequency source 510. The resulting demodulated GPS satellite signals are then<br>
passed from the RF front-end 500 to the ADC 506. At the ADC 506, the demodulated<br>
GPS satellite signals are typically digitized into a bit-stream of samples by a number<br>
of well-known sampling techniques. The resultant bit-stream of samples is then<br>
transferred to the acquiring unit 508. It is appreciated by one skilled in the art that the<br>
GPS frequency source 510 may be a local oscillator (LO) (not shown) that includes a<br>
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) (not shown) or voltage-controlled crystal<br>
oscillator (VCXO) (not shown) in a phase-locked loop (PLL) (not shown) that is<br>
locked to GPS-CLK 212 by many well known techniques.<br>
[0045] The acquiring unit 508 receives the bit-stream of samples from the ADC 506<br>
finishes demodulating the bit-stream of samples (if the RF front-end 500 only<br>
downconverted the received satellite signals into an intermediate frequency "IF") and<br>
decodes it by typically utilizing a bank of correlators (not shown) or a matched filter<br>
(not shown). If the acquiring unit 508 downconverts the bit-stream of samples from<br>
the IF frequency, the acquiring unit 508 may have a mixing stage that mixes a<br>
Doppler corrected frequency signal from the GPS code and carrier generator 504 with<br>
the bit-stream of samples. The result from the mixer would be a new bit-stream of<br>
samples corrected for carrier Doppler shift.<br>
[0046] The correlators or matched filter correlate the bit-stream of samples from the<br>
ADC 506 with the different satellite codes PN codes. The acquiring unit 508<br>
produces a detection signal when the corresponding PN code of a satellite is<br>
correlated against the bit-stream samples of the received satellite signal.<br>
[0047] The PN codes are produced by the GPS code and carrier generator 504. The<br>
GPS code generator 504 may include a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) (not<br>
shown) that produces a PN code and other circuitry (not shown) that corrects for<br>
Doppler shift both for the carrier and code. The GPS clock processor 502 is capable<br>
of determining the STD-GPS-OFFSET. Once the STD-GPS-OFFSET has been<br>
generated by the GPS clock processor 502, it is passed to the GPS code and carrier<br>
generator 504. The GPS code and carrier generator 504 then combines the STD-GPS-<br>
OFFSET with the corrections for Doppler shift and utilizes the combined result to<br>
remove the IF carrier and produce the PN codes for the acquiring unit 508.<br>
[0048] The GPS code and carrier generator 504 attempts to correct the effects of<br>
Doppler shift in both the carrier and the code of the received satellite signal. In<br>
general, satellite motion has an impact on the processing of the signals at the GPS<br>
receiver because the input frequency shifts as a result of the Doppler effect. The<br>
satellite motion causes a Doppler frequency shift on the carrier frequency and on the<br>
coarse/acquisition (C/A) code. The angular velocity and speed of the satellite can be<br>
calculated from the approximate radius of the satellite orbit and is approximately<br>
1.458 x 10-4 radians/second and 3,874 meters/second. The Doppler frequency shift is<br>
caused by the satellite velocity component toward the GPS receiver. Typically, the<br>
maximum Doppler velocity occurs when the satellite is at the horizon position and<br>
from the orbit speed the maximum Doppler velocity along the horizontal direction is<br>
approximately 2,078 miles per hour. This speed is equivalent to a high-speed military<br>
aircraft. Therefore, the Doppler frequency shift caused by a land vehicle is often very<br>
small, even if the motion is directly toward the satellite to produce the highest<br>
Doppler effect. For the L1 frequency, which is modulated by the C/A signal, the<br>
maximum Doppler frequency shift is approximately 4.9 KHz. Therefore, for a<br>
stationary observer, the maximum Doppler frequency shift is around Â± 5 KHz. To<br>
create a Doppler frequency shift of Â± 5 KHz by the vehicle alone, the vehicle must<br>
move toward the satellite at about 2,078 miies/hour. As such, if me GPS receiver is<br>
used in a low-speed vehicle, the Doppler shift can be approximated as Â± 5KHz.<br>
[0049] FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example implementation of the GPS frequency<br>
source 510 of FIG. 5. The GPS frequency source 510 may include the GPS-CLK 212<br>
and a PLL 600. It is appreciated that typically the GPS-CLK 212 may be produced by<br>
a timing circuit (not shown) with a crystal oscillator 602. The PLL 600 may be<br>
implemented by a number of approaches that are well known to one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art. As an example, the basic components of the PLL 600 include a phase<br>
detector (not shown), a loop filter (not shown) and a VCO (not shown) whose<br>
frequency is controlled by an external voltage and that is locked on to frequency of<br>
the GPS-CLK 212. In this example implementation, the GPS carrier and code<br>
generator 504 and the GPS clock processor 502 use the GPS-CLK 212 as the base<br>
reference and generate their own respective frequencies. The RF front-end 500 and<br>
ADC 506 use the frequency from the PLL 600 because they are typically related in a<br>
synchronous manner or use frequency values that are multiples of one another.<br>
[0050] FIG. 7 is a simplified block diagram of an example implementation of the GPS<br>
RF front-end 500 utilizing direct conversion. The RF front-end 500 may include an<br>
antenna 700 and a mixer 702. The mixer 702 is in signal communication with the<br>
PLL 600 and ADC 506. The mixer 702 is basically multiplier that demodulates (or<br>
downconverts, i.e., removes the carrier frequency signal) a received satellite signal, on<br>
signal path 704, by taking a product of the received satellite signal with the frequency<br>
signal provided by the PLL 600. If the frequency of the received satellite signal<br>
carrier 704 and the frequency of the PLL 600 are synchronous, i.e., are of the same<br>
frequency, the output of the mixer is a direct current (DC) component signal with a<br>
second order harmonic that may be filtered out with a low pass filter (not shown).  As<br>
an example, if the signal on signal path 704 is "x(t)cos(wt)" where "w" is the angular<br>
frequency and "wt" is the time, and the PLL 600 produces a demodulation signal 606 of<br>
"cos(wt)" that is fed into the mixer 702, the resulting output 708 of the mixer would<br>
bex(t)cos2(wt) which equals x(t)/2 (l + cos(2wt)) or x(t)/2+cos(2wt)/2<br>
[0051] If the frequency of the received satellite signal carrier 704 and the frequency<br>
of the PLL 600 are not synchronous, then there is no DC component. As another<br>
example, if the signal on the signal path 704 is "x(t)cos(wt)" and the PLL 600<br>
produces a demodulation signal 606 "cos(w1t)" the resulting output 608 of the mixer<br>
would be x(t)cos(wt) cos(w1t). If "w1"is close to w but off by a small amount "??"<br>
the relationship may be represented as ? = ?1 Â± ??. In this case, x(t)cos(?t) cos(?1t)<br>
would equal x(t)cos(?t) cos(?t Â±??t), This problem may be overcome by adjusting<br>
the frequency of the PLL 600 to be synchronous with the satellite signal carrier<br>
frequency. Adjusting for frequency at the PLL 600 does not, however, account for<br>
Doppler shift, which also affects the perceived frequency of the received satellite<br>
carrier signal in a dynamic fashion. Rather than correcting for frequency at the<br>
demodulating stage at the RF-front end, the correction could be made at the acquiring<br>
stage, i.e., at the acquiring unit 508, which would include the correction for Doppler<br>
shift.<br>
[0052] FIG. 8 illustrates a simple block diagram of an example implementation of the<br>
acquiring unit 508. At the acquiring unit 508 the Doppler shift error and PLL 600 are<br>
corrected by an adjustment in the GPS code and carrier generator 504 and in a change<br>
in frequency generated by the PLL 600. The acquiring unit 508 may include a<br>
plurality of correlators or matched filters. For simplicity, the acquiring unit 508 is<br>
illustrated with one correlator 800, however it is appreciated by one skilled in the art<br>
that numerous banks of correlators will most likely be present. In operation, the<br>
acquiring unit 508 receives from the ADC 506 a bit-stream of samples possibly<br>
corresponding to a received satellite signal. The acquiring unit 508 places the bit-<br>
stream of samples into a bank of correlators or matched filters and receives a PN code<br>
from the GPS code and carrier generator 504. The PN code is then shifted through<br>
the bank of correlators and an output is produced that signifies when a satellite signal<br>
has been received by the wireless device 102. Typically, the PN code received from<br>
the GPS code and carrier generator 504 has been adjusted to compensate for any<br>
Doppler shift for the respective satellites. However, in this situation the GPS code<br>
and carrier generator 504 and the PLL 600 has also compensated for any frequency<br>
errors in the GPS-CLK 212.<br>
[0053] FIG. 9 shows a block diagram of another example implementation of the RF<br>
front-end 900 and the acquisition unit 902, which is in signal communication with the<br>
RF front-end 900 via the ADC 904. In this example, the RF front-end 900 is a multi-<br>
stage receiver that first downconverts a received satellite signal at the antenna 906 to<br>
an intermediate frequency (IF) signal 908, such as 96 KHz, via mixer 910 and then to<br>
a baseband (i.e., demodulate to zero) signal 912 via mixer 914. The baseband signal<br>
912 may then be passed through the ADC 904 to the acquisition unit 902. In the<br>
acquisition unit 902, the ADC sample baseband signal is corrected for Doppler carrier<br>
shift via mixer 916 and passed to a bank of correlators 918 or a matched filter (not<br>
shown). The frequency sources 918 and 920 may be produced by frequency generator<br>
922 that either multiplies or divides (in any one of many well known techniques) the<br>
frequency signal produced by the PLL 924 which is locked to the GPS-CLK 212.<br>
Similarly, the GSP carrier and code generator 926, which utilizes the GPS-CLK 212,<br>
may produce signals 928 and 930 that compensate for the carrier Doppler shift and<br>
drive the correlators 918 or matched filer (not shown).<br>
[0054] FIG. 10 shows a block diagram for yet another example implementation of the<br>
RF front-end 1000 and the acquisition unit 1002, which is in signal communication<br>
the RF front-end 1000 via the ADC 1004. In this example the RF front-end 1000 only<br>
has mixer stage. The received satellite signal is received at antenna 1006 and mixed<br>
with an IF frequency 1008 at mixer 1010. The IF frequency 1008 is produced by<br>
frequency generator 1012 and it mixes with the received satellite signal in mixer 1010<br>
to downconvert the received satellite signal to an intermediate downconverted signal<br>
1014 such as 96 KHz. The intermediate downconverted signal 1014 is passed through<br>
the ADC 1004 to the acquisition unit 1002. The ADC 1004 digitizes the intermediate<br>
downconverted signal in a bit-stream of samples and passes it to the acquisition unit<br>
1002. At the acquisition unit 1002, the bit-stream of samples are feed into a second<br>
mixer 1016 which mixes the samples with a carrier Doppler corrected signal 1018<br>
which produces a downconverted bit-stream of samples that have been corrected for<br>
carrier Doppler shift. The output of mixer 1016 is feed into a bank of correlators<br>
1020 or matched filters and produces a detection signal if a satellite has been<br>
acquired. As before, the frequency generator 1012 is related to the PLL frequency<br>
1026 and both the PLL and GPS carrier and code generator 1022 are related to tlie<br>
GPS-CLK212.<br>
[0055] FIG. 11 shows a block diagram for an example implementation of the GPS<br>
carrier and code generator 504. The GPS carrier and code generator 504 may include<br>
a Doppler prediction model 1100, an offset combiner 1102, a NCO register 1104 and<br>
a NCO 1106. In operation, the Doppler prediction model 1100 produces a number of<br>
Doppler correction values that are combined with the STD-GPS-OFFSET. These<br>
correction values are input into the NCO register 1104 that controls the NCO 1106.<br>
The NCO 1106 then sends the Doppler corrected carrier signal and PN code to the<br>
acquisition unit 508.<br>
[0056] FIG. 12 shows a block diagram of an example implementation of the GPS<br>
clock processor 502. The GPS clock processor 502 may include an offset counter<br>
1200 and an offset combiner 1202. As an example, the offset counter 1200 may<br>
receive a signal 1204 from the GPS-CLK 212 and at least one signal 1212 from the<br>
Wireless processing section 200.   The offset counter 1200 then produces an offset<br>
signal that represents GPS-WPS-OFFSET. The offset signal may be transmitted as a<br>
message via signal path 1206 to the offset combiner 1202. The offset combiner 1202<br>
then combines the information from the offset signal received, via signal path 1206,<br>
with a message received from the wireless processing section 200, via signal path<br>
1208, that represents STD-WPS-OFFSET. The output of the offset combiner 1202 is<br>
an offset signal 1210 that represents STD-GPS-OFFSET. This offset signal 1210 is<br>
input into the combiner 1102 of FIG. 11.<br>
[0057] As an example of operation, the offset counter 1200 is utilized to measure the<br>
relative frequency offset between the WPS-CLK 210 and GPS-CLK 212. A gate<br>
signal to the offset counter 1200 may be generated by the GPS-CLK 212 via signal<br>
path 1204. The pulse width, which may also be referred to as gate time, is determined<br>
by counting a fixed number of GPS-CLK 212 clock pulses. The offset counter 1200<br>
also receives, via signal path 1212, the WPS-CLK 210. The offset counter 1200 then<br>
counts the pulses from the WPS-CLK 210 clock during the gate time. In general, the<br>
offset counter 1200 should count number WPS-CLK 210 clock pulses (the "predicted<br>
count" or "count predicted") to be equal to the frequency of the WPS-CLK 210<br>
multiplied by the gate time or in other words: count_ predicted = frequency x<br>
gate_time.<br>
[0058] For example, the offset counter 1200 should accumulate 25 million pulses<br>
from a frequency source, such as an oscillator, with a hypothetical WPS-CLK 210<br>
frequency of 25 MHz during a one-second interval. Therefore, a frequency offset<br>
(freq offset) may be determined as the quantity of the actual count reading<br>
(count reading) minus the count predicted, the quantity divided by product of the<br>
WPS-CLK 210 frequency by the gate time. Written as a mathematical relationship<br>
the frequency offset is: freq offset = (count reading - count predicted) / (frequency<br>
x gate time).<br>
[0059J It is appreciated by those of skill in the art, that in order to compute the<br>
predicted count, one needs the nominal GPS-CLK 212 and WPS-CLK 210 clock<br>
frequencies. The GPS-CLK 212 clock frequency is imposed via signal path 1204. To<br>
avoid a compilation time parameter in the GPS subsystem 202 source code, the<br>
wireless processing section 200 specifies the WPS-CLK 210 nominal frequency.<br>
Typically this is done by sending a periodic frequency calibration message that<br>
includes the WPS-CLK 210 nominal frequency parameter, N-WPS-CLK, from the<br>
wireless processing section 200 to"the offset counter"1200 via signal path 1214. The<br>
GPS clock processor 502 may then compute the relative frequency error without prior<br>
knowledge of the WPS-CLK 210 clock characteristics.<br>
[0060] To reduce the complexity of the offset counter 1200 hardware, the overall<br>
counting range of the offset counter 1200 may be much smaller than the total counting<br>
number, provided that the offset counter 1200 counts modulo its range, and its value<br>
range is smaller than the total range of the offset counter 1200. For example, if the<br>
total range is 5 parts per million (ppm), the WPS-CLK 210 frequency is 20 MHz, and<br>
the gating time is 1 second, the offset counter 1200 range may be as small as 5e"6<br>
times 20e6= 100.<br>
[0061] The difference between the predicted count and the actual count reading is<br>
utilized to compute the GPS-CLK 212 frequency offset as follows. First, the<br>
difference between the predicted count and the actual count is not only due to the<br>
WPS-CLK 210 frequency error (dfwps-lo), but also to the gate time error and offset<br>
counter 1200 resolution. Supposing the offset counter 1200 gate time is t seconds that<br>
is controlled by the GPS-CLK 212 clock, the error of gate time (dt) caused by the<br>
GPS-CLK 212 clock frequency (dfgps-lo) is dt = dfgps-lo x t. Then, the freq offset =<br>
dfwps-lo + dfgps-lo + counting error/(t xfwps-lo).<br>
[0062] The value that the offset counter 1200 measures is (dfgps-lo + dfwPs-lo)-<br>
Theoretically, the GPS-CLK 212 clock cannot be calibrated better than WPS-CLK<br>
210 clock and extending the gate time may improve the measurement accuracy of<br>
(dfgps-lo + dfwps-lo)- However, using too long a gate time is typically impractical.<br>
Therefore, the minimum gate time is generally predetermined such that the relative<br>
frequency offset estimate error is within the desired design limits.<br>
[0063] FIG. 13 is a flow chart illustrating the process performed by the GPS<br>
subsystem 200. The process begins 1300 by GPS clock processor 502, FIG. 5,<br>
receiving 1302, FIG. 13, GPS-CLK, WPS-CLK and STD-WPS-OFFSET. Then the<br>
GPS clock processor 502 determines the GPS-WPS-OFFSET and combines 1306 the<br>
GPS-WPS-OFFSET with STD-WPS-OFFSET to generate STD-GPS-OFFSET. The<br>
STD-GPS-OFFSET is then passed to the GPS carrier and code generator 504 where<br>
the STD-GPS-OFFSET is combined 1308 with Doppler prediction to create a<br>
correction signal. The correction signal is used to adjust 1310 the NCO in the GPS<br>
carrier and code generator. The NCO output, is then feed 1312 into the acquisition<br>
unit 508 and in response the acquisition unit acquires 1314 a received satellite signal<br>
using the correction signal. The process then ends 1316.<br>
[0064] The process in FIG. 14 may be performed by hardware or software. If in<br>
hardware, the process may be performed by a controller (not shown) in either the<br>
wireless processing section 200 or GPS processor section 400. The controller may<br>
selectively be any general-purpose processor such as an Intel XXX86, Motorola<br>
68XXX or PowerPC, or other equivalent or GPS and/or cellular specialized processor<br>
capable of running software instructions (not shown) resident on the controller.<br>
Alternatively, a GPS-specific circuit or oriented device may selectively also be<br>
utilized. It is appreciated that the controller may also be selectively integrated into a<br>
signal semiconductor chip such as an Application Specific Integrated Chip (ASIC) or<br>
Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), or may be implemented via a Digital<br>
Signal Processor (DSP) chip.<br>
[0065] If the process is performed by software, the software may reside in software<br>
memory (not shown) in the wireless device 102 (either in the wireless processing<br>
section 200 and/or GPS subsystem 202) or at a server on wireless 104. The software<br>
in software memory may include an ordered listing of executable instructions for<br>
implementing logical functions (i.e., "logic" that may be implement either in digital<br>
form such as digital circuitry or source code or in analog form such as analog circuitry<br>
or an analog source such an analog electrical, sound or video signal), may selectively<br>
be embodied in any computer-readable (or signal-bearing;) medium for use by or in<br>
connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a<br>
computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that may<br>
selectively fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or<br>
device and execute the instructions.  In the context of this document, a "computer-<br>
readable medium" and/or "signal-bearing medium" is any means that may contain,<br>
store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection<br>
with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable<br>
medium may selectively be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic,<br>
optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or<br>
propagation medium. More specific examples "a non-exhaustive list" of the<br>
computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection<br>
"electronic" having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a<br>
RAM (electronic), a read-only memory "ROM" (electronic), an erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), an optical<br>
fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory "CDROM" (optical).<br>
Note that the computer-readable medium may even be paper or another suitable<br>
medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically<br>
captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then<br>
compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and<br>
then stored in a computer memory.<br>
[0066] As previously discussed, the GPS system of the invention may be incorporated<br>
into any number of wireless mobile applications. Similarly, the GPS system can be<br>
used in connection with any number of geo-location services that have the capability<br>
to receive frequency information. Such GPS system can be used in connection with<br>
mobile devices that operate in network aided mode or network based services modes,<br>
or that operate in multi-mode, thereby having the ability to simultaneously switch<br>
between standalone mode, network aided mode, network based services, or other<br>
modes that allow the device to receive frequency information from the a secondary<br>
source, such as a base station.<br>
[0067] While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and<br>
implementations are possible within the scope of this invention.  Accordingly, the<br>
invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A method for improving signal acquisition in a global positioning system (GPS)<br>
device, comprising: obtaining a base station clock frequency from a base station;<br>
determining a first frequency difference between the base station clock frequency<br>
and a call processing (CP) clock frequency of the GPS device; messaging the first<br>
difference to a GPS section of the GPS device, the GPS section having a GPS<br>
clock; calculating a second frequency clock difference between the CP clock and<br>
the GPS clock; and generating a error frequency by adding the first difference to<br>
the second difference.<br>
Dated this 25th day of August 2005.<br>
The invention relates to an aided Global Positioning System (GPS) subsystem within a<br>
wireless device. The wireless device includes a wireless processing section capable of<br>
receiving signals from a wireless network and a GPS subsystem having a radio frequency<br>
(RF) front-end capable of receiving a GPS satellite signal. The wireless processing<br>
section of the wireless device receives an external clock and determines the offset<br>
between the clock in the wireless processing section and that of the external clock. The<br>
GPS subsystem then receives the offset information from the wireless processing section,<br>
information related to the nominal frequency of the wireless processing section clock and<br>
the wireless processing section clock. Using this information and the GPS clock in the<br>
GPS subsystem, the GPS subsystem determines an acquiring signal, which is related to a<br>
frequency offset between the GPS clock and the network clock. The GPS subsystem then<br>
acquires GPS satellite signals in an acauirine unit through the use of the acquiring signal.</td>
