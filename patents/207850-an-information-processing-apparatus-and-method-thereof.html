Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Referring to the drawings, the best mode for carrying out the present invention is explained in detail.<br>
Fig.l shows an embodiment of a picture recording and/or reproducing system according to the present invention. A personal computer 1-1 is fed with signals supplied from an antenna 2, adapted for receiving electrical waves transmitted from a specified television broadcasting station, and reproduces a specified picture and speech, that is picture and speech of a so-called television program, while recording the picture and the speech. The personal computer 1-1 also reproduces the picture and the speech corresponding to analog signals supplied from VCR (video cassette recorder) 3 or digital data supplied from DVCR (digital video cassette recorder) 4, over a network 5, such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) 1394, while recording the picture and the speech.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 sends analog signals corresponding to the recorded speech and picture to the VCR 3, or sends digital data corresponding to the recorded picture and speech to the DVCR 4.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 transmits to the server 7 a message requesting transmission of data for recording reserving of a pre-set program of a pre-set television station, referred to below as recording reservation data, through a network 6, such as Ethernet or Internet, based on the procedure such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).  The server 7 is a so-called Web server, adapted for receiving a<br>
-9~<br><br><br>
message requesting transmission of recording reservation data for recording reservation of a pre-set program of a pre-set television broadcasting station, transmitted from the personal computer 1-1, referred to below as the recording reservation data, to transmit to the personal computer 1-1 data for reserved recording of the pre-set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station, associated with the message.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 receives data for recording reservation of the pre¬set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station, to execute reserved recording of the pre-set program based on the received data.<br>
The personal computer 1-2 appends recording reservation data for recording reserving of the pre-set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station to an E-mail to send the resulting E-mail over the network 6 to the personal computer 1-1. The personal computer 1-1 receives the E-mail transmitted from the personal computer 1-2 to execute the reserved recording of the program by exploiting the recording reservation data appended to the E-mail.<br>
In Fig.2, the personal computer 1 also receives an E-mail, having attached thereto data for recording reserving of a pre-set program of a pre-set television broadcasting station, over a network 6, such as Ethernet or Internet, from the personal computer 7. This recording reservation data is e.g., data of the v-calendar system. The personal computer 1 sets recording reserving, based on the recording reservation data appended to the E-mail, to execute the reserved recording of the pre-set program.<br>
-/o-<br><br>
to transmit the resulting E-mail over the network 6 to the personal computer 1 -1. The personal computer 1-1 receives the E-mail, transmitted from the personal computer 1-2, to execute the reserved recording of the pre-set program.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 generates the recording reservation data by a PIM (personal information manager) program and appends the generated recording reservation data to the E-mail to transmit the resulting data to the personal computer 7.<br>
A personal computer 7-1 is a personal computer used by a user different from the user of the personal computer 1. The personal computer 7-1 generates recording reservation data by the personal information manager program and attaches the generated recording reservation data to an E-mail which is transmitted to the personal computer 1.<br>
A personal computer 7-2 is a personal computer used by a user different from the user of the personal computer 1 and from the user of the personal computer 7-1. The personal computer 7-2 generates recording reservation data by the personal information manager program and attaches the generated recording reservation data to an E-mail which is transmitted to the personal computer 1.<br>
The personal computer 7-2 receives the E-mail, to which is attached the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 7-1, to display the contents of the recording reservation data by a pre-set personal information manager program. Of course, the personal computer 7-2 is able to receive the E-mail, to which<br>
H-<br><br>
is attached the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 7-1, to transmit the resulting E-mail to the personal computer 1.<br>
The personal computer 7-1 also receives the E-mail, to which is attached the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 7-2, to display the contents of the recording reservation data by a pre-set personal information manager program. The personal computer 7-1 is able to receive the E-mail, to which is attached the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 7-2, to transmit the E-mail to the personal computer 1.<br>
Similarly to the personal computer 7-1 or the personal computer 7-2, the personal computer 1 is able to display the contents of the recording reservation data attached to the E-mail, by the specified personal information manager program, to transmit the E-mail to the personal computer 7-1 or 7-2.<br>
If there is no necessity of distinguishing the personal computer 7-1 and the personal computer 7-2 from each other, the personal computer 7-1 or the personal computer 7-2 is simply termed a personal computer 7.<br>
Fig.3 is a block diagram for illustrating the structure of the personal computer 1. A CPU (central processing unit) 21 executes a variety of application programs or a basic operating system (OS). A read-only memory (ROM) 22 generally stores basic stationary data among parameters for arithmetic operations or programs used by the CPU 21. A RAM (random-access memory) 23 stores a program used by the CPU 21 in its operation and parameters incidentally changed as the program proceeds. These<br>
-12s-<br><br><br>
components are interconnected by a host bus 24 constructed by a CPU bus or a memory bus.<br>
The host bus 24 is connected via a bridge 25 to an external bus 26, such as a PCI (peripheral component interconnect/interface) bus.<br>
A keyboard 28 is acted upon by a user inputting various commands to the CPU 21. A mouse 29 is acted on by the user commanding or selecting a point on a screen of a cathode ray tube (CRT) 30 configured for demonstrating the various information by texts or images. An HDD (hard disc drive) 31 and an FDD (floppy disc drive) 32 actuate a hard disc and a floppy disc, respectively, to cause the hard disc or the floppy disc to record and/or reproduce the information or the program executed by the CPU 21. A loudspeaker 33 reproduces the specified speech. The above components from the keyboard 28 to the loudspeaker 33 are connected to an interface 27, which in turn is connected to a CPU 71 over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24.<br>
A picture processing board 34 generates specified picture or speech data, based on signals supplied from an antenna 2, digital picture or speech data supplied from the DVCR 3, or picture or speech digital data supplied from the DVCR 4 or the DVCR 5, through the network 6-1, to output the generated data via the external bus 26 and the interface 27 to the HDD 31.<br>
The picture processing board 34 is fed with picture or speech data, recorded on the HDD 31, through the external bus 26 and the interface 27, to generate analog signals corresponding to the input picture or speech data, to send the generated<br>
-/3 -<br><br><br>
signals to the VCR 3. Alternatively, the picture processing board 34 generates digital data, corresponding to the input picture or speech data, to send the generated data over the network 5 to the DVCR 4.<br>
The picture processing board 34 is connected over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24 to the CPU 71.<br>
A communication board 35 is a device for connection to the network 6. In more detail, it is constituted by an Ethernet board etc and is connected over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24 to the CPU 71.<br>
The structure of the picture processing board 34 is now explained. Fig.4 shows the structure of the picture processing board 34. The 1394 interface 51 is configured in meeting with the prescriptions of the IEEE 1394 interface 51 and is connected to the network 5. The 1394 Interface 51 receives picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, supplied from the DVCR 4 or the DVCR 5, based on the protocol consistent with the provisions of the IEEE 1394 interface 51, to send the received data to a DV (Digital Video) data interface 52.<br>
The 1394 interface 51 also sends picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, routed from the DV data interface 52, to the DVCR 4, based on the protocol in meeting with the prescriptions of the IEEE 1394 interface 51.<br>
The DV data interface 52 outputs picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, sent from the 1394 interface 51, and picture or speech digital data, routed from the digital selector 57, such as so-called non-compressed 4:1:1 digital data, to<br><br><br>
r<br><br>
the DV data companding circuit 53, and also outputs the picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format supplied from the DV data companding circuit 53 to the 1394 interface 51, while outputting the non-compressed picture or speech digital data, supplied from the DV data companding circuit 53 and the digital selector 57, to the digital selector 57.<br>
The DV data companding circuit 53 expands the picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, supplied from the DV data interface 52, to non-compressed picture or speech digital data, to output the expanded digital data to the DV data interface 52. The DV data companding circuit 53 also compresses the non-compressed picture or speech digital data, supplied from the DV data interface 52, into picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, to output the resulting compressed digital data to the DV data interface 52.<br>
The tuner 54 is fed with RF (radio frequency) signals, fed from the antenna 2, to output picture or speech analog signals of a specified channel to the analog selector 52. The analog selector selects one of the picture or speech analog signals, sent from the tuner 54, VCR 3 or the D/V (digital/analog) conversion circuit 61, to output the selected signals to the A/D (analog/digital) conversion circuit 56 or the VCR 3.<br>
The A/D conversion circuit 56 converts the picture and speech analog signals, sent from the analog selector 55, into digital data, such as so-called 4:1:1 picture data, to output the converted signals to the digital selector 57, The digital selector 57 is fed with picture and speech digital data output by the DV data interface 52, A/D<br>
15<br><br>
conversion circuit 56 or the MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) decoder 60 to select one of the picture or speech digital data to output the selected data to the DV data interface 52, MPEG encoder 58 or D/A conversion circuit 61, and to a bridge 59.<br>
The MPEG encoder 58 compresses the picture or speech digital data, sent from the digital selector 57, to digital data of the MPEG system, to output the resulting data to the bridge 59. The MPEG encoder 58 also converts a scene change picture into a still picture which is output to the bridge 59.<br>
The bridge 59 outputs the non-compressed picture or speech digital data, supplied from the digital selector 57, to the CRT 30, through the PCI bus 26 of the personal computer 1, carrying the picture processing board 34, and through the interface 27. The bridge 59 outputs the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system, sent from the MPEG encoder 58, through the PCI bus 26 of the personal computer 1 carrying the picture processing board 34 to the HDD 31 or to the CPU 21. The bridge 59 also receives the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system from the HDD 31 of the personal computer 1 over the PCI bus 26 to output the received digital data to the MPEG decoder 60.<br>
The MPEG decoder 60 expands the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system, supplied from the bridge 59, into non-compressed picture or speech digital data, to output the expanded data to the digital selector 57.<br>
The D/A conversion circuit 61 converts the picture or speech digital data, supplied from the digital selector 57, into analog signals, which are output to the<br>
~le-<br><br>
analog selector 55.<br>
Meanwhile, the processing corresponding to the MPEG encoder 58 or the MPEG decoder 60 may be executed by the CPU 21 in accordance with a specified program.<br>
Fig.5 illustrates the structure of the personal computer 7. The CPU 81 actually executes a variety of application programs or a basic OS. A ROM 82 stores basically fixed data among parameters for arithmetic operations and the program used by the CPU 81. The RAM 83 stores the program used in the execution of the CPU 81 or parameters incidentally changed during the program execution. These components are interconnected over a host bus 84 constituted by the CPU bus or the memory bus.<br>
The host bus 84 is connected through the bridge 85 to an external bus 86, such as a PCI bus.<br>
A keyboard 88 is acted upon by a user inputting various commands to the CPU 81. A mouse 89 is acted upon by the user making commands or selection of points on a screen of a CRT 90. The CRT demonstrates the various information by texts or images. An HDD 91 and an FDD 92 drive the hard disc or the floppy disc to cause the hard disc or the floppy disc to record and/or reproduce the information or the program executed by the CPU 81. These components from the keyboard 88 to the FDD 92 are connected to an interface 87, which in turn is connected to the CPU 71 through an external bus 86, a bridge 85 and a host bus 84.<br>
A communication board 93 is a device for connection to the network 6,<br><br>
constructed by e.g., an Ethernet board, and is connected to the CPU 71 through the external bus 86, bridge 85 and the host bus 84 to the CPU 71.<br>
Fig.6 illustrates an application program executed by the personal computer 1. A recording and/or reproducing program 101 causes the picture processing board 34 to select one of the picture or speech analog signals of a specified channel, as received by the tuner 54, picture or speech analog signals, sent from the VCR 3, and the picture or speech digital data sent over the network 5 from the DVCR 4. The recording and/or reproducing program 101 also converts the selected analog signals or digital data into picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system to record the resulting digital data in the HDD 31 as AV (audio visual) data made up of one or more files of a pre-set format.<br>
The recording and/or reproducing program 101 also causes the picture processing board 34 to expand the AV contents, recorded on the HDD 31 as one or more files of a predetermined format, to generate pre-set non-compressed picture or speech digital data to display the picture on the CRT 30 as well as to reproduce the speech by the loudspeaker 33.<br>
An AV content management retrieval program 102 demonstrates the pre-set information, such as the date and time of recording or the AV contents recorded on the HDD 31. The AV content management retrieval program 102 also commands the recording and/or reproducing program 101 to reproduce the pre-set AV contents to select the AV contents as an object of editing to supply the information of the selected<br><br>
AV content information to an AV content editing program 103 to command reservation recording to an reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
Based on the AV contents recorded on the HDD 31, the AV content editing program 103 edits the pre-set picture and speech of the selected AV contents, that is connects the picture and the speech contained in the pre-set AV contents, to generate AV contents of a pre-set form reproducing the edited picture or speech.<br>
The AV contents are not provided with picture or speech digital data, and are constructed by the information specifying the AV contents as selected, the information exploiting the selected information and the information specifying the speech, and hence can be reproduced by the recording and/or reproducing program 101.<br>
The reservation recording setting program 104 generates the AV contents executing the reservation recording, based on the setting. These AV contents are responsive to the setting ( recording time and recording mode determining the picture quality) to secure the storage area for the HDD 31 at the outset. The reservation recording setting program 104 also generates the AV contents executing the reservation recording based on the recording reservation data furnished from the WWW (World Wide Web) browser 106 or an E-mail program, not shown.<br>

In the following, explanation on the speech is omitted.<br>
Fig.9 shows an illustrative structure of the AV contents. In the content database 122, recorded in the HDD 31, there are recorded attributes of the respective AV contents. In an AV content attribute record 152-1, recorded in the content database 122, there are stored data, such as name, ID (identification data), date and time of formulation, date and time of change, date and time of recording, channel name, recording mode, state, term of validity, shown by date and time, setting of the mistaken deletion, presence or absence of errors, two-dimensional bar code and memo, as attributes of the AV contents 151-1. In an AV content attribute record 152-2, recorded in the content database 122, there are stored data, such as name, ID, date and time of formulation, date and time of change, date and time of recording, channel name, recording mode, state, term of validity, setting of the mistaken deletion, presence or absence of errors and memo, as attributes of the AV contents<br>
25 <br>
151-2.<br>
The recording mode data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-1 indicate that the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3 are one of high quality, standard and video CD compatible, which video CD compatible specifies that the picture data are of the MPEG-1 system. On the other hand, the status data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-1 indicate that the AV content attribute record 151-1 is in an reservation queue, in recording state, in the recording and/or reproducing state, that is in the state of recording data and reproducing recorded picture data, in the non-reproducing state, in the reproducing state or in the replay end state.<br>
The error indicates the states of the AV content attribute record 151-1, such as the personal computer 1 malfunctioning during recording, recording aborted partway, recording state during recording being bad such that input signals from the antenna 2 are not reproduced, or partial dropout of the moving picture file 161-1-1.<br>
As for the setting of the term of validity and the setting for inadvertent deletion, neither one is set, or one of them is set, while it does not occur that both are set simultaneously.<br>
The recording mode data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-2 indicate that the moving picture data files 161-2-1 to 161-2-3 are one of high quality, standard and video CD compatible. On the other hand, the status data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-2 indicate that the AV content attribute record 151-2<br>
-L€-<br><br>
is in the reservation queue, in recording state, in the recording and/or reproducing state, in the non-reproducing state, in the reproducing state or in the replay end state.<br>
The AV content attribute record 151-1 is made up of moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3, recorded on the HDD 31, and of moving picture data files 162-1-1 to 162-1-3, recorded on the HDD 31. In the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3, there are stored picture data of the MPEG system. The picture corresponding to the picture data stored in the leading end of the moving picture data file 161-1-2 is consecutive to a picture corresponding to picture data stored in the trailing end of the moving picture data file 161-1-1. Similarly, the picture corresponding to the picture data stored in the leading end of the moving picture data file 161-1-3 is consecutive to a picture corresponding to picture data stored in the trailing end of the moving picture data file 161-1-2.<br>
In a still picture data file 162-1-1, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-1 and data on the scene change time are stored. In a still picture data file 162-1-2, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-2 and data on the scene change time are stored. In a still picture data file 162-1-3, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-3 and data on the scene change time are stored.<br>
-2-7-<br><br>
The AV contents 151-2 are made up of the moving picture data files 161-2-1 to 161-2-2 and still picture data files 162-2-1 and 162-2-2, and are similar to the AV contents 151-1. Therefore, the AV contents 151-2 are not explained specifically.<br>
If there is no necessity of demarcating the AV contents 151-1 and the AV contents 151-2 from each other, these are simply termed an AV contents 151. If there is no necessity of demarcating the AV contents attribute record 152-1 and the AV contents attribute record 152-2 from each other, these are simply termed an AV contents attribute record 152. If there is no necessity of demarcating the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3 from one another, or if there is no necessity of demarcating the moving picture data files 161-2-1 or 161-2-2 from each other, these are also termed a moving picture data file 161. In addition, if there is no necessity of demarcating the still picture data files 162-1-1 to 162-1-3 or the still picture data files 162-2-1 or 162-2-2 from one another, these are simply termed a still picture data file 162.<br>
The picture the recording and/or reproducing program 101 displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 is hereinafter explained. Fig. 10 shows a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the picture recording operation is possible.<br>
In a picture recording window 181 are set a channel for recording, a recording mode etc. When the picture recording is started, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 sets the operation of the tuner 54 of the picture processing board 34 or<br>
-2-S-<br><br>
the MPEG encoder 58 of the picture processing board 34, based on the setting of the picture recording window 181, to generate pre-set AV contents 151 and the AV contents attribute record 152 for recording on the HDD 31.<br>
When the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, a picture recording button 182 and a recording stop button 183 are both active to enable the operation. That is, if the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 starts and halts picture recording when a recording button 182 is clicked and a stop button 183 is clicked, respectively.<br>
If the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, a playback button 184 and a pause button 185 are non-active, such that the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is not in operation even when the playback button 184 or the pause button 185 is clicked, respectively.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the recording and/or reproducing program 101 has started picture recording. The picture recording window 181 displays the time elapsed as from start of picture recording and the current time in addition to the recording channel and the recording mode.<br>
When the recording is started, the recording button 182 is changed to a recording time change button 191. The recording time is changed whenever the recording time change button 191 is clicked.<br>
A picture displayed when a specified AV contents 151 or AV contents 121 are<br>
-*.-<br><br>
reproduced by the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is explained. Fig.12 illustrates a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is able to perform a reproducing operation.<br>
In a playback window 201 is displayed e.g., a picture recording mode of the AV contents to be reproduced. When the playback window 201 is selected and active, the stop button 183, playback button 184 and the pause button 185 are active to enable the operation. That is, when the playback window 201 is selected and active, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 starts, transiently stops and ultimately stops the reproduction when it is the reproducing button 184, pause button 185 and the stop button 183 that has been clicked, respectively.<br>
On the other hand, if the playback window 201 is selected and active, the picture recording button 182 is non-active, such that the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is not in operation even when the recording button 182 is clicked.<br>
Since the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is responsive to selection of the picture recording window 181 or the playback window 201 to change the recording button 182, stop button 183, reproducing button 184 or the pause button 185 to an active or non-active state, the user is able to know the possible contents of operation reliably and hence is able to operate speedily to prevent inadvertent operation.<br>
The picture recording reservation is hereinafter explained. Figs.13 to 15 illustrate a picture displayed on the CRT 30 on startup of the recording reservation<br>
-3o~<br><br>
setting program 104. On startup, the recording reservation setting program 104 first demonstrates a window setting a channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording, as shown in Fig. 13. The user sets the channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording in each pre-set file of the window. In the illustrated embodiment, hour and minute are set in respective different fields.<br>
If, after setting the channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording, a specified button, a button labelled "next" in the illustrated embodiment, is clicked, the recording reservation setting program 104 reads the channel for recording and data on the date and time of start of recording, as set in a specified field, to change the window to a window setting the end time and the recording mode shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The recording reservation setting program 104 displays the channel as set for recording and data on the recording start date and time, in a window used for setting the end time and the recording mode, while displaying the end time and the recording mode in the respective fields. It is noted that hours and minutes are set in respective different fields.<br>
When the end time and the recording mode are set in this window, the recording reservation setting program 104 displays data usable as index for setting, such as using amount of the HDD 31. If the end time and the recording mode are set and a pre-set button, herein the button labelled "next", is clicked, the recording reservation setting program 104 reads-in the data of the end time and the recording<br>
-3/-<br><br>
mode, as set in pre-set fields, to change the window to a window for confirming the setting shown in Fig. 15.<br>
The recording reservation setting program 104 displays data, such as the channel for recording, time and date of start of recording, time and date of end of recording and the recording mode, in the window used for confirming the setting. If the pre-set button, herein a button labelled "end", is clicked, the recording reservation setting program 104 causes the AV contents 151, executing the reservation recording, to be recorded on the HDD 31, to register the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the recorded AV contents 151 in the content database 122.<br>
The AV contents 151, executing the reservation recording, has, from the outset, a moving picture data file 161, including a recording area associated with the recording time and the recording mode. If, for example, the quantity of data of a picture per second in a standard mode is 5 Mbits, the recording reservation setting program 104, set for recording for four hours in the standard mode, generates one or more moving picture data files 161, having a sum total of 9 Gbytes, in the HDD 31, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
14400 sec*(5M bits/sec)/(8 bits/byte) = 9G bytes since four hours is equal to 14400 seconds.<br>
The operation of the recording reservation setting program 104 generating the AV contents 151, designed for executing the reserved recording based on the pre-set recording reservation data downloaded from the server 7, is now explained. If the<br>
-31-<br><br>
user boots the WWW browser 106, the personal computer 1-1 causes a pre-set picture to be displayed, based on the pre-set file stated in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) furnished from the server 7 over the network 6.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a picture the personal computer 1-1 running the WWW browser 106 demonstrates on the CRT 30, based on a pre-set file supplied from the server 7. The personal computer 1-1 demonstrates the so-called program table. In this program table, there are arrayed pre-set recording reservation data download buttons 251-1 to 251-11 in association with the respective programs.<br>
If, for example, the reservation data download button 251-1 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "news at 7 o'clock" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-2 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "TV map" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-3 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "drama" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-4 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "local weather" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-5 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "After School Club" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button<br>
-33-<br><br>
-3ft<br>
251-6 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Dactylologic Corner" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-7 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Health for Tomorrow" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-6 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Dactylologic Corner" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-7 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Health for Tomorrow" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-8 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Tonight With You" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-9 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Lets Learn Braille" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-10 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Processing-Baseball" of Nippon TV is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-11 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the " Friday TV of Sun 1" of TOTAL BITS OF A PICTURE (TOTAL_BITS) is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
-34-<br><br>
Since the recording reservation data includes data necessary for recording reservation explained with reference to Figs.13 to 15, except the recording mode, the personal computer 1-1 is able to record the AV contents of executing the reserved recording in the HDD 31, even in the absence of setting by the user, if the recording mode is previously set, and if the recording reservation data downloaded on actuating the recording reservation data downloading button s 251-1 to 251-11 is used.<br>
Fig. 17 shows an example of recording reservation data constituted by text data.<br>
The "Content-type: application/x-tv-program-info; charsetjis", indicated on line 1 of the recording reservation data, indicates that this data is the recording reservation data. In line 3 of the recording reservation data is stated, next to "station:", data for specifying a channel for recording. For example, in "station: Nippon TV" of Fig. 17, data for specifying channel for recording is "Nippon TV".<br>
The data for specifying the channel for recording is converted into data specifying a pre-set channel (broadcasting station) by processing in which ambiguous description in a pre-set range is allowed and which exploits the channel conversion file shown in Fig. 18.<br>
For example, in a character sequence of the channel conversion file "4,0,0,4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV", the first numerical figure from left "4" is data specifying the channel, the numerical figure "4" to the right of the third comma from left is channel representing data and the letter sequence to the right of the fifth comma from left, divided by commas, that<br>
-3i^<br><br>
is "Nippon TV", "Nittele", "Nippon TV Broadcasting Network" and "NTV" denote letter sequences for matching to the pre-set letter sequence of the channel conversion file.<br>
For example, if line 3 of the recording reservation data states: "station: Nippon TV", the recording reservation setting program 104 checks whether or not the letter string "Nippon TV" next to "station" is in agreement with the letter string next to the fifth comma from left in the channel conversion file.<br>
If the letter sequence "4, 0, 0, 4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV" is included in the channel conversion file, as shown in the embodiment of Fig. 18, the recording reservation setting program 104 verifies that the letter sequence "Nippon TV" (lying to the right of the fifth comma from left) is matched to the letter sequence of the channel conversion file. If the letter sequence of the recording reservation data is matched to that of the channel conversion file, the recording reservation setting program 104 sets the data specifying the matched channel of the same line of the channel conversion file as a channel.<br>
For example, if the letter sequence "4,0,0,4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV" is matched to the letter sequence of the recording reservation data, the channel 4 is set.<br>
So, if the letter sequence for specifying the channel in the recording reservation data is one of "Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV", the remote controller 4 can set the channel 4 based on the recording<br>
3e~<br><br>
^34 reservation data.<br>
So, even if the letter sequence specifying the channel of the recording reservation data is ambiguous to more or less extent, the remote controller 4 can set the pre-set channel based on the recording reservation data.<br>
There is stated, on lines 4 to 7 of the recording reservation data, data for specifying the date and time of starting the recording, whereas, on line 8 thereof, there is stated data specifying the recording end time.<br>
The recording reservation data can not only be downloaded from the server 7, but also be appended to an E-mail for transmission to the personal computer 1-1. Since the recording reservation data is constituted by letter string data, the user of the personal computer 1-2 is able to prepare the recording reservation data easily using e.g., a ubiquitous application program, such as a word processor or a text editor.<br>
The format explained with reference to Fig. 17 is called TVPI (TV Program Information). The specifications of the TVPI are hereinafter explained. 1. Data Rules<br>
The file extension in saving TVPI as a file is TVPI (TV Program Information).<br>
Although data is text data, Content-Type is application/x-tv-program-info such that only the 2-byte line feed codes of OxOd and 0x0a are allowed.<br>
In the TVPI, data of the broadcasting station is handled, however, as for the alphabet for the name of the broadcasting station, any of Ascii, 2-byte code numerical figures or alphabets will do. The use of the so-called half-size Jtatakana is, however,<br>
-^7"-<br><br>
3<y not allowed.></y>
The name of the broadcasting station is not defined strictly. The broadcasting station is specified by ambiguous retrieval having several sorts of names inclusive of different names.<br>
The letters indicating year, month, date, hour or minute (alphabets for abbreviation of month names in English, numerical figures and colons) are limited to ascii (1-byte code). 2. Data Structure<br>
The TVPI data is made up of "a header portion" and a "memo portion". The "memo portion" can, however, be dispensed with and abbreviated, if so desired.<br>
The header and memo portions are separated from each other by one or more lines.<br>
From these specifications, no void line in the leading portion of the file is allowed, with the header portion being up to the first void line and with the memo portion beginning at the non-void line following the first void line. Header Portion<br>

The operation of generating AV contents 151 executing the reserved recording based on the recording reservation data appended to a pre-set E-mail received from the personal computer 7 can be carried out by a method other than that shown in Fig. 16.<br>
Fig. 19 illustrates a picture displayed on the CRT 90 by the personal computer 7 operating the personal information manager program. When the personal information manager program is in operation, the personal computer 7 causes a so-called scheduled input picture to be displayed. On this scheduled input picture, there<br>
-vr-<br><br>
are arranged a case name input field 301, in which to enter a scheduled case name, a scheduled site input field 302, in which to enter the scheduled site, a scheduled start date input field 303, in which to enter the scheduled start date, a scheduled start time input field 304, in which to enter the scheduled start time, a scheduled end date input field 305, in which to enter the scheduled end date, and a scheduled end time input field 306, in which to enter the scheduled end time.<br>
When generating recording reservation data, a user inputs a title of a program to be appointed for recording, in the case name input field 301, while inputting the channel in the site input field 302. The user also inputs the airing start date of a program in the scheduled start date input field 303, while inputting the scheduled start date in the date input field 303, while inputting the scheduled start time in the scheduled start time input field 304 and inputting the program airing end date in the scheduled end date input field 305 and in the scheduled end time input field 306, respectively.<br>
For example, in an example shown in Fig.9, "closeup ancient times" is entered as a program title in the case name input field 301, "1" indicating a channel 1, is input to the site input field 302 as a channel over which the program is aired, "1999/06/01" for June 1,1999, indicating the date of start of airing of the program, is input to the scheduled start date input field 303, "21:00" indicating the time of start of the airing of the program, is input to the scheduled start time input field 304, "1999/06/01" for June 1, 1999, indicating the date of end of airing of the program, is input to the<br>
-£~<br><br>
N4 scheduled end date input field 305, and "21:45" is input as the program airing end time to the scheduled end time input field 306.<br>
After inputting the pre-set data, the personal information manager program of the personal computer 7 generates recording reservation data of the v-calendar system, in association with the data input to the case name input field 301, site input field 302, scheduled start date input field 303, scheduled start time input field 304, scheduled end date input field 305 and to the scheduled end time input field 306, subject to designation of pre-set commands by the user.<br>
The user of the personal computer 7 attaches recording reservation data of the v-calendar system to the E-mail to transmit the E-mail to the personal computer 1. Fig.20 shows an example of a picture displayed on the CRT 90 by an E-mail program, similar to an E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1, and which displays an E-mail with attached recording reservation data of the v-calendar system. On a screen of the E-mail program, demonstrating an E-mail with the recording reservation data of the v-calendar system attached thereto, an icon 281 corresponding to the recording reservation data of the v-calendar system is displayed.<br>
When the personal computer 1 receives the E-mail, having the v-calendar system recording reservation data appended thereto, the E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1 displays a picture similar to that shown in Fig.20 on the CRT 30.<br>
The E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1 receives the-mail, carrying the v-calendar system recording reservation data transmitted from the personal<br>
~V7-<br><br>
computer 7, to record the v-calendar system recording reservation data independently, subject to actuation of the icon 281 for the v-calendar system recording reservation data, as displayed on the screen of the E-mail program 106. Alternatively, the E-mail program 106 sends an E-mail to the reservation recording setting program 104. The v-calendar system recording reservation data contains data necessary for recording reservation as explained with reference to Figs. 13 to 15, except the recording mode. Therefore, if the recording mode is previously set, the reservation recording setting program 104 of the personal computer 1 is able to record the AV contents 151 executing the reservation recording in the HDD 31, even in the absence of the setting from the user of the personal computer 1, on the condition that the recording reservation data appended to the E-mail is utilized.<br>
Fig.21 shows an example of the v-calendar system recording reservation data, which is made up of text data.<br>
In the recording reservation data, "BEGIN: VCALENDAR" on line 1 specifies that this data is the data of the v-calendar system.<br>
On line 5 of the v-calendar system recording reservation data, there is stated data specifying date and time of starting the recording next to "DTSTART". For example, in "DTSTART: 19990601T210000Z" in Fig.16, "19990601" sandwiched between "DTSTART:" and "T" denotes that the recording start date is June 1,1999, whilst "210000" sandwiched between "T" and "Z" indicates that the recording start time is 21:00:00.<br>
-VI-<br><br>
&gt;5L<br>
Similarly, on line 6 of the recording reservation data of the v-calendar system, there is stated data specifying date and time of recording termination. For example, in "DTEND: 19990601T214500Z" in Fig.21, "19990601" between the "DTEND:" and "T" denotes that the recording end date is June 1,1999 and "214500" between "T" and "Z" denotes that the recording end time is 21 hour 45 minute 00 second.<br>
Similarly, on line 7 of the recording reservation data of the v-calendar system, there is stated, next to "LOCATION", data specifying the recording channel. For example, "LOCATION: 1" of Fig.21 indicates recording of one channel.<br>
On line 9 of the recording reservation data of the v-calendar system, there is stated, next to "DESCRIPTION" the name of the program to be recorded. In Fig.21, "DESCRIPTION: close up ancient times" denotes that the name of the program to be recorded is the "closeup ancient times".<br>
In this manner, by the user of the personal computer 7 transmitting an E-mail, having attached thereto the E-mail, having attached thereto the embodiment reservation data, the user of the personal computer 1 is able to record the pre-set program readily.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.22, the processing for recording reservation in case the reservation recording setting program 104 is executed using the WWW browser 106 is explained. At step Sll, the WWW browser 106 verifies whether or not the recording reservation data has been transmitted from the server 7. If it is verified that the recording reservation data has not been transmitted from the server<br>
(/(?-.<br><br>
7, the WWW browser 106 reverts to step S12 to repeat the processing until the recording reservation data has been transmitted from the server 7. If it is verified at step S12 that the recording reservation data has been transmitted from the server 7, the WWW browser 106 advances to step S13 where it receives the recording reservation data to furnish the received recording reservation data to the reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
At step sl4, the reservation recording setting program 104 executes the processing for channel setting based on the supplied recording reservation data. The processing for channel setting will be explained subsequently in detail with reference to Fig.23.<br>
At step S15, the reservation recording setting program 104 displays a message certifying to the reservation setting in e.g., a window shown in Fig.15.<br>
At step S16, the reservation recording setting program 104 records AV contents in reservation queue, inclusive of a moving picture data file 161 which has secured a pre-set area of the HDD 31, based on the supplied recording reservation data. At step S17, the reservation recording setting program 104 causes the contents database 152 to generate the AV contents attribute record 152, corresponding to the AV contents in reservation queue, based on the supplied recording reservation data, to terminate the processing.<br>
In this manner, the reservation recording setting program 104 and the WWW browser 106 is able to execute the reservation of recording of a pre-set program<br>
So-<br><br>
speedily.<br>
The processing for channel setting, corresponding to step S14 of Fig.22, is now explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.23. At step S21, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads-in the recording reservation data furnished from the WWW browser 106. At step S22, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads out the character string next following "station" of the recording reservation data.<br>
At step S23, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads out a character string of a pre-set channel name from a channel conversion file. At step S24, the reservation recording setting program 104 verifies whether or not the character string next following "station" is coincident with the character string of a pre-set channel name. If it is verified that character string next following "station" is coincident with the character string of the pre-set channel name, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S25 to set a channel corresponding to the character string of the pre-set channel name.<br>
At step S26, the reservation recording setting program 104 sets channel demonstration corresponding to the channel as set at step S25 (that is sets data for channel demonstration and data for channel name demonstration) to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S24 that character string next following "station" is not coincident with the character string of the pre-set channel name, the reservation<br>
-yTI-<br><br>
-5* recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S27 to verify whether or not the totality of the character strings of the channel names have been read out. If it is verified that the totality of the character strings of the channel names have been read out, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S28 to display a message reading that no channel has been found on a CRT 30 to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S27 that the totality of the character strings of the channel names have not been read out, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S29 to read out a character string of an other channel name. The reservation recording setting program 104 then reverts to step S24 to repeat the processing for verifying the possible character string coincidence.<br>
As described above, the reservation recording setting program 104 is able to set a pre-set channel despite certain ambiguity in the character string next following the "station" of the recording reservation data.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.24, the processing for furnishing recording reservation data by a server 7 in case the Web server program is loaded on a RAM 83 and a CPU 81 executes a Web server program, is now explained. At step S51, the Web server program receives a message from the personal computer 1-1 based on e.g., the HTTP. At step S52, the Web server program verifies whether or not a message received from the personal computer 1-1 is a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data.   If it is verified that the message received from the<br>
-£*_-<br><br>
personal computer 1-1 is a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data, the Web server program proceeds to step S53 to transmit recording reservation data corresponding to the message to the personal computer 1-1 to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S52 that the message received from the personal computer 1-1 is not a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data, the step S53 is skipped to terminate the processing.<br>
In this manner, the server 7 furnishes pre-set recording reservation data to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
The processing of transmitting recording reservation data by the E-mail program of the personal computer 7-1 is explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.25. At step Sill, the E-mail program of the personal computer 7-1 attaches recording reservation data, previously generated and recorded, to an E-mail. At step SI 12, the E-mail program of the personal computer 7-1 transmits the E-mail, having the recording reservation data appended thereto, to the personal computer 1 over the network 6 to complete the processing.<br>
As described above, the E-mail program of the personal computer 7-1 is able to transmit the recording reservation data to the personal computer 1. It is possible for the E-mail program to attach the recording reservation data appended to the E-mail received from a personal computer 7-2 at step Sill to its E-mail.<br>
The processing of reception of the recording reservation data by the E-mail<br>
S3-<br><br>
program 106 of the personal computer 1 is explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig. 18. At step S121, the E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1 receives an E-mail, having attached thereto the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 7-1 or 7-2, over the network 6. At step SI22, the E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1 records the recording reservation data, attached to the E-mail, in the RAM 23 or in the HDD 31, to terminate the processing.<br>
It is possible for the E-mail program 106 to send the recording reservation data appended to the E-mail at step SI22 directly to the reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
In this manner, the E-mail program 106 of the personal computer 1 is able to receive the recording reservation data.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.27, the processing of recording reservation by the reservation recording setting program 104 of the personal computer 1 is hereinafter explained. At step S131, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads out the recording reservation data recorded on the RAM 23 or on the HDD 31. If, at step S32, the E-mail program 106 directly sends the recording reservation data, attached to the E-mail, to the reservation recording setting program 104, the step S51 can be omitted.<br>
At step S132, the reservation recording setting program 104 records the AV contents 151 in an reservation queue, including the moving picture data file 161 which has secured a pre-set area of the HDD 31, based on the read-out recording<br>
--5-7-<br><br>
reservation data. At step S13, the reservation recording setting program 104 causes a content database 152 to generate an AV content attribute record 152, corresponding to the AV contents 151 in reservation queue, based on the recording reservation data, to complete the processing.<br>
The reservation recording setting program 104 of the personal computer 1 executes the recording reservation processing, as described above.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.28, the processing for the reservation recording in case the reservation monitoring program 105 resident in the RAM 23 is executed by the CPU 21 is now explained.<br>
At step S71, the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the current time from the RTC, not shown. At step S72, the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the AV contents 151 in a pre-set reservation queue is read out.<br>
At step S73, the reservation monitoring program 105 compares the current time to the recording start time contained in the AV contents attribute record 152 to check whether or not the reservation recording is to be started. If it is verified that the reservation recording should be started, the program moves to step S74 to start the recording. The reservation monitoring program 105 overwrites data of the picture generated in the picture processing board 34 on the previously recorded data file 161. At step S75, the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the current time from the RTC, not shown. At step 76, the reservation monitoring program 105 compares the current time to the recording end time contained in the AV contents<br>
-63~<br><br>
^S4 attribute record 152 to check whether or not the recording reservation is to be terminated. If it is verified that the recording reservation is not at an end, the recording is continued so that the program moves to step S75 to repeat the processing of verifying the end time.<br>
If it is verified at step 76 that the recording reservation is to be terminated, the program moves to step S77 where the reservation monitoring program 105 changes data of the AV contents attribute record 152 to a pre-set value. The recording then comes to a close to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S73 that the recording reservation is not to be started, the program moves to step S78 where the reservation monitoring program 105 verifies whether or not the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the entire AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has been read out in its entirety. If it is verified that the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the entire AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has not been read out in its entirety, the program moves to step S79, where the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to another AV contents 151 in the reservation queue. The program then reverts to step S73 to repeat the processing for decision as to starting the recording reservation.<br>
If it is verified at step S78 that the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has been read out in its entirety, there lack AV contents 151 that are to be recorded by reserve, so that<br>
-S
 <br>
processing comes to a close.<br>
As described above, the reservation monitoring program 105 executes the recording reservation based on the AV contents 151 in the reservation queue and the current time.<br>
The above-described sequence of operations can be executed by the hardware, however, it can also be executed by software. If the sequence of operations is executed by the software, the program constituting the software is installed in a computer built into a hard disc recorder, as a dedicated hardware, or in e.g., a ubiquitous computer in which a variety of programs are installed to execute variable functions.<br>
The processing of transmitting recording reservation datably an E-mail program of the personal computer 1-2 is explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.30. At step S91, the E-mail program of the personal computer 1-2 appends the recording reservation data to the E-mail. The E-mail program transmits the E-mail, having the recording reservation data, appended thereto, to the personal computer 1-1 to terminate the processing.<br>
As described above, the E-mail program is able to transmit the recording reservation data to the personal computer 1-1. The personal computer, on receipt of the E-mail, having the recording reservation data, appended thereto, is able to make the reservation for recording by the processing similar to that explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.22.<br>
~si~<br><br>
r<br>
Referring to Fig.29, a medium used in installing a program for executing the above-described sequence of operations on a computer to set a state executable by the computer is explained, taking a case wherein the computer is a ubiquitous personal computer as an example.<br>
The program can be furnished in a pre-installed state on a hard disc 302, as a recording medium enclosed in a personal computer 301, corresponding to a hard disc enclosed in the hard disc drive 31 of Fig.3, or in a pre-installed state on a semiconductor memory 303, as shown in Fig.29A.<br>
Alternatively, the program can be transiently or permanently stored in a recording medium, such as a floppy disc 311, a CD-ROM (compact disc-read only memory) 312, MO (magneto-optical) disc 313, DVD (digital versatile disc) 314, a magnetic disc 315 or a semiconductor memory 316, and furnished as packaged software, as shown in Fig.29B<br>
Moreover, the program can be transmitted over a radio path from a downloading site 321 through an artificial satellite 322 for digital satellite broadcasting to the personal computer 301, or transmitted through a network 331, a local area network or Internet, so as to be stored in the enclosed hard disc 302 in the personal computer 301, as shown in Fig.29.<br>
The meaning of the medium in the specification is to be construed broadly to comprise all these mediums.<br>
The personal computer 301 has enclosed therein a central processing unit<br>
-s§-<br><br>
(CPU) 342, as shown for example in Fig.31. To the CPU 342 is connected an input/output interface 345 over a bus 341. If a command is input via an input unit 347 comprising a keyboard, a mouse etc, through the input/output interface 345, the CPU 342 executes the program stored in a read-only memory (ROM) 343 corresponding to the semiconductor memory 303 of Fig.21A. Alternatively, the CPU 342 loads a program on a RAM (random-access memory) 344 to execute the program. This program is pre-stored on the hard disc 302, or is transmitted from an artificial satellite 322 or a network 331, received by a communication unit 348 and subsequently installed on a hard disc 302, or is read out from the floppy disc 311, CD-ROM 312, DVD 314 or the magnetic disc 315 loaded on a drive 349 so as to be installed on the hard disc 302. The CPU 342 outputs the processing results via e.g., the input interface 345 to a display 346 made up e.g., of a liquid crystal display (LCD).<br>
Also, the step of stating the program furnished by the medium may include not only the processing executed chronologically in accordance with a stated sequence but also the processing executed in parallel or separately without being processed chronologically.<br>
In the present specification, the system is to be construed as meaning an entire apparatus made up of plural devices.<br>
-si-<br><br>
