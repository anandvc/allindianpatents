COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br>
LIQUID CLEANSING<br><br><br><br>
BIPHASIC COMPOSITION INDUCED                BY POLYDEXTROSF<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporater order the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
GRANTED <br>
30-1-2006<br><br>
105/MUMNP/2005<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to aqueous liquid cleansing compositions which are biphasic in nature.  More specifically, such compositions are characterized by having (assuming they have been standing a sufficiently long period of time after shaking) both an upper aqueous layer and a separate lower aqueous layer.  In the subject invention, formation of the biphasic liquids is induced by use of sufficient amount of polydextrose wherein the polydextrose is within an approximate molecular weight window.  The amount of polydextrose required to induce biphasic formation can be reduced if some salt is used.<br>
Biphasic liquids defined by the general fact that the liquid is divided into two phases are not new.  Most of these liquids comprise both one layer which is an aqueous layer, and a second layer comprising a water immiscible oily material.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,718,609 to Weimer, for example, discloses a liquid detergent composition having an aqueous layer and a layer of liquid water immiscible oily material.  When shaken, the liquid forms a temporary oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,810,478 to Olson Jr. et al. discloses a two phase shampoo composition made by preparing substantially polar and lipophilic portions of a shampoo composition.<br><br><br>
Biphasic compositions comprising an upper and lower aqueous phase are also disclosed in the art.  U.S. Serial No. 09/643,142 to Williams et al., entitled "A Separating Multi-Phase Personal Wash Composition in a Transparent or Translucent Package" discloses biphasic compositions comprising:<br>
(a)	5 % to 35 % surfactant;<br>
(b)	1 % to 12 % thickener;<br>
(c)	4 % to 20 % polyalkylene glycol; and<br>
(d)	sufficient non-chelating mineral salt to induce phase separation.<br>
While the total amount of salt/electrolyte is not specifically discussed in the above specification, it is apparent from the examples that the amount sufficient to induce formation of biphasic layer is at least in the order of 4 %, 5 %, 6 % and greater. By contrast, in the subject invention, salt is not required at all for biphasic formation and, if used, is generally in an amount less than 3 %, preferably about 2 % by wt. or less and more preferably about 1 % by wt.or less. As discussed in the specification below, using small amounts of salt (i.e., about 0.5 % to 3 %, preferably 0.5 % to 1 %) does allow a lesser amount of polydextrose to be used to induce biphasic formation.<br>
In addition, unlike the compositions in the Williams et al. specification, the compositions of the subject invention are induced by polydextrose, and are stable and they do not require either thickener or polyalkylene glycol as is required by the compositions of Williams.<br><br><br>
EP-A-O,116,422 to Reckett and Coleman also discloses multi-layered compositions in which two liquids are dispersible, and which separate on standing.  Again, at least 6 % salt/electrolyte (e.g., sodium hexamataphosphate) are required in these compositions (see page 4, lines 17-19). The biphasic liquids of the invention are induced by polydextrose, not salt, and no salt is required, although small amounts (e.g., up to about 3 %, preferably about 2 % or less, more preferably about 1.5 % or less, more preferably about 1 % or less) may be used.<br>
In addition, the compositions of the subject invention are preferably used in translucent or transparent compositions (i.e., for the sensorial benefit) and such is not taught or suggested in EP 0,116,422.<br>
Unexpectedly, the applicants have now found that biphasic liquids (e.g., liquids which separate into top and bottom aqueous liquids) may be induced merely by addition of sufficient quantity of specifically defined polydextrose.<br>
More specifically, the present invention comprises liquid personal cleansing compositions comprising:<br>
(1)	5 % to 75 %, preferably 6 % to 40 % by wt. of a surfactant selected from the group consisting.of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
(2)	at least about 15 %, more preferably at least 20 % by wt. of polydextrose or mixture of polydextrose molecules, wherein the degree of polymerization<br><br><br>
(e.g., number of linking glucose units) is 4 to 22 (this corresponds to MW of about 600 to about 3600); and (3)  balance water and minors.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the invention comprises compositions wherein at least 1 % salt is used and levels of polydextrose may be 10 %.  In a further embodiment, the invention comprises composition wherein at least 2 % salt is used and polydextrose level may be as low as 5 %.<br>
The present invention relates to biphasic liquid cleansing compositions wherein the formation of the biphasic liquid is induced by the addition of sufficient amount of polydextrose, wherein the degree of polymerization (defining number of linking glucose groups) is 4 to 22. This corresponds approximately to MW of about 600 to 3600.<br>
More specifically, the invention comprises:<br>
(1)	5 % to 75 % by wt. of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof;<br>
(2)	at least 15 % polydextrose, wherein the degree of polymerization (i.e., number of linking glucose units) is 4 to 22 or have an MW of 600 to 3600; preferably MW is 700 to 1800, more preferably 900 to 1500  and more preferably 900  to 1200;   and<br>
(3)	balance water and minors.<br><br><br>
The general concept behind the invention is that, when sufficient amount of specified polydextrose is added, phase separation occurs.  For example, this is shown in the Examples wherein, when 20 % polydextrose MD180 (MW 1000) is added, separation occurs.  Different surfactant systems can be used, and the specific type of surfactant is not a limiting factor.<br>
The inventive compositions may be used in combination with a transparent package in order to view the liquid.  Thus, in one embodiment, the invention also comprises a system<br>
r?<br>
comprising said transparent or translucent package in combination with the liquid.<br>
Typically, once the biphasic composition is formed (e.g., the composition "settles" after having been shaken), the viscosity of the lower layer is lower than that of the upper layer.<br>
Also, the density of lower layer is typically greater than that of upper layer.<br>
Typically, in such biphasic liquids, there is no recrystallization visible after composition has been, standing for 6 months at room temperature.<br>
The final product will have shower-gel like viscosity of 100 to 5000 mPas, preferably 200 to 4000 at shear rate 10s"1 at 25°C measured using H'aake RV2 0 Rotovisco Rheometer.<br><br><br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, a small amount of salt is used and the amount of polydextrose needed to induce biphasic liquid is reduced.  More specifically, in this embodiment, the composition comprises at least 1 % salt and at least 10 % polydextrose.<br>
In a third embodiment, the composition comprises at least 2 % salt and at least 5 % polydextrose.<br>
The various components of the composition are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
The surfactant generally will comprise 5 % to 75 % by wt. of the total composition.<br>
The surfactant is a surfactant which may be selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, there will be at least one anionic surfactant.<br>

The biphasic inducing polydextrose compounds of the invention may also be defined by molecular weight in that they should have MW range of from 600 to about 3 600, more preferably 700 to 3000, more preferably 700 to 1800, more preferably 900 to 1500.<br>
Whether defined by glucose units or MW, it should be understood that the critical point is that the structure is such as to induce formation of a multiphasic/biphasic formulation defined by those characteristics which in turn define the biphasic liquid (e.g., viscosity of and stability in the biphasic state).<br>
The amount of polydextrose used to induce biphasic state may vary depending on whether salt/electrolyte is used.<br>
Thus, for example,- if no salt is used (use of no or little salt also distinguishes this invention from other biphasic liquids of the art where relatively large amounts of salt,<br><br><br>
e.g., greater than 3 % by wt., are in fact required to induce the biphasic liquid) , then there is needed at least 15 % by wt. of polydextrose to induce biphasic separation. If some salt is added (e.g., at least 0.5 %, preferably at least 1.0 %), the amount of polydextrose needed goes down to 10 % by wt.  If at least 2 % salt is used, the amount of polydextrose may be 5 %.<br>
There is also generally a balance between amount of surfactant used, and amount of polydextrose Generally lower surfactant requires more polydextrose and, conversely, more surfactant requires less polydextrose.  Thus, for example, 5 % to 10 % by wt. surfactant may require about 40 % or more polydextrose, and 35 % surfactant may need only about 10-15 % polydextrose, even in the absence of salt.<br>
Generally, the upper limit of polydextrose used is about 75 %. This is not an upper limit with regard to inducing biphasic liquid.<br>
If electrolyte/salt is used, it typically will be used in amount of 0.5 % to no higher than 4 %, preferably no higher than about 3 % by wt. of total composition.<br>
Preferably, the electrolyte is not a chelating electrolyte (these are generally poor in biodegradability).<br>
Typically, the electrolyte should be a salt of a sulphate, bisulfate, carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate, chloride, etc. Examples include, sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate, ammonium sulphate, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride.<br><br><br>
Magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride are particularly preferred.<br>
Finally, the balance of composition is water and minors.<br>
The following optional ingredients may be used in the multiphasic/biphasic compositions of the invention.<br>
The composition may contain polyalkylene glycol.  The polyalkylene glycol should be an alcohol, glycol or polyether of minimal molecular weight which is not irritating to the skin.<br>
Examples of such include alcohols, particularly polyalkylene oxides having MW 200-6000, preferably 200 to 3000.  The polyalkylene glycol can be comprised of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or their mixtures either as polymers or copolymers.  Specific examples include polyethylene glycols such as PEG 400. As noted, use of such alcohols is not required.<br>
The composition may further comprise thickeners. Generally, the thickener/viscosity modifier serves to thicken the upper and/or lower layer.<br>
Thickeners which may be used include hydrophobically modified polyethers.  Examples of this class of thickeners which may be used include but are not limited to sugar esters such as PEG (160) sorbitan triisostearate (Rheodol TWS -399C ex. Kao Chemicals) or PEG-120 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate ex. Croda.  Other examples include Glucam DOE<br><br><br>
120 (PEG 120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate); Rewoderm® (PEG modified glyceryl cocoate, palmate or tallowate) from Rewo Chemicals; Antil® 141 (from Goldschmidt); and Carbopol® polymers from Noveon.<br>
Another class of suitable polymers are hydrophobically modified cellulose ethers including but not limited to hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and cellulose ethers with long pendant chains such as nonoxynyl hydroxyethylcellulose (Amerchol Polymer HM 1500).<br>
Another class of suitable polymers are the hydrophobically modified acrylate copolymers such as Antil 2 08   (ex Goldschmidt) (acrylate/steareth-50 acrylate copolymer).<br>
Another class of suitable polymers are the hydrophobically modified polyurethanes such as Acrysol series (e.g., Acrysol RM-2020) from Rhom and Haas.<br>
Another class of suitable thickeners are xanthan gums, guar gums and chemically modified guar gums.<br>
In addition to the ingredients noted above, the compositions of the invention may contain hydrotropes including but not limited to short chain monohydric or dihydric alcohols, xylene sulphonate and hexylene glycol.  The purpose of these is to avoid the formation of liquid crystal phases resulting from the separation of the surfactant material into the upper phase, hence increasing its apparent concentration.<br><br><br>
The compositions may comprise benefit agents.  Benefit agent may be any material that has potential to provide an effect on, for example, the skin.<br>
The benefit agent may be water insoluble material that can protect, moisturize or condition the skin upon deposition from compositions of invention.  These may include silicon oils and gums, fats and oils, waxes, hydrocarbons (e.g., petrolatum), higher fatty acids and esters, vitamins, sunscreens.  They may include any of the agents, for example, mentioned at column 8, line 31 to column 9, line 13 of U.S. Patent No. 5,759,969, hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application.<br>
The benefit agent may also be a water-soluble material such as glycerin, polyols (e.g., saccharides), enzyme and a-Or P~ hydroxy acid, either alone or entrapped in an oily benefit agent.<br>
The benefit agent may be found in either the upper or the lower layer, depending on its solubility and partition coefficient; for example, oil may partition into the upper layer while more water soluble agents (e.g., a-hydroxyacids) may go into the lower.<br>
The compositions may comprise perfumes, sequestering agents such as EDTA EHDP in amounts 0.01 % to 1 %, preferably 0.01 % to 0.05 %; coloring agents, opacifiers and pearlizers such as zinc stearate, magnesium stearate, Ti02, mica, EGMS (ethylene glycol monostrearate) or styrene/acrylate copolymers.<br><br><br>
The compositions may further comprise antimicrobials such as 2-hydroxy 4,2'4' trichlorodiphenylether (DP300), 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide, essential oils and preservatives such as dimethyl hydantoin (Glydant XL 1000), parabens, sorbic acid etc.<br>
The compositions may also comprise coconut acyl mono or diethanol amides as suds boosters, and strongly ionizing salts such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate may also be used to advantage.<br>
Antioxidants such as, for example, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) may be used advantageously in amounts of about 0.01 % or higher if appropriate.<br>
Cationic conditioners which may be used including Quatrisoft LM-200 Polyquaternium-24, Merquat Plus 3330- Polyquaternium<br>
39; and Jaguar type conditioners.<br>
Composition may also include clays such as Bentonite  claims<br>
as well as particulates such as abrasives, glitter, and shimmer.<br>
The compositions of the invention, when unmixed, typically have a viscosity of the lower layer which is lower than the viscosity of the upper layer, and a density of the lower layer which is greater than the density of the upper layer.<br><br><br>
The compositions of the invention, in a separated state, are also stable in that no recrystallization (e.g., in the lower layer) occurs even when left sitting for more than 6 months at temperature of 0°C.<br>
Compositions of the invention have an experiential element in that they are intended to be agitated by the consumer to mix and form a single visible phase before separating again after a time, which can be anywhere from about a few seconds to not more than about 24 hours.<br>
When mixed, the compositions typically have a viscosity in the range of 100 to 5000, preferably 200-400 mPas at a shear<br>
rate of 10s  at 25°C at a shear rate of 10s  at 25°C, as<br>
measured by using Haake RV2 0 Rotivisco Rheometer.<br>
Finally, the packages in which the compositions are contained are preferably translucent or'transparent. By this is meant that the materials (e.g., plastics) have a light transmittance of greater than 50 %, preferably greater than 75 %, more preferably greater than 85 % as measured at wavelength of 460 nm as determined by standard spectroscopy method. In practical terms the package should preferably be sufficiently transparent to permit the separation of the two or more layers to be visible to the naked eye.<br>

Methodology<br>
Measurement of Viscosity<br>
Description<br>
A Haake Rheometer was used to measure the viscosities of liquid and semi-solid personal wash products in the small scale with the viscosity measured at various shear rates.<br>
Equipment<br>
The instrument was an RV 20 Rotovisco RC 2 0 rheometer which includes a stand and sample temperature control unit, cups and bobs for loading the sample, a waterbath which is<br><br><br>
maintained at 25°C and a computer and plotter to manipulate and record the data.<br>
Operational Procedure<br>
The Haake rheometer, computer, monitor and printer were turned on.<br>
Water bath: The water bath was filled with water to a required level,   the appropriate temperature was set and water bath was turned on.<br>
Measurement Systems: The sample was loaded into rheometer and equilibrated to 25°C.<br>
a)	the appropriate cup and bob for the product are<br>
selected as noted below.<br>
i)  NV for viscosity measurements of low viscous products, e.g. diluted solutions, fruit juices, etc;<br>
ii)  SV1 for viscosity measurements of high viscosity liquids working in the low to medium range which consists of a SV cup with a rotor(bob).  This is the cup and bob that is typically used to measure shower gel products;<br>
b)	the rotor(bob) was secured on to the top segment of the measuring system;<br>
c)	the RV 20 rheometer was adjusted using the zero button;<br>
d)	the sample was poured into the cup until almost three quarters filled (approx. 20 g), and then the<br><br><br>
cup was carefully slid through the temperature controller and screwed to the main segment of the rheometer so that it was immersed in the product and sample was slightly above the rim of the bob; e)   waited 5 to 10 minutes after loading the sample to ensure equilibration of sample to set temperature (set parameters on computer while waiting for temperature equilibration).<br>
Computer<br>
a)	a floppy disc was inserted and previous standard<br>
file was loaded if one is already saved on disc.<br>
If not, the following details were loaded into the<br>
computer:<br>
i)   measurement: select SV1, NV1, SV2P depending<br>
on the spindle used; ii)  select four segments for four shear rates, 1,<br>
10, 100, 400 at 25°C and in 10 steps;<br>
b)	on the computer screen follow the steps below to<br>
load the above details:<br>
measurement - identification (record details of the sample);<br>
measurement - parameter - select SV1; measurement - go immediately (after sample is equilibrated);<br>
c)	this starts the measurement which takes about 10 minutes;<br>
d)	once the measurement was completed, results were saved on floppy disk; results were either printed or set as graphical representation.<br><br><br>
Results<br>
The results were recorded as viscosity in mPas (cps) at the shear rates: l/sec, 10/sec and lOO/sec. The temperature and spindle (bob) size were recorded with each sample measurement.<br>

Materials<br><br><br><br><br>
Formulation Preparation<br>
A simple surfactant solution was prepared at about 5 wt.% to about 35.0 wt.% without any saccharides.  Then saccharides were added to desired level. After adding saccharides, sample was heated for 1 hour at 60°C to dissolve any solid materials, then allowed to cool to room temperature.  Once sample reached equilibrium at room temperature, it was mixed by shaking and observation are made.<br>
Viscosity &amp; Product Appearance<br>
Formulations were screened for viscosity using standard PW protocols as set forth in methodology section above.  The formulations were observed for any discoloration and re-crystallisation of saccharides at room temperature.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples 1-6 and Comparative 1-4<br>
Polydextose (i.e., Polydextrose M180) was examined for its ability to promote the formation of biphasic shower gel formulations, compared to sucrose, sorbitol and glucose. Results are set forth in Table 1 and 2 below.<br><br><br>

As seen from Table 1, when 15-16% surfactant is used (SLES/CAPB), only the polydextrose was able to promote phase separation in the absence of salt (Example 1 and 2)<br>
In Table 2, shown below, the applicants test for the effect of salt (e.g., MgS04) as well as for the effect of surfactant level versus amount of polydextrose needed.<br><br><br>

This table also shows various points.  First, the table shows that the polydextrose level can be lowered without increasing surfactant level, if small amounts of salt (e.g., MgS04) are used (see Example 4). Also, Table 2 shows that higher levels of polydextrose permit much lower levels of<br><br>
surfactant (Example 5) and, conversely, high levels of surfactant permit use of lower levels of polydextrose (Example 6).  One other interesting point is that polydextrose Ml00 does not appear to form biphasic. However, as seen in Table 3 below, when salt is added, biphasic is formed, even at lower surfactant levels.<br>
Examples 7-12 and Comparative 5<br>
Different surfactant systems are also able to produce biphasic formulations when combined with the proper levels of polydextrose and salt. As with SLES/CAPB, the blend of ammonium laurylether sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate and cocoylmonoethanolamide will also promote phase separation (See Table 3 below).  Examples 7-9 and Comparative 5 compare polydextrose M180 with and without salt in the surfactant mix.  No phase separation is achieved with 25 % polydextrose M180 alone (Comparative 5), but phase separation can be<br>
achieved with incorporation of low levels of MgSO4 or NaCl<br>
(Formulations 7-9).<br>
Also, the addition of low levels of salt promote phase separation with other polydextrose.  Similar biphasic formulations can be produced with polydextrose M250 (Example 10), polydextrose M100 (Example 11) and polydextose M040, although the lower layer is turbid in these three formulations (Table 3 below).  By using low levels of salt, a number of different polydextrose materials with different molecular weights and varying numbers of glucose units can be used to promote the formation of biphasic surfactant formulations.<br><br><br>
