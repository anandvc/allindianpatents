Working-up the reaction mixtures and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures.<br>
Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known, manner, and vice-versa.<br>
Compounds of formula I in optically pure form can be obtained from the corresponding racemates according to well-known procedures, e.g. HPLC with chiral matrix. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used.<br>
Protecting groups<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, may need to be protected in the starting materials by protecting groups. The protecting groups employed may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the<br><br>
end-products. I ne specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.<br>
The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley, New York 1981, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden derorganischen Chemie" (Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyi, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Ge.org Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" (Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro and in animals, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
The agents of the invention are inhibitors of aspartic proteases and can be used for the treatment of disorders involving processing by such enzymes. Particularly they inhibit beta-secretase and as such inhibit the generation of beta-amyloid and the subsequent aggregation into oligomers and fibrils.<br>
Test 1 Inhibition of human BACE<br>
Recombinant BACE (extracellular domain, expressed in baculovirus and purified using standard methods) at 6 nM concentration is incubated with test compound at various concentrations for 1 hour at room temperature in 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.1 % CHAPS. Synthetic peptide substrate Mca-Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys(DNP) is added to a final concentration of 3 pM and increase in fluorescence is recorded at excitation of 325 nm.and emission at 400 nm in a microplate spectro-fluorimeter for 20 minutes in 1-minute intervals. IC50 values are calculated from percentage of inhibition of BACE-activity as a function of test compound concentration.<br><br>
Test 2 Inhibition of human BACE-2<br>
Recombinant BACE-2 (extracellular domain, expressed in baculovirus and purified using standard methods) at 2.5 nM concentrations incubated with test compound at various concentrations for 1 hour at room temperature in 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.1 % CHAPS. Synthetic peptide substrate Mca-Ser-GIu-Vai-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys(DNP) is added to a final concentration of 3 pM and increase in fluorescence is recorded at excitation of 325 nm and emission at 400 nm in a microplate spectro-fluorimeter for 20 minutes in 1-minute intervals. IC5o values are calculated from percentage of inhibition of BACE-2-activity as a function of test compound concentration.<br>
Test 3 Inhibition of human Cathepsin D<br>
Recombinant cathepsin D (expressed as procathepsin D in baculovirus, purified using standard methods and activated by incubation in sodium formate buffer pH 3.7) is incubated with test compound at various concentrations for 1 hour at room temperature in 100 mM sodium formate buffer, pH 3.1. Synthetic peptide substrate Mca-Gly-Lys-Pro-lle-Leu-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(DNP)-D-Arg-NH2 is added to a final concentration of 2 pM and increase in fluorescence is recorded at excitation of 325 nm and emission at 400 nm in a microplate spectro-fluorimeter for 20 minutes in 1-minute intervals. IC50 values are calculated from percentage of inhibition of cathepsin D-actiyity as a function of test compound concentration.<br>
Test 4 Inhibition of cellular release of amyloid peptide 1-40<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells are transfected with the gene for amyloid precursor protein. Cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well in a 96- well microtiter plate and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10 % FCS. Test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and cells are cultivated for 24 hours in presence of test compound. Supernatants are collected, and concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using sandwich ELISA. Potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of test compound concentration.<br>
In at least one of the above-indicated tests, the agents of the invention show activity at concentrations below 20 JIM.<br><br>
The agents of the invention are therefore useful e.g. for the treatment and/or prevention of neurological and vascular disorders related to beta-amyloid generation and/or aggregation such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Down's Syndrome, memory and cognitive impairment, dementia, amyloid neuropathies, brain inflammation, nerve and brain trauma, vascular amyloidosis, or cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis.<br>
Some of the agents of the invention also inhibit BACE2 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 2) or Cathepsin D, close homologues of the pepsin-type aspartyl proteases. Due to the correlation of BACE2 and CathD expression with a more tumorigenic and metastatic potential of tumor cells, such inhibitors are useful for the suppression of the metastasis process associated with tumor cells.<br>
For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 to about 100, preferably from about 1 to about 50 mg/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 10 to about 2000, preferably from about 10 to about 200 mg of an agent of the invention conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained release form.<br>
The agent of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides an agent of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical, e.g. for the treatment of neurological and vascular disorders related to beta-amyloid generation and/or aggregation.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner. Unit dosage forms contain, for<br><br>
example, from about 1 to about 1000, preferably from about 1 to about 500 mg of an agent of the invention.<br>
The agents of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents effective, in the treatment of conditions mentioned above. Such other pharmaceutical agents can be selected especially from donepezil hydrochloride, e.g., in the form as marketed under the trademark Aricept™, rivastigmine, e.g., in the form as marketed e.g. under the trademark Exelon™ and galantamine hydrobromide e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Reminyl™.<br>
The structure of the active agents mentioned above may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The pharmaceutical combination may be in form of a unit dosage form, whereby each unit dosage will comprise a predetermined amount of the two components, in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. Alternatively, the combination may be in form of a package containing the two components separately, e.g. a pack or dispenser-device adapted for the concomitant or separate administration of the two active agents, wherein these agents are separately arranged. When the combination partners employed are applied in the form as marketed as single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the package insert of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise.<br>
Moreover the present invention provides the use of an agent of the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any neurological and vascular disorders related to beta-amyloid generation and/or aggregation.<br>
In still a further aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of any neurological and vascular disorders related to beta-amyloid generation and/or aggregation, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to such subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention are also commercially useful as research chemicals.<br>
