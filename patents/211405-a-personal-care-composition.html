THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
A PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following  specification  particularly describes the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
515/MUMNP/2004<br>
11/09/2004<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
16-9-2004<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to cosmetic compositions containing organic sunscreens  which are stabilized against degradation 5  by incorporation of 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives in the compositions.<br>
Certain organic substances, known as sunscreens, whose molecules absorb the harmful ultraviolet rays, are widely used in cosmetic compositions to protect human skin against the damaging effects of sunlight.  Sunscreens are described in many publications, including Nicoll et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,188,831 and Dobrowski et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,961,961. The effectiveness of sunscreens is measured in 15  terms of a property known as the Sun Protection Factor (SPF), as is well know to one skilled in the art.<br>
The ideal sunscreen should be sufficiently chemically and physically stable so as to provide an acceptable shelf life upon storage.  It is particularly desirable that the preparation should retain its protective effect over a prolonged period after application.  Thus, the active agent when present on the skin must be resistant to chemical or photodegradation, to absorption through the skin, and to removal by perspiration, skin oil, or water.<br>
Sunscreen agents in the order of decreasing effectiveness may be categorized as either highly chromophoric monomeric organic compounds, inorganic compounds and minimally 30  chromophoric polymeric organic solids.<br><br>
WO 03/080009<br><br>
PCT/EP03/02656<br><br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,558 (Woodin, Jr. et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 4, 919,934 (Deckner et al.) disclose photoprotection compositions wherein the active sunscreen agents are of the chromophoric monomeric organic compound variety.  The examples feature the commercially common sunscreens such as octyl methoxycinnamate (Parsol MCX), ben2ophenone-3(Oxybenzone) and octyl dimethyl PABA.<br>
Chromophoric monomeric, organic compounds are subject to 10  certain problems. Organic sunscreens, when incorporated in personal care compositions or when deposited on skin, lose their sunscreen properties and may change character with time, due to many factors.<br>
15  Among many reasons for degradation, one factor responsible for loss of sun screen factor (SPF) or change in character is that organic sunscreens are oxidatively, or photooxidatlvely, unstable.  Instability is an undesirable characteristic in organic sunscreens.  There is a need,<br>
20  therefore, for an agent that will stabilize organic<br>
sunscreens against degradation.  In particular, there is a need for an agent that will prevent the oxidation or photooxidation of organic sunscreens.<br><br>
25<br>
30<br><br>
The applicants have now discovered that inclusion of 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives in combination with organic sunscreens in personal care compositions provides oxidative or photooxidative stability to the organic sunscreens. Accordingly, the present invention provides a cosmetic composition comprising:<br><br><br><br>
a.	about 0.01 wt.% to about 20 wt.% of an organic<br>
sunscreen,<br>
b.	about  0.0001 wt.% to about 50 wt.% of a 4-<br>
6	substituted resorcinol derivative of the general<br>
formula I<br>
(I)<br>
10<br>
wherein each R1 and R2, independently, represents a hydrogen atom, -CO-R, -COO-R, CONHR; where R represents saturated or unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic C1 - C18 hydrocarbon 5  groups; and<br>
R3 represents (1) an alkyl group, having from 1 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, with or without substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms of a<br>
20     linear alkyl group with a methyl or ethyl group; e.g., R3<br>
constitutes linear or branched chain alkyls, or (2) a group of the general formula (II)<br>
(II)<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein X is hydrogen; OR , wherein R represents hydrogen,<br>
2	2<br>
(C1-C6)alkyl or aryl-(C1-C6)alkyl; OCOR wherein R represents<br>
(C1-C6)alkyl, aryl-(C1-C6)alkyl or phenyl; halogen; (C1-<br>
C6)alkyl; aryl-(C1-C6)alkyl, or aryl-(C1-C6)alkyl; or NHR1<br>
wherein R is defined as above;<br>
wherein n is 0 to 3 such that the structure of general formula II is a 5, 6, 7 or 8 membered ring;<br>
wherein the dashed line indicates an optional double bond;<br>
and<br>
c.  a cosmetically acceptable vehicle,<br>
The inventive compositions are aesthetically pleasing and have improved oxidative or photooxidative stability, which provides longer lasting effect after application to the skin as well as degradation upon storage.<br>
As used herein, the term "cosmetic composition" is intended to describe compositions for topical application to human skin, including leave on and wash-off products.<br>
The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, axillae, hands, legs, and scalp.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The term "inhibit" as it relates to oxidation of sunscreens is intended to describe a decrease in oxidation of sunscreens by at least a certain amount, and at most completely.<br>
Except in the examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about". All amounts are by weight of the composition,    unless otherwise specified.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt the word "comprising"	is intended<br>
to mean including but not necessarily consisting	of or<br>
composed of.  In other words the listed steps or	options need<br>
15  not be exhaustive.<br><br>
The invention is concerned with a cosmetic composition employing 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives to inhibit the degradation of organic sunscreens present therein.<br>
20  Preferably, in the cosmetic compositions of the present<br>
invention, 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives are used to stabilize organic sunscreens against oxidation or photooxidation.  Depending upon the nature of the cosmetic composition, other skin benefit materials and/or cosmetic<br>
25  adjuncts can optionally be present, and the 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives may also serve to provide a skin benefit in addition to having a stabilizing function for the sunscreens.<br>

The amount of the organic sunscreens in the personal care composition is generally in the range of about 0.01% to about 20%, preferably in the range of about 0.1% to about 10%.<br>
Preferred organic sunscreens are Parsol MCX and Parsol 1789, due to their effectiveness and commercial availability.<br><br>
Suitable 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives are known 10  compounds and can be readily obtained, for example, by a<br>
method wherein a saturated carboxylic acid and resorcinol are condensed in the presence of zinc chloride and the resultant condensate is reduced with zinc amalgam/hydrochloric acid {Lille. J. Bitter, LA. Peiner. V, Tr. Nauch-Issled. Inst. 15  slantsev 1969, No. 18, 127), or by a method wherein<br>
resorcinol and a corresponding alkyl alcohol are reacted in the presence of an alumina catalyst at a high temperature of from 200 to 400°C (British Patent No. 1,581,428).<br>
20 The inventive compositions generally contain about 0.01% to about 20% of organic sunscreens and about 0.000001% to about 50% of 4-substituted resorcinols. The particular advantage of the inventive compositions is that organic sunscreens can be stabilized by 4-substituted resorcinols against oxidation or photo-oxidation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The stability of the inventive compositions is achieved by the use of an antioxidant agent which comprises, as an effective component, a resorcinol derivative of the following formula (I):<br><br><br><br>

These linear alkyl groups may be substituted with a methyl or ethyl group at one or more hydrogen atoms thereof.  Specific examples of the substituted alkyl group include an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group, an isoamyl group, or a 2-methylhexyl group.  Preferred alkyl groups are those where R is an ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl group.  The most preferable alkyl<br><br><br><br><br>
'/p(f3/026:<br><br><br><br>
resorcinols are those where R is an ethyl, a butyl or a hexyl group.<br>
  In the above formula (I) where R3 has the general formula II,   the compounds are referred to herein as 4-cyclo-substituted resorcinols of general formula III<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
(III)<br><br>
X is hydrogen; OR , wherein R represents hydrogen, (C1 -<br>
2	2<br>

20  An amount of 4-substituted resorcinol derivative effective to inhibit the oxidation of organic sunscreens may be determined by experimentation. The organic sunscreens and 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives are present in the composition in a weight ratio of about 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably 1:100 to<br>
25  100:1, more preferably 1:1 to 1:100.<br>
The amount of the resorcinol derivative is preferably in the range of about 0.00001% to about 10%, more preferably about 0.001% to 7%, most preferably from 0.01% to about 5% of the 30  total amount of a cosmetic composition.<br><br>
Preferred cosmetic compositions are those suitable for the application to human skin, which optionally but preferably include a skin benefit agent.<br>
Suitable skin benefit agents include anti-aging, wrinkle-reducing, skin whitening, anti-acne, and sebum reduction agents.  Examples of these include alpha-hydroxy acids and esters, beta-hydroxy acids and ester, polyhydroxy acids and esters, kojic acid and esters, ferulic acid and ferulate derivatives, vanillic acid and esters, dioic acids (such as sebacid and azoleic acids) and esters, retinol, retinal, retinyl esters, hydroquinone, t-butyl hydroquinone, mulberry extract, licorice extract, and resorcinol derivatives other than the 4-substituted resorcinol derivatives discussed hereinabove (thereby serving a dual function of providing oxidative stabilization of organic sunscreens and of providing a skin benefit, such as lightening for example).<br>
The skin benefit agent together with the organic sunscreen compound and resorcinol derivative of the invention is usually used along with a cosmetic base.  Suitable cosmetically acceptable carriers are well known to one skilled in the art.  The cosmetic bases may be any bases which are ordinarily used for skin benefit agents, and are thus not critical.  Specific preparations of the cosmetics to which the skin benefit agents of the invention is applicable include creams, ointments, emulsions, lotions, oils, packs and nonwoven wipes. Cream bases are, for example, beeswax, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, glycerine, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monostearate, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether and the like. Lotion bases include, for example, oleyl<br><br><br>
alcohol, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerine, lauryl ether, sorbitan monolaurate and the like.<br>
The cosmetically acceptable vehicle may act as a dilutant, dispersant or carrier for the skin benefit ingredients in the composition, so as to facilitate their distribution when the composition is applied to the skin.<br>
The vehicle may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably, the compositions are aqueous or an emulsion, especially water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, preferentially oil in water emulsion. Water when present will be in amounts which may range from 5% to 99%, preferably from 20% to 70%, optimally between 40% and 70% by weight.<br>
15<br>
Besides water, relatively volatile solvents may also serve as carriers within compositions of the present invention. Most<br>
preferred are monohydric C1-C3 alkanols. These include ethyl<br>
alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol.  The amount of 20  monohydric alkanol may range from 1% to 70%, preferably from 10% to 50%, optimally between 15% to 40% by weight.<br>
Emollient materials may also serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers.  These may be in the form of silicone oils and synthetic esters. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from 0.1% to 50%, preferably between 1% and 20% by weight.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non-30  volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at<br><br><br>

The compositions of Examples 1-7 in the Table above, as well as Example 8 which is the base composition without addition of any resorcinol derivative, were prepared in the following fashion.  Phase A is heated at 75°C.  Phase B is heated to 75°C in a container separate from that of Phase A. Thereafter the phases are combined with mixing with heat being turned off.  Phase C was premixed and warmed then added immediately after phase A and B mixed. Phase D is pre-dissolved and added into the main pot at 60°C.  The 10  mixture is cooled until 40°C and then packed.<br>
Example 9<br>
The photo-stability of organic sunscreens in various 15  cosmetic compositions was measured in the presence and<br>
absence of resorcinol derivatives.  Examples 5 to 8 in the Table above were tested for this purpose.  The resorcinol derivatives in these examples were tested at equivalent molar concentrations in the formulations (18.09mM). The photo-stability of a UVA organic sunscreen, Parsol 1789, in these compositions was assessed by monitoring the loss of Monochromatic Protection Factor (MPF) over time, as outlined below. A comparative composition (Example 8) was made by removing the resorcinol derivative from the compositions in Examples 5 to 7.<br>
Procedure for measuring MPF of cosmetic formulations<br>
An SPF-290 Analyzer with an integrating sphere from 30  Optometries USA was used to acquire the MPF data.  The<br>
software generates a Monochromatic Protection Factor   (MPF)<br><br><br><br>
for each 5nm portion of the scan from 290nm to 400nm.  The MPF is calculated from the reciprocal of the transmission (MPF = 1/Tλ.) at each of these wavelengths(λ  or gamma).  MPF is an indication of the UV protective properties of a skin composition, since the SPF, or sun protection factor, is a weighted average of MPF values at different wavelengths across the UV spectrum. A drop in MPF over time, therefore, indicates loss of sunscreen activity.<br>
The SPF-290 instrument light source is a 125 W xenon arc lamp, operated at 75W, whose beam passes through a wire attenuator and a Schott UG05 filter. The filter attenuates the source radiation above 500nm and alters the spectral distribution to approximate the relative solar irradiance<br>
spectrum in the UV-B and UV-A regions.  The intensity of the<br>
2<br>
beam incident on the sample is approximately 16mW/cm ,<br>
corresponding to approximately 8 times the solar UV intensity at midday in summer in the Northeast US.  The minimum time of test site exposure to the UV beam required for each complete scan is approximately 30 seconds.<br>
After passing through the sample, the radiation is collected in the integrating sphere and separated into discrete wavelength bands with an in-line Fastie-Ebert grating monochromator optimized for UV efficiency. The bands strike the detector and generate a signal proportional to intensity of the radiation. The MPF value at 360nm (UVA) was used for sunscreen photo-stability evaluation in the Examples 5-8.<br><br><br><br>
A UV-transparent quartz plate (10.16cm x 10.48cm x 0.32cm, 4" x 4 1/8" xl/8") was first calibrated by placing it on the automated programmable X-Y stage and scanned to correct for background.  The product film was then applied evenly to the calibrated quartz plate with a spatula.  An 8- path wet film applicator (Paul Gardner Company, Inc.) was used with a 7.62cm (3") path width.  The applicator was manually drawn across the plate using the 1.5 mils gap (1 mil = 0.001 inches or approximately 25 micrometers) and the film allowed to dry for 15 minutes. The quartz plate with the product film was then placed on the X-Y stage and scanned for the baseline measurement (t = 0).  The X-Y stage was set to scan six pre-set sites of the product film.  The same six pre-set sites were scanned every 15 minutes up to 105 minutes, while the product formulations were stored in glass amber jars of 120ml volume at 25°C, to monitor loss of sunscreen performance over time.<br>
Between each measurement, the product film was removed from 20  the UV light source and placed in a drawer at ambient temperatures. The MPF values presented in the table represent the average of readings from the six different sites at each time point.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

significance, i.e., a significant difference between no metal oxides (Example 8) and with metal oxides (Examples 5, 6, 7) .<br>
The results in Table 3 above demonstrate that addition of resorcinol and derivatives to the compositions of this invention provided additional stability.<br>
The data in the Table above was found to be statistically significant, with p-values of less than 0.0001.  The p-values were determined as follows.<br>
Objective - Compare light blockage of the base composition of Example 8 against compositions of Examples 5-7 containing resorcinol derivatives.  The products with resorcinol additives are expected to show a slower decrease in light blockage.  The inverse of light transmission is used as a virtual measure of light blockage.<br><br><br><br>

20<br>
25<br>

Method - The products are applied to glass slides and six spots are measured on each slide.  There are three slides for each of the four products.  This provides a total of 18 spots for each product. As is standard with studies in sunscreens, 15 minutes elapse for drying until the first measure.  Measurements are then taken every 15 minutes until 120 minutes for a total of eight time points.  A mixed effects analysis of variance will take into account the spots within slides and the correlation between time points.<br>
The analysis of variance looks for effects of time, product and time with product interactions.  A significant time with product interaction will show if there is any difference in the rate of change in light blockage among the products.  A contrast comparison will determine if the rate of change for the Example 8 base is significantly different from the three products with resorcinol. Regression models for each product will fit a function to the data for each product. The functions will assess the relationship between time with inverse light transmission.  The functions will assess the linear effect of time.<br>
Results - There are overall significant product, time, product with time interactions effects with p-values less than 0.0001. The contrast shows a significant difference of p= 0.0001 between the composition of Example 8 and the resorcinol derivative containing compositions of Examples 5-7.<br>
