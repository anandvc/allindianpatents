DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HEXAHYDROFUROFURANOL DERIVATIVE, INTERMEDIATE THEREOF AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a production method of a hexahydrofurofuranol derivative represented by the formula (XIV) , particularly the formula (XV), to be mentioned below, which is an intermediate for a pharmaceutical product, compounds represented by the formulas (A), (B) and (C) to be mentioned below, which are useful as synthetic intermediates therefor and production methods thereof.<br>
Background Art<br><br>
, is a compound useful as an intermediate for an anti-AIDS drug (International Publication No. 01/25240 and International Publication No. 99/67254). As a method for synthesizing a compound represented by the formula (XIV) or (XV), the methods described in International Publication No. 01/25240, EP-A-539192, Tetrahedron Letters, 27, p. 3715 (1986) and Tetrahedron Letters, 4, p. 505 (1995) are known. However, they use ozone oxidation and tributyltin hydride etc. having high toxicity, and are not industrially preferable methods. Of the above-mentioned references. International Publication No. 01/25240, EP-A-539192 and Tetrahedron Letters, 4, p. 505 (1995) comprise optical resolution of the obtained racemate with an enzyme and the like to give an optically active compound, whose relative configuration is represented by the formula (XV), and are inefficient. Recently, a method for directly synthesizing an optically active compound, whose relative configuration is represented by the formula (XV), has been reported in Tetrahedron Letters, 42, p. 4653 (2001). This<br><br>
method, too, uses an organic selenium compound having high toxicity, and is not entirely an industrial method.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a compound represented by the formula (XIV) (hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (XIV)), which is useful as an intermediate for an anti-AIDS drug, efficiently and economically on an industrial scale by resolving the problems of conventional production methods, such as ozone oxidation and use of highly toxic reagents, an intermediate used for the method and a production method thereof, particularly, a method for producing compound (XIV) having an absolute configuration represented by the formula (XV) and an enantiomer thereof, without using a technique such as optical resolution and the like, an intermediate for the method and a production method thereof.<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems and, as a result, found a novel production method of compound (XIV), which comprises leading a compound represented by the formula (XIII):<br><br>
wherein PG is a hydroxy-protecting group, and R2 is a lower alkoxyl group or a lower alkylthio group, used as a starting material, to a compound represented by the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein PG is as defined above, introducing a protecting group, which is followed by reduction and cyclization to give compound (XIV), and novel compounds represented by the formulas (A) and (B) to be mentioned below, which are intermediates for the method. Moreover, the present inventors have found a novel production method of compound (XIV), which comprises leading a compound represented by the formula (XIII) used as a starting material to a compound represented by the formula (XIX):<br><br><br>
wherein PG and R2 are as defined above, and R3 is a hydroxy-protecting group or a hydrogen atom, hydrolyzing the compound to give a compound represented by the formula (XX):<br><br>
wherein PG and R3 are as defined above, which is then processed to give a compound represented by the formula (I) or the formula (III):<br><br>
wherein R4 and R5 are the same or different and each independently is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxyl group or a phenyl group, which is an intermediate for the aforementioned method, as well as a novel compound represented by the formula (C) to be mentioned below, which is an intermediate for the method.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, compound (XIV) can be produced efficiently and economically on an industrial scale without using highly toxic reagents or ozone oxidation which is difficult to practice on an industrial scale. Moreover, the present inventors have found that a compound represented by the formula (XIII) can be led to a compound whose absolute configuration is represented by the formula (VII):<br><br>
wherein PG is as defined above, or an enantiomer thereof, highly stereoselectively at a superior optical purity, using<br><br>
an optically active form of the formula (XIII) , particularly an optically active form having a high optical purity, as a starting material according to the above-mentioned method, without using a technique such as optical resolution and the like, since an optically active form of the compound represented by the formula (III) can be produced economically on an industrial scale using a BINAP catalyst or a biological catalyst (USP5399722, Heterocycles, 26, 2841 (1987)), and that a compound whose absolute configuration is represented by the formula (VII) or an enantiomer thereof can be led highly stereoselectively at a superior optical purity to a compound whose absolute configuration is represented by the formula (XV) or an enantiomer thereof, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>
Particularly, they have found that, according to the method of the present invention that proceeds via carboxylic acid represented by the aforementioned formula (XX), a compound whose absolute configuration is a compound represented by the formula (XVIII):<br><br>
wherein PG and R3 are as defined above, or an enantiomer thereof can be obtained highly stereoselectively at a superior optical purity by applying purification when going through said carboxylic acid, thereby increasing the diastereomer purity, and that a compound having an absolute configuration represented by the formula (XVIII) or an enantiomer thereof can be led highly stereoselectively at a superior optical purity to a compound whose absolute configuration is represented by the formula (XV) or an enantiomer thereof, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>
Since the present invention does not use ozone oxidation or a highly toxic reagent, it is a useful production method of an optically active form, as well as a superior production method of a racemate as compared to conventional methods.<br>
The present inventors have further conducted intensive studies to solve the above-mentioned problems, and as a result, found a novel production method of a compound having a<br><br>
relative configuration represented by the formula (XV) by stereoselectively reducing a compound represented by the formula (XXI):<br><br>
wherein PG2 is a hydroxy-protecting group (hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (XXI)) used as a starting material, to give a compound having a relative configuration represented by the formula (XXII):<br><br>
wherein PG2 is as defined above, introducing a protecting group, reducing and cyclizing the compound to give a compound having a relative configuration represented by the formula (XXVI):<br><br>
f and inverting a hydroxyl group to give a compound having a relative configuration represented by the formula (XV), and novel compounds having relative configurations represented by the formulas (G) and (H) to be mentioned below, which is an intermediate therefor.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, a compound having a relative configuration represented by the formula (XV), particularly, a compound having an absolute configuration represented by the formula (XV) and an enantiomer thereof can be produced efficiently and economically on an industrial scale without using a highly toxic reagent or ozone oxidation difficult to practice on an industrial scale, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>

The isolate can be purified by a conventional method but may be used in the next reaction without purification.<br>
