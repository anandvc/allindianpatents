PROVISIONAL   SPECIFICATION<br>
Title <br>
Hydrogenation of imines<br>
Applicant <br>
UNITED PHOSPHORUS LTD., <br>
A company registered under Indian Company's Act 1956 , having its registered office at   3 - 11, Gidc, Vapi - 396 195, State of Gujarat, India and having its office at Uniphos House,  11th road , C. D. Marg, Khar (West), Mumbai - 400 052 , Maharashtra, India, Indian.<br>
The following specification describes the invention:<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a hydrogenation of imines. The present invention further relates to hydrogenation of imines to asymmetric amines. The present invention also relates to hydrogenation of imines to asymmetric amines using immobilized iridium-xyliphos catalyst. This invention particularly relates to preparation of the novel immobilized iridium-xyliphos catalyst for hydrogenation of imines to amines. The invention further relates to a process for manufacture of chloroacetanilide herbicide, more particularly 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N- [(1 S)-2-methoxy-1 -methylethyl] acetamide, (Formula (I)), rich in S isomer, known as (S)-Metolachlor, using novel heterogeneous / immobilized catalyst prepared in one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Back ground and prior art:<br>
Processes for the catalytic hydrogenation of imines with homogeneous iridium catalysts have been known for a relatively long time. Among the various homogeneous catalysts, iridium-xyliphos catalyst has been found most successful commercially in preparation of 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N- [(1 S)-2-methoxy-1 -methylethyl] acetamide [Hans-Ulrich Blaser, Advanced Synthesis and Catalysis, 2002, 344,17-31. Patents describing hydrogenation of imines by homogeneous catalysts are [WO 97/05094], [US 5,011,995], [US 5886225] and [US 6,822,118]. Of these the last one is described below, to make the further work on heterogenisation of homogenous catalysts easy to follow.<br>
US 6822118 describes in general a process for the hydrogenation of imines with hydrogen under elevated pressure in the presence of homogeneous iridium catalysts with appropriate ligand and with or without an inert solvent, wherein the reaction mixture contains an ammonium or metal chloride, bromide or iodide and additionally an acid.. This patent also describes use of this process in hydrogenating (at 50 °C under 80 bar hydrogen pressure), methyl-ethyl-aniline(MEA)imine of the Formula (II) to (S)-N-(2'-methyl-6'-ethyl-phen-1-yl) -N-(l-methoxymethyl)ethylamine of the Formula (III) with about 78 % enatiomeric excess(ee),using {Ir(l,5-cyclooctadiene)-({(R)-l-{(S)-2-<br>
diphenylphosphino)ferrocenyl]}ethyl-di(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphine)Cl] Known of Formula (IV) as Ir Xyliphos catalyst, with acetic acid and toluene; [ Formula (IV) taken<br>
2<br><br>
from Romano Dorta et al.. Chemistry - A European Journal. 2004.10. 267-278. - Fie. 9 on page 269] and conversion of the hydrogenated product of Formula (III) to 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(lS)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl]acetamide of Formula (I),<br>
The catalysts in these homogeneous processes cannot be recovered or can be recovered only with expensive separation methods, which is always associated with undesirable losses. Homogenous catalysts have been immobilized by bonding them on to support materials. Silica supported catalysts gave selectivity (79% ee) close to that of the homogeneous system. However the TON was only 120,000 for the supported catalyst, compared to 1000,000 for the homogenous system. [Thomas. J. Colacot, Chemical Reviews, 200,103(8). 3115] Following patents describe such supported immobilized catalysts and catalytic hydrogenations of imines using such supported catalysts.<br>
WO9702232 describes a process for the hydrogenation of imines with hydrogen at increased pressure in the presence of iridium-diphosphine [XIrYZ] catalysts immobilized on a support material (organic polymers, inorganic metal oxides), a halide and an acid. X is two olefin ligands or one diene ligand. Y is a ditertiary diene phosphine. Of the various diolefins cyclooctadiene is a preferred amongst some others.<br>
The diphosphine Y contains at least one chiral atom, and the diphosphine is particularly preferably an optically pure stereo-isomer (enantiomer or diastereomer), or a diastereomer pair, since optical inductions are achieved in assymetric hydrogenations with catalysts, which contain these ligands. Ferrocenyldiphosphines are preferred ligands for fixing them to an inorganic support material like silica. The diphosphine Y is preferably bonded via silyl group to an inorganic support material T which is chosen from the group consistmg of silicates, semimetal or metal oxides, glasses or mixtures thereof. The solid support material T is preferably a powder having average particle diameters of 10 nm to 2000 urn, preferably 10 nm to 1000 urn, particularly preferably 10 nm to 500 um. The support can be either compact or porous particles. Porous particles preferably have high internal surface areas (determined by BET method), for example 1 to 1200 m , preferably 30 to 600 m2.<br>
3<br><br>
Many support materials organic and inorganic have been suggested. Examples of the oxides of and silicates are SiO2 TiO2, ZrO2, MgO, NiO, W03, A1203, La203, silica gels clays and zeolites. Preferred support materials are silica gels, aluminium oxide, titanium oxide or glass and mixtures thereof.<br>
The said patent discloses the process for preparation of 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(lS)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl]-acetamide from the imines using these immobilized catalysts.<br>
However, there is no detail information on bonding of metal ligand complex to inorganic supports other than silica.<br>
US 6,005,148 describes a supported catalyst comprising a support an anchoring agent such as a heteropoly acid or anion and a metal complex which is useful in a wide variety on organic reactions, especially hydrogenation of substituted a,b  unsaturated acids and esters and a- or |b- keto esters or lactones. Various methods of preparing the supported catalyst of the present invention are also disclosed. Methods for preparing Rh(DIPAMP)/PTA/Al203 catalyst where gamma alumina is support material, anchoring agent phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is heteropoly acid and Rh(COD)(DIPAMP)BF 4 is metal complex catalyst. In brief, to the support material in methanol, PTA in methanol was added, and to this mixture was added metal complex catalyst in methanol, all under inert gas, and providing time for taking in solvent and completion of reaction at each step, all done at room temperature.<br>
One of the main thrusts in homogeneous catalysis today is to immobilize the catalysts on a support. The major forces behind this developing technology are to minimize the metal leaching into products, recycle the expensive ligands, and make the process more environmentally friendly.<br>
Thus there is a need for reusable catalysts which can easily be separated off, the activity of which and in particular the selectivity of which are largely retained during repeated use, especially in respect of large-scale industrial hydrogenation processes and there is a need for use of such catalyst in preparation of amine which in turn is an important intermediate for the preparation of 2-chloro-A'-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(l,S)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl acetamide, S-Metolachlor (I)<br>
4<br><br><br>
(I)	(S-Metolachlor) <br>
2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-Ar-[(15)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl] acetamide<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to develop a new immobilization<br>
method for the iridium-xyliphos catalyst used for hydrogenation of imines.<br>
Another object is to develop a process for asymmetric hydrogenation of imines to amines<br>
using the catalyst developed.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a process for manufacture of<br>
chloroacetanilide herbicide, more particularly 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-<br>
[(lS)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl] acetamide Formula (I) using the catalyst that is<br>
developed.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an immobilized iridium-xyliphos catalyst [Ir( 1,5-cyclooctadiene)-( {(R)-1 - {(S)-2-diphenylphosphino)ferrocenyl]} ethyl-di(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphine)Cl] supported on alumina and anchoring agent hetero poly acid, useful for stereospecific hydrogenation of imines.<br>
The imines are preferably ketimines, tertiary imines like those of Formula (II).<br>
The present invention provides a method of hydrogenation of imines by using the catalysts<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a process for the large scale production of<br>
commercially feasible 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(l S)-2-methoxy-1 -<br>
methylethyl] acetamide of Formula (I) known as herbicide (S)-Metolachlor.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The immobilized iridium-xyliphos catalyst of the present invention is prepared as follows: [IrCODCl]2 solution in methanol is taken in a round bottom flask and the ligand Xyliphos is added to it and the mixture is stirred at about 30 °C until the solution becomes clear. Alumina and phosphotungstic acid hydrate are then added to the clear solution, and the mixture is stirred for about 3 hours under nitrogen atmosphere to form the catalyst. The mass is filtered under nitrogen and the residue on the filter is dried in vacuum thoroughly.<br>
Hydrogenation of Imine using heterogeneous catalyst prepared as above is as follows:<br>
The method for hydrogenation of imines comprises adding the catalyst to the imine<br>
solution in acetic acid in an autoclave and flushing it with nitrogen; followed by flushing<br>
with hydrogen and raising the hydrogen pressure to about 80 bar, temperature about 50 °C<br>
and keeping the mass under stirring.<br>
On completion of the reaction the reaction mass is filtered to get the hydrogenated product<br>
in the filtrate; and catalyst as residue on the filter.<br>
The acetic acid is distilling off by adding toluene, under vacuum at 60 °C followed by<br>
distilling the hydrogenated product remaining in the still under high vacuum at 70 C to get<br>
the pure product;<br>
The catalyst from the residue on the filter is recovered by washing with methanol and<br>
drying in high vacuum.<br>
This recovered catalyst is reusable several times and has the activity and selectivity as that<br>
of the original.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention is described a process of preparing 2-chloro-N-(2-<br>
ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(lS)-2-methoxy-l-methylethyl] acetamide of Formula (I)<br>
comprising step i hydrogenation of methyl-ethyl-aniline(MEA)imine of Formula (II) to<br>
(S)-N-(2'-methyl-6'-ethyl-phen-r-yl) -N-(l-methoxymethyl)ethylamine of the Formula<br>
(III) using the catalyst of the present invention and step ii. reacting the hydrogenated<br>
product obtained with chloroacetyl chloride in toluene and a base, at temperature 0 - 5 °C<br>
followed by the recovery of the product by washing the reaction mass free of base; drying<br>
it free of water and separating the organic layer and distilling off the solvent under<br>
vacuum.<br>
