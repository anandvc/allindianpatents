				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TRANSMITTING APPARATUS, TRANSMITTING METHOD, RECEIVING APPARATUS AND RECEIVING METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile<br>
communications field of technology, and specifically to a<br>
transmission apparatus, a transmission method, a reception<br>
apparatus, and a reception method for use in an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) method mobile<br>
communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A future mobile communications system that mainly<br>
carries out image or data communications requires<br>
capabilities far beyond the capability of the conventional<br>
mobile communications system (for example, an IMT-2000-based<br>
system) . To this end, higher capacity, higher speed, broader<br>
band or the like have to be realized.<br>
In a broadband mobile communications system, frequency<br>
selective fading caused by a multi-path transmission<br>
environment tends to be problematic, which makes an OFDM<br>
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) method be<br>
considered promising as a method of the next generation<br>
communications system. In the OFDM method, guard intervals<br>
are added to active symbols including information to be<br>
transmitted so as to produce symbols, which are in turn<br>
transmitted one by one at predetermined transmission time<br>
intervals (TTIs). Here, plural TTIs compose one frame. In<br>
addition, the guard interval is generated using part of<br>
information included in the active symbol. The guard<br>
interval may be called a cyclic prefix (CP) in some cases.<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
FIG. 1 shows a relationship among the frame, the TTI, and<br>
the symbol. Since a receiver receives signals with various<br>
transmission delays, inter-symbol interference is caused.<br>
However, in the OFDM method, such inter-symbol interference<br>
can be sufficiently suppressed as long as the transmission<br>
delays fall within a time length of the guard interval.<br>
During a time period of one TTI, various channels are<br>
transmitted. The channels may include a common pilot channel,<br>
a shared control channel, and a shared data channel. The<br>
common pilot channel is used by plural users to demodulate<br>
the shared control channel. Specifically, the common pilot<br>
channel is used for channel estimation, synchronous<br>
detection, reception signal quality measurement, or the like.<br>
The shared control channel is used to demodulate the shared<br>
data channel including payload (or traffic information<br>
channel). Regarding conventional signal formats including<br>
the pilot channel, see non-patent document 1, for example.<br>
[Non-patent document 1] Keiji Tachikawa, "W-CDMA<br>
mobile communications method", MARUZEN Co., Ltd., pp.<br>
100-101.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
By the way, the TTI is used to define various units<br>
in information transmission. For example, the TTI<br>
determines a transmission unit of a packet, an update unit<br>
of data-modulating and channel-coding in Modulation and<br>
Coding Scheme (MCS), a unit of error correction coding, a<br>
retransmission unit of Automatic Repeat request (ARQ), a<br>
packet scheduling unit, or the like. Under such<br>
circumstances, the TTI length and thus the frame length<br>
should be maintained constant. However, the number of<br>
symbols included in the TTI may be optionally changed<br>
- 2 —<br><br>
depending on application or system.<br>
The common pilot channel is allocated to one or more<br>
symbols in the TTI, and a control channel or a data channel<br>
is allocated to other symbols in the same TTI in various<br>
conventional transmission methods. When it is assumed that<br>
one symbol is occupied by the common pilot channel while the<br>
TTI is composed of ten symbols, the common pilot channel<br>
occupies 10 % of the TTI (1/10) . On the other hand, when it<br>
is assumed that one symbol is occupied by the common pilot<br>
channel while the TTI is composed of five symbols, the common<br>
pilot occupies as much as 20 % of the TTI (1/5) . Therefore,<br>
reduction of the number of the symbols included in the TTI<br>
leads to a problem of reduced transmission efficiency of the<br>
data channel. Such a problem becomes significant especially<br>
when the number of the symbols in the TTI is reduced.<br>
The present invention has been made to address the above<br>
problem, and is directed to a transmission apparatus, a<br>
transmission method, a reception apparatus, and a reception<br>
method in which the data channel transmission efficiency can<br>
be maintained or improved even when the number of the symbols<br>
included in the TTI is reduced.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
An embodiment according to the present invention<br>
provides a transmission apparatus that includes a<br>
multiplexing portion that multiplexes a common pilot channel,<br>
a shared control channel, and a shared data channel; a symbol<br>
generation portion that performs an inverse Fourier<br>
transformation on the multiplexed signal so as to generate<br>
a symbol; and a transmission portion that transmits the<br>
generated symbol. In this embodiment, the multiplexing<br>
portion multiplexes in a frequency direction the shared<br>
control channel including control information necessary for<br>
— 3 —<br><br>
demodulation of the shared data channel including a payload<br>
and the common pilot channel to be used by plural users, and<br>
also multiplexes the shared data channel in a time direction<br>
with respect to both the common pilot channel and the shared<br>
control channel. Even when the number of symbols composing<br>
the transmission time interval (TTI) is reduced,<br>
transmission efficiency of channels excluding the common<br>
pilot channel can be maintained by reducing insertion<br>
intervals of the common pilot channel accordingly.<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the data channel<br>
transmission efficiency can be maintained or improved even<br>
when the number of the symbols included in the TTI is reduced.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a<br>
common pilot channel and a shared data channel are<br>
time-multiplexed, and a common control channel and a data<br>
channel are also time-multiplexed. Since the common pilot<br>
channel is allocated not to an entire frequency band but to<br>
part of the frequency band or part of sub-carriers, other<br>
channels excluding the common pilot channel are allocated<br>
to other sub-carriers in the symbol. By adjusting an<br>
insertion position of the common pilot channel in a frequency<br>
direction, the ratio of the common pilot channel in relation<br>
to the symbol can also be adjusted. Therefore, even when the<br>
number of symbols composing the TTI is reduced (and a time<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
period of one symbol becomes longer), transmission<br>
efficiencies of other channels excluding the common pilot<br>
channel can be maintained by reducing the number (frequency)<br>
of the inserted common pilot channels accordingly.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention,<br>
a dedicated pilot channel to be used by one or more specific<br>
users to demodulate the shared data channel and a combination<br>
of the common pilot channel and the shared control channel<br>
are multiplexed in a time direction. By estimating channels<br>
using the dedicated pilot channel in addition to the common<br>
pilot channel, channel estimation accuracy or the like will<br>
be improved.<br>
The dedicated pilot channel is time-multiplexed at a<br>
first point of time at constant frequency intervals and also<br>
time-multiplexed at a second time at the constant frequency<br>
intervals. By dispersing the pilot channels in the time and<br>
the frequency direction, a diversity effect of the pilot<br>
channel can be improved while transmission efficiency of<br>
channels excluding the pilot channel is improved.<br>
The dedicated pilot channel is transmitted to a<br>
communications party that moves at a higher moving velocity<br>
but not necessarily transmitted to a communications party<br>
that does not move at a higher moving velocity. By<br>
transmitting the dedicated pilot channel to only a user whose<br>
channel fluctuation is considered to be large in the time<br>
direction, unnecessary transmission of the dedicated<br>
transmission channel can be avoided.<br>
A beam directionality adjuster that adjusts<br>
directionality of the transmission beam toward a specific<br>
communications party may be provided in a transmission<br>
apparatus. The dedicated pilot channel may be inserted for<br>
a specific communications party. When the directional beam<br>
is used, channel qualities are different from beam to beam.<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
By utilizing the dedicated pilot channel directed toward the<br>
specific communications party in addition to the common pilot<br>
channel, channel estimation accuracy is improved.<br>
When the MIMO multiplexing method is used, the pilot<br>
channel may be transmitted from one or more transmission<br>
antennas and the dedicated pilot channel may be transmitted<br>
from another one or more transmission antennas, which allows<br>
for appropriate MIMO multiplexing transmission depending on<br>
the class of a reception apparatus (specifically, the number<br>
of reception antennas).<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a reception apparatus having a reception<br>
portion that receives a symbol transmitted from a transmitter,<br>
a transformation portion that performs the Fourier<br>
transformation on the received symbol, and a separation<br>
portion that separates a common pilot channel, a shared<br>
control channel, and a shared data channel from the<br>
transformed signal. The separation portion<br>
frequency-separates the common pilot channel used by plural<br>
users to demodulate the shared control channel and the shared<br>
control channel used to demodulate the shared data channel,<br>
and time-separates the shared data channel including a<br>
payload and a combination of the common pilot channel and<br>
the shared control channel.<br>
In a transmission apparatus according to another aspect<br>
of the present invention, the common pilot channel is<br>
multiplied by a spreading code sequence (scramble code)<br>
common to plural sectors and an orthogonal code sequence<br>
which is different from sector to sector, and the resultant<br>
signal is transmitted to a communications party (typically,<br>
a mobile station). Since one sector is distinguished from<br>
the other sectors by not the scramble code but the orthogonal<br>
code, distinguishing sectors is easily and highly accurately<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
carried out, thereby improving quality of the pilot channel.<br>
Other channels excluding the common pilot channel may<br>
be multiplied by the spreading code sequence (scramble code)<br>
common to plural sectors and the orthogonal code sequence<br>
which is different from sector to sector.<br>
From a spreading code sequence common to plural sectors,<br>
another spreading code is derived in accordance with a<br>
predetermined rule, and the derived spreading code may<br>
multiply other channels excluding the pilot channel. With<br>
this, while different scramble codes are used for the pilot<br>
channel and other channels, those scramble codes can be<br>
readily detected by using the deriving rule.<br>
The pilot channel and the shared control channel may<br>
be multiplied by the spreading code sequence (scramble code)<br>
common to plural sectors and the orthogonal code sequence<br>
which is different from sector to sector, and the shared data<br>
channel may be multiplied by another spreading code. With<br>
this, scramble codes can be used accordingly from the<br>
viewpoint of, for example, a change in a spreading factor.<br>
In the following examples, although the present<br>
invention is described in the context of a system employing<br>
the OFDM method in downlink, other systems employing, for<br>
example, a multi-carrier method may be used.<br><example><br>
FIG. 2 shows a part of a transmitter according to a<br>
first example of the present invention. Although this<br>
transmitter is typically provided in a radio base station<br>
of a mobile communications system as described in this<br>
example, the transmitter may be provided in other apparatuses.<br>
The transmitter has plural data channel processing portions<br>
202-1 to 101-K, the number of which is K, a common pilot<br>
multiplexing portion 204, an IFFT portion 206, and a guard<br>
interval insertion portion 208. Since the K data channel<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
processing portions 202-1 to 202-K have identical functions<br>
and configurations, a first data channel processing portion<br>
202-1 represents the others in the following explanation.<br>
The data channel processing portion 202-1 has a spreading<br>
and channel coding portion 210, an interleaving portion 212,<br>
a data modulation portion 214, and a time and frequency<br>
mapping portion 216.<br>
The data channel processing portion 202-1 processes<br>
a data channel for a first user. While one data channel<br>
processing portion carries out a process for one user for<br>
simplicity of explanation, plural data channel processing<br>
portions may be used for one user.<br>
The spreading and channel coding portion 210 performs<br>
channel coding on the data channel to be transmitted, thereby<br>
enhancing error correction capability. It should be noted<br>
that code spreading is not performed in this particular<br>
example because the OFDM method is employed. However, when<br>
an OFCDM (Orthogonal Frequency and Code Division<br>
Multiplexing) method is employed in other examples, the<br>
spreading and channel coding portion 210 conducts both the<br>
channel coding and the code spreading on the data channel<br>
to be transmitted. The channel coding may be turbo coding.<br>
The interleaving portion 212 changes the order of<br>
symbols of the channel-coded signal in a time direction<br>
and/or a frequency direction in accordance with a<br>
predetermined rule known by the transmitter and its<br>
corresponding receiver.<br>
The data modulation portion 214 maps the signal to be<br>
transmitted in a signal constellation in accordance with an<br>
appropriate modulation method. As the modulation method,<br>
various modulation methods such as QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM or the<br>
like may be employed. When Adaptive Modulation and Coding<br>
Scheme (AMCS) is employed, the modulation method and a<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
channel coding rate are assigned on a case-by-case basis.<br>
The time and frequency mapping portion 216 determines<br>
how the data channels to be transmitted are mapped in the<br>
time and/or the frequency direction.<br>
The common pilot multiplexing portion 204 multiplexes<br>
the common pilot channels, the shared control channels, and<br>
the data channels, and outputs the multiplexed channels. The<br>
multiplexing may be made in the time direction, in the<br>
frequency direction, or in both the time and the frequency<br>
directions.<br>
The IFFT portion 206 performs the Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation on the signal to be transmitted, or the<br>
modulation according to the OFDM method, which forms an<br>
active symbol portion.<br>
The guard interval insertion portion 208 extracts a<br>
part of the active symbol and adds the extracted part to a<br>
top or end of the active symbol, thereby forming a<br>
transmission symbol (transmission signal).<br>
The data channel processing portions 202-1 through<br>
202-K process the data channels to be transmitted to the<br>
corresponding users. In the data channel processing<br>
portions 202-1 to 202-K, the data channels are channel-coded,<br>
interleaved, data-modulated, and mapped in the<br>
time/frequency directions. The mapped data channels are<br>
output from the corresponding data channel processing<br>
portions 202-1 to 202-K and input to the common pilot<br>
multiplexing portion 204, in which the data channels are<br>
multiplexed with the common pilot channels and the shared<br>
control channels. The multiplexed signal undergoes the<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation, and a guard interval<br>
is added to the transformed signal (the active symbol<br>
portion), thereby forming the transmission symbol. The<br>
transmission symbol is transmitted via a radio portion (not<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
shown).<br>
FIG. 3 shows a part of a receiver according to this<br>
example of the present invention. While this receiver is<br>
provided in a mobile station (for example, user equipment<br>
of a user #1) of the mobile communications system as shown<br>
in this example, the receiver may be provided in other<br>
apparatuses. The receiver has a guard interval removal<br>
portion 302, an FFT portion 304, a common pilot separation<br>
portion 306, a channel estimation portion 308, a dedicated<br>
pilot separation portion 310, a time and frequency data<br>
extraction portion 312, a data demodulation portion 314, a<br>
deinterleaving portion 316, and a despreading and channel<br>
decoding portion 318.<br>
The guard interval removal portion 302 removes the<br>
guard interval from the transmitted symbol and thus extracts<br>
the active symbol portion.<br>
The FFT portion 304 performs the Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation on the signal, or demodulation according to<br>
the OFDM method.<br>
The common pilot separation portion 306 separates every<br>
sub-carrier demodulated in accordance with the OFDM method<br>
so as to obtain the common pilot channels, the shared control<br>
channels, and other channels.<br>
The channel estimation portion 308 performs channel<br>
estimation using the separated common pilot channels and<br>
outputs to the data demodulation portion 314 or the like a<br>
control signal for channel compensation. Such control<br>
signal is also used for the channel compensation for the<br>
shared control channels, though not shown for simplicity of<br>
illustration.<br>
The dedicated pilot separation portion 310 is not used<br>
in this example but used to separate the dedicated pilot<br>
channels from the other channels in a below-described example.<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
The dedicated pilot channels are given to the channel<br>
estimation portion 308 and used in order to enhance the<br>
channel estimation accuracy.<br>
The time and frequency data extraction portion 312<br>
extracts the data channels in accordance with the mapping<br>
rule determined by the transmitter and outputs the extracted<br>
data channels.<br>
The data demodulation portion 314 performs channel<br>
compensation and then demodulation on the data channels. The<br>
modulation method is in accordance with the modulation method<br>
performed in the transmitter.<br>
The deinterleaving portion 316 changes the order of<br>
the symbol of the data channels in accordance with the<br>
interleaving performed in the transmitter.<br>
The despreading and channel coding portion 318 performs<br>
channel decoding on the received data channels. Since the<br>
OFDM method is employed, code despreading is not performed<br>
in this example. However, when the OFCDM method is employed<br>
in other examples, the despreading and channel decoding<br>
portion 318 conducts both the code despreading and the<br>
channel decoding on the received data channels.<br>
A signal received by an antenna (not shown) passes<br>
through a radio portion (not shown) , is converted into a base<br>
band signal, and undergoes the guard interval removal and<br>
the Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation. From the<br>
transformed signal is separated the common pilot channels,<br>
which are used in the channel estimation. Additionally, the<br>
shared control channels and the data channels are separated<br>
from the transformed signal and then demodulated. The<br>
demodulated data channels are deinterleaved and<br>
channel-decoded, and thus the data that have been transmitted<br>
from the transmitter are restored.<br>
FIG. 4 shows how various channels are multiplexed in<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
this example. As an example, 20 TTIs are included in a 10<br>
ms frame, which means one TTI is 0.5 ms. One TTI is composed<br>
of 7 symbols arranged along the time direction (ND=7).<br>
In the illustrated example, the common pilot channels,<br>
the shared control channels, the dedicated pilot channels,<br>
and the data channels are multiplexed. The dedicated pilot<br>
channels are described in a second example and beyond. The<br>
common pilot channels and the shared control channels are<br>
frequency-multiplexed in one symbol. Specifically, the<br>
common pilot channels are inserted at certain frequency<br>
intervals into a leading symbol of the TTI. On the other hand,<br>
the shared data channels are transmitted by a second symbol<br>
and beyond in the same TTI. Namely, the common pilot channels<br>
and the shared data channels are time-multiplexed, and the<br>
shared control channels and the data channels are also<br>
time-multiplexed. Since the common pilot channels are<br>
allocated not to the entire frequency band in the TTI but<br>
to a part of the frequency band or a part of the sub-carriers,<br>
other channels excluding the common pilot channels can be<br>
allocated to the other sub-carriers. By adjusting insertion<br>
intervals of the common pilot channels in the frequency<br>
direction, the ratio of the common pilot channels in relation<br>
to the TTI can be adjusted. For example, when the number of<br>
the symbols in the TTI is reduced (and a time period per symbol<br>
becomes longer accordingly), channel transmission<br>
efficiency of the channels excluding the common pilot<br>
channels can be maintained by accordingly reducing insertion<br>
frequencies of the common pilot channels.<br>
FIG. 5 shows various examples of channel configurations<br>
in which the common pilot channels and the shared control<br>
channels are multiplexed. It should be noted that the<br>
channel configurations are not limited to the illustrated<br>
examples but are realized into yet another configuration.<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
A channel configuration 1 shown in FIG. 5 is the same as the<br>
channel configuration shown in FIG. 4. As stated, the common<br>
pilot channels are used for the channel estimation to<br>
demodulate the shared control channels. In the channel<br>
configuration 1, since the common pilot channels and the<br>
shared control channels are frequency-multiplexed, there are<br>
no common pilot channels for the sub-carrier that contains<br>
the shared control channels and therefore a channel<br>
estimation value cannot be directly obtained for the shared<br>
control channels in the channel configuration 1. Therefore,<br>
the channel estimation value for the shared control channel<br>
has to be obtained by interpolating the channel estimation<br>
values for the sub-carriers that contain the common pilot<br>
channels. The interpolation may be a linear interpolation.<br>
By the way, bi-directional arrows in FIG. 5 indicate that<br>
the interpolation is carried out in the marked section. In<br>
this particular example, since all the common pilot channels<br>
and the shared control channels are allocated to the leading<br>
symbol, demodulation of the shared data channels can be<br>
carried out quickly. In addition, since the common pilot<br>
channels and the shared control channels are distributed<br>
widely in the frequency direction, a frequency diversity<br>
effect can be improved and resilience to frequency selective<br>
fading can be enhanced.<br>
In a channel configuration 2, the common pilot channels<br>
and the shared control channels are time-multiplexed. In<br>
this configuration, no interpolation is necessary in<br>
contrast to the channel configuration 1. In addition, the<br>
common pilot channels and the shared control channels are<br>
distributed widely in the frequency direction, thereby<br>
enhancing resilience to the frequency selective fading.<br>
In a channel configuration 3, the shared control<br>
channels are inserted after a part of the common pilot<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
channels but not after the other common pilot channels. The<br>
common pilot channels and the shared control channels<br>
multiplexed in the time direction allow for power ratio<br>
adjustment during transmission. In this configuration,<br>
since the shared control channels are inserted so as to<br>
substantially cover the TTI in the time direction, the<br>
channel estimation throughout the entire TTI is necessary.<br>
In this case, if only the common pilot channels in the leading<br>
symbol are used for the channel estimation, the channel<br>
estimation accuracy for the end symbol is not sufficiently<br>
assured. The situation becomes worse especially when the<br>
receiver is moving at a higher moving velocity since channel<br>
fluctuation in the time direction tends to be rather large<br>
in this case. Therefore, the channel estimation value<br>
obtained from the leading symbol in the TTI and the channel<br>
estimation value obtained from the end symbol in the TTI are<br>
used (for example, linearly interpolated) so as to preferably<br>
perform the channel estimation.<br>
In a channel configuration 4, the shared control<br>
channels are multiplexed by frequency hopping in the time<br>
and the frequency directions. Since the common pilot<br>
channels and the shared control channels are distributed<br>
widely in the frequency direction, the resilience to the<br>
frequency selective fading can be enhanced. In addition,<br>
since the common pilot channels and the shared control<br>
channels are distributed also in the time direction, the<br>
power ratio can be adjusted during transmission.<br><example><br>
In a second example of the present invention, the<br>
dedicated pilot channels are used in addition to the common<br>
pilot channels. These channels are the same in that these<br>
channels are used for the channel estimation or the like.<br>
However, these channels are different in that the dedicated<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
pilot channels are used only for a particular mobile station<br>
while the common pilot channels are used for all the mobile<br>
stations. Therefore, while only one kind of signal may be<br>
prepared as a signal indicating the common channel, plural<br>
kinds of signals have to be prepared as signals indicating<br>
the dedicated pilot channels, the number of which is larger<br>
than the number of the mobile phones. The dedicated pilot<br>
channels are used when the mobile phones move at higher moving<br>
velocity, when a directional beam is used in downlink, and<br>
when the mobile stations have the predetermined number of<br>
reception antennas, or the like, the details of which are<br>
explained below.<br>
FIG. 6 shows various channel configurations including<br>
the dedicated pilot channels. The channel configurations<br>
are not limited to the illustrated configurations but may<br>
be realized in any other configuration. In a channel<br>
configuration 1 of FIG. 6, the dedicated pilot channels are<br>
inserted in a second symbol at predetermined intervals. In<br>
a channel configuration 2 of FIG. 6, the dedicated pilot<br>
channels are inserted in a frequency hopping pattern both<br>
in the time and the frequency directions. In a channel<br>
configuration 3 of FIG. 3, the dedicated pilot channels are<br>
time-multiplexed after a part of the common pilot channels<br>
but not after the other common pilot channels. In a channel<br>
configuration 4 of FIG. 6, the dedicated pilot channels and<br>
the shared data channels are code-multiplexed.<br>
Regarding the common pilot channels and the dedicated<br>
pilot channels, when the channel estimation is carried out<br>
in the time domain, insertion intervals Δp of the pilot<br>
channels are required to satisfy the sampling theorem.<br>
Specifically, the insertion intervals Δp are set so as to<br>
satisfy the following relationship:<br>
- 18 -<br><br><br>
where Ts represents a time period of the active symbol portion<br>
(a symbol time period obtained after the guard interval<br>
removal) and dmax represents the maximum value of path<br>
propagation delay, the relationship of which is illustrated<br>
in FIG. 7. For example, when Ts and dmax are equal to 80 µs<br>
and 20 µs, respectively, the insertion intervals have to be<br>
4 or below.<br><example><br>
FIG. 8 shows a part of transmitter according to a third<br>
example of the present invention. In FIG. 8, like numerals<br>
are given to the elements that have been already explained<br>
in reference to FIG. 2 . As shown, the data channel processing<br>
portion 202-1 additionally has a dedicated pilot channel<br>
control portion 72 and a dedicated pilot channel multiplexing<br>
portion 74. These elements are provided in the other data<br>
channel processing portions 202-2 to 202-K. The dedicated<br>
pilot channel control portion 72 determines, in accordance<br>
with mobility of a mobile station concerned, whether the<br>
dedicated pilot channels are inserted into a signal to be<br>
transmitted to the mobile station. The mobility may be<br>
measured, for example, through the maximum Doppler frequency.<br>
When the measured mobility exceeds a predetermined level,<br>
the dedicated pilot channels may be inserted. The dedicated<br>
pilot multiplexing portion 74 inserts or does not insert the<br>
dedicated pilot channels to the signal to be transmitted to<br>
the user in accordance with instruction from the dedicated<br>
pilot channel control portion 72, and outputs the signal with<br>
or without the dedicated pilot channels to the common pilot<br>
multiplexing portion 204.<br>
For example, the mobile station shown in FIG. 3 notifies<br>
the radio base station of any indication that can be used<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
by the radio base station to determine whether the mobile<br>
station is moving at a higher speed. Such indication may be,<br>
but not limited to, the maximum Doppler frequency. When it<br>
is determined by the dedicated pilot channel control portion<br>
72 that the mobile station is moving at a higher moving<br>
velocity, the dedicated pilot channels are multiplexed with<br>
the signal in the dedicated pilot multiplexing portion 74.<br>
When it is determined to the contrary, the dedicated pilot<br>
channels are not multiplexed. In this example, the dedicated<br>
pilot channels are inserted to the signal to be transmitted<br>
to the fast-moving mobile station, whereas the dedicated<br>
pilot channels are not inserted to the signal to be<br>
transmitted to the slowly moving or stationary mobile station.<br>
The dedicated pilot channels in addition to the common pilot<br>
channels are used in the fast-moving mobile station, thereby<br>
enhancing the channel estimation accuracy.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an example of a channel configuration when<br>
the frequency band is divided into plural frequency blocks.<br>
One frequency block includes plural sub-carriers. Such a<br>
frequency block may be called a chunk, a frequency chunk,<br>
or a resource block. A user can use one chunk or more in<br>
accordance with transmission contents (data size or the like).<br>
In the illustrated example, a frequency chunk 1 is used by<br>
a fast-moving user and the shared data channels and the<br>
dedicated pilot channels are multiplexed in the chunk 1. In<br>
addition, anther frequency chunk 2 is used by a user who is<br>
not moving fast, and the dedicated pilot channels are not<br>
multiplexed in the chunk 2. In the case of the fast-moving<br>
mobile station, since the channel estimation value may change<br>
largely from time to time, both the common pilot channels<br>
and the dedicated pilot channels are used, thereby obtaining<br>
the highly accurate channel estimation value. On the other<br>
hand, in the case of the stationary or slowly moving mobile<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
station, the channel estimation value is not expected to<br>
change largely from time to time. Transmitting the common<br>
pilot channels and the dedicated pilot channels to such a<br>
user may result in impaired data transmission efficiency<br>
since the unnecessary pilot channels are transmitted.<br>
However, the dedicated pilot channel estimation portion 72<br>
detects the mobility of the mobile station and determines<br>
whether the dedicated pilot channels are required in<br>
accordance with the detected mobility in this example,<br>
thereby preventing wasteful transmission of the dedicated<br>
pilot channels.<br><example><br>
FIG. 10 shows a part of transmitter according to a<br>
fourth example of the present invention. In FIG. 10, like<br>
numerals are given to the elements that have been already<br>
explained in reference to FIG. 2. In this example, plural<br>
antennas are used for signal transmission. Therefore, the<br>
data channel processing portion 202-1 is provided<br>
additionally with a dedicated pilot multiplexing portion 102,<br>
an antenna weight control portion 104, and a weight setting<br>
portion. Moreover, each of the plural antennas is provided<br>
with elements such as the common pilot multiplexing portion<br>
204, the IFFT portion 206 and the guard interval insertion<br>
portion 208, or the like. The dedicated pilot multiplexing<br>
portion 102 multiplexes the dedicated pilot channels in the<br>
signal to be transmitted. The antenna weight control portion<br>
104 adjusts a weight for each of the plural antennas.<br>
Adjusting appropriately the weight realizes a beam pattern<br>
that has directionality in a specific direction or no<br>
directivity. The weight setting portion 106 sets the weight<br>
for each transmission antenna in accordance with a control<br>
signal from the antenna weight control portion 104. The<br>
weight is typically expressed by an amount of phase rotation<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
to which amplitude may be added.<br>
By the way, the common pilot channels and the shared<br>
control channels need to be provided to all the users, whereas<br>
the dedicated pilot channels need to be provided to a specific<br>
user. Therefore, the common pilot channels and the shared<br>
control channels are transmitted by a sector beam that covers<br>
an entire sector and the dedicated pilot channels are<br>
transmitted by a directional beam having directionality<br>
toward the user. FIG. 11 shows schematically the sector beam<br>
and the directional beams. In FIG. 11, the sector beam<br>
covering the entire sector having a wide directional angle<br>
of 120 degree is shown by a solid line, whereas the directional<br>
beams having a narrower directivity toward a user 1 and a<br>
user 2, respectively are shown by dotted lines.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an example of a channel configuration<br>
when the frequency band is divided into plural frequency<br>
blocks or chunks. One user can use one chunk or more in<br>
accordance with transmission contents (data size or the like).<br>
In the illustrated example, a frequency chunk 1 is used by<br>
the user 1 and a frequency chunk 2 is used by the user 2.<br>
Since each user can use the dedicated pilot channels<br>
transmitted by the directional beam, in addition to the<br>
common pilot channels transmitted throughout the sector, the<br>
channel estimation regarding the direction of the<br>
directional beam is carried out with high accuracy.<br><example><br>
In the Example 4, the plural transmission antennas are<br>
used to form one directional beam. On the other hand, in a<br>
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) method, while plural<br>
antennas are independently used so as to concurrently<br>
transmit different signals from the corresponding antennas<br>
at the same frequency, the signals are received by plural<br>
reception antennas and separated using an appropriate signal<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
separation algorithm. Independent use of the plural<br>
transmission antennas can produce plural transmission routes<br>
(channels), thereby enhancing a data transmission rate up<br>
to a level corresponding to a factor of the number of the<br>
transmission antennas. Since the transmission routes are<br>
formed by the corresponding antennas, the pilot channels are<br>
transmitted from the corresponding antennas and the channel<br>
estimation is carried out for the corresponding antennas.<br>
In addition, the transmissions need to be carried out in<br>
accordance with the least number of the antennas when the<br>
number NTX of the transmission antennas and the number NRX of<br>
the reception antennas are different. For example, when a<br>
radio base station transmits signals from four antennas, a<br>
transmission rate that has been expected from the use of the<br>
four antennas cannot be realized if a mobile station has only<br>
two reception antennas, leading to throughput that can be<br>
realized by only the two of the four transmission antennas.<br>
In other words, if the mobile station has only two antennas,<br>
use of the four antennas in the radio base station cannot<br>
contribute to an improvement of the data transmission<br>
efficiency. From this point of view, a way of transmission<br>
from the radio base station is changed in accordance with<br>
the number of the reception antennas provided in the mobile<br>
station in the fifth example of the present invention.<br>
It is assumed for simplicity of explanation that the<br>
mobile station has two or four antennas and the radio base<br>
station has four antennas, although this example is<br>
applicable to the mobile station and the radio base station<br>
having any appropriate number of antennas. In this example,<br>
the common pilot channels and the shared control channels<br>
are received by any type of mobile station and the dedicated<br>
pilot channels are received by the mobile station having the<br>
four antennas.<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
FIG. 13 schematically shows the MIMO method according<br>
to this example of the present invention. As shown, the<br>
common pilot channels (and the shared control channels) are<br>
transmitted from a first antenna and a second antenna of a<br>
transmitter (radio base station) . The common pilot channels<br>
are used by all mobile stations. In addition, the dedicated<br>
pilot channels are transmitted from a third antenna and a<br>
fourth antenna. The dedicated pilot channels are used only<br>
by a receiver (mobile station) having the four antennas.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an example of a channel configuration<br>
when the frequency band is divided into plural frequency<br>
blocks or chunks. One user can use one chunk or more in<br>
accordance with transmission contents (data size or the like) .<br>
In the illustrated example, a frequency chunk 1 is used by<br>
a user 2 and a frequency chunk 2 is used by a user 1. The<br>
common pilot channels and the shared control channels in the<br>
leading slot of the TTI are transmitted from the first and<br>
the second transmission antennas . A second symbol and beyond<br>
in the frequency chunk 2 are used to transmit the shared data<br>
channels to the user 1 having only the two antennas. The<br>
second symbol and beyond in the frequency chunk 1 are used<br>
to transmit the dedicated pilot channels from the third and<br>
the fourth antennas to the user 2 having the four antennas.<br>
With this, throughput can be improved for the user 1 and the<br>
user 2.<br>
FIG. 15 shows several multiplexing methods about the<br>
common pilot channels. However, various multiplexing<br>
methods rather than the shown methods are applicable to this<br>
example of the present invention. In a method 1, the common<br>
pilot channels are multiplexed only in the frequency<br>
direction, which corresponds to the multiplexing method<br>
shown in FIG. 14. In a method 2, the common pilot channels<br>
are multiplexed in the time and the frequency directions.<br>
- 24 -<br><br>
In a method 3, the common pilot channels are multiplexed only<br>
in the time direction.<br><example><br>
Downlink pilot channels can be divided into the common<br>
pilot channels and the dedicated pilot channels. The common<br>
pilot channels may be transmitted by the sector beam or a<br>
multi-beam due to a fixed antenna weight (a fixed beam<br>
pattern) using plural antennas . When the multi-beam is used,<br>
the entire sector is covered by a predetermined number of<br>
directional beams.<br>
(Pilot Channel)<br>
The common pilot channels may be used to identify a<br>
sector to which a user concerned belongs out of plural sectors<br>
in the same cell. All the sectors in the same cell use<br>
cell-specific scramble codes. The common pilot channels may<br>
be used for cell-search or handover, or for measurement of<br>
reference level in adjacent cells/sectors. In addition, the<br>
common pilot channels may be used for quality measurement<br>
to obtain channel quality information (CQI) for the purpose<br>
of scheduling in accordance with instantaneous channel<br>
quality. The CQI may be used, for example, in an adaptive<br>
link control. The common pilot channels may be used for<br>
channel estimation of a physical channel transmitted by the<br>
sector beam or the multi-beam.<br>
The dedicated pilot channels may be transmitted by the<br>
sector beam or the multi-beam, or by an adaptive beam<br>
(adaptive directional beam) produced adaptively for each<br>
user. The adaptive directional beam and the directional beam<br>
included in the multi-beam are the same in that the beams<br>
have a strong antenna gain in a particular direction.<br>
However, the directional beam is produced at a fixed weight<br>
whereas the weight of the adaptive directional beam is<br>
changed in accordance with a position of the mobile station.<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
Namely, the directional beam is a fixed directional beam and<br>
the adaptive directional beam is a variable directional beam<br>
whose directionality is variable. The dedicated pilot<br>
channels are used (though not always used) in accordance with<br>
transmission channel quality that is dependent on the user<br>
or an environment. The dedicated pilot channels may be<br>
transmitted by the adaptive beam produced adaptively for each<br>
user. The dedicated pilot channels may be used to assist the<br>
channel estimation of the physical channel transmitted by<br>
the sector beam or the multi-beam, although the common pilot<br>
channels are basically used for the channel estimation. The<br>
dedicated pilot channels may be used for the channel<br>
estimation of the physical channel transmitted by the<br>
adaptive beam. The dedicated pilot channels may be used for<br>
the CQI measurement of the physical channel transmitted by<br>
the adaptive beam.<br>
FIG. 16 shows an example of a channel configuration<br>
of the common pilot channels and the dedicated pilot channels.<br>
In the illustrated example, the common pilot channels are<br>
mapped in sub-carriers at predetermined frequency intervals<br>
in one symbol (or one time slot). On the other hand, the<br>
dedicated pilot channels are mapped in other sub-carriers<br>
at predetermined frequency intervals in another symbol or<br>
more. By the way, the common pilot channels may be mapped<br>
in one symbol or more.<br>
(Beam)<br>
The common pilot channels may be transmitted by the<br>
sector beam and used for demodulation of the physical channel,<br>
namely for the channel estimation and reception<br>
synchronization. In addition, the common pilot channels may<br>
be transmitted from a MIMO-based transmitter . Moreover, the<br>
dedicated pilot channels may be additionally used in<br>
accordance with the user or the environment so as to improve<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
the channel estimation accuracy. When a specific chunk used<br>
for the shared data channels is used only by one or a few<br>
users, the dedicated pilot channels may be additionally used<br>
in accordance with the transmission environment of the user<br>
(a moving velocity, a delay spread, a received<br>
Signal-to-Interference plus Noise power Ratio (SINR) , or the<br>
like), thereby further improving the channel estimation<br>
accuracy. In a multicast/broadcast channel, the dedicated<br>
pilot channels are additionally used taking account of a user<br>
in the worst transmission environment in the cell concerned,<br>
thereby improving the channel estimation accuracy. On the<br>
other hand, the reference level measurement for the<br>
cell-search or the handover and the CQI measurement for the<br>
scheduling, the adaptive link control, or the like are<br>
carried out principally using the common pilot channels may<br>
be carried out supplementarily using the dedicated pilot<br>
channels.<br>
The common pilot channels may be used for demodulation<br>
of the physical channel transmitted by the multi-beam, namely<br>
for the channel estimation and reception synchronization.<br>
In addition, as is the case with the sector beam, the dedicated<br>
pilot channels may be additionally used in accordance with<br>
the user or the environment, thereby improving the channel<br>
estimation accuracy. On the other hand, the reference level<br>
measurement for the cell-search or the handover and the CQI<br>
measurement for the scheduling, the adaptive link control,<br>
or the like are carried out principally using the common pilot<br>
channels and may be carried out supplementarily using the<br>
dedicated pilot channels. When there are a large number of<br>
multi-beams in the same cell, pilot sequences to be used for<br>
identifying a beam to which a particular user belongs may<br>
be re-used in the same cell, thereby reducing the number of<br>
the pilot sequences to be used.<br>
- 27 -<br><br>
FIG. 17 schematically shows the pilot channels<br>
transmitted by the multi-beam. In the illustrated example,<br>
five directional beams (fixed beam patterns) are used. A<br>
pilot sequence is re-used by two directional beams that are<br>
directed in largely different directions among the five<br>
beams.<br>
Since the adaptive (directional) beam forms adaptively<br>
transmission beams for the corresponding users, the<br>
dedicated pilot channels are used for the channel estimation.<br>
In addition, the common pilot channels may be used in addition<br>
to the dedicated pilot channels in order to improve the<br>
channel estimation accuracy when there is a higher channel<br>
correlation between the multi-beam transmission and the<br>
adaptive beam transmission. On the other hand, the reference<br>
level measurement for the cell-search or the handover and<br>
the CQI measurement for the scheduling, the adaptive link<br>
control, or the like are carried out principally using the<br>
common pilot channels transmitted by the sector beam and the<br>
multi-beam.<br>
FIG. 18 shows the pilot channels transmitted by the<br>
adaptive directional beam.<br>
(Pilot Channel Configuration)<br>
The common pilot channels and the dedicated pilot<br>
channels may be multiplexed periodically in every TTI.<br>
Depending on the user and the environment, the dedicated<br>
channels are used so as to improve the channel estimation<br>
accuracy. When one chunk is used exclusively by one or<br>
several user(s) regarding the shared data channels under<br>
situations of, for example, high mobility, a large delay<br>
spread, or an extremely low SINR, the dedicated pilot<br>
channels are allocated in addition to the common pilot<br>
channels, thereby enabling accurate channel estimation. In<br>
the multicast/broadcast channel, the dedicated pilot<br>
- 28 -<br><br>
channels are used in addition to the common pilot channels,<br>
thereby improving user quality of the user which has had the<br>
worst quality. Additional user-dependent dedicated pilot<br>
channel information in the shared data channels is provided<br>
by a control signaling channel. Therefore, by using more<br>
pilot symbols in lower delay conditions, high quality<br>
demodulation of the shared data channels can be realized.<br>
In the multicast/broadcast channel, additional<br>
environment-dependent dedicated pilot channel information<br>
is provided by the control signaling channel based on the<br>
user quality in the worst environment. By using more pilot<br>
symbols in lower delay conditions, a high quality<br>
multicast/broadcast channel is provided.<br>
The pilot channels may be mapped at higher density<br>
taking more account of the frequency domain rather than the<br>
time domain. More pilot channels may be allocated in the<br>
frequency domain rather than in the time domain. Namely, the<br>
pilot channel density may be higher in the frequency domain<br>
than in the time domain. Although channel fluctuations in<br>
the time domain might be less significant when the TTI length<br>
is relatively short, it is expected that the channel<br>
fluctuations in the frequency domain become significant due<br>
to time dispersiveness in the frequency selective multi-path<br>
fading. Therefore, it is more advantageous to densely map<br>
the pilot channels than to divide the pilot channels into<br>
sub-carriers for allocation according to a TDM method.<br>
TDM-based and/or FDM-based multiplexing may be<br>
employed by carrying out staggered mapping from the top of<br>
the TTI. In the staggered mapping, channels are mapped at<br>
predetermined intervals in one time slot, whereas the<br>
channels are mapped at the predetermined intervals in<br>
different frequencies in other time slots, as shown in FIG.<br>
16. The common pilot channels and the dedicated pilot<br>
- 29 -<br><br>
channels may be mapped in each TTI in accordance with the<br>
staggered mapping. The common pilot channels may be mapped<br>
highly preferentially before the dedicated channels. When<br>
the pilot channels are mapped at the top of each TTI, at least<br>
the following advantages are exerted. When the control<br>
signaling channels are mapped at the top of each TTI along<br>
with the common/dedicated pilot channels, the control<br>
signaling channels are reliably demodulated by accurate<br>
channel estimation even under a situation where channel<br>
quality fluctuation takes place due to various delay spreads<br>
and Doppler frequencies. When the control signaling<br>
channels are mapped at the top of each TTI and no traffic<br>
data are transmitted by a chunk (namely when only control<br>
signaling bits are transmitted) , it is advantageous that user<br>
equipment (UE) performs efficient cyclic reception.<br>
FIG. 19 shows an example of allocation of the common<br>
and the dedicated pilot channels.<br>
FIG. 20A shows simulation results obtained in<br>
accordance with an example of the present invention, in which<br>
a relationship between energy per symbol per noise power<br>
spectral density (Es/No) and throughput. Three kinds of<br>
plots in FIG. 20A correspond to simulation results obtained<br>
by three numbers (Nstg=0, 1, 2) of time slots to be subjected<br>
to the staggered mapping of the pilot symbols, respectively.<br>
Channel configurations corresponding to Nstg=0, 1, 2, are<br>
shown in FIG. 20B, respectively. A curve with open circles<br>
in FIG. 20A shows the relationship at Nstg=0; a curve with<br>
hatched circles shows the relationship at Nstg=1; and a curve<br>
with closed circles shows the relationship at Nstg=2. A<br>
moving velocity at which a mobile station moves is assumed<br>
to be 120 km/h in these simulations. In FIG. 20A, as the time<br>
slot number Nstg to be subjected to the pilot symbol mapping<br>
is increased, the throughput is further improved, which<br>
- 30 -<br><br>
indicates effectiveness of the staggered mapping. This is<br>
thought to be because of an improved traceability of the<br>
channel estimation in the time domain.<br>
In the mapping method of the common pilot channels and<br>
the dedicated pilot channels, the pilot symbols may be<br>
discontinuously allocated in the frequency domain and the<br>
time domain. For example, discontinuous mapping along the<br>
frequency domain of the OFDM symbols may be employed. When<br>
the pilot symbols are allocated in a discontinuously<br>
dispersive manner in the frequency domain and the time domain,<br>
the following advantage is exerted. First, since the<br>
sub-carriers that are allocated to the pilot symbols in the<br>
frequency domain are thinned, a reduction in data<br>
transmission efficiency, which is caused by inserting the<br>
pilot symbols, can be prevented while the channel estimation<br>
accuracy is kept comparable with the channel estimation<br>
accuracy realized when the sub-carriers are not thinned.<br>
Allocation amount in the time domain is reduced.<br>
Transmission power of the common pilot channels needs to be<br>
changed depending on a target cell radius in an actual<br>
cellular method. Therefore, the pilot symbols are thinned<br>
in the frequency domain, namely the pilot symbols and other<br>
channels are multiplexed and transmitted in the same OFDM<br>
symbols, thereby maintaining overall transmission power and<br>
flexibly changing the transmission power of the common pilot<br>
channels.<br><example><br>
In an example 7 of the present invention, there is<br>
described a method utilizing orthogonal code sequences in<br>
sectors of the same cell site. This method can be employed<br>
not only between plural sectors, which are included in a cell,<br>
but also between cells. In conventional W-CDMA, scrambling<br>
is performed using different spreading codes for different<br>
- 31 -<br><br>
sectors; a received signal is scrambled by the corresponding<br>
scramble codes so as to produce the pilot channels; and the<br>
channel estimation or the like is performed. Since the<br>
scramble codes which are different in each sector are<br>
determined at random, the pilot channels are interfered with<br>
due to inter-code interference from the symbols whose<br>
sub-carrier and sub-frame are the same in the sector<br>
(inter-sector interference). As a result, it becomes<br>
relatively difficult to perform highly accurate channel<br>
estimation and cell search, or it takes more time even if<br>
the channel estimation and the cell search can be performed.<br>
This results in a disadvantage especially when the mobile<br>
station requires a fast hand-over or moves frequently across<br>
sector boundaries. In regard to this point, it seems<br>
possible to improve signal quality to some extent under a<br>
multi-path transmission environment by employing the OFDM<br>
method in data channel downlink and eliminating the need for<br>
multiplying the data channels by the scramble code. However,<br>
since the pilot channels are multiplied by the scramble codes<br>
that are different for each sector in order to distinguish<br>
the sectors, reception qualities of the pilot channels are<br>
not substantively improved, which makes still difficult the<br>
highly accurate channel estimation or the like. The seventh<br>
example has been contemplated in view of such a disadvantage<br>
and directed to an improvement of reception qualities of the<br>
pilot channels in OFDM method downlink.<br>
According to this example, sector-specific orthogonal<br>
sequences are used in the pilot channels in addition to<br>
cell-specific orthogonal code sequences. With this, the<br>
pilot channels are prevented from being interfered from<br>
adjacent sectors in the same cell. Since such inter-sector<br>
interference is prevented, the channel estimation accuracy<br>
can be improved. Improvement of the channel estimation<br>
- 32 -<br><br>
accuracy is advantageous in concurrent transmissions related<br>
to a fast sector selection and soft-combining.<br>
FIG. 21A schematically shows use of a pilot sequence<br>
orthogonal between sectors (or beams) according to this<br>
example. A terminal that is to perform handover at a sector<br>
edge can perform the channel estimation concurrently based<br>
on the pilot signals from two base stations, thereby enabling<br>
high accuracy and high speed channel estimation. For example,<br>
a user #1 existing at an edge or end of a sector (namely,<br>
a user that is to perform the fast sector selection or the<br>
soft-combining) distinguishes the sectors by despreading the<br>
orthogonal sequences so as to enable accurate channel<br>
estimation. A user #2 that is not to perform the fast sector<br>
selection or soft-combining can use each pilot symbol (or,<br>
takes account of the cell-specific and/or the<br>
sector-specific orthogonal code) so as to perform the channel<br>
estimation.<br>
FIG. 21B shows a pilot channel generation portion used<br>
in a transmitter according to this example of the present<br>
invention. The transmitter is typically a radio base station.<br>
The pilot channel generation portion includes a pilot<br>
sequence portion 2102 that provides a pilot channel sequence,<br>
a scramble code portion 2104 that provides a scramble code,<br>
an orthogonal code portion 2106 that provides different<br>
spreading symbols (orthogonal codes) for different sectors,<br>
a multiplication portion 2108 that multiplies the scramble<br>
codes by the orthogonal codes, and a multiplication portion<br>
2110 that multiplies the pilot sequence by an output from<br>
the multiplication portion 2108 . The pilot sequence has been<br>
known by the radio base station and the mobile station. The<br>
scramble code is a random sequence to be commonly used by<br>
plural sectors. The orthogonal codes are determined for each<br>
sector so as to be orthogonal with one another.<br>
- 33 -<br><br>
FIG. 22 shows a specific example of the orthogonal codes<br>
multiplied on the pilot sequence. As shown, codes indicated<br>
by (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...) are mapped at intervals of<br>
one sub-carrier in a sector #1; codes indicated by (1, -1,<br>
1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...) are mapped at intervals of one<br>
sub-carrier in a sector #2; and codes indicated by (1, -1,<br>
-1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, ...) are mapped at intervals of one<br>
sub-carrier in a sector #3. These codes are orthogonal with<br>
one another.<br>
FIG. 23 shows another specific example of the<br>
orthogonal codes multiplied on the pilot sequence. As shown,<br>
codes indicated by (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...) are mapped<br>
at intervals of one sub-carrier in the sector #1; codes<br>
indicated by (1, e-j2/3n, e-j2/3n, 1, ej2/3n, e-j2/3n, 1, ej2/3n, . . . )<br>
are mapped at intervals of one sub-carrier in the sector #2;<br>
and codes indicated by (1, e-j2/3n, ej2/3n, 1, e-j2/3n, ej2/3n, 1,<br>
e-j2/3n,...) are mapped at intervals of one sub-carrier in the<br>
sector #3. Such codes can be orthogonal with one another.<br>
FIG. 24 shows a correspondence relationship between<br>
the scramble codes and the orthogonal codes. In the<br>
illustrated example, 40 sub-carriers are assumed in an<br>
available channel band and various types of data are<br>
associated with the corresponding sub-carriers so as to<br>
perform transmission according to the OFDM method. It goes<br>
without saying that the illustrated numerals are just<br>
examples. The channel band may be the entire band available<br>
to the system focused on, or one chunk. In the illustrated<br>
example, the scramble code is expressed by 40 data sequences<br>
and mapped to the corresponding sub-carriers . In the drawing,<br>
numerals 1 through 40 related to the scramble code express<br>
the codes that compose the scramble code. The scramble code<br>
in a second line in FIG. 1 is shifted by one individual code<br>
from the scramble code in a first line, since the scramble<br>
- 34 -<br><br>
code is transmitted so that the correspondence relationship<br>
is shifted by one individual code in the frequency axis<br>
direction, although the two scramble codes used are the same.<br>
With this, a signal in the frequency axis direction can be<br>
averaged out.<br>
In the specific example described in reference to FIG.<br>
22, the scramble codes are multiplied by the orthogonal codes<br>
of (1, 1, 1, 1, ...) and the resultant codes are multiplied<br>
by the pilot sequence in the sector #1; the scramble codes<br>
are multiplied by the orthogonal codes of (1, -1, -1, 1, . . . )<br>
and the resultant codes are multiplied by the pilot sequence<br>
in the sector #2; and the scramble codes are multiplied by<br>
the orthogonal codes of (1, 1, -1, -1, . . . ) and the resultant<br>
codes are multiplied by the pilot sequence in the sector #3.<br>
In the specific example described in reference to FIG. 23,<br>
the scramble codes are multiplied by the orthogonal codes<br>
of (1, 1, 1, 1, ...) and the resultant codes are multiplied<br>
by the pilot sequence in the sector #1; the scramble codes<br>
are multiplied by the orthogonal codes of (1, ej2/3n,<br>
e-j2/3n, . . . ) and the resultant codes are multiplied by the<br>
pilot sequence in the sector #2; and the scramble codes are<br>
multiplied by the orthogonal codes of (1, e-j2/3n, ej2/3n, . . .)<br>
and the resultant codes are multiplied by the pilot sequence<br>
in the sector #3.<br>
FIG. 25 shows an example in which the common pilot<br>
channels and other channels are multiplied by the scramble<br>
code and the orthogonal code. In FIG. 25, there are<br>
illustrated a providing portion 2502 that provides a sequence<br>
for the common pilot channels, a providing portion 2504 that<br>
provides a sequence for other channels, a scramble code<br>
portion 2506 that provides the scramble code, an orthogonal<br>
code portion 2508 that provides different sectors with<br>
different spreading code sequences (orthogonal codes), a<br>
- 35 -<br><br>
multiplication portion 2510 that multiplies the scramble<br>
code and the orthogonal code, another multiplication portion<br>
2512 that multiplies the data sequence for the other channels<br>
by an output from the multiplication portion 2510, a yet<br>
another multiplication portion 2514 that multiplies the<br>
pilot sequence by an output from the multiplication portion<br>
2512. As stated above, the scramble code is commonly<br>
determined for the plural cells, and the orthogonal codes<br>
are determined so as to be different (orthogonal) for<br>
different cells. In the illustrated example, the common<br>
pilot channels and other channels are multiplied by the same<br>
scramble code and the same orthogonal code.<br>
FIG. 26 shows another example in which the common pilot<br>
channels and other channels are multiplied by the scramble<br>
code and the orthogonal code. Like numerals are given to<br>
elements and components that have already been described in<br>
reference to FIG. 25 and repetitive explanations are omitted.<br>
In FIG. 26, there are additionally illustrated a second<br>
scramble code portion 2602 and a multiplication portion 2604<br>
that multiplies a second scramble code by the orthogonal code.<br>
The (first) scramble code portion 2506 outputs the (first)<br>
scramble code to be commonly used by the plural sectors. In<br>
accordance with a predetermined rule instructed by the first<br>
scramble code portion 2506, the second scramble code portion<br>
2602 outputs a second scramble code to the multiplication<br>
portion 2604. The output from the multiplication portion<br>
2604 is multiplied by the data sequence for other channels<br>
(excluding the common pilot channels). Therefore, other<br>
channels are multiplied by the second scramble code and the<br>
orthogonal code, whereas the common pilot channels are<br>
multiplied by the first scramble code and the orthogonal code.<br>
With this, the common pilot channels are distinguished from<br>
other channels by their spreading codes. In this example,<br>
- 36 -<br><br>
since the second scramble code may be derived from the first<br>
scramble code, the transmitter can easily search for any<br>
channel as far as the derivation rule is known.<br>
FIG. 27 shows a combination of the specific examples<br>
shown in FIGS. 25 and 26. Without being limited to the<br>
illustrated combination, any combination of channels may be<br>
employed as an example of the present invention. The<br>
illustrated combination is advantageous in that the shared<br>
data channels whose spreading factor may change can be easily<br>
distinguished from channels whose spreading factor is kept<br>
at a constant level.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned suppression of<br>
interference in the pilot channels, transmission power of<br>
the shared data channels may be adjusted.<br>
FIGS. 28 (A), (B) , (C) show signals received by a certain<br>
user. FIG. 28(A) shows a signal (desired signal) to be<br>
received by a certain user from a cell or a sector to which<br>
the user is connected. In the drawing, the pilot channel is<br>
illustrated higher than the data channel since the pilot<br>
channel is transmitted and received with higher electric<br>
power than the data channel. FIG. 28 (B) shows a signal<br>
(non-desired signal) that is not the desired signal for the<br>
user. The non-desired signal indicates a signal from a cell<br>
(or a sector) to which the user is not connected, and is an<br>
interference signal to the desired signal. In this example,<br>
the interference to the pilot channel is suppressed because<br>
different orthogonal codes are used for the pilot channels<br>
of the desired signal and the pilot channels of the<br>
non-desired signal. FIG. 28 (C) schematically shows that the<br>
transmission power for transmitting the data channel from<br>
the radio base station (transmission power for the<br>
non-desired signal) is reduced, or the transmission is halted,<br>
so that the interference between the desired signal and the<br>
- 37 -<br><br>
non-desired signal is reduced by adjusting transmission<br>
timing or downlink frequency bands between the radio base<br>
stations or the sectors. More specifically, the<br>
transmission power for the non-desired signal is limited to<br>
less than a predetermined value. With this, interference<br>
between data channels, which may be a concern in the example<br>
of FIG. 28(B), can be suppressed. Or, the user may perform<br>
soft-combining by concurrently transmitting identical data<br>
channels instead of reducing the transmission power for the<br>
non-desired signal (to zero, if necessary).<br><example><br>
In an eighth example, there is described an orthogonal<br>
pilot mapping for MIMO transmission. Orthogonal<br>
multiplexed pilot channels may be used in an antenna gain<br>
technique such as MIMO multiplexed transmission, MIMO<br>
diversity transmission, and adaptive array antenna<br>
transmission. Only as an example, the pilot channels are<br>
transmitted according to the MIMO transmission from all the<br>
antennas in the transmitter. This is because the pilot<br>
channels are required to measure a CQI value for all the signal<br>
transmissions . All overheads of the common pilot symbols are<br>
the same regardless of the number of transmission antennas,<br>
because corresponding areas in cell coverage for the data<br>
channels are assured by using the MIMO transmission. In the<br>
MIMO transmission, the channel estimation is improved by<br>
further using the dedicated pilot channels (in the case of<br>
four branch MIMO transmission, the number of the pilot<br>
symbols per antenna becomes one-fourth of the number of the<br>
pilot symbols in single antenna transmission). Adaptive<br>
partial pilot symbol mapping for the MIMO transmission may<br>
be employed, namely the pilot symbols from a sector beam<br>
transmission mode may be thinned in accordance with an<br>
application scenario such as the delay spread and the moving<br>
- 38 -<br><br>
velocity.<br>
FIG. 29 shows orthogonal sequences for the MIMO pilot<br>
channels between sectors in the case of a four antenna<br>
transmitter. The dedicated pilot channels are used to<br>
complement the channel estimation. In the drawing, #1, #2,<br>
#3, and #4 correspond to a first, a second, a third, and a<br>
fourth antenna.<br><example><br>
In Examples 7 and 8, the inter-cell or inter-sector<br>
interference for the pilot channels is suppressed by-<br>
multiplying the pilot channels by the orthogonal codes.<br>
While such orthogonal codes are preferably used from the<br>
viewpoint of further suppression of the interference, use<br>
of the orthogonal codes is not necessary from the viewpoint<br>
of distinguishing cells and/or sectors but non-orthogonal<br>
codes may be used. However, when the non-orthogonal code<br>
expressed by a general random sequence is used, quality<br>
degradation of the pilot channels caused by the inter-code<br>
interference described at the beginning of Example 7 may be<br>
a concern. On the other hand, there are some types of<br>
non-orthogonal codes that are less problematic in terms of<br>
the inter-code interference (correlation) compared with the<br>
non-orthogonal codes expressed by the random sequence. Such<br>
a high-correlativity code (for example, a code that allows<br>
the inter-code interference to be on average within one-tenth<br>
of the code length) may be used to distinguish the cells and/or<br>
the sectors. As an example of such a code, there is a CAZAC<br>
code, which is briefly described in the following.<br>
As shown in FIG. 30, it is assumed that a code length<br>
of one CAZAC code A is L. For simplicity of explanation, this<br>
code length L is assumed to correspond to a time period of<br>
L samples, although this assumption is not necessary to the<br>
present invention. A series of A samples (shown by hatching<br>
- 39 -<br><br>
in the drawing) including the end sample (L-th sample) of<br>
the CAZAC code A are shifted to the top of the CAZAC code<br>
A and thus another CAZAC code B is generated, as shown in<br>
the bottom of FIG. 30. In this case, the CAZAC codes A, B<br>
are orthogonal with each other regarding Δ=1 through L-l.<br>
Namely, a first CAZAC code is orthogonal with a second CAZAC<br>
code generated by cyclically shifting the first CAZAC code.<br>
Therefore, when one CAZAC code having a code length of L is<br>
prepared, a group of L codes that are orthogonal with one<br>
another can be theoretically prepares. In addition, one<br>
CAZAC code A is not orthogonal with another CAZAC code B that<br>
is not derived from the CAZAC code A. However, even in this<br>
case, the inter-code interference between these CAZAC codes<br>
A, B is not significant compared with the inter-code<br>
interference between different random sequences. Moreover,<br>
the inter-code interference between a code sequence composed<br>
of part of one CAZAC code A and a code sequence composed of<br>
another part of the CAZAC code A or B is less significant<br>
compared with the inter-code interference between different<br>
random sequences. For a detailed explanation about the CAZAC<br>
code, see "Polyphase codes with good periodic<br>
correlation properties", D. C. Chu, IEEE Trans. Inform.<br>
Theory, vol. IT-18, pp. 531-532, July 1972; and "On<br>
allocation of uplink sub-channels in EUTRA SC-FDMA",<br>
3GPP, R1-050822, Texas Instruments.<br><example><br>
In Examples 7, 8, and 9, the pilot channels of the<br>
desired signal and the non-desired signal are concurrently<br>
transmitted. In a tenth example, the pilot channels of the<br>
desired signal and the non-desired signal are transmitted<br>
from a radio base station either at different times or in<br>
different frequencies, or both, as shown in FIG. 31. With<br>
this, the inter-cell or the inter-sector interference<br>
- 40 -<br><br>
regarding the pilot channels can be suppressed. In addition,<br>
when transmitting the data channels of the desired signal<br>
is prohibited during which time the pilot channels of the<br>
non-desired signal are being transmitted, the interference<br>
between the desired signal and the non-desired signal can<br>
be further suppressed.<br>
While preferred examples according to the present<br>
invention have been described in the foregoing, the present<br>
invention is not limited to the described examples but may<br>
be modified or altered in various ways within the scope of<br>
the present invention. In addition, although the present<br>
invention has been described in individual examples for<br>
simplicity of explanation, the present invention is not<br>
necessarily practiced as each example but one or more of the<br>
examples may be combined.<br>

direction and the time direction, or a combination thereof,<br>
with respect to the common pilot channel and the shared<br>
control channel.<br>
16.	A transmission apparatus comprising:<br>
a generation portion that generates a common pilot<br>
channel to be used by plural mobile stations;<br>
a multiplexing portion that multiplexes two or more<br>
channels to be transmitted; and<br>
- 45 -<br><br>
a first multiplication portion that multiplies the<br>
common pilot channel by a spreading code sequence common to<br>
plural sectors and an orthogonal code sequence different in<br>
different sectors.<br>
17.	The transmission apparatus of claim 16, wherein the<br>
first multiplication portion multiplies other channels<br>
excluding the pilot channel by the spreading code sequence<br>
common to plural sectors and the orthogonal code sequence<br>
different in different sectors.<br>
18.	The transmission apparatus of claim 17, further<br>
comprising:<br>
a derivation portion that derives another spreading<br>
code sequence from the spreading code sequence common to the<br>
plural sectors in accordance with a predetermined rule; and<br>
a second multiplication portion that multiplies other<br>
channels excluding the pilot channel by the derived spreading<br>
code sequence.<br>
19.	The transmission apparatus of claim 18, wherein the<br>
first multiplication portion multiplies the common pilot<br>
channel and the shared control channel by the spreading code<br>
sequence common to the plural sectors and the orthogonal code<br>
sequence different in different sectors; and<br>
wherein the second multiplication portion multiplies<br>
the shared data channel by the derived spreading code<br>
sequence.<br>
- 46 -<br><br><br>
A disclosed transmission apparatus includes a multiplexing portion that multiplexes a common pilot channel, a shared control channel, and a shared data channel; a symbol generation portion that performs an inverse Fourier transformation on the multiplexed signal so as to generate<br>
a symbol; and a transmission portion that transmits the generated symbol. The multiplexing portion multiplexes the shared control channel including control information necessary for demodulation of the shared data channel<br>
including a payload and the common pilot channel to be used by plural users in a frequency direction, and the shared data<br>
channel in a time direction with respect to the common pilot channel and the shared control channel. Even when the number of symbols composing a transmission time interval (TTI) is<br>
reduced, transmission efficiency of channels excluding the common pilot channel can be maintained by reducing insertion<br>
intervals of the common pilot channel accordingly.<br></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></td>
