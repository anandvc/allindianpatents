				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A need exists for additional methods for preparing fused oxazinones. Such compounds  include intermediates for the preparation of crop protection agents, pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals.<br>
Fused oxazinones have been prepared by a variety of methods. For example, N-acylanthranilic acids have been treated with' acetic anhydride, anthranilic acids have been treated with carboxylic acid anhydrides, and anthranilic acids and carboxylic acids have been coupled, in the presence of various dehydrating agents (see G. M. Coppola, J. Heterocyclic Chemistry 1999, 36, 563â€”588). Fused oxazinones have also been prepared by treatment of ortho-ammo carboxylic acids with carboxylic acid chlorides in the presence of base (see e.g., Jakobsen et al, Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 2000, 8, 2803-2812 and Jakobsen et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 2000, 8, 2095-2103). Benzoxazinones have also been prepared by treatment of a carboxylic acid with a sulfonyl chloride and then treatment with an anthranilic acid (see D. V. Ramana and E. Kantharaj, Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 1993, 25, 588).<br>

(1)	contacting a carboxylic acid with a sulfonyl chloride in the presence of an<br>
optionally' substituted pyridine compound, the nominal mole ratio of sulfonyl chloride to<br>

(2)	contacting me mixture prepared in (1) with an ortho-amino aromatic carboxylic<br>
acid in the presence of an optionally substituted pyridine compound, the nominal mole ratio-<br>
of the ortho-ammo aromatic carboxylic acid to carboxylic acid charged in (1)- being from about 0.8 to 1.2; and<br>
(3)	adding additional sulfonyl chloride to the mixture prepared in (2), the nominal<br>

This method is characterized by preparing the compound of Formula la (i.e. a subgenus of Formula 1 described below) by the method as indicated above. Formula la compounds may be prepared using a compound of the formula LS(O)2C1 (wherein L is selected from alkyl, haloalkyl and phenyl optionally substituted with from one to three substituents independently selected from alkyl or halogen) as the sulfonyl chloride, a compound of Formula 2' as the carboxylic acid, and a compound of Formula 5' as the ortho-ammo aromatic carboxylic acid<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION One aspect of this mvention involves the use of optionally substituted pyridine compounds together with sulfonyl chloride compounds to provide advantageous production of fused oxazinones. The optionally substituted pyridine compound is used (a) to facilitate contact between the carboxylic acid and the sulfonyl chloride compound and (b) to facilitate contact of the resulting mixture with the ortho-amino carboxylic acid. The sulfonyl chloride compound is used both (a) as a reactant to facilitate coupling of the carboxylic acid with the ortho-amino carboxylic acid and (b) as a reactant to facilitate ring closure to form the fused oxazinone. These aspects provide effective production of the fused oxazinone while limiting the amounts of the carboxylic acid and the ortho-amino carboxylic acid that are consumed during the formation of the fused oxazinone. This can be especially important when the carboxylic acid and/or the ortho-amino carboxylic acid are valuable, complex and/or difficult to obtain. For example, this invention may be used for preparing a compound of Formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
wherein<br>
J is an optionally substituted carbon moiety; and<br>
K is, together with the two contiguous linking carbon atoms, a fused phenyl ring or a<br>
fused 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, each ring optionally substituted. More particularly, a compound of Formula 1 may be prepared by a method comprising<br>
(1)	contacting a carboxylic acid of Formula 2<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
with a sulfonyl chloride of Formula 4<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein L is selected from alkyl, haloalkyl, and phenyl optionally substituted with from one to three substituents independently selected from alkyl or halogen;<br>
in the presence of an optionally substituted pyridine compound;<br>
(2)	contacting the mixture prepared in (1) with an ortho-ammo carboxylic acid of Formula 5<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
in the presence of an optionally substituted pyridine compound; and<br>
(3)	contacting the mixture prepared in (2) with additional sulfonyl chloride of Formula 4.<br>
In the recitations herein, the term "carbon moiety" refers to a radical in which a carbon atom is connected to the backbone of the fused oxazinone ring of Formula 1 and the carboxylic acid group of Formula 2. As the carbon moiety L is separated from the reaction center, it can encompass a, great variety of carbon-based moieties that can be prepared by modern methods of synthetic organic chemistry. The method of this invention is generally applicable to prepare a wide range of compounds of Formula 1.<br>
"Carbon moiety" thus includes alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties, which can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
"Carbon moiety" also includes carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings, which can be saturated, partially saturated, or completely unsaturated. The carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings of a carbon moiety group can form polycyclic ring systems comprising multiple rings connected together. The term "carbocyclic ring" denotes a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring backbone are selected only from carbon. "Saturated carbocyclic" refers to a ring having a backbone consisting of carbon atoms linked to one another by single bonds; unless otherwise specified, the remaining carbon valences are occupied by hydrogen atoms.   The<br>
term "hetero" in connection with rings or ring systems refers to a ring or ring system in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and which can contain from one to four heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. When the carbon moiety consists of a heterocyclic ring or ring system, it is connected to the backbone of the fused oxazinone ring of Formula 1 and the carboxylic acid group of Formula 2 through any available carbon ring atom by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon atom. Heterocyclic rings or ring systems may also be connected to the carbon moiety through any available carbon or nitrogen atom by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen atom.<br>
Although there is no definite limit to the size of Formula 1 suitable for the process of the invention, typically Formula 1 comprises 9-100, more commonly 9-50, and most commonly 9-25 carbon atoms, and 3-25, more commonly 3-15, and most commonly 3-10 heteroatoms. Heteroatoms are atoms other than carbon or hydrogen and are commonly selected from halogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon. Three heteroatoms in Formula 1 are the nitrogen atom and the two oxygen atoms in the oxazinone moiety. When K is a fused heteroaromatic ring or when the carbon moiety comprises a heterocyclic ring, additional heteroatoms are contained therein. Substituents attached to the K ring or the carbon moiety may also contain additional heteroatoms.<br>
Unsaturated rings can be aromatic if Hiickel's rule is satisfied. "Aromatic" indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) Ï€ electrons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. The term "aromatic carbocyclic ring or ring system" includes fully aromatic carbocycles and carbocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (e.g., phenyl, naphthyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalenyl). The term "nonaromatic carbocyclic ring or ring system" denotes fully saturated carbocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated carbocycles where the Huckel rule is not satisfied by any of the rings in the ring system. The terms "heteroaromatic ring or ring system" and "aromatic fused heterobicyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Huckel rule is satisfied). The term "nonaromatic heterocyclic ring or ring system" denotes fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles where the Huckel rule is not satisfied by any of the rings in the ring system. The term "aryl" denotes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or ring system in which at least one ring is aromatic, and the aromatic ring provides the connection to the remainder of the molecule.<br>
The carbon moiety specified for J is optionally substituted. Also, the K ring moieties of Formulae 1 and 5 are optionally substituted. Furthermore, the pyridine compound employed in the method of the invention (hereafter Formula 3) is optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these groups refers to groups that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. Illustrative optional substituents include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, hydroxycarbonyl, formyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, alkynylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy, aryloxy, alkyltbio, alkenylthio, alkynylthio, cycloalkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfinyl, alkenylsulfinyl, alkynylsulfinyl, cycloalkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkenylsulfonyl, alkynylsulfonyl, cycloalkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, amino, alkylarnino, alkenylamino, alkynylamino, arylamino, arninocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylarninocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkenyloxycarbonylamino, alkynyloxycarbonylamino and aryloxy-carbonylamino, silyl moieties and siloxy moieties, each further optionally substituted; halogen; cyano; and nitro. The optional further substituents are independently selected from groups like those illustrated above for the substituents themselves to give additional substituent groups for J and K such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkoxy. As another example, alkylarnino can be further substituted with alkyl, giving dialkyiamino. The substituents can also be tied together by figuratively removing one or two hydrogen atoms from each of two substituents or a substituent and the supporting molecular structure and joining the radicals to produce cyclic and polycyclic structures fused or appended to the molecular structure supporting the substituents. For example, tying together adjacent hydroxy and methoxy groups attached to, for example, a phenyl ring gives a fused dioxolane structure containing the linking group -0-CH2-0-. Tying together a hydroxy group and the molecular structure to which it is attached can give cyclic ethers, including epoxides. Illustrative substituents also include oxygen, which when attached to carbon forms a carbonyl function or when attached to nitrogen forms an N-oxide.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles can form N-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form N-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form N-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of N-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and /n-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as /-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane These methods for the preparation of N-oxides have been  extensively  described  and reviewed  in  the  literature,   see   for   example:<br>

These carbon moieties may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) ranges from one to four. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with from one to four substituents is the ring illustrated as U-l in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused carbobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include a naphthyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-85 and a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-86 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include U-54 through U-84 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Other examples of J include a benzyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated  as U-87 and a benzoyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-88 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4.<br>
Although Rv groups are shown in the structures U-l through U-85, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. The nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with H or Rv. Note that some U groups can only be substituted with less than 4 Rv groups (e.g. U-14, U-15, U-l 8 through U-21 and U-32 through U-34 can only be substituted with one Rv). Note that when the attachment point between (Rv)r and the U group is illustrated as floating, (Rv)r can be attached to any available carbon atom or nitrogen atom of the U group. Note that when the attachment point on the U group is illustrated as floating, the U group can be attached to the remainder of Formula I through any available carbon of the U group by replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br>

As indicated above, the carbon moiety J may be (among others) saturated or partially saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings, which can be further optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these J groups refers to groups that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. These carbon moieties may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) ranges from one to four. Examples of saturated or partially saturated carbocyclic rings include optionally substituted C3-C8 cycloalkyl and optionally substituted C3-C6 cycloalkenyl. Examples of saturated or partially saturated heterocyclic rings include optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered nonaromatic heterocyclic rings optionally including one or two ring members selected from the group consisting of C(=O), SO or S(O)2-   Examples of such J groups include those<br>
illustrated as G-l through G-35 in Exhibit 2. Note that when the attachment point on these G groups is illustrated as floating, the G group can be attached to the remainder of Formula 1 through any available carbon or nitrogen of the G group by replacement of a hydrogen atom. The optional substituents can be attached to any available carbon or nitrogen by replacing a hydrogen atom (said substituents are not illustrated in Exhibit 2 since they are optional substituents). Note that when G comprises a ring selected from G-24 through G-31, G-34 and G-35, Q2 may be selected from O, S, NH or substituted N.<br>
Exhibit 2<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
It is noted that the J group may be optionally substituted. As noted above, a J group may commonly comprise a U group or a G group further substituted with from one to four substituents. Thus J groups may comprise a U group or a G group selected from U-l through U-88 or G-l through G-35, and further substituted with additional substituents including from one to four U or G groups (which may be the same or different) and both the core U or G group and substituent U or G groups optionally further substituted. Of note are J groups comprising a U or G group substituted with one U or G group and optionally substituted with from one to three additional substituents.

As noted above, K is, together with the two contiguous linking carbon atoms, a fused phenyl ring or a fused 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, each ring optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these K rings refers to K rings that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. An example of a K ring wherein the K ring is optionally substituted with from one to four Rt includes the ring system illustrated as K-38 (fused phenyl ring) in Exhibit 3 wherein n is an integer from 0 to 4 and Rt is any substituent. Example of said K rings wherein the K ring is optionally substituted with from one to three Rl include the ring systems K-l to K-37 (5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings) in Exhibit 3, wherein n is an integer from 0 to 3 and Rl is any substituent. As with the carbon atoms in the ring, the nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with hydrogen or with Rt. Although (Rt)n groups are shown in the structures K-l to K-38, it is noted that Rt does not need to be present since it is an optional substituent. Note that some K rings can only be substituted with less than 3 Rt groups (e.g. K-7 through K-10, K-15, K-16, K-20, K-21, K-23, K-24, K-26 and K-27 can only be substituted with one Rt). In the exemplified K groups, the upper right bond is attached through the available linking carbon atom to the nitrogen atom of the oxazinone portion of Formula 1 and the lower right bond is attached through the available<br>
linking carbon atom to the carbonyl atom of the oxazinone portion of Formula 1. The wavy line indicates that the K ring is attached to the remainder of Formula 1 as illustrated below.<br>

The reaction sequence (i.e. Steps (1), (2) and (3)) is typically conducted sequentially in the same reaction vessel and without isolation or purification of the products until the overall reaction sequence is complete. Normally, Steps (1), (2) and (3) are all conducted in a suitable solvent. Typically the same solvent is used throughout the reaction sequence. The<br>
solvent(s) should be inert under the conditions of the reaction steps. Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene or toluene, and preferred solvents include esters such as ethyl acetate or butyl acetate; ketones such as acetone, 2-butanone, or 4-methyl-2-pentanone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; nitriles such as acetonitnle; and halocarbons such as dichloromethane or chloroform. More preferred solvents include acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, acetone, THF and dichloromethane. Most preferred are acetonitrile and acetone. The overall reaction sequence is typically conducted at temperatures ranging from -30 Â°C to +50 Â°C. Preferred is the addition to the reaction vessel (charging) of all components at temperatures from -10 Â°C to +5 Â°C, with reaction periods of from 1 to 60 minutes (preferred are reaction periods of from 5 to 15 minutes) between additions. Except where noted otherwise, the components can be added as mixtures, followed by warming to from +20 Â°C to +30 Â°C for 0.5 to 24 hours (preferably 2 to 4 hours). Charging of a component (for example, a reactant, a solvent, etc.) means adding the component during the step. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a component may be added (i.e. charged) in various ways, for example as a batch, intermittent or continuous feed depending on process design. The manner in which a component is added and/or reacted can influence the actual mole ratio of that component to others over the duration of the step. However, the overall amount of a component added during a step is considered to be the amount charged, and is used herein for determining nominal mole ratios.<br>

The nominal mole ratio (i.e. the ratio of reactants charged during Step (1)) of the Formula 4 compound to the Formula 2 compound is typically from about 1.0 to 1.5, and preferably is from about 1.1 to 1.3. Preferred Formula 4 compounds include methanesulfonyl chloride, propanesulfonyl chloride and benzenesulfonyl chloride. Methanesulfonyl chloride is more preferred for reasons of lower cost and/or less waste. The nominal mole ratio of the Formula 3 compound charged in Step (1) to the Formula 2 compound charged in Step (1) is typically from about 1.0 to 2.0, and is preferably from about 1.4 to 1.7. Preferred Formula 3 compounds include 2-picoline, 3-picoline, 2,6-lutidine, and pyridine. The compounds of Formulae 2, 3 and 4 may be combined in any order except that compound 2 cannot be added to the reaction<br>
mixture last. A preferred order of addition is to add a mixture of Formula 2 and Formula 3 in a solvent to a solution of Formula 4 in the same solvent.<br>

Normally, a second portion of Formula 3 compound is charged during Step (2); and the nominal mole ratio of the second portion of Formula 3 compound charged in Step (2) to the Formula 2 compound charged in Step (1) is typically from about 2.0 to 4.0, and preferably is from about 2.9 to 3.5. The compounds of Formulae 5 and 3 can be added to the mixture prepared in Step (1) in either order or as a mixture in solvent.<br>
In Step (3) the mixture prepared in Step (2) is contacted with a sulfonyl chloride of Formula 4. Typically, the sulfonyl chloride in Step (3) is the same compound as that used in Step (1). The nominal mole ratio of the second portion of the Formula 4 compound charged in Step (3) to the Formula 2 compound charged in Step (1) is typically from about 1.0 to 1.5, and preferably is from about 1.1 to 1.3.

Esters of Formula 5 orthosxnino carboxylic acids (Formula 7) can be prepared from monoesters of ortho-dicarboxylic acids of Formula 6 via rearrangement of the corresponding acyl azide and hydrolysis of the resulting isocyanate (or alternatively by trapping of the isocyanate with an alcohol and cleaving of the resulting carbamate) as shown in Scheme 2.<br>

(Scheme Removed) Compounds of Formulae 6 and 8 are known in the art or can be readily prepared from compounds known in the art. (For example, see Tetrahedron 1997, 53, 14497; J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1996, 10, 1035; PCT Patent Publication WO 92/08724 and European Patent Application EP 418667).<br>
Carboxylic ester compounds of Formula 7 can be converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid compounds of Formula 5 by numerous methods including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). In many cases, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid of Formula 5. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
Anthranilic acids (or esters thereof) of Formula 5a (compounds of Formula 5 wherein K is a fused phenyl ring) are typically available from the corresponding 2-nitrobenzoic acids (or esters) of Formula 9 via catalytic hydrogenation of the nitro group (Scheme 4). Typical procedures involve reduction with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide in hydroxylic solvents such as ethanol and isopropanol. They can also be prepared by reduction with zinc in acetic acid. These methods for reducing nitro groups are well documented in the chemical literature.<br>

Benzoic acids of Formula 2 (wherein J is optionally substituted phenyl) are generally well known in the art, as are procedures for their preparation.<br>
Benzoic acids of Formula 2a may be prepared from the benzonitriles of Formula 10 by hydrolysis (Scheme 6). The conditions used may involve the use of a base such as an alkaline metal hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g., potassium or sodium hydroxide) in a solvent such as water, ethanol or ethylene glycol (see e.g., J. Chem. Soc. 1948, 1025). Alternatively, the hydrolysis may be carried out using an acid such as sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid in a suitable solvent such as water (see e.g., Org. Synth. 1955, Coll vol. 3, 557). The choice of the conditions is contingent on the stability of any optional substituents present on the<br>
aromatic ring to the reaction conditions and elevated temperatures are usually employed to achieve this transformation.<br>

Alkylation of pyrazoles using potassium carbonate and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are described by T. Kitazaki et al., Chem. PJiarm. Bull. 2000, 48(12), 1935-1946. One skilled in the art recognizes that a variety of bases and solvents can be used for alkylation of pyrazoles. For example, C. T. Alabaster et al., J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 575-583 discloses use of sodium carbonate in DMF, X. Wang et al., Org. Lett. 2000, 2(20), 3107-3109 discloses use of potassium tert-butoxide in methyl sulfoxide, and European Patent Application Publication EP-1081146-A1 describes the use of methyl sulfoxide and sodium or potassium hydroxide in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst or cesium carbonate. One skilled in the art also recognizes that a variety of alternative synthetic methods are applicable to the coupling of a pyrazole of Formula 22 to form a pyrazole of Formula 24 (or coupling of a pyrazole of Formula 25 below to form a pyrazole of Formula 26 below). These methods include, for example, condensation with aryl iodides in the presence of copper(I) iodide and trans-cyclohexanediamine as reported by A. Klapars, J. C. Antilla, X. Huang and S. L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc 2001, 123, 7727-7729, and condensation with aryl boronic acids in the presence of copper(II) acetate and pyridine as reported by P. Y. S. Lam, C. G. Clark, S. Saubem, J. Adams, M. P. Winters, D. M. T. Chan and A. Combs, Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39,2941-2944.<br>
Some pyrazole acids of Formula 2d may be prepared via metallation and carboxylation of pyrazoles of Formula 26 as the key step (Scheme 11). This reaction is typically conducted by treating compounds of Formula 25 with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) to form an anion and then contacting the anion with carbon dioxide.    The Ra group is<br>
introduced in a manner similar to that of Scheme 10, i.e. via alkylation with an Ra alkylating agent. Representative Rb groups include, for example, cyano and haloalkyl.<br>

This method is illustrated by Example 1, Steps D and E.<br>
Other pyrazoles of Formula 2d can be prepared via reaction of hydrazine of Formula 31 with a pyruvate of Formula 30 to yield pyrazole esters of Formula 32 (Scheme 13). Hydrolysis of the ester affords the pyrazole acids 2d. This procedure is particularly useful for the preparation of compounds wherein Ra is optionally substituted phenyl and Rb is haloalkyl.<br>
 Scheme 13 <br><br>
(Scheme Removed) Pyrazole acids of Formula 2d can also be prepared via 3+2 cycloaddition of an appropriately substituted nitrilimine of Formula 33 with either substituted propiolates of Formula 34 or acrylates of Formula 35 (Scheme 14). Cycloaddition with acrylates requires additional oxidation of the intermediate pyrazoline to the pyrazole. Hydrolysis of the ester of Formula 36 affords the pyrazole acids 2d. Preferred iminohalides for this reaction include the trifluoromethyl irninochloride (37) and the iminodibromide (38). Compounds such as 37 are known (J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1985, 22(2), 565-8). Compounds such as 38 are available by known methods (Tetrahedron Letters 1999, 40, 2605).

The starting pyrazoles of Formula 25 are known compounds or can be prepared according to known methods. The pyrazole of Formula 25a (the compound of Formula 25 wherein Rb is CF3) can be prepared by literature procedures (J. Fluorine Chem. 1991, 53(1), 61-70). The pyrazoles of Formula 25b (compounds of Formula 25 wherein Rb is CI or Br) can be prepared by literature procedures (Chem. Ber. 1966, 99(10), 3350-7). A useful alternative method for the preparation of a compound of Formula 25b is depicted in<br>

Metallation of the sulfamoyl pyrazole of Formula 39 with n-butyllithium followed by direct halogenation of the anion wim either hexachloroethane (for Rb being CI) or 1,2-dibromotetrachloroethane (for Rb being Br) affords the halogenated derivatives of Formula 40. Removal of the sulfamoyl group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature proceeds cleanly and in good yield to afford the pyrazoles of Formula 25c. One skilled in the art will recognize that Formula 25c is a tautomer of Formula 25b.<br>

Reaction of a compound of Formula 41 wherein R10 is C1-C4 alkyl with a suitable base in a suitable organic solvent affords the cyclized product of Formula 42 after neutralization with an acid such as acetic acid. The suitable base can be, for example but not limitation, sodium hydride, potassium t-butoxide, dimsyl sodium (CH3S(O)CH2e NaÂ®), alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) carbonates or hydroxides, tetraalkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or butyl)ammonium fluorides or hydroxides, or 2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-l,3-dimethyl-perhydro-l,3,2-diazaphosphonine. The suitable organic solvent can be, for example but not limitation,  acetone,  acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, or N,N-dimefhylformamide. The cyclization reaction is usually conducted in a temperature range from about 0 to 120 Â°C. The effects of solvent, base, temperature and addition time are all interdependent, and choice of reaction conditions is important to minimize the formation of byproducts. A preferred base is tetrabutyl-ammonium fluoride.<br>
Dehydration of the compound of Formula 42 to give the compound of Formula 43, followed by converting the carboxylic ester function to carboxylic acid, affords the compound of Formula 2f. The dehydration is effected by treatment with a catalytic amount of a suitable acid. This catalytic acid can be, for example but not limitation, sulfuric acid. The reaction is generally conducted using an organic solvent. As one skilled in the art will realize, dehydration reactions may be conducted in a wide variety of solvents in a temperature range generally between about 0 and 200 Â°C, more preferably between about 0 and 100 Â°C. For the dehydration in the method of Scheme 16, a solvent comprising acetic acid and temperatures of about 65 Â°C are preferred. Carboxylic ester compounds can be converted to carboxylic acid compounds by numerous methods including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224â€”269 for a review of methods). For the method of Scheme 16, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid of Formula 2f. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>

One skilled in the art will recognize that this reaction may require catalysis by an optional acid and may also require elevated temperatures depending on the molecular substitution pattern of the hydrazone of Formula 46. Reaction of the hydrazone of Formula 46 with the compound of Formula 47 in a suitable organic solvent such as, for example but not limitation, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of an acid scavenger such as triethylamine provides the compound of Formula 41. The reaction is usually conducted at a temperature between about 0 and 100 Â°C.

Oxidation of the compound of Formula 48 optionally in the. presence of acid to give the compound of Formula 49 followed by conversion of the carboxylic ester function to the carboxylic acid provides the compound of Formula 2g. The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, potassium monopersulfate (e.g., OxoneÂ®) or potassium permanganate. To obtain complete conversion, at least one equivalent of oxidizing agent versus the compound of Formula 48 should be used, preferably between about one to two equivalents. This oxidation is typically carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane and the like, an organic ester, such as ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and the like, or a polar aprotio organic such as N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and the like. Acids suitable for use in the oxidation step include inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzoic acid and the like. The acid, when used, should be used in greater than 0.1 equivalents versus the compound of Formula 48. To obtain complete conversion, one to<br>
five equivalents of acid can be used. The preferred oxidant is potassium persulfate, and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the presence of sulfuric acid. The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound of Formula 48 in the desired solvent and, if used, the acid. The oxidant can then be added at a convenient rate. The reaction temperature is typically varied from as low as about 0 Â°C up to the boiling point of the solvent in order to obtain a reasonable reaction time to complete the reaction, preferably less than 8 hours. The desired product, a compound of Formula 49, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation. Methods suitable for converting the ester of Formula 49 to the carboxylic acid of Formula 2g are already described for Scheme 16.<br>
Compounds of Formula 48 wherein R9 is halogen such as C1 or Br can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 50 as shown in Scheme 19.<br>
Scheme 19<br>
(Scheme Removed) wherein R10 is C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
Treatment of a compound of Formula 50 with a halogenating reagent, usually in the presence of a solvent, affords the corresponding halo compound of Formula 48 (R9 is halogen). Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphophoranes, dihalo'triphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene. Preferred are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula 50 should be used (i.e. the mole ratio of phosphorus oxyhalide to the compound of Formula 50 is 0.33), preferably between about 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 50 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents. Compounds of Formula 50 wherein R10 is C1-C4 alkyl are preferred for this reaction. Typical solvents for this halogenation include halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic<br>
solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimemylformarnide, and the like. Optionally, an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added. Addition of a catalyst, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, is also an option. Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is absent. Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used. The preferred process is conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 50 in acetonitrile. The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time, and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically between 20 Â°C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically less than 2 hours. The reaction mass is then neutralized with an inorganic base, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, or an organic base, such as sodium acetate. The desired product, a compound of Formula 48, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula 48 wherein R9 is halogen such as Br or Cl can be prepared by treating the corresponding compounds of Formula 48 wherein R9 is a different halogen (e.g., Cl for making Formula 48 wherein R9 is Br) or a sulfonate group such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate with hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively. By this method the R9 halogen or sulfonate substituent on the Formula 48 starting compound is replaced with Br or Cl from hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromomethane, dichloromethane, acetic acid, ethyl acetate or acetonitrile. The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel. The hydrogen halide starting material can be added in the form of a gas to the reaction mixture containing the Formula 48 starting compound and solvent. When R9 in the starting compound of Formula 48 is a halogen such as Cl, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means. Alternatively, the hydrogen halide starting material can be first dissolved in an inert solvent in which it is highly soluble (such as acetic acid) before contacting with the starting compound of Formula 48 either neat or in solution. Also when R9 in the starting compound of Formula 48 is a halogen such as Cl, substantially more than one equivalent of hydrogen halide starting material (e.g., 4 to 10 equivalents) is typically needed depending upon the level of conversion desired. One equivalent of hydrogen halide starting material can provide high conversion when R9 in the starting compound of Formula 48 is a sulfonate group, but when the starting compound of Formula 48 comprises at least one basic function (e.g., a nitrogen-containing heterocycle), more than one equivalent of hydrogen halide starting material is typically needed. The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 Â°C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 Â°C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 Â°C. Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst<br>
(such as aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula 48 wherein R9 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula 48 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula 48 wherein R9 is CI or Br can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 50 as already described. Starting compounds of Formula 48 wherein R9 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 50 by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride (e.g., methanesulfonyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride or^-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Pyrazolecarboxylic acids of Formula 2h wherein R9 is OCH2CF3 or Formula 2i wherein R9 is OCHF2 can be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme 20. In this method, instead of being halogenated as shown in Scheme 19, the compound of Formula 50 is oxidized to the compound of Formula 51. The reaction conditions for this oxidation are as already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 48 to the compound of Formula 49 in Scheme 18.<br>
The compound of Formula 51 is then alkylated to form the compound of Formula 54 (R9 is OCH2CF3) by contact with an alkylating agent CF3CH2Lg (52) in the presence of a base. In the alkylating agent 52, Lg is a nucleophilic reaction leaving group such as halogen (e.g., Br, I), OS(O)2CH3 (methanesulfonate), OS(O)2CF3, OS(O)2Ph-p-CH3 (p-toluene-sulfonate), and the like; methanesulfonate works well. The reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) carbonates and hydroxides, and organic bases, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, and polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like. Alcohols and polar aprotic solvents are preferred for use with inorganic bases. Potassium carbonate as base and acetonitrile as solvent are preferred. The reaction is typically conducted between about 0 and 150 Â°C, and more typically between ambient temperature and 100 Â°C.<br>

The compound of Formula 51 can also be alkylated to form the compound of Formula 55 (R9 is OCHF2) by contact with difiuorocarbene, prepared from CHCIF2 (53) in the presence of a base. The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, and polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like. The base can be selected from inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or sodium hydride. Preferably the reaction is conducted using potassium carbonate with N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent. The product of Formula 54 or 55 can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction. The esters can then be converted to the carboxylic acids of Formula 2h or 2i by the methods already described for the conversion of Formula 43 to Formula 2f in Scheme 16.<br>

In this method, a hydrazine compound of Formula 44 is contacted with a compound of Formula 56 (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a mixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt, such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, lithium tert-butoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 56 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 44 should be used, preferably between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 56 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 44 added over a period of time. Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent. Temperatures between about 30 and 90 Â°C are typically preferred. The addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows. Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours. Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 44 and Formula 56. After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature. Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times are 10 to 60 minutes. The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -C02R10 function on the compound of Formula 50 may be hydrolyzed to -CO2H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis. If the carboxylic acid (-CO2H) is formed, it can be converted back to -CO2R10 wherein R10 is C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well known in the art.   The desired product, a<br>
