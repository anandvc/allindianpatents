FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (-)-trans-4"(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine.	(-)-trans-4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-1-methylpiperidine prepared by the process of the invention has the formula-I,<br><br>
(-)-trans-4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine is a key intermediate used in the synthesis of paroxetine ((-)-trans-4-p"fluorophenyl-3-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyi)-piperidine) of the formula-II. Paroxetine is a serotonine reuptake inhibitor which has been used cHnically for the treatment of depression (S. M. Hassan, et al, Brit. J. Clin. Pharmacol., 1985, 19, 705; L. E. Dahl et al., Acta Osychiatr. Scand., 1982, 9, 66). US pat. No. 3,912,743 delineates some of paroxetine's pharmacological properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
For the first time, the (±)-compound of formula-I was disclosed in the US patent No 3,912,743. Subsequently it was also disclosed in the US patent no 4,007,196. Process disclosed in these patents is based on a Grignard reaction in which arecoline and 4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide are reacted.<br>
The main disadvantage of this process is that arecoline is very irritant and harmful to the persons involved in the usage and is also not commercially available. The process produces mixture of two stereoisomers in equal ratio. Therefore, it involves a resolution<br><br>
step and the unwanted isomer is of no use. Therefore, this process is not suitable for commercial preparation.<br>
Subsequently, a number of processes for the preparation of (±)-I were disclosed in various patents. Some of them include US Pat. No. 5,258,517; US Pat. No. 4,902,801; EP No. 374,675; EP No. 802,185; ES Patent No. 96 00,369; EP No. 812827; WO 98 53,824; EP No. 812,827; WO 00/026187 and WO 02/053537. Resolution of this mixture to get (-)-I leads to a loss of more than 50% of unwanted isomer which represents a severe disadvantage of the above processes.<br>
Keeping in view of the disadvantages of the process leading to formation of (±)-trans compound of formula-I a number of groups developed enantiospecific processes for the preparation of compound of the formula-L Some of the processes that gave more than 70% of the required isomer of formula-I are given below.<br>
In Tetrahedron Letters, 2001, 7805, a process for the preparation compound of the formula-I is disclosed starting from 2-piperidone derivative. Key step in this process is the introduction of 4-fluorophenyl group via 1,4-Michael addition to the compound of formula-VI in a stereospecific manner. Reduction of the compound of formula-VII gave the required compound of the formula-I.<br><br><br>
The main disadvantage of the process is that it involves handling of a chiral reagent (R* shown in scheme) which is not commercially available and very expensive. Also, the process produces the required (-)-I isomer in 80%. Purification of this isomer to &gt;99% requires a conventional resolution step which is not commercially attractive over the above mentioned process for the (±)-trans-L<br>
In the US patent No 6,066,737 a process for the preparation of compound of the formula-<br>
lis disclosed starting from pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde (Scheme-II). According to the<br>
i process pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde is converted to an aminal using a chiral compound<br>
1,2-diarylethylenediamine derivative. 1,4-Reduction of pyridine ring gave the compound<br>
of the formula-X as major isomer. Liberation of the protecting group and reduction of the<br>
dihydropyridine ring gave the required compound of the formula-I.<br><br>
Disadvantages of this process are that il requires a costly and rarely available chiral amine (N,N'-dimcthyl-2,3-diphenylethylcnediamine). Also, formation of pipcridine ring<br><br>
requires a hydrogenation step which would lead to the formation of a desfluoro impurity in the process. Removal of this impurity from required compound of formula-I is very difficult.<br>
Stereoselective synthesis of the compound of the formula-I is disclosed in US patent no 5,962,689 using a starting material of formula-XIII where R is chiral auxili£iry which controls the stereochemistry during 1,4-Michael addition of organometallic reagents (Scheme-Ill). Ratio of the required isomer formed in this process is only 80%. Remaining 20% of the unwanted isomer was removed by separation techniques such as column chromatography.<br><br>
Main drawback of this process is that the compound of formula-I is produced with 80% purity. Increasing the purity to required level needs a column chromatography which is not commercially viable.<br><br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above mentioned processes we aimed to develop a versatile method that could control the stereochemistry at C-3 and C-4 of compound of the formula-I in more than 95%.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Recently we developed a novel process (shown in Scheme-IV) for the preparation of (±)-trans compound of formula-I which is the subject matter of our Indian patent application bearing no 830/MAS/2002. According to the process disclosed in the said patent application the compound of the formula-XVI is reacted with an acrylate ester and converted the hydroxy group present in the compound of the formula-XVII to a leaving group and treated with a strong base to get the piperidine derivative of the formula-XIX, Reduction of the ester group present in compound of formula-XIX with a reducing agent gave the compound of formula-I.<br><br><br>
Piperidine ring formation in the above mentioned process is an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement reaction. If the stereochemistry of the leaving group OX in compound of formula-XVIII is fixed, the cyclized product of formula-XIX is also expected to be of stereospecific with opposite stereochemistry. Accordingly, to get the required compound of the formula-I (3S, 4R-isomer), starting compound of the formula-XVI should have the opposite stereochemistry, i. e., S-configuration at the asymmetric center of the compound of formula-XVIII.<br>
Accordingly, process for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I is as given below:<br><br>
The amine compound of the formula-XX can be resolved into a chiral amine of the formula-XXl and debenzylated under hydrogenation conditions to get the secondary amine of formula-XXII. The secondary amine of formula-XXll can be reacted with acrylic acid esters to give the corresponding N-alkylated derivative of the formula-XXIII.<br><br>
The hydroxy group present in the compound of the formula-XXIII can be converted to a leaving group OX (X = methanesulfonyl-, toluenesulfonyl-, benzenesulfonyl) to get a compound of the formula-XXIV.<br>
The compound of the formuIa-XXV can be prepared by the generation of an anion a to the ester carbon present in compound of the formula XXIV and intramolecular cyclization through displacement of the leaving group OX. The ester group present in compound of the formula-XXV can be reduced with a number of reagents like sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride to get the desired compound of the formula-I in more than 97% chiral purity.<br>
