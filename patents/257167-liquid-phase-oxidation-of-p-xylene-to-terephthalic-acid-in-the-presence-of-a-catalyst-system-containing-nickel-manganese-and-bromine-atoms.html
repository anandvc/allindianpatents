				<td>Liquid Phase Oxidation of P-xylene To Terephthalic Acid In The<br>
Presence of A Catalyst System Containing Nickel Manganese And<br>
Bromine Atoms<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention pertains to the liquid phase oxidation of p-xylene,<br>
more particularly to the liquid phase oxidation of p-xylene in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system containing nickel, manganese, and bromine atoms<br>
substantially free of zirconium atoms.<br>
2. Background of the Invention<br>
In typical known processes for producing terephthalic acid, p-xylene<br>
is oxidized to the product terephthalic acid. P-xylene is continuously or<br>
batchwise oxidized in a primary oxidation reactor in the liquid phase in the<br>
presence of an oxygen containing gas such as air. P-xylene, an oxidation<br>
catalyst, a molecular source of oxygen, and a solvent such as acetic acid<br>
are combined in a reactor to produce a crude terephthalic acid<br>
composition. A typical oxidation catalyst composition is made by<br>
contacting a cobalt compound with a manganese compound, usually also<br>
in combination with a promoter such as a bromine compound.<br>
The resulting terephthalic acid product is not very soluble in a<br>
solvent such as acetic acid under the reactor operating conditions, and<br>
usually crystallizes out of the solvent as a solid to form a suspension. The<br>
crude terephthalic acid composition in the primary oxidation reactor is a<br>
reaction mixture which contains terephthalic acid solids, a solvent acting<br>
as the suspending medium for the solids and containing a small amount of<br>
terephthalic acid dissolved therein, catalyst, unreacted p-xylene,<br>
incompletely oxidized intermediate oxidation products such as paratolualdehyde,<br>
para-toluic acid, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA), and other<br>
organic impurities which may cause discoloration dissolved in the solvent.<br>
The crude terephthalic acid composition is discharged from the oxidation<br>
zone and generally subjected to a variety of mother liquor exchange,<br>
separation, purification, and recovery methods, resulting in recycling back<br>
to the oxidation zone the recovered solvent and catalyst composition. It<br>
would be desirable to reduce the amount of incompletely oxidized<br>
intermediates ("intermediates"). By reducing the amount of intermediates,<br>
primarily composed of 4-CBA, one may either improve the yield, reduce<br>
the volume of mother liquor containing the intermediates which must be<br>
separated from the terephthalic acid product, reduce the amount of<br>
intermediates needed in a post oxidation reactor, or all the foregoing.<br>
Other by-products of the liquid phase oxidation which are partially<br>
or completely removed from the reaction mixture in the oxidation reactor<br>
are the off-gases which include water, solvent, unreacted oxygen and<br>
other unreacted gases found in the source of the molecular oxygen gas<br>
such as n itrogen a nd carbon d ioxide, a nd additional a mounts of c arbon<br>
dioxide and carbon monoxide produced by the catalytic decomposition of<br>
the solvent under the oxidation conditions. The off-gases are vented at<br>
the overhead of the oxidation reactor to a distillation column or a<br>
condenser to separate the solvent from the other off-gases such as water,<br>
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, methyl bromides, etc. The<br>
solvent recovered in the distillation column or condensers is recycled back<br>
to the oxidation reactor for further use. The hot uncondensed gases are<br>
removed from the distillation column and sent to energy recovery devices,<br>
such as turboexpanders and electric generators, or to heat exchangers, or<br>
to steam generators, optionally before or after passing through catalytic<br>
oxidation or other suitable equipment for neutralizing or removing acidic<br>
and corrosive ingredients in the gaseous stream.<br>
The oxidative decomposition of the solvent in the primary oxidation<br>
reactor resulting in the generation of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide<br>
gas is referred to as the solvent burn, and results in the loss of solvent. It<br>
is desirable to recover and recycle back to the oxidation reactor as much<br>
solvent as possible for further use. However, once the solvent is<br>
decomposed in the primary oxidation reactor into its constituent gaseous<br>
products, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide when acetic acid<br>
is the solvent, there no longer exists solvent to recover resulting in the<br>
permanent loss of solvent and requiring a fresh source of make-up<br>
solvent. R educing t he amount o f solvent b urn w ould s ignificantly I ower<br>
the operating costs in the oxidation zone by allowing a greater amount of<br>
solvent to be recovered and recycled back to the oxidation zone and by<br>
lowering the amount of fresh make-up feed. H owever, the reduction in<br>
solvent burn should not come at the expense increasing the amount of 4-<br>
CBA in the crude mixture, and if possible, it would be desirable to<br>
simultaneously reduce the solvent burn and reduce the amount of 4-CBA<br>
generated in the crude oxidation mixture.<br>
3. Summary of the Invention<br>
We have found that the decomposition of a solvent in an oxidation<br>
process and the production of 4-CBA can be controlled by a combination<br>
of an appropriate selection of reaction conditions and catalyst<br>
composition. There is now provided a process for the oxidation of pxylene<br>
to terephthalicacid comprising oxidizing in the liquid phase a pxylene<br>
composition comprising at least 80 wt.% p-xylene based on the<br>
weight of liquid reactants, at a temperature in the range of 120°C to 250°C<br>
and in the presence of a source of molecular oxygen and a catalyst<br>
composition substantially free of zirconium atoms comprising a source of<br>
nickel (Ni) atoms, a source of manganese (Mn) atoms, and a source of<br>
bromine (Br) atoms, to form a crude reaction mixture comprising<br>
terephthalic acid and incompletely oxidized reaction products comprising<br>
4-carboxybenzaldehyde compounds, wherein the stoichiometric molar<br>
ratio of bromine atoms to manganese atoms is 1.5 or less, and the amount<br>
of nickel atoms is at least 500 ppm.<br>
There is also provided a catalyst composition substantially free of<br>
zirconium atoms comprising a source of nickel atoms, a source of<br>
manganese atoms, and a source of bromine atoms, wherein the molar<br>
ratio of bromine atoms to each of nickel atoms and manganese atoms are<br>
1.5 or less, and the amount of nickel atoms are at least 500 ppm. The<br>
catalyst composition is also preferably substantially free of cobalt atoms.<br>
4. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a process flow of crude terephthalic acid<br>
streams and the overhead of an oxidation unit.<br>
5. Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
It is to be understood that the word comprising is open ended and<br>
may include any number and type of unstated steps, processes, or<br>
ingredients. The description of method steps does not preclude<br>
intervening steps and is not restricted to carrying out the steps in a<br>
particular order unless otherwise stated. Numerical ranges include each<br>
integer and all fractions thereof between the end points of the stated<br>
range.<br>
The process comprises oxidizing p-xylene in the liquid phase. The<br>
liquid phase may at any moment comprise the feed reactants, or the<br>
carboxylic acid reaction product dissolved or suspended in the reaction<br>
mixture, or both, especially in a continuous process.<br>
The product of the oxidation of p-xylene includes terephthalic acid<br>
solids as the predominant product (at least 50 wt.% of the solids), and<br>
incomplete oxidation products which may be found in the solids, in the<br>
liquid phase, or in both. P-xylene fed to the oxidation reactor may be<br>
purified of contaminants which may interfere with the oxidation reaction.<br>
The reactant feed may be pure or a mix of the compounds isomers or<br>
lower or higher homologues, as well as some saturated alicyclic or<br>
aliphatic compounds having similar boiling points to the aromatic or fused<br>
ring compounds. However, at least 80 wt.% , preferably at least 95 wt.%,<br>
or at least 98 wt.% of the liquid reactants is p-xylene.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the liquid phase oxidation<br>
process is carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are<br>
those which are solvents for the p-xylene under the oxidation reaction<br>
conditions, wherein the p-xylene is sufficiently soluble in the solvent so as<br>
to be completely soluble therein or sufficiently soluble to form a pumpable<br>
crude flow discharged from the oxidation reactor. Suitable solvents<br>
include water and the aliphatic solvents. The preferred aliphatic solvents<br>
are aliphatic carboxylic acids which include, but are not limited to,<br>
aqueous solutions of C2 to Ce monocarboxylic acids, e.g., acetic acid,<br>
propionic acid, n- butyric acid, isobutyric acid, n-valeric acid,<br>
trimethylacetic acid, caprioic acid, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the<br>
solvent is volatile under the oxidation reaction conditions to allow it to be<br>
taken as an off-gas from the oxidation reactor. It is also preferred that the<br>
solvent selected is also one in which the catalyst composition is soluble<br>
under the reaction conditions.<br>
The most common solvent used for the oxidation of p-xylene is an<br>
aqueous acetic acid solution, typically having a concentration of 80 to 99<br>
wt.%. In especially preferred embodiments, the solvent comprises a<br>
mixture of water and acetic acid which has a water content of about 2.5%<br>
to about 15% by weight. Additionally, a portion of the solvent feed to the<br>
primary oxidation reactor may be obtained from a recycle stream obtained<br>
by displacing about 80 to 90% of the mother liquor taken from the crude<br>
reaction mixture stream discharged from the primary oxidation reactor with<br>
fresh, wet acetic acid containing about 2.5to 15% water. This exchange<br>
may be accomplished in any convenient apparatus but can most easily be<br>
accomplished in a centrifuging apparatus, such as one or more cyclones.<br>
The amount of solvent used in not limited. It is not generally<br>
necessary to use large amounts. Suitable amounts of solvent range from<br>
0.1 wt.% to 20 wt.%, or 1 wt.% to 10 wt.%, or even small amounts in the<br>
range of 1 wt.% to 5 wt.%, based on the weight of all feeds to the<br>
oxidation reaction zone.<br>
The oxidation of p-xylene is conducted in the presence of a source<br>
of oxygen. This is easily accomplished be feeding an oxygen containing<br>
gas to the primary oxidation reactor to allow the gas to contact the liquid<br>
reaction mixture in the reactor. Preferred oxygen containing gases include<br>
air and other mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. One such convenient<br>
mixture which can be used in the process of the present invention is the<br>
vent gas from the primary oxidation which ordinarily comprises about 5 to<br>
20% oxygen. By reducing the amount of oxygen in the gas to a level less<br>
than found in air, the extent of solvent burn can be further reduced in the<br>
primary oxidation zone and also in secondary post oxidation reactors<br>
further downstream designed to complete the oxidation of intermediate<br>
products produced in the primary oxidation reactor.<br>
The relation between the temperature and pressure in the primary<br>
oxidation reactor is regulated to ensure that the reaction proceeds<br>
essentially in the liquid phase rather than completely in the gaseous<br>
phase, while allowing the reaction to proceed towards the oxidation of the<br>
reactants. The p-xylene feed should not be mostly vaporized. Thus, the<br>
oxidation reaction proceeds at elevated temperatures and pressures. It is<br>
desirable to ensure that at least 70% of the reactants remain in the liquid<br>
phase, more preferably at least 80%. The oxidation reaction desirably<br>
proceeds at a temperature ranging from 80°C to 250°C, and the heat of<br>
reaction will generate pressures ranging from 70 psig to 800 psig. For<br>
example, as p-xylene is oxidized to produce TPA using the catalyst<br>
composition of the invention in a liquid phase oxidation carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from 120-200°C and a pressure in the range of about<br>
90 to 270 psig. Lowering the oxidation temperature also helps to reduce<br>
the extent of solvent burn, all other conditions and ingredients being equal.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly well suited for oxidizing pxylene<br>
at low t emperatures without generating excessive amounts of 4-<br>
CBA. Thus, more preferred oxidation temperatures are within the range of<br>
140°C to 190°C.<br>
The catalyst system employed in the process of the invention is<br>
substantially free of zirconium atoms and comprises a source of nickel<br>
atoms, a source of manganese atoms, and a source of bromine atoms.<br>
The catalyst composition is preferably soluble in the solvent under<br>
reaction conditions, or it is soluble in the reactants fed to the oxidation<br>
zone. More preferably, the catalyst composition is soluble in the solvent at<br>
40°C and 1 atm., and is soluble in the solvent under the reaction<br>
conditions.<br>
The source of nickel may be provided in ionic form as inorganic<br>
nickel salts, such as nickel nitrate, nickel chloride, or organic nickel<br>
compounds such as nickel salts of aliphatic or aromatic acids having 2-22<br>
carbon atoms, including nickel acetate, nickel octanoate, nickel benzoate,<br>
and nickel naphthalate. The weight amount of each of nickel, manganese,<br>
bromine, or other atoms are based on the atomic weight of the atom,<br>
whether or not the atom is in elemental form or in ionic form. The weight<br>
percentage of a catalyst component includes the counter-cation or anion<br>
only if the weight percentage is used in the context of the source of the<br>
atom. For example, the amount of nickel refers to the amount of nickel<br>
atoms, whether elemental or ionic, and not the amount of nickel acetate.<br>
The stated concentration of catalyst components are based on the<br>
quantity of catalyst components in the reaction zone of the oxidation<br>
reactor. The catalyst component concentrations can be measured by<br>
sampling the oxidation reactor underflow.<br>
Nickel in the catalyst composition may be present in a<br>
concentration of about 500 to 5000 ppm, based on the weight of all liquid<br>
and solid feeds. Preferably, the concentration of nickel is about 500 to<br>
4000 ppm. Even more preferably, the concentration of nickel is about<br>
1500 to 3000 ppm. The oxidation state of nickel when added as a<br>
compound to the reaction mixture is not limited, and includes +2 or +3.<br>
The source of manganese may be provided as inorganic<br>
manganese salts, such as manganese borates, manganese halides,<br>
manganese nitrates, or organometallic manganese compounds such as<br>
the manganese salts of lower aliphatic carboxylic acids, including<br>
manganese acetate, and manganese salts of beta-diketonates, including<br>
manganese acetylacetonate. Manganese in the catalyst composition may<br>
be present in a concentration of about 100 to 3000 ppm. Preferably, the<br>
concentration of manganese is about 200 to 2500 ppm.<br>
The bromine component may be added as elemental bromine, in<br>
combined form or as an anion. Suitable sources of bromine include<br>
hydrobromic acid, sodium bromide, ammonium bromide, potassium<br>
bromide, tetrabromoethane, benzyl bromide, 4- bromopyridine, alphabromo-<br>
p-toluic acid, and bromoacetic acid. Hydrogen bromide and alphabromo-<br>
p-toluic acid are preferred bromine sources. Bromine in the<br>
catalyst composition may be present in an amount ranging from 150 to<br>
3000 ppm, based on the total liquid.<br>
The catalyst composition of the invention is substantially free of<br>
zirconium, and preferably also substantially free from cobalt. In one<br>
embodiment, the catalyst composition is free of any metals other than<br>
nickel and manganese. We have found that zirconium added to the<br>
catalyst composition impairs the reduction of solvent burn. For example,<br>
the solvent burn in an oxidation reaction is much higher using a catalyst<br>
composition containing Mn, Ni, Zr, and Br compared to the solvent burn<br>
observed when only Mn, Ni, Br are used the catalyst composition. Thus,<br>
the catalyst composition is devoid of Zr in a quantity which would increase<br>
the solvent burn by more than 10% relative to the same catalyst<br>
composition devoid of Zr. In one embodiment, the catalyst composition<br>
contains less than 5 ppm Zr, or 2 ppm or less of Zr, or 0 ppm Zr.<br>
Likewise, in another embodiment, the catalyst composition further<br>
contains less than 5 ppm cobalt, or 2 ppm or less of cobalt, or 0 ppm<br>
cobalt.<br>
The relative amounts of elements in the catalyst composition are<br>
not particularly limited, other than molar amount of bromine relative to<br>
manganese atoms is 1.5 or less. Normalizing the molar quantity of<br>
manganese to 1, the molar amount of bromine is 1.5 or less, preferably<br>
1 .1 or less, or 1 .0 or less, and even 0.9 or less.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the molar amount of bromine relative to<br>
each of nickel and manganese is 1.5 or less, or 1.1 or less, or 1.0 or less,<br>
or 0.9 or less.. The molar amount of bromine is desirably at least 0.3, or<br>
0.5 relative to the molar amount of each of nickel and manganese in order<br>
to maximize the yield of the desired acid.<br>
Suitable molar stoichiometric ratios of the nickel atoms to<br>
manganese atoms range from 0.2:1 to 4:1, preferably about 0.5:1 to 2.5:1.<br>
Non-limiting examples of catalyst component molar ratios suitable<br>
for use in the invention include the following: molar stoichiometric ratios of<br>
nickel atoms to bromine atoms ranging from about 0.66:1 to 5:1, or about<br>
0.9:1 to 4:1, or about 1.0:1 to 3.5:1, or about 1 .1:1 to 3.5:1; and molar<br>
stoichiometric ratio of manganese atoms to bromine atoms ranging from<br>
about 0.67:1 to 5:1, or 0.9:1 to 2.5:1, or about 1.0:1 to 2:1, or about 1.1:1<br>
to 1.8:1. Other suitable ranges include, by way of example, molar<br>
stoichiometric ratios of the following metals: Nii.2.5Mni-2Bro.3-i.5 or Nh-<br>
The particular amount of nickel used in the catalyst composition is<br>
at least 500 ppm Ni to be effective to maximize the yield of the desired<br>
acid. Below this amount, the yield to the desired acid suffers significantly.<br>
The total amount of catalyst present in the primary oxidation<br>
reactor, based on the ppm by weight of Ni, Mn, and Br atoms, and any<br>
other added metal atoms relative to the weight of the solvent is effective<br>
to obtain the desired degree of .conversion at the operation temperature.<br>
In general, suitable amounts of catalyst range from 2000 ppm to 9000<br>
ppm of total combined metal and bromine atoms, although more can be<br>
used if desired, especially if the oxidation reaction is conducted at lower<br>
temperatures. Suitable amounts of catalyst based on their compound<br>
weight will vary widely depending on the counter ion molecular weight, but<br>
for most common anions, the amounts would generally range from 0.1 to<br>
10 wt%, or 0.1 to 5 wt.%, or 0.1 to 3 wt.%, based on the weight of the<br>
solvent.<br>
Other organic or non-metallic catalyst components can be included<br>
in the catalyst composition of the invention. For example, the catalyst<br>
composition may include a source pyridine. The pyridine component of the<br>
catalyst s ystem m ay b e a dded t o a p rimary oxidation r eactor o r t o p ost<br>
oxidation reactors. The pyridine component can be in the form of pyridine<br>
per se or the form of a compound of pyridine. For example, 4-<br>
bromopyridine may be used as both a source of pyridine and bromine<br>
atoms.<br>
The catalyst composition can be formed by adding each source of<br>
metal and bromine atoms of the catalyst composition to the oxidation<br>
reactor separately in sequence or simultaneously, or a prepared<br>
composition may be added to the oxidation reactor, and in either case, the<br>
addition may be made as an initial batch or continuously during the course<br>
of the oxidation reaction. The catalyst composition prepared as a batch<br>
may be dissolved in the solvent to form a catalyst feed followed by adding<br>
the catalyst feed to the primary oxidation reactor. Each component, or the<br>
catalyst composition batch, can be added to the primary oxidation reactor<br>
before or after or during addition of the solvent. In a continuous process,<br>
the catalyst components or the catalyst composition are added<br>
simultaneous with the solvent feed, or in the solvent feed, or separately<br>
metered as required for fresh make-up.<br>
After the initial charge of catalyst composition in a continuous<br>
process, the residual mother liquor from the primary oxidation supplies a<br>
portion of the necessary catalyst components to the primary oxidation<br>
reactor by partial displacement of the primary oxidation mother liquor with<br>
fresh solvent. The remainder can be made up with a continuous fresh feed<br>
of make-up catalyst.<br>
By using the catalyst composition of the invention, the extent of<br>
solvent burned and rendered unusable in a recycle stream is reduced<br>
relative to other catalyst compositions containing zirconium, or other<br>
catalyst compositions containing the same metal atoms with molar<br>
quantities of bromine in excess of 1.5 with respect to manganese, under<br>
identical operating conditions. While the absolute amount of solvent burn<br>
in the present invention is quite low, this reduction is not achieved at the<br>
expense of yield. Obtaining a low amount of solvent is possible by<br>
running the reaction at low oxidation temperatures or using a catalyst<br>
which has a lower degree of conversion or selectivity, but this negatively<br>
impacts other results such as lowered yields and increased quantities of<br>
intermediates. The catalyst composition of the invention has the<br>
advantage of a m aintaining a low ratio of solvent burn to yield, thereby<br>
minimizing the impact on yield to obtain the low solvent burn relative to<br>
other catalyst compositions while simultaneously generating low quantities<br>
of incomplete intermediate oxidations products.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of solvent burn (in moles of<br>
CO and CO2 expressed as COx, per mole of terephthalic acid produced) is<br>
0.80 moles COx/mol TPA or less, or 0.70 or less, or 0.55 or less.<br>
The catalyst composition of the invention is also capable of<br>
reducing the quantity of incomplete intermediate oxidation products<br>
produced in the reaction mixture. In the process of the invention, the<br>
quantity of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) isolated intermediates in<br>
the reaction mixture is preferably below 60,000 ppm, more preferably<br>
below 50,000, or below 40,000, or below 30,000. The levels of 4-CBA<br>
listed are measured as the cumulative amount of 4-CBA in the solid and<br>
liquid phase and reported relative to the total weight of solid isolated. In<br>
the solid phase alone, the amount of 4-CBA produced by the process of<br>
the invention may be 10,000 or less.<br>
A preferred process in accordance with the present invention<br>
comprises contacting crude terephthalic acid which is produced by the<br>
oxidation of para-xylene with a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen comprising<br>
about 5 to 20% oxygen at a temperature of about 120°C to 190°C. and a<br>
pressure of 100 psig to 400 psig. The purification is conducted in the<br>
presence of a solvent which is preferably obtained by displacing about 80<br>
to 90% of the mother liquor from the primary oxidation with fresh, wet,<br>
acetic acid containing about 4-12% water. The residual mother liquor from<br>
the p rimary oxidation supplies m ost, if n ot a II, of the n ecessary catalyst<br>
components.<br>
The invention will b e further illustrated by the following examples<br>
although it will be understood that these examples are included merely for<br>
purposes of illustrating some of the embodiments within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to the accompanying FIG. 1, p-xylene is introduced v ia<br>
conduit 10 into primary oxidation reactor 12, and aqueous acetic acid<br>
solvent having 4-12% water having dissolved therein the catalyst<br>
composition of the invention is fed through line 11 to the reactor 12. If<br>
desired, the p-xylene, solvent, and catalyst composition charges may be<br>
fed to reactor 12 at a plurality of points along the side of the reactor, or fed<br>
together through one line. An oxygen-containing gas under pressure is<br>
introduced near the bottom of the reactor 12 via conduit 14. The preferred<br>
oxygen-containing gas is air or oxygen-enriched air. The flow rate of the<br>
oxygen-containing gas to reactor 12 is controlled to maintain between<br>
about 2 and 9 volume percent oxygen (calculated on a dry, solvent free<br>
basis) in the off-gas which exits the reactor via conduit 16. The reactants<br>
in reactor 12 are maintained at an elevated pressure of about 50 to 175<br>
psia to maintain a contained, volatizable reaction medium substantially in<br>
the liquid state at the reaction temperature of about 120 to 190°C.<br>
During the course of the oxidation reaction, exothermic heat of<br>
reaction and water generated by t he o xidation of p -xylene are removed<br>
from reactor 12 by vaporization of a portion of the liquid reaction medium.<br>
These vapors, known as reactor off-gas, comprise vaporized acetic acid<br>
solvent, about 5 to 30 weight percent water, and oxygen-depleted process<br>
gas containing minor amounts of decomposition products including<br>
catalyst residue, as well as additional carbon dioxide and carbon<br>
monoxide generated by the decomposition of acetic acid. The reactor offgas<br>
passes upwardly through the reactor 12 and is conveyed via conduit<br>
16 to the lower portion of water removal column 18 for distillation and<br>
recovery of the acetic acid back to the primary oxidation reactor. The<br>
crude reaction mixture is discharged from the primary oxidation reactor to<br>
a solid/liquid separator 20 into which is fed fresh acetic acid through line<br>
22 to exchange the mother liquor discharged through line 24. The mother<br>
liquor containing acetic acid and the catalyst composition is subjected to<br>
conventional purification and purging techniques to recover and recycle<br>
the catalyst composition to the primary oxidation reactor 12.<br>
The catalyst composition is effective as a catalyst not only in the<br>
primary oxidation zone, but also to effectuate post oxidation in secondary<br>
reactors to further increase the yield of product.<br>
Examples 1-7<br>
The following procedure was used as a representative procedure<br>
for examples 1-7, with variations noted on the table.<br>
Each of the catalyst solutions set forth in the Table, containing 80 g<br>
of a 96% aqueous acetic acid (92% aqueous acetic acid in examples 7)<br>
and the noted concentrations of nickel (as Ni(OAc)2  4 H2O), manganese<br>
(as Mn(OAc)2  4 HaO) and bromine (as HBr), were charged to a 300-mL<br>
titanium autoclave equipped with a high pressure condenser and an Isco<br>
pump. Once the autoclave was pressurize up to 100 psig with nitrogen,<br>
the contents were heated to about 160'C, or 163°C in the case of<br>
examples 7, in a closed system (i.e., with no gas flow). Thereafter, the<br>
pressure was increased b y an a dditional 2 40 p si-250 psi using a 50/50<br>
vol% mix of nitrogen and air at a flow rate of about 500 seem each. Once<br>
the autoclave was pressurized to about 340 to 350 psig, the pressure was<br>
further increased up to 700 psig using only nitrogen.<br>
At the target pressure, a flow of nitrogen at about 500 seem and air<br>
at about 500 seem was started and continued to maintain the target<br>
pressure throughout the experiment. Once the flow of nitrogen/air at the<br>
target pressure was commenced, p-xylene was pumped into the autoclave<br>
at a rate of 0.034 mL/min for 136 min. The reaction conditions noted on<br>
Table 1 were maintained throughout the experiment. Off-gas samples<br>
were taken at 90 min after starting the pumping of p-xylene.<br>
Concentrations of CO and COa were determined by GC. At the expiration<br>
of 136 minutes, the autoclave was cooled under a flow of nitrogen and<br>
vent. The reaction mixture was analyzed for the concentration of 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde, as determined by high pressure liquid phase<br>
chromatography, observed in the solids isolated and in the filtrate. The<br>
results are reported in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) The stoichiometric molar ratio of nickel, manganese and bromine in<br>
Examples 1 was 2.3:1.0:0.6 molar (or 1.0:0.4:0.3 molar normalized to<br>
nickel), in Examples 4 was 0.9:1.0:0.7 molar (or 1.0:1.1:0.8 molar<br>
normalized to nickel), and in Example 6 was 0.3:1.0:0.7 molar (or 1:3.3:2.3<br>
normalized to nickel).<br>
Examples 1a-1e, 4a-c and 6, which all use a catalyst system<br>
consisting of nickel, manganese and bromine, show a marked reduction in<br>
solvent burn as seen by the reduced amount of CO and CO2 produced in<br>
the course of the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid, relative to a<br>
reaction performed under comparable conditions with a catalyst system<br>
consisting of cobalt, manganese and bromine used as a benchmark<br>
(Comparative examples 7a-7c). The amount of CO and CO2 released in<br>
p-xylene oxidation is proportional to the extent of solvent loss through<br>
oxidative means.<br>
Comparative Example 2 shows that terephthalic acid is not<br>
produced, under the conditions evaluated (temperature and pressure), in<br>
the absence of manganese.<br>
Comparative Examples 3a-3b and 5 show that the addition of<br>
zirconium as a fourth catalyst component, even when added to a Ni/Mn/Br<br>
based catalyst system with a Br:Mn ratio of less than 1.5, leads to an<br>
increase in the amount of CO and CO2 produced, relative to that observed<br>
in the absence of Zr (Ex. 1a-1e and 4a-4c and 6).<br>
Examples 8-16<br>
Examples 8-16 illustrate the effect of stoichiometric molar ratios of<br>
the elements nickel, manganese, and bromine on solvent burn and<br>
intermediate production, in particular 4-CBA.<br>
Data for Examples Comp 8, Comp 9, 10, Comp 11, Comp 12, and<br>
13 are predicted values obtained from models derived from experiments<br>
performed in the same manner as in examples 1-7 using 96% aqueous<br>
acetic acid. Results for Examples Comp 14, Comp 15 and 16 are values<br>
obtained by an average of 3-4 data points generated in the same manner<br>
as in Examples 1 through 7, except that these examples were prepared<br>
using 88 wt.% aqueous acetic acid.<br>
(Table Removed)In each of the comparative examples, the molar stoichiometric ratio<br>
of bromine to nickel or of bromine to manganese was higher than 1.05.<br>
Example 10 achieved a simultaneous reduction in solvent bum and 4-CBA<br>
content relative to Comparative Examples 8 and 9 having a<br>
bromine:manganese ratio higher than 1.5, under the same temperature of<br>
157°C.<br>
Example 13 also achieved a simultaneous reduction in solvent burn<br>
per gram of solid isolated and 4-CBA content relative to Comparative<br>
examples 11 and 12 at slightly lower reaction temperatures of 155°C.<br>
Likewise, Example 16 achieved a simultaneous reduction in solvent<br>
burn per gram of solid isolated and 4-CBA content, and a lower absolute<br>
amount of solvent burn, relative to Comparative examples 14 and 15, both<br>
of which had a bromine:manganese ratio higher than 1.5, under a more<br>
dilute concentration of acetic acid and at a higher oxidation temperature of<br>
170°C.<br>
A comparison of the relatively small variation in solvent burn results<br>
between Examples 10,13, and 16 indicates that the catalyst composition<br>
of the invention allows for wide latitude of nickel concentrations.<br><br><br><br>
