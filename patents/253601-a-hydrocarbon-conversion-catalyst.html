3.  PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION: The following Specification 25    particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
A Hydrocarbon Conversion Catalyst<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst containing zeolite. More specifically, the present invention concerns a zeolite-containing cracking catalyst capable of 5    catalytically cracking hydrocarbons to produce C2-C4 olefins.<br>
Background art<br>
Light olefins (C2-C4 olefins) are important feedstocks for petrochemical industry. Generally, light olefins are prepared from petroleum hydrocarbons by a steam thermal cracking method<br>
10    in which gaseous hydrocarbons, naphtha, kerosene, light diesel oil and vacuum residue are used as feedstocks.  When the  conventional catalytic cracking process is used for the production of gasoline and light diesel, light olefins are also produced as by-products in a yield of less than 15 wt% of the feedstocks. The catalytic cracking process for obtaining light olefins from petroleum hydrocarbons have<br>
15 been reported in many patents. The metal-supported catalysts are used, wherein the carrier are S1O2, Af203, or other oxides, and the metaf components are mainly selected from elements of Groups IIB, VB, VI1B, and VIII, which show a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation activity, exhibits a dehydrogenation activity in cracking conditions of high temperature and low pressure, and thus accelerates the production of light olefins (US 3541179, US 3647682,<br>
20    DD 225135 and SU 1214726). When these catalysts are iJsed, owing to the dehydrogenation property of the supported metals, the coke formation due to the polymerization reaction is accordingly accelerated during the cracking reaction, and increased coke is formed on the catalyst. Hence, onl-y these light feedstocks with a boiling range less than 220 Â°C can be used. A composite oxide catalyst is used in some other patents. By ways of example of these<br>
25     catalysts, mention will be made of a catalyst comprising Zr02, Hf02 as main components, AI2O3, Cr203, MnO, Fe203 and oxides of alkaline metal of alkaline earth metal as an adjuvant (US 3725495, US 3839485); and Si02Al203 catalyst containing small amounts of Fe203, Ti02, CaO, MgO, Na20, and K20 (SU 550173, SU 559946). With the widespread application of zeolite in the petrochemical and petroleum processing,<br>
30 there appears the third class of catalysts, i.e., the catalysts comprising zeolite. In recent years, a shape selective additive is added into a catalyst to enhance the octane number of catalytic gasoline. For example, US 3758403 discloses a catalyst using ZSM-5 zeolite and a large pore zeolite (with a ratio of 1:10 to 3:1) as active components, and in addition to enhancing the<br>
2<br><br>
octane number of the gasoline, this catalyst provides a higher yield of C3 and C4 olefins, with a C3 and C4 olefins yield of roughly 10% by weight.<br>
When the catalyst contains a mixture of a zeolite with the MFI structure (silicon-rich five-member-ring zeolite) and a zeolite with a pore size greater than 7 angstrom is used in the 5 cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons to produce light olefins, the large pore zeolite (Y type zeolite mainly) is used to crack the feedstock to produce gasoline and diesel, which are further cracked into light olefins by the zeolite with the MFI structure (US 3758403, CN 1043520A, US 500649, and CN 1026242C). To increase the olefin selectivity of catalysts, the MFI zeolite is   further   modified   with,   for   examples,   transition  metals   (US 5236880),   phosphorus<br>
10    (CN1205307A,   US 6566293),   rare   earth   (CN 1085825A),   phosphorus   and   rare   earth (CN 1093101A, US 5380690, CN 1114916A, CN 1117518A, CN 1143666A), phosphorus and alkaline   earth   metals   (CN 1221015A,   US 6342153,   CN 1222558A,   US 6211104),   and phosphorus and transition metals (CN 1504540A). The zeolite beta has a 12 member-ring structure with intersected porous channels, wherein the<br>
15 pore diameter of the 12-member ring is 0.75-0.57 nm for the one-dimension porous channel parallel to the (001) crystal face, while the pore diameter of the 12 member-ring is 0.65-0.56 nm for the two-dimension porous channel parallel to the (100) crystal face. The zeolite beta is a silicon-rich large pore zeolite having a three-dimension structure that is the only one discovered up to now, and has both acid catalytic property and structural selectivity<br>
20 due to its structural particularity, and further has very high thermostability (the failure temperature of the crystal lattice is higher than 1200Â°C), hydrothermal stability and abrasion-resistant property. Due to the unique structural feature, the zeolite beta has good thermal and hydrothermal stability, acid resistance, anti-coking property and catalytic activity in a series of catalytic reactions; therefore it has been developed rapidly into a new-type of<br>
25 catalytic materials in recent years. Many uses of the zeolite beta in the cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons to produce light olefins are reported.<br>

transition metal M is represented in the mass percent of the oxides, the preferred range is:<br>
(0-0.2)Na2O(J -9)Al2Or(l ,5-7)P3O5-(0,9-l 0)M*Oy-(75-95)SiO2,	more	preferably<br>
25    (0-0.2)Na2O(l-9)Al2O3-(2-5)P2O5(l-3)MxOy(82-95)SiO2.<br>

Said zeolite beta modified with phosphorus and the transition metal M may be prepared by using various processes. For example, phosphorus and said transition metal M may be<br>
15 introduced (1) during the synthesis of the zeolite beta; or (2) by the steps of being exchanged with ammonium, being modified with phosphorus, being modified with said transition metal M, being calcined and the like after the synthesis of the zeolite beta.<br>
For example, said zeolite beta modified with phosphorus and the transition metal M may be prepared according to the following process. That is to say, a sodium-type zeolite beta<br>
20 obtained by a conventional crystallization is exchanged in a weight ratio of the zeolite beta: ammonium salt:H2O=l:(0.1-l):(5-10) at a temperature from room temperature to 100 Â°C for 0.5-2 hour, and filtered. Such an exchanging step is conducted for 1-4 times, so as to make the content of Na20 in the zeolite beta less than -0.2 wt%. Then, by impregnating or ion-exchanging, phosphorus  and one  or more  transition metals  selected from the group<br>
25     consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn and Sn are introduced into said exchanged zeolite beta to modify the zeolite beta, then dried, and calcined at 400-800 Â°C for 0.5-8 hours, wherein said calcination may be conducted at a steam atmosphere, so as to obtain the zeolite beta modified with phosphorus and the transition metal M. In the process for preparing the modified zeolite beta of the present invention, the modifying<br>
30    process by introducing phosphorus and the transition metal M into said zeolite can be carried out, for example, through an impregnation or ion-exchange method which is conventional in this art. The impregnation can be effected, for instance, through one of the three ways:<br>
10<br><br>
a.	An ammonium-exchanged zeolite beta filter cake is uniformly mixed with a predetermined<br>
amount of an aqueous solution of a phosphorus compound at a temperature from room<br>
temperature to 95Â°C, then dried, and calcined at 400-800Â°C, the resultant solid is uniformly<br>
mixed with a predetermined amount of an aqueous solution of a compound containing one or<br>
5    more transition metals M selected from Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn and Sn at a temperature from room temperature to 95Â°C, then dried;<br>
b.	An ammonium-exchanged zeolite beta filter cake is uniformly mixed with a predetermined<br>
amount of an aqueous solution of a phosphorus compound at a temperature from room<br>
temperature to 95Â°C, then dried, the resultant solid is uniformly mixed with a predetermined<br>
10 amount of an aqueous solution of a compound containing one or more transition metals M selected from Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn and Sn at a temperature from room temperature to 95Â°C, then dried, wherein the impregnation sequence of aforementioned two aqueous solutions can be also reversed; and<br>
c.	An ammonium-exchanged zeolite beta filter cake is uniformly mixed with a predetermined<br>
15    amount of a mixed aqueous solution containing a phosphorus compound and a compound<br>
containing one or more transition metals M selected from Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn and Sn at a<br>
temperature from room temperature to 95Â°C, then dried.<br>
Said ion exchange may be given for instance as the following method.<br>
The ammonium-exchanged zeolite beta filter cake is uniformly mixed with a predetermined<br>
20 amount of an aqueous solution of a phosphorus compound at a temperature from room temperature to 95Â°C, then dried, and calcined at 400-800Â°C, the resultant solid is uniformly mixed with a predetermined amount of an aqueous solution of a compound containing one or more transition metals M selected from Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn and Sn in a solid/liquid ratio of l:(5-20), stirred at 80-95Â°C for 2-3 hours, then filtered, the exchange step can be repeated<br>

Moreover, the sodium content in said sodium-type<br>
15 zeolite beta should satisfy the requirement on the sodium content in the anhydrous chemical formula of the zeolite beta comprising phosphorus and said transition metal M. If the sodium content does not satisfy the requirements, the ammonium-exchanging method may be used to remove sodium in said starting sodium-type zeolite beta. In this respect, said ammonium-exchanging step is not essential in the preparation of said modified zeolite beta.<br>
