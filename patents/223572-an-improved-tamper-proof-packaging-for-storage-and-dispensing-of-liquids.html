SECTION 10 TITLE<br>
"An improved tamper proof-packaging for storage and dispensing of liquids".<br>
APPLICANT<br>
MARICO INDUSTRIES LIMITED, "Rang Sharda", K. C. Marg, Bandra Reclamation, Bandra (West), Mumbai-400 050, An Indian Company,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Original<br>
529/MUM/2002	1 3 MAR 2007<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to packaging for storage and dispensing of liquids products. PRIOR ART<br>
Moulded jars for storage and dispensing of tiquidous products, such as edible oil, are known in the art. Such jars are normally blow moulded from high density polyethylene (HDPE). Oil is filled into such jars and a closure is then sealed to the neck of the jar. Such a method of sealing was effected by either one of the following methods.<br>
1.	heat sealing with aluminum foil<br>
2.	heat sealing with low density polyethylene (LDPE) plug and aluminum foil<br>
3.	induction sealing with aluminum foil<br>
Except for the method of sealing with plug and foil, an unauthorized access to oil can be easily effected by an unauthorized user. Further, though aluminum foils are printed with the name and trade mark of the original manufecturer, it can be reproduced for pilferage and reuse. The technology involved in heat sealing needs low level of knowledge and investments, which further contributes to tampering by an unauthorized user. Briefly, such known methods did not provide tamper proof properties.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a moulded jar for storage and dispensing of a liquidous products, such as edible<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a moulded jar for storage and dispensing of liquidious products which prevents dripping of the liquid during a dispensing operation, which otherwise is difficult particularly for the pack sizes of 2/3/5 litres.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved tamper proof packaging for storage and dispensing of liquids comprising a moulded jar provided with a handle and neck to accommodate a closure in which the neck is provided with a tear-away pull ring so as to tear open the flap, characterized in that closure comprises pourer and top-cap wherein the neck having a circular spout of radius such as 12mm constituting pouring direction and to stop pouring; a top-cap providing protection to spout as well as to oil from dust, pests and rodents; ends of the tear-away pull ring is provided with a triangular wedge facilitating tear away action, pourer is provided with welding rib on its bottom at both ends and flange adjacent to the rib to be accommodated inside the jar neck for tight grip, and neck is a flat horizontal flange constituting a surface for spin welding.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
This invention will now be illustrated with accompanying figures which illustrated an<br><br><br>
emooaiment 01 present invention ana are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying figures:<br>
Fig. 1 : Shows the overall construction of the packaging of the present invention<br>
Fig. 2 : Shows the construction of top-cap, pourer, and the moulded jar.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, the tamper-proof packaging for liquids comprises a moulded jar (1) having a neck (2) which is designed to accommodate a closure which offers pouring convenience and makes it tamper-proof. The closure further comprises of two-parts pourer (3) and top-cap (4). The neck has a circular spout (6) of radius 12mm for pouring direction and to cut the oil flow when consumer intends to stop pouring. A tamper ring or tear-away pull ring (7) with holding width of 5mm to pull away is provided around the neck of jar to tear open the flap and close the jar with top-cap.<br>
The jar is blow moulded from any thermoplastic such as high density polyethylene (HDPE). The jars are, for example, without intending any limitation, blown for 2 litre and 5 litre sizes. The jars are provided with a handle for easy pouring and carrying. The neck of the jar has preferably diameter of 30 ± 1 mm and preferably a height of 10mm. Neck forms a flat horizontal flange which forms a surface for spin welding. This surface is around 2.75mm horizontally provided which is required for sight spin welding operation. The neck forms a stop of 5mm height with preferred diameter of 51.5mm which is required for supporting pressure in spin welding operation. Pourer is provided with welding rib (7) on its bottom at both ends and flange (8) adjacent to the rib to be accommodated inside the jar neck for tight grip.<br><br><br>
The pourer is made from a blend of 60% HDPE, 20% LDPE and 20% EVA or a blend of HDPE, LLDPE, EVA and LDPE or any of the individual material of the above. The pourer is made by injection moulding with precise processing time and controls. The pourer is preferably made of 60% HDPE as the material forms a chemical bond with jar neck. This bond forms a joint stronger than the base material and also the joint formed is leak proof. The pourer perforrn four basic functions namely spin welding with jar neck for 1st degree tamper, tear away pull ring described in the ensuing description, for 2nd degree tamper, easy pourer for drip/glug free pouring and leak proof closure over jar neck.<br>
Tear-away tamper ring or tearway pull ring has preferably diameter of 23mm for easy entry of first finger and holding width of 5mm to pull away. End of tear-away ring pillar forms a triangular wedge of 2mm equilateral triangle which helps in easy tear away action. Tear away tamper ring leaves an opening which is enough for easy and glug free pouring. 40% EVA in pourer material helps in tearing action.<br>
Pourer also forms a vertical wall of 1.5mm thick and 6mm in height to engage a top-cap through double start, standard thread of 0.75mm height. In case of a rare occasion, if oil drop drips from spout, it will be caught in the gap of 1.5mm thickness and 6mm height between spout and vertical threaded wall leaving jar's outer surface smear-free<br>
Top cap is made by injection moulding and is made of poly proplyne or HDPE, LDPE,<br><br><br>
LLDPE or any blend of any of the above material. The cap is designed to protect spout area and oil contained from exposing to environment in storage condition. It provides protection from dust accumulation on spout surface and from pests and rodents. Top-cap has preferably a height of 14mm and dia of 38.5mm which is ergonomically designed for easy grip for closing and opening. It also has fine ribs over perjpjheryior easy grip, easy opening and to ensure light closing of the cap. The cap has a corner filler of radius preferably 2.25mm to smoothen the edge. Top cap engages with pourer through double start thread of 0.75mm projection over 6mm height.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments incorporating the concepts and features of the present invention, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br>
