DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, when a user cuts off power of a certain chamber of plural<br>
chambers, a power-off state display apparatus of a refrigerator and a method<br><br>
thereof which are capable of displaying a power-off state of a pertinent chamber<br>
will be described in detail with reference to accompanying Figures 3 - 5.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating a power-off state display apparatus<br>
of a kimchi refrigerator in accordance with the present invention<br>
As depicted in Figure 3, the power-off state display apparatus includes a<br>
signal generating unit 31 generating a power-off signal (character signal) when a<br>
user turns off power of a first chamber of plural (a first ~ a N) chambers installed to<br>
a refrigerator; a control unit 32 outputting the power-off signal or a control signal<br>
for displaying a preset kimchi fermentation time; and a display unit 33 displaying a<br>
power-off state by receiving the power-off signal or displaying the preset kimchi<br>
fermentation time by receiving the control signal Herein, when the power-off signal<br>
is inputted, the control unit 32 outputs only the inputted power-off signal to the<br>
display unit 33 In addition, when the power-off signal is not inputted, the control<br>
unit 32 outputs only the control signal to the display unit 33 Herein, each of the<br>
first ~ the N chambers is independently controlled..<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the power-off state display apparatus of the<br>
kimchi refrigerator in accordance with the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to accompanying Figure 4,<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating a power-off state display method of a<br>
kimchr refrigerator in accordance with the present inventipon<br>
First,thesignal generating unit:31 u<br>
dges whether the user turns off power<br>
of each of the first ~ the N chamhers. For example, when the user chooses<br>
(pushes) a power-on/off button (reference numeral 6 in Figure 1) installed at a<br>
certain side of the first chamber, the signal generating unit 31 generates a power-<br>
off signal. Herein, it is preferable to set the certain time as three seconds. In more<br><br>
detail, when the user turns off power of the first chamber by pushing a pertinent<br>
the power-on/off button for three seconds, the power-off signal is generated, and<br>
accordingly contents of the first chamber can be kept stably as shown at step S11<br>
The control unit 32 receives the power-off signal from the signal<br>
generating unit 31 and outputs the power-off signal to the display unit 33 installed<br>
at the certain side of the first chamber. When the power-off signal is not inputted<br>
from the signal generating unit 31, the control unit 32 outputs the control signal to<br>
the display unit 33 Herein, the control unit 32 continually checks a power-off signal<br>
input in order to judge whether power of other chambers (the second - the N<br>
chamber) are turned off by the user.<br>
After that, the display unit 33 receives the power-off signal outputted from<br>
the control unit 32 and displays the power-off state of the first chamber. Herein, a<br>
liquid crystal display and a plasma display panel, etc can be used as the display<br>
unit 33 In addition, it is preferable to minimize waste of parts by displaying the<br>
power-off state through a 7-segment display displaying the preset kimchi<br>
fermentation time, rather than additionally installing the display unit 33 at the<br>
certain side of the chamber Hereinafter, the display unit 33 displaying the power-<br>
off state will be described in more detail with reference to accompanying Figure 5<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a display unit, which displays a power-off state, of the power-off<br>
state display apparatus of the kimchi refrigerator in Figure 3<br>
As depicted in Figure 5, in the present invention, without additionally<br>
installing the display unit 33 to the refrigerator in order to display a power-off state,<br>
the 7-segment display, which is installed to the kimchi refrigerator and displays a<br>
kimchi fermentation time, displays a power-off state of each chamber (the first ~<br>
the N chambers). In more detail, the 7-segment display displays "OFF" characters<br><br>
after receiving the power-off signal or display the kimchi fermentation time after<br>
receiving the control signal<br>
In the meantime with the exception of the display unit 33 displaying the<br>
power-off state of the first refrigerator, each display unit of the rest of the chambers<br>
(the second - the N chamber) are off. In more detail, the display units respectively<br>
installed at the front surface of the chambers (the second ~ the N chamber)<br>
indicate an operation state by displaying a normal function (the kimchi<br>
fermentation time) as shown at step S13<br>
As described above, in a power-off state display apparatus of a refrigerator<br>
and a method thereof in accordance with the present invention, when a user turns<br>
off power of a certain chamber, because a power-off state of a pertinent chamber<br>
is displayed, the user can accurately recognize each operation state of plural<br>
chambers installed to a refrigerator.<br>
In addition, in a power-off state display apparatus of a refrigerator and a<br>
method thereof in accordance with the present invention, when a display unit (7-<br>
segment display unit) is off due to its failure or a refrigerator's failure, because a<br>
power-off state of a pertinent chamber is displayed, a user can quickly recognize<br>
the failure<br>
In addition, in the present invention, because a user can quickly recognize<br>
a failure, it is possible to improve a usability of a refrigerator.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, because a power-off signal is<br>
generated only when a user pushes a power button of a certain chamber for three<br>
seconds, it is possible to prevent power-off errors due to a user's mistake or button<br>
handling greenness,<br>
In addition, in the present invention, by preventing power-off errors of a<br><br>
certain chamber due to a user's mistake or button handling greenness, contents of<br>
a pertinent chamber can be safely preserved<br>
In addition, in the present invention, when a user turns off power of a<br>
certain chamber, a 7-segment display, which is installed to the kimchi refrigerator<br>
to display a kimchi fermentation time, displays "OFF" characters, and accordingly<br>
waste of parts due to additional functions can be minimized.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also- be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
