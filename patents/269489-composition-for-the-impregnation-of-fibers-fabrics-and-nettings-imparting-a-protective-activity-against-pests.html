AS ORIGINALLY FILED<br>
Composition for the impregnation of fibers, fabrics and nettings imparting a pro¬tective activity against pests<br>
The present invention relates to an insecticide composition ior application to a textile material or plastics material selected from the group consisting of yarn, fibers, fabric, knitgoods, nonwovens. netting material, foils, tarpaulins and coating compositions. which insecticide composition comprises a mixture including at least one insecticide and/or at least one repellent, and at least one binder; an impregnated textile material or plastics material comprising at least one insecticide and/or at least one repellent, and at feast one binder; processes for impregnation of a textile material or plastics material and a process for coating of a textile material or plastics material.<br>
Infectious diseases cause huge damages by debilitating or even killing humans and animals in many countries, especially in tropical countries. Many of these diseases (e.g. malaria, dengue and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) are transmitted by insects. Since many medical methods like vaccination or medical treat¬ments are either impossible or too expensive or have been rendered ineffective due to spreading resistance against drugs, efforts have been concentrated on controlling the transmitting insects. Methods to control these insects comprise treating surfaces of huts and houses, air spraying and impregnation of curtains and bednets. The latter treatment is up to now mostly done by dipping the textile material into emulsions or dispersions of insecticides or spraying them onto the nets. Since this provides only a loose adhesion of the insecticide molecules on the surface of the fibers, this treatment is not uvasivpennesneiit and has to be repeatea after eacn washing. Studies have proven long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LUNs) to be more reliable in preventing carrier-borne diseases in comparison with conventional nets, which have to be re-impregnated with insecticide after each washing. Experience shows, however, that washed nets are not re-treated in many cases leaving them without any biological ac¬tivity. WHO, UNICEF and global relief organisations therefore recommend pre-treated, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets which are wash-permanent as an effective means for the containment of deadly tropical diseases, especially malaria and dengue fever. This is not only comfortable for the user but gives him an economic advantage as well, saving the costs for the repeated impregnation, it is an ecological advantage as well, since the permanent treatment is done under controlled conditions in textile finishing plants.<br>
WO 01/37662 discloses impregnated nettings or fabrics for insect or tick killing and/or epellent of an insect or tick comprising an insecticide and/or a repellent, and a film<br><br>
forming component reducing the wash off and degradation of the insecticide compo¬nent from the netting or fabric by forming a water- and optionally an oil-resistant iiim. The film forming component preferably comprises one or more components selected from paraffin oil or wax derivatives, silicon derivatives, silicon oils or wax derivatives, and poiyfluorocarbon derivatives. The netting or fabric is impregnated by adding a solu¬tion or a water emulsion of an insecticide and/or repellent and a film forming compo¬nent successively (in two steps) or in or\e process step. According to the specification of WO 01 ■'37662 is the insecticide and'or repellent dissolved in an organic solvent in the process for impregnation of a fabric or a netting.<br>
WO 03/034823 discloses an insecticide composition for application to a fabric material, which composition comprises a mixture including an insecticide, a copolymeric binder, that, after drying and while the fabric materia! is dry, imparts hydrophobicity to the in¬secticide, and a dispersing agent, that, after application of the composition to a fabric and upon wetting the fabric, reduces the hydrophobicity imparted to the insecticide by the binder to permit limited insecticide release. The copolymeric binder is prepared as a copolymer emulsion that is derived by an emulsion polymerization technique from monomers selected from at least one of the groups including a) vinyl esters of aliphatic acid having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate and vinyl versatate; b) acrylic and methacrylic esters of an alcohol having 1 to 13 carbon atoms, such as butyl acry-late, 2~ethylhexylacrylate, and methyl acrylate; and c) mono- and di-ethylenically un¬saturated hydrocarbons, such as styrene, and aliphatic diens, such as butadiene. The preferred copolymeric binder is prepared by emulsion polymerisation ot two different monomers. The insecticide composition of WO 03/034823 is applied to the fabric or netting by dipping, spraying, brushing, and the like. According to the examples the in¬secticides have to be dissolved in organic solvents before applying the insecticide composition to a fabric material.<br>
US 5,631,072 discloses the manufacture of fabric intended to be made into washable garments, more specifically to the placement of an insecticide such as permethrin in the fabric by impregnation with polymeric binders and a cross-linking agent, or by sur¬face coating with a polymeric binder and a thickening agent lo improve the efficiency as an insect repellent and retention of the permethrin in the fabric as an effective insecti¬cide through successive washings of the garments. According to the examples, suit¬able binders are acrylic binders and polyvinylacetate binders, which are not further specified. The amount of insecticide in the solutions for impregnation of the fabric is very high (1250 mg insecticide per m2).<br>

The aim o1 the invention is to control a variety of pests, such as ticks, cockroaches, bed bugs, mites, fleas, lice, leeches, horseflies, mosquitoes, termites, ants, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, crickets, silverfish. also in form of their larvae and eggs, and other flying and crawling insects, and molluscs, e.g. snails and slugs, and rodents, eg. rats and mice as well as fungi, e.g. fungi causing athlete's foot.<br>
The textile material or plastics material may be made form a variety of natural and syn¬thetic fibers, also as textile biends in woven or non-woven form, as knit goods, yarns or fibers. Natural fibers are for example cotton, wool, silk, jute or hamp. Synthetic fibers are for example polyamides, polyesters, polyacryl nitriles, polyolefines, for example polypropylene or polyethylene, Teflon, and mixtures of fibers, for example mixtures of synthetic and natural fibers. Polyamides, potyolefins and polyesters are preferred. Polyethylene terephthalate is especially preferred.<br>
According to the present invention the term textile material or plastics material also discloses non-textile substrates such as coating compositions, leather, synthetic adap¬tions of leather, flocked fabrics, sheetings, foils and packaging material.<br>
Most preferred are nettings made from polyester, especially polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The textile material or plastics material may be in form of coverings, for example bed¬clothes, mattresses, pillows, duvets, cushions, curtains, wall coverings, carpeting and window, cupboard and door screens. Further typical textile materials or plastics materi¬als are geotextiles. tents, inner soles of shoes, garments, such as socks, trousers, shirts, i.e. preferably garments, e.g. uniforms, used in body areas exposed to insecti¬cide bites and the like as well as horse blankets. The nettings are for example used as bed nets for example mosquito nets, or for covering or as nets in agriculture and vini¬culture. Other applications are movable fences for the protection of humans and ani¬mals against air-borne low-flying insects. Fabrics or nettings may be used for pack¬ages, wrapping sacks, containers for food, seeds and feed thus protecting the material from attack by insects but avoiding direct contact with the insecticide-treated nets or fabrics.<br>
Treated foils or tarpaulins can be used on all human premises which are permanently or temporarily inhabited such as refugee camps.<br><br>
It is further possible to use the treated nettings in dwellings having mud walls. A treated netting is pressed into a fresh, wet wall mud before it dries. The mud will ooze into the noles in the net but the yarn of the net will not be covered. When this wall covering is dried the insecticide and/or repellent of the treated net is slowly released and can repell or kill pests that come into contact with the wall.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for applica¬tion to polyester nettings as used for mosquito nets.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention may be applied to textile materials or plastics materials before their formation into the desired products, i.e. while still a yarn or in sheet form, or after formation of the desired products.<br>
Insecticide and/or repellent (component A)<br>
According to the present invention the term insecticide and/or repellent also discloses besides insecticides and repellents rodenticides, fungicides, molfuscicides, larvicides and ovicides.<br>

It is possi¬ble to add polymer seed to the polymerization mixture to adjust the particle size of the emulsion polymers obtained.<br><br>
The emulsion polymerization is preferably carried out in the presence at least one ini¬tiator which form radicals under the polymerization conditions. Suitable initiators are for example all common peroxy compounds or azo compounds.<br>
Suitable peroxides are for- example alkali metal peroxodisulfates. for example sodium peroxodi sulfate, ammonium peroxodisulfate; hydrogen peroxide' organic peroxides, for example diacety! peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, diamylperoxide. dioctanoyl peroxide. didecanoyl peroxide, dilauroyl percxide, dibenzol peroxide, bis-(o-toloyl}peroxide. suc-cinyi peroxide, lert-butyl peracetate, tert-butyl permaleinate. tert-butyl perpivalate. tert-butylperoctoate, tert-butyl pemeodecanoate, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl-peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, and diisopropy! peroxodicarbamate. Further suitable initiators are azo compounds, for example azobis isobutyronitrile, anzobis(2-amidopropane)dihydrochloride, and 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile).<br>
The initiators are added in usual amounts, for example in an amount of 0.05 to 5 % by weight, preferably 0.05 to 2 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers.<br>
!f the polymerization is carried out at low temperature, use may be made of conven¬tional redox catalysts. For example, it is possible to use, in addition to the peroxide catalysts of the above kinds, from 0.05 to 2 % by weight, based on the total of mono¬mers, of reducing agents such as hydrazine, soluble oxidizable sulfoxy compounds such as alkali metal salts of hydrosulfites, sulfoxylates, thiosulfates, sulfites, and btsul-fites, which may be optionally activated by the addition of traces of heavy metals, e.g. salts of Ce, Mo, Fe, and Cu, in the usual manner.

The polymerization process is carried out until a conversion of at least 95 % by weight of the monomers is reached. For removal of the residual monomer at the end of the emulsion polymerization initiator may be added for chemical deodoration.<br>
The emulsion polymerization is carried out by adding emulsifiers or mixtures of emulsi-fiers known in the art. The emulsifiers generally used are ionic (anionic or cationic) and/or non-ionic emulsifiers such as polyglycolethers, sulfonated paraffin hydrocar-<br><br>
bans, higher alkyisulfates such as oley! amine, laurylsulfate. alkali metal salts of fatty acids suet""* as sodium stearate and sodium abate, sulphuric acid esters of fatty alco¬hols, ethoxylated C6.i:-alkylphenols. usually having from 5 to 30 ethylene oxide radi¬cals, and their sulfonation products, and also sulfosuccinic acid esters. The emulsifier<br>
or mixtures of emulsifiers are usually employed in an amount of 0.05 to 7 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 4 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers.<br>
In some cases there is added a co-solvent or a mixture of co-solvents to the emulsifi¬ers. Preferred co-solvents are aliphatic C-;- to C3.raicohols which are linear or branched, alicyclic C3- to C3C-alcohols and mixtures thereof. Examples are n-butanol, n-hexanol, cyclohexanol. 2-ethylhexanol, i-octanole, n-octanole, n-decanole. n-dodecanole, stearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol or cholesterol.

The co-solvents or mixture of co-solvents is added in an amount of 0 to 20 % by weight, preferably 1 to 5% by weight. In many cases use is also made of a protective colloid, examples of which are polyvinyl alcohol, partially saponified polyvinyl acetates, cellulose derivatives, copolymers of methyl acrylate with acrylic amide and methylacrylic amide or vinyl pyrrolidine polymers in amounts of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight and in particular 1.0 to 5 % by weight of the weight of the monomers.<br>
Further, it is possible to add in genera! up to 10 % by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5 % by weight of mono- or di-olefinically unsaturated monomers containing reactive or cross-linking groups. Examples of such monomers are in particular the amides of a,B-olef'^'cally unsaturated C; --carhnvyiic ^'^ particularly anryl amides, methacrvt am¬ides and maleic diamides, and their N-methylol derivatives such as N-methylol acrylic amide, N-methyiol methacrylic amide, N-alkoxy methyl amides of c,p-monoolefinical!y unsaturated C3.5-carboxylic acids such as N-methoxy methacrylic amide and N-n-butoxymethylacrylic amide, vinyl sulfonic acid, monoesters of acrylic and methacrylic acids with alkanediols such as glycol, butanediol-1,4, hexane diol-1,6, and 3-chloropropanediol-1,2, and also allyl and methallyl esters of a.p-olefinically unsaturated mono- and di-carboxylic acids such as diallyl maleate, dimethyl allyl fumarate, allyl acrylate and allyl methacrylate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl terephthalate, p-di-vinyl ben¬zene, methylene-bis-acrylamide and ethylene glycol di-allylether.<br>
The solids content of the aqueous dispersions of polymers obtained in the emulsion polymerization is usual 15 to 75 % by weight, preferably 25 to 50 % by weight. To ob¬tain high space time yields of the reactor dispersions having a high solids content are preferred. To obtain solids contents of more than 60 % by weight a bi- or polymodal<br><br>
particle distribution should be adjusted, because otherwise it is not possible to handle the dispersion, because of the high viscosity. New particle generations (tor obtaining bi-or polymode! particle size distributions) are for example formed by addition of seed IEP-A 0 810 831), addition of an excess of emulsifier or addition of mini-emulsions. The formation of new particle generations may be carried out at any time and is depending on the desired particle size distribution for a low viscosity.<br>
The molecular weight of the non crossiinked emulsion polymers obtained is in general 40.000 to 250,000 (determined by GPC). The molecular weight is usually controlled by the use of conventional chain stoppers in conventional amounts. Conventional chain stoppers are for example sulfoorganic compounds.<br>

The aqueous formulation or the melt preferably comprises the insecticide composition as disclosed in the present invention, which is preferably employed in form of an aque¬ous formulation.<br>
In the context of the present invention "impregnation" is a process for applying the in¬secticide composition. This process may include a process for curing the applied insec¬ticide composition to achieve a coating onto the textile material or plastics material, if desired. An "impregnated textile material or plastics material" is a material onto which the insecticide composition is applied. The "impregnated textile material or plastics ma¬terial" may be coated by curing the applied insecticide composition, if desired.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention may also be applied onto the tex¬tile or plastics material by transfer printing, inkjet printing, a screen process, and pow¬der printing.<br>
Suitable textile materials or plastics materials are mentioned before. It is possible to impregnate the textile or plastics material in form of its finished product (end of line treatment, discontinuous treatment). In *nis case no further pass is necessary after im¬pregnation. However, it is also possible to impregnate the textile or plastics material in form of a yarn or fibers, which have to be further processed after impregnation to obtain<br><br>
the desired finished product (in line treatment). Preferred insecticides and/or repellents used are also defined before as well as preferred acrylic binders and'or polyurethanes.<br>
The discorittnuous ireatmerV. may be performed in factories, in local treatment centers (local factories; or even with mobile equipment which is e.g. mourned on trucks or pick¬ups (e.g. in re-treatment antimalaria campaigns). The discontinuous treatment may be done on new (untreated textile materials oer plastics materials, preferaoly nettings, in use or made-up form (preferably as neis) or on used textile materials or plastics mate¬rials 'preferably ^etsV preferably a^ter washing.<br>
It is one advantage of the present invention that the impregnation is carried out in an aqueous formulation or in a melt. It is not necessary to add any organic solvents. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the treatment bath is an aqueous formu¬lation which does not comprise any further solvents, especially no organic solvents.<br>
It is advantageous to avoid the use of organic solvents because the textile material or plastics material of the present invention may be used in close contact to the human body.

These aqueous formula¬tions or melts are suitable for impregnation of the textile material or plastics material with at least one insecticide and/or repellent and additionally coloring the textile mate¬rial or plastics material at the same time. Many of the textile materials or plastics mate¬rials which are impregnated with at least one insecticide and/or repellent are preferably colored. With the process of the present invention it is possible to color and impregnate the textile material or plastics material with an insecticide and/or repellent at the same :ime. The method of the present invention is therefore very economical, because the ;oloring and impregnation with an insecticide and/or repellent is carried out in one step.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the present invention therefore relates to a process for impregnation of a textile material or plastics materia1 as described be¬fore, wherein the dyeing of (he texiiie material o:: plastics materia! is carried out simul¬taneously with the impregnation of tne texiiie mareria! or plastics material, wherein an  aqueous formulation is formed further comprising at least one dyestuff and'or at least one pigment.<br>
Suitable amounts of pigments are in general 0.01 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 °: by weight, more preferab'y 0.2 to 5 -* by weight, based on the weight of the aqueous formulation used for impregnation.

This step is known by a person skilled in the art as padding, In a preferred embodiment the textile material or plastics materia! is com¬pletely submerged in the aqueous treatment liquor (aqueous formulation) either in a trough containing the liquor or passed through the treatment bath (aqueous formula¬tion) which is held between two horizontally oriented rollers.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the textile material or plastics material may either be passed through the aqueous formulation or the aqueous formulation may be passed through the textile material or plastics material. These processes are preferred for im-<br><br>
pregnating open-width material which is later tailored into nets. For small-scale produc¬tion or re-impregnating of non-treated nets, use of a simple hand-held roller might be sufficient.<br>
Step iib)<br>
U is further possible to apply the aqueous formulation onto the tsyjiie material or plas¬tics material by one-side only-coating applications methods. Suitable one-side only-coating application methods are for example knife- 'doctor-blade-coating, roller coating or screen-printing. By this methods it is possible to impregnate only one side of the textile material or plastics material which is advantageous, if e.g. direct contact of the human skin with insecticide-treated material is to be avoided.<br>
Knife-/doctor-blade-coating systems are for example knife-over-air-systems, knife-over-roller systems, knife-over-table systems or knife-over-rubber-belt systems. Further knife coating systems are for example commabar or Mayerbar knife systems.<br>
Roller-coating systems are for example kiss-coating systems with one, two, three or more rollers, reverse-roll-coater systems and raster roll systems. In these roller-coating systems at least one roller is partly dipped into the aqueous formulation thus applying the aqueous formulation to the side of the textile material or plastics material in contact with the roller (kiss-rolling).<br>
Screen-printing systems are for example rotary-screen printing systems and flat-screen printing systems. With these applications methods a dot coating or a full-surface coat¬ing can be applied to the textile material or the plastics material, for example by using £■-1 ""^^'tion'^! ,"htsner-b!ade behind the rotan/-screen<br>
A person skilled in the art will adjust the viscositiy of the aqueous formulation used by applying thickeners where appropriate.<br>
Step iic)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulations to the textile material or plastics material by double-side coating application methods, for example double-side knife-coating systems, foulard with two air-knifes or foulard with squeezing rollers.<br>
By using the double-side-knife-coating system or by passing two times through a one-side-only coating system, it is possible to apply the aqueous formulation only to the surfaces of both sides of the textile material or plastics material and thus to reduce the quantitiy of the aqueous formulations needed for a certain effect.<br><br>
Stsp iid) and step he)<br>
It is furthe, possioie tc apply trie aqueous formulation by spraying the solution or emul¬sion onto the textile material C plastics material, further il is possible, to apply the emulsion in the form of a foam which is applied to the textile materia! or plastics mate¬rial. A foam comprises less water than the solution or emulsion mentioned above. T'rte drying process may therefore be very short.<br>
Step ilf), iig) and step iih)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulation onto the textile material or plas¬tics material by submerging the textile material or plastics material into the aqueous formulation, brushing the aqueous formulation onto or into the textile material or plas¬tics material, or pouring the aqueous formulation onto the textile material or plastics material. Said methods are known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Impregnation of the fabric material or netting in step iia), iib), iic), iid), iie), iif), iig), or iih) is carried out at temperatures of in general from 10 to 70 °C, preferably 15 to 50 JC, more preferably 20 to 40 °C.<br>
Step Hi) Optionally removing the surplus aqueous formulation<br>
The surplus aqueous formulation is usually removed by squeezing the textile material or plastics materia!, preferably by passing the textile material or plastics material rollers<br>
ac knnwn in the ?rr   iypfprqhlv hv mpan« of Hnntnr hlprip   thus achieving R defined Iiq-<br>
uor uptake. The squeezed-off liquor is usually re-used.<br>
The surplus aqueous formulation may alternatively be removed by centrtfuging or vac¬uum suction.<br>
Step iv) Drying and/or curing the textile material or plastics material<br>
The drying is in general carried out temperatures below 200 °C. Preferred tempera¬tures are from 50 to 170 °C, more preferably from 70 to 150 DC. The temperature choice is a function of the evaporation temperature and mobility of the insecticide in the formulation.<br><br>
It should be noted that the drying process may be s. passive drying as the process may be carried out in rather hot climates An active drying process would normally be per¬formed during high scale processing.<br>
i After or simultaneously to the drying the impregnated textile- material or plastics mate¬rial is optionally finally cured and';or fixated. A person skilled in the art knows how to carry out a curing and/or fixation. The curing process is in general carried out at a tem¬perature which may be higher than the d-ying temperature. Preferred temperatures for curing are 60 to 170 "C. preferably 70 to 170 °C. more preferably 80 to 150 ;C. Drying and curing can be advantageously be performed during one single process, e.g. in stenters with different compartments which can be heated to different temperatures. If a reactive crosslinking agent is used temperatures may be lower, e.g. 30 to 130rjC, preferably 30 to 100°C.<br>
The drying and/or curing may be achieved in any equipment usually applied in textile mills for these purposes, such as stenters. loop dryers, hotflues, tumble dryers, pad steam machines etc. In one embodiment of the present invention, equipment for con¬tinuous drying and/or curing is applied. In another embodiment of the present invention, equipment for discontinuous (batch-wise) drying and/or curing is used. Such equipment may comprise rotary or tumble dryers used in professional laundries, combined laun¬dry/dryers which may be heated to the treatment temperatures, e.g. jeans stone-wash. The treatment chemicals may be added as a liquid or be sprayed onto the netting ma¬terial and then brought to a homogeneous distribution by rotating the wet material be¬fore or during drying/curing. The treatment liquor may be added in excess if it is possi¬ble to remove the excess liquor e.g. by centrifuging. A person skilled in the art will be aware that treatment times might be longer than in the continuous process at the same temperature.<br>
The curing process may also include or consist of passing the textile material or plas¬tics material by a heated surface under pressure such as an iron or a heated roller. During drying processes and curing the textile material or plastics material is preferably mechanically fixated in a way to prevent change of the form e.g. shrinkage or dimen¬sional deformation. Further, is is prevented that the insecticide and/or repellent is washed out. The curing and/or fixation may be alternatively carried out by a dual-cure process combining heat and UV-light or only by UV-light, Suitable processes are known by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>

ii) adding an aqueous formulation comprising at least one insecticide and/or repel¬lent;<br>
iii) heating the aqueous bath to a temperature of 100 to 140DC and keeping the tem¬perature for 20 to 120 minutes;<br>
and<br>
iv) cooling and draining the bath, and rinsing and drying the impregnated textile ma¬terial or plastics material.<br>
Steps i) to iv) of the impregnation process are described in detail above. Examples<br>
Binder:<br>
A) Preparation of polymer dispersions<br>
General procedure:<br>
250 g of water and 3 g of a styrene seed {33 % by weight) having a medium particle<br>
diameter of 30 nm are heated to 85 °C and 5 % by weight of feed 2 are added. After 10<br>
min. addition of feed 1  comprising the monomers mentioned below a^d feed 2 is<br>
started.<br>
Feed 2 comprises 3.0 g sodiumperoxidsulfate dissolved in 39.9 g of water. The composition of feed 1 is listed in table 1.<br><br>
Feed 1 and 2 are added in 3 h, and it was polymerized fof further 0.5 h.<br><br><br><br>
The amount of initiator sodium peroxidisulfate is 0.3 pa^ts by weight, the emulsifier comprises C.4 parts by weight of Dowfax 2A1 (Dow) und 0.5 parts by wsight of Lumiten IRA (BASF AG), relating to 100 parts by weight of the monomer composition of zabls 1.<br><br><br><br>
The long-lasting insecticidal treatment was performed with aqueous dispersions ac¬cording to examples A1 - A17 on commercially available white polyester netting mate¬rial (fiber titer 75 denier, 156 mesh, weight 28-32 g/m2) without prior washing. The aqueous treatment baths were prepared by mixing the aqueous dispersions with com¬mercially available emulsions of insecticide and/or repellent, setting pH with buffer solu¬tions and adding a fixative (if needed). The concentrations of the treatment baths were adjusted according to the liquor uptake possible (LU between 60 and 100 %). The treatment baths were applied by using a padder-stenter equipment on a laboratory scale (Mathis AG, Switzerland). The netting material is fully immersed into the treat¬ment bath and excess liquor is removed by passing it through cylinders which move in counter-direction. By choosing a defined distance between these cylinders (and thus a defined pressure) the liquor uptake can be controlled. The liquor uptake is measured by weighing an impregnated piece of netting and subtracting the weight of the dry, un¬treated netting and is given as % weight of liquor on weight of netting. The dry¬ing/curing step was performed in a laboratory stenter which allows to control the tem¬perature and time of the treatment.<br>
The treated nettings have been washed different times as mentioned in table 2 (see column "Knock-down 60 min"; the statement in parenthesis (number plus w) indicate? how often the netting has been washed before the tesing was carried out). The wash¬ing was carried out by the "Montpeilier washing procedure" {as described in the annex WHO PVC, 3/07/2002 "Evaluation of wash resistance of long-lasting insecticidal nets"): Net samples are washed individually in beakers containing 0.5 L deionised water and 2 g/L soap (pH 10-11) at 30 DC in a water bath shaken for 10 minutes in clean water at<br><br>
155 movements per minute, ""he soap used comprises (among further components like etidronic acid and sodium hydroxide or coconui acid, tetra sodium EDTA and limonens) the following ingredients: Sodium tallowate, water, sodium palm kerneiate or sodium cocoate, perfume, glycerol, sodium chloride and some dyestuff (C.I. 77391).<br>
Samples were bioassayed according to the cone testing procedure described below.<br>
Testing procedure:<br>
The testing follows the basic guidelines of WHO cone testing procedures with a few modifications. Cones (WHO cones (WHOPES 96.1): clear plastic cone structures (11 cm diam.) with a flat flange around the bottom edge and a hole at the apex) are held against treated net pieces (25 x 25 cm) via a hand-made manifold apparatus modeled similarly to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) methodology. The manifold device used is made by cutting four holes (9 cm diameter) in a plastic serving tray (30.5 x 41.0 cm, Consolidated Plastics). An unmodified tray of the same dimen¬sions acts as a base. Onto the surface of the base tray two pieces of blotter paper are placed, cut to fit inside the tray. A piece of treated netting is then placed onto the blot¬ter paper followed by four WHO cones placed to roughly correspond to the positioning of the holes cut in the manifold (top) tray. This top tray is then placed over the cones so they pass through the hoies. The top tray is then securely fastened to the base tray using four large binder clips. The blotter paper helps to ensure a reasonably tight fit of the cones to the netting. Mixed sex mosquitoes, 1-5 days old. are removed from a rearing cage with an aspirator and _:a. 5 mosquitoes placed into each cone. A lab timer is started after the introduction of insects into the first cone with each cone supplied with mosquitoes ca. 15 seconds apart, taking one minute to fill all the cones. Each cone is plugged with a rubber stopper immediately after introduction of the insects. Mosquitoes are held in each cone for three minutes where each insect typically rests on the netting surface (if treatment is not strongly repellent). If any mosquito rests on the wall of a cone then the cone can be tapped gently to relocate the insect to the net¬ting. After three minutes, the insects are all removed by aspirator and placed into a plastic holding cup, combining mosquitoes from all four cones, which represent a single replicate. Four replicates of each treatment are recommended. The holding cup con¬sists of a clear plastic cup (9 cm tall x 6.5 cm wide) with a plastic screw-on lid. A 1 cm hole in the lid is used to insert the aspirator for insect deposition. One set of mosqui¬toes from each cone is collected and deposited into the holding container si a time.<br><br>
Between insertions of the aspirator tip into the container [id. an overhead transparency marker is used to piug the hoie to prevent insect escape. After all four cones have been emptied of insects into the holding container, the hole is then plugged with a cot¬ton dental wick soaked with 10% sugar water. The end of the wick sticKing out of the cup shouid have the end manually flattened somewhat to ensure that it doesn't fall into the cup and aliow mosquito escape. Knockdown (KD) data are generally taken from the pooled mosquitoes at 60 minutes and 24-hours. A 30-minute for other) reading can be included if deemed necessary. For speed of knockdown, the mosquito csn be left in the cone and the time to KD recorded for each individual mosquito. Each KD mosquito is removed as it goes down to prevent recounting that insect if it once again, flies. All mosquitoes are tnen heid as described previously for a 24-hour Mortality count.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example C<br>
5 kg untreated netting material was put into a rotary dryer and 5 Liters of treatment bath, comprising 10 g/L of polymer according to example A17, 6.4 g/L Alphacyperme-thrin as a dispersion. 0.56 g.!L fixative agent (isocyanurate based on HMDI which is nydrophilized with a polyethylene oxide and which is dissolved in propylene carbonate (70 % by weight of HMD! in 30 % by weight of propylene carbon ate) ;the amount of free isocyanate groups is 11 to 12 % by weight, based on the amount of isocyanate used as staring material for the preparation of the isocyanurate:the boiling point of the fixa¬tive agent is 240-245°C, and the viscosity is 280 mPa.s (Brookfieid 100 U/min) and set to pH 6 with a buffer solution, were sprayed onto the material at room temperature. The dryer was heated to 80 °C while rotating the material and kept at 80 aC for 15 minutes while rotating. The treated netting was washed up to 15 times following the protocol described earlier ("Montpellier washing procedure") and bioassayed as described above,<br>
Results: Knock-down after 60 minutes: 98.9 % Mortality after 24 hours: 93.5 %.<br><br><br><br>
