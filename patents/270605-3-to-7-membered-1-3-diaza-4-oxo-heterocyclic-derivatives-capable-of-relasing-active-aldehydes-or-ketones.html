				<td>3- TO 7-MEMBERED l,3-DIAZA-4-OXO-HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES<br>
CAPABLE OF RELEASING ACTIVE ALDEHYDES OR KETONES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention provides 3- to 7-membered l,3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic<br>
derivatives capable of releasing in a controlled manner a biologically active aldehyde or<br>
ketone into the surrounding. The invention also relates to the use of these compounds as<br>
perfuming or flavoring ingredients, as well as to the perfuming compositions and<br>
consumer articles containing such derivatives. It also provides a process for preparing<br>
said heterocyclic derivatives of the invention.<br>
Prior art<br>
Many active compounds are highly volatile and can thus only be perceived over a<br>
limited period of time. Extensive research has therefore been performed in order to find<br>
new efficient precursors allowing a controlled release of active volatile molecules,<br>
particularly in the field of perfumery and flavoring. The prior art discloses some<br>
precursors, which are able to prolong or enhance the effect of active molecules such as<br>
fragrances. Nevertheless none of the prior art documents discloses the 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-<br>
heterocyclic derivatives of the invention as precursors for the controlled release of<br>
aldehydes and ketones.<br>
In WO 00/02991, the reaction of amines with a carbonyl compound to form<br>
imines, capable of releasing a perfume, is described. However, the imines formed are<br>
difficult to use in liquid applications, due to their relative instability.<br>
V. Jurcik and R. Wilhelm in Tetrahedron 2004, 60, 3205-3210, recently reported<br>
the preparation of aminals in water. Two different secondary amines and several diamines<br>
(giving aminals with 5- to 7-membered rings) are used to synthesize aminals.<br>
Nevertheless, the structures of the described compounds are significantly different from<br>
the 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic derivatives of the invention and no evidence is provided<br>
in that publication for a possible use of these compounds to control the release of volatile<br>
active aldehydes and ketones. The article focuses on aminals as synthons for biologically<br>
active compounds.<br>
Related structures used as precursors for the controlled release of aldehydes or<br>
ketones are also reported in WO 00/24721 and 02/38120 where oxazolidines are<br>
described. However, these compounds are very different since the chemical stability and<br>
reactivity of ester derivatives are pretty different from the ones of amide derivatives, i.e.<br>
of the invention's compounds. Therefore these documents do not anticipate the present<br>
invention.<br>
Heterocyclic systems reported in the prior art are often either too stable or too<br>
unstable and are therefore rather unsuitable as delivery systems for the controlled release<br>
of volatiles in practical applications. It is therefore necessary to reach an optimal balance<br>
between stability and unstability so as to obtain a release rate of the precursors as<br>
required for the different applications, a task which is very difficult to achieve. WO<br>
02/38120, for example, describes photolabile precursors of oxazolidines, presumably to<br>
increase the stability of the oxazolidine moiety against hydrolysis. Nevertheless,<br>
photolabile delivery systems are often not ideal for practical applications, as their release<br>
rates depend on the light-intensity to which the precursor is exposed. Therfore, there is<br>
still a need to develop new delivery systems that are sufficient stable against hydrolysis<br>
during product storage and which release the active substance by hydrolysis without<br>
relying on additional release triggers such as light or enzymes.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found 3- to 7-membered 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic<br>
derivatives are sufficiently stable against acidic hydrolysis but allow an efficient release<br>
of bioactive aldehydes or ketones in applications. The compounds of the present<br>
invention thus increase the long-lastingness of a biologically active aldehyde or ketone in<br>
applications by providing a controlled release system of these active compounds.<br>
By the term "active" we mean here that the aldehyde or ketone to which it is<br>
referred is capable of bringing a benefit or effect into its surrounding environment, and in<br>
particular a perfuming, flavoring, masking, pharmaceutical, agrochemical, insect repellent<br>
or attractant, bactericide, insecticide and/or fungicide effect. Therefore, for example, said<br>
"active aldehyde or ketone" possesses at least one property which renders it useful as<br>
perfuming or flavoring ingredient, as insect repellent or attractant or as pharmaceutical,<br>
insecticide, bactericide or fungicide. Preferred active aldehydes or ketones are perfuming<br>
or flavoring ingredients, iasect repellents or attractants, bactericides or fungicides.<br>
Particularly preferred active aldehydes or ketones are perfuming or flavoring ones.<br>
According to all the above and below mentioned embodiments of the invention,<br>
the invention's compounds are particularly useful when the active aldehyde or ketone is a<br>
perfuming ingredient, i.e. a perfuming aldehyde or ketone. A "perfuming aldehyde or<br>
ketone" is a compound, which is of current use in the perfumery industry, i.e. a<br>
compound which is used as active ingredient in perfuming preparations or compositions<br>
in order to impart a hedonic effect. In other words, such an aldehyde or ketone, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art of<br>
perfumery as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a<br>
composition, and not just as having an odor. From now on we will refer to said<br>
"perfuming aldehyde or ketone" also as "perfuming compounds".<br>
The invention is carried out exactly in the same manner, independently of the<br>
exact properties of the active aldehyde or ketone. Therefore, it is understood that, even if<br>
the invention will be further illustrated herein below with a specific reference to<br>
"perfuming compounds", the below embodiments are also applicable to other active<br>
aldehydes or ketones (i.e. it is possible to replace the expression "perfuming" with<br>
"flavoring", "insect attractant", "insect repellent", "masking", "pharmaceutical",<br>
"fungicide", "insecticide" or with "bactericide", for instance).<br>
The compounds of the invention are 3- to 7-membered 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-<br>
heterocyclic derivatives capable of releasing in a controlled manner a biologically active<br>
aldehyde or ketone and are defined by the following formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
- n represents an integer varying between 0 and 3;<br>
- R1 and R2 are the residues of an aldehyde or ketone, of formula R1CHO or R1R2CO<br>
respectively, said aldehyde or ketone having a molecular weight comprised between<br>
80 and 230 g/mol and having a perfuming, flavoring, masking, pharmaceutical,<br>
agrochemical, insect repellent or attractant, bactericide, insecticide and/or fungicide<br>
effect;<br>
- R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted<br>
by one group of formula COOR9, R9 representing a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl or<br>
alkenyl group;<br>
- R4 represents a hydrogen atom, or a C1-C12 alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group optionally<br>
comprising from 1 to 5 oxygen atoms;<br>
- R5, R6, R7 and R8 represent, simultaneously or independently from each other, a<br>
hydrogen atom, or a C1-C12 alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group optionally comprising from 1<br>
to 5 oxygen atoms and/or one sulphur atom and/or one, two or three nitrogen atoms;<br>
R4 and R5, or R7 and R5, taken together, may form a C2-C6 alkanediyl or alkenediyl<br>
group optionally comprising one oxygen atom; if n is not 0, R5 and R , taken together<br>
with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, may form a carbonyl group.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said compound of<br>
formula (I) can be those wherein:<br>
- n represents 0 or 1;<br>
- R2 represents a hydrogen atom and R1 is the residue of an aldehyde of formula<br>
R1CHO, said aldehyde having a molecular weight comprised between 80 and 230<br>
g/mol and having a perfuming, flavoring, masking, pharmaceutical, agrochemical,<br>
insect repellent or attractant, bactericide, insecticide and/or fungicide effect;<br>
- R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl group;<br>
- R4 represents a hydrogen atom, or a C1-C4 alkyl group optionally comprising one or<br>
two oxygen atoms;<br>
- R5 and R6 represent, simultaneously or independently from each other, a hydrogen<br>
atom, or a C1-C10 alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group, optionally comprising from 1 to<br>
5 oxygen atoms and/or one sulphur atom and/or one, two or three nitrogen atoms; R<br>
and R5, taken together, may form a C3-C4 alkanediyl group optionally comprising one<br>
oxygen atom;<br>
- R7 and R8 represent, simultaneously or independently from each other, a hydrogen<br>
atom, or a C1-C4 alkyl group optionally comprising one or two oxygen atoms; R7 and<br>
R5, taken together, may form a C3-C4 alkanediyl group optionally comprising one<br>
oxygen atom.<br>
It is understood when, herein above or herein below, a group is defined as being<br>
"alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group" it is meant that said group can be in the form of a linear,<br>
branched or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl group, in the form of an aryl group optionally<br>
substituted with alkyl or alkenyl groups or also in the form of a mixture of said type of<br>
groups, e.g. a specific group may comprise a linear alkyl, a branched alkenyl, a<br>
(poly)cyclic alkyl and an aryl moiety, unless a specific limitation to only one type is<br>
mentioned.<br>
According to any of the embodiments, the compound of formula (I) is<br>

biologically active aldehyde or ketone (of formula R1CHO or R1R2CO respectively)<br>
having specific molecular weight. According to a particular embodiment of the invention,<br>

ketone is advantageously characterized by a vapor pressure above 2.0 Pa, as obtained by<br>
calculation using the software EPIwin v. 3.10 (2000, available at the US Environmental<br>
Protection Agency). According to another embodiment, said vapor pressure is above 5.0,<br>
or even above 7.0 Pa.<br>

glutaminamide, glycinamide, histidinamide, leucinamide, isoleucinamide,<br>
norleucinamide, lysinamide, methioninamide, phenylalaninamide, 2-phenylglycinamide,<br>
prolinamide, serinamide, threoninamide, tryptophanamide, tyrosinamide, valinamide,<br>
isoasparaginamide, isoglutaminamide and amide of aspartic acid or glutamic acid, with<br>
glycinamide and prolinamide being particularly preferred. Several aminoacetamide<br>
derivatives are commercially available.<br>
In particular cysteinamide has a R configuration and all other aminoacetamides<br>
have a S configuration, as the natural amino acid from which they are derived. So, the 3-<br>
to 7- membered 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic derivatives of the invention, which are<br>
derived from natural animo acids, are expected to have a good biocompatibility. The<br>
same is true for their degradation products. Therefore, said compound of formula (I) may<br>
constitute a particularly interesting new precursor for the controlled release of active<br>
aldehydes or ketones.<br>
Owing to their particular chemical structure, the invention's compounds are<br>
capable of releasing, via a decomposition reaction, a residue and a biologically active<br>
ketone or aldehyde. The decomposition reaction, which leads to the release of the<br>
perfuming compounds, is believed to be influenced by pH changes or by heat, but may<br>
also be triggered by other types of mechanisms.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of the above-described<br>
compounds of formula (I) for the controlled release of a perfuming ingredient. In other<br>
words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of<br>
a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article by the controlled release of a perfuming<br>
aldehyde or ketone, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an<br>
effective amount of at least an invention's compound. By "use of an invention's<br>
compound" it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing said<br>
compounds and which can be advantageously employed in perfumery industry as active<br>
ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming<br>
ingredient, are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one of the invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from<br>
a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties<br>
of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-1-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not a compound according to the invention.<br>
Moreover, by "perfuming co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in a<br>
perfuming preparation or composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a<br>
co-ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person<br>
skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor<br>
of a composition, and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability and etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one of the invention's<br>
compounds and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the<br>
invention as well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one of the invention's<br>
compounds, at least one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at<br>
least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one of the invention's compounds or other precursors of<br>
similar type is important as it enables the perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes,<br>
possessing the odor tonality of various compounds of the invention, creating thus new<br>
tools for their work.<br>
Furthermore, an invention's compound, or a perfuming composition comprising it,<br>
is a useful perfuming ingredient, which can be advantageously used in all the fields of<br>
modern perfumery, such as fine perfumery or functional perfumery. Indeed, the<br>
invention's compounds may be advantageously employed in fine or functional perfumery<br>
to achieve a more controlled deposition, and consequent release, of perfuming<br>
compounds. For example, the compounds according to the invention, owing to a good<br>
substantivity, a low volatility and a well controlled release of odoriferous molecules, can<br>
be incorporated in any application requiring the effect of rapid or prolonged liberation of<br>
an odoriferous component as defined hereinabove and furthermore can impart a fragrance<br>
and a freshness to a treated surface which will last well beyond the rinsing and/or drying<br>
processes. Suitable surfaces are, in particular, textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin.<br>
Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one of the invention's compounds as defined above;<br>
and<br>
ii) a consumer product base;<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactively effective amount of at least<br>
one of the invention's compounds.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents<br>
and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely<br>
perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses,<br>
creams, oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care<br>
products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As<br>
detergents there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning<br>
products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or<br>
hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other<br>
perfumed articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
In particular, we have found that the invention's compounds are particularly well<br>
suited for articles having an acidic pH, such as comprised , e. g., between 2.5 and 7.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention's compounds, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
Preferred perfuming compositions or perfumed articles are perfumes, fabric<br>
detergents or softener bases.<br>
Typical examples of fabric detergents or softener composition into which the<br>
compounds of the invention can be incorporated are described in WO 97/34986 or in<br>
US patents 4,137,180 and 5,236,615 or EP 799 885. Other typical detergent and softening<br>
compositions which can be used are described in works such as Ullman's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, vol. A8, pages 315-448 (1987) and vol. A25, pages 747-817 (1994);<br>
Flick, Advanced Cleaning Product Formulations, Noye Publication, Park Ridge, New<br>
Jersey (1989); Showell, in Surfactant Science Series, vol. 71: Powdered Detergents,<br>

(4th, 1998, Montreux, Switzerland), AOCS print.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent upon the nature of the article or product to be<br>
perfumed and on the desired olfactory effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in<br>
a given composition when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with<br>
perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, typical concentrations are in the order of 0.001% to 10% by weight,<br>
or even more, of the compounds of the invention based on the weight of the composition<br>
into which they are incorporated. Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of<br>
0.001% to 5% by weight, can be used when these compounds are applied directly in the<br>
perfuming of the various consumer products mentioned hereinabove.<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to a method for the perfuming of a<br>
surface or to a method for intensifying or prolonging the diffusion effect of the<br>
characteristic fragrance of an odoriferous ingredient on a surface, characterized in that<br>
said surface is treated in the presence of an invention's compound. Suitable surfaces are,<br>
in particular, textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin.<br>

Stability of 1.3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocvclic derivatives against acidic hydrolysis<br>
The stability of the 3- to 7-membered 1,3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic derivatives according<br>
to the invention against acidic hydrolysis was tested by NMR-spectroscopy in a<br>
phosphate buffer solution (in D2O/CD3OD 1:1).<br>
For the measurements, an acidic deuterated phosphate buffer stock solution was prepared<br>
from 2.07 g of ortho-phosphoric acid (origin: Fluka), 1.46 g of monobasic KH2PO4<br>
(origin: Acros) and 77.36 g (= 70 ml, D20°c = 1.105 g/ml) of deuterium oxide. To<br>
determine the pH of the final reaction solution, 0.5 ml of the buffer stock solution were<br>
diluted with 0.5 ml of CD3OD to give a final mixture of D2O/CD3OD 1:1 (v/v). The pH of<br>
this solution was measured to be 2.75 at 26.4°C, and the corresponding pD value was<br>
calculated with the formula pD = pHmeasured + 0.33 to be 3.08.<br>
10 mM product solutions were then prepared by adding 0.35 ml of CD3OD and 0.1 ml of<br>
2-(2-phenylpropyl)imidazolidin-4-one (11.0 mg in 0.3 ml of CD3OD) or 0.1 ml of<br>
(±)-(7a5)-3-(2-phenylpropyl)hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-C]imidazol-1-one (8.8 mg in<br>
0.4 ml of CD3OD), respectively, to 0.45 ml of the above described phosphate buffer stock<br>
solution. 1H-NMR spectra of these solutions were recorded after 2 and 5 days on a Bruker<br>
AV 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz. No hydrolysis of the precursors was observed under<br>
these conditions.<br>

Performance of a fabric softener base comprising 1.3-diaza-4-oxo-heterocyclic<br>
derivatives<br>
The controlled release effect of the compounds of formula (1) is evidenced by headspace<br>
analysis on dry fabric one and three days after treatment with a fabric softener comprising<br>
this compound. Higher amounts of free aldehydes and ketones are detected in the samples<br>
treated with the compounds of the invention as compared to the corresponding reference<br>
sample with the free fragrance aldehyde or ketone. The tests have been performed in the<br>
following way.<br>
A fabric softener base (pH ca. 3.14) was prepared with the following ingredients:<br><br>
The release over time of active aldehydes/ketones from the compounds of the invention<br>
as compared to the corresponding unmodified free aldehyde/ketone was determined in the<br>
following experiments:<br>
In a 1 1 beaker, 1 ml of a solution of 2-(2-phenylpropyl)imidazolidin-4-one (A, 36.0 mg in<br>
2 ml of ethanol) or(±)-(7aS)-3-(2-phenylpropyl)hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-C]imidazol-1-<br>
one (B, 36.1 mg in 2 ml of ethanol), respectively, were added to 1.80 g of the<br>
homogenized fabric softener base and filled up with 600 g of demineralized cold tap<br>
water. Two cotton sheets (EMPA cotton test cloth Nr. 221, origin: Eidgenossische<br>
Materialpriifanstalt (EMPA)), pre-washed with an unperfumed detergent powder and cut<br>
to ca. 12 x 12 cm sheets) were added to each beaker and agitated manually for 3 min, left<br>
standing for 2 min, then wrung out by hand and weighed to estimate the quantity of<br>
residual water. As a reference sample, 1 ml of a solution containing an equimolar amount<br>
of unmodified Trifernal® (65.3 mg and 54.7 mg in 5 ml of ethanol for A and B,<br>
respectively) was added to another 1.80 g of the original fabric softener base which was<br>
treated as described above. All cotton sheets were line-dried for 1 or 3 days, respectively.<br>
One of the dry cotton sheets was put into a headspace sampling cell (internal volume ca.<br>
160 ml), thermostatted at 25°C and exposed to a constant air flow of ca. 200 ml/min,<br>
respectively. The air was filtered through active charcoal and aspirated through a<br>
saturated solution of NaCl, corresponding to a constant humidity of ca. 75%. During 15<br>
min the volatiles were adsorbed onto a waste Tenax® cartridge, then during 15 min on a<br>
clean Tenax® cartridge. The sampling was repeated 7 times every 60 min (45 min<br>
trapping on the waste cartridge and 15 min on a clean cartridge). All experiments were<br>
carried out in duplicate. The cartridges were desorbed on a Perkin Elmer TurboMatrix<br>
ATD desorber coupled to a Carlo Erba MFC 500 gas chromatograph equipped with a<br>
J&amp;W Scientific DB1 capillary column (30 m, i.d. 0.45 mm, film 0.42 mm) and a FID<br>
detector. The volatiles were analyzed using a two steps temperature gradient starting from<br>
70°C to 130°C at 3°C/min and then going to 260°C at 25°C/min. The injection<br>
temperature was at 240°C, the detector temperature at 260°C. Headspace concentrations<br>
(in ng/1) were obtained by external standard calibrations using five different<br>
concentrations of the aldehyde in ethanol. 2 ml of each calibration solution were injected<br>
with a microliter syringe onto three clean Tenax® cartridges, respectively. All the<br>
cartridges were desorbed immediately under the same conditions as those resulting from<br>
the headspace sampling. The following average amounts of aldehydes were detected on<br>
dry fabric from the sample containing compound of the invention as compared to the free<br>
reference aldehyde (in brackets) after 1 and 3 days:<br><br>
The data show that higher amounts of the corresponding aldehyde were released into the<br>
headspace from the invention's compound as compared to the free active compound.<br>
Despite their inherent stability against hydrolysis in an aqueous buffer solution (see<br>
Example 2), 2-(2-phenylpropyl)imidazolidin-4-one and (±)-(7aS)-3-(2-phenylpropyl)<br>
hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-C]imidazol-1-one surprisingly release the desired active<br>
aldehydes or ketones at suitable rates in practical applications. In contrast to many prior-<br>
art precursors, the compounds according to the present invention seem to represent an<br>
ideal compromise between sufficient product stability against acidic hydrolysis and<br>
efficient release rate upon hydrolysis in practical applications.<br>
