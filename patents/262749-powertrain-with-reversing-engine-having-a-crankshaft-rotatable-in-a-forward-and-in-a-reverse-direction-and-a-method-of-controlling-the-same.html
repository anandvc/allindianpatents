HYBRID POWERTRAIN WITH REVERSING ENGINE<br>
AND METHOD OF CONTROL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a powertrain having an engine and an<br>
electrically variable transmission, wherein a crankshaft of the engine can be<br>
controlled to rotate in two different directions, as well as to a method of controlling a<br>
powertrain.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Hybrid automotive powertrains have typically used pure electric or<br>
series electric operation to provide reverse torque at a transmission output member.<br>
Pure electric operations utilize battery power to power a motor which is controlled to<br>
turn a transmission member, such as a gear, in a direction resulting in reverse rotation<br>
of the output member. In series electric operation, engine power allows one motor to<br>
operate as a generator that provides electricity to power a second motor which in turn<br>
drives a transmission member in a direction to provide a reverse rotation at the output<br>
member. Vehicle reverse performance, particularly for steep grades and long<br>
distances at high or low temperatures, is therefore limited by battery or motor<br>
behavior in both of these types of powertrains. Utilizing the engine, rather than motor<br>
power, to provide reverse, in either a fixed ratio mode or an electrically variable<br>
mode, typically requires the addition of one or more gears dedicated for use in the<br>
reverse mode, thereby adding length to the transmission and decreasing efficiency due<br>
to clutch drag and spin losses.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A powertrain is provided having an engine operable in a reverse<br>
direction so that a reverse mode is provided through an electrically variable<br>
transmission without relying on pure electric or series electric operation, and without<br>
the addition of a dedicated reverse gear.<br>
[0004]	Specifically, a powertrain is provided having an engine with a<br>
crankshaft rotatable in a first direction and in a second direction. A controller is<br>
configured to control direction of the crankshaft. The powertrain further includes an<br>
electrically variable transmission that has an input member, such as in input shaft,<br>
operatively connected with the crankshaft and an output member, such as an output<br>
shaft, for providing driving torque. The output shaft rotates in a forward direction<br>
when the crankshaft rotates in the first direction, and rotates in a reverse direction<br>
when the crankshaft rotates in the second direction. Thus, forward and reverse torque<br>
are alternately provided.<br>
[0005]	More specifically, the engine may include an engine block forming<br>
cylinders and a respective intake valve and exhaust valve for each cylinder. The<br>
valves are openable and closable for allowing combustion of gas within the cylinders<br>
to cause rotation of the crankshaft in the first direction.<br>
[0006]	The electrically variable transmission may include a transmission<br>
gearing arrangement characterized by an absence of a reverse gear. The input shaft is<br>
operatively connected with the engine crankshaft such that torque is transferred from<br>
the crankshaft to the transmission input shaft and ultimately to the output shaft, which<br>
rotates in a forward direction when the crankshaft rotates in the first direction.<br>
[0007]	The controller is be configured to selectively change the direction of<br>
the engine crankshaft so that the engine crankshaft rotates in a second direction<br>
causing the transmission output shaft to rotate in a reverse direction. Thus, the<br>
direction of rotation of the engine crankshaft determines whether a forward or reverse<br>
torque is provided at the transmission output shaft, and a power flow path from the<br>
transmission input member to the transmission output member is identical regardless<br>
of the direction of rotation of the crankshaft. As used herein, a "power flow path" is<br>
defined as the components of the electrically variable transmission (i.e., the shafts and<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
gears) along which power flows (i.e., which carry torque) from the input member to<br>
the output member. The engine that may be referred to as a "reversing engine" as it is<br>
controllable to provide crankshaft rotation in two directions corresponding with<br>
rotation of the transmission output member in a forward direction and a reverse<br>
direction.<br>
[0008]	The electrically variable transmission further includes a<br>
motor/generator operatively connected to the transmission gearing arrangement. An<br>
energy storage device, such as a battery, is operatively connected to the<br>
motor/generator for providing power to and receiving power from the motor/generator<br>
to thereby vary speed of rotation of the transmission output shaft.<br>
[0009]	Preferably, the electrically variable transmission is controllable by the<br>
controller to selectively provide both a fixed ratio operating mode and an electrically<br>
variable operating mode. Either of these modes may be selected when the crankshaft<br>
rotates in the first direction or when the crankshaft rotates in the second direction<br>
(e.g., a fixed ratio operating mode and an electrically variable operating mode are<br>
available in both forward driving and reverse driving). As used herein, a "mode" is a<br>
particular operating state, whether encompassing a continuous range of speed ratios or<br>
only a fixed speed ratio, achieved by engagement of one or more particular torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms. Because the direction of rotation of the transmission output<br>
member is determined by the direction of rotation of the crankshaft, and not by the<br>
use of any reversing gears, identical power flow paths through the electrically variable<br>
transmission may be used for forward modes as for reverse modes.<br>
[0010]	Various alternative embodiments are provided that enable the<br>
crankshaft to rotate in a second direction such that reverse torque is provided. In one<br>
embodiment, high authority, electrically-actuated cam phasers are used to shift the<br>
order of intake and exhaust valve operation to provide reverse operation. Specifically,<br>
the intake valves are operatively connected to a first overhead camshaft that causes<br>
opening and closing thereof, and the exhaust valves are operatively connected to a<br>
second overhead camshaft that causes opening and closing of the exhaust valves. A<br>
respective, electrically-actuated cam phaser is operatively connected to each of the<br>
camshafts and is operable for varying the phasing of the overhead camshaft relative to<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
the crankshaft. The cam phasers each have phasing authority of at least 180 degrees<br>
crank angle; 90 degrees cam angle, so that the crankshaft may rotate in the first or<br>
second direction in response to the cam phasers with proper gas flow through the<br>
intake and exhaust plumbing.<br>
[0011]	In another alternative embodiment, cam-switching mechanisms are<br>
utilized to reverse the order of intake and exhaust valve operation. Specifically, the<br>
first overhead camshaft operatively connected to the intake valves and the second<br>
overhead camshaft operatively connected to the exhaust valves each have a respective<br>
forward cam lobe and reverse cam lobe for each respective valve. The cam-switching<br>
mechanism is controlled to selectively connect respective forward and reverse cam<br>
lobes with the valves to control whether the crankshaft rotates in the first direction or<br>
the second direction such that the forward or reverse driving torque is provided at the<br>
transmission output shaft, respectively.<br>
[0012]	Yet another embodiment for an engine having overhead camshafts is to<br>
provide a three dimensional cam for each respective valve. The three dimension cam<br>
has both a forward and reverse cam profile. One or more actuators axially translate<br>
each camshaft so that the three dimensional cams transition between the forward and<br>
reverse cam profiles under the control of the controller to provide crankshaft rotation<br>
in the first or second direction, respectively, depending on whether forward or reverse<br>
torque is desired at the transmission output shaft.<br>
[0013]	Yet another embodiment uses a camless valve actuation system, with<br>
the controller selectively causing opening and closing of the valves so that the<br>
crankshaft rotates in the first and the second directions in response to the camless<br>
valve actuation system. The camless valve actuation system may be of an electro-<br>
hydraulic or electro-magnetic type, as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0014]	Using any of these embodiments to provide a shift in the order of the<br>
intake and exhaust valve operation, the engine can be restarted using the hybrid<br>
transmission motor and the valves controlled to provide crankshaft rotation in the<br>
second direction corresponding with reverse torque at the transmission output shaft.<br>
The transmission can be controlled to establish the same electrically variable and,<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
preferably, fixed ratio operating modes that are available in the forward direction, but<br>
with a reverse torque at the transmission output shaft.<br>
[0015]	In a powertrain having an electrically variable transmission, engine<br>
accessories are typically electrically driven via a dedicated motor or via one of the<br>
motor/generators of the electrically variable transmission. Some accessories however,<br>
such as engine pumps for oil and coolant flow, are typically driven by the engine<br>
crankshaft or camshaft. Accordingly, alternative embodiments for ensuring correct<br>
rotation of crankshaft-driven accessories and pumps are provided, to ensure rotation<br>
even when the crankshaft rotates in the second direction. For example, an accessory<br>
device, such as a dual-drive air conditioning compressor, may be driven by the engine<br>
crankshaft via an endless rotatable device such as a chain or belt. In such an<br>
embodiment, the controller is configured to control the powertrain so that the<br>
accessory device is driven by the engine through the endless rotatable device when<br>
the crankshaft rotates in the first direction, but is driven by a motor operatively<br>
connected to the accessory device when the crankshaft rotates in the second direction<br>
due to the change in operation of the intake and exhaust valves.<br>
[0016]	Additionally, structure may be provided to ensure that crankshaft-<br>
driven pumps, such as an engine pump for oil and coolant flow, are able to maintain a<br>
predetermined flow regardless of the direction of rotation of the crankshaft. Thus,<br>
such a pump that is operatively connected with the controller and drivingly connected<br>
with the crankshaft for providing a predetermined flow of fluid when the crankshaft<br>
rotates in the first direction may also provide the predetermined flow of fluid when<br>
the crankshaft rotates in the second direction. This is accomplished via an<br>
electrically-actuated reversing valve in fluid communication between the crankshaft<br>
and the pump and operatively connected to the controller. The controller is<br>
configured to actuate the electrically-actuated reversing valve when the crankshaft<br>
rotates in the second direction.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0017]	Alternatively, for accessories driven by the engine crankshaft through<br>
an auxiliary drivetrain, engine drive may be utilized regardless of the direction of the<br>
rotation of the engine crankshaft by providing a rotating member, such as a gear or<br>
sprocket, that is selectively engageable via the controller with the auxiliary drivetrain<br>
when the crankshaft rotates in the second direction to change the direction of rotation<br>
of the auxiliary drivetrain so that the accessory is driven in the same predetermined<br>
direction as when the engine crankshaft rotates in the first direction.<br>
[0018]	A method of controlling the powertrain is associated with any of the<br>
above described powertrain embodiments. Specifically, a controller is configured to<br>
carry out the method by receiving a request for rotation of the output shaft in either<br>
the forward direction or the reverse direction. The request may be associated with a<br>
vehicle operator shifting a selector between a forward drive mode and a reverse drive<br>
mode. Under the method, intake and exhaust valves of the engine are then lifted<br>
according to a first predetermined phasing with respect to rotation of the crankshaft,<br>
thereby causing the crankshaft to rotate in a first direction that corresponds with<br>
rotation of the output member in the forward direction if the received request is for<br>
rotation of the output shaft in the forward direction. Conversely, if the received<br>
request is for rotation of the output member in the reverse direction, the method<br>
includes lifting the intake and exhaust valves according to a second predetermined<br>
phasing with respect to rotational of the crankshaft. The second predetermined<br>
phasing substantially opposes the first predetermined phasing, thereby causing the<br>
crankshaft to rotate in a second direction that corresponds with rotation of the output<br>
member in the reverse direction. A power flow path through the transmission is the<br>
same when the valves are lifted according to the first phasing as when the valves are<br>
lifted according to the second phasing.<br>
[0019]	Depending on the structure to cause lifting of the intake and exhaust<br>
valves, the lifting steps in the method may include actuating cam phasers operatively<br>
connected to the valves, engaging a different respective cam profile with each of the<br>
valves, or axially moving a camshaft characterized by different respective cam<br>
profiles, as described with respect to the various embodiments above.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0034]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 depicts a powertrain 10 having an engine 12 operatively<br>
connected to an electrically variable transmission 14. The engine 12 is controllable to<br>
provide reverse torque at an output member 16 (also referred to herein as an output<br>
shaft) of the transmission 14 by changing the direction of rotation of the engine<br>
crankshaft 18, as described below. This allows reverse torque to be provided using<br>
engine power, without requiring that any additional gears be added to the electrically-<br>
variable transmission (i.e., any dedicated gear used only for a reverse operating mode,<br>
referred to herein as a "reverse gear") and without requiring that the reverse torque be<br>
provided electrically, by the motor-generators 20A and 20B included in the<br>
transmission 14. The reverse torque is thus not limited by the electrical power<br>
available to the motor/generator.<br>
[0035]	The crankshaft 18 is operatively connected for rotation with an input<br>
member 21 of the transmission 14 through a torque-transfer device 22. The<br>
electrically variable transmission 14 includes a transmission gearing arrangement 23<br>
that utilizes three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 to interconnect the input member<br>
21, the output member 16 and the motor/generators 20A, 20B to establish various<br>
powerflow paths from the input member 21 to the output member 16, depending on<br>
which of the various torque-transmitting mechanisms, brake CI, clutch C2, brake C3<br>
and clutch C4 are engaged, as well as whether the motor/generators 20A, 20B are<br>
respectively operating as motors or as generators. Planetary gear set 24 includes ring<br>
gear member 30, sun gear member 32, and carrier member 36 that rotatably supports<br>
planet gears 34 that intermesh with both the ring gear member 30 and the sun gear<br>
member 32. Planetary gear set 26 includes ring gear member 38, sun gear member<br>
40, and carrier member 44 that rotatably supports planet gears 42 that intermesh with<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
both the sun gear member 40 and the ring gear member 38. Planetary gear set 28<br>
includes ring gear member 46, sun gear member 48 and carrier member 52 that<br>
rotatably supports planet gears 50 that intermesh with both sun gear member 48 and<br>
ring gear member 46. Interconnecting member 54 continuously interconnects sun<br>
gear member 32 with ring gear member 38 and with motor/generator 20A.<br>
Interconnecting member 60 continuously interconnects carrier member 36 with carrier<br>
member 44 and is selectively connectable with carrier member 52 via engagement of<br>
clutch C2.<br>
[0036]	As those skilled in the art will readily understand, a controller 25 is<br>
operatively connected to the motor/generators 20A, 20B, as well as to an energy<br>
storage device 27, such as a battery, to selectively transfer power from the energy<br>
storage device 27 to either of the motor/generators or vice versa, and to control the<br>
respective direction of rotation of each of the motor/generators. When the powertrain<br>
10 is used in a land vehicle, the transmission output member 16 may be connected to<br>
the vehicular axles (not shown) that may, in turn, terminate in the drive members (also<br>
not shown). The drive members may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on<br>
which they are employed, or they may be the drive gear of a track vehicle.<br>
[0037]	A drive gear 29 may be presented from the input member 21. As<br>
depicted, the drive gear 29 fixedly connects the input member 21 to the outer gear<br>
member of the first planetary gear set 24, and the drive gear 29, therefore, receives<br>
power from the engine 12 and/or the motor/generators 20A and/or 20B. The drive<br>
gear 29 can be operatively connected to a transmission pump or a power take-off unit<br>
to drive various vehicle accessories, as explained with respect to Figures 8-10<br>
described below.<br>
[0038]	Figure 2 is a chart showing the torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
engagement schedule and operating conditions of the motor/generators to provide<br>
various forward operating modes for the powertrain 10. Two electrically-variable<br>
modes are provided (Launch/EVT Mode 1 and EVT Mode 2) as well as four fixed<br>
ratio modes (denoted as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th in Figure 2). For each mode, the engaged<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms are listed and whether either or both of the<br>
motor/generators 20A and 20B are controlled to operate as motors (denoted as M) or<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
generators (denoted as G) is indicated. In each of these modes depicted in the chart,<br>
the engine 12 is also controlled by the controller 25 such that the crankshaft 18 rotates<br>
in a first direction, which may be clockwise. By controlling the engine 12 so that the<br>
crankshaft 18 rotates in a first direction, and by controlling the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms and the motor/generators as indicated, the resulting modes shown all<br>
result in the output member 16 rotating in a forward direction (i.e., a direction that<br>
corresponds with forward rotation of attached drive wheels).<br>
[0039]	For example, as electrically variable operating mode referred to in the<br>
chart as "Launch/EVT Mode 1" is provided by engaging torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 22, the brake CI, and operating the motor/generator 20A as a motor.<br>
[0040]	In the first mode of operation, and when the controller 25 has<br>
determined that the operator desires to move forward from a stationary condition, and<br>
to accelerate, the torque transfer device 22 is engaged to operatively connect the<br>
engine 12 to the electrically variable transmission 14, and torque transfer device 22<br>
remains applied as the vehicle moves forward through a speed range hereinafter more<br>
fully described. The torque transfer device C2 is not applied, and it remains<br>
disengaged. The torque transfer device CI is engaged. In this situation, the engine 12<br>
applies driving power to the ring gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24 so<br>
the ring gear member 30 rotates in unison with the input member 21 (and thus the<br>
engine 12). The first motor/generator 20A simultaneously rotates the sun gear<br>
member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 and the ring gear member 38 of the<br>
second planetary gear set 26 in the same direction, thus driving the carrier member 36<br>
in the same direction which effects rotation of the sun gear member 40 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26.<br>
[0041]	The second motor/generator 20B operates as a motor during the first<br>
mode, and as such motor/generator 20B drives sleeve shaft 66 in that direction which<br>
rotates the sun gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28 to rotate the planet<br>
gears 50 of the third planetary gear set 28 against the ring gear member 46 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. The ring gear member 46 is fixed by having been grounded so<br>
that the carrier member 52 drives the output member 16 in that direction required to<br>
effect forward movement of the vehicle.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
100421	That rotation of the sleeve shaft 66 effected by rotation of the second<br>
motor/generator 20B operating as a motor also rotates the sun gear member 40 of the<br>
second planetary gear set 26. Because the torque transfer device C2 remains<br>
disengaged, the carrier members 36 and 44 of the first and second planetary gear sets<br>
24 and 26, respectively, are freely rotatable-but only in unison inasmuch as the two<br>
carrier members 36 and 44 are compounded. As a result, the rotation of the ring gear<br>
member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24 effected by the engine 14 and the rotation<br>
of the sun gear member 40 effected by the second motor/generator 20B force the sun<br>
gear member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 and the conjoined ring gear member<br>
38 of the second planetary gear set 26 to drive the first motor/generator 20A in that<br>
direction, and velocity, which causes the first motor/generator 20A, at least initially,<br>
to serve as a generator.<br>
[0043]	Accordingly, in the first Launch/EVT Mode 1, a power path through<br>
the transmission 14 includes the input member 21, the ring gear member 30, sun gear<br>
member 32 (connected with motor/generator 20A operating as a generator), ring gear<br>
member 38, carrier member 36, sun gear member 40 (connected with motor/generator<br>
20B operating as a motor), sleeve shaft 66, sun gear member 48, planet gears 50, ring<br>
gear member 46, carrier member 52 and output member 16.<br>
[0044]	In the transmission 14, both fixed ratio modes and electrically variable<br>
modes are used to improve performance or efficiency. Starting in Launch/EVT Mode<br>
I, the first motor/generator 20A operates as a generator until approximately 7 MPH.<br>
At about 7 MPH, torque-transmitting mechanism C4, referred to as the lock-up clutch,<br>
is engaged while the brake CI remains engaged. In this configuration, the<br>
transmission 14 is engaged in the first fixed ratio as defined by the planetary gear set<br>
28, as illustrated in the table of Figure 2. When the clutch C4 is engaged, the first two<br>
gear sets 24, 26 and motor/generators 20A, 20B rotate at the input speed, and are<br>
connected with the sun gear member 48, and with the clutch CI also engaged there is<br>
a speed reduction provided by planetary gear set 28 and torque is multiplied. All<br>
power is transmitted mechanically through the planetary gear sets. With no torque<br>
present in the motors/generators 20A, 20B, there are no electrical losses, thus<br>
providing a higher efficiency operation, however, with full torque applied in<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
motor/generators 20A, 20B, a significant increase in performance can be realized.<br>
With both motors locked together by lock-up clutch C4, they also can share equally<br>
any regenerative power, thereby resulting in higher braking performance with<br>
improved cooling. Only the planetary gear set 28 is active because the lock-up clutch<br>
C4 locks up the planetary gear sets 24 and 26. Engagement of the torque transmitting<br>
device C4 also protects the motors/generators 20A, 20B if the power flow necessary<br>
for power split operation is more than the motors/generators 20A, 20B would tolerate.<br>
Therefore, if the vehicle is towing or hauling up a hill, then the motors/generators<br>
20A, 20B are protected.<br>
[0045]	In normal operation, only the clutch CI would be engaged at low<br>
speeds, but if maximum power is demanded, then the lock-up clutch C4 is also<br>
engaged. The motor/generators 20A, 20B may be turned on with the clutch C4 to<br>
achieve maximum available horsepower, and the motors/generators' 20A, 20B power<br>
may be reduced to reduce operating temperatures. The clutch C4 also provides the<br>
ability for the engine 12 and both motor/generators 20A, 20B, to all three<br>
simultaneously propel the vehicle for maximum acceleration.<br>
[0046]	Accordingly, in the first fixed ratio mode, a power path through the<br>
transmission 14 includes the input member 21, the planetary gear sets 24 and 26, all<br>
locked to rotate at the same speed, sun gear member 48, planet gears 50, carrier<br>
member 52 and output member 16.<br>
[0047]	At about 40 MPH, the lock-up clutch C4 is disengaged. Thereafter, the<br>
motor/generator 20B acts as a motor, and the motor/generator 20A acts as a generator<br>
up to a mechanical point wherein the motor/generator 20A is stationary. The<br>
motor/generator 20A then reverses direction and acts as a motor. The clutch C2 is<br>
then engaged at about 57 MPH. With the clutches CI and C2 engaged, a second fixed<br>
ratio is achieved. All three gear sets 24, 26, 28 are active. The motors/generators<br>
20A, 20B may be turned off during the engagement of the clutches CI and C2 for<br>
fully mechanical operation. During the second fixed ratio, the motors 20A, 20B may<br>
freewheel and no torque is present. At about 70 MPH, the clutch CI is disengaged and<br>
the clutch C2 remains engaged for the high-efficiency second mode of operation,<br>
EVTMode2.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
[0048]	The transition from the second fixed ratio to EVT Mode 2 of operation<br>
is achieved by disengaging torque-transmitting mechanism CI and continuing the<br>
application of torque transfer device C2. Similar to the previously described EVT<br>
Mode I overlap with fixed ratios, EVT Mode 2 overlaps fixed ratios in the truth table<br>
of FIG. 2, as determined by internal and engine speed limitations. At the inception of<br>
the EVT Mode 2 of operation, the first motor/generator 20A transitions from<br>
freewheeling or operating as a motor to operating as a generator, however this is<br>
influenced by the planetary gear ratio selections. The first motor/generator 20A<br>
continues to operate as a generator during operation of the transmission 14 in EVT<br>
Mode 2 while the vehicle gains speed from about 70 MPH to about 88 MPH. At about<br>
88 MPH the first motor/generator 20A transitions from operation as a generator back<br>
to operation as a motor as it transitions through a mechanical point wherein the<br>
motor/generator 20A has zero rotational speed. The first motor/generator 20A<br>
continues thereafter to operate as a motor.<br>
[0049]	At the beginning of the EVT Mode 2 of operation, the second<br>
motor/generator 20B continues to operate as a motor. In fact, the second<br>
motor/generator 20B operates as a motor until the vehicle reaches a speed of about 88<br>
MPH, at which point it transitions to operation as a generator, and continues thereafter<br>
to operate as a generator.<br>
[0050]	With the configuration of the transmission 14 heretofore described, and<br>
with the aforesaid number of teeth on the inner and outer gear members, the<br>
transmission 14 provides two mechanical points while operating in EVT Mode 2.<br>
That is, the first motor/generator 20A has a zero rotational speed at about 88 MPH. In<br>
addition, the second motor/generator 20B has a zero rotational speed at about 208<br>
MPH. Hence, the transmission 14 provides two mechanical points in EVT Mode 2<br>
operation.<br>
[0051]	As illustrated in the fixed ratio table of Figure 2, third and fourth fixed<br>
ratios are available. The third fixed ratio may be established with the simultaneous<br>
engagement of the clutches C2 and C4, which locks all gear sets into a 1:1 ratio so<br>
that the output member 16 rotates at the same speed as the input member 21. The<br>
fourth fixed ratio is established with the engagement of the clutches C2 and C3, as<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
illustrated in the fixed ratio table of Figure 2. In the fourth fixed ratio, the first and<br>
second planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are active, and the motors/generators 20A, 20B<br>
may freewheel with no torque present.<br>
[0052]	Accordingly, the transmission 14 provides three mechanical points and<br>
four available fixed ratios, thereby minimizing electrical losses in the<br>
motors/generators while providing maximum power quickly in EVT Model via the<br>
lock-up clutch C4. Exemplary numerical values for the first, second, third and fourth<br>
fixed ratio modes of 3.7, 1.7, 1.0 and 0.74 are achieved by utilizing ring gear<br>
members 30 and 38 in each of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26 that<br>
have 65 teeth, and sun gear members 32 and 40 in each of the first and second<br>
planetary gear sets 24 and 26 that have 33 teeth, a ring gear member 46 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 that has 94 teeth, and an sun gear member 48 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 that has 34 teeth.<br>
[0053]	Those skilled in the art will readily be able to determine the power<br>
flow paths through the transmission 14 established during the second, third and fourth<br>
fixed ratio modes.<br>
[0054]	If the engine 12 was not controllable to cause the crankshaft 18 to<br>
rotate in a second, e.g., counterclockwise direction, then a reverse mode could be<br>
provided by having the controller 25 operate the second motor/generator 20B as a<br>
motor, but reversing its rotational direction from the direction in which the second<br>
motor/generator 20B rotates for launch in the first mode electrically variable mode of<br>
operation, EVT Mode 1.<br>
[0055]	As discussed above, relying on the second motor/generator 20B to<br>
carry out a reverse mode limits the reverse operation to available battery power and<br>
motor torque. Accordingly, instead, various methods of controlling the engine 12 so<br>
that the crankshaft 18 is rotatable in a second direction allows the same modes of<br>
operation listed in Figure 2 to be achieved, using the same power flow paths, with the<br>
same clutches, components and motor/generators operating in the same manner,<br>
although rotating in opposite directions, so that the output member 16 rotates in a<br>
reverse direction.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
[0056]	Referring to Figure 3, a portion of the powertrain 10 shows a more<br>
detailed view of one embodiment of the engine 12. The engine 12 includes an engine<br>
block 70 having cylinders 72 formed or otherwise provided therein. An intake valve<br>
73 and an exhaust valve 74 are operatively connected to each of the cylinders 72 and<br>
are openable and closeable for allowing combustion of gas within the cylinders 72 to<br>
cause rotation of the crankshaft 18. Those skilled in the art readily understand the<br>
introduction of intake air through a throttle 75 and intake passages (not shown) into<br>
fluid communication with the intake valve 73. Additionally, fuel is fed to the cylinder<br>
72 via an electric fuel feed pump (not shown). Fuel in the cylinders is ignited to<br>
combust, driving pistons within the cylinders that are operatively connected to the<br>
crankshaft 18, thereby rotating the engine crankshaft 18, as is understood by those<br>
skilled in the art. The exhaust valves 74 open to allow exhausting of the combusted<br>
gases through exhaust passage 69. Sensors in signal communication with the<br>
controller 25 may be provided in the intake ports to the valves and in the exhaust air<br>
flow so that the controller 25 can regulate the air fuel mixture and the engine 12.<br>
[0057]	A first overhead camshaft 76 is operatively connected with the intake<br>
valves 73 via cam lobes, and rotates to cause reciprocal opening and closing of the<br>
intake valves 73. Similarly, a second overhead camshaft 77 is operatively connected<br>
with the exhaust valves 74 and is provided with cam lobes and rotates to reciprocally<br>
open and close the exhaust valve 74. A high authority electrically-actuated intake<br>
cam phaser 78A is operatively connected to the overhead camshaft 76 to control the<br>
phasing of the camshaft 76 with respect to the crankshaft 18. Similarly, a high<br>
authority electrically-actuated exhaust cam phaser 78B is operatively connected with<br>
the second overhead camshaft 77 to control phasing of the camshaft 77 relative to the<br>
crankshaft 18. Each of the cam phasers 78A and 78B are "high authority", which is<br>
defined herein to mean having a phasing authority of not less than 180 degrees crank<br>
angle; 90 degrees cam angle. Phasing authority is the range of rotation of the<br>
camshaft controllable by the cam phaser. The cam phasers 78A and 78B are<br>
operatively connected to the controller 25. An input request signal 79 to the<br>
controller 25 is processed by the controller 25 to determine the desired phasing of the<br>
intake valves 73 and exhaust valves 74 relative to the crankshaft 18. The input<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
request signal 79 (i.e., an input signal) may be provided by sensor and actuator signals<br>
responding to an operator request for driving torque in a forward direction or a reverse<br>
direction, such as by manipulation of an accelerator pedal or a manual gear shift<br>
device With the high authority phasing available through the phasers 78A, 78B, the<br>
controller 25 can process a first predetermined phasing of the intake and exhaust cam<br>
phasers 78A and 78B if the input request signal 79 is for rotation of a transmission<br>
output member 16 of Figure 1 in a forward driving direction. This causes the<br>
crankshaft 18 to rotate in a first direction (represented as a clockwise direction) as<br>
indicated by the arrow in Figure 3. Alternatively, if the input request signal 79 is for<br>
rotation of the output member 16 in a reverse direction, the controller 25 can send the<br>
respective control signals 80A, 80B to the phasers 78A and 78B to cause a second<br>
predetermined phasing of the camshafts 76 and 77 such that the intake and exhaust<br>
valves 73 and 74 are lifted according to the second predetermined phasing. This<br>
causes the crankshaft 18 to rotate in a second direction (e.g., a counterclockwise<br>
direction). Regardless of the direction of rotation of the crankshaft 18, the electrically<br>
variable transmission 14 connected thereto (shown in Figure 1) may be controlled to<br>
achieve the same modes depicted in Figure 2 whether the crankshaft rotates in the first<br>
direction or in the second direction.<br>
[0058]	One example of an electrically-actuated cam phaser includes an<br>
electric-motor driven worm gear actuator that varies the phasing of a camshaft relative<br>
to a crankshaft through a planetary gear set. The worm gear actuator includes a worm<br>
gear rotatably driven by a worm that is driven by the electric motor. The planetary<br>
gear set includes a sun gear member connected for rotation with the worm gear, a<br>
carrier member connected for rotation with the camshaft and a ring gear member<br>
operatively connected to the crankshaft through a drive sprocket carried on the<br>
crankshaft, a driven sprocket carried on the ring gear member, and chain connecting<br>
the sprockets. The worm gear is connected with an actuator shaft to the sun gear to<br>
provide a driving connection between the worm gear and the sun gear member. In<br>
order to change the phase relation of the camshaft with respect to the crankshaft while<br>
the engine is operating, the electric motor is rotated in a desired direction by<br>
energizing the motor from an external controller. Rotation of the motor rotates the<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
worm, causing the worm gear to oscillate about its axis and thereby reposition or<br>
change the rotational position of the sun gear member in the planetary gear set. This<br>
change causes relative rotation of the planet carrier member within the driven<br>
sprocket, thereby rotating the camshaft and changing its phase with respect to the<br>
driven sprocket and the directly connected crankshaft. The motor may be driven in<br>
forward or reverse directions to either advance or retard the camshaft phase angle and<br>
control the actuation of associated engine valves with respect to the timing of the<br>
crankshaft as desired.<br>
[0059]	Figure 4A illustrates valve lift profile when the input request signal 79<br>
is for torque at the output member 16 in a forward driving direction, as provided by<br>
the phasing of the high authority intake cam phases 78A, 78B of Figure 3. As<br>
crankshaft 18 crank angle and time increase moving from left to right (i.e., as pistons<br>
within the cylinders 72 move from bottom dead center to top dead center to bottom<br>
dead center positions), the valve lift profile 82A of a given exhaust valve 74 lifts and<br>
lowers prior to the valve lift profile 82B of the corresponding intake valve 73 (i.e., the<br>
intake valve 73 operatively connected with the same cylinder 72 as the given exhaust<br>
valve 74).<br>
[0060]	Figure 4B illustrates valve lift of the valves 73 and 74 according to the<br>
phasing of the cam phasers 78A and 78B under control of the controller 25 when the<br>
input request signal 79 is for torque at the output member 16 in a reverse driving<br>
direction. In reverse operation with crank angle and time increasing moving from<br>
right to left, the valve lift profile 82C of a given exhaust valve 74 precedes the valve<br>
lift profile 82D of a corresponding intake valve 73.<br>
[0061]	Referring to Figure 5, an engine 112 that may be used in place of<br>
engine 12 in the powertrain 10 of Figure 1 is depicted. The engine 112 has a<br>
fully-flexible, camless valve actuation system. An engine block 170 is formed or<br>
otherwise provided with cylinders 172. Intake valves 173 and exhaust valves 174 are<br>
openable and closeable to allow combustion of gas within the cylinders 172, as is<br>
understood by those skilled in the art. (The intake valves 173 and exhaust valves 174<br>
are partially obscured by respective intake valves actuators 183A operatively<br>
connected to each of the intake valves 173 and exhaust valve actuators 183B<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
operatively connected to each of the exhaust valves 174.) The controller 125 responds<br>
to an input request signal 179 for driving torque of the output member 16 of Figure 1<br>
in either a forward driving direction or a reverse driving direction. In accordance with<br>
the input request signal 179, the controller 125 sends control signals 180A and 180B<br>
to each of the intake valve actuators 183A and exhaust valve actuators 183B. The<br>
actuators 183 A and 183B may be of the electro-hydraulic or electro-magnetic variety<br>
or any other variety able to respond to an electrical control signal, such as control<br>
signals 180A and 180B, to vary the opening and closing of the intake valves 173 and<br>
exhaust valves 174, respectively. An electro-hydraulic camless valve actuation<br>
system may employ a manifold housing high pressure oil. The body of the manifold<br>
may have channels formed lengthwise therein, with switching valves on the body<br>
operative to alternately communicate oil in the channels with cylinder valves (i.e.,<br>
intake and exhaust valves) of an engine to which the manifold is mounted to affect<br>
movement of the cylinder valves. An electro-magnetic camless valve actuation<br>
system would rely on electric current in a magnetic field producing motion to open<br>
and close valves that affect opening and closing of the cylinder valves.<br>
[0062]	Because the actuators 183A, 183B are not dependent upon a rotating<br>
camshaft to provide opening and closing of the valves 173, 174, they are "fully<br>
flexible". Thus, the controller 125 can control the actuators 183A and 183B to cause<br>
rotation of the crankshaft 118 in the first direction, as indicated by the arrow shown,<br>
corresponding with a forward direction of the rotation for the output member 16 of<br>
Figure 1 or in a second direction (counterclockwise), corresponding with rotation of<br>
the output member 16 in a reverse direction.<br>
[0063]	Referring to Figure 6A, an alternative engine 212 and controller 225<br>
that may be used in the powertrain of Figure 1 is depicted. The engine 212 has an<br>
engine block 270 formed or otherwise provided with cylinders 272. An intake valve<br>
273 and an exhaust valve 274 correspond with each cylinder 272. Multiple cam lobes<br>
290A, 290B are operatively connectable to each of the intake valves 273 and exhaust<br>
valves 274. The multiple cam lobes 290A, 290B are supported on camshafts 276 and<br>
277 and are better viewed in Fig. 6B. In Figure 6B, one set of multiple cam lobes<br>
290A, 290B is shown connected for rotation with the camshaft 276 and in operative<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
connection with one of the intake valve 273. It should be understood, that other like<br>
cam lobes 290A, 290B are in operative communication with each of the exhaust<br>
valves 274, as well. As shown in Figure 6B, cam lobe 290A is a reverse cam lobe and<br>
is generally 180 degrees crank angle; 90 degrees cam angle out of phase with the<br>
forward cam lobe 290B (with a dashed line indicating the outermost tip of the lobe<br>
nose extending in a forward direction). A cam switching mechanism 292 is<br>
hydraulically or electrically controllable by the controller 225 to switch between the<br>
reverse cam lobe 290A and the forward cam lobe 290B to control which cam lobe<br>
operatively communicates and controls lifting of the valve 273. The cam switching<br>
mechanism 292 includes a reverse roller finger follower 293A and a forward roller<br>
finger follower 293B both of which are pivotable about a pivot shaft 294 on which a<br>
rocker arm 295 operatively connected to the valve 273 also pivots. Switching lock<br>
pin 296 is controllable to alternatively lock the reverse roller finger follower 293A for<br>
common motion with the rocker arm 295 or the forward roller finger follower 293B<br>
for common motion with the rocker arm 295. The roller finger follower 293A or<br>
293B that is not locked to the rocker arm 295 by the switching lock pin 296 pivots in<br>
lost motion about the pivot shaft with respect to the rocker arm 295. Thus, the<br>
position of the switching lock pin 296 controls which of the cam lobe 290A, 290B<br>
will operatively communicate with the valve 273, controlling lifting and lowering<br>
thereof.<br>
[0064]	The controller 225 responds to an input request signal 279 for driving<br>
torque of the output member 16 of Figure 1 in either a forward or reverse driving<br>
direction. In accordance with the input request signal 279, the controller 225 sends<br>
control signals 280A and 280B to each of the switching lock pins 296 disposed at<br>
each of the valves 273 and 274. Thus, the controller 225 can control the cam<br>
switching mechanisms 292 to cause rotation of the crankshaft 218 in the first<br>
direction, as indicated by the clockwise arrow shown, corresponding with a forward<br>
direction of rotation for the output member 16 of Fig. 1, or in a second direction (i.e.,<br>
counterclockwise), corresponding with rotation of the output member 16 in a reverse<br>
driving direction.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
20<br>
[0065]	Referring to Figures 7A and 7B, an engine 312 may be used in place of<br>
engine 12 in the powertrain 10 in Figure 1. The engine 312 includes an engine block<br>
370 that is formed or otherwise provided with cylinders 372. Intake valves 373 and<br>
exhaust valves 374 are openable and closeable to allow combustion of gas within the<br>
cylinders 372, as is understood by those skilled in the art. (The intake valves 373 and<br>
374 are partially obscured by respective three dimensional cams on respective intake<br>
valve overhead cam shaft 376 and exhaust valve overhead camshaft 377.)<br>
[0066]	Each of the camshafts 376 and 377 are formed with three dimensional<br>
cam lobes 390 that include a reverse cam profile 3 90A and a forward cam profile<br>
390B ninety degrees (cam angle) out of phase with the reverse cam profile 390A, with<br>
a transitioning portion 390C therebetween. In Figure 7B, the cam lobes 390 are<br>
illustrated with respect to the overhead camshaft 376. A dashed line indicates the<br>
outermost tip of the lobe nose on forward cam profile 390B and connects to the<br>
outermost tip of the lobe nose on the reverse cam profile 390A. It should be<br>
understood that a like three-dimensional cam lobe 390 is positioned for operative<br>
engagement with each of the valves 373, 374.<br>
[0067]	Referring again to Figure 7A, actuators 383A and 383B serve as an<br>
intake cam axially-positioning actuator and an exhaust cam axially-positioning<br>
actuator, respectively. The actuators 383A and 383B are translatable to move the<br>
respective camshafts 376, 377 axially (i.e., along the axis of rotation of the camshaft).<br>
Specifically, a controller 325 responds to an input request signal 379 for driving<br>
torque of the output member 16 of Figure 1 in either a forward driving direction or a<br>
reverse driving direction. In accordance with the input request signal 379, the<br>
controller 325 sends control signals 380A and 380 B to each of the actuators 383A,<br>
383B, respectively. The actuators 383A, 383B respond to the control signals 380A,<br>
380B to translate the respective camshafts 376 and 377 with respect to the intake<br>
valves 373 and exhaust valves 374 to determine which of the reverse cam profile<br>
390A or forward cam profile 390B will be in operative engagement with and<br>
controlling lifting of the respective valves 373 and 374. If a forward driving torque is<br>
desired, the controller 325 will cause actuation of the actuator 3 83A such that the<br>
forward cam profiles 390B are in operative engagement with the intake valve 373.<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
21<br>
Likewise, the controller 325 will control the actuator 383B such that the reverse cam<br>
profiles 390A are in operative engagement with the exhaust valves 374. Under these<br>
conditions, the crankshaft 318 will rotate in a first direction, indicated by the arrow<br>
shown in Figure 7A, corresponding with a forward driving direction of the output<br>
member 16 of Figure 1.<br>
[0068]	If, instead, a reverse driving torque is desired, the controller 325 will<br>
control the actuators 383A and 383B to translate the respective camshafts 376 and<br>
377 such that the reverse cam profiles 390A are in operative engagement with the<br>
intake valves 373 and the forward cam profiles 390B are in operative engagement<br>
with the exhaust valves 374. Under these conditions, the crankshaft 318 rotates in a<br>
second direction (i.e., a counterclockwise direction), corresponding with a reverse<br>
driving direction for the output member 16 of Figure 1. A transitioning section 390C<br>
of each three dimensional cam 390 allows a smooth transition from an operative<br>
engagement of a valve 373 or 374 with one of the cam profiles 390A and 390B to the<br>
other.<br>
[0069]	Referring to Figure 8, a crankshaft driven pump 401 is depicted,<br>
showing pump gears 402A, 402B rotating in a direction corresponding with rotation<br>
of an engine crankshaft in a first direction of rotation that corresponds with a forward<br>
driving direction of the vehicle, as described above for any of the engines 12, 112,<br>
212 312. A direction of input lubrication fluid flow from an oil sump pickup tube in<br>
an input channel 403A is depicted as well as the corresponding direction of output<br>
flow of pressurized lubrication fluid to engine bearings, and torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms through an exhaust channel 403B is depicted. A reversing valve 404 in<br>
fluid communication with the input channel 403A and the exhaust channel 403B is<br>
shown in a forward operation position, with first and second channel portions 405A<br>
and 405B aligned to allow fluid flow as depicted by the solid arrows.<br>
[0070]	If the engine is controlled such that the crankshaft rotates in an<br>
opposing direction corresponding with a reverse driving torque at the output member<br>
of an electrically variable transmission, as described with respect to any of the<br>
embodiments above, the pump gears 402A and 402B will rotate in an opposite<br>
direction (shown in phantom) due to rotation in a second direction of the crankshaft to<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
22<br>
which they are connected. Under these conditions, the reversing valve 404, which is<br>
preferably a rotary type solenoid- actuated reversing valve, is controlled by a<br>
controller (any of the controllers described in any of the embodiments above) to move<br>
to a reverse operation position, depicted as 404A in Figure 8 in which channel<br>
portions 405A and 405B are indicated as 405AA and 405BB in their rotated positions.<br>
In the reverse operation position, the first and second channel portions are rotated<br>
ninety degrees clockwise such that fluid flow from the oil sump is directed through<br>
channel portion 405AA, to channel 403B to the crankshaft driven pump 401, in an<br>
opposing flow direction to that in forward operation, as illustrated by the dashed<br>
arrows. Thus, the channel 403B serves to provide intake flow to the pump 401 during<br>
reverse operation of the engine. Second channel portion 405BB of the reversing valve<br>
404 is in a position to cause exhaust fluid flow from the pump 401 in channel 403 A to<br>
route to the engine bearings and torque-transmitting mechanisms through supply<br>
channel 403C. Thus, the reversing valve 404 is controllable to move between forward<br>
operation and reverse operation positions to ensure that flow through the channel<br>
403C to the engine is a predetermined amount (i.e., volume) and direction of fluid<br>
flow regardless of the direction of rotation of the pump 401 (and, therefore, regardless<br>
of the direction of rotation of the engine crankshaft connected to the pump).<br>
[0071]	Referring to Figure 9, engine driven auxiliary or accessory devices<br>
501 A, 50IB and 501C are shown operatively connected to an engine crankshaft 518<br>
via an endless rotatable device 506, such as a belt or chain. The crankshaft 518 may<br>
be operatively connected to any of the engines 12, 112, 212, 312, described above<br>
such that the crankshaft 518 may rotate in first and second directions corresponding<br>
with forward and reverse drive at the output member 16 of the electrically variable<br>
transmission 14. It should be appreciated that the accessories 501A-C may also be<br>
driven off of the transmission input member 21 of Figure 1. Preferably, the engine<br>
accessory 501A is a high pressure direct fuel injection pump, engine accessory 50IB<br>
is an air conditioning compressor, and engine accessory 501C is a power steering<br>
pump. If the accessories 501A-C are not of the dual-drive type (i.e., are not<br>
configured to be driven by their own internal electric motor as an alternative to the<br>
crankshaft driven mode), a reversing device 507 operatively connected to a controller<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
23<br>
525 may be actuated to reverse the direction of rotation of the belt 506 relative to the<br>
crankshaft 518 when the crankshaft 518 rotates in a second direction of rotation<br>
corresponding with reverse driving torque at the transmission output member 16.<br>
Alternatively, if the engine driven accessories 501A-501C are not of the dual-drive<br>
type, a separate accessory drive motor 508 may be controlled by the controller 525 to<br>
power the accessories 501A-501C when the crankshaft 518 rotates in the second<br>
direction, corresponding with the reverse driving torque of the output member and<br>
reversing device 507 in a neutral condition. An engine harmonic damper 509 may be<br>
utilized to absorb engine vibrations, preventing transmission of the vibrations to the<br>
accessories 501A-501C.<br>
[0072]	Referring to Fig. 10, a crankshaft 618 of an engine 612 drives<br>
accessories 601 A, 60IB. (The crankshaft 618 is visible only at one end of the engine<br>
612 but extends to drive the accessories 601A, 601B via gears 608A, 608B,<br>
respectively driven by the crankshaft 618 to rotate commonly with the accessories<br>
601 A, 60IB). When the crankshaft 618 rotates in a first direction, corresponding with<br>
rotation of an output member operatively connected to an EVT engine (not shown),<br>
the gears rotate in respective predetermined directions. However, when the<br>
crankshaft 618 is controlled to rotate in a second direction, corresponding with a<br>
reverse driving torque at an output member of the attached EVT transmission 614, a<br>
reverse gear 608C is actuated via a control signal 680 sent from a controller 625 to<br>
engage with the gears 608A and 608B such that they continue to rotate in the<br>
predetermined direction in which they rotated when the crankshaft rotated in the first<br>
direction, such that the change in direction of the rotation of the crankshaft 618 will<br>
not affect the driving rotation of the accessories 601A and 60 IB.<br>
[0073]	Accordingly, each of the embodiments described above are<br>
controllable such that an engine crankshaft rotates in two directions, allowing a<br>
transmission output member of an attached electrically variable transmission to rotate<br>
in both a forward driving torque direction and a reverse driving torque direction,<br>
while allowing power flow paths through the electrically variable transmission to<br>
remain identical in forward and reverse operation, and without requiring a reverse<br><br>
GP-308284-PTH-CD<br>
24<br>
gear or the use of either of the motor/generators to control the output member to rotate<br>
in a reverse direction.<br>
[0074]	A method of controlling a powertrain is accomplished by any of the<br>
engines described above when attached to an electrically variable transmission. The<br>
method will be specifically described with respect to the powertrain 10 of Figure 1<br>
with engine 12 as specifically shown in Figure 3. The method includes receiving a<br>
request for rotation of the output member 16 in one of the forward direction and a<br>
reverse direction. The request is received via the input request signal 79 to the<br>
controller 25. The method then includes lifting the intake and exhaust valves 73, 74,<br>
respectively, according to a first predetermined phasing with respect to rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 18, thereby causing the crankshaft 18 to rotate in a first direction that<br>
corresponds with rotation of the transmission output member 16 in the forward<br>
direction, assuming the received input request signal 79 for rotation of the output<br>
member 16 is in the forward direction. Alternatively, assuming that the received<br>
input request signal 79 is for rotation of the output member 16 in the reverse driving<br>
direction, the method includes lifting the intake and exhaust valves 73, 74,<br>
respectively, according to a second predetermined phasing with respect to rotation of<br>
the crankshaft 18. The second predetermined phasing substantially opposes the first<br>
predetermined phasing (as shown if Fig. 4A, 4B), and causes the crankshaft 18 to<br>
rotate in a second direction that corresponds with rotation of the output member 16 in<br>
the reverse direction. Power flow paths through the transmission 14 are the same<br>
whether the valves are lifted according to the first predetermined phasing or the<br>
second predetermined phasing. That is, the modes of operation shown in Fig. 2 are<br>
utilized to provide both forward driving torque or reverse driving torque.<br>
[0075]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
