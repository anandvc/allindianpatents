				<td>PROCESS OF EXTRACTING CITRUS FIBER FROM CITRUS VESICLES<br>
FffiLD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to citrus fiber extracted from citrus vesicles. 5     The resulting dried citrus fiber is useful as a food additive for beverages, baked goods, meat or meat emulsions, confectionary, jams and jellies, dairy products, dressings, energy bars, and the like.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Current processes for making citrus juice employ extractors for separating the<br>
  juice-containing inner part of the fruit from its outer peel. The juice extracted by the<br>
extractors contains the juice itself as well as a pectinaceous and cellulosic material<br>
called citrus vesicles.   This material sometimes is also referred to as coarse pulp,<br>
floaters, citrus cells, floating pulp, juice sacs, or pulp.<br>
Citrus vesicles typically are separated from the juice by means of filtration,<br>
   using equipment such as paddle finishers, screw finishers and turbo filters. The citrus<br>
vesicles contain a significant amount of juice-soluble solids.  For economic reasons,<br>
the citrus vesicles often are subjected to a water washing step, e.g., using blenders,<br>
screw mixers, inline static mixers, finishers, or turbo filters. The water washing step<br>
produces a stream of secondary grade juice, referred to as water extracted soluble<br>
   orange solids (WESOS) or simply "pulp wash."   The washed cells, also called<br>
"washed pulp," are considered waste from this step. Typically, the washed cells are<br>
mixed with the peel (from the extraction process mentioned above), further processed<br>
(for example treated with lime to assist in dewatering) and dried for use as cattle feed.<br><br>
Some efforts have been made to recover potentially valuable components from citrus waste. For example, U.S. Patent 6,183,806 Bl to Ficca et al. describes citrus peel extracts and flour prepared from the extracts. Citrus peel is extracted with an ethanol solvent and the solid residue is desolventized to recover orange flour. The 5 citrus peel is provided in comminuted pieces or particles. The comminuted pieces or particles may be provided in the form of washed pulp (pomace). Ficca uses the term "washed pulp" somewhat unconventionally to refer to pomace, a component of the peel. Ficca indicates that the orange flour extracted from pomace is similar in composition to the flour obtained from orange peel.<br>
	Washed citrus cells contain citrus fiber, a valuable citrus component which has<br>
relatively high total dietary fiber content and a balanced ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber. The balanced dietary fiber spectrum of insoluble (chiefly cellulose) and soluble (chiefly pectin) fiber is advantageous in physiological functionality over cereal-based fibers. Citrus fiber, particularly orange pulp fiber, has an extremely high<br>
 water binding capacity, resulting in high viscosities compared to other citrus fibers such as Vitacel orange fiber (available from Rettenmaier).<br>
It would be desirable to develop a process for recovering citrus fiber from citrus vesicles, especially a process which can recover citrus fiber in an efficient and relatively cost effective manner. It would be especially desirable to develop a process 20 which can recover citrus fiber without the need for using potentially hazardous agents. It would be particularly desirable to develop a process which provides citrus fiber that can be used as a food and beverage ingredient.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, according to one aspect, is directed to a process of purifying citrus fiber in citrus vesicles to obtain a food additive suitable for human consumption. The process comprises an optional step of washing citrus vesicles with 5 water to remove unwanted flavors, odors, colors, sugars, acids and the like. The vesicles are contacted with an organic solvent to obtain organic solvent washed vesicles. The organic solvent washed vesicles are desolventized and dried citrus fiber is recovered therefrom.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the extraction process employs<br>
     an ethanol solvent and a solids-to-solvent weight ratio of at least about 0.25:1,<br>
preferably at least about 0.5:1.  The solvent extraction is carried out in at least two<br>
counter current stages. At least a portion of the solvent, preferably at least about 70%,<br>
is recovered and reused.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, dried citrus fiber is prepared by the<br>
    extraction process as described above.   The dried citrus fiber is useful as a food<br>
additive for such food products as beverages, baked goods, meat or meat emulsions,<br>
confectionary, jams and jellies, dairy products such as yogurt, dressings, energy bars,<br>
and the like.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a citrus fiber has a total dietary fiber 20     content of from about 60 to about 85 wt% and a water binding capacity from about 9 to about 25 (w/w).<br>
In one embodiment, dried citrus fiber has a total dietary fiber content of from about 60 to about 80 wt% and a water binding capacity from about 7 to about 12<br><br>
(w/w). Preferably the total dietary fiber content is at least about 70 wt% and the water binding capacity is at least about 8 (w/w).<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The objects, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from 5     the following more detailed description of certain embodiments of the invention and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a two-stage countercurrent solvent extraction process in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be described primarily with reference to extracting orange fiber from orange vesicles. It should be understood that the process may be used for extracting citrus fiber from citrus vesicles from a wide variety of other types of citras fruit, non-limiting examples of which include tangerines, limes, lemons, and 15 grapefruit. The citrus vesicles typically have a water content of at least about 80 wt% and usually from about 90 to about 97 wt%.<br>
The term "citrus vesicles," as used herein, refers to the pectinaceous and cellulosic material contained in the inner, juice-containing portion of citrus fruit. Citrus vesicles are sometimes also referred to as coarse pulp, floaters, citrus cells, 20     floating pulp, juice sacs, or pulp.<br>
The term "water extracted soluble solids," as used herein, refers to secondary grade juice which is obtained by water-washing citrus vesicles.   The term "water<br><br>
extracted soluble solids" is particularly inclusive of water extracted soluble orange solids (WESOS). Water extracted soluble solids are sometimes also referred to as "pulp wash."<br>
The term "water washed vesicles" refers to citrus vesicles from which water 5     extracted soluble solids have been removed by washing with water.  Water washed vesicles are also sometimes referred to as "washed cells" or "washed pulp."<br>
The terra "citrus fiber," as used herein, refers to a fibrous component obtained<br>
from water washed vesicles and isolated from waste components present therein.<br>
Citrus fiber is characterized by a high total dietary fiber content as well as a balanced<br>
   ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber. Citrus fiber, particularly orange fiber, has a<br>
very high water binding capacity.<br>
Citrus fiber, as compared to citrus flour obtained from citrus peel, is lighter in color and relatively free of taste and odor. In contrast, citrus flour obtained from citrus peel is characterized by an orange peel taste, odor and color, which severely 15 limit the product's uses. Additional advantages of citrus fiber include a higher total dietary fiber content (e.g., greater than about 70% versus 58%); lower carbohydrate content (e.g., about 5% versus 15%); and higher water binding capacity (e.g., greater than about 8 grams of water per gram of fiber versus 5.5 g/g). The protein content of the citrus fiber typically ranges from about 8 to 12 wt%.<br>
	The ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber is an important factor in the<br>
citrus fiber's functionality. Preferably, the citrus fiber has a balanced ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber. For example, the total dietary fiber preferably is made up of about 45-50% soluble dietary fiber and from 50-55% insoluble dietary fiber. Other important considerations include the degree of milling (granulometry) and drying<br><br>
conditions (process of drying). Generally, a higher degree of milling (i.e., a finer fiber granulometry) results in more smoothness of mouthfeel of the fiber in foods and beverages. Density and particle size may vary over a wide range depending on processing conditions. Byway of example, density may range from about 80 to about 5 650 g/L, and average particle size may range from about 15 to about 600 microns. It should be understood that these ranges are merely exemplary. In some applications it may be desirable to employ significantly larger particle sizes, for example. In general, the citrus fiber may range from a very fine to a coarse powder structure.<br>
As shown schematically in Fig. 1, orange vesicles can be separated from<br>
     orange juice by filtration, e.g., using conventional filtration equipment 10 such as<br>
paddle finishers, screw finishers or turbo filters.   The orange vesicles then can be<br>
subjected to an optional water washing step using suitable equipment 20 such as<br>
blenders, inline static mixers, finishers, or turbo filters. Water washing is desirable to<br>
eliminate undesirable flavors, odors, and acids present in the citrus vesicles.   The<br>
     water washing step 20 produces a stream of water extracted soluble orange solids<br>
(WESOS). The water extracted soluble orange solids, together with the juice obtained<br>
by filtration 10, can be further processed using conventional juicing equipment 15.<br>
An organic solvent is used to extract flavors, odors, colors and the like from the water washed vesicles. The solvent should be polar and water-miscible to 20 facilitate removal of the desired components. Preferred solvents include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or butanol. The solvent may be (and preferably is) provided in aqueous solution. The concentration of solvent in the solvent solution most often ranges from about 70 wt% to about 100 wt%. In one embodiment, a 75 wt% aqueous ethanol solution is used as solvent. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, a 90 wt% aqueous ethanol solution is used as solvent. In general, solvents will remove water-soluble components at lower concentrations and oil-soluble components at higher concentrations. Optionally, a more non-polar co-solvent may be added to the aqueous alcohol to improve the recovery of oil-soluble 5 components in the citrus vesicles. Examples of such non-polar solvents include ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, hexane, methyl isobutyl ketone and toluene. The more non-polar solvents may be added at up to 20% of the solvent mixture. Many solvents, such as ethanol, have a lower heat of vaporization than that of water, and therefore require less energy to volatilize than would be needed to volatilize an 10 equivalent mass of water. The solvent preferably is removed and reclaimed for reuse.<br>
Preferably, the water washed vesicles are contacted with organic solvent at a<br>
solids-to-solvent weight ratio of at least about 0.25:1, preferably at least about 0.5:1,<br>
and often at least about 0.75:1, from about 1:1 to about 5:1, or from about 1.5:1 to<br>
about 3:1, based on the wet weight of the solids.  In one embodiment, the solids-to-<br>
    solvent ratio is about 2:1.<br>
Extraction can be accomplished using a single stage but preferably is ' performed using multi-stage extraction, e.g., a two-, three-, or four-staged extraction process, and preferably using countercurrent extraction. There is no particular upper limit contemplated on the number of extraction stages that may be used. Fig. 1 20 schematically illustrates a preferred embodiment in which a two-stage countercurrent extraction process employs first and second solvent extractors 25a and 25b, respectively.<br>
Water washed vesicles are fed into the second extractor 25b.   An aqueous ethanol solvent is fed from a solvent tank 26 into the first solvent extractor 25a. Spent<br><br>
solvent from the first solvent extractor 25a is fed into the second solvent extractor 25b, while the extracted citrus vesicles from the second solvent extractor 25b are fed into the first solvent extractor 25a. Spent solvent from the second solvent extractor 25b may be fed into an evaporator 35 (optional) to separate solids (e.g., sugars, colors, 5 flavors, citrus oils, etc.) from the spent solvent, which can be condensed and returned to a still 24. Still bottoms (predominately water) are separated and removed.<br>
After each extraction stage, a belt filter press (not shown) preferably is used to<br>
further remove liquids. A belt filter press may be of conventional construction which<br>
is known to persons skilled in the art. Details of suitable belt filter presses are found,<br>
     for example, in U.S. Patents 4,236,445, 4,297,215, and 5,022,989, the disclosures of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Solvent washed vesicles from the first solvent extractor 25a are fed to a desolventizer 30. .The desolventizer 30 removes solvent and water from the solids remaining after extraction, enabling the solvent to be reclaimed for future use and also<br>
ensuring that the product is safe for milling and commercial use. The desolventizer 30 can employ indirect heat to remove significant amounts of solvent from the solid residue. Alternatively, direct heat can be provided for drying, e.g., by providing hot air from flash dryers or fluidized bed dryers. Direct steam may be employed, if desired, to remove any trace amounts of solvent remaining in the solids. Vapors from<br>
the desolventizer 30 preferably are recovered and fed to the still 24 to reclaim at least a portion of the solvent.<br>
Retention time in each extraction step may vary over a wide range but usually is about 5 minutes or less and preferably is about 3 minutes or less. The temperature in the solvent extractors) depends on such factors as the type of solvent used but<br><br>
most often ranges from about 40°F to about 180°F at atmospheric pressure. Temperatures can be appropriately increased or decreased for operation under super-or sub-atmospheric pressures. Optionally, techniques such as ultra-sound are used for enhancing efficiency of the extraction process. By maintaining a closed system, 5 solvent losses during extraction, desolventizing, and distillation can be minimized. Preferably, at least about 70 wt% of the solvent is recovered and reused. A solvent make-up stream delivers fresh solvent into the solvent tank 26 to replenish any solvent that is not recovered.<br>
The dried orange fiber product is generally a coarse flour. The flour can be 10 milled if a powder is needed for a particular application. Optionally, the citrus fiber is subjected to one or more additional treatments needed or desired for a particular end use. For example, natural enzymes may be inactivated prior to the solvent extraction process or drying. Enzymes may be inactivated, e.g., by ultrasound or by conventional thermal inactivation.<br>
	Unlike many typical commercial fibers, the orange fiber of the present<br>
invention has thickening power, creates pulpy textures (coarse fraction) and has good stability. For example, the citrus fiber can be used for 1% sucrose replacement in a standard bakery cream recipe with improved baking stability and good freeze/ thaw stability. This indicates an extremely high water binding capacity of the orange fiber,<br>
    resulting in relatively high viscosities.<br>
The high water binding capacity can be beneficial for many applications (e.g., processed meat applications). In other applications, such as in bakery products, a high water binding capacity may not be desirable. Extremely fine milled fibers (e.g., 20 to<br><br>
30 um particle size) generally will show superior sensory characteristics (high smoothness).<br>
In addition to having utility as a food additive in beverages, baked goods, meat or meat emulsions (e.g., sausage, bologna, hot dogs), confectionary, jams and jellies, dairy products, dressings, energy bars, and the like, the citrus fiber also potentially can be used as a natural thickening agent for food products, such as yogurt, or as a carrier for other components in beverage systems. Suitable amounts of citrus fiber for the various food products can be determined by persons skilled in the art in accordance with such factors as user preferences and with the aid of no more than routine experimentation.<br>
