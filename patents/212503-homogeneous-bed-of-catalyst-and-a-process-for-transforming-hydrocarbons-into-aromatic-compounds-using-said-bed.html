The present invention relates to a homogeneous bed of catalyst with improved bimetallic and bifunctional effects, the catalyst particles having reduced local composition fluctuations, resulting in much improved catalytic performances, in particular as regards activity and gasoline yields. Such a bed is termed "homogeneous on a micronic scale". The invention also relates to a process for transforming hydrocarbons into aromatic compounds using that catalyst, such as a gasoline reforming process and a process for producing aromatic compounds.<br>
Catalysts for gasoline catalysts and/or for aromatic compound production are well known. They generally contain a matrix, at least one noble metal from the platinum family, at least one halogen and at least one promoter metal, also known as an additional metal.<br>
Of the promoter metals, tin in particular is used for regenerative processes and rhenium is used for fixed bed processes.<br>
Catalysts for gasoline reforming and/or for aromatic compound production are bifunctional catalysts having two functions which are essential for producing the correct performances: a hydro-dehydrogenating function which dehydrogenates naphthenes and hydrogenates coke precursors, and an acid function which isomerises the naphthenes and paraffins and cyclises long paraffins. The hydro-dehydrogenating function can be provided by an oxide such as molybdenum oxide M0O3, chromium oxide Cr203 or gallium oxide Ga3O3, or by a metal from column 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt). Metals, in particular platinum, are known to be much more active than oxide phases for hydro-dehydrogenating reactions, and for this reason metallic catalysts have replaced supported oxide catalysts when reforming gasoline and/or producing aromatic compounds. However, metals such as Ni, and to a lesser extent palladium and platinum, also exhibit a hydrogenolysing activity, to the detriment of the desired gasoline yields when<br><br>
reforming gasoline and/or when producing aromatic compounds. This hydrogenolysing activity can be substantially reduced, and thus the catalyst selectivity can be increased, by adding a second metal such as tin. Further, adding a second metal such as irtdium or rhenium increases the hydrogenating properties of the platinum, encouraging hydrogenation of coke precursors and thus increasing the catalyst stability. These various reasons have encouraged the success of bimetallic catalysts over first generation monometallic catalysts. More recently, trimetallic catalysts have been introduced, which retain the increased stability of bimetallic catalysts while increasing the gasoline selectivities of such catalysts.<br>
Selectivity can be increased by various means. In the prior art, United States patent US-A-5 128 300 recommends, for catalyst extrudates, a homogeneous distribution of tin with a local composition fluctuation of no better than 25% about the average tin content, that being 0,1-2% by weight of the catalyst.<br>
We have discovered, and this constitutes the subject matter of the present invention, that catalyst performances can be substantially improved not only by limiting the variation of a single element, but by controlling the relative fluctuations of the ratio of the composition of noble metal (platinum) to the additional metal and/or of the composition of noble metal (platinum) to the halogen. Thus homogeneity of the bimetallic noble metal - additional metal effect and/or (he bifunctional noble metal -acid effect is obtained in the particle bed which improves the overall performances of the process in which this catalyst is used.<br>
More precisely, the invention provides a homogeneous bed of catalyst particles, said catalyst comprising at least one amorphous matrix, at least one noble metal, at least one additional metal M and at least one halogen, and in which, for one catalyst particle, Cp, is the local concentration of noble metal, CM is<br><br>
the local concentration of additional metal M, and Cx is the local concentration of halogen, in which catalyst particle bed the local dispersion of the value of Cp(/Ow or Cp,/Cx is termed homogeneous along the diameter of the particle, and at least 70% of its values fall within a confidence interval of better than 30% relative.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the local dispersion of the value of C(1,/CM or Opt/Cx in the catalyst particles is termed homogeneous along the diameter of a particle, and.at least 70% of its values fall within a confidence interval of belter than 30% relative.<br>
The amorphous catalyst matrix is generally a refractory oxide such as magnesium, titanium or zirconium oxide, alumina or silica, used alone or mixed together. The preferred support contains alumina or it is alumina.<br>
For gasoline reforming reactions and/or aromatic compound production reactions, the preferred matrix is alumina, and advantageously the specific surface area is 50-600 m2/g, preferably 150-400 m2/g.<br>
The catalyst also contains at least one noble metal from the platinum family (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir), preferably platinum. The catalyst can advantageously contain a noble metal (such as Pt) and also iridium.<br>
The additional metal M is selected from the group formed by tin, germanium, lead, gallium, indium, thallium, rhenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. In the case of processes for reforming gasoline and/or for producing regenerative aromatic compounds in a moving bed, the preferred metal is tin, and very advantageously it is associated with platinum (catalysts containing Pt, Sn) and more advantageously, the catalyst further contains tungsten (catalysts containing Pt, Sn, W).<br>
In fixed bed ' processes, the preferred metal is rhenium; very advantageously it is combined with platinum (catalysts containing Pt, Re); more<br><br>
advantageously still, the cata}yst contains indium (catalysts containing Pt, Re, In); further, tungsten can be present (catalysts containing Pt, Re, W or Pt, Re, In, W).<br>
The halogen is selected from the group formed by fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, Chlorine is preferred.<br>
The catalyst generally contains 0.01% to 2% by weight of a noble metal, 0.1% to 15% of a halogen and 0.005% to 10% of an additional metal. Preferably, the catalyst also contains at most 2% of additional metal M, and very advantageously better than 0.1% of that metal- Under these preferred conditions, the catalyst will perform better due to the optimised bimetallic effect.<br>
It should also be noted that the catalyst used in gasoline and/or aromatic compound production processes preferably contains practically no alkali.<br>
The catalyst is in the form of a bed in the form of particles which may be beads, extrudates, three-lobed particles or any other routinely used form,<br>
Cpt is the local concentration of noble metal (expressed in % by weight) (the noble metal not necessarily being platinum), CM is the local concentration (by weight) of the additional metal and Cx is the local concentration (by weight) of halogen.<br>
The concentrations can also be expressed in atomic %, as the relative fluctuations will be the same.<br>
The overall composition of the catalyst can be determined by X ray<br>
fluorescence carried out on the powdered catalyst or by atomic absorption afler<br>
acid attack of the catalyst.<br>
In   contrast   to   the   overall   composition   of the   catalyst,   the   local<br>
i composition,  on the  micronic  scale  can  be  measured  using  an  electronic<br>
microprobe   and   can   if necessary  be   complemented   by   STEM   (scanning<br>
transmission   electron   microscopy).      This   measurement   can   be   made   by<br>
determining the platinum and additional metal contents in zones of a few cubic<br><br>
microns: along the diameter of a catalyst particle, termed the measurement units. This measurement enables the macroscopic distribution of the metals inside the particles to be determined; more precisely, it is an elemental analysis on a micronic scale.<br>
The relative analyses shown in the accompanying figures were carried out using a JEOL JXA 8800 electronic microprobe (preferred apparatus) or if necessary using a CAMF,BAX type Microbeam, each provided with four wavelength dispersion spectrometers. The acquisition parameters were as follows: acceleration voltage 20 kV, current 30 nA, Pt Ma, Sn La, Cl Ka lines, and count time 20 s or 40 s depending on the measurement to be obtained. The particles (in the figures they were beads) were coated with resin then polished down to their diameter.<br>
It should be noted that the designation "diameter" does not refer only to a bead or extrudate shape, but more generally to any particle shape; the term "diameter" is used to designate the representative length of the particle on which the measurement is made.<br>
Thus from local measurements of Cpt , CM and Cx (i.e., at a determined position on the particle diameter), the local ratios Cpt/CM and/or Cpi/CK can be calculated.<br>
The measurements are made on a representative sample of the bed or catalyst batch which will be used for a catalytic bed.<br>
For each location on the particle diameter, the local average rations[Cpl/CM]m and/or [Cµ/C^]m are calculated (average of corresponding local<br>
ratios).<br>
Thus the absolute values of the differences between each ratio CVJC^ measured locally and the average local ratio Cpt/Cx can be determined.<br><br>
At each point (location on the diameter), the set of Cp,/CM or Cpl/Cx values constitute the local dispersion of the ratio Cpl/CM or Cpt/Cx respectively.<br>
In accordance with the invention, said dispersion is termed homogeneous, meaning that at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, of the values of Cpl/CM or Cpt/Cx for the catalyst particle bed fall within an interval termed the confidence interval which is at most 30% relative. In other words, the divergence for at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, of the values of Cpt/CM or Cpt/Cx for the catalyst bed particles from the average local ratios [Cpl/CM]m and/or [Cpl/Cx]m respectively is at most 30% of the average value.<br>
Preferably, the local dispersion of ratio Cpt/Cx corresponds to a confidence interval of better than 20% or preferably better than 15%, and a confidence interval of better than 10% or even 8% can be reached.<br>
Thus at any point in the catalyst, a variation in the amount of element M is accompanied by a contfolled variation in the platinum content, such that the ratio Pt/M remains within an optimum spread. This approach enables the "bimetallic effect" to be fully expressed.<br>
The bimetallic effect corresponds to the quality of the interaction between the platinum and the metal M, which effect conditions the performance of the catalyst.<br>
An optimum CP,/CM atomic ratio frequently exists to one side of which the "bimetallic effect" is less pronounced and beyond which the activity of (lie catalyst is reduced by an excess of additional metal. Such an optimum is also observed in trimelallic catalysts between the noble metal and metal M. To fully benefit from the bimetallic effect resulting from adding one or more additional metals, it is important that the ratio Cpt/CM, measured locally for each catalyst particle, is as close as possible and varies as little as possible about an optimum value.<br><br>
A further very important parameter for the catalytic performance of catalysts, in particular those used for gasoline reforming and/or for aromatic compound production, is the amount of halogen (chlorine), in particular the local halogen concentration1 with respect to the local concentration of noble metal In this case it is a bifunctional metal-acid effect.<br>
The halogen (chlorine) is responsible for the acid function of catalysts which undertake isomerisation and cyclisation of C6-Cn catalysts. For each catalyst, there is an optimum halogen (chlorine) content. For chlorine contents below this optimum content, catalysts suffer from a lack of activity in particular as regards dehydrocyclisation of P7-P9 paraffins, For chlorine contents over this optimum content, the catalysts exhibit an excessive cracking activity resulting in a large production of C3-C4 fuel gas, and thus a drop in gasoline yields. The optimum chlorine concentration depends on the nature of the support, on its specific surface area and1 on its structure. It is usually close to 1,0% by weight or over that value for certain particular supports, or in the presence of doping elements such as silicon included in the support.<br>
This results in local Cp(/Cx concentration ratios which are significantly different from the local average ratio, resulting in mediocre catalytic performances.<br>
Normally, the average local ratio [Cpt/CM]m or the average local ratio [Cpl/Cx]m is constant along the diameter of the catalyst particle. The profile [Cp,/CM]m as a function of diameter is thus a "flat profile", like a profile of Cpt , CM or Cx with diameter (depending on the case). The noble metal and/or metal M and/or halogen is uniformly distributed in the particle.<br>
It is also of interest to prepare catalysts with different core and peripheral concentrations Cpt, CM or Cx. These catalysts have "bowl" or "dome" distribution profiles. These catalysts with bowl or dome CM or Cp( distributions are of interest<br><br>
in certain applications where the effects of diffusion rates of the reactants or products in the catalyst are exploited.<br>
In that case, the value of the local average ratio [Cpl/CM]m varies as a function of the particle diameter. This variation can substantially follow a parabolic curve calculated from at least two values of [Cpt/CM]m determined at the periphery and at least one value determined at the centre,<br>
A further distribution type is the "skin" distribution where the noble metal and/or metal M are distributed at the surface.<br>
In general, the core/edge ratio of concentrations Cpt, CM or Cx at the centre and periphery of the catalyst particles can vary from 0.1 to 3.<br>
In a prefered variation, the catalyst contains at least one metal M and the noble metal (preferably Pt), uniformly distributed in the catalyst particle.<br>
In a further possibility, the catalyst contains at least one metal M uniformly distributed in the whole catalyst, the noble metal being "bowl" distributed. In a further variation, at least one metal M is uniformly distributed throughout the catalyst, the noble metal being "skin" distributed.<br>
Metal M in the above case is advantageously tin. Preferably, the platinum and tin are bowl distributed,<br>
Figures 1 to 4 illustrate the invention and the prior art, as a dome or a bowl:<br>
•	Figures 1A and IB show bowl or dome distributions;<br>
•	Figure 2 corresponds to the prior art;<br>
•	Figures 3A, 3B and 4 correspond to the invention as described in the examples below.<br>
The general ca^G described in the present patent is illustrated in Figures 1A, IB, 3A and 3B; at least 70% of the local Cp{/CM ratios along the particle diameter varies by less than 30% about the average local ratio [C,„/CM]„,.    The<br><br>
latter (the variation of the local average concentration ratio) can be a straight line (Figures 3 corresponding to catalysts B and C of the examples of the present invention), or a parabola ("bowl1' or "dome" distribution of Figures I).<br>
Very preferably, the catalyst contains at least one metal M uniformly distributed throughout the catalyst, the noble metal also being uniformly distributed through the catalyst particle.<br>
In one technique of the invention, the catalyst is obtained by impregnating an organic solution of at least one compound of said metal M, the volume of the solution preferably being equal to the retention volume of the support or in excess with respect to that volume. Metal M is introduced in the form of at least one organic compound selected from the group formed by complexes of metals M and hydrocarbylmetals such as metal alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls, alkylaryls and arylalkyls, After leaving the solid and impregnating solution in contact for several hours, the product is dried. The operation is normally completed by calcining between 3OO°C and 6OO°C, preferably in a stream of air for several hours. The solid obtained is then impregnated using an aqueous or organic solution of at least one compound of a group V1TI metal, the volume of the solution preferably being in excess with respect to the retention volume of the support or equal to that volume. After being left in contact for several hours, the product obtained is dried then calcined in air between 3OO°C and 6OO°C, preferably in a stream of air for several hours.<br>
In a further method in accordance with the invention, tin can be introduced during alumina synthesis using a sol-gel type technique (co-precipitation). As an example, a mixed tin alumina gel can be obtained by hydrolysing an organic solution of Sn(OR)4 and Al(OR'),t in a solvent such as ROM or R'OII. R and \V can designate a methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl or butyl alkyl group or a heavier group such as n-hexyl.  The alcoholic solvent must be severely dehydrated before<br><br>
introducing the tin and aluminium alcoholates. Hydrolysis can be achieved by adding water to the mixture or by adding an anhydrous carhoxylic acid followed by gradual etherification (solvolysis) with heat. The second technique generally leads to more homogeneous A^O^-SnO* mixed oxides as it results in homogeneous and simultaneous formation of water in the mixture. The reactivity of the tin alcoholates as regards water (hydrolysis) is generally higher than thai of the aluminium alcoholates but it decreases with the length of the alkyl chain R, Thus the molecular weights of groups R and R' can be selected such that the reactivities of the corresponding aluminium and tin alcoholates are comparable. This can further improve the homogeneity of the metal distribution in the mixed gels obtained. Tin and aluminium can also be co-precipitated in an aqueous solution, for example by dissolving SnCl2 and AICI3 in a solution acidified with HC1, then pouring the acid solution in the form of microdroplets (spray, nebulisation) into a solution in water with a pi I in the range 6 to 9,<br>
The metals can be introduced using any technique known to the skilled person. The additional metal can be introduced at any stage of the catalyst manufacture, for example during alumina synthesis using a sol-gel (co-precipitation) technique or when forming the catalyst (extrusion, oil-drop, or any known technique).<br>
In accordance with the invention, the catalyst described above is used in processes for reforming gasoline and for producing aromatic compounds. Reforming processes increase the octane number of gasoline fractions from distilling crude oil and/or from other refining processes. Aromatic compound production processes provide bases (benzene, toluene and xylenes) for use in the petrochemicals industry. These processes are of additional importance in that they contribute to the production of large quantities of hydrogen which is indispensable for hydrogenation and hydrotreatment processes carried out in the refinery.  These<br><br>
two processes differ from each other in the choice of operating conditions and in the composition of the feed, which facts are known to the skilled person.<br>
In general, a typical feed treated by these processes contains paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons containing 5 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. This feed is defined, inter alia, by its density and composition by weight. This feed is brought into contact with the catalyst of the present invention at a temperature in the range 4OO°C to 7OO°C. The mass flow rate of the treated feed per unit mass of catalyst can be from 0,1 to 10 kg/kg/h. The operating pressure can be set at between atmospheric pressure and 4 MPa. A portion of the hydrogen produced is recycled in a molar recycle ratio in the range 0.1 to 10. This ratio is the molar ratio of the flow rate of recycled hydrogen to the feed flow rate.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (comparative)<br>
The reference catalyst or catalyst A was a bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst prepared using prior art techniques from S11CI2, comprising 0.25% by weight of platinum, 0.14% by weight of tin and 1.2% by weight of chlorine. The support was a y alumina with a specific surface area of 210 m per gram. 500 cm of an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and stannic chloride containing 0,14 g of tin was added to 100 g of alumina support. It was left in contact for 3 hours and drained. The solid was then brought into contact with 500 cm of an aqueous solution of hexachloroplatinic acid containing 0.25 g of platinum. It was left in contact for 3 hours, dried for 1 hour at l2OºC then calcined for 2 hours at 5OO°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (in accordance with the invention)<br>
Catalyst B, with the same composition, was prepared by impregnating with an organometallic tin complex. 100 g of alumina support was brought into contact with 60 cm of an n-heptane solution containing 0.14 g of tin in the form of tctrabutyltin, Sn(nu)4.   After 3 hours of reaction at room temperature, the solid<br><br>
was dried for 1 hour at l2(TC then calcined at 5OO°C for 2 hours. 100 g of this solid was then brought into contact with 500 cm of an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and hexachloroplatinic acid containing 0.25 g of platinum. It was left in contact for 3 hours, dried for 1 hour at 120oC then calcined for 2 hours at 5OO°C,<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (in accordance with the invention)<br>
Catalyst C was prepared by co-precipitating aluminium and tin in an aqueous solution followed by homogeneous deposition of platinum. It contained 0.25% by weight of platinum, 0.14% by weight of tin and 1.2% by weight of chlorine. A mixed AI2O3 - Sn02. mH20 hydroxide was prepared by co-precipitating a solution of stannic chloride and aluminium chloride at a pH of 8 using NH4NO3 as the precipitation agent. The precipitate was washed with distilled water and dried for 12 hours at l2OºC• It was then calcined at 53O°C for 2 hours in air containing 500 ppm of H20. Platinum was then introduced into 100 g of this solid by bringing it into contact with 500 cm3 of a toluene solution containing 0.25 g of platinum in the form of platinum bis-acetylacetonate. It was left in contact for 3 hours, dried for 1 hour at l2OºC then calcined for 2 hours at 5OO°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The local platinum and tin concentrations for the three catalysts A, B and C were measured using an electronic microprobe technique. Figures 2 (for catalyst A) and 3A (for catalyst B) and 3B (for catalyst C) had local dispersion ratios Cp,/Cs„ about the value of the local average ratio. For catalyst A, only 49% of the points were within the confidence interval (Figure 2). Catalysts B and C of the present invention (Figures 3) produced a far narrower dispersion of points, 8% and 14% respectively of the local Cpt/QSn ratios being outside the confidence interval.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of the ratios of locnl C,,AVt concentrations along the diameter of catalyst B particles. It can be seen that 9% of the points are outside the confidence interval.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Samples of catalysts A, R and C, the preparation of which has been described above, were tested by transforming a feed with the following characteristics:<br>
Density at 2O°C	0,753 kg/dm3<br>
Research octane number	~ 60<br>
Paraffin content	49.4% by volume<br>
Naphthene content	35.1% by volume<br>
Aromatics content	15.5% by volume<br>
This transformation was carried out in the presence of hydrogen under the<br>
following operating conditions:<br>
Temperature	49O°C<br>
Total pressure	0.3 MPa<br>
Feed flow rate	2.0 kg per kg of catalyst<br>
Before injecting the feed, the catalysts were activated at high temperature in hydrogen for 2 hours. The performances obtained after 24 hours of operation<br><br><br>
The catalytic performances of catalysts B and C were substantially better than those of catalyst A, both as regards the quantity of reformate produced and the octane number of the reformate.<br><br><br><br>
