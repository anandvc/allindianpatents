				<td>Bone morphogenetic proteins containing a heparin binding site and osteo-genic devices and pharmaceutical products containing thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to bone formation inducing proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), especially BMP-6, containing a heparin binding site, nucleic acid molecules encoding said proteins, vectors containing said nucleic acid molecules and host cells expressing said proteins. The present invention relates also to the use of said bone morphogenetic proteins for treating disorders, such as disorders related to bone and cartilage formation. The present invention further relates to osteogenic devices and pharmaceutical compositions containing said proteins.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The phenomenon of osteoinduction was recognized by Lancroix in 1945 when he demonstrated that acid alcohol bone extracts induced heterotopic bone formation in ectopic sites. Twenty years later Urist and his co-workers decalcified bone matrix and observed new cartilage and bone formation when implanted intramuscularly. These discoveries led to isolation and purification of bone inducing agent named BMPs from bone matrix of different species and years later to cloning and characterization of several cDNAs encoding these novel proteins. The biological activity of BMPs has been determined by bioassay in rat or mouse muscle bounces or by ALP measurements in mammalian cell cultures.<br>
Previous studies since 1965 have shown that BMPs are part of the TGF-p super-family and like all the family members they have multiple effects on cell migration, growth and differentiation especially in bone formation and tissue repair but also in embryogenesis or cancer. They are tow molecular weight hydrophobic glycopro-teins which are soluble to chaotrophic agents such as urea and guanidinium hy-drochloride but are resistant to several proteases, for example collagenases.<br>
BMPs are produced as large precursor molecules which are processed proteolyti-cally to mature peptides after the translation. Like all the members of TGF-p super-family, BMPs have the pattern of seven cysteine residues in their C-terminal mature region. Between these cysteines there are three disulfide bonds within mature<br><br>
BMP monomers and one disulfide bond which combines two monomers into a biologically active BMP dimer.<br>
BMPs act through specific transmembrane receptors located on cell surface of the target cells. The BMP receptors are serin-threonin kinases which resemble TGF-p receptors and are divided into two subgroups: type I and type II receptors. BMPs can bind strongly only to the heterotetrameric complex of these receptors. This complex formation is essential to the BMP signal transduction. Inside the target cell, BMP signals are transmitted to the nucleus via specific signal molecules called Smads, which are also responsible for suppression of BMP signals.<br>
Until now, 16 different BMPs have been characterized and seven of them (BMPs 2-7 and 9) have shown to be able to induce bone formation when implanted in ectopic sites. According to the amino acid sequence of the mature part these BMPs are divided into two subgroups. BMPs 2 and 4 are 86% identical and BMPs 5, 6 and 7 are 78% identical. Between these two groups the identity is only about 56%. The amino acid sequence of BMP-3 is about 45% alike with BMPs 2 and 4 and BMP-9 is 50-55% identical with BMPs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Due to high homology and small variety in size, BMPs are quite difficult, very time consuming and expensive to separate, purify and identify from each other at protein level. This is the reason why most of the BMPs are nowadays being produced using molecular biological tools. Different kinds of recombinant protein techniques have been tested and both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems have been utilized.<br>
Majority of research has focused on human recombinant BMPs, but with regard to effective bone induction antlers of Cetvidae family form an interesting research area. Antlers are bony cranial organs typical to the Cervidae family and they differ from Bovidae horns in their growing pattern. Antlers grow from the tip and males cast them away once per year. It has been suggested that antlers are the fastest growing structures through the mammalian species and they are known to be the only structures that regenerate completely every year. Antlers are formed by modified endochondral ossification meaning that the process is performed through the highty vascularized cartilage model which is calcified and finally transformed into bone. Antlers form an interesting model of adult regenerating mineralized tissue, and bone remodeling has been shown to continue until the time of antler casting. Although the ultimate reason for the amazing speed of antler growth has not yet been resolved, antlers have been shown to contain several BMPs. Deer antler has been proven to express BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Feng et al. 1997 Biochim Biophys<br><br>
Acta 1350:47-52; Feng et at. 1995 Biochim Biophys Acta 1263:163-168). In addition, reindeer antlers express BMP-3b (Kapanen et al. 2002 J Biomed Mat Res 59:78-83). Yet, it is also possible that there is one or more totally uncovered factor^) which are responsible for antler growth speed.<br>
Due to their osteoinductive capacity, both BMPs extracted from demineralized bone matrix and BMPs produced by recombinant technique are very interesting and highly potential alternatives to bone grafting. Different BMPs have been used in many experimental and clinical studies.<br>
Bone morphogenetic protein 6 has been characterized from many different origins including some mammalian species like mouse, rat, human and bovine. Yet, it has not been characterized from deer animals unlike BMP-2, BMP-3b and BMP-4 which all have been cloned from antlers of either deer or reindeer, both members of Cervidae family (Feng et al. 1997; Feng et al. 1995; Kapanen era/. 2002). Considering the fact that BMP-6 is an important regulator molecule in chondrogenesis it is probable that it is expressed in antlers just as the earlier cloned members of BMP family.<br>
Until now, BMP-3b has been the only BMP characterized in reindeer antler tissue (Kapanen etal. 2002).<br>
US 5 399 677 discloses DNA molecules encoding mutant forms of bone morphogenetic proteins. The mutant forms of BMP can be produced bacterially and refolded to produce biologically active homodimers or heterodimers of BMP. A method of making such mutant BMP is also disclosed. Said mutant forms are useful since they are correctly folded when produced in bacterial hosts.<br>
WO 98/51354 discloses osteogenic devices and methods of use thereof for repair of bone and cartilage defects. The method for producing new bone growth at bone defect site in a mammal comprises the step of Implanting in a defect site a calcium phosphate matrix comprising at least one osteogenic protein. Said osteogenic proteins include several morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic proteins.<br>
US 6 207 813 discloses purified human BMP-6 proteins and processes for producing them. The publication also discloses commonly known pharmaceutical compositions, medical uses and methods employing said human BMP-6 protein. BMP-6 has been localized in hypertrophic cartilage and it is an important regulator in<br><br>
chondrocyte maturation process. When mouse BMP-6 overexpressing CHO cells were introduced directly into the subcutaneous tissue of athymic nude mice, they formed tumors surrounded by extensive connective tissue containing large regions of cartilage and bone. This suggests that BMP-6 induces endochondral bone formation in vivo. BMP-6 has also been indicated to enhance osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro when the cells were trans-fected with vector overexpressing mouse BMP-6. Furthermore, recombinant human BMP-6 has been shown to take part in osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. The osteoinductive activity of recombinant human BMP-6 produced in CHO cells has been verified by in vivo test in rat muscle. Nevertheless, the biological activity of BMP-6 from any origin produced as recombinant protein in E. coli system has not yet been published. Neither has anybody published information of the biological activity of BMP-6 cloned from the antler tissue of any member of Cervidae family.<br>
EP 1131087 discloses further use for morphogenetic proteins, such as BMP proteins. It is shown that exposing cancer cells to morphogens inhibits cancer cell growth and causes such cells to differentiate away from the cancerous phenotype. The use of morphogen can influence cancer cell fate and, in turn, alleviate the symptoms of cancer. Preferred morphogens disclosed include BMP-6.<br>
WO 90/11366 discloses BMP proteins including a bovine BMP-6 for which DNA and amino acid sequences are presented. The amino acid sequence does not correspond to the one currently known for bovine BMP-6 but instead it is identical to the reindeer BMP-6 disclosed herein. The activity or other properties of said BMP-6 are not tested or described in WO 90/11366.<br>
Although some applications of known BMP proteins as bone and cartilage forming inducers or for alleviating the symptoms of cancer are already known, there is still need for better methods for isolating such proteins and for better morphogenetic proteins, for example ones which possess more efficient bone forming properties or are more soluble. Such proteins would be useful for better therapeutic methods and applications. Also methods for producing such proteins would be useful.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an isolated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which is not BMP-2, containing a heparin binding site (HBS). The heparin binding site improves the expression of the recombinant BMP protein and also enhances the biological activity thereof. Further, the heparin binding site significantly helps the expression of recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins in bacterial cells, such as £ co//.<br>
In the present invention a BMP-6 protein isolated from reindeer, despite having high sequence homology with already known bone morphogenetic proteins, has very advantageous properties related to bone and cartilage forming. Said properties are substantially better than the properties of the known corresponding BMP proteins. Said bone morphogenetic protein of the present invention and homo-logues thereof are useful for inducing bone and cartilage formation in several kinds of applications, such as therapeutic applications. The isolated bone morphogenetic protein may include also the propeptide part of the protein. The presence of this part stabilizes the BMP and modulate its functional activity.<br>
Further, the cDNA of the BMP-6 protein of the present invention was truncated without causing any changes in protein sequence to get as high expression levels as possible when produced as recombinant protein in a host cell system. A heparin binding site (HBS) was added in front of the rdBMP-6 gene and this addition made the expression possible also in £ co//TOP10 strain where the expression of plain rdBMP-6 was blocked.<br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a bone morphogenetic protein with a heparin binding site (HBS). Generally this is an amino acid sequence capable of binding heparin. In one embodiment said heparin binding site is located at the amino terminus of said BMP, such as before the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or functional homo-logue thereof. In one embodiment the heparin binding site contains amino acid sequence AKHKQRKRGT (Figure 8) or QAKHKQRKRGT (Figure 6). Said heparin binding site may also be a functional homologue, derivative or fragment thereof.<br><br>
The bone morphogenetic proteins useful in the present invention comprise all the known bone morphogenetic proteins excluding BMP-2. Preferred bone morphogenetic proteins are selected from BMP3 (such as BMP-3c), BMP-4 and BMP-6 and homologues thereof. More preferably said proteins are originated from reindeer. References are made to the patent applications FI20055256 and FI20055258 disclosing reindeer BMP-3c (SEQ ID NO: 3) and BMP-4 (SEQ ID NO: 4), respectively, by the present inventors and from which the present application claims priority. These and all the other documents referred herein are incorporated by reference. All said BMPs originated from reindeer have shown to have especially good bone and cartilage forming properties. The reindeer BMP-6 protein is described herein in details.<br>
The highest homology at amino acid level among mature parts of previously known BMP-6 is between mouse and rat (98%) and between rat and human (98%) (Table 1). Cloning and characterization of reindeer BMP-6 mature part revealed that it has the highest homology with bovine BMP-6 (Wozney et al. 1998). At the amino acid level there was difference of only one amino acid between these two polypeptides, and homology reached 99% (Table 1). Even at the nucleotide level the homology between mature parts of reindeer and bovine BMP-6 was 95%, which is as high as between those of mouse and rat (Table 1). Generally BMP-6 has homology also with other types of BMPs, for example with BMP-5 and BMP-7.<br>

The following aligrmnent straws the amino acid sequences of humarrand reindeer mature BMP-6 proteins (made with ClustalX 1.8 program (Thompson, J.D., Hig-gins, D.G. and Gibson, T.J. (1994) Nucleic Acids Research, 22: 4673-4680), rdBMP-6 = reindeer BMP-6, hBMP-6 = human BMP-6, the asterisks show the identical amino acids). The mature parts of these amino acid sequences differ by<br><br>
seven amino acids near the amino terminus. Probably the most essential differences are caused by the pralines in rdBMP-6, Pro3 and especially Pro16, which are very likely to affect the folding or structure of the mature protein. Human BMP-6 is the closest counterpart of reindeer BMP-6 having the activity thereof determined.<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
The "BMP-6 protein of the invention" or "bone morphogenetic protein of the invention" refer to a protein having bone morphogenetic (or morphogenic as both words are used interchangeably) activity, such as BMP-6 isolated from reindeer as described herein (SEQ ID NO: 1 of the attached sequence listing or rdBMP-6 in the alignment above), and includes homologues, analogs, derivatives and fragments thereof. The definition refers also to modifications described below, such as a BMP containing a specific functional sequence, e.g. heparin binding site, propep-tide or the like. Such homologues or derivatives include functional derivatives of said protein, such as proteins derived from the original reindeer BMP-6 protein or any BMP from any species. The derivatives may differ in length and they may contain amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions, as a person skilled in the art well knows. Characteristic for the bone morphogenetic protein 6 of the present invention, e.g. as disclosed in the alignment above, are the amino acids differing from the known BMP-6 proteins, such as the amino acids differing from the human counterpart, especially Pro3 and Pro16. Preferably the regions containing these amino acids are conserved in a bone morphogenetic protein of the present invention. These may be the amino acids 3-23, or more preferably amino acids 3-16, in the SEQ ID NO: 1 or homologue thereof. The amino acids 3 and 16 are prolines which have a strong effect on the folding of the mature protein and therefore also<br><br>
on the function of the protein. The amino acids 3 and 23 define the region containing amino acids differing from the human BMP-6 counterpart.<br>
On the other hand, insertions, deletions and substitutions located far outside said characteristic area may not be likely to cause substantial changes in the function, effect or folding of the BMP of the present invention. For example homologues having deletions, such as deletions of few amino acids, preferably 1-10 amino acids, more preferably 1-5 amino acids, most preferably 1-3 amino acids, in car-boxyl terminus or amino terminus resulting in shorter polypeptide are in the scope of the present invention as long as said deletions do not affect the characteristic amino acids of the BMP of the invention. It is preferred that said homologues have the advantageous properties of the original reindeer BMP-6 proteins, said properties being related to said characteristic amino acids and/or the region around them. Said homologues may have amino acid substitutions which do not substantially affect the function and effect of the protein of the invention. For example an amino acid not located in the active site or near it may be substituted with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties (e.g. hydrophobic or hydrophilic), i.e. conservative amino acid replacement, amino acid as long as said substitution does not substantially alter the function or folding of the mature protein. These kinds of substitutions are well known and understood in the art. Examples of such amino acid properties divided into groups are hydrophobic (Met, Ala, Val, Leu, He), neutral hydrophilic (Cys, Ser, Thr), acidic (Asp, Glu), basic (Asn, Gin, His, Lys, Arg), residues that influence chain orientation (Gly, Pro) and aromatic (Trp, Tyr, Phe) amino acids. Substitutions within said groups are generally not likely to cause major changes in the structure of the polypeptide backbone (e.g. a sheet or helical conformation), the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule or the bulk of the side chain.<br>
The homologues of the BMP of the present invention include for example any known bone morphogenetic protein which contains or has been modified to contain at least part of the conserved amino acids or sequences as described above or corresponding area in a homologous BMP in the case the numbering should differ. Also any currently unknown BMP-6 protein from any species modified as described is in the scope of the invention.<br>
When compared to known human BMP-6 protein, the reindeer BMP-6 has seven substituted amino acids P3, G4, A10, P16, A17, S21 and A23 defined from the mature BMP-6 protein as disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1. These amino acids are<br><br>
characteristic for the BMP of the present invention. More specifically P3 and/or P16 are especially characteristic for the BMP of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the consensus sequence between the two prolines: P-G/S/N-R/K-R/H-Q/N-Q-A/S/N-R-N/S-R/A/K-S/A-T/S/N-P. This consensus sequence has been defined from a sequence alignment of several similar BMP-6, BMP-5 and BMP-7 proteins from different species, such as shown in the ClustalX alignment below. Said consensus sequence corresponds to the amino acids 3-16 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the corresponding consensus sequence defined from BMP-6 family: P-G/S-R-R-R-Q-Q-A/S-R-N-R/A-S-T-P. Also other consensus sequences may be defined, for example ones defining an area around the second proline (Pro16 in SEQ ID NO: 1), such as R-N/S-R/A/K-S/A-T/S/N-P-A-Q-D-V, or similar sequences differing in length, e.g. by 1-5 amino acids. Such consensus sequences may be defined from the alignment below or similar alignments made by aligning different related BMP proteins. The BMP-6, BMP-5 and BMP-7 sequences aligned are from reindeer, bovine, rat, mouse, human, chicken and African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention said BMP is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof comprising the amino acids 3-16 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. Said amino acid locations are calculated from amino terminus of any general mature BMP-6 protein, such as the protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof, wherein the sequence at the amino terminus begins<br><br>
with SA, as for example in reindeer (see the sequence alignment above or SEQ ID NO: 1), or at a corresponding area. If there were any insertions or deletions of amino acids in the amino acid sequence of said homologue affecting the numbering, these should be taken into account when defining the location of said essential amino acids, for example by aligning the sequences as described above and then defining the locations of said amino acids. However, any of said homologues, derivatives or fragments of the BMP-6 protein should substantially have the function and efficiency disclosed herein. Because all the known BMP-6 proteins are highly conserved, defining the location of said essential prolines is unambiguous, such as in the case of human BMP-6. Also, said locations can be easily defined also from other BPMs (see the alignment above). Generally such level of homol-ogy may be at least 70%, preferably 80%, more preferably 90% and most preferably 93% at the amino acid level.<br>
In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 3-23 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is a BMP-6 protein. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is a BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The homologues, derivatives or fragments mentioned in these embodiments shall contain at least one of the characteristic amino acids described above. Said homologues, derivatives or fragments do not include the known BMP-6 proteins as such, such as hBMP-6, since they do not contain said characteristic amino acids of the BMP of the present invention. However, a known BMP modified to contain at least one of said characteristic amino acids may be considered as such homologue, derivative or fragment.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides the BMP as described above with a propeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a functional homologue, derivative or fragment thereof. Said propeptide plays a role in the control of a BMP protein and in the proper folding of the protein. Similar propeptides are known in the art (see Regulation of bone morphogenetic protein activity by pro domains and proprotein convertases. Consiam DB, Robertson EJ. J Cell Biol. 1999 Jan 11; 144{1):139-49.) The BMP propeptide or homologue thereof may be inserted in the amino terminus of a BMP protein, such as BMP-6 protein, wherein the propeptide facilitates the folding of the mature protein. Later on the propeptide may be cleaved off.<br><br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a nucleic acid molecule, such as a DNA or RNA molecule, encoding said BMP of the invention, with or without the heparin binding site or the propeptide. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code there are a number of different nucleic acid sequences encoding the BMP of the invention, said heparin binding site or said propeptide. All such nucleic acid variants are in the scope of the present invention. Preferably said nucleic acid molecule is a DNA molecule. Non-limiting examples of said DNA sequences are disclosed in figures 5-10.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a replicable nucleotide vector containing the nucleic acid molecule described above in operative association with an expression control sequence thereof. Such vector may be used for producing recombinant BMP of the present invention in a suitable host system.<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the BMP of the invention may be inserted into said replicable vector for cloning or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques well known in the art. Vector components may include for example one or more signal sequence(s), an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of such suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Generally said BMP may be produced recombinantly by expressing in any suitable host cell, such as bacterial host cell. Such methods are well known in the art and they are described in literature. It is essential that the protein is folded properly during the expression and it contains the necessary post-translational modifications.<br>
It is not always possible to express and purify certain proteins properly, for example because of solubility or refolding problems. Usually £ coli can not make post-translational modifications typical for mammalian cell systems. However, the inventors of the present invention have produced recombinant reindeer BMP-6 mature part in E coli and after purification and refolding managed to prove it to be in biologically active form.<br><br>
There are certain benefits when a protein, such as a BMP, is expressed in a bacterial host, such as E. coli. The protein generally shows lowered immunogenicity when compared to a similar protein expressed in for example yeast host. This may be useful later when the protein is utilized, for example administered as a medicament. E. coli produces proteins without modifications, such as glycosylation. This is particularly useful for proteins for which glycosylation is not a requirement, but which could be a problem if the protein is produced in other systems (e.g. yeast), which can over-glycosylate, or add inappropriate carbohydrates to the protein, which could lead to reduced or no activity of expressed protein and potentially create a nsk of immunogenicity (Pedro de Noronha Pissarra: Recombinant DNA Proteins for the Biopharmaceutical Industry and the Future for Escherichia coli. Business Briefing: Pharma Outsourcing, London, 2004).<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a host cell containing the nu-cleotide molecule or the nucleotide vector described above. Suitable cells include all proka-yotic and eukaryotic cells which are able to express the protein of the invention. Such host cells are well known in the art and a person skilled in the art can easily choose a suitable one. Non-limiting examples of said cells are widely used Esc^richia coli cells, such as TOP 10, Origami B (DE3) or Rosetta (DE3) strains.<br>
Another embodiment provides a BMP produced by culturing said cell to express said protein and by recovering said expressed protein from said host cell. Any suitable methods for recovering or isolating the protein may be used and such methods a-e well-known in the art.<br>
The BMP of the invention may be used for treating disorders related to bone, cartilage, tendon or periodontal defects or diseases or the like wherein regeneration, repair or growth thereof is desired, or other diseases. The protein of the invention may also be used to heal wounds, such as burns, incisions and ulcers, and to related tissue repair and also for treatment of cancer, as disclosed in EP1131087. Since BMP proteins generally lack species specificity, the patient suffering from said defec: may be any suitable animal, preferably mammal, such as human, and the BMP protein used for treatment may be of any suitable origin. The use of related BMP proteins for several types of therapeutical applications is well-known in the art (see e.g. US 6 245 889 and WO98/51354).<br><br>

In the following description and examples it is described how recombinant reindeer BMPs, such as BMP-6, BMP-3c and BMP-4 mature parts with and without hepa-rin-binding site (HBS) according to embodiments of the present invention were produced in £ coll. After purification and refolding the osteoinductive activity was verified by bioassay in mouse tight muscle pounches. The in vivo bioassay is a standard method used for assaying BMP activity since its discovery. It includes implantation of BMP in the hindquarter muscle of a mouse and estimation of het-erotopic new bone induction after 10-21 days by radiology and histology.<br>
Image analysis in determination of BMP activity is done by attenuation of X-ray beam through bone and it can be seen on the radiograph as an X-ray-positive "ra-dioplaque" shadow compared to soft tissues. This is the basis for radiographic detection and radiomorphometric quantitation of newly formed bone after implantation of BMP or other bone inductive agent in a heterotopic or an orthotopic site.<br>
The osteoinduction was observed in all three study groups (1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg of recombinant reindeer BMP-6) and it was increased in dose-dependent manner (Table 2). When compared to its human counterpart the recombinant reindeer BMP-6 was proven to be more potent inducer of bone formation and could therefore be potential agent for clinical applications.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Table 2. Comparison of the osteoinduction responses of reindeer and human BMP-6 proteins with different doses (k=killed)<br>
The results of the in vivo bioassay are shown in figure 12, Figure 12A is a reference implanted with hBMP-6 and 12B is a sample implanted with BMP-6 of the present invention. The bioassay was carried out as described in Marshall R. Urist, J.J. Chang, A. Lietze, Y. K. Huo, A. G. Brownell and R. J. DeLange (1987): Preparation and Bioassay of Bone Morphogenetic Protein and Polypeptide Fragments, Methods Enzymol 146: 294-312.<br>
At first, there were great difficulties to get recombinant rdBMP-6 mature part expressed in E. coll. Even the mutations made to get the nucleotide sequence of rdBMP-6 to resemble the codon usage in £ coll did not seem to cause any improvement in expression level. Therefore, the inventors assumed that poor expression was caused by the high GC-content in N-terminal region of the mature part of rdBMP-6. Because heparin binding site (HBS), existing in the beginning of the reindeer BMP-2 mature part, is coded by nucleotide sequence with low GC-content, a construct in which this HBS sequence was added in front of the rdBMP-6 mature part sequence was created and this way the inventors surprisingly managed to improve the expression of recombinant rdBMP-6.<br>
HBS located in the N-terminus of rdBMP-2 contains 10 basic amino acid residues and is reminiscent of known or postulated heparin-binding sites in other growth factors. It is possible that the interaction between protein with HBS and extracellular matrix might have an important effect on the establishment of morphogenetic gradients during development by limiting the free diffusion of a protein. Therefore, it was assumed that HBS could also improve the biological activity of recombinant rdBMP-6 by prolonging the duration of disappearance of protein from the implantation site, which was also demonstrated by bioassay.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Cloning and sequencing of 3'-part of the cDNA of reindeer BMP-6 A. RNA isolation<br>
The antlers of a 3-year-old male reindeer were cut off and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after slaughtering. The frozen antlers were cut in 0.5 cm slices and stored at -70°C. Reindeer antler mRNA was isolated using the QuickPrep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). A part of the reindeer antler slice was cut in small pieces (about 1 mm3) and 0.1 g of this tissue was added to 0.6 ml of Extraction Buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate and N-lauroyl sarcosine. The tissue was homogenized with Ultra Turrax for 3 times 10 seconds on ice and cooled between every homogenization. 1.2 ml of Elution Buffer was added and suspension was further homogenized for 1 times 10 seconds. A uniform suspension was obtained.<br>
The reindeer antler homogenate and Oligo(dT)-Cellulose were centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 1 minute. The buffer from the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet was removed and the cleared tissue homogenate was placed on the top of it. The tube was inverted to resuspend the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet. The suspension was gently mixed for 5 minutes and centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. The supernatant was discarded.<br>
OHgo(dT)-Cellulose was resuspended in High-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCI] and suspension was centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. Washings with High-Salt Buffer were repeated for 5 times and 2 additional times with Low-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCI]. 3 ml Low-Salt Buffer was added and suspension was transferred to MicroSpin Column. The MicroSpin Column was placed in Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at top speed for 5 seconds. Ollgo(dT)-Cellulose in the column was rinsed for 3 times with Low-Salt Buffer.<br>
The reindeer antler mRNA was eluted to a clean Eppendorf tube from the Micro-Spin Column by adding 0.2 ml 65°C Elution Buffer (QuickPrep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit, Pharmacia Biotech) to the column and centrifuging at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 seconds. The elution step<br>
was repeated twice. The isolated mRNA was precipitated by adding 5 (jl of glyco-gen solution (5-10 mg/ml in DEPC-treated H2O), 1/10 volume K Acetate solution (2.5 M potassium acetate, pH 5.0) and 0.5 ml absolute ethanol (chilled to -20°C) to each elution. Precipitation was allowed to occur at -20°C for at least 30 minutes and mRNA was centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, 4°C, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 minutes. Precipitated mRNA was stored at -70°C until cDNA synthesis was performed.<br>
B. cDNA synthesis<br>
Reverse transcription of the reindeer antler mRNA was performed by modifying the instructions of the Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). 3 ug of mRNA was heat-denatured at 65°C for 10 minutes and chilled on ice. 0.2 pmol DTT, 0.5 µg Oligo(dT)12_18 Primer and heat-denatured mRNA were added to First strand reaction mix containing FPLCpure™ Cloned Murine Reverse Tran-scriptase, RNAguard™, RNase/DNase-Free BSA, dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The mixed solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. After the incubation, the First strand reaction mix was added to the Second strand reaction mix containing E coll RNase H and E. coll DNA polymerase I and dNTPs in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The solution was mixed gently and incubated in RT for 30 minutes. The synthesized cDNA was stored at 4<br>
C. Screening of reindeer antler cDNA<br>
The part of the cDNA of the reindeer BMP-6 was amplified by PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) method using degenerative primers (5'-CGG(C)ATCTACAAGGACTGTGTT(G)G(A)TGGG-3')and (3'-GTCCGG(A)GCC(T)TGTGCCTGCCACTAA-5') (Table 3) designed on the basis of homology of already known BMP-6 genes of the different mammalian species (human, rat and mouse). In addition to 100 ng of reindeer antler cDNA and 40 pmol of each primers the 50 ul of PCR reaction mixture contained 0.4 mM dNTPs (PCR Core Kit, Roche) and 0.7 U/pl Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (thermostable Taq polymerase + proofreading polymerase, Roche) in Expand High Fidelity buffer with MgCb (Expand High Fidelity PCR System, Roche). The reaction was performed under the following program using Mastercycler personel apparatus (Eppendorf): initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes and 25 cycles of denatura-<br>
tion 94°C for 1 minute, annealing of the primers 55°C for 1 minute, elongation of DMA strands 72°C for 2 minutes. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 10 minutes.<br>

The PCR products were purified straight from the PCR reaction mix by Wizard® PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega) and ligated into the pGEM®-T vector (Figure 1) by T4 DNA Ligase (pGEM®-T Vector System I; Promega). 0.3 ug of purified PCR product and 2.3 µg/ml of pGEM®-T vector were added to ligation buffer containing 18 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.8), 6 mM MgCI2, 6 mM DTT, 0.3 mM ATP, 3% polyethylene glycol and 0.14 U/µl T4 DNA Ligase in total volume of 66 pi. The reaction was allowed to occur at +16°C water bath which was allowed to cool to +4 °C overnight. The newly formed plasmid was named as pMSU1(Figure 1).<br>
E The production of competent Escherichia coli TOP 10 F' cells<br>
The competent Escherichia coli TOP 10 F cells were produced by the calcium chloride/ magnesium chloride procedure. 2 ml of LB-medium was inoculated with<br>
E.	coli TOP 10 F cells and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Next<br>
morning 100 ml of fresh LB medium was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture<br>
and the culture was grown at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm) to an OD6oo of 0.5-0.6.<br>
The cultured cells were collected by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5 min), resuspended<br>
in 10 ml of 0.1 M MgCfe solution and collected again by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5<br>
min). After the MgCI2 treatment the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M<br>
CaCIa solution, incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes and recollected by centrifuga<br>
tion (2500 x g, 5 min). The CaCI2 treatment was repeated except that in the sec<br>
ond time 3.5 ml of CaCI2 was used and the Incubation time was 1 hour. Glycerol<br>
was added to suspension to final concentration of 14% (v/v) and the solution was<br>
divided into 200 ul portions. The competent E. coli TOP10 F' cells were frozen in<br>
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
F.	Transformation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP 10 F' cells and selection<br>
of clones containing reindeer BMP-6<br>
The competent Escherichia C0/iTOP10 F1 cells were melted in ice bath for 15 minutes. 20 µl of ligation mix (described above) was added to 100 pi of TCM (10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM CaCI2) 10 mM MgCI2) pH 7.0) and mixed with 200 ul of the competent E coli cells. The mixture was incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes before the heat shock (43°C, 3 minutes). After the heat shock 800 µl of LB medium was added and the cells were allowed to regenerate for 30 minutes at 37°C. The transformed cells were collected by centrifugation at top speed for 2 minutes and re-suspended to 30 µl of growth medium. The cell suspension was plated to two LB plates containing 25 µg/ml ampicillin covered with 1 mmol IPTG (isopropyl-3-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and 2.4 nmol X-gal (5-bromo-4-chioro-3-indolyl-p-D-gaJactoside) and the cells were grown at the plates overnight at 37°C. The positive clones were recognized by blue color formation based on a-comptementation of /acZgene. The method is described in detail in Sambrook and RusseJ (2001), Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.<br>
G. Isolation ofpMSUI plasmids and sequencing ofcDNA inserts<br>
The plasmids were isolated by Wizard® Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System<br>
(Promega) and then further purified by ethanol precipitation. The cDNA identity<br>
was confirmed by sequencing with ABI Prism (Perkin-Elmer Corporation). The se<br>
quencing reaction was performed using DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequenc<br>
ing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Mastercycler Personel apparatus (Ep-<br>
pendorf). The primers in the PCR reaction for<br>
sequencing	were	(5'-TMTACGACTCACTATAGGGCGA-3')	and<br>
(3'-ATTTAGGTAACACTATAGAATAC-5') (Table 4) and the program was as follows: 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing 50°C for 15 seconds, elongation for 60°C. The amplified PCR products were precipitated by ethanol precipitation method. In 10 µl reaction 1 µl of 1.5 M Na-acetate - 250 mM EDTA buffer and 95-100% ethanol was added so that the final ethanol concentration was 75%. The precipitation was allowed to occur in ice bath for 7 minutes and then the mixture was centrifuged for 20 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 125 µl of 70% ethanol in RT. The solution was centrifuged briefly and the washing ethanol was removed as precisely as possible. The pellet was dried in 37°C for a few minutes until all the ethanol was completely fumed. The ABI Prism apparatus was located in Department of medical biochemistry and molecular biology, University of Oulu, Finland and the final sequencing was performed there. The nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-6 is seen in figure 10.<br><br>

Example 2: Expression of the natural and nucleotide mutated recombinant reindeer BMP-6 mature part in Escherichia co/iTOP10 F', Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
A.	Amplification of the mature part of reindeer BMP-6 for expression vector<br>
The mature part of reindeer BMP-6 was amplified from the pMSU1 plasmid by PCR method using homology primers<br>
(5'-GGATCCGTCGGCCCCCGGGCGGCGCCGGCAG-3')and (3'-AAGCTTGTGGCAGCCACAGGCCCGGACGAC-5') and for nucleotide mutated mature part version (5'-GGATCCGTCGGCCCCGGGGCGCCGCCGCCAG-3') and (5'-AAGCTTGTGGCAGCCGCAGGCGCGGACGAC-3') (see Example 2 Part B). Primers are also seen in Table 3. There were recognition sites for restriction enzymes Bam HI and Hind III at the 5'- and 3'-end of primers respectively.<br>
In addition to 0.05 µg of pMSU plasmid and 40 pmol of each primers the 50 pi of PCR reaction mixtures contained 0.4 mM dNTPs (PCR Core Kit, Roche) and 0.7 U/µl Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (thermostable Taq polymerase + proofreading polymerase, Roche) in Expand High Fidelity buffer with MgCl2 (Roche). The PCR reactions were performed under the following program using Mastercycler personel apparatus (Eppendorf): initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes and 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 1 minute, annealing of the primers 55°C for 1 minute, elongation of DNA strands 72°C for 2 minutes. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were purified directly from the PCR reaction mixtures using Wizard® PCR Preps (Promega) and ligated to the pGEM®-T vectors. The newly formed plasmids with the natural and nucleotide mutated mature part of the reindeer BMP-6 were named as pMU2 and pMU8, respectively (Figure 1).<br>
B.	Subcloning of the natural and nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-<br>
6 from pGEIvP-T vector to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (Invitrogen) and trans<br>
formation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP 10 F', Origami B (DE3) and<br>
Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
The subcloning of the natural and nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 from pGEM®-T vector to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (Figure 2) was accomplished by first digesting the mature parts off from pGEM®-T vector using Bam HI and Hind III restriction enzymes and then ligating the inserts to pTrcHis 2A<br>
digested with the same enzymes. The Bam HI (Roche) and Hind\\\ (Roche) digestion of pGEM®-T constructs and pTrcHis 2A (1 ug) was performed in 10 pi of 10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCI2, 1 rnM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 (SuRE/Cut Buffer B, Roche) with 1 U/µl of each restriction enzyme. The reactions were allowed to occur for 1.5 hours in 37°C and then the restriction enzymes were inactivated by heating in 65°C for 20 minutes and freezing in -20°C. Ligation was performed in 2x Rapid Ligation Buffer (supplied with pGEM®-T vector by Promega) in +16°C water bath which was allowed slowly to cool down to +4°C overnight (li-gase concentration 0.1 U/ul).<br>
The newly formed constructs were checked by sequencing (protocol is described in Example 1 Part G) using primers (5'-AGAGGTATATATTAATGTATCG-3p) and (3'-ATGGTCGACGGCGCTATTCAG-5l) (Table 4). Expression vector containing pTrcHis 2A plus the natural reindeer BMP-6 mature part cDNA and pTrcHis 2A plus the nucleotide mutated reindeer BMP-6 mature part cDNA were named as pMU20 and pMU90, respectively (Figure 2). The competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells were transformed as described in Example 1 Part F and Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells were transformed following the instructions of the user manual shipped with the competent cells (Novagen).<br>
C. Nucleotide mutations to make the codons of the natural mature part of reindeer BMP-6 more suitable for Escherichia coli codon usage<br>
To get the highest expression possible, eight codons in the mature part of reindeer BMP-6 were mutated to more common ones in E. coli. The mutated codons coded amino acids P6, R8, R10, P99, P103, R132, R137 and C139 (Figure 5). Due to mutations the codon frequencies of used codons were raised dramatically (differences are described in Table 6). Mutations P6, R8, R10, R137 and C139 were performed using PCR technique (see Example 2 Part A) and mutations P99, P103 and R132 were performed after the mature part subcloning into pTrcHis 2A (see Example 2 Part B) by QuickChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) following the instructions of the kit manual. The oligos used in the mutations performed by the kit are shown in Table 5.<br>

The subcloning of the natural and nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 to the expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen) (Figure 3) was performed as described above (see Example 2 Part B). The newly formed plasmids containing pET22b(+) plus the natural reindeer BMP-6 mature part cDNA and pET22b(+) plus the nucleotide mutated reindeer BMP-6 mature part cDNA were named as pETrd6A and pETrd6, respectively (Figure 3). Transformations of Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells were performed as described above.<br>

E. coli cells [TOP10, Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3)] containing either pMU20, pMU90, pETrdBA or pETrdG were grown overnight in 50 ml of SOB medium containing ampicillin (50 µg/ml) and for Rosetta (DE3) cells also chloram-phenicol (35 µg/ml) in +37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Next morning 1200 ml of SOB medium, containing antibiotics mentioned above, was inoculated with 24 ml of overnight culture and incubated in +37°C with shaking (225 rpm) until ODeoo was 0.6 when the cells were in mid-log phase. At this point the recombinant protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration 1 mM. After the induction the cells were grown additional 4 to 5 hours and then collected by cen-trifugation. The amino acid sequences of the recombinant proteins produced with respective nucleotide sequences are presented in Figure 5 (pMU20/pMU90) and Figure 7 (pETrdSA/ pETrd6).<br>
Example 3: Purification and refolding of nucleotide mutated recombinant reindeer BMP-6 mature part<br>
A. Washing of inclusion bodies<br>
Collected cells were suspended in 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 220 g cells / 1 liter of buffer) by shaking. Suspension was centrifuged in 5,500 g for 45 minutes in +4°C. Washing with Na-phosphate was repeated once. Cell pellet was weighted and stored in -70°C overnight. Frozen pellet with partly erupted cells was thawed and suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer with 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 8.5, 25 mg/ml) by shaking 2 minutes. Suspension was centrifuged 26,000 g for 30 minutes in +4°C and Tris-HCi-EDTA washing was repeated once. The remaining pellet was weighted. In last washing step, pellet was suspended (200 rpm/minute, overnight, RT) in lysis buffer 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0, 35 mg/ml) when all the remaining intact £ coli cells are erupted and inclusion bodies made soluble. Suspension was centrifuged (26,000 g, 45 min, RT), pellet discarded and recombinant protein in soluble form in remaining supernatant Finally, to be sure to get rid of all cell remnants, supernatant was filtered through 45 filter.<br>
B.	Precipitation according to isoelectric point (pl)<br>
The nucleotide mutated recombinant reindeer BMP-6 expressed from pETrd6 in Escherichia coli Origami B (DE3) or Rosetta (DE3) cells was precipitated by isoelectric precipitation in pH 9.69. Isoelectric point was determined by computer calculations according to amino acid sequence of the recombinant reindeer BMP-6 (Figure 7). The precipitant was collected by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 30 min, RT) and resuspended in lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI; pH 8.0).<br>
C.	Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)<br>
Escherichia coll cells were lysed by shaking in 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0) for 2 hours and filtrated through 45 urn filter. In IMAC method, pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Columns were charged with Co2+, Cu2* or Ni2* ions according to instruction manual applied by supplier. The aid of the use of the his-tag-epitope at the end of the rdBMP-6 protein was that the his-tag-epitope bound up in the metal ion charged column and the impurities caused from E. coll cell debris flow through. After column charging, filtered supernatant from washing steps was applied in column. Majority of impurities was removed by washing the column with lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.0) 5-10 times bed volume. Second washing was performed with 5-10 times bed volume of buffer in which 6 M GuHCI of lysis buffer was replaced by 6 M Urea. Recombinant reindeer BMP-6 was eluted from the HiTrap column by pH gradient from pH 7.0 to pH 4.0 (6 M Urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing approximately pure rdBMP-6 were combined for refolding of recombinant protein.<br>
D.	Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-6 mature part<br>
The BMP-6 fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against water. After dialysis precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 8 M Urea, 0.1 M Tris/HCI, pH 8 in the presence of 100 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and incubated for 2 h at 25 degrees. The pH was lowered to pH 3-4 by drop wise addition of 1 M HCI. The DTT was removed completely by dialysis against 6 M urea, 10 mM HCI for 2 h at 25°C. Dialysis was continued at 4°C overnight against 6 M urea. Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-6 was performed by two-<br>
step dialysis. The first dialysis solution was 20 mM Tris-HCI - 150 mM NaCI - 3 M urea (pH 7.5). The dialysis buffer was changed at least six times during two to three days. Desalted sample was centrifuged and pellet was dried by lyophiliza-tion. At that point the purity of BMP-6 was 75% and its refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was 50%. Quantification of the refold dimer of recombinant reindeer BMP-6 on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels was done densitometri-cally.<br>
Example 4: Addition of heparin binding site in front of the mature part of the reindeer BMP-6<br>
A. Addition of heparin binding site coding DNA fragment to pTrcHis 2A vector<br>
Two complementary primers seen in Table 7 were designed using heparin binding site (HBS) of the reindeer BMP-2 as a model. Bam HI and Kpn I restriction sites were added in 5' and 3' ends of HBS, respectively. The primers were first denatured in +100°C for 5 min and then annealed by allowing a small +100°C water bath to cool down to room temperature and further to +4°C (1h). Both annealed HBS fragment (1 ug) and pTrcHis 2A vector (0.5 ug) were digested by Bam HI (1 U/ul) and Kpn I {2 U/ul) in Multi-Core buffer (Promega) in +37°C for 1.5 hours and ligated in +16°C water bath which was allowed to cool down to +4°C overnight. The newly formed construct was checked by sequencing (see Example 2 Part B) and named pTrcHBS (figure 2).<br>

(DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
For the addition of the natural and nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 to pTrcHBS, the mature part was amplified from pMSU1 {Figure 1). In the primers used there was Kpn I restriction site in the beginning of the 5' end primers and Hind III restriction site at the end of the 3' primers. The primers for amplification of the natural mature part of reindeer BMP-6 were (5'-GGTACCTCGGCCCCCGGGCGGCGCCGGCAG-3')and (5'-AAGCTTGTGGCAGCCACAGGCCCGGACGAC-3') and for the amplification of the nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 (5'-GGTACCTCGGCCCCGGGGCGCCGCCGCCAG-3')and (5'-AAGCTTGTGGCAGCCACAGGCCCGGACGAC-3').   The   primers   are   also shown in Table 3. PCR reactions, purification of PCR products and ligation reactions to pGEM®-T vector were performed as described in Example 1 Part C and D. pGEM®-T vector containing the natural mature part of reindeer BMP-6 was named pMU12 and pGEM®-T vector containing nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 was called pMU11. Both constructs are schematically presented in Figure 1,<br>
The subcloning of the nucleotide mutated mature part of reindeer BMP-6 from pGEM®-T vector to pTrcHBS was accomplished by the same way as the subcloning of same inserts into pTrcHis 2A described in Example 2 Part B. The only exception was that Bam HI was replaced by Kpn I and the buffer used was Muti-Core buffer supplied by Promega. Transformations were performed as described in Example 1 Part F and in Example 2 Part B. The new constructs were named pTrcHBSrd6A (natural mature part) and pTrcJHBSrde (nucleotide mutated mature part) (Figure 2) and both constructs were checked by sequencing (see Example 2 Part C).<br>

Example 5: Purification and refolding of nucleotide mutated recombinant reindeer BMP-6 mature part with heparin binding site (HBSrdBMP-6)<br>
A. IMAC purification for HBSrdBMP-6<br>
Escherichia coli cells were lysed by shaking in 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0) for 2 hours and filtrated through 45 pm filter. In IMAC purification method, pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Columns were charged with Co24, Cu2+ or Ni2+ ions according to instruction manual applied by supplier. Filtrated lysate was applied to the column and washed with 15 times the bed volume of lysis buffer. Second washing step was performed by 40 times the bed volume of 6 M Urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 7.5). In third washing buffer there was 0.05 M imidazole added into second washing buffer and the washing volume was 15 times the bed volume. Recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 was eluted from the column by imidazole gradient from 0.05 M to 500 mM in 6 M Urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate -0.5 M NaCI (pH 7.5). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing the most highly purified recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 were combined and dlalyzed against 100 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) over the weekend. Precipitated recombinant protein was colleted by centrifugation and solved in 8 M Urea -100 mM Na-phosphate - 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5). Before Heparin affinity column purification the recombinant protein solution was filtrated through 45 urn filter.<br>
B.	Heparin affinity column purification for recombinant HBSrdBMP-6<br>
Filtrate obtained after IMAC purification was applied in ready-to-use HiTrap Heparin HP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was balanced with 8 M Urea - 100 mM Na-phosphate - 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5). The column was then washed with 20 times bed volume of the same buffer and recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 was eluted from the heparin column by NaC! gradient from 0 M to 2 M also in the same buffer. The fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the highest purity of HBSrdBMP-6 were combined. In Western blot analysis specific antibodies against His6 and BMP-6 were used. Combined fractions were ready for refolding procedure.<br>
C.	Refolding of recombinant HBSrdBMP-6<br>
Refolding of recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 was performed as described in Example 3 part D for recombinant rdBMP-6.<br>
Example 6: The biological activity test of nucleotide mutated recombinant reindeer BMP-6 mature part with and without heparin binding site<br>
The biological activity of the lyophilized recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 was tested by implanting less than one mg of recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 absorbed into Lyostrypt® collagen sponge in mouse tight muscle pouches. After 21 days the hind legs were roentgenographed and the implant sites dissected and fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution. Fixed implants were cut into 4 urn sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Sections were examined with a light microscope.<br>
A new bone formation as an area and optical density was evaluated by radiographs. The radiographic images were transferred into a computer by using an optical scanner (HP Scan Jet, Hewlett Packard, USA). Ectopic and orthopic new bone formations were evaluated as the areas (mm2) of calcified tissue visible in the radiographs defined by using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp., USA) software. The mean optical density (mmAI) of the defined area was measured with the same equipment. Calibration of the optical density was performed by using an aluminum wedge (Al) with 0.25 mmAI steps, giving a calibrated density range up to 4 mmAI.<br>
As a comparison, the biological activity of recombinant human BMP-6 mature part produced by the same method was also tested using bioassay described above.<br>

CCGCGGCTCGGCCCCCGGGCGGCGC-31)	and	(S'-GGATCCTAGTG<br>
GCAGCCACAGGCCC-5') (Table 3) and the construct was named pMU2/2 (Figure 1). Primers for sequencing the construct were (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGA-3') and (3'-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-5') (table 4). In the amplification primers there were recognition sites for restriction enzymes Ksp I (Sac II) and Bam HI at the 5'- and 3'-end of primers, respectively and they were utilized in subcloning of the natural mature part of reindeer BMP-6. Plasmids pMU2/2 and pIVEX 2Ac (0.5 ug) were digested in 10 Ml volume of 10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM MgCI2l 1 mM dithioerythritol, pH 7.5 (SuRE Cut Buffer L, Roche) with 1 U/µl of each restriction enzyme. The restriction enzymes were inactivated before the ligation and the ligation reaction was performed as described in Example 2 Part C. The newly formed construct was named as pMUSOO (Figure 4).<br>

Construction of BMP-3c and BMP-4 vectors with heparin binding site (HBS)<br>
Kpnl restriction sites were created in front of the mature parts of rdBMP-3c/138, BMP-3c/110 and rdBMP-4 with PCR method (Example 2A). Templates in these reactions were BMP genes cloned previously in pTrcHis2A vector between BamH and Hind\\\ restriction sites. Primers (Sigma-Genosys) designed for these reactions are in table 8.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>

For the construction of HBS variants of rdBMPs above, the mature parts of reindeer BMP-3c/138, BMP-3c/110 and BMP-4 were amplified from cDNAs cloned in pTrcHis2A. After that all the mature parts were ligated into pTrcHBS (see the construction of pTrcHBS in Example 4, part A) and three different heparin binding site containing vectors were formed. They were named pTrcHBSrd3c/138, pTrcHBSrd3c/110 and pTrcHBSrd4.<br>
B. Expression, purification and refolding of pTrcHBSrd3c/138, pTrcHBSrd3c/110 and pTrcHBSrd4, in E. coli TOP10 produced proteins.<br>
Expression tests were done as described earlier (Example 2, part E). All of the three different BMP proteins were produced in TOP10 E. coli cells and the produced cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation. After that, the collected cells were first washed several times and erupted, lysed and finally filtered the soluble recombinant BMP proteins in inclusion body form to get the proteins free from cell remnants (see Example 3, part A).<br>
Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify the BMP proteins. Pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Biosci-<br>
ences) were charged with Co2*, Cu2+ or Ni2+ ions according to manufactures procedure. Filtered supernatant of reindeer recombinant proteins was applied in column. After washing the column several times (Example 3, part C) the most of the impurities was removed. The purified proteins were eluted from the column by pH gradient (Example 3, part C), analyzed by SDS-PAGE and used for the refolding experiments.<br>
For the refolding the fractions from HiTrap column were pooled and dialyzed against water. After dialysis precipitated protein was collected and resuspended in denaturing buffer (Example 3, part D). The pH was lowered to pH 3-4 and DTT was removed by dialysis. The refolding of recombinant reindeer BMPs with HBS was performed by two-step dialysis as described in Example 3, part D. The amounts of refolded proteins were defined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE.<br>
C. The biological activity test of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c and BMP-4 with heparin binding site<br>
The biological activity was tested by implanting recombinant BMP proteins absorbed into collagen sponge in mouse tight muscle pouches (see Example 6). EC-topic and orthopic new bone formation were evaluated as the areas (mm2) of calcified tissue visible in the radiographs defined by using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp., USA) software (Example 6).<br>
Results<br>
Cloning of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-6<br>
The nucleotide sequence obtained from ABI Prism reactions was analyzed with computer and it was compared to already known BMP sequences. Due to homol-ogy searches the newly cloned cDNA seemed to be most homological with bovine BMP-6 (nucleotide homology 95.0% and amino acid homology 99.1%). Nucleotide and amino acid homologies of BMP-6 proteins between mammalian species are presented in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of reindeer BMP-6 and the corresponding amino acid sequence of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-6 are shown in Figure 10.<br><br>
Expression of reindeer BMP-6 mature part<br>
First, the mature part of reindeer BMP-6 was cloned in pTrcHis2A vector and E co//TOP 10 cells were transformed by resulted pMU20 vector. Expression of re-combinant protein was induced by IPTG. Recombinant protein production was checked in SDS-PAGE, but no induction was observed. This was expected to be caused by several codons in rdBMP-6 which were rare for E coll codon usage. These codons were mutated to be more suitable for E. coli protein translation and plasmid pMU90 was created. Yet, when analyzed in SDS-PAGE no recombinant protein induction was still observed. It was concluded that this could possibly be caused by high GC content in the beginning of the rdBMP-6. It was also noticed that heparin binding site existing in the beginning of reindeer BMP-2 mature part had very low GC content and by adding it in front of reindeer BMP-6 mature part it could also be utilized as a part of the purification procedure. Therefore, pTrcHBS vector was constructed. By cloning the natural rdBMP-6 mature part and nucleo-tide mutated rdBMP-6 mature part in pTrcHBS the vectors pTrcHBSrd6A and pTrcHBSrd6 were obtained. Successful induction of both recombinant HBSrdBMP-6A and HBSrdBMP-6 was verified by SDS-PAGE but the expression level of nu-cleotide mutated HBSrdBMP-6 was significantly higher.<br>
Because there still was not the vector for producing the plain recombinant rdBMP-6 mature part it was decided to try another vector system with different E. coli cell lines. pET22b(+) (Novagen) with His6-tag and pelB leader was chosen as the new expression vector and Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) E. coli lines were chosen for expression. The natural and nucleotide mutated reindeer BMP-6 mature part was cloned with and without heparin binding site to pET22b(+) and four new plasmids were named as pETrdGA, pETrd6, pETHBSrd6A and pETHBSrd6 and both Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) cells were transformed with all of them separately. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, expression of rdBMP-6 or HBSrdBMP-6 was observed with every combination. Nevertheless, as described earlier with pTrcHBSrd6A and pTrcHBSrde, the nucleotide mutations in mature region caused dramatic increase in expression level when expressing either plain mature part of reindeer BMP-6 or manure part of reindeer BMP-6 with heparin binding site. Due to expression studies mainly Rosetta (DE3) cells with pETrd6 and pETHBSrd6 vectors were used in producing recombinant rdBMP-6 and HBSrdBMP-6, respectively.<br><br>
Purification ofrdBMP-6<br>
Recombinant reindeer rdBMP-6 protein was overexpressed in E. coll. After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies the content of recombinant reindeer rdBMP-6 was 85%.<br>
The next purification step was the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). After the elution of the column with pH gradient, the purity of rdBMP-6 measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75%. The isolated protein with the mature part of rdBMP-6 had a MW of 20,300 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Figure 11).<br>
Purification of rdBMP-6-HBS<br>
Recombinant reindeer rdBMP-6-HBS protein was overexpressed in E, coli and produced as inclusion bodies (IBs). After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies the content of recombinant reindeer rdBMP-6-HBS was 85%.<br>
The next purification step was the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). After the elution of the column with pH gradient, the purity of rdBMP-6-HBS measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75%. The isolated protein with the mature part of rdBMP-6-HBS had a MW of 21,600 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Figure 11),<br>
Refolding and activity tests of rdBMP-6 and rdBMP-6-HBS<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured rdBMP-6 and rdBMP-6-HBS protein was quantitated by measuring of the refold dimer of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels densitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by both proteins 50%.<br>
The osteoinductive activity induced by rdBMP-6 was increased in dose dependent manner (Table 2). When compared to its human counterpart the recombinant reindeer BMP-6 was proven to be more potent inducer of bone formation. The bone forming activity of reindeer BMP-6-HBS seemed to be in proportion to rdBMP-6 whereas bovine BMP-6 was responded only at the biggest amount studied.<br><br>
Refolding and activity tests of rdBMP-3c/138, rdBMP-3c/110, HBSrd3c/138 and HBSrd3c/110<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured rdBMP-3c proteins was quantified by measuring of the refold dimer of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels densitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by the rdBMP-3c proteins without HBS 50% and by the HBSrdBMP-3c over 70%.<br>
The osteoinductive activity induced by rdBMP-3c proteins without HBS was increased in dose dependent manner at least until 5 mg. When compared the biological activity of BMP-3C/138 to BMP-3c/110 it seemed, that BMP-Sc/110 was more potent inducer of bone formation. The fact, that refolding was 20% higher by the rdBMP-3c with HBS than without HBS, makes the HBSrdBMP-3c of great value (data not shown).<br>
Purification of HBSBMP-4 protein<br>
Recombinant reindeer HBSrdBMP-4 protein was slightly overexpressed in E. coll and produced as inclusion bodies (IBs). After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies, they were next purified with the affinity chromatography (IMAC and heparin). After the elution of the columns, the purity of HBSrdBMP-4 measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75%. The isolated proteins with the mature part of HBSrdBMP-4 had a MW of 17,700 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.<br>
Refolding and activity tests of HBSrdBMP-4<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured HBSrdBMP-4 protein was quantified by measuring of the refold dimer of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels densitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by HBSBMP-4 protein over 60%.<br>
HBSrdBMP-4 protein produced in E co/iTOP10 expression system showed biological activity when implanted in mouse tight muscle pouch. Furthermore, the refolding of the rdBMP-4 with HBS was significantly higher than without HBS, which makes the HBSrdBMP-4 of great value (data now shown).<br><br>
