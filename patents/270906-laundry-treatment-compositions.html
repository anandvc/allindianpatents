LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/093303<br><br>
PCI7EP2O07/OOO988<br><br>
- 1 -LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
5  The present invention relates to laundry treatment<br>
compositions with increased deposition of the dye to a substrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Garments comprising polyester fibres are ubiquitous. Many<br>
garments are white but over the lifetime of these garments<br>
the whiteness is dulled reducing the aesthetic value of the<br>
garment. There is a need to maintain the white appearance of<br>
15  such garments such that the aesthetic value is retained as<br>
long as possible.<br>
Bleach, fluorescers and shading agents are used in modern wash processes to maintain whiteness. The fluorescers and 20  shading agents that are currently available, do not deposit on polyester fibres of garments to a significant degree. All fibres may be subjected to a bleaching process but over time such treatment can lead to the garment taking a yellow hue.<br>
25  United States Patent 3,958,928 discloses a liquid dye composition together with methods for its use. The dye composition is a mixture of anthraquinone dyes suitable for use with liquid laundry detergents. The composition substantially reduces the undesirable fabric staining<br>
30  characteristic of a detergent in which the dye is employed, while still retaining the ability to blue the fabric. The composition is a combination of an oil soluble dye such as<br><br>
WO 2007/093303<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/000988<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
1,4-bis(2-ethylhexylamino)-anthraquinone (C.I. Solvent Blue 58) with a water soluble dye such as l-amino-2-sulfo, 4- (2-sulfo-para toluidino) anthraquinone sodium salt (C.I. Acid Blue 145) and/or  1,4-bis (3-sodium sulfonate mesitylidino) 5  anthraquinone (C.I. Acid Blue 80).  The dye disclosed has two eight carbon branched substituents. The dye  levels disclosed are above 0.0005% of the formulation. Long alkyl chains aid the incorporation of the highly hydrophobic dye in water surfactant compositions. Surprisingly a wide range 10  of disperse and solvent anthraquinone dyes without long<br>
alkyl chains are discovered which have much better function as shading dyes from homogeneous (isotropic) liquid laundry or granular formulations.<br>
15  USE3 6,521,581 discloses the use of anthraquinone dyes in a bi-phase (anisotropic) liquid detergent composition with high levels of coloured inorganic salts.<br>
There is a need to provide technology that maintains and 2 0  enhances the white appearance of polyester comprising garments.<br>
DE 2557783 discloses water soluble dyes and also discloses hydrophobic dyes disperse blue 87 and disperse blue 7 at a 25  level of 0.0001 wt%. Neither of these hydrophobic dyes is demonstrated as substantive to textiles.<br>
Co-pending application PCT/EP2005/009884 discloses laundry formulations containing hydrophobic shading dyes in the 30  range 0.0001 to 0.1 wt% which gives whitening benefits on synthetic fabrics. We have found that even lower levels of<br><br>

10<br>
JP 2004/210961, to Lion Corporation, discloses the use of anthraquinone dyes in a liquid detergent composition purely for enhancing the aesthetic appearance of the liquid detergent composition. The compositions comprise<br>
15  alkanolamine, an anionic surfactant and a non-ionic<br>
surfactant. In all the examples in JP 2004/210961 alcohol is present as a solubilising agent for the dye, i.e., 5 Wt % of ethanol is present. In some of the examples propylene glycol is also present to facilitate solubility of the dye.<br>
20<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dyes disclosed herein are known to be used to dye textiles in industrial processes conducted at high temperatures<br>
25  together with high concentrations of dyes and dispersion agents. Surprisingly the dyes can be used to shade at low levels of dye and surfactant and at routine laundry temperatures. We have found that not only are hydrophobic dyes are substantive to polyester fibres under normal<br>
30  domestic wash conditions but also at low levels of dye a<br>
shading whiteness benefit is provided. Benefits are provided<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
5<br>
Hydrophobic dyes are defined as organic compounds with a<br>
maximum extinction coefficient greater than 1000 L/mol/cm in<br>
the wavelength range of 400 to 750 nm and that are uncharged<br>
in aqueous solution at a pH in the range from 7 to 11. The<br>
10  hydrophobic dyes are devoid of polar solubilizing groups. In particular the hydrophobic dye does not contain any sulphonic acid, carboxylic acid, or quaternary ammonium groups. The dye chromophore is an anthraquinone dye chromophore.<br>
15<br>
Many examples of hydrophobic dyes are found in the classes of solvent and disperse dyes.<br>
Shading of white garments may be done with any colour 2 0  depending on consumer preference. Blue and Violet are<br>
particularly preferred shades and consequently preferred dyes or mixtures of dyes are ones that give a blue or violet shade on white polyester.<br>

transition metal catalyst may used with the peroxyl species. A transition metal catalyst may also be used in the absence of peroxyl species where the bleaching is termed to be via atmospheric oxygen, see, for example WO02/48301.<br>
2 5  Photobleaches, including singlet oxygen photobleaches, may<br>
be used with the laundry treatment composition.  A preferred photobleach is vitamin K3.<br>
FLUORESCENT AGENT<br>
30<br>
The laundry treatment composition comprises a fluorescent<br>
agent (optical brightener). We have found that the presence<br><br>

of a fluorescent agent enhances the deposition of the dye. Fluorescent agents are well known and many such fluorescent agents are available commercially. Usually, these fluorescent agents are supplied and used in the form of 5  their alkali metal salts, for example, the sodium salts. The total amount of the fluorescent agent or agents used in laundry treatment composition is from 0.005 to 2 wt %, more preferably 0.01 to 0.1 wt %. Preferred fluorescers are: sodium 2 (4-styryl-3-sulfophenyl)-2H-napthol[1,2-d]triazole,<br>
10  disodium 4,4'-bis{t(4-anilino-6-(N methyl-N-2 hydroxyethyl) amino 1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)]amino}stilbene-2-2' disulfonate, disodium 4,4'-bis{ [ (4-anilino-6-morpholino-l, 3,5-triazin-2-yl)]amino} stilbene-2-2' disulfonate, and disodium 4,4'-bis{2-sulfostyryl)biphenyl.<br>

PERFUME<br>
Preferably the laundry treatment composition comprises a perfume.  The perfume is preferably in the range from 0.001<br>
20  to 3 wt %, most preferably 0.1 to 1 wt %. Many suitable examples of perfumes are provided in the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) 1992 International Buyers Guide, published by CFTA Publications and OPD 1993 Chemicals Buyers Directory 8 0th Annual Edition, published by<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1 30  White Nylon Elastane French knickers  (65% polyamide,  33% elastane, 2% viscose gusset) were purchased from Marks and<br><br>

Spencers (UK) . The knickers were washed 20 times in a Brazilian top loading washing machine as part of a whites only load containing cotton, polyester and nylon. The L:C was 30:1, 2g/L of Brihlante™ washing powder was used and the 5 water temperature was ambient. The experiment was repeated but with the addition of varying levels of the dye solvent violet 13 to the washing powder. The dye was added via a zeolite/non-ionic (7EO) granule, which contained 0.25% by weight solvent violet 13 dissolved in the non-ionic. 10<br>
The build up of the dye on the fabric was monitored by measuring the reflectance of the fabric at 60 0nm. This was converted to the remission function K/S which is proportional to the dye loading on the cloth. K/S is 15  calculated using the equation<br>
K/S = 
To obtain a good visible whiteness benefits over control without dye   (corresponding to a colour change of 1 deltaE 30  points), required a total increase in K/S(600nm) of 0.009.<br><br>

From the above data the number of washes required to achieve this result may be obtained as given in the table below:<br><br>
5  Example 2<br>
Experiments were conducted to see how deposition to nylon and polyester fabrics varied with dosage of powder (2 and 6g/L); type of powder {Brihlante™ LAS/STPP based product and Persil Colour™ LAS/NI/Zeolite based product); and<br>
0  temperature {20 and 40 °C) .<br>
For solvent violet 13 deposition did not vary greatly with temperature for polyester but doubled for nylon. The two formula's behaved similarly. Increasing the powder dose 5  decreased deposition by about 30 to 40%.<br>
Example 3<br>
From the data in example 1 and 2, good benefits could be expected in the lifetime of the garment (2 years, wearing 0 once per week, 104 washes), for levels of 0.5 ppb at 20°C for Brihlante and 0.8 ppb solvent violet 13 in the wash liquor for Persil Colour type formulations. Raising the temperature by 20°C    doubles the deposition,  thus at 40°C,  levels of<br><br>

Experiments were performed to compare the relative performance, in terms of delivery to polyester fabrics in the wash from granular detergent formulations, of different anthraquinone dyes. Dyes without alkyl chains performed 5 better. The best performing dyes were disperse blue 56, disperse violet 26, disperse violet 28 and solvent violet 13.<br>

Example 5<br>
A standard fabric conditioner was created containing 5% of a C16 to C18 dialkyl quaternary salt and a fatty co-active. To this was added 0.005% of solvent violet 13. Washing 5  polyester and nylon cloth with this fabric conditioner at lOg/L showed clear deposition of the dye to the polyester. The example demonstrates that the dyes may be used at much lower levels than exemplified.<br>
10  Example 6<br>
A liquid detergent was formulated containing 3%LAS, 6% alcohol ethoxylate (9EO), 6% sodium lauryl sulfate (3EO) and 0.00002% solvent violet 13. The solvent violet was added via a concentrated non-ionic solution.<br>
15<br>
The 1.8 g/L detergent was used to wash a piece of white nylon-elastane (80:20)fabric with a L:C of 100:1 at ambient temperatures. The fabric was washed 10 times in this manner and compared to a control. The colour of the fabric was<br>
20  measured with a reflectometer and expressed as the L*, a*<br>
and b* values. The cloth washed in solvent violet 13 control has delta L*, delta a* and delta b* of -0.2, 0.2 and -0.9 respectively relative to the control. The decrease in b* reflecting a bluing of the cloth indicates the effective<br>
25  deposition of the dye.<br>
The level of dye in the wash solution is 0.36 ppb'. This examples illustrates that benefits from liquids may occur at lower wash numbers than powders. 30<br><br>

Example 7<br>
€5:35 pieces of woven polyester-cotton was washed in water containing 0.5 g/L SDS surfactant and 0.5g/L NaCl for 30 minutes at room temperature (2 0°C) . To this was added varying 5  levels of the fluorescers Tinopal CBS-X (ex Ciba Speciality Chemicals, Basel) and solvent violet 13. The solvent violet 13 was added with vigorous agitation from a 50 ppm ethanol stock solution.  After the wash the clothes were dried and their reflectance spectra recorded with uv light excluded 10  from below 420nm. The level of solvent violet 13 deposited to the cloth may be conveniently measured via the reflectance at 580nm.<br>
The results are shown in the table below, where the K/S 15  value at 580 nm is given.<br>
K/S = (1-R)2/(2R) and is proportional to the dye loading on the cloth.<br>
20  As expected the CBS-X does not significantly change the<br>
baseline value of K/S (580) as UV light i3  excluded and the molecules does not absorb or emit at this wavelength.<br><br>

The adsorption of solvent violet 13 to the cloth is clearly seen by the increase in K/S(580) . Surprisingly the adsorption increases as the CBS-X level is increased, so that there is more dye on the cloth. This is completely 5  unexpected as CBS-X deposits to the cotton fibres and solvent violet 13 to the polyester fibres in the cloth. The fluorescer makes the deposition of solvent violet 13 more efficient.<br>
