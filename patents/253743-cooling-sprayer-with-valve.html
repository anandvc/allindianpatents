COOLIISG   SPRAYER  WITH  VALVE<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns sprayers for cooling the pistons of an internal combustion engine, used to spray a cooling fluid such as oil against the piston bottom, i,e. against the piston face external to the combustion chamber,   or  into a piston  gallery.<br>
The piston cooling sprayers usually errployed are separate components fixed to the engine block and communicating with a cooling fluid feed orifice. The position of the sprayer is determined precisely to produce a jet of cooling fluid directed toward a precise area   of  the piston   bottom or  the piston  gallery.<br>
Cooling sprayers usually include a valve for inhibiting the flow of cooling fluid unless the pressure of the cooling circuit exceeds a particular threshold value.<br>
Sprayer structures are generally us ed in which the valve is urged by a compression spring toward a seat to block   a cooling fluid  passage.<br>
It has been found that certain cooling sprayers with a valve are satisfactory for a limited period, after which wear phenomena occur that interfere with the seal of the valve and its correct operation. The period of correct operation is inversely proportional to the nominal pressure of the cooling fluid in the cooling pipes. Wear modif i es mainly the opening charact eristics of the valve, i.e. the fluid pressure necessary to open it: when new, the valve opens at a correct nominal pressure; when worn, the valve opens at a lower pressure, which can be as low as half the correct nominal pressure, and thus below the idling regime of the engine. This results in interference with the general pressure of the fluid  in the engine.<br><br>
It has been observed that wear is inevitable if phenomena of oscillation and vibration of the valve occur.<br>
There is known from the document JP 07 317519 A an engine cooling sprayer the valve whereof is a piston urged against a s eat by a spring and sliding in an axial bore communicating with a radial fluid passage. The phenomena of vibration and wear are reduced- However, the piston-type sprayers of the document JP 07 317519 A have a relatively large overall size, and in particular a relatively long length downstream of the outlet orifices of the sprayer for guiding the piston. The sprayer body therefore constitutes a protuberance into the interior of the engine cylinder. Too great a length downstream of the outlet orifices of the sprayer leads to a risk of collision with the rotary elements of the motor such as the crankshaft or the crankshaft counterweight, and therefore rules out the use of such sprayers in c ertain engines.<br>
There is proposed in the document EP 1 273 774 Al a cooling sprayer structure that prevents vibration of the valve and at the same time reduces the overall size of the sprayer body inside the engine cylinder. In the first embodiment described in this document, the sprayer body comprises an axial passage through it in which are accommodated a tubular guide liner with an axial passage through it and a valve in the form of a piston cooperating with a main seat and a return spring. The sprayer body comprises an upstream section shaped to be connected to an engine cooling fluid feed passage. The sprayer body comprises an intermediate section having at least one radial outlet passage and one fluid outlet tube. The sprayer body finally comprises a downstream retaining section. The valve is mounted to slide axially in    an    upstream   liner    section   toward   and    away   from  the<br><br>
main seat and is urged axially toward the main seat by the return spring itself accommodated in the axial passage through the tubular guide liner. The tubular guide liner comprises an intermediate section that leaves a peripheral space for axial passage of fluid between its external surface and the internal surface of the axial passage through the sprayer body, for the fluid to pass between the  main  seat   and the radial   outlet   passage.<br>
In this document, the guide liner is engaged without clearance and retained in position in an upstream bore of the axial passage through the sprayer body, and is held axially between an upstream ring mount ed in the sprayer body and a downstream plug also mount ed in the sprayer body. A vent is provided in the downstream plug. The  main  seat   is  formed  in the guide liner.<br>
It   is   found   that   this   kind   of   sprayer   structure  is<br>
relatively       costly,	because       it        necessitates        the<br>
fabrication of several corrponents the dimensions whereof must be accurate for a satisfactory fit, and necessitates assembly of a relatively large number of corrponents. In particular, several corrponents such as the upstream ring, the downstream plug and the upstream guide liner section must be precision ground, as must the bores in which these corrponents engage without clearance. The result of this   is   a  high production cost.<br>
SUMMARY  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
The problem addressed by the present invention is that of designing a new cooling sprayer structure with a valve which avoids the phenomena of vibration and wear in operation, has a small overall size inside the engine cylinder, and corrprises a smaller number of corrponents that are themselves easier to produce, avoiding precise machining  operations  such  as  pre::ision  grinding.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects , the invention   proposes   a   piston   cooling   sprayer   for   internal<br><br>
combustion     engines,     including    a    sprayer     body    with    an axial    passage    through    it    in    which    are    accommodated    a tubular   guide   liner   with   an   axial   passage  through   it   and a   valve   that   cooperates   with   a    main    seat    and    a    return spring,     the    sprayer     body    having     an     upstream    section conformed   to   be connected   to   an   engine cooling  fluid   feed passage,   an   intermediate section  with  at   least   one radial outlet      passage     and      one     fluid      outlet      tube,      and     a downstream   retaining    section,     the    tubular    guide    liner being    fixed    coaxially   in    the   axial    through-passage   and having   an   upstream section   leaving   a   peripheral   space for the   axial   passage   of   fluid   between   its    ext ernal   surf ac e and   the internal   surface  of   the  axial   through-passage  and between   the   main   seat   and   the  radial   outlet   passage,   the valve   sliding   axially   in   the   axial   passage   through   the tubular   guide   liner   toward   and   away   from the   rrain   s eat and    being    urged    axially   t oward    the    rrain    s eat     by   the return    spring   accommodated   in   the   axial   passage   through the tubular  guide liner;   according to the invention:<br>
-	the rrain seat is formed in the rrass of the sprayer body by a  shoulder  in the axial through-passage,<br>
-	the tubular guide liner corrprises a downstream liner section fixed in the downstream retaining section of the sprayer   body beyond the radial   outlet  passage,<br>
-	the upstream section of the tubular guide liner terminates in an upstream end that is axially set back from the main seat, in the downstream direction, to define an annular fluid passage between the main seat and the peripheral  space.<br>
Because the tubular guide liner is held in the downstream retaining section of the sprayer body, it is no longer necessary to provide an upstream ring and a downstream plug to retain the guide liner axially. At the same time, there is no need for precision grinding of the upstream  bore  section   receiving  the  upstream ring   or   for<br><br>
precision   grinding   of   the   ext ernal   f ac e   of   the   upstream section   of  the tubular  guide liner.<br>
The downstream section of the tubular guide liner preferably corrprises an annular end flange crimped in a downstream section with a shoulder of the axial through-passage, in the downstream retaining section of the sprayer   body.<br>
With this arrangement, the tubular guide liner is fixed efficiently in the downstream section of the sprayer body, simply and quickly, by crimping, and it can be centred sufficiently accurately to guide the valve perfectly relative to the main seat and provide a good seal  upon closure of  the valve.<br>
In practice, the annular end flange can be retained in the downstream section with a shoulder of the axial through-passage by bending an end skirt of the sprayer body over the downstream end face of the annular end flange. As a result, the sprayer body can sirrply be fabricated by turning operations, producing in particular the  end  skirt.<br>
To improve the centring and retention of the upstream liner section facing the main seat, for efficient and accurate guiding of the valve, radial excrescences can be provided on the upstream liner section that centre the upstream liner section coaxially in the axial passage through the sprayer body by bearing on the wall of the axial through-passage. In this case, the downstream liner section is retained only by the annular end flange crirrped in the sprayer body retaining section. It is then possible to reduce the overall size of the sprayer body inside the engine cylinder by providing for the downstream section retaining the sprayer body to have a length just sufficient for accommodating and crimping the annular end flange of the tubular  guide liner,   beyond the radial  outlet  passage.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the presence of the radial excrescences between the upstream liner section and the wall of the axial through-passage can prove a problem if those radial excrescences are situated in the upstream section of the sprayer body, which section is intended to be forcibly introduced into the bore at the end of a cooling fluid feed passage of the engine block. In fact, during this forcible engagement, the radial stresses exerted on the downstream sprayer body section are transmitted to the tubular guide liner by the radial excrescences, and can slightly deform the tubular guide liner in the radial direction and int erf er e with free axial sliding of the valve in the tubular guide liner. To prevent this risk, it may be preferable to place the radial excrescences downstream of the downstream sprayer body section, or to choose another way of retaining and centring the tubular guide liner; the downstream section of the tubular guide liner can then further corrprise a centring section engaged in a corresponding bore of the axial through-pas sage, in the downstream retaining section   of  the sprayer   body.<br>
In all cases, the tubular guide liner can corrprise, in its axial through-passage, a downstream constricting shoulder against which is engaged a return coil spring urging the valve toward the rrain seat and continued by a vent. The liner therefore in itself constitutes the means for retaining the return spring, and the vent enables opening of the valve as soon as a low fluid pressure is present.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the tubular guide liner corcprises, from its upstream end, a guiding bore in which the valve slides with a small functional clearance and that is limited by a shoulder forming a rear seat against which the valve bears in sealed fashion when it is   pushed   back   by the fluid   under   pressure.    The presence<br><br>
of the rear seat prevents the passage of fluid toward the vent when the valve is pushed to the end of its stroke by the fluid   under  pressure.<br>
The rear seat is preferably disposed so that, when the valve is bearing on the rear seat, it frees a just sufficient section of the annular fluid passage for the required flow of the cooling fluid. As a result, the pressure from which the fluid urges the valve against the rear seat at the end of its stroke is significantly reduced, thereby again preventing the flow of fluid toward the vent,<br>

DESCRIPTION OF   THE   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
In all the embodiments shown in the figures, the internal combustion engine piston cooling sprayer includes a. sprayer body 1, a valve 2 or 2a, a return spring   3   and  a  tubular   guide  liner   4.<br>
This kind of cooling sprayer is intended to receive a cooling fluid via an upstream inlet 5 and to distribute that cooling fluid via downstream radial outlets such as the outlets 6 and 7. Thus there are defined an axial direction I-I and a direction of flow of the fluid from the upstream inlet  5  in the downstream direction.<br>
The sprayer body 1 as represented comprises an upstream section la, with a circular section cylindrical exterior surface, precision ground to be force-fitted in a sealed manner int o a bor e at the end of a cooling fluid f eed passage of the engine (not shown). Alt ernatively, instead of a precision ground external surface section, other known fixing means may be provided, for exarrple an attached  fixing  plate and   a  seal  provided   by an  0-ring.<br>
The sprayer body 1 comprises an intermediate section lb in which are provided a first radial outlet passage 8   and  a  second  radial  outlet  passage 9.<br>
The sprayer body 1 further comprises a downstream retaining section Ic the function of which is essentially to retain the tubular guide liner 4 as explained her einaf t er.<br>
A first outlet tube 10 is force-fitted into the first radial outlet passage 8 and forms the first outlet 6 of the sprayer. Similarly, a second outlet tube 11 is force-fitted into the second radial outlet passage 9, and forms  the second   outlet  7   of  the sprayer.<br>
In the figures, the out 1 et t ubes 10 and 11 are shown    as    rectilinear.     In   reality,    they   could    be   curved<br><br>
and shaped appropriately to direct the jets of the cooling fluid toward the appropriate areas of the piston or the cylinder   of  the  engine to  be cooled.<br>
The sprayer body 1 has an axial passage 12 through it in which are accommodated the tubular guide liner 4, the valve 2 and the return spring 3. The axial through-passage 12 communicates with the outlets 6 and 7 via the radial outlet passages 8 and 9 and the outlet tubes 10 and  11,<br>
Starting from the upstream inlet 5, the axial through-passage 12 comprises a cylindrical upstream section 12a of appropriate cross section for the required f low of cooling fluid and connected to an int er mediat e section 12b by a shoulder 12c a bevelled portion of which forms  the main  seat  13   of  the sprayer.<br>
The intermediate section 12b continues in the downstream direction beyond the radial outlet passages 8 and 9, and its downstream end is connected by a shoulder 12d to a cylindrical downstream section 12e of greater diameter in the downstream retaining section 1c of the sprayer   body 1.<br>
At its end opposite the upstream inlet 5, the sprayer body 1 terminates in an end skirt 14 the function of which is to retain the tubular guide liner 4, as described  her einaf t er.<br>
The tubular guide liner 4 has an axial passage 15 through it, open at both ends. From the upstream end 4a of the tubular guide liner 4, the axial through-passage 15 includes a guide bore 15a in which the valve 2 or 2a slides with a SMALL functional clearance and that is limited by a shoulder forming a rear seat 15b, Further on in the downstream direction, the axial through-passage 15 is continued in the axial direction and comprises a downstream constricting shoulder 15c against which the return   coil   spring   3   is    engaged,    and   which   is   continued<br><br>
by a  vent   21.<br>
Considering now the exterior surface of the tubular guide liner 4, there can be seen a generally cylindrical upstream section  4b and  a downstream section   4c.<br>
The upstream section 4b has an outside diamet er which is less than the inside diameter of the intermediate section 12b of the axial through-passage 12, therefore leaving a peripheral space 16 that enables axial passage of fluid from the main seat 13 as far as the radial outlet passages 8 and 9, Not e that the upstream end 4a of the tubular guide liner 4 is axially set back from the main seat 13 in the downstream direction, to define an annular fluid passage 17 between the  main  seat   13  and the peripheral  space 16.<br>
In all embodiments, the valve 2 or 2a is mounted to slide axially in the upstream section 4b of the tubular guide liner 4, i.e. in the guiding bore 15a of the axial through-passage 15. Thus the valve 2 or 2a slides toward and away from the main seat 13 and is urged axially toward the rrain seat 13 by the return spring 3 itself accommodated in the axial through-passage 15 of the tubular  guide liner   4.<br>
The downstream section 4c of the tubular guide liner 4 is fixed in the downstream retaining section Ic of the sprayer body 1, beyond the radial outlet passages 8   and  9,<br>
Several embodiments are described for the fixing and the centred retention of the tubular guide liner 4 in the sprayer body 1, In all cases, the downstream section 4c of the tubular guide liner 4 comprises an annular end flange 18 that is crirrped into the downstream section 12e with the shoulder 12d of the axial through-passage 12, in the downstream retaining section 1c of the sprayer body 1.<br>
In     practice,     the     annular     end     flange    18     bears<br><br>
axially on the shoulder 12d, is guided laterally in the downstream section 12e, and is retained in the downstream section 12 e with the shoulder 12d by bending the end skirt 14 of the sprayer body 1 over the downstream end f ac e of the annular end flange 18, The tubular guide liner 4 can therefore be assembled into the sprayer body 1 simply and quickly, without necessitating particularly precise machining. An end flange 18 can nevertheless be crirrped   by any other   appropriate crimping   means.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 3, and in the embodiment of figures 7 to 9, the downstream section 4c of the tubular guide liner 4 further comprises a centring section 19 engaged in a corresponding bore of the axial through-passage 12. In practice, the corresponding bore is provided in the int er mediat e section 12b of the axial through-passage 12, in the downstream retaining  section  Ic   of  the sprayer   body 1.<br>
In those same embodiments of figures 1 to 3 and 7 to 9, the tubular guide liner 4 is therefore retained only in the downstream retaining section Ic of the sprayer body 1. Its upstream section 4b is left free, without contact with the sprayer body 1, because of the exist enc e of the peripheral spac e 16 and the annular fluid passage 17, The means for retaining the tubular guide liner 4 nevertheless prove sufficient to achieve good centring of the valve 2 or 2a relative to the main s eat 13 in order to guarant ee a satisfactory s eal in the closed configuration.<br>
The presence of the peripheral spac e 16 and the annular fluid passage 17 guarantees that the upstream section 4 b and the tubular guide liner 4 will not be subjected to any radial stress liable to deform it and to int erfere with the free axial sliding of the valve 2 or 2a  in the tubular  guide liner   4.<br>
In  the variants   shown   in  figures   4  to 6   and   10,   the<br><br>
essential means of the previous embodiments as described with reference to figures 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 are found again, and thos e same means are identif i ed by the same reference numbers.<br>
In these variants of figures 4 to 6 and 10, the dif f er enc e lies in the means for retaining the tubular guide liner 4: in the downstream section 4c, the centring section 19 is dispensed with and replac ed, in the upstream section 4b, with radial excrescences 20, distributed at the periphery of the external surface of the upstream section 4b, and bearing on the wall of the axial through-pass age 12 in the sprayer body 1. In this case, the tubular guide liner 4 is retained on the one hand by crimping the annular end flange 18 and on the other hand by the bearing engagement of the radial excrescences 20 in the axial through-passage 12. Clearly the transverse excrescences 20 are favourable for achieving accurate centring of the valve 2 or 2a relative to the  main  seat   13.<br>
The two variants of the radial excrescences 20 shown in figures 5 and 6 can be used in each of the var i ant s   of  f i gur es   4   and  10.<br>
This dif f er ent structure of the retaining means for the tubular guide liner 4 leads to the possibility of reducing the overall size of the sprayer inside the cylinder of the engine. This reduction is seen if figures 3   and   4   or  figures   9   and  10   are compared,   for   example.<br>
In figure 3 or 9, the downstream end of the sprayer body 1 is at a distance D1 from the downstream edge of the radial  outlet   passages  8   or  9.<br>
Likewise, in figure 4 or 10, the downstream end of the sprayer body 1 is at a distance D2 from the downstream edge of  the radial   outlet  passages   8   or   9.<br>
The distanc e D2 is clearly much short er than the distance   Dl,    the   reduction    of    the   distance    being    rrade<br><br>
possible  in   figures   4   and   10    by   eli minating   the  centring section  19.<br>
To benefit from this reduced distanc e D2, the downstream retaining section 1c of the sprayer body 1 is given an axial length just sufficient for accommodating and crirrping the annular end flange 18 beyond the radial outlet  passages  8   and   9.<br>
In   the   embodiments    of   figures   1   to   4,    the   valve   2 is   a   piston   sliding   in   the   tubular   guide   liner    4,    This sliding   is    seen    on   considering   in   succession   figures   2 and   3:    in  figure 2,   the valve 2   is   in   a  closed   position, bearing   on  the  main   seat   13.    In   figure 3,   the  valve 2   is in    an    open    position,    away   from   the    main    seat    13,    and bearing   on   the   rear   seat    15b.     In   the   figure   3   position, by   bearing   on   the   rear   seat   15b   the   valve   2    is    able   to block   correctly the   axial   through-passage   15   and   thereby prevent   fluid   flowing   from the   main   seat    13   to   the   vent 21.    In  the case  of   a  valve 2   in  the form of   a   piston,   the presence  of   a  rear  seat   15b is  not   indispensable.<br>
In the embodiment of figures 7 to 10, the valve 2a is a ball, also sliding with a small functional clearance in the tubular guide liner 4. The sliding is visible on considering in succession figures 8 and 9: in figure 8, the valve 2a is in the closed position, bearing on the main seat 13. In figure 9, the valve 2a is in the open position, away from the main seat 13 and bearing on the rear  seat   15b.<br>
In both embodiments, the rear seat 15b is disposed axially so that, when the valve 2 or 2a is bearing on the rear seat 15b, it frees a just sufficient section of the annular fluid passage 17 for the flow of fluid. In practice, the passage left between the valve 2 or 2a and the main seat 13 can have substantially the same section as the subsequent fluid flow elements such as the peripheral  space 16.<br><br>
On the other hand, the annular fluid passage 17 and the diameter of the upstream section 12a of the axial through-passage are chosen so that/ when the valve 2a in the form of a ball is in the closed position (figure 8), the centre of the valve 2a in the form of a ball is further downstream of the upstream end 4a of the tubular guide liner 4, This achieves good lateral guidance of the valve 2a in the form of a ball in the tubular guide liner 4.<br>
The    embodiments    that    have    been    described    provide high   cooling   fluid   flow   rates,   with   a   limited   head   loss, which   tends   to   improve  the  perfomance   of   the   sprayer   by achieving  high  jet   speeds.<br>
As    seen    in    the   figures,     a    sprayer    can    cool    more than   one  piston   at   a  time,   in   particular   in   V   engines   by providing    multiple    outlet    tubes    such    as    the   tubes    10 and   11.<br>
The small overall axial size of the sprayer enables its  use in   most  very corrpact   modern   engines.<br>
The simplicity and the small number of components significantly reduce the fabrication  cost   of   the sprayer.<br>
The sprayer as described can be fixed by force-fitting the sprayer body into the engine block, without risk   of   jamming the valve.<br>
The dimensions of the various corrponents and cooling fluid passages will be chosen to satisfy the flow rate specification. The materials can be chosen to satisfy the specifications.<br>
In practice, the various components can be made of metal.<br>
Alternatively, the tubular guide liner 4 can be moulded  from plastic   material.<br>
The presence of the rear seat 15b protects the return spring 3 by limiting its compression, immobilises the valve 2   or  2a  when  the stroke necessary to  obtain  the<br><br>
required rraximum flow rat e is reached, and limits leaks through the vent 21 when the cooling fluid is present at high pressura The particular position of the rear seat 15b, which immobilises the valve 2 or 2a as soon as the stroke necessary for obtaining the required maximum flow rate is reached, limits leaks to the vent 21 as soon as a relatively low  pressure is   reached.<br>
