DESCRIPTION<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to antennas and, more<br>
particularly, to a small surface-mountable broadband antenna.'<br>
Background Art<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a helical antenna as a compact<br>
antenna used in mobile telecommunication, for example, mobile<br>
phones. In the helical antenna disclosed in Patent Document 1,<br>
an excitation coil is helically wound around a long and narrow<br>
insulative main body, and first and second non-feeding coils are<br>
helically wound around the main body so as to be adjacent to the<br>
excitation coil. Thereby, the helical antenna is capable of<br>
operating in two frequency bands.<br>
However, the two frequency bands within which the helical<br>
antenna can operate are apart from each other by at least<br>
several hundred megahertz, and it is not possible to set the<br>
spacing between the two frequency bands to 100 MHz or less. In<br>
addition, a sufficiently broad band width cannot be achieved<br>
although the bandwidth of each frequency band is wider than the<br>
bandwidth of a helical antenna having a single coil.<br>

Publication No. 2003-37426, published on 7th February 2003,<br>
pertaining to Japanese patent application number 2001-224073,<br>
titled "MULTI-FREQUENCY HELICAL ANTENNA", filed by Nippon<br>
Antenna Co. Ltd.<br><br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a small<br>
antenna in which a broad band is achieved.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
In order to achieve the above object, a first invention<br>
provides an antenna including a feed terminal and at least two<br>
inductance elements having different inductance values. The<br>
inductance elements are used for radiation of electromagnetic<br>
waves. The inductance elements are used as the inductances of a<br>
matching circuit for matching an impedance of a device to be<br>
connected to the feed terminal and a radiation impedance of free<br>
space.<br>
In the antenna according to the first invention, the use of<br>
the at least two inductance elements having different inductance<br>
values as the inductances of the matching circuit allows the<br>
impedance of the device connected to the feed terminal to be<br>
matched with the space impedance 377Ω in a substantially broad<br>
band. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a small antenna<br>
having a broad band, and the antenna may be a surface-mountable<br>
antenna.<br>
A second invention provides an antenna including a feed<br>
terminal and a plurality of resonant circuits. The plurality of<br>
resonant circuits are used for radiation of electromagnetic<br>
waves. The plurality of resonant circuits are used as a<br>
matching circuit for matching an impedance of a device to be<br>
connected to the feed terminal and a radiation impedance of free<br><br>
space.<br>
In the antenna according to the second invention, by using<br>
the inductance components of the plurality of resonant circuits<br>
for the radiation of electromagnetic waves as the inductance of<br>
the matching circuit, the impedance of a device connected to the<br>
feed terminal can be matched with the space impedance 377Ω in a<br>
substantially broad band. Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
realize a small antenna having a broad band, and the antenna may<br>
be a surface-mountable antenna.<br>
According to the second invention, each of the plurality of<br>
resonant circuits may include a capacitance element and an<br>
inductance element. In this case, it is preferred that the<br>
plurality of resonant circuits be electrically connected to the<br>
feed terminal directly or via a lumped constant capacitance or<br>
inductance. The coupling coefficient between adjacent resonant<br>
circuits among the plurality of resonant circuits preferably has<br>
a value of at least 0.1.<br>
The inductance element in each resonant circuit may be<br>
composed of linear electrode patterns arranged in a direction of<br>
one axis. It is preferred that the capacitance element be<br>
electrically connected to the feed terminal to prevent surge.<br>
By forming the capacitance element on a multilayer substrate,<br>
the capacitance element does not impair the reduction in size<br><br>
of the antenna. By forming the plurality of resonant circuits<br>
on a multilayer substrate, the antenna can be manufactured in<br>
a small size, and the multilayer process facilitates the<br>
manufacturing of small antennas.<br>
A third invention provides an antenna including first and<br>
second feed terminals and a plurality of resonant circuits.<br>
The antenna includes a first LC series resonant circuit<br>
comprising a first inductance element and first and second<br>
capacitance elements, the first capacitance element being<br>
electrically connected to one end of the first inductance<br>
element and the second capacitance element being electrically<br>
connected to the other end of the first inductance element,<br>
and a second LC series resonant circuit comprising a second<br>
inductance element and third and fourth capacitance elements,<br>
the third capacitance element being electrically connected to<br>
one end of the second inductance element and the fourth<br>
capacitance element being electrically connected to the other<br>
end of the second inductance element. The first inductance<br>
element is magnetically coupled to the second inductance<br>
element. One end of the first inductance element is<br>
electrically connected to the first feed terminal via the<br>
first capacitance element, and the other end thereof is<br>
electrically connected to the second feed terminal via the<br>
second capacitance element. One end of the second inductance<br>
element is electrically connected to the first feed terminal<br><br>
via the third and first capacitance elements, and the other<br>
end thereof is electrically connected to the second feed<br>
terminal via the fourth and second capacitance elements.<br>
In the antenna according to the third invention, the<br>
first and second LC series resonant circuits are used for the<br>
radiation of electromagnetic waves, the first and second<br>
inductance elements function as the inductances of the<br>
matching circuit, and the impedance of a device connected<br>
between the first and second feed terminals can be matched<br>
with the space impedance 377Ω in a substantially broad band.<br>
In addition, the elements can be easily layered to realize a<br>
small surface-mountable antenna having a broad band.<br>
Advantages<br>
According to the present invention, the impedance of a<br>
device connected to the feed terminal can be matched with the<br>
space impedance 377Ω in a substantially broad band in the<br>
plurality of inductance elements or the plurality of resonant<br>
circuits used for radiation of electromagnetic waves.<br>
Accordingly, it is not necessary to separately provide the<br>
matching circuit, thus realizing a small antenna having a<br>
broad band.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of an antenna according to the present<br>
invention will herein be described with reference to the<br>
attached drawings.<br>
(First Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 1 to 6)<br>
An antenna 1A according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention include inductance elements L1 and L2 having<br>
different inductance values and magnetically coupled to each<br>
other in phase (indicated by a mutual inductance M), as shown as<br>
an equivalent circuit in Fig. 1. The inductance element L1 is<br>
connected to feed terminals 5 and 6 via capacitance elements Cla<br>
and Clb, respectively, and is connected in parallel to the<br>
inductance element L2 via capacitance elements C2a and C2b. In<br>
other words, this resonant circuit includes an LC series<br>
resonant circuit composed of the inductance element L1 and the<br>
capacitance elements C1a and C1b and an LC series resonant<br>
circuit composed of the inductance element L2 and the<br>
capacitance elements C2a and C2b.<br>
The antenna 1A having the above circuit configuration has,<br><br>
for example, a layered structure shown in Fig. 2. Ceramic<br>
sheets 11a to 11i made of dielectric material are layered,<br>
press-bonded, and fired to form the antenna 1A. Specifically,<br>
the sheet 11a has the feed terminals 5 and 6 and via-hole<br>
conductors 19a and 19b formed thereon. The sheet 11b has<br>
capacitor electrodes 12a and 12b formed thereon. The sheet<br>
11c has capacitor electrodes 13a and 13b and via-hole<br>
conductors 19c and 19d formed thereon. The sheet 11d has<br>
capacitor electrodes 14a and 14b, the via-hole conductors 19c<br>
and 19d, and via-hole conductors 19e and 19f formed thereon.<br>
Furthermore, the sheet 11e has connection conductor<br>
patterns 15a, 15b, and 15c, the via-hole conductor 19d, and<br>
via-hole conductors 19g, 19h, and 19i formed thereon. The<br>
sheet 11f has conductor patterns 16a and 17a, the via-hole<br>
conductors 19g and 19i, and via-hole conductors 19j and 19k<br>
formed thereon. The sheet 11g has conductor patterns 16b and<br>
17b and the via-hole conductors 19g, 19i, 19j, and 19k formed<br>
thereon. The sheet 11h has conductor patterns 16c and 17c and<br>
the via-hole conductors 19g, 19i, 19j, and 19k formed thereon.<br>
The sheet Hi has conductor patterns 16d and 17d formed<br>
thereon.<br>
Layering the above sheets 11a to 11i causes the conductor<br>
patterns 16a to 16d to be connected to each other via the via-<br>
hole conductor 19 j to form the inductance element L1 and<br>
causes the conductor patterns 17a to 17d to be connected to<br><br>
each other via the via-hole conductor 19k to form the<br>
inductance element L2. The capacitance element C1a is<br>
composed of the electrodes 12a and 13a, and the capacitance<br>
element C1b is composed of the electrodes 12b and 13b. The<br>
capacitance element C2a is composed of the electrodes 13a and<br>
14a, and the capacitance element C2b is composed of the<br>
electrodes 13b and 14b.<br>
One end of the inductance element L1 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 13a via the via-hole conductor 19g, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15c, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19c. The other end of the inductance element L1 is connected<br>
to the capacitor electrode 13b via the via-hole conductor 19d.<br>
One end of the inductance element L2 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 14a via the via-hole conductor 19i, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15a, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19e. The other end of the inductance element L2 is connected<br>
to the capacitor electrode 14b via the via-hole conductor 19h,<br>
the connection conductor pattern 15b, and the via-hole<br>
conductor 19f.<br>
The feed terminal 5 is connected to the capacitor<br>
electrode 12a via the via-hole conductor 19a, and the feed<br>
terminal 6 is connected to the capacitor electrode 12b via the<br>
via-hole conductor 19b.<br>
In the antenna 1A having the above configuration, the LC<br>
series resonant circuits, which include the inductance<br><br>
elements L1 and L2 magnetically coupled to each other, resonate<br>
to cause the inductance elements L1 and L2 to function as a<br>
radiation element. In addition, the coupling between the<br>
inductance elements L1 and L2 via the capacitance elements C2a<br>
and C2b forms a matching circuit matching the impedance (usually<br>
50Ω) of a device connected between the feed terminals 5 and 6<br>
with the space impedance (377Ω).<br>
A coupling coefficient k between the adjacent inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 is represented by k2 = M2/(L1xL2) . The<br>
coupling coefficient k is preferably equal to or greater than<br>
0.1, and in the first embodiment, the coupling coefficient k is<br>
about 0.8975. The inductance values of the inductance elements<br>
L1 and L2 and the degree of the magnetic coupling (the mutual<br>
inductance M) between the inductance elements L1 and L2 are set<br>
so that a desired bandwidth can be obtained. In addition, since<br>
the LC resonant circuits composed of the capacitance elements<br>
C1a, C1b, C2a and C2b and the inductance elements L1 and L2 are<br>
constructed as a lumped constant resonant circuit, the circuits<br>
can be manufactured in a small size as a layered type, and the<br>
circuits are less likely to be affected by other elements.<br>
Furthermore, since the connection to the feed terminals 5 and 6<br>
is performed via the capacitance elements Cla and Clb, a surge<br>
in lower frequencies is prevented, and it is possible to protect<br>
the device from the surge.<br>
Since the multiple LC series resonant circuits are formed<br>
on the multilayer substrate, the LC series resonant circuits can<br>
be manufactured as a small antenna that can be surface-mounted<br>
on the substrate of, for example, a mobile phone. The antenna<br><br>
1A can also be used as the antenna for a wireless IC device used<br>
in a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system.<br>
As a result of a simulation performed by the inventor based<br>
on the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 1, the antenna 1A<br>
exhibited reflection characteristics shown in Fig. 3. As<br>
apparent from Fig. 3, the center frequency was 760 MHz and the<br>
antenna 1A exhibited reflection characteristics of -10 dB or<br>
less in a broad band from 700 MHz to 800 MHz. The reason why<br>
reflection characteristics were obtained in a broad band will be<br>
described in detail below in a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the directivity of the antenna 1A. Fig. 5<br>
shows the directivity in an X-Y plane. The X, Y, and Z axes in<br>
Fig. 5 correspond to arrows X, Y, and Z in Figs. 2 and 4. Fig.<br>
6 is a Smith chart showing the impedance of the antenna 1A.<br>
(Second Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 7 to 10)<br>
An antenna 1B according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes inductance elements L1 and L2 having<br>
different inductance values and magnetically coupled to each<br>
other in phase (indicated by a mutual inductance M), as<br><br><br>
shown as an equivalent circuit in Fig. 7. One end of the<br>
inductance element L1 is connected to a feed terminal 5 via a<br>
capacitance element C1 and is connected to the inductance<br>
element L2 via a capacitance element C2. The other ends of<br>
the inductance elements L1 and L2 are directly connected to a<br>
feed terminal 6. In other words, this resonant circuit<br>
includes an LC series resonant circuit composed of the<br>
inductance element L1 and the capacitance element C1 and an LC<br>
series resonant circuit composed of the inductance element L2<br>
and the capacitance element C2. The capacitance elements C1b<br>
and C2b in the antenna 1A according to the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention are not provided in the antenna 1B. The<br>
inductances of the inductance elements L1 and L2 and the level<br>
of magnetic coupling (the mutual inductance M) between the<br>
inductance elements L1 and L2 are set so as to provide a<br>
desired bandwidth.<br>
The antenna 1B having the above circuit configuration has,<br>
for example, a layered structure shown in Fig. 8. Ceramic<br>
sheets 11a to 11i made of dielectric material are layered,<br>
press-bonded, and fired to form the antenna 1B. Specifically,<br>
the sheet 11a has the feed terminals 5 and 6 and via-hole<br>
conductors 19a and 19b formed thereon. The sheet 11b has a<br>
capacitor electrode 12a and a via-hole conductor 19m formed<br>
thereon. The sheet 11c has a capacitor electrode 13a, a via-<br>
hole conductor 19c, and the via-hole conductor 19m formed<br><br>
thereon. The sheet 11d has a capacitor electrode 14a, the<br>
via-hole conductors 19c and 19m, and a via-hole conductor 19e<br>
formed thereon.<br>
Furthermore, the sheet 11e has connection conductor<br>
patterns 15a, 15b, and 15c and via-hole conductors 19d, 19g,<br>
19h, and 19i formed thereon. The sheet 11f has conductor<br>
patterns 16a and 17a, the via-hole conductors 19g and 19i, and<br>
via-hole conductors 19j and 19k formed thereon. The sheet 11g<br>
has conductor patterns 16b and 17b and the via-hole conductors<br>
19g, 19i, 19j, and 19k formed thereon. The sheet 11h has<br>
conductor patterns 16c and 17c and the via-hole conductors 19g,<br>
19i, 19j, and 19k formed thereon. The sheet 11i has conductor<br>
patterns 16d and 17d formed thereon.<br>
Layering the above sheets 11a to 11i causes the conductor<br>
patterns 16a to 16d to be connected to each other via the via-<br>
hole conductor 19 j to form the inductance element L1 and<br>
causes the conductor patterns 17a to 17d to be connected to<br>
each other via the via-hole conductor 19k to form the<br>
inductance element L2. The capacitance element C1 is composed<br>
of the electrodes 12a and 13a. The capacitance element C2 is<br>
composed of the electrodes 13a and 14a.<br>
One end of the inductance element L1 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 13a via the via-hole conductor 19g, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15c, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19c. The other end of the inductance element L1 is connected<br><br>
to the feed terminal 6 via the via-hole conductor 19d, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15b, and the via-hole conductors<br>

feed terminal 5 via the via-hole conductor 19a.<br>
One end of the inductance element L2 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 14a via the via-hole conductor 19i, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15a, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19e. The other end of the inductance element L2 is connected<br>
to the feed terminal 6 via the via-hole conductor 19h, the<br>

19m and 19b. The other end of the inductance element L1 is<br>
connected to the other end of the inductance element L2 via<br>
the connection conductor pattern 15b.<br>
In the antenna 1B having the above configuration, the LC<br>
series resonant circuits, which include the inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 magnetically coupled to each other,<br>
resonate to cause the inductance elements L1 and L2 to<br>
function as a radiation element. In addition, the coupling<br>
between the inductance elements L1 and L2 via the capacitance<br>
element C2 forms a matching circuit matching the impedance<br>
(usually 50Ω) of a device connected between the feed terminals<br>
5 and 6 with the space impedance (377Ω) .<br>
As a result of a simulation performed by the inventor<br>
based on the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7, the antenna <br>
1B exhibited reflection characteristics shown in Fig. 9.<br><br>
The reason why the antenna 1B according to the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention has reflection characteristics in a<br>
broad band is now described in detail. Fig. 10(A) shows the<br>
circuit configuration of the antenna 1B. Fig. 10(B) shows a<br>
circuit configuration in which a π circuit portion including the<br>
inductance element L1, the capacitance element C2, and the<br>
inductance element L2 in Fig. 10(A) is transformed into a T<br>
circuit. Referring to Fig. 10(B), if L1<l2 l1-m because of></l2>
the value of the mutual inductance M. If L1-M = 0, the circuit<br>
shown in Fig. 10(B) can be transformed into a circuit shown in<br>
Fig. 10(C). If L1-M 
in Fig. 10(C) is changed to a capacitance C2' . The circuit in<br>
Fig. 10(C) resulting from the circuit transformation includes a<br>
series resonant circuit composed of the capacitance C1 and the<br>
mutual inductance M and a parallel resonant circuit composed of<br>
the capacitance C2 and the inductance L2-M. Increasing the<br>
spacing between the resonant frequencies of the resonant<br>
circuits broadens the bandwidth, and a broad band can be<br>
achieved. The bandwidth is appropriately set via the resonant<br>
frequencies, that is, the values of L1, L2 and M.<br>

capacitor electrode 52a, a conductor pattern 56a, and a via-<br>
hole conductor 59c formed thereon. The sheet 51c has a<br>
capacitor electrode 52b, a conductor pattern 56b, and via-hole<br>
conductors 59c and 59d formed thereon.<br>
Furthermore, the sheet 51d has conductor patterns 53 and<br>
56c, the via-hole conductor 59c, and a via-hole conductor 59e<br>

has a conductor pattern 55 formed thereon. One end of the<br>
conductor pattern 55 serves as a conductor pattern 56g.<br>
Layering the above sheets 51a to 51h causes the conductor<br>
pattern 53 to be formed as the inductance element L1 and causes<br>
the conductor pattern 55 to be formed as the inductance element<br>
L2. The conductor patterns 56a to 56g are connected via the<br>
via-hole conductor 59c to form the inductance element L3. The<br>
capacitance element C1 is composed of the electrodes 52a and<br>

hole conductor 59a.<br>
In the antenna 1F having the above configuration, the LC<br>
series resonant circuits, which include the inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 magnetically coupled to each other,<br>

function as a radiation element. In addition, the magnetic<br>
coupling between the inductance elements L1 and L2 forms a<br>
matching circuit matching the impedance (usually 50Ω) of a<br>
device connected between the feed terminals 5 and 6 with the<br>
space impedance (377Ω) .<br>
In the antenna 1F, a broad band is ensured even when the<br>
magnetic coupling between the inductance elements L1 and L2 is<br>
weak, because the inductance element L1 is directly connected<br>
to the inductance element L2. In addition, since the other<br>
ends of the inductance elements L1 and L2 are connected to the<br>
feed terminal 6 via the inductance element L3, the coupling<br>
coefficient k between the inductance elements L1 and L2 can be<br>
increased. Furthermore, the addition of the inductance<br>
element L3 can realize a broad band even if the coupling<br>
coefficient between the inductance elements L1 and L2 is small<br>

feed terminals 5 and 6 is restricted by the configuration.<br>
(Eighth Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 24 and 25)<br>
An antenna 1H according to an eighth embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a configuration which includes the<br>
inductance elements L1 and L2 according to the seventh<br>
embodiment of the present invention and a capacitance element <br>
C1 connected between one end of the inductance element L1 and<br>
the feed terminal 5, as shown as an equivalent circuit in Fig.<br>
24.<br>
Also in the antenna 1H having the above circuit<br>
configuration, the magnetic coupling between the inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 having different inductance values causes a<br>
mutual inductance M. According to a simulation performed by<br>
the inventor, as shown by Fig. 25, the antenna 1H has<br>
reflection characteristics in a broad band.<br>
(Ninth Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 26 and 27)<br>
An antenna 1I according to a ninth embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a configuration which includes the<br><br><br>
inductance elements L1 and L2 according to the seventh<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a capacitance element C1<br>
connected between one end of the inductance element L1 and the<br>
feed terminal 5, and a capacitance element C2 connected<br>
between one end of the inductance element L2 and the feed<br>
terminal 5, as shown as an equivalent circuit in Fig. 26.<br>
Also in the antenna 1I having the above circuit<br>
configuration, the magnetic coupling between the inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 having different inductance values causes a<br>
mutual inductance M. According to a simulation performed by<br>
the inventor, as shown by Fig. 27, the antenna 1I has<br>
reflection characteristics in a broad band.<br>
(Tenth Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 28 to 30)<br>
An antenna 1J according to a tenth embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a configuration in which a so-called mid<br>
tap is provided for the inductance element L1 according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention and the feed<br>
terminal 5 is connected to the mid tap, as shown as an<br>
equivalent circuit in Fig. 28. The capacitance element C1 is<br>
not provided in the antenna 1J.<br>
The same operations and advantages as those in the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention are offered in the tenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. By providing the mid tap,<br>
the space impedance and the impedance of a device connected<br>
between the feed terminals 5 and 6 can be matched without<br><br>
reducing the electromagnetic field energy. The inductance<br>
element L1 is divided into inductances L1a and L1b.<br>
The antenna 1J having the above circuit configuration has,<br>
for example, a layered structure shown in Fig. 29. Ceramic<br>
sheets 11a to 11h made of dielectric material are layered,<br>
press-bonded, and fired to form the antenna 1J. Specifically,<br>
the sheet 11a has the feed terminals 5 and 6 and via-hole<br>
conductors 19a and 19b formed thereon. The sheet 11b has a<br>
capacitor electrode 13a, a connection conductor pattern 15d,<br>
and via-hole conductors 19c, 19m, and 19n formed thereon. The<br>
sheet 11c has a capacitor electrode 14a, the via-hole<br>
conductors 19c, 19m, and 19n, and a via-hole conductor 19e<br>
formed thereon.<br>
Furthermore, the sheet 11d has connection conductor<br>
patterns 15a, 15b, and 15c, the via-hole conductor 19n, and<br>
via-hole conductors 19d, 19g, 19h, and 19i formed thereon.<br>
The sheet 11e has conductor patterns 16a and 17a, the via-hole<br>
conductors 19g, 19i and 19n, and via-hole conductors 19j and<br>
19k formed thereon. The sheet 11f has conductor patterns 16b<br>
and 17b and the via-hole conductors 19g, 19i, 19j, 19k, and<br>
19n formed thereon. The sheet 11g has conductor patterns 16c<br>
and 17c and the via-hole conductors 19g, 19i, 19j, and 19k<br>
formed thereon. The sheet 11h has conductor patterns 16d and<br>
17d formed thereon.<br>
Layering the above sheets 11a to 11h causes the conductor<br><br>
patterns 16a to 16d to be connected to each other via the via-<br>
hole conductor 19j to form the inductance element L1, causes a<br>
branch 16c' of the conductor pattern 16c to function as the<br>
tap, and causes the branch 16c' to be connected to the feed<br>
terminal 5 via the via-hole conductor 19n, the connection<br>
conductor pattern 15d, and the via-hole conductor 19a. In<br>
addition, the conductor patterns 17a to 17d are connected to<br>
each other via the via-hole conductor 19k to form the<br>
inductance element L2. The capacitance element C2 is composed<br>
of the electrodes 13a and 14a.<br>
One end of the inductance element L1 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 13a via the via-hole conductor 19g, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15c, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19c. The other end of the inductance element L1 is connected<br>
to the feed terminal 6 via the via-hole conductor 19d, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15b, and the via-hole conductors<br>
19m and 19b.<br>
One end of the inductance element L2 is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 14a via the via-hole conductor 19i, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15a, and the via-hole conductor<br>
19e. The other end of the inductance element L2 is connected<br>
to the feed terminal 6 via the via-hole conductor 19h, the<br>
connection conductor pattern 15b, and the via-hole conductors<br>
19m and 19b. The other ends of the inductance elements L1 and <br>
L2 are connected via the connection conductor pattern 15b.<br><br><br>
In the antenna 1J having the above configuration, the LC<br>
series resonant circuits, which include the inductance<br>
elements L1 and L2 magnetically coupled to each other,<br>
resonate to cause the inductance elements L1 and L2 to<br>
function as a radiation element. In addition, the coupling<br>
between the inductance elements L1 and L2 via the capacitance<br>
element C2 and the provision of the branch 16c' (tap) form a<br>
matching circuit matching the impedance (usually 50Ω) of a<br>
device connected between the feed terminals 5 and 6 with the<br>
space impedance (377Ω) .<br>
As a result of a simulation performed by the inventor<br>
based on the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 28, the antenna<br>
1J exhibited reflection characteristics shown in Fig. 30.<br>
(Eleventh Embodiment, Refer to Figs. 31 and 32)<br>
An antenna 1K according to an eleventh embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a configuration in which a capacitance<br>
element C1 is added to the antenna 1J according to the tenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, as shown as an equivalent<br>
circuit in Fig. 31. The same operations and advantages as<br>
those in the tenth embodiment of the present invention are<br>
offered in the eleventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
By providing a mid tap, the space impedance and the impedance<br>
of a device connected between the feed terminals 5 and 6 can<br>
be matched without reducing the electromagnetic field energy.<br>
By adding the capacitance element C1 to the antenna 1J<br><br><br>
according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the impedance matching between the feed terminals 5 and 6 is<br>
facilitated.<br>
Since the antenna 1K having the above circuit<br>
configuration basically has a layered structure similar to the<br>
ones shown in Figs. 8 and 29, a detailed description of the<br>
layered structure of the antenna 1K is omitted herein. As a<br>
result of a simulation performed by the inventor based on the<br>
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 31, the antenna 1K exhibited<br>
reflection characteristics shown in Fig. 32.<br>
When the mid tap is provided as in the tenth and eleventh<br>
embodiments of the present invention to facilitate the<br>
impedance matching between the feed terminals 5 and 6, the<br>
return is increased, and the bandwidth is broadened in<br>
accordance with the increased return. In other words, a<br>
variation in the degree of the impedance matching varies the<br>
bandwidth. Accordingly, in setting a constant for each<br>
inductance element, it is necessary to consider the degree of<br>
impedance matching in order to achieve a desired bandwidth.<br>
(Other Embodiments)<br>
The antenna according to the present invention is not<br>
limited to the embodiments described above, and various<br>
changes and modifications may be made to the present invention<br>
within the scope thereof.<br>
For example, although the LC resonant circuits according<br><br>
to the above embodiments are configured as the lumped constant<br>
circuits, the LC resonant circuits may be configured as<br>
distributed constant circuits. The layered product including<br>
the LC resonant circuits may be made of an insulating material,<br>
instead of the dielectric material. The layered product can<br>
be made of, for example, ceramic or resin.<br>
