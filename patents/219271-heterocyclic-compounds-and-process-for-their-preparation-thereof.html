Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel antidiabetic compounds, their tautomeric forms, their derivatives, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. This invention particularly relates to novel azolidinedione derivatives of the general formula (I), their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel, azolidinedione derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereo isomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, novel intermediates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The azolidinedione derivatives of the general formula (I) defined above of the present invention are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions in which insulin resistance is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Examples of these diseases and conditions are type II diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis. The azolidinedione derivatives of the formula (I) are useful for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis. The azolidinedione derivatives of the formula (I) can also be used to treat diabetic complications and can be used for treatment and/or prophylaxis of other diseases and conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), certain renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, end-stage renal diseases and microalbuminuria as well<br><br>
as certain eating disorders, as aldose reductase inhibitors and for improving cognitive functions in dementia<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin Invest., (1985) 75:809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987)317:350-357; J. Clin. Endocrinal. Metab. (1988) 66: 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest. (1975) 68: 957 - 969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/2 1608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, and atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X. In addition, polycystic ovarian syndrome (Patent Application No. WO 95/07697), psoriasis (Patent Application No. W095/35 108), dementia (Behavioral Brain Research (1996) 75: I - 11) etc. may also have insulin resistance as a central pathogenic feature.<br>
A number of molecular defects have been associated with insulin resistance. These include reduced expression of insulin receptors on the plasma membrane of insulin responsive cells and alterations in the signal transduction pathways that become activated after insulin binds to its receptor including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.<br>
Since defective insulin action is thought to be more important than failure of insulin secretion in the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and other related complications, this raises doubts about the intrinsic suitability of antidiabetic treatment that is based entirely upon stimulation of insulin release. Recently, Takeda has developed a new class of compounds which are the derivatives of 5-(4-aIkoxybenzyl)-2,4-thiazolidinediones of the formula (II) (Ref Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1982, 30, 3580-3600).

The compoimd of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including man, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.10 to about 200 mg/kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0.10 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compound will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can be combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluents to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavorants, sweeteners, excipients and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds<br><br>
can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts or alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be, administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, cutaneously, or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred in humans.<br>

Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob<br><br>
(See Diabetes, (1982) 31(1): 1-6) in mice and fa/fa and zucker rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994). 46: 1-57). The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85: 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, a mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models. Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
The compounds of the present invention showed blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities through improved insulin resistance. This was demonstrated by the following in vivo experiments.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, procured from the Jackson Laboratory, USA, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having more than 300 mg/dl blood sugar were used for testing. The number of animals in each group was 4.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 .mu.l) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy's Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively. On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds/vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br><br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 30 mg/kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 mL/kg). Troglitazone (100 mg/kg, daily dose) was used as a standard drug   which   showed   28%   reduction   in   random   blood   sugar   level   on   6th   day.<br>
