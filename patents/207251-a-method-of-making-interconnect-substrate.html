				<td>A substrate is provided with vias communicating with surface contacts or bumps. Joining material paste is forced through holes in a screen onto an area array of the contacts on the substrate then the screen is biased against the substrate as the paste is heated and cooled to transfer the joining material onto the contacts. Alternately, joining material paste is forced into the screen and then a substrate is placed onto the screen with an area array of bump contacts of the substrate in contact with the solder paste, and then the paste is heated and cooled to transfer the material onto the bumps. The joining material may be a solder paste, conductive adhesive paste, or transient liquid bond paste. The substrate may be a semiconductor chip substrate, flexible or rigid organic substrate, or a metal substrate coated to form a dielectric surface. Also, the substrate may be a computer chip, chip carrier substrate or a circuit board substrate.

The following background along with the other parts of this application enables those skilled in the art in utilizing the inventions of this application without undo experimentation and is not an admission regarding priority or claim that a search has been performed*<br>
BACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION<br>
Solder bump connections have been used for mounting IC's (integrated computer chips) using the C4 (controlled collapse chip connection) technology since first suggested in U.S. patents 3,401,126 and 3,429,040 by Miller. In Packaging Electronic Systems by Dally (McGraw-Hill 1990 p. 113) "Chip bond pads are deployed in an area array over the surface of the chip, .... These bonding pads are 5 mil in<br><br>
diameter on 10 mil centers.  Matching bonding pads are produced on a ceramic substrate so that the pads on the chip and the ceramic coincide• Spheres of solder 5 mil in diameter are placed on the ceramic substrate pads ... and the chip is positioned and aligned relative to the substrate.  The assembly is heated until the solder spheres begin to soften and a controlled collapse of the sphere takes place as the solder simultaneously wets both pads*  A myriad of solder structures have been proposed for mounting IC chips as well as for interconnection to other levels of circuitry and electronic packaging."<br>
Reflow transfer of solder from decals has been developed for.depositing eutectic solder, for attaching flip chips to metal pads'on organic substrates. Stainless steel decals are coated with a thin layer of photoresist which is photo-developed to provide windows in the same pattern as C4 connectors on a flip chip. A thick layer of eutectic Pb/Sn solder is electroplated onto the decals at the windows. The decal is positioned on an organic carrier aligned with connection pads and heated to reflow transfer the solder from the decal onto the pads on the carrier. Then a flip chip is placed on the carrier with C4 pads on the solder and reflow heated to connect the chip to the pads.<br>
Use of epoxy encapsulants to enhance fatigue life of flip-chip connection is suggested in U.S. patents 4,999,699; 5,089,440, and 5,194,930 all to Christie. U,S, patten 4,604,644 to Beckham suggests materials and structures for encapsulating C4 connections,  U.S. patent 4,701,482 to Itoh and patent application (SN 08/493,126 Filed 3/14/90) of Christie et al. disclose epoxies and provide guidance in selecting epoxies for electronic applications.<br>
"Ball grid arrays: the hot new package" by Terry Costlow and "Solder balls make connections" by Glenda<br><br>
Derman both in Electronic Engineering Times March 15, 1993, suggest using solder balls to connect ceramic or flexible chip carriers to circuit-boards. Ball grid array modules include components with plastic (organic), ceramic, and tape carrier substrates known as PBGA, CBGA, and TBGA molues respectively.<br>
Fabrication of multi-layer ceramic chip carriers is suggested in U.S. patents 3/518,756; 3,988,405; and 4,202,007 as well as "A Fabrication Technique For Multi-Layer Ceramic Modules" by H-D. Kaiser et al.f Solid State Technology, May 1972, pp. 35-40  and "The Third Dimension in Thick-Films Multilayer Technology" by W. L. Clough, Microelectronics, Vol. 13, No, 9 (1970), pp. 23-30. Common ceramic materials for electronic packaging substrates include alumina, beryllia, and aluminum nitride. "Pinless Module Connector" by Stephans in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 20, No. 10, March 1978, suggests a ceramic ball grid array module with copper balls. U.S. 5,118,027 to Braun suggests placing solder balls in an alignment boat, vacuum holding the balls while eutectic solder is deposited on the balls, aligning the boat with conductive pads on a substrate and reflowing in an oven and then removing the boat. EP 0,263,222 Al to Bitaillou suggest attaching solder balls to vias in a ceramic substrate to form a ball grid array module,<br>
U.S. patent 4,914,814 to Behun, suggests casting columns onto pads to form ceramic column grid array modules, a graphite plate is drilled with through-holes corresponding to metal pads on the bottom of a chip carrier substrate, then preforms of 3/97 Sn/Pb solder are placed in the holes - Then the plate and carrier substrate are heated to melt the preforms to connect liquid solder to the pads, then the plate and carrier substrate are cooled and the plate is moved away from the carrier leaving the columns cast to the pads.<br><br>
U.S, patent 4,752,027 to Gschwend suggests methods ox bumping printed circuit boards for attaching modules, including screening solder paste, reflowing the paste to form bumps, and using rollers to flatten the solder bumps. U.S. patent 4,558,812 to Bailey suggests using a vacuum plate to simultaniously deposit an array of solder balls on a substrate.<br>
Fabrication of multi-layer rigid organic circuit-boards is suggested in U.S. patents 3,554,877; 3,791,858; and 3/554,877. Thin film Techniques are suggested in U.S. patent 3,791,858.<br>
Flexible film chip carriers (known in the art as Area Tape Automated Bonding (ATAB) modules or TBGA modules) are suggested in U.S. patents 4,681,654 and 5,159,535 and in application Ser. No 07/009,981. In ATAB ^flexible circuit-board chip carrier is mounted on a circuit-board using solder ball connect. U.S. patents 5,057,969 to Ameen, and 5,133,495, 5,203,075, and 5,261,155 to Angulas suggests using solder balls to connect TBGA modules to circuit boards.<br>
U.S. patent 5,261,593 to Casson suggests providing solder paste on a plurality of contact pads on a flexible printed circuit substrate (polyimide); placing flip-chips on the substrate with solder bumps of the flip-chip in registration with the pads; and heating to ref low the paste to electrically connect the bumps to the pads. According to Casson bumped flip-chips are un-packaged meaning they have no plastic shells nor metallic leads- Casson describes bumping chips (C4) by sputtering titanium/tungsten to promote adhesion to a passivation layer; sputtering copper; applying and developing a photoresist; electroplating copper and then 3/97 to 10/90 Sn/Pb or 63/35/2 Pb/Sn/Ag solder; removing the photoresist; and wet etching the exposed copper and titanium/tungsten to form 9 mil diameter bumps about 4.5 mil high (60 mils3) . He also suggests<br><br>
producing flexible Novaclad® (polyimide film with sputtered copper by E. I Du Pont de Nuemers) circuit substrates; optical alignment of stencils with substrates; screening 63/37 Sn/Pb solder paste through a 4 mil stencil with 14 mil openings with a round squeegee of 90 durometer at 1.5 inches/second and 22 psi pressure to provide 6E-7 in3 deposits on pads of flexible substrates; self alignment during reflow heating using vapor phase or in IR or convection ovens; and epoxy chip encapsulation*<br>
U.S. patent 3,781,596 suggests a single layer interconnection structure of metallic conductors on a polyimide film (e«g. KAPTON™ by E. I. DuPont de Numers). U.S. patent 3/868,724 suggests metallic conductors sandwiched between polyimide film, which projects through the film. U.S. patent 5,112,462 to Swisher suggests producing adhesivless flexible substrates of polyimide film and copper sputtered and then electroplated onto the film.<br>
Floropolymer based films have been proposed for flexible circuit-boards such as PTFE filled with ceramic, or glass particles or fibers such as woven fiberglass, and Kevlar® (by Chemfab Corporation).  Gore Company makes woven PTFE fabrics for impregnating with resins to form flexible dielectric substrates• Also molded thermoplastics have been used for flexible one sided and double sided circuit-boards .<br>
Connecting components directly to one side of a single-layer flexible circuit-board is described by McBride in "Multi-function Plug for IC Package", IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol, 21, Feb 1979, pp. 3594-3595-  I/O terminals on the bottom of a chip are soldered to pads on top of a thin polyimide flexible decal. Also, a depression in a heat sink cover is bonded onto the top of the chip. Connecting lower power chips to a bottom side of a multilayer flexible circuit-board and high power chips to the top side of the flexible circuit-board in order to connect<br><br>
the high power chips tc the module cap is suggested by McBride, "Multilayer Flexible Film Module", IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol 26, May 1984, p 6637,  In that article I/O pins connect the flexible film to a metalized ceramic substrate, and smaller pins interconnect the layers of the film- Schrottke, "Removal of Heat from Direct Chip Attach Circuitry" Vol 32, Sept 1989, pp. 346-348 describes a flexible circuit-board with two rows of Direct Chip Attach (DCA) chips attached by controlled collapse chip connections (C4).  The flexible circuit-board is folded around a stiff heat spreader of copper-INVAR-copper (INVAR is a trademark of Creusot-Loire for nickel-iron alloys) the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of INVAR can be controlled by varying the ratio of nickel and iron and by varying the thickness of plated metal coatings such as copper.<br>
U.S. patent 4,967,950 to Legg suggests tinning contact pads with eutectic solder metal and positioning a flip-chip with C4 bumps on the solder on the pads.<br>
U.S. patent 5,147,084 to Behun, suggests using a HMP (high melting point) solder ball in association with a LMP (low melting point) solder.  "A part 10 is to be joined to a board 11.  Part 10 has internal metallurgy 14 which terminates at the surface at a bonding pads 12.  A . . . LMP solder 16 is applied to a bonding pad 12.  A ... HMP solder ball 18 is placed in contact with LMP solder 16 and the assembly is heated to reflow the LMP solder which then wets to the non-molten HMP solder ball. ... Board 11 is also illustrated with internal metallurgy 15, terminating on the surface bonding pad 17. •.. the assembled part 10 ... is brought into contact with part 11 having pad 17 and LMP solder 13, and the two are heated to a temperature sufficient to reflow the LMP solder but not sufficient to reflow the LMP solder but not sufficient to melt the HMP solder ball.  The LMP solder 13 which is attached to the<br><br>
bonding pad 17, on board 11, will wet the HMP ball and connection will be achieved*"<br>
Solders have a melting temperature range extending from a solidus temperature to a liquidious temperature in which they have a pasty consistency that varies with temperature from solid to liquid respectively over the range* Molten refers to heating sufficiently to wet to another material or cure to another material in the case o: epoxies and thermoplastics containing solvents.<br>
U.S. patent 4,825,034 to Auvert suggests a micro-beam laser machine for acting on thin layers of materials especially integrated circuits. Laser cutting and welding machines for making stencils are available from Meisseirchipaitt Bolkow Blohm, Northern Plant, 7312 Kirchheim/Teck Nobern.<br>
. . "Ball Grid Array Module Solder Stencil Template" by Isaacs et al. in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin vol. 37, No. 06B, June 1994, p. 225/ suggests a template or spacer to supporting a stencil to screen solder paste onto distal ends of ball grid array balls and column grid array columns for rework*<br>
"Solder Preform Technique for Fine Pitch Surface Mount Technology components" by Nilsen et al. in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 02, February 1993, p. 397, suggests solder carriers the size of an SMT component for depositing solder on substrates. The solder is screened into cavities (blind holes) in the carrier, then the carrier is placed on a PC card.<br>
In one embodiment the carrier consists of three parts including a screen plate with through holes aligned with holes in a carrier plate and a solid back plate- The screen plate is removed, the carrier plate is placed on the card, the back plate is removed, the component is placed on the carrier plate, and the solder paste is reflowed. In a second embodiment using the same three parts, the back<br><br>
plate is removed, the carrier plate is placed on the card, the solder is reflowed, the screening plate is removed, a component is placed on the carrier plate and the solder is reflowed again. In a third embodiment using the same three parts, the solder is reflowed then the back plate is removed, the carrier plate is placed on the card, the solder is reflowed again, the screen plate is removed, a component is placed on the carrier plate and the solder is reflowed for the third time.<br>
In a final embodiment the carrier is one plate with cavities, which is placed cavity down on the PC card and the solder paste is reflowed to deposite the solder onto the card, then the plate is mechaniclly removed or disolved by solvent* Then the component is placed on the site and the solder is reflowed,<br>
U..S. patent 5,196,726 to Nishiguchi suggests packaging substrates with recesses containing plated electrode terminals (100 ixm dia) covered by a vacuum deposited solder with a lower melting temperature than the bumps (e.g. Au/20%Sn or Pb/40%Sn) • Bumps of an IC chip (80 Jim dia and 30 lira  high) fit the recesses.<br>
U.S. patent 5,024,372 to Altman suggests forming solder bumps by applying at least a 10 mil preferably 15 mil thick layer of photo definable solder resist to a ceramic, polyimide, or circuit-board substrate; selectively removing resist to form wells over metal pads in a grid array on the substrate; using a squeegee to apply solder paste into the wells; reflowing the paste; and removing the resist. It also suggests connecting a solder bumped member to a substrate by forming the wells filled with a solder paste (having a melting temperature lower than the solder bumps) over pads on the substrate in a pattern corresponding to the solder bumps; positioning the member over the substrate so that the bumps settle into the solder paste; and reflow heating to melt the solder paste but not<br><br>
the solder bumps to wet the metal pads and blend with the solder bumps,<br>
U.S. patent 5,388,327 to Trabucco discloses injecting liquid solder into holes formed through a disolvable film carrier onto contact pads of a ball grid array module to form solder balls. The film may be water, acitone, or soluable in a flux solvent such as CFCs or turpenes.<br>
JP 4-263433 A to Watanabe suggests recessions in a surface filled with a metallic paste by a sliding squeegee and then heating to 230°C using a heating head to melt the paste and form metallic balls. Then electrode pads of an IC chip are pressure-fixed to the balls in the recessions to form electric-connection contacts•<br>
U-S* patent 4,311,267 to Lim suggests connecting leads (tins) to SIP or DIP packages by: forming interconnected conductive pads on a alumina ceramic substrate (0.5 by 1.0 inches), by thick film techniques and including lead pads (70 by 80 mils) and component pads (70 mils square); clipping leads (10 by 20 mil) to the substrate edge at lead pads; and screening solder paste through a stencil onto the leads, lead pads, and component pads. The citation suggests chemically milling brass stencils from both sides by coating with photoresist; applying artwork negatives to both sides; exposing to light through the artwork; developing and washing away the unexposed resist; and etching from both sides. Then a 1 mil layer of nickel is plated onto the stencil plate to improve abrasion resistance by increasing surface hardness. The citation suggests several sources of screen printing machines for printing solder paste and describes their operation.<br>
U.S. patents 5,211,764 and 5,346,118 to Degani suggests printing Sn/Pb/Bi 43/43/14 solder through a 21 mil (up to 30 mil) thick stencil with rectangular openings which taper at an angle 5-10° (less than 45°) from vertical from a narrow top opening (60 mil) to a wider bottom<br><br>
opening (64 mil) onto a 10 by 10 grid array of about 33 mil pads on 100 mil centers (as low as 30 mil pads on 60 mil centers) to produce bumps (up to 30 mil high have been demonstrated) on an IC circuit on a wafer. The bottom opening area is up to 5 times larger than the pad area and double printing (i.e. print and reflow, then print and reflow again) can be used to increase paste volume. The paste includes a special flux and additives to provide low stickiness and metal loading is increased to as high as 80% by using two different sized powers. Using paste with a high ratio of metal volume minimize slump so that (hole bottom diameter) / (stencil thickness) can be as low as l,5r but preferably 2.5,. and (hole bottom diameter) / (pad spacing) can be as low as 0.75.<br>
U*S. patent 4,722/470 to Johary suggests forming an array of two rows of rectangular, non-reentrant cavities in a solid block or plate of titanium (a material non-wetted by solder), in a pattern matching a pattern of J-leads on a PLCC; loading the cavities with solder paste by wiping solder paste on the plate surface with blade or squeegee to force the paste into the cavities; coating all but the end portion of the J-lead with solder resist; aligning the J-leads in registration with the cavities with an exposed portion of each J-lead in contact with the paste; and reflowing the paste to form a mass of molten solder on the end portion of each J-lead- Johary suggests "Lead to lead spacing of 0.050 inch are common, and closer spacing such as 0-025 inch are anticipated"; also "Surface mount techniques are used to secure a wide variety of components or devices" and "the invention is applicable as well to other lead configuration such as outwardly extending gull-wing leads, downwardly extending I leads and other leads or metallizations of various types."<br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONS<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a simpler, less critical/ more accurate, and less expensive method for bumping flip-chips and for bumping carrier modules.<br>
It is an object of this invention to form small bumps on flip-chips by providing high melting temperature (HMT) solder onto flat metal pads of wafers or flip-chips for subsequent attachment of the flip-chips to ceramic substrates, and to provide the solder economically, reliably and at a high production rate.<br>
It is another object to provide small quantities of low joining temperature (LJT) solder onto small bumps of HMT solder (C4 bumps) on flip-chips, for subsequent attachment to organic carrier substrates for more economical, reliable, and higher production of attachment than by the common process of screening solder on the attachment substrate especially for rework•<br>
It is another object to form small, LJT bumps on flip-chips by providing LJT solder directly on the flat bottom side pads of wafers or flip-chips for subsequent attachment to flexible organic substrates, or organic coated substrates of a base with about the same CTE as the chip, or for subsequent attachment to other substrates for applications with moderate temperature variations.<br>

. It is another object to produce circuit-boards with reworked components•<br>
It is another object to produce a preform holder for providing solder*<br>
It is another object to produce tooling for biasing a stencil against a substrate•<br>
It is another object to produce a bottom plate under the circuit-board for the screening process and methods for using the new bottom plate.<br>

Finally it is an object of this invention to produce information handling systems using the improved method of manufacture.<br><br>
In -this application the words "connector" and "interconnector" refer to either a flat pad or bump of conductive material on a surface of a component. The word "bump" refers to connectors that extend higher from the underlying substrate then the typical wiring in the wiring layer on the component or higher than the wiring layers typically found on the respective type of component such as flip-chips, ball grid array (BGA) modules, quad flat packs, flexible and rigid organic substrates, ceramic substrates, etc. Bumps include balls which have their greatest diameter away from the surface• Bumps also include solder columns with round cross sections that extend about perpendicularly from a.component surface to a height greater than the diameter of the bump. The word vterminaV- is used generically to include pads, bumps, and leads such as gull-wing-leads J-leads, and I-leads.<br>
The term "grid array" is used in describing the arrangement of C4 bumps on the bottoms of flip-chips and the -arrangement of balls on the bottom of ball grid array (BGA) modules and the arrangement of columns on the bottom of a column grid array (CGA) module, in which the connectors are typically positioned in a square matrix with rows perpendicular to column with regular equal spacing between the connections in the rows and column (like the corners of a checkers board)• Although convenient for layout, there is no technical requirement that the pattern of connections for such components be so regular, and the invention contemplates connectors that are not included at some grid locations and even grids of random spacing. Thus, in this application the term array refers to any arbitrary pattern of connection terminals; peripheral array refers to two or more rows of two or more terminals that define a boundary (such as a rectangle defined by leads of a duel in line package); area array and grid array refer to regular or irregular patterns that include both a peripheral array<br><br>
of terminals and other internal terminals spaced significantly inwardly away from the boundary of peripheral terminals (e.g. at least the minimum spacing between boundary connections).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of the invention holes through a transfer substrate are aligned with connectors of a component then joining material paste is screened into the through-holes directly onto the connectors then the transfer substrate and component are heated while biased together and cooled to transfer the joining material onto the connectorsf then the transfer substrate is mechanically removed* This allows bumps of joining material to be formed on flat connection pads or allows LJT joining material to be deposited on HMT bumps or other terminals of a component. The joining material paste may be a LJT solder paste or HMT solder paste or transient liquid phase (TLP) paste or a conductive adhesive paste. The component may be a leaded component such as a quad flat pack; or a bumped component such as a flip-chip or BGA or CGA module or an interconnect structure such as a circuit board.<br>
In a second embodiment joining material is deposited into blind holes (cavities) in a transfer member then a component is aligned with bumps in contact with the joining material and the component and transfer member are heated and then cooled together to transfer the joining material onto the bumps,, then the component is mechanically removed from the transfer member.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a specific embodiment of the process of the invention for producing flip chips. In step 100 of Fig. 1, a silicon wafer attachment substrate with an attachment surface is formed. For example, a seed of silicon is inserted in a crucible of molten silicon and a single about cylindrical crystal of silicon is pulled by a motor as the crucible spins about the axis of the cylinder, in relation<br><br>
to the cylinder. The crystal is sawed by a band or disk saw, or by laser into thin wafers which are polished in a mechanical polisher to form the substrates and inspected.<br>
In step 102 electronic devices are formed on the surface of the substrate. A photographic process similar to that described below is used to control the addition of dopant in a dry deposition process such as vacuum evaporation, or more preferably by sputtering to form electronic devices such as transistors, diodes, triodes, etc. on the surface of the wafer. The devices are organized into memory devices, registers, and logic gates.<br>
In step 104, one of more wiring layers including wiring pads on the attachment surface and wires connecting the pads to the electronic devices are formed. The wiring layers commonly include a layer of polysilicon wires and one or more layers of metal wires which are commonly of aluminum. The wiring layers are separated.by a dielectric which is commonly silicon dioxide. The top wiring layer includes the wiring pads that form an array for electrically connecting the wiring layer to a chip carrier. The wiring layers are produced photographically by dry depositing photoresist, exposing to electromagnetic rays by laser or through a artwork mask, rinsing or dry or wet etching to selectively remove the photoresist, and dry depositing metals. The metals can be selectively deposited over the photoresist to form a wiring layer when the photoresist is stripped- Alternatively, a patterned photoresist can be formed over the metals and then the exposed metal is wet or dry etched to selectively remove the metal and form the wiring layers. Then if desired the photoresist may be stripped off the wafer. The wiring layers include wiring pads electrically connected by wiring conductors of the wiring layers and conductive vias between layers, to the electronic devices-<br><br>
In step 106 a passivation layer commonly of silicon dioxide, glass, and/or polyimide is dry deposited over the wiring layers and wiring pads, and in step 108 windows are formed through the passivation layer at the wiring pads. Step 108 may be performed after step 106 by using a photo resist for the passivation layer or by depositing the layer over a photoresist which is then removed, or a photoresist may be deposited over the passivation, developed, and the exposed passivation etched away which may be followed by removing the resist or any of the know process for forming passivation layers of chips may be used*<br>
Wiring pads for flip-chips usually include a peripheral array of pads that define a rectangular boundary and interior pads within the boundary which are spaced significantly Inward toward the center of the rectangle from the boundary. Preferably, the pads are positioned at the intersection of two groups each of two or more equally spaced apart lines, with the lines in each group perpendicular to the lines in the other group, to form a square grid array (like common graph paper)* Preferably, the pads define at least three concentric rectangles preferably about square rectangles. Wire bond pads of wire bond chips form only a peripheral array and the bond pads and windows are usually much larger In area than are the wiring pads for area array flip-chip connection.<br>
In step 110 for flip-chips, flat connector pads are formed on the passivation layer. A layer of chromium, titanium, or tungsten is deposited on the passivation to promote adhesion of the connectors. Then conductive connectors are built on the passivation surface. Copper may be deposited for conduction because it is highly conductive, inexpensive, and methods for depositing copper are simple, inexpensive, and well known. However, when copper is used and solder will be reflowed in contact with the pads, a layer of aluminum may be deposited to protect<br><br>
the copper from dissolving in the solder. A photoresist pattern is developed on the surface and then the layer is selectively etched to provide the connector pads extending out on the passivation layer from the windows.<br>
In step 112 which is optional, HMT bumps may be provided on the pad connectors to form bump connectors. The HMT material may be a thick layer of dry deposited aluminum, or preferably the layer of copper has been made thick by electroplating, or more preferably an HMT solder is provided, HMT solder may be applied by dry deposition over photo-patterned resist which is then stripped. Alternately, a thin flash layer may be dry deposited, a photoresist layer patterned, and then additional solder electroplated in the pattern followed by stripping and etching to remove the exposed flash. Then the deposited solder may be reflowed to form hemispherical bumps or balls of solder. More preferably any HMT solder is transferred from a transfer substrate by reflowing as described below. Such HMT solder may be provided in the transfer substrate as paste or as liquid solder. Also, the HMT material may be placed on the connectors as preforms, which are then reflow attached by melting the HMT solder or by melting a LJT joining material between the connector pad and preform. The HMT preforms preferably communicate with flux during reflow to remove any oxide coating on the preform. Flux can be sprayed onto the preforms and connector pads after placement, or flux such as formic acid, can be mixed in a gas and delivered from a nozzle during reflow, but preferably the preforms are coated with flux by dipping, spraying, or bubbling prior to placement and most preferably the attachment surface and connector pads are dipped, sprayed or bubble coated with sticky flux prior to placing the preforms to hold the preforms in place. If LJT paste is used to reflow connect an HMT preform to the connector pads, the paste may contain the flux-<br><br>
Melting temperatures of common HMT solders range from 230°C to 320°C, Preferably, the HMT solder is a high Pb solder alloy such as 3% to 15% Sn, or more preferably less than about 10% Sn and most preferably about 6/94% Sn/Pb, Pb solder with 3% to 10% Sn has a softening temperature (solidus) around 300°C. Other HMT solders are available for example the solidus temperature for 90/5/5 Pb/In/Ag is 290°C, for 95/5 Pb/In its 315°C, and for 95/5 Sn/Sb its 236°C. The HMT solder should be reflowable at a temperature that will not damage the substrate, electronic devices, wiring, or passivation layer.<br>
The blimps preferably have sufficient solder to extend 10% to 300% of the diameter of the connector pads out from the attachment surface* More preferably the bumps extend 40% to 200% of the pad diameter, and most preferably 80% to 160% of the pad diameter. The larger the connector pads and the further the bumps extend in relation to the maximum sized pads, the lower the thermal fatigue, but the size of pads that can be reliably formed and reflowed without solder bridging is limited by the center to center spacing between the connection pads and the spacing between pad edges required to reliably prevent solder bridging, which also depends on the positional accuracy of the pad edges. The size of reflowed balls is limited by the pad spacing and the positional accuracy to prevent bridging between balls during reflow.<br>
After reflow the HMT material may be flattened using a pneumatic flattener to press an anvil against the bumps of HMT joining material on the connectors of the attachment surface. Alternately rolls may be used to flatten the bumps. Flattening is especially advantageous when the component is to be placed on hemispherical ended bumps on another substrate since confronting hemispherical bumps tend to interact during placement and subsequent vibrations to bias the component out of position.<br><br>
In step 114 a transfer substrate with a transfer surface is produced, and in step 116 a plurality of holes are formed in the transfer surface in a mirror image pattern to the pattern of the connectors on the attachment substrate. The walls of the holes (and preferably also the transfer surface) must not significantly adhere to a joining material so that the joining material can be successfully transferred from the holes to the connectors on the attachment surface. The holes may be produced by a mechanical or laser drill (pulsed YAG laser) or chemically by photolithographic equipment similar to those described above. Blind holes (cavities) produced by a mechanical drill typically have round openings, cylindrical side walls, and a conical bottom wall, but flat bottomed cavities can be produced by machining or special drills, and special drills are also available to produce other shapes such as square holes. Blind holes may also be formed by providing a transfer substrate with through-holes and providing a backing plate. Preferably, the backing plate is biased against the transfer substrate (for example by adhesive lamination) to prevent transportation of joining material between the holes. Through-holes with tapered walls can be produced by chemical etching through a mask, by special drills or other machining or by laser. Preferably, the holes are about perpendicular to the transfer surface*<br>
The transfer substrate may be produced from a solid plate or other shape of a material to which the joining material inherently does not significantly adhere or the walls of the holes and preferably also the transfer surface may be coated with a material to which the joining material does not significantly adhere. Also the surfaces (of the holes and attachment surface) may be treated to reduce adhesion by applying a lubricant or release material such as those used in casting and molding of metals, ceramics,<br><br>
and organics or more preferably by micro-etching. For joining materials of HMT solder the base material of the transfer substrate may be titanium, molybdenum, or nickel (which has been oxidized at elevated temperatures), stainless steel, or more preferably high chromium stainless steel or a ceramic such as SiC or A1N to which molten solder does not wet to the joining material. Alternately a coated substrate may be used with a base of iron, INVAR, Cu-INVAR-Cu or for transfer to a silicon attachment substrate, more preferably a silicon transfer substrate is used. These materials may be coated by another metal or ceramic to which solder does not significantly wet and which can be reliably deposited on the base material preferably by dry deposition preferably sputtering. Such materials include chromium, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten, nickel (which has been subsequently oxidized) and combinations thereof and preferably ceramics such as titanium nitride. For one or the preferred embodiments for through-holes in the transfer substrate, the substrate is preferably a magnetic material (preferably a magnetic stainless steel or a coated magnetic steel) for biasing the transfer substrate against the attachment surface by magnetism during screening and/or during reflow heating and possibly also during cooling. For LJT materials such as conductive adhesives or eutectlc Sn/Pb solder, or TLP systems, organic substrates such as epoxy filled with woven fiberglass or polyimide substrates may be used. Also for LJT materials, organic coatings such as organic solder resist may be used over a metal, or organic base for such LJT materials- Preferrably the organic material is not wettable by liquid solder to serve as a dewetting agent. One example material is PRIBIMER®(Ciba-Geigy Corp).<br>
For some applications two transfer substrates may be desired. A first substrate has holes for an HMT joining material to form bump connectors as in step 112 above for<br><br>
maintaining separation when the attachment surface is connected to another substrate* A second transfer substrate has holes for a LJT material for connecting between the bumped connectors and interconnectors on the surface of the other substrate. In this case the volume of the LJT material after reflow should be from 10% to 70% of the volume of the HMT material after reflow.<br>
Assuming the same pad and ball diameters for attaching a BGA module to a circuit-board pad, if the volume of ref lowed eutectic solder connecting a HMT ball to a pad falls below 10% of the volume of the ball then stresses begin to increase dramatically, but if the ref lowed volume of the LJT solder exceeds 25% of the volume of the ball then the eutectic will flow onto the joint between the carrier substrate and the ball, and if the volume of the eutectic exceeds 50% of the volume of the ball then the ball will start to-bulge.  Some conductive joining materials such as liquid solder have the same volume after joining as during application, but other joining materials such as conductive adhesives and solder pastes have substantially smaller cured volumes. For example the volume of reflowed solder paste is typically only 40% to 60% of their application volumes. Thus for example to provide a second solder with 50% of the volume of a first solder bump formed by injecting HMT liquid solder in the holes of the first substrate and then using a LJT solder paste for the second solder which shrinks to 40% of its screened volume, the holes in the second plate would preferably have 125% of the volume of the holes in the first plate.<br>
For photo-lithographically forming small holes in the transfer substrate, the transfer surface is covered with a coating of photoresist which is selectively exposed to electromagnetic radiation by positioning a mask between a source of such radiation and the transfer surface or by directed radiation such as from a laser, or by a particle<br><br>
beam. Then the radiated or the un-radiated (depending on the type of photoresist) is removed by a solvent or water rinse or by wet or dry etching. Then holes are etched into the plate at selectively exposed locations* If the holes are through-holes they can be formed by simultaneously etching from both sides of the plate. Although rectangular holes hold more joining material for the same width round holes are usually easier to make, and round holes or at least rounded corners release the joining material more easily.<br>
The walls between holes should be sufficiently thick to reliably form the walls depending on the thickness tolerances, and to prevent damaging the walls during screening and reflow to prevent significant amounts of solder from moving between holes. Currently, we prefer the width at least 0.025 mm for round holes and 0.050 mm for rectangular holes which are more critical. Preferably, holes are as wide as spacing between centers allows to allow the reflowing bumps to reach up to contact the connectors. Thus, holes larger than .2 mm are preferably rectangular and smaller than 0*2 mm are preferably round*<br>
The configuration of the holes is selected to provide the desired amount of joining material at each connection pad. Preferably, the holes are sized to provide bumps with a height between 10% and 200% of the diameter of the connector pads, more preferably the bumps have a height between 40% and 180% of the width of the pads and most preferably 80% to 160% of the width of the pads. If the HMT solder balls are reflow attached directly to the pads then the diameter of solder balls will be slightly larger than the height of the balls. For example solder balls with a height of 150% of pad diameter, the ball diameter would be 167% of pad diameter. For flip-chips holes should be from about J mm to 1 mm wide, and for bumped chip carriers they should be from .5 mm to 3.54 mm wide. Preferably,   the<br><br>
solder bump diameters are smaller than the hole diameters in order to prevent damage to the structure during cooling and minimize binding between the bumps and the sides of the holes when the attachment surface is moved away from the transfer surface. The depth of the holes should be from 0,1 to 10 times of their width, more preferably 0*3 to 3 times their width, most preferably 0.5 to 0-9 times their width-For blind holes the depth of the cavity is preferably less than the height of the bumps in order for the bump to extend significantly up from the hole.<br>
For example, flip-chip pads are typically 0.13 mm dia on 0,23 mm centers and preferably the diameters of the balls are slightly larger than the pad diameter e.g. 0.18 mm, requiring about 0.00305 mm3 of solder. For a solder paste that shrinks 50% in volume during reflow, 0.0061 mm3 are required. Therefore, for cylindrical holes with .2 mm dia, the holes need to be about .19 ram deep, and for etched cavities with curved bottom walls the holes would need to be slightly deeper at the center. More preferably the cavities are -18 mm square holes .18 mm deep.<br>
Steps 114 - 116, related to preparing the transfer substrate, may be performed before after or simultaneously with steps 100 - 112 which prepare the attachment substrate -<br>
In step 118 joining material is provided in the holes. The material may be HMT material to form joining bumps on the connection pads or a LJT material to form such joining bumps or for covering previously made bumps of HMT materials for joining the bumps to connectors on another substrate- Generally HMT materials have joining temperatures that are too high for use with organic substrates-  LJT materials have sufficiently low joining temperatures for use with the relevant organic materials without significant damage, which typically ranges below 230°C. When a LJT solder is used to prevent disturbing HMT<br><br>
solder during reflow, the,liquids temperature of the LJT solder should be substantially below the solidus temperature of the HMT solder, such as a difference of at least 50°C and more preferably 100°C. For example the solidus temperature of 6/94% Sn/Pb is about 316°C and the liquidus temperature of eutectic 63/37 Sn/Pb solder is 183°C/ of 42/58 Sn/Bi is 138°C, of Sn/Pb/Bi 43/43/14 is about 181°C, and of In/Sn.52/48 is 117°C. The joining material may be placed as liquid solder metal to directly form metal preforms in the holes. Alternately, the material may be a transient liquid phase (TLP) bond system such as a mixture of Sn and Pb, Cu, Ag, or Au particles or Sn covered Pb, Cu, Ag or Au particles or Pb, Cu, Ag or Au covered Sn particles, or other TLP metal systems in a liquid carrier to form a paste or in an epoxy carrier, or in a conductive adhesive carrier with a solvent. Preferably, the joining material is a solder paste of metal particles (alloy particles or mixtures of pure metal particles or a combination thereof) in a carrier such as a liquid (water or alcohol) that forms a molten solder alloy during reflow. Preferably, the paste is a water-clean paste that includes a flux which leaves a residue after reflow that is water soluble or can be removed by flushing with water, or more preferably a no-clean paste which contains a no-clean flux such as adipic or citric acid that leaves only a small quantity of substantially inert residue.<br>
The residue is identifiable as resulting from use of no-clean flux. The material can be placed in the holes by injecting liquid solder metal in the holes for molding preforms in site, or the material can be dispensed from a syringe which can be pre-loaded with solder paste. Preferably, the paste is applied by dumping paste such as solder or TLP paste onto the transfer surface and sliding a organic or metal blade such as a rubber squeegee over the surface to force the paste into the holes.<br><br>
Alternately, both preformed spheres of HMT material and also LJT material may be placed into the holes provided the holes are larger than the preforms* If the holes are deeper than the preforms then the preforms can be placed in the holes and paste stenciled over the preforms, but preferably the paste is stenciled first or both before and after preform placement. If the HMT material contains a constitute which is soluble in the heated LJT material (such as Pb in 95/5 Pb/Sn HMT solder which is soluble in 37/63 Pb/Sn LJT solder) the heating is preferably to a minimum temperature and for a minimum time to connect the HMT preforms to the connectors in one step without melting the preforms and preferably with forced cooling to minimize the dissolution.<br>
In step 120 the attachment and transfer surfaces are moved relatively together with a plurality of the connectors aligned with a corresponding plurality of the holes. Preferably, the transfer substrate is optically aligned with the attachment surface for example by using a machine vision system such as a CCD camera and a computer system with a vision recognition program. Preferably, the substrates are positioned horizontal before are as they are moved together. For cavities the attachment surface is positioned above the transfer surface. For through-holes in the transfer surface, the transfer surface is positioned above the attachment surface.<br>
In the case of transfer plates with through-holes step 120 of moving the transfer and attachment surfaces together can be performed prior to step 118 of providing joining material in the holes. Performing step 118 before 120 in such case, allows the transfer substrate to be used as a stencil in a printing machine to screen joining material into the holes directly onto the connectors. The transfer substrate is preferably biased tightly against the attachment surface during screening and subsequent heating<br><br>
to prevent forming conductive bridges between the connectors. Preferably, the surfaces are held together by providing a transfer substrate of magnetic material and providing permanent magnets positioned in a bottom plate under the attachment surface for attracting the transfer surface down onto the attachment surface. In an alternate preferred embodiment the bottom plate is slightly rounded and the attachment and transfer substrates are stretched slightly bent against the bottom plate to hold them together. In another alternate embodiment the transfer substrate is a bent plate which is held flat on the bottom plate to bias the plates together. These methods can be combined is desired.<br>
In step 122 the joining material and connectors are heated to adhere the joining material to the connectors on the attachment surface and then in step 124 the joining material and connectors are cooled. The heating may be performed using a heating head or directed hot air, and is more preferably performed using an infra red (IR) reflow oven, vapor phase chamber, or a convection reflow oven. Preferably, the wafer is moved from a screen printing machine and placed on a track or conveyor belt and transported through a convection reflow oven.<br>
Preferably, the geometry and the heating and cooling methods provide for the transfer substrate and attachment surface to simultaneously expand and then simultaneously shrink together during heating and cooling so that they stay sufficiently aligned for the accurate transfer of the joining material and do not disturb the joining material during cooling. Preferably, materials with about the same CTE are selected for the transfer and attachment substrates, more preferably the same materials. Also, preferably the thickness of the transfer substrate and attachment substrates are selected in view of the heat capacities of their respective materials and the method of<br><br>
heating so that the substrates heat up and cool down together so the alignment is maintained during heating and then cooling. Preferably, for silicon wafers, the attachment substrate is also a silicon wafer with about the same mass per area and exposed to about the same heating conditions so the connectors and holes in the respective wafers about maintain alignment during heating and cooling. The silicon transfer substrate may be coated to prevent weting by the joining material.<br>
The heating temperature and heating profile are determined by the joining material and the resistance of the joined members to damage due to heat. Conductive adhesive joining materials require relatively low heating temperatures to cure.<br>
In step 126 the transfer and attachment surfaces are moved relatively apart from each other. The transfer and attachment surfaces may be separated before cooling (i.e. performing step 126 before 124) to provide a shape that does, not have indentations of the walls of the holes and the joining material is not broken off the connectors by forces between the joining material and walls of the holes if the transfer substrate and attachment. If a cavity that is shorter than the resulting solder bump is provided, then the end of the bump will have the shape of the bottom of the cavity. Advantageously, if the bottom is flatter than a hemisphere during reflow the bump will ball and reach out to connect after placement, and if about flat the bump will not tend to bias the component out of alignment with an array of confronting hemispherical connection bumps.<br>
For solder joining material, after reflow the solder bumps may be flattened using a pneumatic flattener to press an anvil against the bumps on the connectors of the attachment surface. Flattening is especially advantageous when the component is to be placed on hemispherical ended bumps on another substrate since un-flattened bumps<br><br>
interact during placement and subsequent vibrations to bias the component out of alignment relative to such hemispherical bumps.<br>
In step 128 the wafer is diced into a plurality of integrated computer (IC) chips. This step may be performed anywhere in the process but is preferably done at the end so that the entire wafer can be simultaneously processed in the method of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a method of making the module of the invention with a bumped chip. In step 140 an interconnect chip carrier substrate is formed with a dielectric surface. The substrate may include an organic material such as a thermoset (epoxy), a polyimide, a PTFE, or a thermoplastic. Rigid organic substrates are preferably filled with dielectric particles such as ceramic or glass, or more preferably dielectric fibers which are rigid in an axial direction even more preferably the fibers are woven glass cloth (e.g. G-10 or FR-4) or PTFE fiber cloth. Alternately, the substrate may include a base of ceramic such as beryllia or aluminum nitride and preferably alumina. Also, the substrate may be include a base of metallic material such as INVAR, Cu-INVAR-Cu or Cu which is coated with a dielectric. Organic, ceramic, and metal substrates may be coated with organic dielectrics such as polyimides, thermosets, thermoplastics, preferably a common solder resist is used. Ceramic and metallic substrates may also be coated with dielectric ceramics preferably SiC or AlN for example by sputtering.<br>
In step 142 a wiring layer is formed on the dielectric surface including a plurality of interconnectors which adhere to the joining material when heated. The interconnectors may be one pattern for one chip or preferably multiple for a plurality of chips. The pads are preferably about the same size as the pads on the chip.  The material of the wiring layer may be etched copper foil, or may be<br><br>
dry deposited or chemically and/or electrically deposited copper for a flexible laminated board or rigid organic board The wiring material may be conductive ink screened onto ceramic or metals sputtered through a mask onto ceramic* The wiring layer may consist only of inter-connectors which may be only vias extending through the dielectric layer or may include lands surrounding such vias, but preferably the interconnectors are flat pads or bumps of copper and the wiring layer includes conductors connected to the interconnectors, the conductors may connect between the interconnectors and conductive vias, other interconnectors for the semiconductor component, other interconnectors for other components, or interconductors for connecting from the wiring layer to another interconnect substrate« The interconnectors may be coated with a thin layer of solder by hot air solder leveling (HASL) or an organic such as Benzotriazole which is compatible with soldering to prevent oxidation of the interconnectors* Alternately a bump of HMT solder may be formed on a ceramic or metal substrate or placed on an organic substrate as a preform ball. Also steps 120 - 126 may be performed on the carrier substrate instead of on the wafer so that the flat conductive pads of an unbumped chip may be connected to joining material bumps on the interconnect structure*<br>
A wiring layer may be formed on the two opposite dielectric surfaces of the interconnect substrate with pads for connecting computer chips to both surfaces.<br>
In step 144 a flip-chip is produced- Step 144 includes the steps 100 - 112 described above in reference to Fig, 1-In step 146 attachment bumps of joining material are produced. Step 146 may include steps 112 - 12 8 describe above in reference to Fig. 1. Alternatively, the bumps of joining material may be produced on the interconnectors on the dielectric surface of the interconnect substrate rather<br><br>
than on the connectors on the attachment surface of the attachment substrate on the flip chip as in steps 112 - 12 8 above. Also, high temperature bumps may be formed on one or the connectors and interconnectors, and low temperature joining material deposited on the other one. Steps 144 and 146 may be performed at any time before, during, or after performing steps 140 and 142 above.<br>
The following steps 148 - 154 must be performed after the step 146•  In step 148 the attachment and dielectric surfaces are moved together with the connectors aligned with the interconnectors* If there are multiple chip sites then preferably the chips are placed sequentially preferably in one process step before any of the chips are reflowed. Preferably, the interconnect substrate is optically aligned with the attachment substrate for example by using the machine vision system described above. Preferably, flux is applied to clean any oxide off the connectors and interconnectors during reflow. The flux may be a water-clean flux which forms a residue which can be rinsed off using water after reflow. Preferably, the flux is a no-clean flux which leaves an inert residue which can be identified as residue of no-clean flux.<br>
In step 150 the attachment and interconnect substrates are maintained in about fixed relative position together and heated by directed hot forced air, contact with a heating head, directed infra red (IR) radiation, a vapor phase heating chamber, or preferably by a convection and/or conduction reflow oven. Preferably, during reflow the attachment substrate is allowed to float on the joining material between the connectors and interconnectors and move into^ precise alignment by forces generated by the surface tension of the joining material, acting on the connectors and interconnectors.<br>
In step 152 the attachment and interconnect substrates cool together to attach them together. Typically they are<br><br>
moved out of the oven or the source of heat is removed and the package cools by interaction with ambient air to form a solid joint between the connections and interconnections.<br>
In step 154, encapsulant is dispensed in the volume between the semiconductor surface and the dielectric surface around the joints. Eutectic solder between connection pads on the chip and interconnect pads on the attachment surface result in joints that bulge substantially from the pads. Providing bumps of HMT solder provides much more separation and much less bulging with the same volume of solder. Preferably, the encapsulant is an organic material (preferably epoxy) and is preferably filled with glass particles to provide a CTE intermediate between the semiconductor base material and the interconnection substrate*<br>
Step 156 is optional since the module may ba a circuit-board assembly which may not require further connection to another substrate or may be a chip carrier requiring connectors to connect the chip carrier module to a circuit-board. In step 156 terminals are provided to connect the module to another substrate such as a circuit-board. The terminals may be peripheral leads such as gull-wing, J-wing, I-wing, with .3, .4, .635 or 1.27 mm spacing (or an intermediate spacing) clipped to the edge of the substrate. Alternatively, the terminals may be pins extending through the attachment substrate to form conductive vias. Alternately, the terminals may be bumps such as solder balls attached to a surface of the transfer substrate. For example after screening LJT solder paste on flat 1.0 mm connector pads on 1.27 mm spacing (more preferably about ,635 nun spacing), then 1.1 mm dia preformed balls of HMT solder may be placed on the paste and the paste reflowed to connect the balls to the terminal pads.<br><br>
For example, on a ceramic substrate with a dry deposited copper wiring layer on the top surface, gull-wing leads are clipped onto the substrate on the pads at .3 mm centers along all four edges- A stencil is positioned on the top surface of a ceramic substrate and HMT solder paste is deposited on the peripheral pads and a rectangular row of connection pads for a wire bond chip. The assembly is placed in an IR oven and reflowed, and then removed from the oven to cool. The stencil is removed, and the wirebond chip is placed with flat peripheral wirebond pads on the reflowed HMT solder bumps of the ceramic substrate. Then the assembly is reflowed again to connect the HMT solder directly to the wire bond chip pads. Then the volume between the chip and ceramic surface around the connections is filled with encapsulant.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the process of the invention for producing a bump array chip carrier. In step 170, an attachment substrate with an attachment surface and a carrier surface is formed. This step is similar to the step 140 in Fig. 2 of forming a chip carrier substrate. The attachment and carrier surfaces can be on opposite side of the attachment substrate or on the same side of the substrate. If on the same side the carrier surface is preferably enclosed by a symmetric border of attachment surface.<br>
In step 172 coupling pads are formed on the carrier surface for coupling a chip to the attachment substrate. Multiple sets of coupling pads may be provided for multiple chips. The pads may be flat pads for flip-chips or bumped pads for unbumped flip or wire bond chips as described above for step 142 of Fig. 2. Alternately, the pads may be flat pads for bonding wires between the coupling pads and wire bond chips.<br>
In step 174 a plurality of connectors are formed on the attachment surface for connecting the carrier to<br><br>
another substrate such as a circuit-board. The connectors may be flat connector pads or bumps may be formed on the flat connector pads.  The same HMT materials may be used to form the bumps as described for step 112 above for HMT bumps on flip-chips. The HMT material should be joinable to the pads at a temperature that will not damage the attachment substrate, or wiring layer. For example, a HMT solder may be selectively applied to the connector pads and reflowed to form bumps (balls) in site.  HMT solder may be applied by dry deposition over photo-patterned resist or by dry depositing a thin layer over which additional solder is electroplated. More preferably any HMT solder is transferred from a transfer substrate by reflowing as described below. Then the deposited solder is reflowed to form bumps or balls of solder. Alternatively, LJT material may be screened onto the flat connector pads and preformed shapes of HMT solder may be placed on the pads, and then the LJT heated to. connect the preforms to the pads to form connector- Another alternative is to deposit sticky flux onto the connector pads and then place preforms on the pads and then heating to connect the preforms to the pads.<br>
Preferably, the connectors are 0.3 to 2.0 mm wide with centers spaced in rows at 1.1 to 3 times their width, more preferably the connectors are 0.35 to 1.1 mm wide and spaced less than 2 times their width. Preferably, the reflowed bumps have sufficient solder to extend more than about 10% of the diameter of the connector pads out from the substrate more preferably they extend more than about 40% to 180% of the pad diameter, and most preferably extend 80% to 150% Alternatively preformed balls of HMT solder may be placed on sticky flux on the pads and reflowed at high temperature or welded to the pads. Another alternative is to screen LJT material (solder, conductive adhesive, TLP material) on the connector pads, place the ball on the pads, and then heat to adhere the balls to the pads. The<br><br>
larger the connector pads and the further the bumps extend, the lower the thermal fatigue, but the size of pads and balls that can be reliably formed and reflowed without solder bridging is limited by the spacing between the connector pads. After reflow the solder may be flattened using a pneumatic flattener to press an anvil against the attachment surface to produce a flat area on the distal ends of the balls. Flattening is especially advantageous when the attachment substrate is to be placed on hemispherical ended bumps on an interconnect substrate since confronting un-flattened bumps tend to interact to bias the chip carrier out of position.<br>
In step 176 conductors are formed between the coupling pads and connectors. Where the coupling pads and connectors are within a single wiring layer the conductors are preferably wires within the wiring layer. The conductors may also be routed through conductive vias to another layer especially where multiple wiring layers are specialized for certain directions or where the coupling pads are accessed from a different side of the attachment substrate than the connectors.<br>
In steps 178 a transfer substrate is produced with a transfer surface, and in step 180 a plurality of holes are formed on the transfer surface in a mirror image arrangement to the plurality of connectors, with walls that are significantly less adhesive to the joining material than the connectors. The above discussion for steps 114 and 116 about forming a transfer substrate with transfer surface and forming holes in a mirror image to connectors, respectively is applicable to step 178 and 180,<br>
The size of the holes in the transfer substrate depends on the type of joining material and the desired volume of joining material and the spacing between holes. For example, for a plastic ball grid array with 0.8 mm peripheral connection pads spaced at 1,27 mm centers, 1 mm3<br><br>
of LJT solder paste which shrinks 50% in volume during reflow may be deposited using a 0.8 mm thick stencil with 1.1 mm square holes. The substrate and stencil are placed in a convection oven and reflowed to form 1.0 ram dia balls of LJT solder on the pads.<br>
The discussion for steps 118 - 126 for Fig.l above generally applies to steps 182 - 190. In step 182 joining material is provided in the holes; in step 184 the attachment and transfer surfaces are moved relatively together with the connectors aligned with the holes and in position to contact the joining material; in step 186 the connectors are heated in contact with the joining material; in step 188 the connectors and adhering joining materia is cooled, and in step 190 the transfer and attachment substrates are moved relatively apart with substantially all the joining material attached to the connectors.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the process for producing a bump array module of the invention. In step 200, an attachment substrate with an attachment surface and a carrier surface is formed. This step is similar to the step 140 in Fig. 2 of forming a chip carrier substrate. As in step 170 in Fig. 3, the attachment and carrier surfaces can be on the same or on opposite sides of the attachment substrate.<br>
In step 202 coupling pads are formed on the carrier surface for coupling a chip to the attachment substrate. This step is similar to steps 172 of Fig 3 and 142 of Fig. 2, described above.<br>
In step 204 a computer chip is connected to the coupling pads. For chips mounted face down this step may be the same as steps 144 - 152 of Fig. 2 described above. Alternatively other methods for bumping chips or coupling pads may be used. For example, bumps may be made by placing sticky flux on pads, placing preformed joining material on the pads, heating to form the bumps on the pads, and flattening the bumps if desired. For example flux and HMT<br><br>
solder is placed on face pads of a flip-chip, and the solder is reflowed to form bumps on the face pads, and flux and LJT solder preforms are placed on the coupling pads, ref lowed to form bumps, and flattened*  Then the flip-chip is placed on the substrate with the hemispherical HMT solder bumps on the flattened LJT solder, and then reflowed to connect the chip to the substrate. Bumps can also be made using a wire bond machine by forming a bump at the end of a wire bond wire, compression connecting the bump to the pad, and breaking the wire off at the bump. For wirebond chips, the back of the chip is bonded at the center of a rectangle of coupling pads using adhesive such as epoxy, and then aluminum or gold wires are bonded from bond pads on the chips to the connection pads on the carrier surface.<br>
The discussion of steps 174 -180 for Fig- 3 above generally applies to the following steps 206 - 212. In step 206 a plurality of connectors are formed on the attachment surface for connecting the module to another substrate such as a circuit-board.

The discussion for steps 118 - 126 for Fig 1 above generally applies to the following steps 214 - 222. In step 214 joining material is provided in the holes; in step 216 the attachment and transfer surfaces are moved relatively together with the connectors aligned with the holes and in position to contact the joining material; in step 218 the connectors are heated in contact with the joining material; in step 220 the connectors and adhering joining materia is cooled, and in step 222 the transfer and attachment<br><br>
substrates are moved relatively apart with substantially-all the joining material attached to the connectors.<br>
Fig* 5 illustrate a method of the invention for making a circuit-board assembly. In step 240 a circuit-board substrate with a coupling surface is formed*<br>
The substrate may be a dielectric coated metallic such as INVAR, Cu-INVAR-Cu, or Cu. Preferably, substrate is an organic such as a thermoset (e.g. FR-10, G-10), a polyimide, a PTFE, or a thermoplastic. Such organics are preferably filled with dielectric particles of ceramic or glass, or more preferably dielectric fibers even more preferably woven PTFE or glass fiber cloth* Organic and metal substrates may be coated with organic dielectrics such as polyimides, thermosets, thermoplastics 9  preferably a common solder resist is used. Ceramic substrates are very rarely used for attachment of modules due to expense, fragility, and weight.<br>
In step 242 a wiring layer is formed on the coupling surface including a plurality of coupling pads which adhere to a second joining material when heated. The pads are preferably about the same size as the pads on the module. The material of the wiring layer may be etched copper foil, or may be dry deposited or chemically and/or electrically deposited copper for a flexible laminated board or rigid organic board. The wiring layer may consist only of inter-connectors which may be only vias extending through the dielectric layer or may include lands surrounding such vias, but preferably the interconnectors are flat pads or bumps of copper.and the wiring layer includes conductors connected to the interconnectors, the conductors may connect between the interconnectors and conductive vias, other interconnectors for the semiconductor component, other interconnectors for other components, or interconductors for connecting from the wiring layer to another interconnect substrate. Preferably, the inter-<br><br>
connectors are copper.  The interconnectors may be coated with a thin layer of solder or an organic such as ### which is compatible with soldering to prevent oxidation of the interconnectors. Alternately a bump of HMT solder may be placed on an organic substrate as a preformed ball. The second joining material may be the same material used in producing the bumped chip module of Fig. 2, but preferably has a lower joining temperature than the melting temperature of the joining material of the bumped chip module. The interconnectors typically include multiple patterns for a plurality of surface mount components.<br>
In step 244 a bumped chip module is produced as described -aboye'&amp;for^Eig- 2*;<br>
In step 246 i:he-^attachment and dielectric surfaces are moved together with the connectors aligned with the interconnectors. If there are multiple component sites then preferably the components are placed sequentially preferably in one process step before any of the components are reflowed. Preferably, the interconnect substrate is optically aligned with the attachment substrate for example by using the machine vision system described above.<br>
In steps 248 the attachment and interconnect substrates are maintained in about fixed relative position together and heated by directed hot forced air, contact with a heating head, directed infra red (IR) radiation, a vapor phase heating chamber, or preferably by a convection and/or conduction reflow oven. Preferably, the attachment substrate is allowed to float on the joining material between the connectors and interconnectors and move slightly into precise alignment by surface tension forces of the joining material, acting on the connectors and interconnectors.<br>
In step 250 the attachment and interconnect substrates cool together to attach them together. Typically they are moved out of the oven or the source of heat is removed and<br><br>
the package cools by interaction with ambient air to form a solid joint between the connections and interconnections.<br>
In step 252, encapsulant is dispensed in the volume between the attachment surface and the dielectric surface around the joints. Eutectic solder between connection pads on the chip and interconnect pads on the attachment surface result in joints that bulge substantially from the pads. Providing bumps of HMT solder provides much more separation and much less bulging with the same volume of solder. Preferably, the encapsulant Is an organic material (preferably epoxy) and Is preferably filled with particles of a solid material to provide a CTE Intermediate between the base materials of the module and Interconnection substrate.<br>

In step 292 a plurality of metal pins are provided extending from connector ends at the attachment surface, through the attachment substrate, and outward to distal ends. Preferably, the pins form at least one row and more preferably two rows to provide a high number of connectors. Again this step may be performed while forming the substrate by molding slip around the pins to make greensheets, forcing the pins into greensheets, or forcing the pins through uncured B-stage fiberglass preforms* Alternately the pins may be placed into the holes for example by force fitting the pins into holes or bending or swaging the pins to hold them in the holes. The holes can be made at the time of forming the substrate such as by molding the substrate with holes already in place, or punching greensheets, or the holes may be formed after the substrate is formed by laser or mechanical drilling or punching. Preferably, the pins are highly conductive metal, such a aluminum or preferably copper, and more preferably at least the distal ends of the pins are coated with a thin<br><br>
non-oxidizing material such as nickel, chrome, silver, or preferably gold for improved electrical contact. Due to material costs, the layer should be as thin as possible while reliably preventing oxidation and providing good electrical contact over the life of the product. The connector ends may include flat heads formed against the attachment surface or spaced from the attachment surface.<br>

Preferably, the stencil is bowed as shown in Fig. 69 so that when screwed against the component it Is biased against the component by a spring force. During screening gravity and the blade also bias the stencil against the component. When the unit is removed then the spring force continues to bias the screen against the component to prevent joining material bridges between the holes from forming between the stencil and the component during heating to transfer the joining material.<br>

In 74a fiberglass cloth 1340 is moved through a reservoir 1342 of uncured liquid epoxy, and partially cured by heaters 1344, and cut with a knife 1346 to form prepregs 1348. In 74b a hydraulic press 1350 with heating elements 1352 laminates prepregs 1348 and copper foil 1354 together to form substrate 1356. In 74b a motor 1360 operates multiple drills 1362 which a hydraulic reservoir, pump, and control valve system 1364 lowers to form holes through substrate 1356. Alternately, the holes could be drilled using the laser system of 73g.

Magnets 1388 in the transfer substrate bias the stencil against the carrier substrate. The assembly is moved through a reflow oven of 73f to form solder bumps on the top and bottom surfaces of the carrier substrate. In 74g hydraulic bump flattener 1390<br><br>
