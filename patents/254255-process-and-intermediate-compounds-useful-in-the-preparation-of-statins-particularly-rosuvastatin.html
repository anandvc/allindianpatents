wherein<br>
R1 represents an alkyl group, such as a C1-6 alkyl group, and preferably an<br>
isopropyl group;<br>
R2 represents an aryl group, preferably a 4-fluorophenyl group;<br>

which comprises<br>
a)	hydroxylating a compound of formula (1):<br><br>
wherein Y represents a halo group, preferably CI or Br; P1 represents hydrogen or<br>
a protecting group, and W represents =O or -OP2, in which P2 represents<br>
hydrogen or a protecting group,<br>
to give a compound of formula (2):<br><br>
b)	oxidising the compound of formula (2) to give a compound of formula (3):<br>
	 1<br>
c)	coupling the compound of formula (3) with a compound of formula (4):<br><br><br>
wherein R3 represents a protecting group or an alkyl group, such as a C1-6 alkyl<br>
group, and preferably a methyl group; R4 represents a protecting group or a SO2R5<br>
group where R5 is an alkyl group, such as a C1-6 alkyl group, and preferably a<br>

and R7 and R8 each independently is an alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy group,<br>
preferably a phenyl group,<br>
to give a compound of formula (5):<br><br>
wherein R3 represents a protecting group or an alkyl group, such as a C1-5 alkyl<br>
group, and preferably a methyl group; and R4 represents a protecting group or a<br>
SO2R5 group where R5 is an alkyl group, such as a C1-6 alkyl group, and preferably<br>
a methyl group,<br>
d)	when W represents -OP2, removing any P2 protecting group and oxidising, the<br>
compound of formula (5) to give a compound of formula (6):<br><br>
and<br>
e)	subjecting the compound of formula (5) when W represents =O, or compound of<br>
formula (6) to ring-opening, removal of any P1 protecting groups, and optionally removing<br>
any additional protecting groups to give a compound of formula (7).<br>
In step (e), any P1 protecting groups and any additional protecting groups may be<br>
removed individually or together and prior to ring opening, during ring opening or after ring<br>
opening of the compounds of formula (5) or (6).<br>
Preferably, in steps (a) to (c), W is OP2 for the compounds of formula (1), (2), (3)<br>
and (5).<br>
Protecting groups which may be represented by P1 and P2 include alcohol<br>
protecting groups, examples of which are well known in the art. Particular examples<br><br>
include tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl and methyl groups, and optionally substituted variants<br>
thereof. Substituents may advantageously be used to modify the ease of introduction or<br>
 removal of the protecting group. Preferred protecting groups are silyl groups, for example<br>
triaryl- and especially trialkylsilyl groups. Especially preferred examples are trimethylsilyl,<br>
t-butyldimethylsilyl and t-butyldiphenylsilyl groups.<br>
Protecting groups which may be represented by P1 and P2 may be the same or<br>
different. When the protecting groups P1 and P2 are different, advantageously this may<br>
allow for the selective removal of only P1 or P2. Preferably, when the protecting groups P1<br>
and P2 are different, P1 is a tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, or silyl group and P2 is a methyl<br>
group. More preferably, when the protecting groups P1 and P2 are different, P1 is a<br>
benzyl, or silyl group and P2 is a methyl group.<br>
Protecting groups which may be represented by R3 and R4 include amine<br>
protecting groups, examples of which are well known in the art. Particular examples<br>
include benzyl groups, carbamates (such as CBZ, Boc, Fmoc), phosphate, thiophosphate,<br>
silyl groups and, when R3 and R4 together are a single protecting group, an imine group.<br>
Hyrdoxylation of compounds of formula (1) can be achieved by methods known in<br>
the art for displacing a halo group with a hydroxide source. Preferably, the process<br>
comprises contacting the compound of formula (1) with a source of hydroxide. Hydroxide<br>
sources include hydroxide salts, especially ammonium or alkali metal hydroxides,<br>
particularly lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide, and various aqueous media such as<br>
water in the presence of basic media such as N-methylpryrrolidinone, HMPA, Al2O3,<br>
CaCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3 or KO2/18-crown-6, silver salts such as AgNO3 or, Ag2O, or<br>
oxidants such perbenzioc acid. A particularly preferred process comprises contacting the<br>
compound of formula (1) with 5 molar equivalents of KOH in the presence of<br>
dimethylsulfoxide solvent at a temperature of, for example, about 50Â°C.<br>
Alternatively, hydroxylation may be achieved by first displacing the halogen with a<br>
leaving group such as acetate, triflate or sulphate optionally in the presence of a silver<br>
salt, then displacing the leaving group with a hydroxide source. A particularly preferred<br>
process comprises contacting the compound of formula (1) with 3 molar equivalents of<br>
NaOAc in the presence of dimethylformamide solvent and tetra-n-butylammonium chloride<br>
at a temperature of, for example, about 100Â°C, isolating the acetyl compound and<br>
contacting with potassium carbonate in the presence of methanol solvent and at a<br>
temperature of, for example, about 0Â°C.<br>
Oxidation of compounds of formula (2) can be achieved using oxidation systems<br>
known in the art for the oxidation of alcohols, especially those known in the art for the<br>
oxidation of primary alcohols. Examples include oxidation with Dess-Martin periodinane,<br>
bromine, Swern oxidation or various metal based oxidations such as Fetizon reagent,<br>
manganate based reagents, and chromate based reagents such as Collins reagent.<br>
Swern oxidation is preferred. When Swern oxidation is employed, preferred conditions<br><br>
comprise the use of dimethyl sulphoxide and oxalyl chloride or bromine in a solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane or dichlormethane/THF mixtures, at reduced temperature, such as<br>
, from 0 to -100Â°C, preferably -50 to -80Â°C. Preferably, reagents are added at reduced<br>
temperature, such as -30 to -80Â°C, and then once all reagents are added, the reaction<br>
mixture is allowed to warm to 15 to 20Â°C.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula (3) may be obtained directly from a<br>
compound of formula (1), for example by treatment with dimethysulphoxide and an acid<br>
acceptor.<br>
The coupling of the compound of formula (3) with the compound of formula (4)<br>
may employ conditions analogous to those given in WO01/85702 for the corresponding<br>
coupling of a compound of formula (4). Alternatively, conditions comprising refluxing the<br>
compounds of formula (3) and (4) in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as toluene or<br>
cycfohexane, or mixtures thereof, followed by contact with aqueous acid, such as aqueous<br>
HCI may be employed.<br>
Alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy groups which may be represented by R7 and R8<br>
include C^alkyl groups, slich as methyl and ethyl groups, C8-12aryl groups, such phenyl,<br>
tolyl or naphthyl, C1-6alkoy groups, such as ethoxy groups, and C6-10aryloxy groups such<br>
as phenoxy groups.<br>
Anions which may be represented by X include halide.<br>
R6 preferably is P(=O)R7R8 where R7 and R8 each independently is an alkyl, aryl,<br>
aikoxy or aryloxy group, preferably a phenyl group.<br>
When W represents OP2, the protecting group may be removed to form a hydroxy<br>
group by methods known in the art for the removal of the given protecting group. For<br>
example, silyl protecting groups may be removed by contact with a source of fluoride ion,<br>
such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
Oxidation of compounds formed by deprotection of compounds wherein W<br>
represents -OP2 may employ conditions known in the art for the oxidation of pyranols to<br>
pyranones, and include those given in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations", R.C.<br>
Larock, 2nd Ed (1999) p 1670, published by Wiley VCH, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferred oxidation systems include Ag2CO3/Celite, especially Celite J2, bromine or<br>
Swern.<br>
Ring opening of the compounds of formula (5), when W represent =0 or formula<br>
(6) may employ conditions known in the art for ring opening of a pyranone. Preferably,<br>
the ring is opened by contact with a base, such as sodium hydroxide or calcium oxide.<br>
Conveniently, polar solvents are employed, for example methanol, acetonitrile,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof.<br>
Remaining protecting groups may be removed by methods known in the art for the<br>
removal of the given protecting group. For example, silyl protecting groups may be<br>
removed by contact with a source of fluoride ion, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride,<br><br><br>
and benzyl -groups may be removed by treatment with TMSI or under selective<br>
hydrogenation conditions.<br>
It will also be recognised that compounds of formulae (2), (3) and (5) may also be<br>
subjected to oxidation (when W represents -OH) or deprotection and oxidation (when W<br>
represents (-O-protecting group) to form the corresponding compound wherein W<br>
represents =O.<br>

warm up to 20Â°C. Glacial acetic (5mls) acid was then charged to quench the reaction.<br>
Water (5mls) was also charged to the mixture. The solvent was then removed in vacuo<br>
and reconstituted with toluene (15mls) and water (15mls). The upper organic layer was<br>
then separated and the aqueous layer was then washed with ethyl acetate (15 mis). The<br>
combined organics were then dried and the solvent removed in vacuo to yield an oil<br>
containing a mixture of isomers, that can be purified by chromatography. The desired<br>
product had the tentative NMR assignment<br>
1H nmr CDCI3 1.2 (d, 6H), 1.6-1.9 (m 4H), 3.3 (s, 3H), 3.4 (s, 3H), 3.2 &amp; 3.5 (2 x s, 3H),<br>

The pyrimidyl-ethenyl-OH-lactol (35mg, 0.065mmol) in dichloromethane (0.5ml)<br>
was added to Dess-Martin periodinane (30mg, 0,07mmol) and stirred at room temperature<br>
for 2.5 hours. The reaction was partitioned between 1M sodium hydroxide and diethyl<br>
ether. The phases were then separated and the organic volume reduced in vaccuo to<br>
afford the crude product oil.<br><br><br>
Example 9 - Preparation of Rosuvastatin (hydrolysis of Lactone), a coumpound of<br>
Formula 7 where R1= iPr, R2= 4-FC6H4, R3=Me, R4=SO2Me<br>
The lactone (1.1g) was dissolved in ethanol (10ml). Water (2ml) and Ca(OH)2<br>
(0.15g) were added and the suspension warmed to 60Â°C for 3 hours. A further 10ml of<br>
warm water was added, then the mixture allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The<br>
precipitate formed was filtered and dried to give Rosuvastatin calcium salt. The material<br>
was identical to an authentic sample by mixed melting point, NMR and mass<br>
spectrometry.<br><br><br>
