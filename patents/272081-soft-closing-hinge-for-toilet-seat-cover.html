				<td>Field of Invention: This invention relates to Soft Closing Hinge for Toilet Seat Covers for Toilet Seats.<br>
Background:<br>
Heavier seat cover to provide stable and comfortable seat are used in toilets. The existing seat covers with conventional hinge mechanism suffer from many limitations. An inadvertent slip while closing the seat cover after use usually causes damages to seat cover and the Water Closet (WC) over which it is fitted. Again the impact of free fall of the seat cover is very noisy and distracting and sudden fall can cause injury to small children. Holding the seat to close the Water Closet is unhygienic. The above factors make it inconvenient.<br>
Conventional Soft close hinge system as described in EP1486154B1 is not a hydraulic hinge, rather a spring coiled to axis and squeezed between hinge translators to soften motion of toilet seat and cover. The mechanism of said system being a spring system the closing action cannot be as soft as hydraulic system and there is more possibility of wear and tear.<br>
Object:<br>
Object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks by providing "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers".<br>
Summary of Invention:<br>
A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover comprising:<br>
•	a casing with slots on the inner surface,<br>
•	a body with at least one rib to slide into corresponding slots in the casing,<br>
•	a stem having groove on one end and thereafter a plate fitted inside said body,<br>
an outer ring and an end cap fitted to both ends of said body, wherein high density liquid is filled between the stem and the body such that when the stem rotates in the body and the outer ring, it produces a soft closing action due to high viscosity of said high density liquid.<br>
The outer ring restricts the axial motion of the stem with the help of said plate.<br>
The casing has an inbuilt adjustment mechanism, which is slided based on center-to-center distance of holes provided on the sanitary ware.<br>
Different weights of seat cover varying from 900gms to 3000gms can be used by varying the amount of high-density liquid.<br>
Brief Description:<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the perspective view of assembled "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers".<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the exploded view of "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers".<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the solid view of "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers" with soft closing action.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the top view of toilet seat where "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers" is to be<br>
fitted.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the perspective view of casing of "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers".<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the sectional view of casing of "Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers".<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
Referring to the drawings, Soft Closing Hinge for Seat Covers (1), which includes a prominent rib (2) on outer surface of a hollow cylinder body (5), fitted to end cap (6) in one end, and a stem (4) in other end. Outer ring (3) is fitted on the other side of the body (5) in such a way that it restricts the axial movement of the stem (4). Said stem (4) has grooves at one end, which is to be fitted inside the body (5). The stem (4) has a plate (11) in the middle such that said stem fits into the body and the movement of the stem is restricted by arrangement of said plate (11) and<br>
outer ring (3). Said stem (4) is longer than said body (5) and fitted tightly to it. The stem (4) states in the body (5) and the outer ring (3) with a hydraulic action owing to the presence of high-density liquid. This rotation due to high level of viscosity of the high-density liquid between said stem (4) and the body (5) leads to the soft closing action of the seat and seat cover (12). The body (5) is fitted inside casing (10) in such a manner that said rib (2) slides into slot (9). It is then locked in one direction. Said slot (9) is provided inside the casing (10). Said casing has an inbuilt adjusting mechanism (13), which is slided based on center-to-center distance of holes (7) based on the sanitary ware (8). This Soft Closing Hinge Mechanism can be used with seat cover (12) of different weights, varying from 900 gms to 3000 gms. This is achieved by adjusting the amount of high-density liquid in the hinge mechanism.<br>
The advantages over the existing products are as follows:-<br>
-	Soft closing toilet seat cover is more durable and does not cause any damage to water<br>
closet.<br>
-	It is noiseless and convenient to use.<br>
-	It is child friendly as it precludes any chance of injury.<br>
-	It is hygienic.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined.   <br><br><br><br>
Claim:<br>
1.  A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover comprising:<br>
•	a casing with slots on the inner surface,<br>
•	a body with at least one rib to slide into corresponding slots in the casing,<br>
•	a stem having groove on one end and thereafter a plate fitted inside said body,<br>
•	an outer ring and an end cap fitted to both ends of said body, wherein high density<br>
liquid is filled between the stem and the body such that when the stem rotates in the<br>
body and the outer ring, it produces a soft closing action due to high viscosity of said<br>
high density liquid.<br>
2.	A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover as claimed in claim 1, wherein outer ring restricts the<br>
axial motion of the stem with the help of said plate.<br>
3.	A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover as claimed in claim 1, wherein said casing has an<br>
inbuilt adjustment mechanism, which is slided based on center-to-center distance of holes provided on the sanitary ware.<br>
4.	A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover as claimed in claim 1, wherein different weights of<br>
seat cover varying from 900gms to 3000gms can be used by varying the amount of high density liquid.<br>
5.	A soft closing hinge for toilet seat cover as claimed in claim 1, substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br></td>
