				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a novel cyclone separator for removing fine<br>
solid participates from a gas stream. The cyclone is especially applicable in a third stage<br>
separator apparatus, often used to purify the catalyst fines-laden flue gas stream exiting a<br>
refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst regenerator.<br>
[0002] The emission of particulates in industrial gas streams must be carefully<br>
controlled in light of federal, state, and local regulations designed to curtail pollution. In<br>
the area of oil refinery operations, a major concern regarding paniculate emissions lies in<br>
the flue gas exiting the catalyst regenerator section of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)<br>
units. Current United States federal regulations limit paniculate levels to 1 kg of solids<br>
per 1000 kgs of coke burned in the catalyst regenerator, or the equivalent of a flue gas<br>
paniculate concentration of approximately 80-110 mg/Nm^. Corresponding European<br>
regulations currently vary considerably, from 80-500 mg/Nm^; however, this value is<br>
expected to decline potentially to 50 mg/Nm^.<br>
[0003] FCC technology, now more than 50 years old, has undergone continuous<br>
improvement and remains the predominant source of gasoline production in many<br>
refineries. This gasoline, as well as lighter products, is formed as the result of cracking<br>
heavier (i.e. higher molecular weight), less valuable hydrocarbon feed stocks such as gas<br>
oil. Although FCC is a large and complex process involving many factors, a general<br>
outline of the technology is presented here in the context of its relation to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0004] In its most general form, the FCC process comprises a reactor that is closely<br>
coupled with a catalyst regenerator, followed by downstream hydrocarbon product<br>
separation. A major distinguishing feature of the process is the continuous fluidization<br>
and circulation of large amounts of catalyst having an average particle diameter of 50-<br>
100 microns, equivalent in size and appearance to very fine sand. For every ton of<br>
cracked product made, approximately 5 tons of catalyst are needed, hence the<br>
considerable circulation requirements. Coupled with this need for a large inventory and<br>
recycle of a small particle diameter catalyst is the ongoing challenge to prevent this<br>
catalyst from exiting the reactor/regenerator system into effluent streams.<br>
«<br>
[0005] Overall, the use of cyclone separators internal to both the reactor and<br>
regenerator has provided over 99% separation efficiency of solid catalyst. Typically, the<br>
regenerator includes first and second (or primary and secondary) stage separators for the<br>
purpose of preventing catalyst contamination of the regenerator flue gas, which is -<br>
essentially the resulting combustion product of catalyst coke in air. While normal-sized<br>
catalyst particles are effectively removed in the internal regenerator cyclones, fines<br>
material (generally catalyst fragments smaller than 50 microns resulting from attrition<br>
and erosion in the harsh, abrasive reactor/regenerator environment) is substantially more<br>
difficult to separate. As a result, the FCC flue gas will usually contain a particulate<br>
concentration in the range of 200-1000 mg/Nm^. This solids level can present difficulties<br>
related to either the applicable legal emissions standards or the desire to recover power<br>
from the flue gas stream. In the latter case, the solids content in the FCC flue gas may be<br>
sufficient to damage turbine blades of an air blower to the regenerator if such a power<br>
recovery scheme is indeed selected.<br>
[0006] A further reduction in FCC flue gas fines loading is therefore often warranted,<br>
and may be obtained from a third stage separator (TSS) device containing a manifold of<br>
cyclones. Electrostatic precipitators. are known to be effective for this gas/solid<br>
separation but are far more costly than a TSS, which relies on the induction of centripetal<br>
acceleration to a particle-laden gas stream, forcing the higher-density solids to the outer<br>
edges of a spinning vortex. To be efficient, a cyclone separator for an FCC flue gas<br>
effluent will normally contain many, perhaps 100, small individual cylindrical cyclone<br>
bodies installed within a single vessel acting as a manifold. Tube sheets affixing the<br>
upper and lower ends of the cyclones act to distribute contaminated gas to the cyclone<br>
inlets and also to divide the region within the vessel into sections for collecting the<br>
separated gas and solid phases.<br>
[0007] In the area of cyclone design, significant emphasis has been placed on socalled<br>
"reverse flow" types where incoming gas is added around a gas outlet tube<br>
extending from the inlet side of a cylindrical cyclone body. Particle-rich gas can be<br>
withdrawn from openings in the sidewall of the cyclone body, while clean gas essentially<br>
reverses flow from its initial path toward the end of the cyclone body opposite the gas<br>
inlet, badk toward the gas outlet. The gas outlet is a tube normally concentric with, and<br>
located within the cyclone body. These types of cyclones are described in US 5,514,271<br>
Bl and US 5,372,707 Bl, where the inventive subject matter is focused on the shape and<br>
distribution of the sidewall openings in order to minimize turbulent eddy formation that<br>
can re-entrain solids into the clean gas outlet. In US 5,643,537 Bl and parent US<br>
5,538,696 B1, devices are contemplated for use with this fundamental cyclone design to<br>
further extend, or improve the uniformity of, the vortex flow pattern and thereby increase<br>
separation efficiency.<br>
[0008] Unfortunately, the requirement by itself for a gas stream to reverse direction<br>
and exit the cyclone body on the same side as the gas inlet imposes flow disturbances<br>
that are not easily overcome. Cyclones of the type described in US 5,690,709 Bl, termed<br>
"uniflow", eliminate the re-entrainment of solids associated with the reversal of gas<br>
direction. In this case, clean gas moves continually downward and exits the cyclone body<br>
below a lower tube sheet, which serves as the physical boundary between the separated<br>
particles and purified gas. This design, however, also promotes non-uniform flow<br>
patterns, which are here associated with the discharge of particles at essentially right<br>
angles to the particle-laden gas vortex, through the open bottom in the cylindrical<br>
cyclone body. Again, the basic operation of the cyclone in this case involves a change in<br>
direction of gas flow that should ideally be avoided. Furthermore, the open bottom<br>
design provides a relatively large surface area for exiting "dirty" gas to enter the bodies<br>
of adjacent cyclones in an overall arrangement of cyclones, such as in a TSS. This<br>
communication of gas among cyclones reduces separation efficiency.<br>
[0009] Aside from general considerations about cyclone design, such as the induction<br>
of centripetal acceleration and the maintenance of a uniform flow pattern, further<br>
improvements in efficiency associated with any particular cyclone configuration must be<br>
verified through actual testing. Indeed, some proposed designs that were believed in<br>
principle to mitigate uneven flow patterns and localized eddy formation actually<br>
performed quite poorly in laboratory experiments. Even sophisticated computational<br>
fluid dynamics computer software has been found in some cases to be a poor predictor of<br>
TSS separation efficiency. Therefore, through extensive trial and error, coupled with the<br>
overall objective of refining the cyclone internal flow pattern, a significant improvement<br>
in fine particle separation from gas streams has been achieved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention is an improved cyclone for the separation of solid<br>
particulates from a gas stream. Many of these cyclones can be combined in a vessel for<br>
use as a third stage separator in the treatment of solid-contaminated gas streams, and in<br>
particular flue gas from a refinery fluid catalytic cracking unit or other solidcontaminated<br>
gas streams. The cyclone provides a high separation efficiency because a<br>
particulate-laden gas vortex is established and travels through the device with minimal<br>
flow pattern disturbances. The feed gas and exiting clean gas move in the same direction<br>
throughout the separation, and the clean gas, representing the bulk of the feed gas on a<br>
volume basis, is removed from the central portion of the vortex using a gas outlet tube<br>
extending with the cyclone body. Furthermore, solid particles are forced through<br>
openings in the sidewall of the cyclone body to prevent backflow and gas communication<br>
among adjacent cyclones, rather than discharged axially.<br>
[0011] The use of a plate or other structure to close off the bottom of cyclone body<br>
means that particle-laden gas can exit only through openings on the cylinder wall. Thus,<br>
the pressure drop across the area through which the gas discharges is generally higher<br>
than that for open bottom designs. This increase in pressure drop and gas velocity<br>
induces a more forceful ejection of particulates through the cylinder sidewall, thereby<br>
preventing re-entry of solids into the cyclone body or any adjacent cyclones operating<br>
upon the same principal. In effect, the slots through which the ^article-contaminated gas<br>
exits act as a "check valve" to prevent backflow and particle re-entrainment into the<br>
cyclone body.<br>
[0012] The cyclone of the present invention is effective for separating even fine dust<br>
particles as small as 4-5 microns in diameter from the feed gas stream. These solid<br>
contaminants would otherwise render the contaminated gas non-compliant with<br>
environmental regulations or possibly prove detrimental to the proper functioning of<br>
power recovery turbines.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019] The present invention applies to the purification of a broad range of solidcontaminated<br>
gas streams, and especially those containing dust particles in the 1-10 «m<br>
range. A number of commercial gas purification operations meet this description,<br>
including the treatment of effluent streams of solid catalyst fluidized bed processes, coal<br>
fired heaters, and power plants. Several well-known refinery operations rely on fluidized<br>
bed technology, such as a preferred embodiment of the process for converting methanol<br>
to light olefins, as described in US 6,137,022 Bl, using a solid zeolitic catalyst<br>
composition. Another area of particular interest lies in the purification of fluid catalytic<br>
cracking (FCC) effluent streams that contain entrained catalyst particles resulting from<br>
attrition, erosion, and/or abrasion under process conditions within the reactor.<br>
 [0020] As mentioned, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is a well-known oil refinery<br>
operation relied upon in most cases for gasoline production. Process variables typically,<br>
include a cracking reaction temperature of 400-600°C and a catalyst regeneration<br>
temperature of 500-900°C. Both the cracking and regeneration occur at an absolute<br>
pressure below 5 atmospheres. FIG. 1 represents a typical FCC process unit of the prior<br>
art, where a heavy hydrocarbon feed or raw oil in line 12 is contacted with a newly<br>
regenerated catalyst entering from a regenerated catalyst standpipe 14. This contacting<br>
occurs along a narrow section extending from the bottom of the reactor 10, known as the<br>
reactor riser 16. Heat from the catalyst vaporizes the oil, and the oil is thereafter cracked<br>
in the presence of the catalyst as both are transferred up the reactor riser into the reactor<br>
10 itself, operating at a pressure somewhat lower than that of the riser 16. The cracked<br>
light hydrocarbon products are thereafter separated from the catalyst using first stage 18<br>
and second stage 20 internal reactor cyclones and exit the reactor 10 through line 22 to<br>
subsequent fractionation operations. At this point, some inevitable side reactions<br>
occurring in the reactor riser 16 have left detrimental coke deposits on the catalyst that<br>
lower its activity. The catalyst is therefore referred to as being spent (or at least partially<br>
spent) and requires regeneration for further use. Spent catalyst, after separation from the<br>
hydrocarbon product, falls into a stripping section 24 where steam is injected in line 26<br>
to purge any residual hydrocarbon vapor. After the stripping operation, the spent catalyst<br>
is fed to the catalyst regenerator 30 using a spent catalyst standpipe 32.<br>
[0021] In the catalyst regenerator 30, a stream of air from line 34 is introduced<br>
through an air distributor 28 to contact the spent catalyst, burn coke deposited thereon,<br>
and provide regenerated catalyst. The catalyst regeneration process adds a substantial<br>
amount of heat to the catalyst, providing energy to offset the endothermic cracking<br>
reactions occurring in the reactor riser 16. Some fresh catalyst is added in line 36 to the<br>
base of the regenerator 30 to replenish catalyst exiting the reactor as fines material or<br>
entrained particles. Catalyst and air flow upward together along the combustor riser 38<br>
located within the regenerator 30 and, after regeneration (i.e. coke burn), are initially<br>
separated by discharge through a "T" disengager 40, also within the regenerator 30.<br>
Finer separation of the regenerated catalyst and flue gas exiting the disengager 40 is<br>
achieved using first stage 44 and second stage 46 regenerator cyclone separators within<br>
the catalyst regenerator 30. Regenerated catalyst is recycled back to the cracking reactor<br>
10 through the regenerated catalyst standpipe 14. As a result of the coke burning, the flue<br>
gas vapors exiting at the top of the regenerator in line 42 contain C02 and H,O, along<br>
with smaller amounts of other species. While the first stage 44 and second stage 46<br>
regenerator cyclone separators can remove the vast majority of the regenerated catalyst<br>
from the flue gas in line 42, fine catalyst particles, resulting mostly from attrition,<br>
invariably contaminate this effluent stream. The fines-contaminated flue gas therefore<br>
typically contains 200-1000 mg/Nm^ of particulates, most of which are less than 50<br>
microns in diameter. In view of this contamination level, and considering both<br>
environmental regulations as well as the option to recover power from the flue gas, the<br>
incentive to further purify the flue gas using a third stage separator (TSS) is significant.<br>
[0022] A typical TSS of the prior art, containing numerous individual cyclones, is<br>
shown in FIG. 2. The TSS vessel 50 is normally lined with refractory material 52 to<br>
reduce erosion of the metal surfaces by the entrained catalyst particles. The finescontaminated<br>
flue gas from the FCC regenerator enters the top of the TSS at its inlet 54<br>
above an upper tube sheet 56 that retains the top ends 58 of each cylindrical cyclone<br>
body 62. The contaminated gas stream is then distributed among cyclone feed gas inlets<br>
60 and contacted with one or more swirl vanes 64 proximate these inlets to induce<br>
centripetal acceleration of the particle-contaminated gas. The swirl vanes are structures<br>
within the cyclone body that have the characteristic of restricting the passageway through<br>
which incoming gas can flow, thereby accelerating the flowing gas stream. The swirl<br>
vanes also change the direction of the contaminated gas stream to provide a helical or<br>
spiral formation of gas flow through the length of the cyclone body. This spinning<br>
motion imparted to the gas sends the higher-density solid phase toward the wall of the<br>
cyclone body 62.<br>
[0023] The cyclone design shown in FIG. 2 represents the so-called " uniflow"<br>
apparatus where a bottom end 66 of the cyclone body 62 is open, allowing solid particles<br>
that have been thrown near the wall of this cylinder to fall into the space 68 between the<br>
upper and lower tube sheets. Clean gas, flowing along the centerline of the cyclone body,<br>
passes through an inlet 70 of a gas outlet tube 72 before reaching the bottom end 66 of<br>
the cyclone body 62. The clean gas is then discharged via the gas outlet tube 72 below a<br>
lower tube sheet 74. The combined clean gas stream, representing the bulk of the finescontaminated<br>
flue gas, then exits through a gas outlet 76 at the bottom of the TSS vessel<br>
50. The separated particles and a minor amount (typically less than 10% of the finescontaminated<br>
flue gas) of underflow gas are removed through a separate paniculate and<br>
underflow gas outlet 78 at the bottom of the TSS 50.<br>
[0024] In FIG. 3, an individual cyclone separator 100 of the present invention, also<br>
affixed between an upper tube sheet 102 and a lower tube sheet 104, is shown. The<br>
cyclone 100 comprises an essentially vertical cyclone body 106 having a closed bottom<br>
end 108 with the cyclone body fixed at its top end 110 to the upper tube sheet 102. The<br>
closed bottom end 108 is preferably in the form of a horizontal plate. The cyclone body<br>
defines a feed gas inlet 112 at its top end 110 for receiving a particle-contaminated gas<br>
stream (e.g. a fines-contaminated flue gas stream) from above the upper tube sheet 102.<br>
Also, the cyclone body further defines a plurality of openings 114 for discharging gas.<br>
These openings 114 are between the upper, tube sheet 102 and the lower tube sheet 104,<br>
and are generally located in the lower portion of the cyclone body 106. Preferably, these<br>
openings 114 are proximate the bottom end 108 and extend upward from it. These<br>
openings allow for the discharge of particles along with a minor amount of an underflow<br>
gas, typically less than 10% of the particle-contaminated gas by volume, between the<br>
upper tube sheet 102 and the lower tube sheet 104. Closure of the bottom end 108<br>
induces a high gas velocity and pressure drop through the discharge openings 114 by<br>
providing relatively little surface over which the exiting gas can escape. This leads to an<br>
overall improved separation.<br>
[0025] One or more swirl vanes 116 are located proximate the gas inlet at the top of<br>
the cyclone to induce centripetal acceleration of the particle-contaminated gas stream. A<br>
gas outlet tube 118 is located centrally within the cyclone body 106, extends through the<br>
closed bottom end 108, and further extends upward through the lower tube sheet 104.<br>
The top and bottom ends of this gas outlet tube 118 define, respectively, a clean gas inlet<br>
120 for receiving a purified gas stream from within the cyclone body 106 and near its<br>
centerline, and a clean gas outlet 122 below the lower tube sheet 104 for discharging the<br>
purified gas stream. The clean gas inlet 120 is generally located above the discharge<br>
openings 114. The clean gas outlet 122 can be located anywhere below the bottom end<br>
108. As mentioned, the cyclone body 106 is oriented generally vertically, so that<br>
separation of the solid phase is assisted by gravity. Preferably, the cyclone body is in the<br>
form of a vertical cylinder, however, other shapes are certainly possible, including, for<br>
example, a cone shape.<br>
[0026] As noted previously, the major advantage of this design is that it provides a<br>
very uniform vortex of swirling gas that is essentially undisturbed along its downward<br>
path through the cyclone body and gas outlet tube. A further advantage is related to the<br>
increased pressure drop accompanying the ejection of particulate-rich gas through the<br>
cylinder wall openings. These openings provide a relatively small surface area for gas to<br>
exit, compared to the larger bottom ring-shaped surface between the cyclone body and<br>
the gas outlet tube, used in the aforementioned uniflow cyclone designs. As a result, each<br>
opening provides a type of "check valve" through which backflow of discharged gas, a<br>
cause of reduced separation efficiency, is substantially eliminated.<br>
[0027] The uniformity in gas flow is maintained in part through the use of a plurality<br>
of openings on the cyclone cylinder body for discharge of particles and a small amount<br>
of underflow gas. The openings may be of virtually any shape and located anywhere on<br>
the cyclone cylinder body, although it is preferred that at least some of these openings are<br>
near the closed bottom end of the cyclone to prevent an accumulation of solid particles in<br>
this region. The openings may also be of varying shapes, for example, slots and holes,<br>
and located at various elevations on the cyclone body. Preferably, at least some of the<br>
openings are in the form of rectangular slots with their major dimension (length)<br>
substantially parallel to the axis of the cyclone body, as depicted in FIG. 3. These slots<br>
are normally spaced uniformly about the circumference of the cyclone body. Also, the<br>
vertical slot lengths usually range from 5% to 25% of the length of the cyclone body. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the lower ends of the rectangular slots are adjacent to the closed<br>
bottom of the cyclone body.<br>
[0028] To further promote flow uniformity and thereby improve overall solid-gas<br>
separation efficiency, that the gas discharge openings are inclined from a radial direction.<br>
This allows gas to exit the cyclone body without a substantial change in its swirling,<br>
tangential flow direction, as established within the cyclone body. An example of this<br>
desired configuration is illustrated in FIG. 4, where the slots 114 also have edges 200 that<br>
are beveled (i.e. not normal to the line tangent to the circular cross section of the cyclone<br>
body 106 where the slots 114 are located). This beveling with respect to the curvature of<br>
the cyclone body 106 has the desired effect of allowing gas to exit the cyclone body 106<br>
with a significant tangential velocity component and minimal change from the direction<br>
of gas flow within the cyclone body. Also, the leading edge along the principal length of<br>
each rectangular slot may be slightly raised from the general curvature of the cyclone<br>
body to divert the gas flow in the desired tangential direction. Alternatively or<br>
concurrently, the trailing edge of the slot may be sunk into the general curvature for a<br>
similar effect.<br>
[0029] Furthermore, it has been determined that good solid/gas separation<br>
efficiencies are obtained when the openings are located below the clean gas inlet, which<br>
is also represented in FIG. 3. The total open area through which spinning gas may be<br>
discharged is preferably from 0.05% to 5% of the surface area of the cyclone body. This<br>
parameter, of course, depends on several factors including solid contaminant<br>
concentration, average particle size, gas flow rate, and pressure. When multiple cyclones<br>
of the present invention are used in the design of a third stage separator (TSS) for an<br>
FCC refinery unit, the separator performance efficiency preferably includes a d50<br>
particle size of below 5 microns. As understood in the art, the d50 value represents the<br>
diameter of a dust particle that is 50% removed in the underflow gas of the TSS.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the purified gas stream has a concentration of<br>
particles of 5 microns or greater that is less than 50% of the concentration of particles of<br>
5 microns or greater in the catalyst fines-contaminated flue gas stream.<br>
[0030] The performance benefit obtained using the cyclone of the present invention<br>
is further clarified in the following examples, which provide laboratory test data from<br>
experiments designed to simulate conditions found in FCC flue gas effluent streams.<br>
Although the following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the cyclone<br>
separator of the present invention, they are not intended to limit the overall scope of the<br>
invention as set forth in the claims.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1-7<br>
[0031] The previously mentioned "uniflow" type cyclone separators of the prior art<br>
were compared in performance to various cyclone separators according to the present<br>
invention. Separation of paniculate matter of 40 microns in diameter and smaller from a<br>
flowing gas stream was investigated. The cyclone separator in each test included a 280<br>
mm i.d. cylindrical body with a 130 mm gas outlet tube concentric with the cylinder and<br>
extending from 250 mm above, to well below, the bottom of the cylinder.<br>
[0032] In the comparative tests, except for this gas outlet tube extension, the bottom<br>
of the cylinder was open, although a disk was mounted on the exterior of the gas outlet<br>
tube 130 mm below the cylinder bottom. Separated particulates, having been discharged<br>
at essentially right angles to the spinning feed gas flow, were collected, along with a<br>
minor amount of underflow gas, in a dust hopper surrounding the cylindrical cyclone<br>
body. Both this gas and the clean (overflow) gas exiting through the gas outlet tube were<br>
analyzed for solid contamination levels as well as the particle size distribution of these<br>
contaminants. Likewise, these analyses were performed on the feed gas.<br>
[0033] In each separate experiment, the feed gas inlet flow rate to the cyclone was<br>
maintained at 0.45-0.50 Nm^/sec. This gas contained 300-400 mg/Nm^ of solids with a<br>
median particle diameter of 10-20 microns. After exiting the swirl vanes near the gas<br>
inlet, the gas velocity gas was accelerated due to the flow restriction effected by these<br>
vanes. The gas discharged with the bulk of separated solids, called the underflow gas,<br>
represented either 1% or 3% by volume of the feed gas, depending on the specific test.<br>
After each test, the efficiency of solid paniculate removal was calculated as a weight<br>
percentage of the feed solids that were removed in the underflow gas. The percentage of<br>
solid particles in this stream of less than 10 microns in diameter was also determined,<br>
along with the calculated estimate of the particle diameter for which 50% removal would<br>
be achieved (the d50 value).<br>
[0034] Results for these comparative examples are summarized in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) EXAMPLES 8-12<br>
[0035] The cyclone separator of the present invention was tested, by including in the<br>
cyclone design a horizontal base that was used to close the bottom of the cylinder body.<br>
In accordance with the description of the present invention, the solid particulates were in<br>
this case discharged from the spinning feed gas through openings in the cyclone cylinder<br>
sidewall. This was achieved by forming two rectangular slots of 90 mm in length and 10<br>
mm in width. The length was parallel to the axis of the cylindrical cyclone body, and the<br>
lower width dimension was adjacent to the horizontal base closing the bottom of the<br>
cyclone body. The conditions of the feed gas flow rate, paniculate level, and average<br>
paniculate diameter were maintained within the ranges given in the Comparative<br>
Examples. Again, studies were performed using underflow values of 1% and 3% by<br>
volume. Also, the same performance parameters were evaluated and are given in Table 2.<br>
(Table Removed) [0036] From the above test results, it is evident that the cyclone of the present<br>
invention, when compared to the open-bottom " uniflow" cyclone of the prior art,<br>
provides greater efficiency of solid particulate removal at both the 1% and 3% underflow<br>
conditions. This is illustrated graphically in FIG. 5. Furthermore, the cyclone separator of<br>
the present invention is superior for removing particulates of 4-5 microns in diameter,<br>
which are relevant for the overall improvement of FCC third stage separator designs. The<br>
increased ability of the present invention cyclone separator to separate small particulates,<br>
based on its d50 performance parameter, is illustrated in FIG. 6. Lastly, in contrast to the<br>
results in the Comparative Examples for cyclone separators of the prior art, the cyclone<br>
separator of the present invention consistently achieved a clean (overflow) gas solids<br>
contamination level of less than 50 mg/Nm, in compliance with current and even<br>
potential future legislation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
