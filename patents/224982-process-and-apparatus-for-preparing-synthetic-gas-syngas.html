				<td>PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PREPARING SYNTHETIC GAS (SYNGAS)<br>
Background of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the production of a synthesis gas (syngas) using a<br>
partial oxidation (POX) reactor and a reforming exchanger.<br>
Reforming of hydrocarbons is a standard process for the production of<br>
hydrogen-containing synthesis gas used for ammonia or methanol, for example.<br>
Conventional POX reactors are unpacked, free-flow, non-catalytic gas generators<br>
to which preheated hydrocarbon gas and oxygen are supplied, optionally with a<br>
temperature moderator. The partial oxidation reactor effluent is then quenched or<br>
cooled, typically to 200-300°C, optionally cleaned to remove soot, and usually<br>
further converted in high and low temperature shift converters wherein CO and<br>
steam react to form additional hydrogen and CO2. Syngas with high hydrogen<br>
content is especially desirable for ammonia or other synthesis processes where<br>
hydrogen is the main reactant from the syngas. The steam to hydrocarbon weight<br>
ratio in the POX reactor feed is generally from 0.1 to 5, the atomic ratio of oxygen<br>
to carbon in the hydrocarbon is in the range from 0.6 to 1.6, and reaction times<br>
vary from 1 to 10 seconds.<br>
POX reactors are described, for example, in US Patents 2,896,927;<br>
3,920,717; 3,929,429; and 4,081,253, which are hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br><br>
POX reactors produce a syngas effluent at a very high temperature prior to<br>
quenching, e.g. from 1100° to 1650°C. This means that much of the hydrocarbon<br>
feed must, in effect, be used as a rather expensive fuel to preheat feeds and<br>
generate high- or medium-pressure steam. However, the steam production is<br>
usually far in excess of plant requirements and must therefore be exported, and<br>
frequently there is little or no market for the steam.<br>
There is a need in the art for a way to improve efficiency of hydrogen plants<br>
that use POX reactors and reduce or eliminate the steam export. It is also<br>
frequently desired to maximize or increase hydrogen production from an existing<br>
hydrogen plant; however, the POX reactor is frequently a capacity-limiting<br>
operation. POX reactors cannot easily be expanded to increase production.<br>
The present invention addresses these needs by supplying the partially<br>
cooled POX reactor process effluent to the shell side of a reforming exchanger to<br>
provide heat for additional syngas production. Reforming exchangers used with<br>
autothermal reformers are known, for example, from US Patents 5,011,625 and<br>
5,122,299 to LeBlanc and 5,362,454 to Cizmer et al, all of which are hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These reforming exchangers are<br>
available commercially under the trade designation KRES or Kellogg Reforming<br>
Exchanger System.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The present invention uses a reforming exchanger in parallel with a partial<br>
oxidation (POX) reactor in a new hydrogen plant with improved efficiency and<br><br>
reduced steam export, or in an existing hydrogen plant. In one embodiment, the<br>
hydrogen capacity can be increased by as much as 20 to 30 percent with reduced<br>
export of steam from the hydrogen plant. The resulting process has very low<br>
energy consumption.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing syngas, comprising<br>
partially oxidizing a first hydrocarbon portion with oxygen in a partial oxidation<br>
reactor to produce a first reactor effluent; cooling the first reactor effluent to a<br>
temperature of 650°C to 1000°C, said cooling including direct heat exchange with<br>
water introduced into the first reactor effluent as a quench fluid; supplying the cooled<br>
first reactor effluent to a reforming exchanger; passing a second hydrocarbon portion<br>
with steam through a catalyst zone in the reforming exchanger to form a second reactor<br>
effluent, wherein the first and second hydrocarbon portions are supplied in a weight<br>
ratio of from 40:60 to 60:40; discharging the second reactor effluent from the catalyst<br>
zone to form an admixture with the first reactor effluent; passing the admixture across<br>
the catalyst zone in indirect heat exchange therewith to cool the admixture and heat the<br>
catalyst zone; and collecting the cooled admixture from the reforming exchanger.<br>
The cooling can include introducing water into the first reactor effluent as a<br>
quench fluid, indirect heat exchange, or a combination of water quenching and<br>
indirect heat exchange. The indirect heat exchange can be used to preheat the<br>
second hydrocarbon portion in a cross exchanger. The catalyst zone can include<br>
catalyst tubes. The method can also include supplying the second hydrocarbon<br>
portion to a tube side of the reforming exchanger and passing it through the<br>
catalyst tubes, and supplying the cooled first reactor effluent to a shell side inlet of<br><br>
the reforming exchanger. The shell side inlet can be adjacent an outlet end of the<br>
catalyst tubes. The method can further include supplying the first and second<br>
hydrocarbon portions in a weight ratio of from 40:60 to 95:5. More desirable, the<br>
first and second hydrocarbon portions can be supplied in a weight ratio of from<br>
40:60 to 60:40 (for more efficient hydrogen production), or from 80:20 to 95:5 (if<br>
more CO is desired).<br>
The present invention also provides a syngas production apparatus. The<br>
apparatus includes: (a) partial oxidation reactor means for partially oxidizing a<br>
first hydrocarbon portion with oxygen to produce a first reactor effluent; (b) means<br>
for cooling the first reactor effluent to a temperature from 650° to 1000°C;)(c)<br>
means for supplying the first reactor effluent to a reforming exchanger; (d) means<br>
for passing a second hydrocarbon portion with steam through a catalyst zone in the<br>
reforming exchanger to form a second reactor effluent; (e) means for discharging<br>
the second reactor effluent from the catalyst zone to form an admixture with the<br>
first reactor effluent; (f) means for passing the admixture across the catalyst zone<br>
in indirect heat exchange therewith to cool the admixture and heat the catalyst<br>
zone; and (g) means for collecting the cooled admixture from the reforming<br>
exchanger.<br>
The present method further provides a method for retrofitting a syngas<br>
process comprising a partial oxidation reaction step for converting a first<br>
hydrocarbon stream to a first reactor effluent, a heat recovery step for cooling the<br>
first reactor effluent and producing steam with the recovered heat, and a<br><br>
downstream processing step for receiving the cooled reactor effluent and<br>
producing a product syngas of enhanced hydrogen content. The retrofit includes:<br>
(a) a step for partially cooling the first reactor effluent to a temperature from 650°<br>
to 1000°C; (b) a step for diverting the partially cooled first reactor effluent to a<br>
reforming exchanger; (c) a step for passing a second hydrocarbon portion with<br>
steam through a catalyst zone in the reforming exchanger to form a second reactor<br>
effluent; (d) a step for discharging the second reactor effluent from the catalyst<br>
zone to form an admixture with the first reactor effluent; (e) a step for passing the<br>
admixture across the catalyst zone in indirect heat exchange therewith to cool the<br>
admixture and heat the catalyst zone; and (f) a step for supplying the admixture<br>
from the reforming exchanger to the heat recovery step.<br>

embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The retrofit candidate plants for the present invention have the general<br>
configuration shown in Fig. 1. Desulfurized natural gas or other hydrocarbon<br>
supplied from line 2 is mixed with process steam from line 4 and the mixture is<br><br>
preheated in a feed preheat exchanger (not shown). The preheated steam-<br>
hydrocarbon mixture is fed via line 6 to a POX reactor 8 (or a plurality of POX<br>
reactors) with oxygen 10 and the effluent is collected in line 12, quenched with<br>
water injected via line 14, and then supplied to downstream processing 15 that can<br>
include a shift section (high temperature, medium temperature and/or low<br>
temperature shift converters), heat recovery, CO2 removal (pressure swing<br>
absorption or PSA, for example), and the like. A hydrogen-rich syngas stream 17<br>
is produced.<br>
The plant of Fig. 1 is retrofitted, or a new plant is built, in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention as shown in Fig. 2. The POX reactor(s) 8<br>
and lines 2, 4, 6, 10 are conventional as described in reference to Fig. 1. The<br>
process effluent in line 12 from the POX reactor(s) 8 is quenched with process<br>
water via line 14 to 700°-1100°C, desirably 750°-1000°C, and the mixture supplied<br>
via line 16 to the shell-side inlet of the reforming exchanger 18. A heat exchanger<br>
15 can be used in addition to, or in lieu of, quench line 14. The heat exchanger 15<br>
can be used to preheat feed stream 19.<br>
A preheated mixture in line 19 of steam and hydrocarbon, which can be the<br>
same or different as the hydrocarbon in line 2, is supplied to a tube-side inlet of the<br>
reforming exchanger 18. The mixture passes through the catalyst tubes 20 to form<br>
 additional hydrogen-containing gas. The reformed gas from outlet openings of the<br>
catalyst tubes 20 mixes with the POX reformer effluent and the mixture passes<br>
across the outside of the catalyst tubes 20 to the shell-side outlet where it is<br><br>
collected in line 22 in a conventional manner. The combined syngas in line 22 is<br>
then supplied to conventional downstream processing 24 as in Fig. 2, which can<br>
include a shift converter, a heat exchange unit for the recovery of heat, and further<br>
purification, producing purified molecular hydrogen. In the retrofit application, the<br>
downstream processing units can be modified or expanded as necessary to handle<br>
the additional syngas supplied via line 22 that results from the addition of the<br>
reforming exchanger 18.<br>
The heat requirement for the reforming exchanger 18 is met by the quantity<br>
and temperature of the POX reactor effluent. Generally, the more feed in line 19 to<br>
the reforming exchanger 18, the more heat required from the POX reactor effluent<br>
16 to sustain the generally endothermic reforming reaction in the catalyst tubes 20.<br>
The temperature of the reformer catalyst tube effluent gas is desirably as hot as the<br>
materials of construction of the reforming exchanger 18 will allow, e.g. from 750°<br>
to 1000°C in the standard KRES unit. If the temperature is too low, insufficient<br>
reforming can occur in the reforming exchanger 18, whereas if the temperature is<br>
too high the metallurgical considerations might become problematic. Care should<br>
also be taken to ensure that the temperature is selected to minimize metal dusting.<br>
The proportion of hydrocarbon feed to the POX reactor(s) 8 can range from<br>
40 to 95 percent of the total, whereas the proportion to the reforming exchanger 18<br>
can be from 5 to 60 percent of the total hydrocarbon feed. The feed split between<br>
the POX reactor(s) 8 and the reforming exchanger 18 is desirably such that the<br>
POX reactor(s) 3 must produce a suitable volume of hot effluent to provide the<br><br>
heat requirements of the reforming exchanger 18. A feed split to the POX<br>
reactor(s) 8 of from 40 to 60 percent of the total is beneficial for improved energy<br>
efficiency and maximizing the hydrogen production rate, whereas feeding from 80<br>
to 95 percent of the total hydrocarbon feed to the POX reactor(s) 8 is beneficial for<br>
making more CO in the syngas.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by way of an example. Preliminary<br>
process design parameters for an integrated POX-reforming exchanger unit<br>
installed as in Fig. 2 were developed based on the retrofit of the typical POX<br>
process of Fig. 1 with the stream composition and flow rate for line 16 indicated in<br>
Table 1 below. Compositions, properties and flow rates for selected streams in the<br>
process modified in accordance with the configuration of Fig. 2 are also shown in<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
In the base case with a POX reactor only, the syngas produced from the<br>
reforming section of the plant will have the composition and flow rate of the POX<br>
reactor effluent in line 16. Using the reforming exchanger in parallel with the POX<br>
reactor according to this embodiment of the invention, the effluent in line 16 is<br>
mixed with the gas exiting the catalyst tubes 20 to obtain a syngas having the<br>
composition in line 22. This example shows that an integrated POX-reforming<br>
exchanger process can be used to recover waste heat in the reforming exchanger<br>
and increase hydrogen production by 20 to 25 percent. Using process heat for the<br>
additional hydrogen generation in this manner yields a corresponding reduction in<br>
steam export.<br>
The invention is described above with reference to non-limiting examples<br>
provided for illustrative purposes only. Various modifications and changes will<br>
