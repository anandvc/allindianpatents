60/829,793, entitled "Polymetal Hydroxychloride Processes and Compositions: Enhanced<br>
Efficacy Antiperspirant Salt Compositions", filed October 17, 2006 (attorney docket<br>
number 186931/US/3) by William E. Pratt and Joseph J. Stevens, the contents this<br>
provisional application of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] Polyaluminum chloride (PAC) is the name given to the family of compounds<br>
defined by the formula:<br>
[004]	Alm(OH)nCl3m.n<br>
[005] Where 0 
Al ratio) is known as the basicity. In the case of polyaluminum chlorides the basicity is<br>
defined by the formula n/3m. The highest basicity PAC of commercial interest is the<br>
polyaluminum chloride with ~83% basicity known as aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH); it<br>
has an empirical formula of Al2(OH)5Cl.<br>
[006] High basicity, high purity PAC, including ACH, is commonly used either alone or<br>
in combination with zirconium hydroxyl-halides to produce antiperspirants.<br>
Polyaluminum chloride, including ACH used for this purpose is prepared by the reaction<br>
of hydrochloric acid or aluminum chloride or low-basicity PAC with aluminum metal.<br>
Thus, US Patent 6,245,325 states that the reaction of hydrochloric acid with aluminum<br>
metal is generally known and is the method generally utilized to prepare high basicity<br>
PAC and ACH solutions on a commercial basis. US Patent 6,902,724 and references<br>
contained therein teach the reaction of aluminum chloride with aluminum metal to<br>
produce aluminum antiperspirant salt compositions. US Patent 2,854,382, US Patent<br>
 <br>
4,331,609, US Patent 4,775,528, US Patent 5,955,064, US Patent 6,126,928 and US<br>
Patent 6,902,724 teach the preparation of almninum-zirconium antiperspirant salt<br>
compositions whereby zirconium-hydroxyl chlorides are combined with high basicity<br>
PAC and or ACH that is prepared from aluminum metal as discussed above.<br>
[007] Aluminum metal is an expensive source of aluminum ion when compared to other<br>
sources of aluminum ion like aluminum trihydrate. Based on historical pricing<br>
relationships, aluminum from aluminum metal costs about three times as much as<br>
aluminum from aluminum trihydrate.<br>
[008] Aluminum and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirants have been known for several<br>
decades (see US Patent 2,854,382 (Grad), US Patent 4,331,609 (Orr) and US Patent<br>
4,871,525 (Giovanniello) and references contained therein). These products typically .<br>
contain an antiperspirant active in the form of an aluminum and/or zirconium salt; said<br>
salts are formed by partial neutralization of acidic aluminum (Al+3) and/or zirconium<br>
(Zr+4) metal ions.<br>
[009] The partial neutralization of these ions results in the formation of aluminum and<br>
zirconium hydrolysis products of complex structure. The performance (i.e., efficacy) of<br>
aluminum and ahuninum-zirconium antiperspirant salt compositions is dependent on the<br>
molecular distribution of these hydrolysis products. In general, low molecular weight<br>
hydrolysis products favor better performance by providing increased sweat inhibition.<br>
Low molecular weight antiperspirant salt compositions which provide increased sweat<br>
inhibition are said to have enhanced efficacy.<br>
[010] Aluminum and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirants salts function by forming<br>
insoluble metal hydroxides in the ducts of sweat glands, this blockage prevents<br>
perspiration. Low molecular weight antiperspirant salts penetrate more deeply into these<br>
ducts than their high molecular weight counterparts. Thus, deeper penetration provides<br>
more effective blockage. (See Quatrale, et. al., The Mechanim of Antiperspirant Action<br>
of Aluminum Salts, Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, May-June 1981,<br>
32:107-136 &amp; Journal Of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, Nov.-Dec. 1985, 36:435-<br>
440).<br>
 <br>
[011] High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing size exclusion columns<br>
is commonly used to characterize the molecular weight distribution and efficacy of<br>
aluminum and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts. Size exclusion chromatographic<br>
columns have a high affinity for low molecular weight materials and a low affinity for<br>
high molecular weight materials. This difference in affinity causes high molecular weight<br>
materials to be eluted more quickly than low molecular weight materials. Accordingly,<br>
this HPLC technique separates and identifies the components of aluminum and<br>
aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts with respect to molecular weight. Five distinct<br>
species have been identified by this technique. The highest molecular weight species is<br>
eluted first and referred to as Peak 1 material. The lowest molecular weight species is<br>
eluted last and referred to as Peak 5 material. Figure 2 shows a HPLC diagram of an<br>
aluminum antiperspirant salt. The relative area of each peak indicates the amount of the<br>
various components present. In this diagram Peaks 1 thru 3 have a greater relative area<br>
than Peaks 4 &amp; 5, indicating that this sample is primarily composed of high molecular<br>
weight, low efficacy components. (In some references authors have used the term "band"<br>
instead of the term "peak" to describe the results of HPLC analysis. Generally, Bands I,<br>
II, IE and IV of one system correspond to Peaks 1+2, (Band I), 3, 4, and 5 of the other<br>
system.)<br>
[012] Review of the literature shows that the low molecular weight species in Peak 4<br>
and Peak 5 are responsible for increased sweat inhibition and that enhanced efficacy<br>
results when there is a preponderance of these peaks. These reports indicate there are at<br>
least two distinct groups of materials in which there is a preponderance of Peaks 4 and 5.<br>
These two groups of materials are referred to herein as Group 1 Materials and Group 2<br>
Materials; both of which exhibit the attribute of enhanced efficacy. These two groups are<br>
differentiated with respect to their stability in water. As elaborated below, Group 1<br>
Materials are unstable in water and decompose rapidly to high molecular weight low<br>
efficacy materials. Group 2 Materials are stable in water; this characteristic provides<br>
certain commercial benefits as explained below.<br>
 <br>
[013] Group 1 Materials are characterized by their Peak 4 content in comparison to their<br>
Peak 3 content. A Peak 4 to Peak 3 area ratio of 0.5 or greater provides for increased<br>
sweat inhibition. These materials typically contain a preponderance of Peak 4 and a low<br>
level of Peak 3 and Peak 5. For example, 83% basic aluminum chlorohydrate (produced<br>
by the reaction of hydrochloric acid with aluminum metal) primarily contains high<br>
molecular weight species of Peaks 1 through 3. However ACH is converted to a Group 1<br>
Material by heating a dilute solution (e.g. about a 10% salt concentration by weight) at<br>
about 80-100° C for about 4 to 20 hours. (See US Patent 4,359,456 (Gosling), US Patent<br>
4,775,528 (Callaghan), US Patent 5,955,064 (Giovanniello), US Patent 6,149,897<br>
(Swaile) and references contained therein).<br>
[014] Table 1, Example 1 shows the composition of ACH with about 83% basicity<br>
prepared by the reaction of hydrochloric acid with aluminum metal. This material<br>
contains about 74% of high molecular weight species (Peaks 1 through 3) and about 26%<br>
low molecular weight species (Peak 4 and 5) and a Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio of about 0.1.<br>
The HPLC of this material is shown in Figure 1A. (For the sake of comparison, Figure 2<br>
is the HPLC taken from the literature of a non-enhanced aluminum antiperspirant salt of<br>
similar composition.)<br>
[015] Table 1 Example 2 shows the composition of the same material after heating a<br>
dilute (8% salt solution) at 100° C for two hours. As expected, high molecular weight<br>
Peaks 1 through Peak 3 materials are diminished and low molecular weight Peak 4<br>
materials are enhanced. In this example, the solution contains about 74% of the low<br>
molecular weight species in Peak 4, about 83% of Peak 4 &amp; 5 and a Peak 4 to Peak 3<br>
ratio of greater than 4.0. The HPLC of this material is shown in Figure 1B. (For the sake<br>
of comparison, Figure 3 is the HPLC taken from the literature of an aluminum-zirconium<br>
antiperspirant salt with Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio of greater than about 1.3.)<br>
 <br>
[016] In summary, Group 1 Materials are prepared through a multi-step process that<br>
requires manufacturing high basicity PAC from aluminum metal. Many of the references<br>
cited herein teach the use of aluminum powder which is more expensive than other<br>
sources of aluminum metal. The high basicity PAC prepared in the first step is then<br>
enhanced by diluting it to a 10% salt or less concentration and heating it for several hours<br>
at about 100° C. If an enhanced aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salt is being<br>
prepared the zirconium component is added either before or after the heat treating<br>
process. The dilute solution of enhanced efficacy antiperspirant salt is then rapidly spray<br>
dried in order to obtain the enhanced efficacy antiperspirant salt. Said antiperspirant salt<br>
is then formulated into consumer products.<br>
[017] One undesirable attribute of Group 1 Materials is their lack of stability in aqueous<br>
solution. These materials must be rapidly dried in order to preserve the increased low<br>
molecular weight, Peak 4 content. In the absence of rapid drying, the materials rapidly<br>
revert back to their high molecular weight counterparts. Upon drying, Group 1 Materials<br>
are formulated into costly non-aqueous compositions which require expensive carriers<br>
(e.g. cyclomethicone) in order to maintain the characteristic of increased sweat inhibition.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
[018] Group 2 Materials provide increased sweat inhibition and have the added benefit<br>
of being stable in aqueous solution for extended periods. (See US Patent 6,902,724<br>
(Parekh), US patent 6,649,152 (Carrillo) and US Patent 6,991,780 (Carrillo) and<br>
references contained therein.) The stability attribute provides for cost savings in<br>
manufacturing antiperspirants by eliminating the need for rapid drying, and or permitting<br>
the substitution of water for expensive carriers.<br>
[019] The procedure for manufacturing Group 2 Materials requires preparation of high<br>
basicity PAC from aluminum metal. Again expensive aluminum powder is<br>
recommended for this purpose. High basicity PAC is then enhanced by heating a dilute<br>
solution to about 100°C for several hours. Zirconium components are added either prior<br>
to or after the heating process. US Patent 6,649,152 teaches that the aluminum-zirconium<br>
salt with high Peak 5 content is preferably spray dried in order to obtain a salt with<br>
maximum efficacy. Thus, the procedures for manufacturing Group 2 Materials offer little<br>
improvement over the processes for manufacturing Group 1 Materials.<br>
[020] Group 2 Materials are stable over time due to their high Peak 5 composition.<br>
Table 1 Example 3 shows the composition of a Group 2 material composed of aluminum<br>
and zirconium. The amount of Peak 5 material required to impart stability in aqueous<br>
solution is dependent on several factors. In the case of aluminum antiperspirant salts, US<br>
Patent 6,902,724 teaches that this stability is imparted when Peak 5 ranges from 15% to<br>
50% and the Peak 4 plus Peak 5 composition is at least 45% and no more than 70%. The<br>
report further teaches that the Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio is unimportant. Although low<br>
molecular weight Peak 4 and Peak 5 components are known to provide increased sweat<br>
inhibition by blocking pores more effectively than their high molecular weight<br>
counterparts, this report teaches away from compositions containing more than 50% Peak<br>
5 and more than 70% Peak 4 plus Peak 5. No examples or explanation is offered with<br>
regard to this omission in the teachings.<br>
 <br>
[021] In the case of aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts, US Patent 6,649,152<br>
teaches that stability is imparted when the Peak 5 composition is at least 45%, the Peak 4<br>
to Peak 3 content is typically 20% to about 50%, the Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio is at least 0.4<br>
and substantially all of the aluminum is found in Peaks 3, 4 and 5. (This set of criteria can<br>
be shown to be mathematically equivalent to the criteria shown in Table 2 for Group 2<br>
Materials comprised of aluminum and zirconium.) An aluminum-zirconium<br>
antiperspirant salt meeting the requirements of Group 2 Materials is shown in4 Example 3<br>
of Table 1. In this example the material contains 72% Peak 5, an estimated Peak 4 plus<br>
Peak 5 content of 87% and a Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio of 1.1. The HPLC of this Group 2<br>
Material is shown in Figure 4. Thus, US Patent 6,649,152 and a related US Patent<br>
6,991,780 which are directed toward Group 2 Material comprised of aluminum-<br>
zirconium combinations, teach the benefit of high Peak 5 content with a Peak 4 to Peak 3<br>
ratio of at least 0.4, however their teachings do not address Group 2 Materials of<br>
aluminum and zirconium exclusively composed of Peak 5.<br>
[022] Criteria for defining Group 1 Materials and Group 2 Materials based on generally<br>
recognized definitions by skilled artisans are summarized below in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
[023] In summary, the efficacy of aluminum and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirants is<br>
determined by the amount of low molecular weight Peak 4 and Peak 5 components<br>
present Superior efficacy is obtained when the high molecular weight materials in Peaks<br>
1, 2 and 3 are minimized. When this goal is accomplished by maximizing Peak 4,<br>
enhanced efficacy is obtained but the material is unstable in aqueous solution. When this<br>
goal is accomplished by maximizing Peak 5, enhanced efficacy and stability in aqueous<br>
solution is obtained.<br>
 <br>
[024] A need therefore exists that overcomes one or more of the above identified issues.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[044] The present invention embraces processes for increasing the basicity of aluminum<br>
and aluminum-zirconium compounds.<br>
[045] Surprisingly these processes produce low molecular weight species which are<br>
known to provide enhanced efficacy characteristics in antiperspirant applications. The<br>
present processes are unique when compared to existing commercial processes for<br>
making said products insofar as they do not require aluminum metal as a raw material.<br>
Eliminating aluminum metal as a raw material for producing aluminum antiperspirant<br>
salts and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirants salts provides a solution to a long felt<br>
unmet need. The processes can produce products of a wide range of basicities and are<br>
particularly useful in producing high basicity products. The processes of the present<br>
invention produce a wide range of solution concentrations. The processes of the present<br>
invention produce high purity products. The processes described herein can also be<br>
utilized to produce enhanced efficacy aluminum and enhanced efficacy aluminum-<br>
zirconium compounds in high concentration. The processes of the present invention<br>
produce enhanced efficacy aluminum antiperspirant salts and enhanced efficacy<br>
aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts in a more straight forward manner than the<br>
process currently utilized by industry.<br>
 <br>
[052] The present invention surprisingly provides processes that increase the hydroxide<br>
content (i.e., the basicity) of compounds having the Formula I, wherein M is a metal (or<br>
combination of metals) that undergoes the reaction below. Examples of such metals<br>
include but are not limited to aluminum, zirconium, titanium and iron.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[054] The increase in hydroxide content (i.e., basicity) is accomplished by subjecting an<br>
aqueous solution of Compound I to electrodialysis, such that the HX concentration in the<br>
solution is decreased. Therefore, HX is effectively removed from the solution and from<br>
Compound I, thereby providing Compound I with increased hydroxide content relative to<br>
Compound I prior to electrodialysis treatment.<br>
[055] Alternatively, or in combination with the electrodialysis treatment of Compound<br>
I, Compound II can be subjected to conditions that cause Compound II to undergo a<br>
transformation to form Compound I with generation of HX. Again, during the<br>
electrodialysis treatment, HX is removed from solution, thereby providing Compound I<br>
with an increased hydroxide (increased basicity) content.<br>
[056] In particular, M can be aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), or iron (Fe).<br>
X can be nitrate or a halide such as chloride, bromide, oi iodide.<br>
[057] When M is aluminum, the aforementioned processes produce products with<br>
basicities ranging from ~1% to ~85%. Because, higher basicity products generally have<br>
greater utility, the processes preferably produce products of basicity greater than 50%,<br>
more preferably the processes produce products of basicity greater than 60%, and most<br>
preferably the process produces products of basicity greater than 65%. One particular<br>
interest is the use of these processes to produce aluminum chlorohydrate with a basicity<br>
of about 83% (in this case, X is Cl in the above formula and the aluminum to chloride<br>
ratio is from about 1.91:1 to about 2.10:1 with corresponding basicities of 82.5% to<br>
84.2%).<br>
[058] In another embodiment, a mixture of Compounds I and/or II with different metals<br>
(M), are subjected to the electrodialysis. For example, when aluminum and zirconium<br>
compounds of formula I and/or II are subjected to the electrodialysis treatment,<br>
aluminum-zirconium complexes with increased basicity are produced. Although the<br>
present invention can be used to produce aluminum and aluminum-zirconium compounds<br>
with a wide range of basicities, of particular relevance is the ability to produce<br>
antiperspirant salt compositions as defined by the Official Monographs of the United<br>
States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.). Thus, a preferred aluminum antiperspirant salt<br>
compositions salt taught by the present invention is ACH, a basic aluminum chloride with<br>
 <br>
aluminum to chloride ratio between about 1.9:1 to about 2.1:1 or aluminum<br>
sesquichlorohydrate, a basic aluminum chloride with aluminum to chloride ratio of about<br>
1.26 to about 1.90. A preferred aluminum zirconium antiperspirant salt compositions salt<br>
taught by the present invention is an aluminum zirconium chlorohydrate, more preferably<br>
an aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate (Al:Zr= about 2 to about 6; M:C1= about 0.9<br>
to about 1.5) or aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrate (Al:Zr= about 6 to about 10;<br>
M:C1= about 0.9 to about 1.5) or aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrate (Al:Zr= about<br>
6 to about 10; M:C1= about 2.1 to about 1.5) or aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrate<br>
(Al:Zr= about 2.0 to about 5.99; M:C1= about 2.1 to about 1.5). M:C1 is defined by the<br>
U.S.P. as the total metal (Al+Zr) to chloride ratio.<br>
[059] Preferred aluminum salts for use as starting materials are those having the<br>
empirical formula Al2(OH)nX6-n wherein X is Cl, Br, I, or NO3, preferably Cl; and n is<br>
about 0 to 5. The processes of the present invention are applicable to materials wherein n<br>
ranges from about 0 to about 5, however materials defined by n ranging from 0 to 3 are of<br>
particular interest due to their availability from economical routes. The aluminum salts<br>
also generally have some water of hydration associated with them<br>
[060] Preferred zirconium salts for use as starting materials are those having the general<br>
formula Zr(OH)4-bXb wherein X is Cl, Br, I, or NO3, preferably Cl; and b is about 0.7 to<br>
about 4.0. Although written for convenience as Zr(OH)4-bXb this salt is intended to<br>
include zirconium oxychloride and zirconium hydroxychloride, which is also often<br>
written as ZrO(OH)2-bClb (where b in this instance, is about 1 to about 2). The term<br>
zirconium hydroxyl-chloride is used herein to refer to compounds of the formula<br>
Zr(OH)4-bClb where b= about 0.7 to about 4.0 throughout this text. The zirconium salts<br>
also generally have some water of hydration associated with them, typically about 1 to<br>
about 8 moles per mole of salt. As an alternative to or in conjunction with the above<br>
described aluminum and zirconium salts, it is also possible to employ zirconium basic<br>
carbonate (Zr2(OH)4(CO)3nH2O) as a starting material.<br>
[061] Zirconium salts with a low Zr:X ratio are useful because such salts tend to have a<br>
lower molecular weight than other zirconium salts. It is theorized that the use of low<br>
molecular weight zirconium salts results in higher antiperspirant efficacy in the final<br>
aluminum-zirconium salt. Because the processes of the present invention are designed<br>
 <br>
for increasing basicity by extracting acids of the formula HX, said processes are well<br>
suited for accomplishing this goal. And because the processes of the present invention<br>
can be operated under mild conditions, in particular at low temperature when compared<br>
to other processes, formation of undesirable high molecular weight zirconium species is<br>
minimized.<br>
[062] Addition of an amino acid can help to stabilize aluminum and aluminum-<br>
zirconium complexes. The amino acid may be added either before, during or after the<br>
electrodialysis process. Therefore, one family of aluminum and aluminum-zirconium<br>
compounds advantageously produced by the present invention is defined by the formulas:<br>
 <br>
[064] where m is between about 2.0 and about 10.0, in particular between about 3.0 and<br>
about 8.0;<br>
[065] where n is between about 0.48 and about 1.11, which corresponds to a metal<br>
(Al+Zr) to anion (e.g., Cl-) ratio of M:X equal to between about 2.1 and about 0.9; q is<br>
between about 0 and about 4.0, and AA is an amino acid such as glycine, alanine, valine,<br>
serine, leucine, or aminobutyric acid. Suitable other amino acids and salts of other amino<br>
acids that may be used in the present invention will be evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
In addition to amino acids per se, such as glycine, amino acid compounds that are useful<br>
herein include alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of amino acids as well as<br>
ammonium salts of amino acids. The alkali metal salts and alkali earth metal salts may<br>
be introduced into the antiperspirant salt composition in their final form or they maybe<br>
generated in situ. The amino acid and amino acid salts may be incorporated into the<br>
antiperspirant salt composition prior to, during or after the electrodialysis process.<br>
[066] The aluminum and aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts of the present<br>
invention can be combined with organic solvents such as polyhydric alcohols in order to<br>
improve their solubility in certain formulations (e.g., clear stick gels) without sacrificing<br>
antiperspirant efficacy. The polyhydric alcohol will typically have from three to six<br>
carbon atoms and from two to six hydroxyl groups. Polyhydric alcohols commonly<br>
employed include but are not limited to propylene glycol, glycerin and polyethylene<br>
glycol. Alternatively, organic solvents having at least two carbon atoms and at least one<br>
 <br>
hydroxyl group may be used; said organic solvents include but are not limited to ethanol,<br>
propanol, iso-propanol, and butanol. The organic solvents may also be combined with<br>
aluminum antiperspirant salt compositions and aluminum zirconium antiperspirant salt<br>
compositions that contain amino acids. The addition of organic solvents may be prior to,<br>
during or after the electrodialysis process.<br>
[067] Calcium ions are known to stabilize polyaluminum chloride compositions. Said<br>
calcium ions may be introduced to the antiperspirant salt compositions of the present<br>
invention by adding a variety of calcium salts. The calcium salts include calcium<br>
hydroxide, calcium carbonate and calcium chloride and they may be added in quantities<br>
from 0 to 2%. The addition of calcium salts may be prior to, during or after the<br>
electrodialysis process.<br>
[068] The products of the present invention may be used or stored as an aqueous<br>
solution or they may be spray dried or vacuum dried to obtain the antiperspirant salt<br>
compositions in solid powder form.<br>
[069] The present invention surprisingly provides the ability to prepare enhanced<br>
efficacy aluminum and aluminum-zirconium compounds in essentially a single step.<br>
Heretofore, enhanced efficacy aluminum and aluminum-zirconium compounds were<br>
prepared through multi-step processes that were dependent on the conventional oxidation<br>
of aluminum metal with hydrochloric acid.<br>
[070] Electrodialysis is an electrochemical process in which ions are transported<br>
through ion permeable membranes from one solution to another under the influence of a<br>
potential gradient. The electrical charges on the ions allow them to be driven through the<br>
membranes fabricated from ion exchange polymers. Applying a voltage between two<br>
end electrodes generates the potential field required for ion transport across membranes<br>
to occur. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis have the ability to selectively<br>
transport ions having positive or negative charge and reject ions of the opposite charge,<br>
useful concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes can be achieved by<br>
electrodialysis.<br>
[071] Commercial applications of electrodialysis include:<br>
•	The removal of salt from brackish water to generate drinking water.<br>
 <br>
•	The concentration of salt from seawater up to 20% salt content, as a first<br>
step toward salt manufacture.<br>
•	The reduction of minerals from whey to manufacture infant formula.<br>
•	And the reduction of the salt content in soy sauce.<br>
[072] The device used for electrodialysis processes is generally referred to as an<br>
electrodialysis stack. The essential elements of an electrodialysis stack are an anode, a<br>
cathode, cation permeable membranes and anion permeable membranes. Figure 5 is a<br>
depiction illustrating the basic components and operation of an electrodialysis process.<br>
Thus, the cation and anion permeable membranes are placed between the anode and the<br>
cathode in alternating fashion. Assembling the ion permeable membranes in this fashion<br>
creates two distinct sets of compartments. The first set of compartments or cells is<br>
comprised of an anion permeable membrane on the anode side and a cation ion<br>
permeable membrane on the cathode side. This set of cells is oriented with respect to the<br>
anode and the cathode so that electrolytes are depleted from these cells when a voltage is<br>
applied. The solutions in this set of compartments are referred to as the depleting stream.<br>
The second set of compartments or cells is comprised of an anion permeable membrane<br>
on the cathode side and a cation permeable membrane on the anode side. This set of cells<br>
is oriented with respect to the anode and the cathode so that electrolytes are received and<br>
concentrated in these cells when a voltage is applied to the electrodes. The solutions in<br>
this second set of compartments are referred to as the receiving or the enriching stream.<br>
Thus, the net effect of the electrodialysis process is to transfer electrolytes from the<br>
depleting solution to the receiving solution where said electrolytes are concentrated.<br>
[073] Successful application of electrodialysis requires that the process under<br>
consideration has the ability to support a high rate of ion transfer across the ion<br>
permeable membrane surfaces for extended periods. The rate of ion transfer across<br>
membrane surfaces is referred to as the ionic flux and is measured in mole/sec-cm2. The<br>
ionic flux is related to the electrical charge passed through the electrodialysis cell by the<br>
following relationship:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[075J Since coulombs/sec is equivalent to amperes, the current density (CD.) is<br>
commonly measured in mamp/cm2. Successful electrodialysis processes (utilizing<br>
hydrocarbon membranes configured as described above) generally support a CD. from<br>
~10 to ~50 mamp/cm2. Current densities below ~10 mamp/cm2 are generally impractical<br>
due to the large amount of ion permeable membrane required and current densities above<br>
~50 mamp/cm2 are generally impractical due to physical limitations of the ion permeable<br>
membranes.<br>
[076] Electrodialysis processes are commonly performed at ambient temperatures; the<br>
commercial processes mentioned above are all performed at ambient temperatures. It<br>
was surprisingly found that current densities for the processes of the present invention are<br>
markedly improved by operating at increased temperature. Figure 6 compares the current<br>
density at 50°C, 55°C and 60°C as a function of basicity for the electrodialysis processes<br>
of the present invention. The information depicted in this diagram shows that current<br>
density is reduced as the basicity is increased but that the reduction in current density is<br>
mitigated by increasing temperature. This reduction in current density at increased<br>
basicity was confirmed by operating the electrodialysis processes of the present invention<br>
at various temperatures. Operation at 55°C to 65°C permitted current densities of 50 to<br>
40 mamp/cm2 to be realized over the range of basicities from about 40% to about 70%; in<br>
contradistinction operation at ambient temperature resulted in current densities of 42 to<br>
18 mamp/cm2 over the same range of basicities. At 55°C the current density at 83%<br>
basicity was 30 mamp/cm2; while operation at ambient temperature resulted in a current<br>
density of 2-4 mamp/cm2 at 83% basicity. Without being bound by theory, these<br>
observations suggest that polyaluminum chlorides participate in a process that causes<br>
membrane fouling as the basicity increases and that this fouling process is mitigated as<br>
the temperature is increased.<br>
[077] The observations cited above demonstrate that the current density for the<br>
electrodialysis processes of the present invention increases as the temperature of<br>
operation increases. The temperature of operation for electrodialysis is limited by<br>
various characteristics related to the materials of construction of the electrodialysis stack.<br>
Although, ion permeable hydrocarbon membranes rated to 80° C of operation are<br>
available, operation above 40° C is uncommon. Stack distortion, spacer manufacturing<br>
 <br>
technology and spacer integrity are the primary factors limiting higher temperature<br>
operation. Stack components that permit the present invention to operate at temperatures<br>
up to 65° C were utilized in the present work. Operation at temperatures higher than 65°<br>
C, while not practical with components currently available would be beneficial to the<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
[078] Membrane fouling, the deposition of materials (e.g., solids and or gels) that<br>
inhibit ion permeable membrane performance, leads to membrane degradation and must<br>
be minimized in order to maintain high current densities for extended periods.<br>
Macromolecules with ionizable functionalities promote membrane fouling since their<br>
charge causes them to migrate to the ion permeable membrane surface but their size<br>
prevents passage through said membrane. Polyaluminum chloride solutions form<br>
macromolecules and this attribute adversely influences the performance of<br>
electrodialysis. The propensity of PAC solutions to form macromolecules increases as<br>
the basicity increases and or as the concentration of the PAC solution increases. At<br>
basicities of greater than about 50% and or concentrations above about 1 molar<br>
(measured on an aluminum basis) membrane fouling adversely impacts the processes of<br>
the present invention. It was surprisingly found that fouling can be minimized by either<br>
using freshly prepared starting materials and or heat treating the reaction solutions prior<br>
to or during the electrodialysis process. It was surprisingly discovered, mat feed stocks<br>
for the electrodialysis processes of the present invention perform best if they are less than<br>
30 days old, preferably less than 20 days old, and most preferably used within 10 days<br>
from the time they are manufactured. The heat treating process of the present invention<br>
is conveniently performed by heating the feed solutions to a temperature of 70°C to<br>
boiling for a period of 15 min to 24 hours. The heat treating procedure of the present<br>
invention is carried out expediently by heating the feed solutions to a temperature of<br>
90°C for a period of one hour.<br>
[079] Successful application of electrodialysis also requires that the ion permeable<br>
membranes have a high degree of selectivity with respect to ion transport. Current<br>
efficiency is a measure of the selectivity of ion transport. The current efficiency is the<br>
ratio of current used by the desired process (removal of H+ and mono-valent anion (e.g.,<br>
Cl-) in the present invention) to the total current consumed by ion transport. Low current<br>
 <br>
efficiencies indicate the presence of nonselective ion transport. High current efficiencies<br>
are important to the economics of electrodialysis since the current efficiency impacts the<br>
size of the electrodialysis cell, the electrical power consumed and product purity.<br>
[080] While back migration of anions across cation permeable membranes is<br>
uncommon, back migration of H+ across anion permeable membranes is common in<br>
acidic media. The processes of the present invention operate under acidic conditions<br>
(pH
to maintain high current efficiency. In addition, the processes of the present invention<br>
require that H+ (present in concentrations of ~10-1 molar to ~10-3 molar) in the depleting<br>
solution be transferred across the cation permeable membranes in preference to metal<br>
cations h'ke Al+3 and Zr+4 (present in concentrations of greater than about 1 molar when<br>
measured on an metal basis). Non-selective cation transport can lead to reduced current<br>
efficiency and contamination of the depleting and or the receiving solution.<br>
[081] It was surprisingly discovered that highly selective ion transport (i.e., minimum<br>
back migration of H+ across anion permeable membrane and minimum contamination of<br>
the depleting solution) and high current efficiencies (greater than 85%-90%) result from<br>
appropriate selection of the receiving solution employed. When polyaluminum chloride<br>
with basicity greater than ~5%, preferably basicity greater than ~10% is used as the<br>
receiving solution, the hydrochloric acid removed from the depleting solution reacts with<br>
the PAC in the receiving solution. Thus, utilizing PAC as the receiving solution<br>
maintains the hydrochloric acid concentration in the receiving solution at low levels, back<br>
migration of hydrogen ion is markedly reduced and high current efficiencies are realized.<br>
[082] In comparison, when PAC is replaced by aluminum chloride as the receiving<br>
solution, the solution becomes rich in hydrochloric acid and the current efficiency drops<br>
to impractical levels (
receiving solution was also examined. The calcium chloride-hydroxide receiving solution<br>
gave current efficiencies of about 60% to 80%.<br>
[083] The overall process for the all aluminum system (i.e., when M=A1) is<br>
characterized by the reaction sequence below:<br>
Depleting Solution:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[084] wherein x varies from about 2 to about 6, y varies from about 1 to about 5, and<br>
whereby the HC1 present in the PAC solution of the depleting compartments is<br>
transferred across the ion permeable membranes to the receiving solution. The HC1 so<br>
transferred across ion permeable membranes reacts with the PAC present in the receiving<br>
solution. The overall process causes the PAC in the depleting solution to become more<br>
basic (due to the current driven removal of HCl) and the PAC in the receiving solution to<br>
become less basic. The PAC of the receiving solution is utilized in the manufacturing<br>
process as depicted in Figure 7 wherein said PAC is removed from the electrodialysis<br>
process and its basicity is increased by reaction with aluminum trihydrate (Al2O33H2O).<br>
Thus, the overall process is highly efficient with respect to raw materials because the<br>
hydrochloric acid removed from the depleting solution is used to manufacture more<br>
additional) PAC (see Figure 7).<br>
1085] The basicities of the PAC solutions in the reactions above and in Figure 7 are<br>
used for illustrative purposes and other combinations of practical basicities will be readily<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art. And although the depleting stream in the example<br>
above and in Figure 7 is represented as Al2(OH)6-xClx, the depleting stream can be any<br>
composition of Formula I or Formula II:<br>
 <br>
[093] Most electrodialysis processes are based on the use of monolayer membranes<br>
made from functionalized organic moieties like divinylbenzene and styrene. These<br>
 <br>
membranes are commonly referred to as hydrocarbon membranes in order to differentiate<br>
them from membranes made from functionalized polytetrafluoroethylenes (PTFE). The<br>
hydrocarbon membranes are inexpensive when compared to their PTFE counterparts and<br>
their use is preferred in mild applications (i.e., near neutral pH, ambient temperature, and<br>
the absence of redox processes). Hydrocarbon membranes are available as both anion<br>
permeable membranes and cation permeable membranes; while PTFE membranes are<br>
primarily available as cation permeable membranes. Interestingly, these two Types of<br>
membranes have distinctly different physical structures and modes of operation. While<br>
the hydrocarbon membranes are considered to function as continuous gels, the PTFE<br>
membranes are thought to be composed of a rigid hydrophobic backbone structure filled<br>
with hydrophilic channels where ion transport takes place. While physical evidence<br>
supports the idea that hydrocarbon and PTFE membranes operate through different<br>
mechanisms, both function to provide highly effective ion transport. The processes of the<br>
present invention can be practiced with either hydrocarbon membranes or PTFE<br>
membranes.<br>
[094] The processes of the present invention are operated in either a batch, semi-<br>
continuous mode (commonly referred to as the "shallow dump" process) or a continuous<br>
mode (commonly referred to as the "feed and bleed" process). Shallow dump refers to a<br>
mode of operation whereby after the electrodialysis process is taken to completion, the<br>
depleting and receiving solutions are partially drained from their respective recycle loops.<br>
The recycle loops are then replenished with fresh starting solutions and the electrodialysis<br>
process is repeated. Feed and bleed refers to a mode of operation whereby the<br>
electrodialysis process is maintained in a steady state; finished product is continuously<br>
bled from the recycle loop and replenished with starting material. All three modes of<br>
operation accommodate the opportunity to practice an operation known as CIP (cleaning<br>
in place) whereby the electrodialysis process is discontinued, receiving solutions and<br>
depleting solutions are removed from the electrodialysis stack and membranes are<br>
washed with a cleaning solution. Although any number of cleaning solutions may be<br>
utilized, the processes of the present invention are particularly responsive to acidic<br>
cleaning solutions; preferably hydrochloric acid cleaning solutions.<br>
 <br>
[095] As previously discussed, ACH is an important intermediate for the preparation of<br>
enhanced efficacy antiperspirant salts. ACH is produced commercially by the reaction of<br>
expensive aluminum powder with hydrochloric acid. Table 1 and Figure 1 demonstrate<br>
that ACH produced by this route is primarily high molecular weight Peak 1, Peak 2 and<br>
Peak 3 materials.<br>
[096] Low basicity PAC is known to be comprised of low molecular weight materials.<br>
Figure 8 shows the HPLC analysis of 40% PAC and demonstrates that this material is<br>
composed exclusively of Peak 4 materials (2%) and Peak 5 materials (98%); there is no<br>
Peak 1 through Peak 3 materials.<br>
[097] When 40% PAC is subjected to electrodialysis under the conditions taught by the<br>
present invention the basicity is increased. It was surprisingly discovered that as the<br>
electrodialysis process proceeds and the basicity increases that high proportions of Peak 4<br>
and Peak 5 components are retained even at high basicities commonly used in<br>
antiperspirant salt compositions. Table 3 shows the composition of samples taken from<br>
the electrodialysis process as the reaction proceeds. The electrodialysis process for the<br>
Table 3 examples was conducted at 65° C.<br>
[098] The results in Table 3 indicate that Peak 5 composition exceeds 50% and that the<br>
Peak 4 plus Peak 5 composition exceeds well over 70% up to 75% basicity. Example 8<br>
in Table 3 demonstrates the products of the present invention are stable over time,<br>
retaining a Peak 5 composition exceeding 50% and a Peak 4 plus Peak 5 composition<br>
exceeding 70%. The point is further confirmed by Figures 9A and 9B which show the<br>
HPLC analysis of freshly prepared 72% PAC prepared by the processes of the present<br>
invention (Figure 9A) and an HPLC analysis of the same sample analyzed two months<br>
later (Figure 9B). Thus, electrodialysis of low basicity PAC under the conditions of the<br>
present invention produces Group 2 Materials with unique composition up to ~75%<br>
basicity (see Examples 1-6). And, at basicities of greater than 75%, Group 2 Materials<br>
are produced (see Example 7). Table 3 also shows that the Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio<br>
exceeded 1.0 in all cases.<br>
[099] An additional benefit of the processes of the present invention is the relatively<br>
high concentration of products produced. The Al2O3 concentration of Example 5 in<br>
Table 3 is 15.5%. This Al2O3 concentration corresponds to U.S.P. antiperspirant salt<br>
 <br>
concentration of 40% aluminum sesquichlorohydrate. The U.S.P. method for calculating<br>
aluminum antiperspirant salt concentrations utilizes the following formula:<br>
[0100] %Antiperspirant Salt Concentration =<br>
[0101] Al({26.98x + [17.01(3x-l)]+35.453}/26.98x)<br>
[0102] where Al = concentration of aluminum and x = Al/Cl atomic ratio.<br>
 <br>
[0103] In another example 40% PAC was subjected to the electrodialysis process of the<br>
present invention. On this occasion the electrodialysis process was conducted at 60° C.<br>
The process was continued until the basicity reached 72%. Analysis by HPLC<br>
demonstrated that the product was a Group 2 Material composed of 4.5% Peak 3<br>
materials, 48% Peak 4 materials and 47.5% Peak 5 materials. The Peak 4 plus Peak 5<br>
composition was 95.5%; indicating once again a low molecular weight composition was<br>
produced. The Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio was 10.7. The Al2O3 concentration of the product<br>
was 13.6 corresponding to a U.S.P. antiperspirant salt concentration of 35% of aluminum<br>
sesquichlorohydrate.<br>
[0104] There are at least four approaches for the production of aluminum-zirconium<br>
antiperspirant salts using the electrodialysis processes of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
[0105] In the first instance, zircormrm-hydroxychloride and glycine is combined with<br>
high basicity PAC that is prepared by electrodialysis under conditions taught by the<br>
present invention. For example, a Group 2 aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate with<br>
an aluminum to zirconium ratio of 4 to 1 and metal to chloride ratio of 0.90 to 0.96 is<br>
produced when PAC with basicity of 70.4% to 73.3% (produced by the electrodialysis<br>
process of the present invention) is combined with zirconium oxychloridel[ZrOCl2) and<br>
glycine. And a Group 2 aluminum-zirconium octachlorohydrate with an aluminum to<br>
zirconium ratio of 8 to 1 and metal to chloride ratio of 0.90 to 0.96 is produced when<br>
PAC with basicity of 66.7% to 69.3% (produced by the electrodialysis process of the<br>
present invention) is combined with zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl2) and glycine. Other<br>
useful compositions will be apparent to those experienced in the art.<br>
[0106] In the second instance, zirconium hydroxyl-chloride is combined with high<br>
basicity PAC that is prepared by electrodialysis under conditions taught by the present<br>
invention in the presence of glycine. Table 4 shows samples prepared by adding<br>
zirconium oxychloride to high basicity PAC prepared by electrodialysis of 40% PAC in<br>
the presence of glycine. Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate is formed in these<br>
examples. The Peak 5 composition is greater than 45% and the Peak 4 plus Peak 5<br>
composition is greater than 60% in both examples, indicating that this approach is useful<br>
for making Group 2 Materials.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0107] In the third instance, PAC is combined with zirconium tetrachloride and or<br>
zirconium-hydroxychloride and or zirconium carbonates and used as a feedstock for the<br>
electrodialysis of the present invention. Glycine is optionally added upon the completion<br>
of the electrodialysis process.<br>
Table 5 shows the results of the electrodialysis of 40% PAC with zirconium oxychloride.<br>
In this case the Peak 5 composition remains well above 45% through the entire range of<br>
basicities. The Peak 4 plus Peak 5 composition also remains well above 60% through the<br>
entire range of basicities. Thus, the electrodialysis of PAC with zirconium-<br>
hydroxychloride yields Group 2 aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts.<br>
 <br>
[0108] Glycine is widely used in aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts. Table 6<br>
shows the result of combining glycine with the last two samples in Table 5. Again Group<br>
2 aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salts are produced.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
[0109] In the fourth instance, PAC is combined with zirconium tetrachloride and<br>
or zirconium-hydroxychloride and or zirconium carbonate and glycine. Said<br>
aluminum-zirconium glycine combination is then used as a feedstock for the<br>
electrodialysis processes of the present invention. In this instance unique<br>
compositions are obtained. When 40% PAC is combined with zirconium<br>
oxychloride and glycine and subjected to electrodialysis according to the<br>
teachings of the present invention, the product is composed exclusively of Peak 5<br>
material. Figure 10 shows the HPLC analysis as the electrodialysis process<br>
proceeds. During the entire process, only the presence of Peak 5 is detected<br>
(The two small peaks with longer retention time in this figure are glycine and<br>
hydrochloric acid). The final product in this example was an U.S.P. aluminum<br>
zirconium tetrachlorohydrate with the following formula Al3.4Zr(OH)9.5Cl4.7Gly<br>
(wherein Al:Zr = 3.4, and M:C1 = .94).<br>
[0110] Thus, it has been found that the disadvantages associated with the known<br>
methods to produce antiperspirant salts containing aluminum and the<br>
antiperspirant salts containing aluminum and zirconium are generally overcome<br>
by utilizing electrodialysis to increase the basicity of aluminum salts and or<br>
aluminum zirconium salt combinations. Although the processes of the present<br>
invention can be used to produce aluminum and aluminum-zirconium compounds<br>
with a wide range of basicities; and Al:Zr ratios, there is particular interest in the<br>
ability of the processes of the present invention to produce antiperspirant salt<br>
compositions as defined by the Official Monographs of the United States<br>
Pharmacopeia. Thus, a preferred aluminum antiperspirant salt compositions salt<br>
taught by the present invention is ACH, a basic aluminum chloride with<br>
aluminum to chloride ratio between about 1.91:1 to about 2.10:1 or aluminum<br>
sesquichlorohydrate, a basic aluminum chloride with aluminum to chloride ratio<br>

[0173] Description of HPLC Analysis: The methods for performing size<br>
exclusion HPLC analysis are well documented in the literature. The current work<br>
utilized procedures similar to those described the following references: US Patent<br>
6,649,152, US Patent 5,955,064, and US Patent 6,149,897. The specific<br>
instrumentation, column, and conditions used in the present work are described<br>
below:<br>
[0174] Instrument: Waters 510 HPLC Pump, Waters 717 Autosampler, Waters<br>
410 differential Refractometer, Millennium Version 3.20 Software.<br>
[0175] Column: Phenomenex Luna 5u Silica (2) 100A, 250 x 4.6 mm.<br>
[0176] Mobile Phase: HNO3 at pH 2.2, 0.5ml/minute.<br>
[0177] Instrument Parameters: Mobile Phase Flow at 0.5 mL/minute isocratic, RI<br>
detector temperature at 30°C, column temperature at 35°C, 10 uL injection.<br>
[0178] Sample Preparation: Samples are diluted 100 fold in mobile phase prior<br>
to injection.<br>
[0179] The electrodialysis experiments were carried out in a Eurodia EUR6-15<br>
electrodialysis stack. The stack consisted of a DSE anode and cathode and a<br>
combination of Neosepta AHA anion permeable membrane and Neosepta CMX<br>
cation permeable membranes. There were 15 ED membrane pairs each with an<br>
operating surface area of 0.056m2. The feed (PAC) compartment consisted of a<br>
14 liter glass reservoir and an Iwaki centrifugal circulating pump. Inlet pressure,<br>
flow, temperature, pH, and solution conductivity were monitored during the runs.<br>
[0180] The receiving loop consisted of a 14 liter glass reservoir and an Iwaki<br>
centrifugal circulating pump. The inlet pressure, pH and temperature of this<br>
solution were also monitored during the runs. The electrode rinse loop consisted<br>
of a 15 liter polypropylene reservoir and an Iwaki centrifugal circulating pump.<br>
The electrode rinse solution (0.5 % H2SO4) was split into two streams before<br>
entering the anode and cathode compartments. The solutions exiting the<br>
compartments were recombined in the main reservoir. It was anticipated that this<br>
configuration would maintain a constant pH in the rinse solution.<br>
 <br>
[0181] Power was supplied to the stack by two Sorensen DCS 20-50 DC power<br>
supplies connected in series. Selected data was collected during the runs (e.g.,<br>
current, depleting solution and receiving solution pH, depleting solution<br>
conductivity, depleting solution and receiving solution temperature and depleting<br>
solution flow and charge passed) and several samples of each stream weje taken<br>
for later analysis.<br>

[0183] Description of Electrodialysis Stack: The electrodialysis stack used in<br>
this example was a Eurodia 6. In this example there were twenty membrane<br>
pairs. The stack is designed to operate up to 65°C. The stack was configured<br>
with Astom membranes. The cation exchange membranes were CMX (cation<br>
exchange membrane) and the anion exchange membranes were AHA (anion<br>
exchange membrane). Both of these membranes are compatible with operation<br>
up to 65°C.<br>
[0184] 10 Liters of 40% PAC was diluted with 10 liters of deionized water. The<br>
solution was agitated and heated to 90°C. The solution was held at this<br>
temperature for 1 hour and then topped off with deionized water back to a total<br>
volume of 20 liters. After cooling to 60°C, the resulting solution was fed to the<br>
electrodialysis stack as the depleting solution as described below.<br>
[0185] The enriching solution was approximately 2 M CaCl2 solution (6 liters).<br>
The enriching solution compartments were equipped with an apparatus that<br>
allowed for the addition of Ca(OH)2 in order to maintain the pH at a value of 0.5<br>
or greater during the course of the run. The depleting solution was also heated to<br>
and maintained at a temperature of 60°C during the course of the run.<br>
[0186] Circulation of the enriching and depleting solutions was begun and a<br>
potential gradient of about 14 volts was applied to the cell (-0.4 volts per<br>
membrane pair); the current density was limited to 50 mA/cm . The current<br>
efficiency was 65%.<br>
 <br>
[0187] At the end of the run the depleting solution had a volume of 11.6 liters<br>
and was analyzed to contain 13.6% Al2O3. (or 3.3 Molar on an aluminum basis)<br>
with 71.7% basicity. The product produced was Al2(OH)4.3 Cl1.7. Analysis by<br>
HPLC demonstrated the product was composed of 4.5% Peak 3, 48% Peak 4 and<br>
47.5% Peak 5. The Peak 4 to Peak 3 ratio was 10.7<br>

[0195] Heat Treatment of the Depleting Solution: 5 Liters of 40% PAC (~17.1% .<br>
Al2O3) was diluted with 4.3 Liters of water; the agitated solution was heated to<br>
90°C. The solution was held at this temperature for 1 hour and allowed to cool to<br>
65°C before feeding the resulting solution to the electrodialysis stack as the<br>
depleting solution as described below.<br>
[0196] Heat Treatment of the Receiving Solution: 6.7 Liters of 40% PAC were<br>
heated to 90°C. The solution was held at this temperature for 1 hour and allowed<br>
to cool to 65°C before feeding the resulting solution to the electrodialysis stack as<br>
the receiving solution as described below.<br>
[0197] The depleting loop of the ED stack was charged with 9.3 Liters of the<br>
depleting solution prepared as described above. The receiving loop of the ED<br>
stack was charged with 6.7 Liters of the receiving solution prepared as described<br>
above. Circulation of the enriching and depleting solutions was begun and a<br>
potential gradient of ~16 volts was applied to the cell (0.8 volts per membrane<br>
pair). The initial current was 40 mA/cm2. The current density was maintained at<br>
40 mA/cm2 and the basicity was increased to 64%. The voltage had increased to<br>
17.99 volts at this point.<br>
 <br>
[0198] 7.44 Liters of the depleting solution prepared similarly to that described<br>
above was added to the depleting loop. 4 Liters of the receiving solution<br>
prepared similarly to that described above was added to the receiving loop and<br>
the current flow was maintained. The addition of fresh solutions caused the<br>
voltage to drop and the current density returned to the level of 40 mA/cm2. When<br>
the basicity of the depleting solution reached ~74%, the CD was 36 mA/cm2.<br>
The run was terminated at 78% basicity and the CD at this time was 34 mA/cm2.<br>
61.9 moles of charge were passed during the experiment and the current<br>
efficiency was 82%.<br>

[0201] Preparation of the depleting solution: Zirconium oxychloride<br>
(ZrOCl2 8H2O) 1.96 kg was dissolved in 3 L H2O. Glycine 0.474 kg was added<br>
and the solution was stirred for about 1 hour. The zirconium-glycine solution was<br>
then diluted to a volume of 5 liters. Freshly prepared 40% PAC 6.85 kg (17.1%<br>
AI2O3) was heated to and maintained at 90°C for a period of 1 hour. The hot<br>
PAC solution was slowly added with mixing to the room temperature zirconium-<br>
glycine solution, resulting in a combined solution with a temperature of about 60°<br>
C.<br>
[0202] The receiving solution in this experiment was comprised of 8.75 kg of<br>
40% PAC (~17.1% A12O3), which was also heat-treated at 90°C for a period of 1<br>
hour. The receiving solution was cooled to about 60°C and both the depleting<br>
and the receiving solutions were charged to the Eurodia 6.<br>
 <br>
[0203] Circulation of the enriching and depleting solutions was begun and a<br>
potential gradient of about 18 volts was applied to the cell (~0.8 volts per<br>
membrane pair); the current density was limited to 40 mA/cm2.<br>
[0204] The experiment was terminated after passage of 2251 Amp min. The<br>
analysis of the depleting solution is shown in the table below. The results"*<br>
demonstrate that the 40% PAC was converted to Al3.4Zr(OH)9.5Cl4.7 Gly having<br>
a metal to chloride ratio of 0.94 and a basicity of 64.5% (based on the OH to total<br>
metal valence ratio). The current efficiency was 88%.<br>
