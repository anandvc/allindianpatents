Winding machine<br>
The invention relates to a winding machine having a plurality of bobbin stations for winding a plurality of threads into bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
A generic winding machine is known, for example, from EP 0 845 550 Al.<br>
Winding machines of this type are used for winding freshly spun synthetic threads. The synthetic threads are previously extruded in a spinning device in parallel and next to one another from a polymer melt, in each case to form a multiplicity of filament strands, and are cooled and bundled. The threads are subsequently guided in parallel in a treatment device, preferably via godet systems, in order at the end to be wound in parallel in the winding machine into bobbins. The threads are led from me It-spinning up to winding at different distances from one another. Thus, first, in each case a spinning distance is maintained between the threads in the spinning device and is due essentially to the spinneret spacings of the spinneret assemblies. After cooling, the threads are converged, in order to be guided jointly at a substantially smaller treatment distance from one another through the treatment device. The treatment distance is maintained between the threads essentially up to and before entry into the winding machine. In the winding machine, a winding distance between the threads has to be maintained which is due essentially to the winding widths of the bobbins of the individual bobbin stations. The thread group is therefore spread apart from the treatment distance to the winding distance. In the transitional region between the spinning device and the treatment device and also between the treatment device and the winding machine,  thread guide means are provided,  therefore,<br><br>
which make it possible to deflect or deviate the individual threads. So as not to obtain any appreciable variations in the physical properties of the threads during such deflections and deviations, specific deviation angles must be maintained, particularly on the threads guided on the outside, in transitional regions. During the winding of the threads, a further problem is that any deviation involving friction on the thread leads to an increase in the thread pull and therefore influences the winding tension during the winding of the thread on the bobbin.<br>
In order to generate threads of equal quality and identical bobbins at each of the bobbin stations, EP 0 845 550 Al proposes a design of a winding machine of this type in which each of the threads is assigned a delivery unit for influencing the thread tension. In this case, the delivery units are formed by driven rollers, so that a specific thread tension can be set on each of the threads which in each case have an individual history dependent on the position. Systems of this type are used preferably in a spinning device without additional godet guides. In the event that the threads are previously guided in the treatment device via a godet system, the delivery units constitute an additional outlay in terms of apparatus.<br>
The object of the .invention, then, is to develop a winding machine of the generic type, in such a way that a thread group supplied by a treatment device and spread out can be supplied to the bobbin stations as far as possible without any appreciable thread tension differences.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide a winding machine which can be assigned to a treatment device without any appreciable distance.<br><br>
The object is achieved, acCording to the invention by means of a winding machine, in that the head thread guides of the bobbin stations, which effect a deflection of the in-running thread, are formed in each case by a freely rotatable guide roller, the roller axes of which are oriented essentially orthogonally to the winding spindle.<br>
The invention is not even suggested by the fact that it is basically known in the prior art to supply the in-running thread via a guide roller on a winding device having a bobbin station, as is known, for example, from DE 1 760 990. In this case, the guide roller is assigned to the bobbin station in such a way that the roller axis and the winding spindle are parallel to one another. Such an arrangement has the disadvantage, however, that the thread guided back and forth within a traversing stroke is likewise guided back and forth in a part region on the circumference of the guide roller. Additional measures must therefore be taken, so that the thread does not fall down from the circumference of the guide roller as is known, for example, from DE 42 25 690 Al.<br>
In the winding machine according to the invention, the traversing plane, on which the thread is guided back and forth, forms a radial plane of the guide roller, so that a reliable thread guidance on the guide roller is possible in each of the bobbin stations. The traversing movement of the thread leads merely to a variation in the looping angle on the guide roller guided freely rotatably.<br>
The winding machine according to the invention possesses the special advantage that, in each of the bobbin stations, the thread supplied is supplied, essentially free of friction, to the bobbin stations. In this case, the thread tension build-up caused by the<br><br>
bearing friction of the guide rollers is essentially identical at each of the bobbin stations.<br>
Advantageous developments of the winding machine according to the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the subclaims.<br>
In particular, that design of the winding machine is advantageous in which the guide rollers are arranged within the bobbin station in such a way that the deflection of the thread running into the middle of the traversing stroke results in a minimum looping on the circumference of the guide roller at an angle a &gt; arctan H/2A, H defining the length of the traversing stroke and A the distance between the guide roller and a traversing plane spanned by the traversing reversal points. Consequently it can be ensured that, even in the case of long traversing strokes, the thread acquires a sufficient thread guidance on the guide roller. The minimum looping on the circumference of the guide roller is in this case preferably selected such that essentially no decrease in rotational speed occurs on the conveying roller, so that the in-running thread is guided without any appreciable slip on the circumference of the guide roller.<br>
So that the degree of looping on the guide roller can be influenced, the guide roller is preferably arranged with its roller axis offset with respect to a mid-perpendicular of the bobbin station. Depending on the position of the bobbin station and the degree of deflection of the thread supplied, different arrangements of the guide rollers in relation to the respective mid-axes of the bobbin stations may be selected. Minimum loopings on the circumference of the guide roller thus can advantageously be implemented, with the threads deviated to only a little extent.<br><br>
Preferably,  the offset between the mid-perpendicular and the roller axis is selected so as to be equal to half the diameter of the guide roller, thus resulting, on the guide roller, in a thread run-off point which lies on the mid-perpendicular.<br>
The preferred design of the winding machine, in which the guide rollers have in each case a guide casing held on the roller axis by an air mounting, is distinguished in that the threads can be wound into bobbins with as low winding tensions as possible. The air mounting in the guide rollers leads to relatively low bearing friction which allows a very low thread tension buildup and therefore an almost slip-free thread guidance on the circumference of the guide roller.<br>
For the stability of the thread run in the bobbin stations, particularly that development of the winding machine is used in which the guide rollers have in each case on the circumference a groove-shaped guide track in which the in-running thread is guided. In this case, at least the region of the guide track on the circumference of the guide roller is protected by a wearing coating, so that premature wear phenomena on the circumference of the guide rollers are avoided.<br>
In the event of the thread group being supplied centrally to the winding machine by a guide means assigned to the treatment device, that design of the winding machine according to the invention is particularly advantageous in which an even number of bobbin stations is provided, and in which the guide means is held centrally with respect to the bobbin stations. Thus, the supply of the threads to the individual bobbin stations in each case requires a spreading and therefore a deflection of the thread in the bobbin stations, so that each of the bobbin stations is designed with a guide roller.<br><br>
So that as short a distance as possible can be maintained between the bobbin station and a treatment device, that development of the winding machine according to the invention is particularly advantageous in which an even number or an odd number of bobbin stations is provided, and in which a guide means, mounted above the guide rollers for guiding the thread group is held in the end regions of the bobbin stations.<br>
In order, in each of the bobbin stations, to obtain as constant a bobbin width as possible on the bobbins, the guide rollers of the bobbin stations are preferably arranged in a plane which extends parallel to the traversing plane.<br>
The winding machine according to the invention is explained in more detail below by means of some exemplary embodiments, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a side view of a first exemplary embodiment of a winding machine according to the invention,<br>
fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a front view of the exemplary embodiment from fig. 1,<br>
fig. 3 shows diagrammatically the thread entry in one of the bobbin stations of the exemplary embodiment from fig. 1,<br>
fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a guide roller,<br>
fig. 5 shows diagrammatically a side view of a further exemplary embodiment of the winding<br><br>
machine according to the invention.<br>
Figs 1 and 2 illustrate a first exemplary embodiment of the winding machine according to the invention in a plurality of views. Inasmuch as there is no express reference made to one of the figures, the following description applies to both figures.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of the winding machine according to the invention has, overall, four bobbin stations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 which are formed next to one another in the winding machine (fig. 1). In each of the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4, in each case a thread is supplied and is wound into a bobbin. The set-up of the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4 is designed identically, and therefore the basic set-up is described with reference to the bobbin station 1.1 located first on an operating side.<br>
The bobbin station 1. 1 has a traversing means 4, by which a thread 2.1 supplied is guided back and forth within a traversing stroke. The traversing means could be formed, for example, by reversible thread traversing, in which a traversing thread guide is guided back and forth within a traversing stroke, or by flyer traversing with a plurality of contra-directionally driven flyer tips which guide the thread back and forth so as to take it up. The traversing means 4 is preceded by a head thread guide 3 which forms the tip of what is known as a traversing triangle. The head thread guide 3 forms the entry into the bobbin station 1.1.<br>
To wind the thread 2.1 in the bobbin station 1.1, a winding tube 9 is tension-mounted on the circumference of a driven winding spindle 6.1. The winding spindle 6.1 extends in this case over all the adjacent bobbin stations 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, so that the threads 2.1 to<br><br>
2 . 4 supplied are wound simultaneously in each bobbin station 1.1 to 1.4.<br>
To deposit the thread 2.1 on the surface of the bobbin 8.1 in the bobbin station 1.1, a pressure roller 5 is arranged between the traversing means 4 and the winding spindle 6.1. The pressure roller 5 likewise extends over the entire length of the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4. The thread 2.1, after looping partially on the circumference of the pressure roller 5, is deposited on the surface of the bobbin 8.1.<br>
In the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4, the head thread guides are formed in each case by guide rollers 11.1 to 11.4 mounted freely rotatably. The guide rollers 11.1 to 11.4 are oriented in the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4 in each case with their roller axes orthogonal with respect to the winding spindle 6.1. In this case, the guide rollers 11.1 to 11.4 are held on a carrier 12 connected to a machine stand 10.<br>
The machine stand 10 serves for the reception and fastening of the traversing means 4, of the pressure roller 5 and of the winding spindle 6.1. In this exemplary embodiment, the pressure roller 5 is held pivot ably on the machine stand 10 via a rocker 13. The winding spindle 6.1 is mounted, overhanging, in a winding turret 7 which is held rotatably in the machine stand 10. The winding turret 7 holds, offset at 180° with respect to the winding spindle 6.1, a second winding spindle 6.2, so that a continuous winding of the threads in the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4 can be carried out. The winding turret 7 and the winding spindles 6.1 and 6.2 in each case are assigned drives (not illustrated here).<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, illustrated in figs 1 and 2, of the winding machine according to the invention, a<br><br>
thread group consisting of the four threads 2.1 to 2.4 is supplied to the winding machine via a guide means 14 . The guide means 14, which belongs to a treatment device (not illustrated here) is formed in this case by a godet unit with a driven godet 24 and with a run-over roller 25. At the godet unit, the threads 2.1 to 2.4 are guided at a small distance from one another at what is known as the treatment distance. The guide means 14 is arranged centrally with respect to the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4 in such a way that the spreading of the threads 2.1 to 2.4 takes place centrally with respect to the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4, so that the threads 2.1 and 2.4 loop clockwise around the assigned guide rollers^ 11.1 and 11.2 of the bobbin stations 1.1 and 1.2 and the threads 2.3 and 2.4 loop counterclockwise around the guide rollers 11.3 and 11.4 of the bobbin stations 1.3 and 1.4. The guide rollers 11.1 and 11.2 are thus driven clockwise and the guide rollers 11 . 3 and 11.4 counterclockwise by the looping friction of the threads. The guide rollers reach a circumferential speed which is essentially equal to the thread speed, so that the threads are supplied essentially slip-free, to the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4.<br>
By the following traversing means 4, the threads are shifted back and forth in each of the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4 and are wound on the winding spindle 6. 1 into a cross-wound bobbin.<br>
The arrangement of the guide roller in relation to the traversing means is illustrated diagrammatically below in figure 3 by the example of the bobbin station 1.1. The guide roller 11.1 is arranged at a distance A above the traversing means 4. The traversing means 4, which, for example, could be an osciliatingly driven traversing thread guide 26 or a plurality of contradirectionally  driven  flyer  tips  of  a  flyer<br><br>
traversing, guides the thread 2 . 1 running off from the guide roller 11 . 1 back and forth within a traversing stroke having the length H.<br>
The traversing reversal points 20.1 and 20.2 designate the thread reversal at the ends of the traversing stroke. The middle of the traversing stroke is identified by a mid-perpendicular 19 which essentially defines the middle of the bobbin station 1.1. In this exemplary embodiment, the guide roller 11.1 is arranged with its roller axis 15 offset with respect to the mid-perpendicular 19. The offset is identified in fig. 3 by the letter V. The offset V in this case is equal to half the diameter of the guide roller 11.1, so that the thread 2 .1 leaves the guide roller 11.1 on the mid-perpendicular 19.<br>
It can be gathered from the thread positions, illustrated by dashes, at the stroke ends, that the thread looping on the guide roller 11 . 1 varies. The thread 2.1 in this case moves essentially in a radial plane 11.1, the run to the traversing point 20.1 causing a maximum looping and the run to the traversing point 20.2 a minimum looping on the guide roller 11.1. In order, particularly during the run to the traversing reversal point 20.2, to prevent the thread from lifting from the circumference of the guide roller 11.1, a minimum looping angle in the deflection of the thread 2.1 on the circumference of the guide roller 11.1 is maintained. The minimum looping angle a, which occurs during the run-off of the thread 2.1 at the middle of the traversing stroke, must maintain a minimum value in relation to the length of the traversing stroke H and to the distance A between the guide roller 11.1 and the traversing means 4. In this case, a &gt; arctan H/2A applies.<br>
It  became  apparent  that  a  minimum  looping  of<br><br>
a = 10° + arctan H/2A was shown to be sufficient to ensure reliable guidance.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the winding machine according to the invention, illustrated in fig. 1, the distances between the guide rollers 11.1 to 11.4 and the traversing means 4 are kept identical, so that all the guide rollers 11.1 to 11.4 are located in a plane which extends parallel to the traversing plane defined by the traversing reversal points. Consequently, in the case of identical stroke lengths of the traversing strokes, identical bobbin widths are wound in individual bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4. To vary and set specific looping ratios, however, there is the possibility that, in each of the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.4, the offset V between a mid-perpendicular of the bobbin station and the roller axis of the guide roller is designed differently. Thus, for example, the offset of the guide roller 11.3 and 11.4 is designed to be mirror-offset with respect to the offset of the guide roller 11.1 and 11.2.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a guide roller, such as could be used, for example, in the bobbin stations of the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1, is illustrated diagrammatically in a cross-sectional view in fig. 4 .<br>
The guide roller is formed by a guide casing 16 and a roller shaft 15. The guide casing 16 is mounted on the roller shaft 15 via an air mounting 17. For this purpose, the roller shaft 15 has an air supply 18, by means of which compressed air is conducted into the bearing gap between the guide casing 16 and the roller shaft 15. The roller shaft 15 is fastened to a carrier 12.<br>
The guide casing 16 on the circumference has a groove-<br><br>
shaped guide track 21 which is delimited toward one end by a collar 22. The guide track 21 on the circumference of the guide casing 16 has a wearing coating 23. The thread is guided within the guide track 21.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment of a winding machine according to the invention with, overall, five bobbin stations is illustrated in fig. 5. In this case, the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.5 are designed identically to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1. The arrangement and fastening of the individual assemblies within the winding machine are likewise identical to the preceding exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1, and therefore reference may be made to the aboyementioned description, only the differences being explained at this juncture.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 5, the bobbin stations 1.1 to 1.5 are assigned a guide means 14 on the end face of the winding machine. The guide means 14 is in this case formed by a singly looped godet 24 at which the threads are guided. The distribution of the threads in this case takes place essentially out of a horizontal plane arranged only insignificantly above the plane of the guide rollers 11.1 to 11.5. A looping of approximately 90° is thus achieved on each of the guide rollers 11.1 to 11.5. An arrangement of this type has the special advantage that highly compact spinning devices consequently can be produced which require essentially only one tier arranged above for the spinning device. A spinning device of this type is known, for example, from WO 2004/015173 Al, and therefore reference will be made at this juncture to the abovementioned publication.<br>
The exemplary embodiments of the winding machine according to the invention illustrated in figs 1 and 5 are exemplary in^ terms of the set-up and arrangement of<br><br>
the bobbin stations.<br>
Basically, the traversing means of all the bobbin stations may be driven jointly. Moreover, a combination of different head thread guides is also possible, depending on the preceding supply means of the treatment device. Thus, for example, the head thread guides, on which the in-running threads are guided with only very low deflection, may be formed by conventional guide means such as, for example, a pigtail thread guide and adjacent head thread guides via a guide roller. It is in this case essential that identical properties and identical thread pulls have an effect on each of the threads supplied to the bobbin stations.<br><br>
