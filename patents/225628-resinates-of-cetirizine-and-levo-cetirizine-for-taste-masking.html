"Rapidly Disintegrating Taste Masked Compositions and a Process for<br>
its Preparations"<br>
Themis Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. having its registered office at Unit No. S - 4 , Khira Industrial Estate, B.M Bhargava Road, Santacruz West, Mumbai 400054, Maharashtra, India an Indian Company<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br>
Q QJlx ^Jt	*      M   rJ!H   jfT I<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to resinates of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutical^ acceptable 5 salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride, fast disintegrating and or quick release pharmaceutical compositions comprising the said resinates and process for the preparation of resinates and compositions.<br>
10     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Oral dosage forms containing Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride have bitter taste and therefore need to be taste masked. 15 Taste masking is generally done by various means such as formation of new salt, coating, inclusion complexes, resinates, etc to enable oral dispersion of compositions that are "fast melt" or "rapid melt" or "quick disintegrating", which are prepared using technologies such as Zydis, Orasolv, Flashdose.<br>
20 Issues related to resinate formation relate to choosing the appropriate resin as it is drug specific which in turn strongly influence the drug release profile, drug stability in the resinate and resinate dispersibility.<br>
US 2990332 discloses a method for loading active substances onto an ion exchange 25     resin, loading being dependant on the rate of diffusion, the equilibrium constant, temperature, and the presence of other ions.<br>
US 6565877 teach a taste masked composition which comprises a bitter tasting drug, a combination of two enteric polymers comprising, a methacrylic acid copolymer and a 30 phthalate polymer. The patent cautions on the use of cation-exchange resins such as polysulfonic acid and polycarboxylic acid polymers to adsorb amine drugs for taste masking as the drug release may be compromised.<br>
US 5071646 entitled "Pharmaceutical Ion-exchange Resin Composition", discloses<br>
35     resin compositions comprising a granulated ion-exchange resin, a pharmacologically<br>
active ingredient bound thereto with a sugar or sugar alcohol, and a sufficient amount of<br>
2<br><br>
water, alcohol or aqueous alcohol to facilitate granulation and the ratio of active agent to ion-exchange resin may vary between about 1:3 to 2:1 such that the compositions are dispersible in large quantity of water, twenty times the weight of composition when stirred. 5<br>
US 5188825 discloses freeze-dried dosage forms prepared by bonding or complexing a water-soluble active agent to or with an ion exchange resin to form a substantially water insoluble complex.<br>
10 US 5219563 teach use of synthetic cation exchange resins such as copolymers of styrene and divinylbenzene which are sulphonated and copolymers of methacrylic acid and divinylbenzene for masking the bitter taste of ranitidine.<br>
Sriwongjanya M, Bodmeier R. Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 1998 Nov; 46(3):321-7 teaches 15     that the drug release from HPMC matrix based tablets containing drug-resin complexes is significantly slower than from HPMC matrix based tablets containing drug without resin.<br>
The Publications "Fast-Dissolving Tablets" in US Pharmacist March 2002 and "Design of Fast Dissolving Tablets "IJPE - Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, Oct-Dec, 20     2001" indicate following drawbacks of technologies related to fast dissolving tablets using non-aqueous solvents:<br>
1) Tablets produced by Zydis technology are soft, fragile and therefore not suitable for<br>
conventional blister packing. These are hygroscopic and exhibit poor stability during<br>
test conditions. 25     2) Tablets produced by orasolv technology are soft and friable and hence packaged<br>
using an integrated packaging line that uses a specially designed robotic pick and<br>
pack system. 3) A specialized packaging is required to protect highly friable, soft and moisture<br>
sensitive tablets of Flashdose technology.<br>
30 It is a longstanding need of the industry to provide resinates of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride having taste masking properties and their compositions that are rapid disintegrating and or quick release, optionally containing other actives. Further it is desirable to prepare such compositions<br>
3<br><br>
without the use of nonaqueous solvents thereby obviating the use of sophisticated machinery as is done in prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
5 The main object of the invention is to provide resinates of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride, rapid disintegrating and or quick release taste masked pharmaceutical compositions comprising the said resinates and process for the preparation of resinates and compositions.<br>
10<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare stable resinates of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride, rapid disintegrating and or quick release taste  masked  pharmaceutical  compositions comprising  the said<br>
15     resinates and process for the preparation of resinates and compositions.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide easily dispersible resinates of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride, rapid 20 disintegrating and or quick release taste masked pharmaceutical compositions comprising the said resinates and process for the preparation of resinates and compositions.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a rapidly disintegrating taste masked 25 composition of Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride without the use of non-aqueous solvents thereby obviating the use of sophisticated machinery.<br>
30 Yet another object of the invention to provide taste masked rapidly disintegrating and or quick release composition of Cetirizine or its physiologically acceptable salt or its enantiomers or salts thereof or Levocetrizine Dihydrochloride with at least one more active ingredient.<br>
4<br><br>

The resinate was given to 6 volunteers for testing palatability. The resinate was judged to be substantially free from bitter taste otherwise associated with Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride. The compositions 5 comprising resinate were given to 6 volunteers for testing palatability, mouth-feel, and taste. It was also reported that the compositions were substantially free from the bitter taste, otherwise associated with Cetirizine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or its enantiomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of its enantiomers such as Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride. The disintegration time of the tablet in the oral cavity was 10     about 30 - 45 seconds.<br>
The invention is illustrated with non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1: Taste masked Levocetirizine resinate.<br>
50gms of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride was dissolved in 900ml water. The pH of this 15 solution was adjusted to about 6 using 2N sodium hydroxide solution in water. 100gm of Tulsion 335 was slurred and stirred for 4 hours. The suspension was filtered through an appropriate filter and the solid was re-suspended in about 1000 ml water. Suspension obtained was stirred for about 12 hours. Stirred suspension was filtered using appropriate filters. This process of filtration and resuspension was repeated for 3 times. 20 Finally the suspension was filtered through an appropriate filter and resinate was dried at 60°C in tray dryer. The dried resinate contained about 32%w/w of Levocetirizine compared to theoretical 33.33%w/w of Levocetrizine at the proportion taken in this experiment. Yield as high as 98%/ww was achieved. As per the evaluation by volunteers said resinate was substantially free from bitter taste associated with drug.<br><br>

The resulting mixture was compressed into tablets so as to contain 5mg of Levocetirizine base. Tablets had hardness of about 3 kps/cm2, friability 5 of 0.29% for 100 revolutions and were packed in Alu/Alu, Alu/PVC packing foils using conventional machines. The tablets rapidly disintegrate in mouth in not more than 60 seconds when tested in 10 volunteers and in USP disintegration test apparatus.<br>
Example 3: Taste masked resinate of Cetirizine dihydrochloride.<br>
10 50gm of Cetirizine dihydrochloride was dissolved in 900ml water. The pH of this solution was adjusted to about 5.98 using 2N sodium hydroxide solution in water. 100gm of Tulsion 335 was slurred and stirred for about 4 hours. The suspension was filtered through an appropriate filter and the solid was re-suspended in about 1000 ml water. Suspension obtained was stirred for about 12 hours. Stirred suspension was filtered<br>
15 using appropriate filters. This process of filtration and resuspension was repeated 3 times. Finally the suspension was filtered through an appropriate filter and resinate was dried at 60°C. Yield was about 98%. As per the evaluation by volunteers said resinate was substantially free from the bitter taste associated with drug.<br>

25 Resinate was mixed with diluent (Pearlitol SD200), disintegrants (crospovidone) lubricants (colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate), sweetener and flavor, after passing through suitable sieve. The resulting mixture was compressed into tablets so as to contain 10mg of Cetirizine base per tablet. By reducing the quantity of resinate proportionally we get tablets containing 5 mg of Cetirizine base per tablet. These tablets<br>
8<br><br>
have hardness of about 3 kps/cm2, friability of 0.37% for 100 revolutions and are packed in Alu/Alu Alu/PVC packing foils using conventional machines. The tablets rapidly disintegrate in mouth in not more than 60 seconds when tested in 10 volunteers and in USP disintegration test apparatus. 5<br>

Levocetrizine resinate 1.9 gms in 600 ml is equal to 5mg of Levocetrizine per 5ml. 5 Levocetrizine resinate, Sodium CMC, Sucrose and Propyl Paraben were mixed in mixer. Water was added to make volume to 600 ml. Similarly in another experiment 600 ml were prepared without sugar. The compositions were studied for 7 days. Subjective evaluation testing was done during and after 7 days. Not only the composition containing sugar was substantially free from bitter taste, but also the composition without sugar was 10 substantially free from bitter taste even after 7 days. The suspensions remain easily re-dispersible at the end of 7 days and were palatable.<br>
Example 10: Stability of Levocetirizine resinate at 80°C with respect to taste.<br>
Resinate when kept at 80°C in hot air oven for 30 minutes, did not show any change with 15     respect to its taste masking ability. It was substantially free from bitter taste associated with drug.<br>
