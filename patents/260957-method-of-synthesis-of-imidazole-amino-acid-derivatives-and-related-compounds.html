TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
METHOD OF SYNTHESIS OF IMIDAZOHE-AMINO ACID DERIVATIVES AND RELATED COMPOUNDS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not applicable<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR<br>
DEVELOPMENT The research and development of the invention described below was not federally sponsored.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1,3-Azole-containing amino acids have utility as analogues of natural amino acids for incorporation into biologically active molecules. In particular, they are constituent parts of many biologically active peptides and are useful in preparing antimicrobial agents. Currently, no general method for their synthesis exists.<br>
Saeed and Young have described the synthesis of L-beta-hydroxy amino acids using an enzymatic method (Saeed, A; Young, D.W; Tetr. 1992, 48, 2507-2514). Their method does not produce the 1,3-azole-containing amino acids synthesized by the present inventive method, and their route gives a mixture of isomeric forms.<br>
Kimura et al. report another enzymatic synthesis of beta-hydroxy-amino acids. (Kimura, T. etal., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997 119, 11734-11742). Their synthesis, however, provides mixed stereochemistry at the beta-carbon.<br>
Dalla Croce et al. report a stereoselective aldol addition of a chiral glycine enoiate synthon (Dalla Croce, P. et al., Heterocycles, 2000, 52, 1337-1344). Their method, however, produces only moderate yields and they do not report synthesis of any 1,3-azole-containing acids.<br>
Palian and Polt report synthesis of lipophilic beta-hydroxy amino acids (Palian, M; Polt, R., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66, 7178-7183). These authors do<br><br>
not describe the methods of the present invention and they do not describe the synthesis of 1,3-azole-containing amino acids.<br>
Zhao et al. reported oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids using TEMPO catalyst along with sodium chlorite and bleach (Zhao et al., J. Org. Chem., 1999, 64, 2564-2566). They did not apply their method, however, to produce beta-hydroxy amino acids.<br>
Barma et al. reported an oxidative removal of the N,N-dimethylthiocarbamate group from alcohols (Barma et al., Org. Lett., 2003, 5, 4755-4757). These authors do not describe the synthesis of 1,3-azole-containing amino acids.<br>
The Garner aldehydes (Garner, P. Terr. Lett, 1984, 25, 5855-5858; Liang, X, et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 2001, 2136-2157), for which both the S and R configurations are commercially available, are configurationally stable under many reaction conditions that are typically employed for the elaboration of the aldehyde functionality. Lubell and Rapoport introduced the phenylfluorenyl-protected oxazolidone as a serinal equivalent similar to Gamer's aldehyde, and the inclusion of the phenylfluoreny! moioty greatly stabilizes the configuration of the a-proton in products under basic conditions (Lubell, W; Rapoport, H; J. Org. Chem., 1989, 54, 3824-3831). it has seen only limited utility in organic synthesis and has been commented by Rapoport that the phenylfluorenyl group is known to be more acid-slab!e than the related trityl group for other substrates. Both of these substrates allow for the selective incorporation of nucleophiles into an intermediate for further derivatization.<br>
Dondoni has utilized a variety of chiral, alpha-amino aldehydes as reactants in a condensation reaction with 2-trimethylsilylthiazole (Dondoni, A, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55, 1439-1446). The use of Garner's aldehyde furmsned the best results in terms of yield and selectivity. Dondoni and others have generally utilized this thiazole chemistry as a method to incorporate a forrnyl group, rather than functionalize the portion of the molecule derived from Garner's aldehyde.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a generalized method to synthesize 1,3-azole-containing amino acids<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Examples 9-13 Selected compounds listed in Table 1 were prepared following the procedure outlined in Example 5 with appropriate selection and substitution of reagents, as listed in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
While the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present invention, with examples provided for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual variations, adaptations and/or modifications as come within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful as intermediates in the sylhesis of biologically important targets such as antimicrobial agents.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be present in the form of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" (Ref. International J. Pharm., 1986, 33, 201-217; J. Pharm.Sci., 1997 (Jan), 66, 1, 1). Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Representative organic or inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, benezenesulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic acid. Representative organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, basic or cationic salts such as benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, procaine, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in VIJO into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
The compounds according to this invention possess two or more chiral centers, they exist as enantiomers and diastereomers. it is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the<br><br>
compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention.  In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l4artaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
The processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention may give rise to products with tautomeric structural forms; wherein, the structures differ in the point of attachment of a hydrogen atom and exist in an equilibrium favoring the weaker acid. Such products include both keto-encl tautomers and imine-enamine tautomers and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention. Keto-enol tautomers refer to those compound structures wherein a hydroxy atom bonded to an aikenyl carbon (the stronger acid "enol" structure) exists in equilibrium with an oxygen atom bonded by a double-bond to an alkanyl carbon (the weaker acid "keto" structure), imine-enamine tautomers refer to those compound structures wherein a hydrogen substituted nitrogen atom bonded to an aikenyl carbon (the stronger acid "enamine" structure) exists in equilibrium with a nitrogen atom bonded via a double-bond to an alkanyl carbon (the weaker acid "imine" structure).<br><br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Even though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically, acceptable salts and pharmaceutical^/ acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical or veterinary practice. Thus, the present in vention is directed to pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions comprising compounds of Formula (I) or of Formula (II) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents.<br>
By way of example, in the pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions of the present invention, the compounds of the present invention may be admixed with any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), and/or solubiiising agent(s).<br>
Tablets or capsules of the compounds may be administered singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. It is also possible to administer the compounds in sustained release formulations.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the general Formula (I) or Formula (ii) can be administered by inhalation or in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream<br><br>
consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. They can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
For some applications, preferably the compositions are administered orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or coloring agents.<br>
The compositions (as well as the compounds alone) can also be injected parenterally, for example intracavemosally, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. In this case, the compositions will comprise a suitable carrier or diluent.<br>
For parenteral administration, the compositions are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood.<br>
For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner.<br>
By way of further example, pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions containing one or more of the compounds of the invention described herein as the active ingredient can be prepared by intimately mixing the compound or compounds with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the desired route of administration (e.g.. oral, parenteral). Thus for liquid oral preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, stabilizers, coloring agents and the like; fc solid oral preparations, such as powders, capsules and tablets, suitable carriers<br><br>
and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Solid oral preparations may also be coated with substances such as sugars or be enteric-coated so as to modulate the major site of absorption. For parenteral administration, the carrier will usually consist of sterile water and other ingredients may be added to increase solubility or preservation. Injectable suspensions or solutions may also be prepared utilizing aqueous carriers along with appropriate additives.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those skilled in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, bo continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutical composition is preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5,1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.<br>
It is also apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically effective dose for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof will vary according to the desired effect. Therefore, optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate therapeutic level. The above dosages are thus exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher<br><br>
or lower dosage ranges arc merited, and such are within the scope ot this invention.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and dosage regimens established in the art whenever use of the compounds of the invention as vanilloid receptor modulators is required for a subject in need thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical or veterinary pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br><br><br><br>
