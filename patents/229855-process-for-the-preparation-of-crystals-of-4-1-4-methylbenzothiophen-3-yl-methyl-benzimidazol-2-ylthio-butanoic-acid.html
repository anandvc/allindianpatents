				<td>Field of Invention<br><br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a crystal of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid, a process for producing the same, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the same. This compound has a chymase inhibitory activity in the living body and can be used as a preventive and/or remedy for inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, respiratory tract diseases, circulatory diseases, or bone and/or cartilage metabolic diseases.<br><br>
Background Art<br><br>
[0002] When a certain compound has two or more kinds of crystal forms, these different crystal forms are referred to as crystal polymorphism. It is commonly known that stability varies with each crystal form of crystal polymorphism. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 62-226980 describes that two kinds of crystal forms of prazosin hydrochloride have different stabilities and exert an influence on the results of long-term storage stability. Also Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 64-71816 describes that a specific crystal form among different crystal forms of buspirone hydrochloride is advantageous in view of retention of specific physical properties during storage or under manufacturing conditions.<br><br>
[0003] In the production of a drug substance for medicine, it is advantageous for the storage stability and control of manufacturing process of the drug substance and pharmaceutical composition to obtain the drug substance in a crystal form.<br><br>
[0004] In case a compound having two or more crystal forms is employed as a medicine, physicochemical properties such as melting point, solubility and stability, and pharmacokinetics such as, absorptivity, distribution, metabolism and excretion vary with each crystal, and thus biological properties such as appearance of drug efficacy vary sometimes. To ensure that the resulting medicine has stable properties described above, it is often required to produce a drug substance having a specific crystal form. Also in the process for production of the drug substance, it is important to precipitate a specific crystal form in the crystallization operation so as to maintain the yield and purification effect.<br><br>
[0005] It is impossible to anticipate the presence of crystal polymorphism by the structure of the compound, and it is considered to be important to find out a crystal form in the development of the medicine.<br><br>
[0006] As described in WO 00/03997 and WO 01/53291, it is known that 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid represented by the following formula (I) has an effect of inhibiting chymase.<br><emi id="1.0"><br><br>
[0007] However, there is not any description about the crystal or crystal polymorphism in the above references.<br><br>
[0008] Chymase is one of neutral proteinases present in mast cell granules and has a close relation with various vital reactions associated with mast cells. There have been reported various effects, for example, acceleration of degranulation from mast cells, activation of Interleukin-1- (IL-1 ), activation of matrix protease, decomposition of fibronectin and IV type collagen, acceleration of release of Transforming growth factor- (TGF- ), activation of material P and bathoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), effect of conversion from Angiotensin (Ang I) into Ang II, and Endothelin conversion effect. As is apparent from the above description, it is considered that an activity inhibitor against chymase is useful as a preventive and/or a remedy for respiratory tract diseases such as bronchial asthma; inflammatory and/or allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria; circulatory diseases such as sclerosing vascular lesion, intravascular stricture, peripheral circulatory disturbance, renal insufficiency, and cardiac insufficiency; and bone and/or cartilage metabolism diseases such as rheumatism and osteoarthritis.<br><br>

Preferred Mode of the Invention<br><br>
[0038] The crystal of the present invention is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern and/or an infrared absorption peak in potassium bromide and the like. These crystals yield a characteristic powder X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and each crystal has a specific value of 2 . These crystals also yield a specific absorption pattern in infrared spectrophotometry (IR).<br><br>
[0039] The crystal A of the present invention yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern at reflection angles 2 of approximately 9.0 deg. , 15.2 deg. , 16.4 deg. , 19.2 deg. , 20.6 deg. , 22.3 deg. and 22.6 deg. and, more specifically, it yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having a characteristic peak shown in Table 1 (see Fig. 1). In a powder X-ray diffraction pattern intensity in the table, Imax denotes an intensity of a peak having a largest intensity of each crystal and I denotes an intensity of each peak. The value of 2 of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern can vary by approximately 0.5 deg. with the state of samples and measuring conditions. Because of properties of data of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern, general pattern is important in the identification of crystal form. Since a relative intensity can slightly vary with the growth direction of crystals, size of particles and measuring conditions, it should not be strictly understood.<br><tb>Diffraction angle (2 , deg. )<sep>Intensity (I/Imax*100)<br><tb>9.0<sep>100<br><tb>15.2<sep>91<br><tb>16.4<sep>54<br><tb>19.2<sep>59<br><tb>20.6<sep>63<br><tb>22.3<sep>77<br><tb>22.6<sep>59<br><br>

[0047] The 2-propanolate crystal of the present invention yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern at reflection angles 2 of approximately 7.8 deg. , 12.0 deg. , 17.1 deg. , 20.1 deg. , 20.6 deg. , 22.7 deg. , 24.0 deg. and 25.2 deg. and, more specifically, it yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having a characteristic peak shown in Table 9 (see Fig. 9).<br><tb>Diffraction angle (2 , deg. )<sep>Intensity (I/Imax*100)<br><tb>7.8<sep>48<br><tb>12.0<sep>54<br><tb>17.1<sep>100<br><tb>20.1<sep>48<br><tb>20.6<sep>58<br><tb>22.7<sep>78<br><tb>24.0<sep>65<br><tb>25.2<sep>52<br><br>
[0048] By means of infrared spectrophotometry, the crystal A of the present invention has peaks at wave numbers of approximately 1711, 1442, 1285, 1252, 1204, 771 and 750 cm (see Fig. 10).<br><br>

[0050] The crystal D of the present invention has peaks at wave numbers of approximately 1703, 1441, 1383, 1321, 1245, 1196, 766 and 746 cm (see Fig. 12).<br><br>
[0051] The crystal E of the present invention has peaks at wave numbers of approximately 1716, 1286, 1221, 1196, 1144, 761 and 742 cm (see Fig. 13).<br><br>
[0052] The hydrate crystal of the present invention haspeaks at wave numbers of approximately 1705, 1310, 1288, 1248, 1194, 760 and 746 cm (see Fig. 14).<br><br>
[0053] The methanolate crystal of the present invention has peaks at wave numbers of approximately 1728, 1444, 1250, 1190, 1038, 764 and 748 cm (see Fig. 15).<br><br>
[0054] The ethanolate crystal of the present invention has peaks at wave numbers of approximately 1724, 1444, 1250, 1194, 1047, 766 and 746 cm (see Fig. 16).<br><br>

[0057] The wave number of the present invention by means of infrared spectrophotometry can vary by approximately 5 cm with the measuring conditions and the state of samples and the like.<br><br>
[0058] The crystal of the present invention can be obtained by various processes and typical examples thereof are shown below.<br><br>
[0059] The compound of the present invention, 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid can be synthesized by the processes described in WO 00/03997 or WO 01/53291. For example, 3-bromomethyl-4-methylbenzothiophene and methyl 4-(benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoate are subjected to a coupling reaction in a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene in the presence of an alkali such as tertiary amine to obtain methyl (1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoate. The resulting compound is hydrolyzed by an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and the like in a tetrahydrofuran solvent, and then neutralized to obtain (1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid.<br><br>
[0060] The stability of four kinds of crystals excluding the solvate becomes lower in the order of crystal D, crystal B, crystal A and crystal E, while the solubility in the solvent becomes higher in this order.<br><br>
[0061] The crystals A, B and D can be formed by a cooling crystallization process from a solution using various solvents, or a process for addition of a poor solvent to rich solvent solution. Examples of the solvent include acetone, anisole, ethanol, formic acid, ethyl formate, cumene, acetic acid, isobutyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, propyl acetate, methyl acetate, diethyl ether, t-butylmethyl ether, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, heptane, 1-pentanol, 4-methyl-pentanone, 2-butanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, 2-ethoxyethanol, hexane, pentane, methanol, 2-ethoxymethanol, methylcyclohexane, tetralin, toluene, xylene, water, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. Examples of the solvent, which is preferred from economical and industrial points of views, include acetic acid, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 2-butanone, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, toluene, xylene, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, water, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. Examples of more preferred solvent include acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, 2-butanone, water, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. As described hereinafter, since the alcoholate is likely to be crystallized, it is necessary to avoid the use of an alcohol having 3 or less carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or 2-propanol as a main solvent.<br><br>
[0062] In case the crystal A or B is obtained by a cooling crystallization process or a poor solvent addition process, it is preferred that the crystal D does not exist in 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid to be used as a raw material. Since the crystal D has drastically poor solubility in the solvent, its dissolution process requires not only a large amount of the solvent and high temperature, but also a long time, and thus formation of the crystal D is accelerated and also rapid decrease of the solution temperature during filtration of an insoluble matter with heating causes acceleration of formation of the crystal D. Also transition of the crystals A or B thus obtained to the crystal D is sometimes accelerated to form the crystal D.<br><br>
[0063] In case the crystal A or B is obtained by a cooling crystallization process or a poor solvent addition process, chemical purity of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid to be used as a raw material is deemed to be important. In case of a raw material containing a large amount of byproducts produced during the synthesis process, for example, a raw material having purity of 95% or less as measured by HPLC analysis, the crystal A is preferentially formed. In case of a raw material having comparatively high purity, for example, a raw material having purity of 97% or more as measured by HPLC analysis, the crystal B is preferentially formed. Starting material with a relatively high purity can be obtained by synthesis without forming substantial amount of byproducts, followed by purification by column chromatography or the like.<br><br>
[0064] In case the crystal A, B or D is obtained by a cooling crystallization process or a poor solvent addition process, the solution temperature is not specifically limited and is preferably 40 deg. C or higher and lower than the boiling point of the solvent used. The amount of the solvent is not specifically limited and is preferably from 5- to 100-fold, preferably not more than 50-fold, and more preferably not more than 20-fold the amount of the raw material. As used herein, a 1-fold amount refers to an amount (1 mL) of the solvent based on 1 g of the raw material. Examples of the solvent having high solubility, which is preferably used for the purpose of decreasing the amount of the solvent, include acetic acid and tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
[0065] In case the crystal A, B or D by a cooling crystallization process, it is effective to add a seed crystal having the same crystal form as that of the objective crystal. The amount is commonly from about 0.01% to 20%, and preferably from 0.1% to 10%, based on the raw-material, and it is preferred to previously grind the seed crystal. It is necessary that the solution temperature upon addition is within a super saturated range of the crystal to be obtained.<br><br>
[0066] The stirring conditions, cooling pattern and time required to collection by filtration after the starting of formation of the crystal A, B or D are not specifically limited. Since these conditions sometimes exert an influence on the yield, chemical purity, particle size and particle size distribution of the crystal, these conditions are preferably combined and set according to the purposes. In case of collection by filtration, a conventional process, for example, natural filtration, pressure filtration, filtration under reduced pressure or centrifugal separation can be employed. In case of drying, a conventional process, for example, natural drying, drying under reduced pressure, drying with heating or drying with heating under reduced pressure can be employed.<br><br>
[0067] The crystal D can be obtained by adding water or nonpolar hydrocarbon as a poor solvent, to an acetic acid solution of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid. Examples of the nonpolar hydrocarbon include pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. The higher the temperature of the acetic acid solution used to add the poor solvent, the better because the amount of acetic acid can be reduced, thereby to improve the yield. When the amount of poor solvent is small based on the acetic acid, a cooling crystallization state sometimes arises and thus the crystal D can not be formed. The amount of the poor solvent is more than half of the amount of acetic acid, and preferably the same as or more than that of acetic acid, although it varies with the solution temperature.<br><br>
[0068] The crystal B can be obtained by performing neutralization crystallization by the addition of acid to a solution of an alkali metal salt of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid and water, and tetrahydrofuran, methanol, 2-butanone, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them while maintaining at about 40 deg. C or higher. The alkali metal is preferably sodium or potassium. The alkali metal salt is obtained by reacting (1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid with an alkali, or hydrolyzing an ester of (1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid and a lower alcohol. The aqueous solution may contain an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methanol or 2-butanone. The amount of water based on the alkali metal salt varies with the kind and amount of the coexisting organic solvent, and is preferably 1- to 10-fold, and preferably from 2- to 5-fold the amount of the alkali metal salt so as to ensure a solution state at the neutralization temperature. Since strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid is sometimes crystallized by forming a strong acid salt of (1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid, an organic acid such as acetic acid is preferably used for neutralization.<br><br>
[0069] When the solution temperature of the salt during completion of neutralization is high, preferably about 50 deg. C or higher, the crystal B is formed. On the other hand, when the solution temperature is low, preferably about 40 deg. C or lower, the hydrate crystal is formed. Since acetic acid is also a rich solvent, the objective crystal can not be obtained sometimes in case of adding acetic acid in the amount more than that required for neutralization, and thus an attention must be paid.<br><br>
[0070] The crystal E can be obtained by drying a hydrate crystal. In case of drying, a conventional drying process, for example, natural drying, drying under reduced pressure, drying with heating or drying with heating under reduced pressure can be employed. To shorten the drying time, drying under reduced pressure or drying with heating under reduced pressure is preferably employed. During drying, a mixture of the hydrate crystal and the crystal E exists.<br><br>
[0071] Therefore, in case of obtaining the hydrate crystal, moderate dying conditions such as drying at room temperature under reduced pressure within a short time must be selected so that only adhesion water is removed.<br><br>
[0072] The methanolate, ethanolate, 1-propanolate and 2-propanolate crystals can be obtained by cooling crystallization from a solution of a solvent containing its alcohol as a main ingredient. As the solvent, an alcohol solvent alone is most preferred and may contain another solvent as far as it is a solvent other than the other alcohol. With respect to an alcohol having 4 or more carbon atoms, a corresponding alcoholate has never been found.<br><br>
[0073] Furthermore, the methanolate, ethanolate, 1-propanolate and 2-propanolate crystals can also be obtained by contacting the crystal E, the hydrate crystal or a mixture thereof with the corresponding alcohol. Specific examples of the process include a process of suspending the crystal E, the hydrate crystal or a mixture thereof in an alcohol and stirring the suspension, and a process of passing an alcohol through a container filled with the crystal E, the hydrate crystal or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
[0074] Since the crystal D is a stable crystal, it can also be produced by suspending the other crystal, which is the crystal A, crystal B, crystal E, hydrate crystal, alcoholate crystal, or mixed crystal of two or more kinds selected from them, in a solvent and transiting into the crystal D (transition mediated by the solvent).<br><br>
[0075] Examples of the solvent used for transition to the crystal D from the other crystal, which is mediated by the solvent, include acetone, anisole, ethanol, formic acid, ethyl formate, cumene, acetic acid, isobutyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, propyl acetate, methyl acetate, diethyl ether, t-butylmethyl ether, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, heptane, 1-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 2-butanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, cyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, 2-ethoxyethanol, hexane, pentane, methanol, 2-ethoxymethanol, methylcyclohexane, tetralin, toluene, xylene, water, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. Furthermore, examples of the solvent, which is preferred from economical and industrial points of views, include acetic acid, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 2-butanone, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, toluene, xylene, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, water, or a mixed solvent of two or more kinds selected from them. When a mixed solvent is used, it is preferred to transit in a state where the solvents are compatible.<br><br>
[0076] To shorten the time required for transition to the crystal D from the other crystal, which is mediated by the solvent, it is effective to add the crystal D as a seed crystal. The amount is commonly from about 0.01% to 20%, and preferably from 0.1% to 10% of the amount of the other crystal to be transitted, and it is preferred to previously grind the crystal. The seed crystal may be previously mixed with the raw material or added to the suspension later.<br><br>
[0077] The higher the temperature during transition from the other crystal to the crystal D, which is mediated by the solvent, the more the transition rate increases. To avoid decomposition of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid, the temperature is preferably controlled to 100 deg. C or lower.<br><br>
[0078] The amount of the solvent used during transition must be set so as to ensure a suspension state at the transition temperature, and is commonly from 2- to 100-fold, preferably not more than 50-fold, and more preferably not more than 20-fold the amount of the other crystal to be transited. In case the amount of the solvent is large and the amount of 4-(1-((4-methylbenzothiophen-3-yl)methyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio)butanoic acid to be dissolved is comparatively large, the crystal other than the crystal D may be precipitated during the cooling process up to the filtration temperature even if the entire precipitated crystal is transited to the crystal D, and thus the crystal D can be precipitated by decreasing the cooling rate.<br><br>
[0079] From the above-described points of view, the crystal D can be obtained by properly combining the transition temperature, the amount of the solvent and the cooling rate. It is preferred to stir because the transition rate increases.<br><br>
[0080] In case of obtaining a mixture of two or more kinds of crystals as the objective product, not only the respective crystals are separately produced and mixed, but also the mixture can be produced at a time. To obtain a mixture in the objective mixing ratio, conditions must be set based on detailed preparatory study. The mixing ratio varies with the combination and ratio of the crystals and may be calculated by analysis means such as powder X-ray diffraction pattern, infrared absorption spectrum, and thermal analysis. In that case, it is considered that transition mediated by the solvent as the production process is performed comparatively easily because the mixing ratio can be successively monitored.<br><br>
[0081] Although the respective crystals of the present invention can be distinguish from the other crystal form by a characteristic powder X-ray diffraction pattern or an infrared absorption spectrum, no reference is made concerning a contamination rate of the other crystal form. When a specific crystal alone is used, it is possible to permit contamination which can not be detected by its pattern or spectrum. When a specific crystal is used as a drug substance of the medicine, it is intended to permit incorporation of the other crystal.<br><br>
[0082] Any crystals of the present invention can be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredients of the medicine. These crystals can be used alone or used as a mixture of two or more kinds of them.<br><br>
