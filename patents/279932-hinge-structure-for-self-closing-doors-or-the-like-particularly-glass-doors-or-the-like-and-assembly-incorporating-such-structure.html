HINGE STRUCTURE FOR SELF-CLOSING DOORS OR THE LIKE, PARTICULARLY GLASS DOORS OR THE LIKE, AND ASSEMBLY INCORPORATING SUCH STRUCTURE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention finds application In the field of hinges and suspension hardware for doors or the like, and particularly relates to hinge structure for self-closing doors.<br>
The hinge structure of the invention can assure self-closing of any kind of door, window or shutter, whether horizontally or vertically oriented, particularly of glass doors.<br>
The Invention further relates to an assembly incorporating such hinge structure.<br>
Background of the Inventipp<br>
Hinge structure for self-closing doors or the like, particularly glass doors or the like are known In the art.<br>
These prior art hinge structures comprise, as is known, a stationary element to be fixed to the frame of a door, a first movable element to be attached to the door and plvotally mounted to the stationary element for rotating about a longitudinal axis between an open door position and a closed door position.<br>
These prior art hinge structures further comprise means for automatically returning the door to said closed position during opening thereof.<br>
These prior art hinge structures suffer from certain well-recognized drawbacks.<br>
 <br>
A first drawback is their bulky size, heavy weight and high cost, caused by their being formed of many different parts, which further complicate their assembly and maintenance.<br>
Furthermore, they exhibit poor versatility and have to be replaced or anyway adjusted as the door or frame on which they are mounted changes.<br>
Also, these prior art hinge structures do not assure controlled motion of the door during opening and closing thereof. This problem is particularly felt with glass doors, whose closing and opening movements must be smooth, to avoid irreversible damages to the door itself.<br>
However, the behavior of these prior art structures is highly affected by the mass of the door on which they are mounted.<br>
Furthermore, in operation, these prior art hinge structures are subjected to variations in their closing position, which leads to inconveniences and higher maintenance costs.<br>
Moreover, the known structures do not allow the automatic closing movement of the door upon the opening.<br>
From GB-A-396889 a hinge structure is known having all the features of the preamble of the claim 1.<br>
Summary of the invention The main object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks, by providing an hinge structure allowing for easy and convenient maintenance, that has high performance, simple construction and low cost properties.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a hinge structure that allows the automatic closing of the door from the open position.<br>
 <br>
A particular object is to provide a hinge structure that allows the controlled motion of the door with which it is connected.<br>
A further object is to provide a hinge structure that can support doors and windows of heavy weight without changing their behavior and without requiring any adjustment.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a hinge structure that has a minimized number of parts and can be adapted to multiple shells of different shapes and sizes.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a hinge structure that can keep its closing position unaltered with time.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a highly safe hinge structure that offers no resistance to the closing motion even when pulled abruptly.<br>
These and other objects, as better explained hereafter, are fulfilled by a hinge structure as defined in claim 1.<br>
Advantageously, the closing means may be held in the first operating chamber, and the hydraulic damping means may be held either in the first operating chamber or In a second operating chamber, other than the first chamber.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a hinge assembly for serf-closing doors or the like as defined in claim 18.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in accordance with the dependent claims.<br>

Detailed description of a few preferred embodiments Referring to the abcve figures, there are shown embodiments of a hinge structure for self-dosing doors or the like, generally designated by numeral 1, which may be mounted, preferably but without limitation, on glass doors.<br>
In all its embodiments, the hinge structure 1 essentially comprises a stationary element 2 to be fixed to a frame T of a door P and a movable element 3 to be fixed to the door P. The movable element 3 Is plvotally mounted to the stationary element 2 for rotating about a first longitudinal axis X between an open door position and a closed door position.<br>
The hinga structure 1 further comprises closing means, generally designated by numeral 4 and hydraulic damping means, generally designated by numeral 5, which may consist in the embodiments described herein without limitation, of a predetermined amount of oil.<br>
*<br>
The closing means 4 operate on the first movable element 3 for automatically returning the door to the closed position during opening, and the hydraulic damping means 5 operate on such element 3 to oppose and damp the movement produced by the closing means 4.<br>
A peculiar feature of the invention, common to all the embodiments described herein, is that the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5 are held in at least one first operating chamber 6 within the stationary element 2.<br>
 <br>
By this arrangement, a hinge structure can be obtained that allows controlled pivotal motion of the door, This means that, whan trie door is in an open door position, the closing means 4 will operate on the movable element 3 and generate a torque to cause the door P to rotate to its dosed position about the axis X. On the other hand, at each time, the hydraulic damping means 5 will operate on such movable element 3 to generate a resistant torque opposite to the torque generated by the closing means 4.<br>
The hinge structure of the invention also provides high safety, as It offers no resistance to the closing motion even when pulled abruptly. This will prevent any injury to careless users, particularly children. Regardless of the force exerted on the door, the latter will always return smoothly to the closed door position, thereby providing a childproof safety.<br>
The hinge structure of the Invention is also particularly efficient and cost effective, as It can keep Its Initial characteristics unaltered with time even when used in severe conditions with high moisture content and passage of moisture.<br>
Furthermore, thanks to the provision mat the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5 are wholly contained In at least one first dperatfng chamber 6 within the stationary element 2, the hinge structure 1 is particularly convenient to handle, and has a small size, and minimized space requirements. Therefore, its installation requires no particular masonry or excavation wonts. As shown in the annexed figures, the structure 1 is fixed to the frame of a door (or to a wall) along the vertical extension of the door, above the level of the floor or the wail to which the stationary element Is fixed.<br>
The closing means 4 Include a first cam element 11 unitary with the first movable element 3 and having a first substantially flat contact surface 16, and a first plunger element 12 movable within said first operating chamber 6 along a transversal axis Y between a compressed end stroke position, corresponding to the open door position, and an extended end stroke position, corresponding to the<br>
 <br>
dosed door position. The plunger element 12 has a front face 17 which is susceptible to contact engage the surface 16 of the cam element 11.<br>
According to the Invention, the first contact surface 1Q of the first cam element 11 is offset with respect to the longitudinal axis X by a predetermined distance g such as the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 in its extended end position is positioned beyond said longitudinal axis X.<br>
By this arrangement, an excellent control on the closing movement of the door is allowed. In fact, the offset of the contact surface 16 with respect to the longitudinal axis X allows the automatic closing of the door. This means that, when the door P Is closed, starting from the fully open position, as shown In Figure 8b, 22 and 31, thanks to the distance g between the axis X and the surface 16, the front face 17 of the piston element 12 will promptly (after a few degrees of rotation) start to interact with the surface 16, thereby rotating the door P to the closed door position, as shown in Figure 7a, 20 and 29.<br>
A first preferred, non exclusive embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 2 to 8, in which there is only one operating chambers 6 containing the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5,<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Figures 4a and 4b. the stationary element 2 may be defined by a base 7 to be fixed to the frame T by means of screws to be Inserted in the holes 8, a\ 8", 8", whereas the movabla element 3 may In turn comprise two half shells 9,9' to be clamped together by screws 10,10'.<br>
Advantageously, the closing means 4 may include a cam element 11, better shown in Figure 5a. which is able to pivot about the axis X Integraily with the movable element 3 and is susceptible of cooperating with a plunger element 12, better shown in Figure 5c, which is longitudinally movable within the operating chamber 6.<br>
 <br>
closed door position. The plunger element 12 has a front face 17 which is susceptible to contact engage the surface 16 of the cam etement 11.<br>
According to the Invention, the first contact surface 10 of the first cam element 11 is offset with respect to the longitudinal axis X by a predetermined distance g such as the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 in Its extended end position Is positioned beyond said longitudinal axis X.<br>
By this arrangement, an excellent control on the closing movement of the door is allowed. In fact, the offset of the contact surface 15 with respect to the longitudinal axis X allows the automatic closing of the door. This means that, whan tha door P Is closed, starting from the fully open position, as shown in Figure 8b, 22 and 31, thanks to the distance g between the axis X and the surface 16, the front face 17 of the piston element 12 will promptly (after a few degrees of rotation) start to interact with the surface 16, thereby rotating the door P to the closed door position, as shown in Figure 7a, 20 and 29.<br>
A first preferred, non exclusive embodiment of the Invention is shown In Figures 2 to 8, in which there is only one operating chambers 3 containing the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5.<br>
in this embodiment, as shown in Figures 4a and 4b, the stationary element 2 may be defined by a base 7 to be fixed to the frame T by means of screws to be Inserted in UIB holes 8, a', 8", 8", whereas the movable element 3 may In turn comprise two half snails 9,91 to be clamped together by screws 10,10'.<br>
Advantageously, the closing means 4 may include a cam element 11, belter shown in Figure 5a, which is able to pivot about the axis X Integrally with the movable element 3 and is susceptible of cooperating with a plunger element 12, better shown in Figure 5c, which is longitudinally movable within the operating chamber 6.<br>
 <br>
whole Is "packed" and introduced, with the help of a gasket 22, in the operating chamber 6, with the locking cap 19 defining the bottom wall thereof.<br>
It will be understood that the check valve 21 may be also mounted within the cover cylinder 20, as shown, for example in Figure 4b. In this case, the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 Is defined by the front face 23 of the cover cylinder 20.<br>
Aa particularly shown In Figures 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b, the end wall 32 of the plunger element 12, which defines the front face 17 thereof, is susceptibie of divld/ng the operating chamber 6 into a first and second variable volume compartments 33, 34, which are adjacent and in fluid communication with each other. The counter spring 18 is placed fn the first compartment 33.<br>
This embodiment of the hinge structure of the invention allows for very simple installation. The Installation procedure is simply carried out by fitting the pin 13 in the cylindrical receptacle 24 of the stationary element 2, connecting the side portions 16, 16' thereof to the movable element 3 by introducing the surfaces 25, 25' of the pin 13 in the receptacles 26,23' of the half shell 9', inserting the oil seals 27, 27\ if any, thrust bearings 28, 28' and thrust bearing supports 29, 29' in the receptacle 24, securing the pin 23 to the shell 9' using the screws 30, 30' and clamping together the half shell S and the half shell 9' so installed by the screws 10,10*. The plunger element 12, packed as described above, is Introduced in Its operating chamber 6, and the locking cap 19 is tightened.<br>
*<br>
Such assembly procedure Is completed by Introducing oil 5 in the operating chamber 6, for hydraulic damping of the closing movement produced by the closing means 4. For this purpose, a through hole 31 may be formed in the stationary element 2 to define an oil loading channel allowing communication between the operating chamber 6 and the external environment, as shown in Figure 4a. It will be understood that the amount of oil to be loaded in the chamber 6, as well as the volume of (fie latter, is variable depending on the mass of the door P to be moved.<br>
 <br>
The operation of the hinge structure 11s shown in Figures 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b.<br>
In the closed door position, as shown in Figure 7a, the flat surface 16 of the pin 13 and the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 are hi contact with, substantially parallel to and abutting against each other. The counter spring 13 Is pre-comprassed between the cylinder 20 and the cap 19. In this position, substantially the whole amount of oil 5 Is in the first variable volume compartment 33, which has the maximum volume. Also, the counter spring 18 is at its maximum elongation.<br>
Whan a user opens the door P by applying an externa) load EL thereto, the door P moves In the direction of arrow Ft from the closed door position to an open doar position, as shown in Figure 7b. This movement causes the flat surface 16 of the pin 13 to rotate about the axis X, and thence interact with the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 to compress the counter spring 18, The flat surface 16 of the pin 13 and the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 are angularly spaced apart by an angle ct which Increases as the door Is being opened, The end wait 32 of the plunger element 12 is thus displaced along the line Y in the direction V. At the same time, due to the motion of the partition wall 32, the oil 5 is transferred from the first compartment 33, whose volume decreases, to the second compartment 34, whose volume accordingly increases, through the orifice 35 of the check valve 21.<br>
In the embodiments illustrated herein, the check valve 21 Is defined by an elongate extension 36 of the end wall 32 coaxial to the cylindrical operating chamber 6 and is of the normally open type, i.e. allowing the passage of oil 5 from the first compartment 33 to the second compartment 34 while the door is being opened and preventing it from flowing back as the door Is being closed.<br>
Figure 8a shows the fully open door position. In this position, the flat surface 16 of the pin 13 and the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 are perpendicular to each other, As shown In this figure, substantially the whole amount of oil 5 is in the<br>
 <br>
second variable volume compartment 34, which has the maximum volume, while the first compartment 33 has the minimum volume. Also, the counter spring 18 is in Its maximum compression position, which corresponds to lis minimum elongation.<br>
When a user rotates the door P from the fully open door position or, equivalent^, when a user releases the door from a partly open door position (I.e. when the external load Et. no longer acts thereon), the closing means 4 will start to operate on the movable element 3 to automatically return the door P to the closed position. At the same time, the hydrauflc damping means 5 wiM start to operate on the movable element 3 to oppose and damp the closing movement produced by the closing means 4.<br>
Figure 8b shows the above condition, with the door P In a partly open door position during door closing, In the direction of arrow Fj. In this position, the flat surface 18 of the pin 13 and the front face 17 of ihe plunger element 12 are angularly spaced apart by an angle a which decreases as the door is being closed. The previously compressed spring 18 performs Its opposing action by pushing the front face 17 of the plunger element 12 against the surface 16 of the pin 13, thereby causing the surfaces 16 and 17 to slide one against the other and the end wait 32 to move along the line Y in the direction V. At'the same time, due to the motion of the partition wall 32, the oil 5 is transferred from the second compartment 34, whose volume starts to decrease, to the first compartment 33, whose volume accordingly increases. However, the oil 5 wilt no longer flow through the orifice 35 of the check valve 21, which Is closed, but will flow back into the first compartment 33 through a tubular space 37 between the side wall 38 of the operating chamber 6 and the side wail 39 of the cover cylinder 22 of the plunger element 12. Convenient adjustment of the size of the air space 37 may increase or decrease the damping effect provided by the oil 5, which makes the hinge structure of the Invention exceptionally safe.<br>
 <br>
In an alternative configuration of the Invention, as shown in Figure 10, at least one hole 40 may be formed on the side wall 39 of the cover cylinder 20 of the plunger element 12, to facilitate and/or control the backflow of oil 5 into the first compartment 33. Suitable configuration of the sizes and/or number of hales 40, allows to control the return movement of the door p to the closed door position.<br>
In a further alternative embodiment of the Invention, as shown In Figure 9, the structure 1 may comprise a screw 41 for throttling the air gap 37 and thereby adjusting its size as desired, to change the backflow velocity of the oil 5, and thus adjust the damping effect<br>
Figures 11 to 24 show without limitation a second embodiment of the hinge structure of the invention, generally designated by numeral 1', The latter essentially comprises a stationary element 2 and a movable element 3 to be fixed to a door P by the two half shells 42, 42'. The stationary element 2 is designed to be fixed to a stationary support S, such as a wall or a floor, through the skirting 43, as shown in Figure 24.<br>
This second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in mat, while the closing means 4 are held in a single first operating chamber 6, the hydraulic damping means 5 are held both in this first operating chamber 6 and In a second operating chamber 44, which Is in fluid connection therewith. As shown In Figure 14, both the first operating chamber 6 and the second operating chamber 44 are wholly contained in the box-like housing defined by the stationary element 2.<br>
This configuration allows controlled movement of very heavy doors P and/or gates. This result is achieved thanks to the second operating chamber 44, which provides additional volume for the hydrauffc damping means 5, whereby motion of objects of very large mass may be effectively controlled,<br>
in this second embodiment, the closing means comprise, in addition to the first cam element 11, a second cam element 45, which is able to pivot about the axis X<br>
 <br>
integrally with the first cam element 11, as particularly shown In Figure 17, Furthermore, the second cam element 45 cooperates with a second plunger element 48, which is longitudinally movable along the line Y' within the second operating chamber 44.<br>
Advantageously, the line Y, which Is defined by the axis of the second cylindrical operating chamber 44, ie parallel to the line Y of motion of the first cam element 11, thereby minimizing space requirements.<br>
In the second embodiment, the central portion 14 of the pin 13, which is always held within the stationary element 2 in a cylindrical receptacle 24, defines both the first cam element 11 and the second cam element 45.<br>
The pin 13 is then designed to be fixed to the movable element 3 by means of the attachment surfaces 25, 25' of the end portions 15, 16\ Particularly, the top surface 25 Is designed to be introduced in a groove 47 of the half shell 42 of the movable element 3, and the bottom surface 25' is Introduced In the skirting 43 to be fixed to the floor S.<br>
in this embodiment, both the first cam element 11 and the second cam element 45 are formed by specially shaping the central portion 14 of the pin 13. The first cam element 11, like In the first embodiment, comprises a first substantially fiat surface 16, parallel to the axis X and abutting against the front face 17 of the first plunger element 12. The second cam element 45, placed above the first, Is substantially defined by a wall 48 having a pair of second substantially flat surfaces 49, 49', parallel to the axis X and substantially perpendicular to the first surface 16.<br>
The wall 48, with its surfaces 49,49' abuts against the front face 50 of the second plunger element 46. Far this purpose, as better shown In Figure 18, the cylindrical receptacle 24 Is designed to communicate both with the first operating chamber 6 and with the second 44, at the area of contact between the first cam element 11<br>
 <br>
and the first plunger element 12 and at the area of contact between the second Gam element 46 and the second plunger element respectively.<br>
The latter, like the first piunger element, Is substantially composed of a second counter spring 51, a second locking cap 52, a second cover cylinder 53 and a second check valve 54, which defines means for controlling the flow of oil 5 In the second operating chamber 44. as explained above. The whole is "packed" and introduced, with the help of a second gasket 55, In the second operating chamber 44, with the locking cap 52 defining the bottom wall thereof.<br>
As particularly shown In Figures 20 to 23, the end wall 50 of the second plunger element 46 Is defined by a wall 56 which Is susceptible of dividing the second operating chamber 44 into a third and fourth variable volume compartments 57, 53, which are adjacent and in fluid communication wfth each other. The counter spring 51 is placed In the fourth compartment 58.<br>
The stationary element 2 has a channel 60, clearly shown in Figure 13, for putting the first and second operating chambers 6, 44 in fluid communication with each other. Furthermore, the channel 60 comprises a throttling screw 61, for adjusting the damping effect of the hydraulic means 5.<br>
in the second embodiment described herein, the check valve 21 is of the normally<br>
■<br>
open type, i.e. allowing the passage of oil 5 from the first compartment 33 to the second compartment 34 while the door is being opened and presenting ft from flowing back as the door Is being closed, whereas the check valve 54 Is of the normally closed type, i.e. allowing the passage of oil 5 from the third compartment 57 to the fourth compartment 59 while the door is being opened and preventing (t from flowing back as the door is being closed.<br>
This embodiment of the hinge structure of the Invention allows for very simple installation, like the first embodiment. The installation procedure is simply carried out by fitting the pin 13 In the cylindrical receptacle 24- of the stationary element 2,<br>
 <br>
connecting the side portions 15, 15' thereof to the movable element 3, as described above, inserting the oil seals 27, 27', if any, thrust bearings 28, 28" and thrust bearing supports 29,39' in the receptacle 24, and clamping together the half shell 42 and the half shell 42' so Installed by the screws 10, 10', 10", The first plunger element 12, packed as described above, Is Introduced in its operating chamber 6, and the locking cap 19 is tightened* whereas the second plunger element is designed to be packed and introduced In the second operating chamber 44.<br>
Such assembly procedure is completed by introducing oil 5 In the operating chambers S and 44, for hydraulic damping of the closing movement produced by the closing means 4, This may be accomplished using the loading channel 31 in the stationary element 2, which puts the external environment in communication with the second operating chamber 44, the latter being in turn In fluid communication with the first operating chamber 6. It will be understood that the predetermined amount of oil loaded through the channel 31 will be distributed among the first 33, the second 34, the third 57 and the fourth 68 variable volume compartments. The channel 31, which is particularly useful for adding oil 5 when needed, is closed by the cap 69,<br>
The operation of the hinge structure 1 is better shown in Figures 20 to 23.<br>
Figure 20 shows the relative position of the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5 in the closed door position. In this position, the front face 17 of the first plunger element 12 abuts against and is parallel to the flat surface 16 of the first cam element 11 to keep the door closed, like In the first embodiment. The front face 50 of the second plunger eiemsnt 46 abuts in turn against and is perpendicular to the wall 46 with its surfaces 49,49'.<br>
The first counter spring 1S is precompressed between the cylinder 20 and the cap 19, and the second counter spring 51 is compressed between the cap 52 and the cylinder 53. In this position, the first 33 and third 57 variable volume compartments have the maximum volume, and the second 34 and fourth 58 have the minimum<br>
 <br>
volume. Alec, the counter spring 18 is at its maximum elongation, and the second counter spring 51 has Its minimum elongation (maximum compression position),<br>
As the door P is opened, i.e. as an external load EL IS applied thereon, the movable element 3 will start to pivot about the axis X relative to the stationary element 2, the pin 13 will move in the direction of arrow Fi, and the first surface 26 of the first cam element 11 and the second surfaces 49, 49' of the second cam efement 45 will start to pivot Integrally therewith. This partly open door position during door opening Is shown in figure 21.<br>
Due to the rotation of the pin 13, and the resulting thrust exerted by the surface 16 on ttie front face 17 of the first plunger element 12. the latter starts to move along the line Y In the direction V, At the same time, the second plunger element 46 starts to move along Die Jine V in the direction V opposite to the direction V. As the door is being opened, the angle a between the first flat surface 16 of the pin 13 and the front face 17 of the first plunger element 12 starts to increase, whereas the angle p between the flat surfaces 49, 49' of the second plunger element 46 starts to decrease.<br>
*<br>
Thus, the volume of the first compartment 33 starts to decrease, as loading of the first spring 18 occurs. Furthermore, aa the volume of the first compartment 33 decreases, the oil 5 therein starts to flow out through the orifice 36 of the valve 21 Into the second variable volume compartment 34, which starts to receive oil 5 and increases its volume.<br>
At the same time, due to the rotation of the surfaces 49', 49 and the resulting thrust exerted by the front face 50 of the second plunger element 46 thereon, the volume of the fourth compartment 53 starts to increase, as release of the second spring 51 occurs. Also, the volume of the third compartment 57 starts to decrease, therefore the oil 5 therein starts to flow Into the fourth compartment 58, whose volume accordingly increases.<br>
 <br>
Figure 22 shows the fully open door position. It will be appreciated that the device of the invention allows 90" opening of the door also in the other direction. In this position, the fourth compartment 58 will have the maximum volume, whereas the second compartment 34 will have the minimum volume. The first spring 18 Is in its" maximum load condition (minimum elongation), and the second spring 51 is in its minimum load condition (maximum elongation).<br>
As a user releases the door or moves it from the position of Figure 22 to the closed position, the first spring 18 starts to be released, and the first plunger element 12 starts to push on the surface 16 of the pin 13 thereby rotating ft In tie direction of arrow Fj back to the closed door position. At the same time, the surfaces 49, 49' compress the second spring 51, so that the volume of the fourth compartment 58 starts to decrease and oil flows out of it.<br>
Figure 23 shows the above condition, with the door P in a partly open door position during door dosing, in the direction of arrow F2. In this position, the first flat surface 16 of the pin 13 and the front faca 17 of the first plunger element 12 are angularly spaced apart by an angle a which decreases as the door Is being closed, whereas the second flat surfaces 49,49' of the pin 13 and the front face SO of the second plunger element 46 are angulariy spaced apart by an Increasing angle p.<br>
The previously compressed first spring 1S performs its opposing action by pushing the front face 17 of the first plunger element 12 against the first surface 16 of the pin 13, thereby causing the surfaces 16 and 17 to slide one against the other and the first end wall 32 to move along the iine Y In the direction V. Now, the second spring 51 is also compressed due to the pressure of the second wall 48 of the second cam element 45 against the second plunger element 46, which moves along the line r In the direction V, opposite to the direction V.<br>
The second valve 54 is of the normally closed type and does not allow the passage of the working fluid through its orifice 62, whereby oii 5 Is forced to flow<br>
 <br>
out at the hole 63 into the air gap 63 defined by the side walls 65, 66 of the second operating chamber 44 and the second cover cylinder 53 respectively. The outflowing oil 5 flows through the channel 60 Into the first compartment 33 whose volume progressively increases.<br>
The first valve 21, which Is of the normally open type, does not allow the passage of oit 5 through its orifice 35, wherefore oil will flow from the second compartment 34 to the third compartment 57, which are in fluid communication with each other.<br>
In fact, In the second embodiment as shown in the figures, the working fluid follows a counter-clockwise path within the box-like housing defined by the stationary element 2, to hydraulically delay the rotary motion of the movable element 3 with respect to the return movement thereof to the closed door position. Likewise, the working fluid is also delayed during door opening, so that the hinge structure of the invention Is highly safe even for outdoor installations, In which wind or a careless user might exert an excessive load on the door.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, as shown in FIG. 19, the first cam element 11 of the pin 13 may have a rounded peripheral surface, e.g. formed by turning, to allow the door P to be moved back to the closed door position from any open door position. This embodiment is particularly advantageous for Are doors.<br>
Figures 25 to 32 show a preferred, non exclusive embodiment of a hinge assembly, generally designated by numeral 70, to be mounted on self-closing doors P or Hie like. The assembly 70 comprises a first and a second hinge structures 71 and 72, each comprising a stationary element 2,2' to be fixed to the frame T of the door P and a movable element 3, 3' to be fixed to the door P. The movable elements 3, 3' ara plvotady mounted to their respective stationary elements 2, 2' for rotating about the axis X. In this embodiment, tile door P acts as a "drive shaft" between the two hinge structures 71,72.<br>
 <br>
As particularly shown in Figure 28, the closing means 4 and the hydraulic damping means 5 are held in two operating chambers 6, 44 within the box-like housing defined by the first stationary element 2 of the first hinge structure 71, whereas the second hinge structure 72 comprises second damping means 80, which may also consist of a predetermined amount of the same oil as used In the first hinge structure 71, contained In another operating chamber 81 within the box-like housing defined by the second stationary element 2*.<br>
In other words, the first hinge structure 71 operates on the movable element 3 (and thence on the movable element 3') to generate the torque C required to cause the door P to pivot to its closed position about the axis X, whereas the second hinge structure 72 operates on its movable element 3' (and thence on the movable element 3) to hydraullcally damp the movement produced by the hinge structure 71, thereby generating a resistant torque C opposite the torque C.<br>
This configuration allows for optimized motion control of very heavy doors and gates, during both the opening and closing movements.<br>
Concerning both construction and operation, the first hinge structure 71 is very similar to the first embodiment as shown herein in Figures 1 to 10, or to the lower half of the second embodiment as shown herein in Figures 11 to 24, However, the second hinge structure 72 is very similar, Btill in terms of construction and operation, to the upper half of the second embodiment as shown herein In Figures 11 to 24. The only functional and structural difference between the latter and the hinge assembly 70 Is that the operating chambers 6, 44 and the operating chamber 81 are not in fluid communication with each other, although their operation Is identical. In an alternative embodiment, the assembly 70 of the invention may be formed of the first embodiment of the hinge structure, as shown In Figures 1 to 10 (with the closing means held in a single operating chamber 6) and the hinge structure 72.<br>
 <br>
The second hinge structure 72 comprises a second pjn 13' having a corresponding contact surface 92 which is designed to interact with another plunger element 83 associated to the second damping means 80.<br>
The contact surface 82 of the second pin 13' is substantially perpendicular to the surfaces 1fl and 49 of the first pin 13 of the first hinge structure 71.<br>
Furthermore, the second pin 13' has a central portion 14' that defines a corresponding cam element 86, as well as side portions 87, 87' that are appropriately shaped for connection with the second movable element 3'.<br>
The cam element 88 interacts with the corresponding plunger element 83 as described above.<br>
The second hinge structure 72 further comprises a corresponding check valve 84 located at an end wall 85 of the plunger element 33 to allow the passage of oil 80 during door closing and prevent backflow thereof during door opening. The wall 85 divides the operating chamber 81 into respective variable volume compartments 88 and 80, a counter spring 90 being located in the compartment designated by numeral 88.<br>
As particularly shown in Figures 29 to 32, the check valves 21, 54 and 84 associated to their respective plunger elements 12,46 and 83 are of the normally open type.<br>
A further difference between the second hinge structure 72 and the upper half of the second embodiment ss shown In Figures 11 to 24 is that Ihe second check valve 64 is of the normally open type (like the first valves 21, 54), i.e. allows the passage of oil 5 from the fourth compartment 58 to the third compartment 57 during door opening and prevents backflow thereof during door closing.<br>
 <br>
J<br>
Thus, unlike the second embodiment as shown in Figures 11 to 24, the first valves 21, 54 and the second check valve 84 operate in the same directions, i,e, open during door opening and close during door closing.<br>
The first and second hinge structures 71 and 72 are assembled in the same manner as those described above. Two channels 78, 79 are provided for filling oil 5 once the assembly has been completed.<br>
In operation, the first and second hinge structures 71, 72 are mounted to the door P and cooperate to control its pivotal movement about the axis X. As shown In Figure 26, their pins 13 and 13' are configured In such a manner that the overlapping fiat surfaces of the former and the opposite fiat surfaces 82, 82' of the latter are perpendicular to each other.<br>
To adjust the alignment of the door P, the first hinge structure 71 may have suitable adjustment dowels 75, 76.<br>
The operation of the assembly 70 is identical to that of the second embodiment of the hinge structure as shown in Figures 11 to 24, except that the How of oil 5 is controlled by normally open check valves 21, 54, whereas the oil 80 Is controlled by the valve 84, which is of the same type.<br>
Figure 29 shows the first and second hinge structures 71,72* in the closed door P position, and Figure 31 shows the first and second hinge structures 71, 72 in the fully open door P position. It witt be understood that, white Figures 29 to 32 only show the upper portion of the hinge structure 71, the parts of the lower portion, not shown, operate exactly like those of the upper portion-As the door P is opened by a user, i.e. as an external load EL Is applied thereon, e.g. in it\B direction of arrow Fi as shown in Figure 30, the first pin 12 and the second pin 13' pivot about the axis X and cause the overlying surface 18 and the opposite flat surfaces 82, 82* respectively to rotate about the same axis X. The<br>
 <br>
spring 18 of the first plunger element 12 starts to be compressed, whereas the spring 90 starts to be released.<br>
Thus, the volume of the first compartment 33 starts to decrease, as loading of the first spring 18 occurs. Furthermore, as the volume of the first compartment 33 decreases, the ol! 5 therein starts to flow out through the orifice 35 of the valve 21 into the second variable volume compartment 34, which starts to receive oil 5 and increases its volume.<br>
At the same time, due to the rotation of the surfaces 82', 82, the volume of the compartment 89 starts to increase, as the spring 90 starts to be released. Also, the volume of the compartment 88 starts to decrease, therefore the oii 80 therein starts to flow into the adjacent compartment 89, whose volume accordingly increases. However, since the valve 84 is of the normally open type, the oii 80 cannot pass through the orifice of the valve, and will flow into the compartment 69 through an air gap 91 between the side wall 92 of the operating chamber 81 and the side wall 93 of the plunger element 83.<br>
As a user releases the door or moves It from the position of Figure 31 to the closed position, the first spring 18 starts to be released, and the first plunger element 12 starts to push on the surface 16 of the pin 13 thereby rotating it in the direction of arrow Fa back to the closed door position. At the same time, the surface 62 (or 82', depending on the door opening direction) compresses the spring 90, so that the volume of the compartment 89 starts to decrease and oil 80 flows out of it<br>
Figure 32 shows the above condition, with the door P in a partly open door position during door closing, in the direction of arrow Fa. The previously compressed first spring 18 performs its opposing action by pushing the front face 17 of the first plunger element 12 against the first surface 16 of the pin 13. thereby causing the surfaces 19 and 17 to slide one against the other and the first end wall 32 to move along the line Y in the direction V. Now, the second spring 90 is also<br>
 <br>
compressed due to the pressure of the cam element 36 against the plunger element 83, which moves along the line V in the direction V, opposite to the direction V.<br>
The first valve 21, which is of the normally open type, does not allow the passage of oil 6 through its orifice 35, wherefore oil will flow from the second compartment 34 to the first compartment 33 through the air gap 37 between the side wall 38 of the operating chamber B and the side wall 39 of the cylinder 20. The valve 84, wHIsh is also of the normally open type, allows the passage of oil 80 through Its orifice, to cause it to flow from the variable volume compartment 89 to the compartment 88,<br>
It will be understood that both the first 71 and the second 72 hinge structures may include fluid flow control means, like in the first and second embodiments described hereinbefore. This will afford control during both opening and dosing of the door P. Thus, the door may be designed to oppose no {or very low) resistance at law closing speeds, and to increase its resistance as the door P closing speed Increases.<br>
Thanks to this arrangement, if the door is mounted outdoors, it can be designed to be easily opened by users, while not being slammed because of external agents, such as wind or the like.<br>
The above disclosure clearly shows that the hinge structure and assembly of the invention fulfill the intended objects and particularly meet the requirement of assuring controlled movement of the door both during opening and closing thereof.<br>
During door closing, such controlled movement prevents the door from banging against its frame, thereby ensuring integrity and long life thereof. On the other hand, during opening, such controlled movement will prevent any abrupt opening of the door P due to gusts of wind, to protect both the door and any user within its operating range.<br>
 <br>
The hinge structure and assembly of the invention are susceptible of a number of changes and variants, within the inventive concept disclosed in the appended claims. All the details thereof may be replaced by other technically equivalent parts, and the materials may vary depending on different needs, without departure from the scope of the Invention.<br>
While the hinge structure and assembly have been described with particular reference to the accompanying figures, the numerals referred to In the disclosure and claims are only used for the sake of a better intelligibility of the Invention and shall not be intended to limit the claimed scope in any manner.<br>
