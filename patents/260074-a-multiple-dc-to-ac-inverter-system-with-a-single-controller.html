MULTIPLE INVERTER SYSTEM WITH SINGLE CONTROLLER<br>
AND RELATED OPERATING METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to electrical machinery, and<br>
more particularly relates to a DC-to-AC inverter system suitable for use with a<br>
traction system in an electric or hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] An inverter is an electrical component that can be configured to<br>
convert a DC signal into an AC signal. The prior art is replete with different<br>
inverter designs, inverter controller designs, and electromechanical systems<br>
that incorporate inverters. For example, an electric (or hybrid) vehicle may<br>
employ one or more DC-to-AC inverters as a power source for the motor.<br>
Some heavy duty vehicles utilize multiple inverters in a combined<br>
arrangement that is capable of powering a high power/torque multiphase AC<br>
motor.<br>
[0003] Conventional multiple inverter systems utilize separate controllers<br>
for each inverter. For example, a four-inverter system typically includes four<br>
distinct controllers. The use of additional controllers in this manner results in<br>
increased cost, increased weight, and increased physical size requirements,<br>
which is undesirable in most practical deployments.<br>
[0004] In some multiple inverter systems the outputs of two or more<br>
inverters may be connected together for purposes of driving the motor. In<br>
conventional systems, if one of the "combined" inverters fails, then the<br>
remaining inverters may be overdriven into an undesirable and potentially<br>
damaging over-current condition. To address this situation, conventional systems might shut down the remaining inverters, thus protecting them.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the disabling of healthy inverters results in a loss of drive<br>
power, which can render some heavy duty vehicles inoperable.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to have a multiple DC-to-AC inverter<br>
system that can be realized with less physical components, resulting in cost<br>
savings, reduced weight, and reduced size. In addition, it is desirable to have a<br>
multiple DC-to-AC inverter system having an automatic redundancy and<br>
protection feature. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of<br>
the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A multiple DC-to-AC inverter system as described herein includes<br>
a single controller that generates and provides the necessary gate drive signals<br>
for the multiple inverters. The controller is also configured to provide an<br>
intelligent redundancy and protection feature that reacts to a failure in one or<br>
more of the inverters in the system.<br>
[0007] The above and other aspects of the invention may be carried out in<br>
one form by a multiple DC-to-AC inverter system. The system comprises: a<br>
plurality of inverters, each having a DC input and an AC output, and each<br>
being configured to generate, at its AC output, a respective AC output signal<br>
in response to a DC input signal applied to the DC input; a plurality of gate<br>
drives, each having a gate drive input and a gate drive output coupled to a<br>
respective inverter, and each being configured to produce, at its gate drive<br>
output, an inverter drive signal set in response to a gate drive signal set; and a<br>
controller having a plurality of gate drive signal outputs, each being coupled to<br>
a respective gate drive. The controller is configured to generate, at the gate<br>
drive signal outputs, a plurality of gate drive signal sets for the gate drives.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0015] The invention may be described herein in terms of functional<br>
and/or logical block components and various processing steps. It should be<br>
appreciated that such block components may be realized by any number of<br>
hardware, software, and/or firmware components configured to perform the<br>
specified functions. For example, an embodiment of the invention may<br>
employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, digital<br>
signal processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or the like, which<br><br>
[0019] FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an electrical system 100<br>
suitable for use with an electric or hybrid vehicle. Electrical system 100<br>
generally includes a battery 102, a smoothing capacitor 104, an inverter 106, a<br>
controller 108, and a motor 110. Battery 102 has a positive terminal coupled<br>
to a power bus 112 and a negative terminal coupled to a negative bus 114.<br>
Capacitor 104 has a first terminal coupled to power bus 112 and a second<br>
terminal coupled to negative bus 114. Capacitor 104 is large enough to<br>
smooth power bus ripples that may be generated during operation of a<br>
practical system.<br>
[0020] Motor 110 is a three-phase AC motor having three terminals<br>
connected for respective phases thereof. Controller 108 has six output<br>
terminals for providing two inverter drive signals associated with each of the<br>
three phases of motor 110. Controller 108 may also include a clock generator<br>
circuit 116 that provides a clock signal labeled "CLK1" in FIG. 1. Although<br>
not shown in FIG. 1, controller 108 may include or be coupled to a gate drive<br>
that is suitably configured to amplify the power of control signals to the level<br>
required by inverter 106. Alternatively, inverter 106 may include or be<br>
coupled to the gate drive. Controller 108 internally is implemented as a digital<br>
microcontroller with a central processing unit, memory, and input/output<br>
circuitry. The input/output circuitry includes pulse width modulation ("PWM") circuitry that generates output waveforms having duty cycles<br>
corresponding to the inverter drive signals required for driving the three<br>
phases of motor 110 at the appropriate time to cause the rotor of motor 110 to<br>
turn at the desired speed or to produce the desired torque.<br>
[0021] Inverter 106 includes six solid state semiconductor switches (which<br>
may be realized as transistors, as described below) and six diodes. In FIG. 1,<br>
the transistors are identified by reference numbers 118, 120, 122, 124, 126,<br>
and 128, and the protection diodes are identified by reference numbers 130,<br>
132, 134, 136, 138, and 140. Transistor 118 has a terminal connected to<br>
power bus 112, a gate for receiving a first PWM inverter drive signal<br>
associated with a first phase of motor 110 from controller 108, and a terminal<br><br>
connected to a first phase winding of motor 110. Transistor 120 has a terminal<br>
connected to the terminal of transistor 118, a gate for receiving a second PWM<br>
inverter drive signal associated with the first phase of motor 110 from<br>
controller 108, and a terminal connected to negative bus 114. Transistor 122<br>
has a terminal connected to power bus 112, a gate for receiving a first PWM<br>
inverter drive signal associated with a second phase of motor 110 from<br>
controller 108, and a terminal connected to a second phase winding of motor<br>
110. Transistor 124 has a terminal connected to the terminal of transistor 122,<br>
a gate for receiving a second PWM inverter drive signal associated with the<br>
second phase of motor 110 from controller 108, and a terminal connected to<br>
negative bus 114. Transistor 126 has a terminal connected to power bus 112, a<br>
gate for receiving a first PWM inverter drive signal associated with a third<br>
phase of motor 110 from controller 108, and a terminal connected to a third<br>
phase winding of motor 110. Transistor 128 has a terminal connected to the<br>
source of transistor 126, a gate for receiving a second PWM inverter drive<br>
signal associated with the third phase of motor 110 from controller 108, and a<br>
terminal connected to negative bus 114. Each diode has a cathode connected<br>
to a first terminal of a respective one of the transistors, and an anode<br>
connected to a second terminal of that transistor.<br>
[0022] The basic topology and operation of inverter 106 can be leveraged<br>
by a multiple DC-to-AC inverter system configured to drive a vehicle traction<br>
system. In this regard, FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a multiple DC-<br>
to-AC inverter system 200 configured in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the invention. Although inverter system 200 is designed to<br>
drive a six-phase motor 202, the invention is not limited to any specific<br>
configuration. Indeed, the invention as described herein can be utilized in<br>
connection with any system having any number (greater than one) of inverters,<br>
each inverter in the system can have any number of phases, and the motor<br>
driven by the system can have any number of phases.<br>
[0023] Inverter system 200 generally includes a first inverter 204, a<br>
second inverter 206, a third inverter 208, a fourth inverter 210, a first gate<br><br>
drive 212 for first inverter 204, a second gate drive 214 for second inverter<br>
206, a third gate drive 216 for third inverter 208, a fourth gate drive 218 for<br>
fourth inverter 210, and a controller 220. Each inverter has a respective DC<br>
input and a respective AC output, and each inverter is suitably configured to<br>
generate, at its AC output, a respective AC output signal in response to a DC<br>
input signal applied to its DC input (as described above in connection with<br>
inverter 106). In this example, a DC input signal 222 is common to all of the<br>
inverters. It should be understood that DC input signal 222 is carried by two<br>
leads in practical embodiments.<br>
[0024] In this example, first inverter 204 cooperates with fourth inverter<br>
210 to provide a first combined AC output signal 224 for motor 202, and<br>
second inverter 206 cooperates with third inverter 208 to provide a second<br>
combined AC output signal 226 for motor 202. In this regard, the AC output<br>
of first inverter 204 may be coupled to the AC output of fourth inverter 210,<br>
and the AC output of second inverter 206 may be coupled to the AC output of<br>
third inverter 208 (as depicted in FIG. 2). In FIG. 2, inverter system 200<br>
includes four AC outputs corresponding to the four inverters. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, inverter system 200 may include a plurality of "combined" AC<br>
outputs, where each combined AC output is configured to provide a combined<br>
AC output signal from a respective subset of the inverters. For example,<br>
inverter system 200 could employ two combined AC outputs: one for first<br>
combined AC output signal 224 and one for second combined AC output<br>
signal 226.<br>
[0025] In practice, inverter system 200 is powering six-phase motor 202<br>
using two independent sets of three-phase windings. The three-phase motor<br>
windings powered by first inverter 204 and fourth inverter 210 are<br>
independent from the three-phase motor windings powered by second inverter<br>
206 and third inverter 208. Motor 202 is built with two sets of windings for<br>
increased reliability, however, the scope of the invention is not limited by this<br>
particular configuration. In order to balance the currents into the two sets of<br>
windings, controller 220 measures or detects the currents of two of the three<br><br>
phases of each winding set. Such detection may be achieved with a first<br>
current sensor set 228 and a second current sensor set 230, each of which is<br>
configured to provide feedback information (which may be a current<br>
measurement or any quantity, signal, or data indicative of measured current)<br>
back to controller 220 for closed-loop control.<br>
[0026] Each gate drive of inverter system 200 has a gate drive input<br>
(which may be configured to accommodate any number of different input<br>
signals) and a gate drive output (which may be configured to accommodate<br>
any number of different output signals). The gate drive input is coupled to<br>
controller 220, and is preferably configured to facilitate bi-directional<br>
communication with controller 220 as depicted in FIG. 2. The gate drive<br>
output is coupled to the respective inverter corresponding to the gate drive.<br>
Each gate drive is suitably configured to receive a gate drive signal set from<br>
controller 220, and to produce, at its gate drive output, an inverter drive signal<br>
set in response to the received gate drive signal set. As used herein, a "signal<br>
set" means a group of related or associated signals (e.g., control, drive, sensor,<br>
fault status, or other signal) for a single component. For example, controller<br>
220 generates a plurality of gate drive signals for each gate drive, to facilitate<br>
proper generation of the three-phase AC output signals. In this context, a<br>
plurality of gate drive signals for one gate drive may be included in a gate<br>
drive signal set.<br>
[0027] Controller 220 includes a plurality of gate drive signal outputs,<br>
each coupled to one of the gate drives (more particularly, coupled to the gate<br>
drive input of the gate drive). Controller 220 is configured to generate, at its<br>
gate drive signal outputs, the plurality of gate drive signal sets for the gate<br>
drives. Thus, controller 220 generates and delivers control signals to the four<br>
gate drives. The gate drives function to amplify the power of the gate drive<br>
signals to levels required by the inverters. In this example, the gate drives also<br>
provide to controller 220 information about the status of the individual<br>
inverters. Consequently, in a practical embodiment, controller 220 may utilize<br>
a plurality of gate drive input/output groups for control signal outputs and gate<br><br>
 drive status inputs, where each input/output group corresponds to a respective<br>
one of the inverters in inverter system 200. In order to reduce system<br>
complexity and cost, the currents of the individual inverters are not measured<br>
separately in this embodiment. Rather, the currents are measured by current<br>
sensor sets 228/230 after the parallel connection of the inverter pairs.<br>
[0028] Under normal operating conditions, controller 220 controls all four<br>
inverters. During normal operation, the gate drive signal set for first inverter<br>
204 corresponds to the gate drive signal set for fourth inverter 210, and the<br>
gate drive signal set for second inverter 206 corresponds to the gate drive<br>
signal set for third inverter 208. In other words, first and fourth inverters<br>
204/210 are driven with identical or equivalent drive signals, while second and<br>
third inverters 206/208 are driven with identical or equivalent drive signals<br>
(that are independent of the drive signals for first and fourth inverters<br>
204/210). In practice, inverter system 200 leverages the fact that the inverters<br>
have very similar operating characteristics and that a pair of inverters will<br>
share current once they are coupled in parallel.<br>
[0029] If one of the four inverters fails (or is otherwise deemed faulty by<br>
inverter system 200) and its protection system shuts it down, the remaining<br>
inverter in the parallel combination may become overloaded as a result of an<br>
over-current condition. The conventional approach to this problem is to<br>
permanently shut down both inverters in the parallel combination. Inverter<br>
system 200, however, need not permanently disable both inverters. Rather,<br>
controller 220 is suitably configured to detect a fault status for the faulty<br>
inverter, determine new operating parameters for the healthy or non-faulty<br>
inverter in the parallel combination, and generate an updated gate drive signal<br>
set for the healthy inverter. The updated gate drive signal set is influenced by<br>
the new operating parameters and is generated to prevent an over-current<br>
condition in the non-faulty inverter. Controller 220 may also disable the<br>
faulty inverter in response to the fault status (for example, if the fault status<br>
indicates a failure for the faulty inverter). In addition, the updated gate drive<br>
signal set may include a disabling gate drive signal set that functions to disable<br><br>
the non-faulty inverter. As mentioned above, the fault status may be provided<br>
by the gate drive for the faulty inverter.<br>
[0030] In the example embodiment shown in FIG. 2, if first inverter 204<br>
fails, controller 220 will update the gate drive signals for fourth inverter 210<br>
while maintaining the original gate drive signals for second and third inverters<br>
206/208. If second inverter 206 fails, controller 220 will update the gate drive<br>
signals for third inverter 208 while maintaining the original gate drive signals<br>
for first and fourth inverters 204/210. If third inverter 208 fails, controller 220<br>
will update the gate drive signals for second inverter 206 while maintaining<br>
the original gate drive signals for first and fourth inverters 204/210. If fourth<br>
inverter 210 fails, controller 220 will update the gate drive signals for first<br>
inverter 204 while maintaining the original gate drive signals for second and<br>
third inverters 206/208.<br>
[0031] The updated gate drive signals allow inverter system 200 to operate<br>
at a lower output power level without having to disable the non-faulty<br>
inverters that are combined with the faulty inverter. If both inverters of a<br>
parallel combination fail, then motor 202 will be powered by the remaining set<br>
of two parallel inverters, at a further reduced performance level. An over-<br>
current condition is not an issue in this situation because each of the<br>
independent groups of inverters has a separate set of gate drive signals and a<br>
separate current feedback measurement component.<br>
[0032] FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a controller 300 suitable for<br>
use with inverter system 200. Controller 300 has been simplified for purposes<br>
of this description; a practical controller 300 will include additional features,<br>
elements, and functionality related to conventional operating aspects that need<br>
not be described herein.<br>
[0033] Controller 300 generally includes input/output logic 302, a<br>
processor 304, memory 306, a signal generator 308, a clock generator 310, and<br>
fault detection logic 312. Controller 300 may employ a bus 313 that facilitates<br>
communication between these components as necessary. Input/output logic<br>
302 is configured to receive current sensor measurement information 314 from<br><br>
any number (M) of current sensor sets, and to generate any number (TV) of gate<br>
drive signal sets for a like number of gate drives to which controller is<br>
coupled. These signals may be associated with input/output groups 316 of<br>
controller 300. Input/output groups 316 may also support the communication<br>
of fault status information from the gate drives to controller 300.<br>
[0034] Processor 304 may be realized as a microprocessor, a controller, a<br>
microcontroller, or a state machine. A processor may also be implemented as<br>
a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a digital signal<br>
processor and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more<br>
microprocessors in conjunction with a digital signal processor core, or any<br>
other such configuration. Processor 304 is generally configured to perform the<br>
tasks and functions that support the operation of controller 300 as described<br>
herein. In this regard, the steps of a method or algorithm described in<br>
connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly<br>
in hardware, in firmware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in<br>
any practical combination thereof. A software module may reside in memory<br>
306, which may be realized as RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory,<br>
EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk,<br>
a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. In<br>
practice, memory 306 can be coupled to processor 304 such that processor 304<br>
can read information from, and write information to, memory 306. In the<br>
alternative, memory 306 may be integral to processor 304. As an example,<br>
processor 304 and memory 306 may reside in an ASIC.<br>
[0035] Signal generator 308, which is preferably configured as a PWM<br>
signal generator, cooperates with clock generator 310 in the manner described<br>
above to generate the gate drive signal sets for driving a plurality of gate<br>
drives corresponding to a plurality of inverters. Signal generator 308 may<br>
leverage known PWM techniques to generate the gate drive signal sets, and<br>
such known techniques will not be described in detail herein.<br>
[0036] Fault detection logic 312 is suitably configured to process fault<br>
status information received by controller 300, where such fault status<br><br>
information is generated by the gate drives to which controller 300 is coupled.<br>
During normal operation, the fault status information will indicate a healthy<br>
status for all inverters. If an inverter fails or suffers from degraded<br>
performance, then its corresponding gate drive can generate a suitable fault<br>
status indicator that informs controller 300 of the current state of the faulty<br>
inverter. Fault detection logic 312 (and/or processor 304) may process the<br>
fault status indicators to determine how best to proceed. For example, fault<br>
detection logic 312 may prompt the generation of new operating parameters<br>
for the remaining non-faulty inverters.<br>
[0037] A practical inverter system that employs the techniques described<br>
herein may utilize the example hardware implementation depicted in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of a portion of a multiple DC-to-AC<br>
inverter system 400 configured in accordance with an example embodiment of<br>
the invention. Inverter system 400 generally includes a controller 402, a first<br>
gate drive 404 for coupling to a first inverter (not shown), a fourth gate drive<br>
406 for coupling to a fourth inverter (not shown), and logical elements 408<br>
coupled between controller 402 and gate drives 404/406. For simplicity, FIG.<br>
4 does not show the equivalent structure for a second gate drive and a third<br>
gate drive. In a practical embodiment, logical elements 408 may be<br>
considered to be a part of controller 402, i.e., logical elements 408 may be<br>
realized on the same circuit card as controller 402.<br>
[0038] In the example implementation depicted in FIG. 4, the PWM<br>
signals to the parallel-coupled inverters are gated with a signal generated at the<br>
output of respective latches. In FIG. 4, if latch 410 is set (Set = "1"), its<br>
output is "0" which implies that the set of gates 412 are disabled and none of<br>
the PWM1 signals will reach first gate drive 404. If latch 410 is reset (Reset =<br>
"1"), its output is "1" and the PWM1 signals will control first gate drive 404.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 4, latch 410 is set if fourth gate drive 406 provides fault<br>
information to controller 402, e.g., fourth inverter 406 has faulted and has shut<br>
down. Following such a condition, first inverter 404 is rapidly shut down via<br>
latch 410 and gates 412, so an over-current situation can be prevented. Once<br><br>
controller 402 takes appropriate action to reduce performance demand, it will<br>
issue the signal Fault4ACK = "1" and latch 410 will be reset, allowing the<br>
healthy first inverter 404 to resume operation.<br>
[0039] The hardware implementation of FIG. 4 is desirable in practical<br>
deployments where controller 402 operates on a discrete time basis, called<br>
acquisition cycle, and checks the status of the fault input lines every 50 to 100<br>
microseconds, or possibly even slower. In this time interval, before controller<br>
402 detects a fault, the current in the healthy inverter can reach unacceptable<br>
values and eventually fault out. The use of faster, more advanced processors<br>
that could be interrupt-driven by the fault input lines could eliminate the need<br>
for the hardware logic part shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[0040] The operation of the redundancy handling system will be similar if<br>
first inverter 404 fails and fourth inverter 406 is healthy. The same applies for<br>
the parallel-coupled second and third inverters. By applying the techniques<br>
described herein, each time an inverter component of the quad-inverter fails,<br>
the motor continues to operate with 75% of the capability, rather than 50%<br>
capability as in conventional systems. The concept is also applicable to dual<br>
inverters in parallel, driving 3-phase motors. If one inverter fails, instead of<br>
losing the entire system, 50%) of the output capability can be quickly re-<br>
established after a very short shut-down period.<br>
[0041] FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an inverter system control process 500 for<br>
a multiple DC-to-AC inverter system configured in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment of the invention. The various tasks performed in<br>
connection with process 500 may be performed by software, hardware,<br>
firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following<br>
description of process 500 may refer to elements mentioned above in<br>
connection with FIGS. 1-4. In practical embodiments, portions of process 500<br>
may be performed by different elements of the described system, e.g., the<br>
controller. It should be appreciated that process 500 may include any number<br>
of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks shown in FIG. 5 need not be<br>
performed in the illustrated order, and process 500 may be incorporated into a<br><br>
more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not<br>
described in detail herein.<br>
[0042] Inverter system control process 500 begins with the detection of a<br>
fault status for a faulty inverter among the plurality of inverters in the system<br>
(query task 502). Upon the detection of a fault, process 500 may test for the<br>
existence of a fault in the partner inverter, i.e., the inverter coupled to and<br>
cooperating with the faulty inverter. If query task 504 determines that the<br>
partner inverter is also faulty, then both of the inverters will be disabled (task<br>
506). If the partner inverter is not faulty, then process 500 can disable the<br>
faulty inverter if necessary (task 508). In practice, process 500 may<br>
temporarily disable the healthy partner inverter for a short period while<br>
process 500 is completed.<br>
[0043] Process 500 can then proceed to recalculate the current references<br>
for reduced overall performance with the faulty inverter disabled and the<br>
healthy inverter enabled (task 510). During task 510, the controller may also<br>
recalculate electrical quantities that are dependent upon the current references,<br>
for example, the voltage feed-forward terms for the motor control algorithm.<br>
Generally, process 500 determines new operating parameters for the healthy<br>
inverter (task 512), including a calculation of updated load current<br>
requirements that account for the disabling of the faulty inverter.<br>
[0044] Once the new operating parameters have been determined, process<br>
500 can check if the current through the winding of the motor affected by the<br>
disabling of the faulty inverter has decreased to an acceptable level for single-<br>
inverter operation. In this regard, a query task 514 checks whether the motor<br>
current is less than or equal to the new current reference value. If not, then<br>
process 500 may be re-entered at query task 502 to re-calculate the operating<br>
parameters. If so, then process 500 causes the controller to generate updated<br>
gate drive signals for the non-faulty inverter and enable the non-faulty inverter<br>
to resume operation. Notably, the updated gate drive signal set will be<br>
influenced by the new operating parameters such that the non-faulty inverter is<br>
not driven to an over-current condition.<br><br>

of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
