				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR DESYNCHRONIZATION<br>
OF NEURAL BRAIN ACTIVITY<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for desynchronization of neural brain<br>
activity.<br>
In the case of patients with neurological or psychiatric illnesses, for<br>
example Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia or compulsion<br>
disorders, nerve cell groups in defined areas of the brain, for example the<br>
thalamus and the basal ganglia are active because of the illness, for<br>
example being excessively synchronous. In this case, a large number of<br>
neurons form synchronous action potentials; the neurons involved fire<br>
excessively synchronously. In healthy persons, in contrast, the neurons fire<br>
qualitatively differently in these brain regions, for example in an<br>
uncorrelated manner.<br>
In the case of Parkinson's disease, the pathologically synchronous activity,<br>
for example of the thalamus and of the basal ganglia, changes the neural<br>
activity in other brain regions, for example in areas of the cerebral cortex,<br>
such as the primary motor cortex. In this case, the pathologically<br>
synchronous activity in the area of the thalamus and of the basal ganglia<br>
forces itself, for example, on the rhythm of the cerebral cortex so that, in<br>
the end, the muscles which are controlled by these areas carry out a<br>
pathological activity, for example a rhythmic tremor.<br>
In the case of patients who cannot (can no longer) be treated with<br>
medicaments, a deep electrode is implanted on one side or both sides<br>
depending on the clinical signs and depending on whether the illness<br>
occurs on one side or both sides. In this case, a cable leads under the skin<br>
from the head to the so-called generator, which comprises a controller with<br>
a battery and, for example, is implanted under the skin in the area of the<br>
clavicle. The deep electrodes are used to carry out a continuous stimulus<br>

AN APPARATUS FOR DESYNCHRONIATION<br>
OF NEURAL BRAIN ACTIVITY<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for desynchronization of neural brain<br>
activity.<br>
In the case of patients with neurological or psychiatric illnesses, for<br>
example Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia or compulsion<br>
disorders, nerve cell groups in defined areas of the brain, for example the<br>
thalamus and the basal ganglia are active because of the illness, for<br>
example being excessively synchronous. In this case, a large number of<br>
neurons form synchronous action potentials; the neurons involved fire<br>
excessively synchronously. In healthy persons, in contrast, the neurons fire<br>
qualitatively differently in these brain regions, for example in an<br>
uncorrelated manner.<br>
In the case of Parkinson's disease, the pathologically synchronous activity,<br>
for example of the thalamus and of the basal ganglia, changes the neural<br>
activity in other brain regions, for example in areas of the cerebral cortex,<br>
such as the primary motor cortex. In this case, the pathologically<br>
synchronous activity in the area of the thalamus and of the basal ganglia<br>
forces itself, for example, on the rhythm of the cerebral cortex so that, in<br>
the end, the muscles which are controlled by these areas carry out a<br>
pathological activity, for example a rhythmic tremor.<br>
In the case of patients who cannot (can no longer) be treated with<br>
medicaments, a deep electrode is implanted on one side or both sides<br>
depending on the clinical signs and depending on whether the illness<br>
occurs on one side or both sides. In this case, a cable leads under the skin<br>
from the head to the so-called generator, which comprises a controller with<br>
a battery and, for example, is implanted under the skin in the area of the<br>
clavicle. The deep electrodes are used to carry out a continuous stimulus<br>
with a high-frequency periodic sequence (pulse train at a frequency of<br><br><br>
&gt; 100 Hz) of individual pulses, for example square-wave pulses. The aim of<br>
this method is to suppress the firing of the neurons in the target regions.<br>
The effective mechanism on which the standard deep stimulation is based<br>
has not yet been adequately explained. The results of a number of studies<br>
indicate that standard deep stimulation acts in the same way as reversible<br>
lesion formation, that is to say in the same way as reversible deactivation<br>
of the tissue: standard deep stimulation suppresses the firing of the<br>
neurons in the target regions and/or in brain areas linked thereto.<br>
This type of stimulation has the disadvantage that the power consumption<br>
of the generator is very high, so that the generator including the battery<br>
frequently has to be replaced operatively after only about one to three<br>
years. It is even more disadvantageous that the high-frequency continuous<br>
stimulation, as a non-physiological (unnatural) input in the area of the brain,<br>
for example of the thalamus or of the basal ganglia, can lead to adaptation<br>
of the relevant nerve cell groups over the course of a few years. In order to<br>
achieve the same stimulation success, a greater stimulus amplitude must<br>
then be used for stimulation, as a consequence of this adaptation. The<br>
greater the stimulus amplitude is, the greater is the probability that the<br>
stimulation of adjacent areas will lead to side-effects - such as dysarthria<br>
(speech disturbances), dysesthesia (in some cases highly painful false<br>
sensations), cerebellary ataxia (incapability to stand safely without an<br>
external aid), or symptoms similar to schizophrenia, etc. These side-effects<br>
cannot be tolerated by the patient. In these situations, the treatment thus<br>
loses its effectiveness after a few years.<br>
In the case of other stimulation methods, such as those described in<br>
DE 10211 766.7 "Vorrichtung zur Behandlung von Patienten mittels<br>
Hirnstimulation, ein elektronisches Bauteil sowie die Verwendung der<br>
Vorrichtung und des elektronischen Bauteils in der Medizin" [Apparatus for<br>
the treatment of patients by means of brain stimulation, an electronic<br>
component as well as the use of the apparatus and of the electronic<br>
component in medicine] and in DE 103 18 071.0-33 "Vorrichtung zur<br>
Desynchronisation von neuronaler Hirnaktivitat" [Apparatus for<br><br><br>
desynchronization of neural brain activity], it has been proposed that stimuli<br>
be applied in the respective target region on a demand-controlled basis.<br>
The aim of these methods/these apparatuses is not simply to suppress the<br>
illness-synchronous firing - as in the case of standard deep stimulation -<br>
but to change this to be closer to the physiological, uncorrelated firing<br>
pattern. The aims of this are on the one hand to reduce the power<br>
consumption and on the other hand to use the demand-controlled<br>
stimulation to reduce the amount of energy introduced into the tissue in<br>
comparison to the standard deep stimulation. These demand-controlled,<br>
desynchronizing methods also have relevant disadvantages, however.<br>
The disadvantages of the demand-controlled, desynchronizing stimulation<br>
methods according to DE 102 11 766.7 result from the following fact: in<br>
order to desynchronize a synchronized nerve cell group with an electrical<br>
stimulus, an electrical stimulus of specific duration must be administered in<br>
the target area precisely with respect to the specific phase of the illness-<br>
related rhythmic activity. Since such precision cannot yet be reliably<br>
achieved experimentally at the moment, composed stimuli are used. The<br>
first stimulus of a composed stimulus such as this controls the dynamics of<br>
the population to be desynchronized by means of a reset, that is to say a<br>
restart, while the second stimulus in the composed stimulus strikes the<br>
nerve cell group in a vulnerable state, and desynchronizes it. However, it is<br>
essential for this purpose that the quality of the monitoring, that is to say<br>
the quality of the reset, is adequate, which in some circumstances may<br>
mean that a major stimulus must be used for the reset. However, this<br>
should be avoided in the sense of reducing the side-effects. However, it is<br>
even more critical that the desired desynchronizing effect occurs only when<br>
the stimulation parameters, that is to say the duration of the individual<br>
stimuli and in particular the pause between the first and the second<br>
stimulus, are optimally chosen. This has serious consequences:<br>
1.	A time-consuming calibration procedure is required, and<br>
typically lasts for more than 30 minutes.<br>
2.	Because of the time-consuming calibration procedure, the<br><br><br>
effect of the desynchronizing stimulation according to<br>
DE 102 11 766.7 cannot be used for intra-operative selection of<br>
the most suitable target point for the deep electrode. The effect<br>
of the desynchronizing stimulation according to<br>
DE 10211 766.7 would have to be tested separately for<br>
different target points for this purpose, which would require a<br>
separate calibration for each target point; this would lengthen<br>
the duration of electrode implantation in a manner that is<br>
unacceptable to the patient.<br>
3.	When relatively major fluctuations occur in the network<br>
characteristics, that is to say fluctuations in the parameters<br>
which describe the activity of the nerve cell population, such as<br>
synaptic strengths and firing rates, recalibration must be carried<br>
out. This has the disadvantage that no therapeutic effect can be<br>
achieved during the calibration.<br>
4.	Since the desynchronizing stimulation according to<br>
DE 102 11 766.7 occurs only when the frequency of the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized is not subject to relatively<br>
major fluctuations, it cannot be used for illnesses with epochs<br>
which occur for a short time of synchronous activity that is<br>
excessive by virtue of the illness, at a highly varying frequency,<br>
that is to say for example in the case of epilepsies.<br>
Disadvantages of the demand-controlled, desynchronizing stimulation<br>
methods according to DE 103 18 071.0-33 result from the following fact: in<br>
order to desynchronize a synchronized nerve cell group by means of an<br>
electrical stimulus, a multiple electrode stimulation is carried out. A high-<br>
frequency pulse train or a low-frequency pulse train of short duration is<br>
applied to the individual electrodes. This leads to a phase reset of the<br>
stimulated neuron population. The times at which stimulation is applied via<br>
the various electrodes are chosen such that there is an equidistant phase<br>
shift between the neural sub-populations associated with the stimulation<br>
electrodes. After the completion of a stimulus such as this which is<br>
administered via a plurality of electrodes the pathologically increased<br><br><br>
interaction between the neurons automatically results in complete<br>
desynchronization.<br>
This method has the advantage of rapid calibration and robustness to<br>
fluctuations in the parameters, so that this stimulation method can also be<br>
used in situations in which epochs which only occur for a short time of<br>
synchronous activity at a highly varying frequency. However, the method in<br>
DE 103 18 071.0-33 also has serious disadvantages:<br>
1.	In order to produce a complete and uniform phase reset in<br>
the relevant neuron population, a very strong stimulus must be<br>
applied to the respective electrodes. The uniform phase shift is<br>
necessary since the pathological interaction can lead to<br>
complete desynchronization only with an equidistant phase<br>
reset. The use of very strong stimuli should, however, be<br>
avoided in order to reduce side effects.<br>
2.	One major feature of the method registered in<br>
DE 10318 071.0-33 is the recurrent, possibly demand-<br>
controlled, application of an overall stimulus. The stimulated<br>
tissue is resynchronized between the overall stimuli. This means<br>
that the nerve population to be desynchronized oscillates<br>
between two unphysiological states: an N-cluster state, where N<br>
represents the number of electrodes used for stimulation, and a<br>
transient state of resynchronization. The population to be<br>
desynchronized is therefore never in the desired state of<br>
desynchronization for a lengthy time, although this is what is to<br>
be aimed for in order to reduce the illness-dependent symptoms<br>
and the stimulation-dependent side-effects.<br>
3.	The demand controller registered in DE 103 18 071.0-33<br>
requires a complex controller, which has complicated control<br>
electronics and necessarily a greater power consumption.<br>
The stimulation methods mentioned above use individual pulses, high-<br>
frequency pulse trains and low-frequency pulse trains as stimulation<br><br><br>
signals, which either suppress the dedicated dynamics of the stimulated<br>
neurons or change the neuron population to be desynchronized to an N-<br>
cluster state by means of a phase reset. The stimulation pulse trains are<br>
constructed without using the dedicated dynamics of the neuron population<br>
to be desynchronized and, in this sense, are external and unphysiological<br>
signals for the neuron population to be desynchronized. In order to<br>
suppress the illness symptoms, the stimulation pulse trains would have to<br>
be applied with a high intensity, which leads to the expectation that the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized would adapt itself to the<br>
unphysiological stimuli, and possible side-effects.<br>
The subject matter of the invention is thus to provide an apparatus for<br>
desynchronization of neural brain activity, by means of which patients with<br>
illness-synchronized brain activity can be treated mildly and efficiently. One<br>
aim in this case is to suppress adaptation to an unphysiological continuous<br>
stimulus. Tedious calibration processes should be avoided, and the<br>
stimulation should also be successful even when the main-frequency<br>
component of the pathologically rhythmic activity is subject to major<br>
fluctuations. Furthermore, the apparatus is intended to achieve long-term<br>
desynchronization, while very largely avoiding transient, stimulation-<br>
dependent unphysiological states. The apparatus according to the<br>
invention does not require any additional demand controller, which may be<br>
added optionally as described in Section 6.3, so that it can be implemented<br>
easily and only minor demands are placed on the complexity of the control<br>
electronics, and thus on the power consumption as well. The stimulation<br>
apparatus according to the invention is intended to operate in a power-<br>
saving manner, so that the batteries of the stimulator which is implanted in<br>
the patient need not be operatively replaced as often.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for<br>
desynchronization of neural brain activity, having at least one sensor for<br>
measurement of a signal which reproduces the time development of the<br>
activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized, as well at least two<br>
electrodes, characterized by a controller which is designed in such a<br><br><br>
manner that it records the measurement signal from the sensor (3) and<br>
feeds the measurement signal as a stimulation signal or the measurement<br>
signal, once it has been processed, as a stimulation signal into each of the<br>
at least two electrodes .<br>
Against the background of the precharacterizing clause of claim 1, the<br>
object is achieved according to the invention by means of the features<br>
specified in the characterizing part of claim 1. Using the measured and<br>
processed activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized as a<br>
feedback stimulation signal, see Section 3, the object is achieved of the<br>
neurons in at least two subareas of a brain area or at least two functionally<br>
associated brain areas each having their activity influenced by the use of at<br>
least two electrodes for stimulation with individual stimuli with different time<br>
delays, in such a way that this surprisingly results in complete<br>
desynchronization of the stimulated neuron population, thus suppressing<br>
the symptoms in a person with an illness. For this purpose, the apparatus<br>
according to the invention has a controller 4 which records the<br>
measurement signal from the sensor 3 or the sensors 3, generates at least<br>
two stimulation signals from this signal, and passes them to the electrodes<br>
2.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention operates in a power-saving<br>
manner, so that batteries that have been implanted in the patient may be<br>
replaced less often.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention makes it possible to use the<br>
effect, achieved intraoperatively by the desynchronizing stimulation, for<br>
selection of the most suitable target point for the deep electrode. For this<br>
purpose, a test stimulus is carried out in advance in millimetric steps using<br>
the apparatus according to the invention in the area of the target point as<br>
calculated anatomically in advance, during the implantation of the deep<br>
electrode. The target point at which the best therapeutic effect can be<br>
achieved is chosen as the target point for the long-term implantation.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the illnesses which have been mentioned above<br><br><br>
and which frequently have long-lasting pathologically synchronous activity<br>
at a relatively constant frequency, illnesses can also be treated in which<br>
pathologically synchronous activity occurs only intermittently (occurring for<br>
a short time). One major indication in this case is the treatment of epileptics<br>
who cannot (can no longer) be treated with medicaments. For example, the<br>
apparatus according to the invention can be used to achieve<br>
desynchronization in the illnesses of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor,<br>
dystonia, epilepsy and compulsive disorders.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are specified in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The accompanying drawings show exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an apparatus according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2a shows the waveform of the synchronization measure during one<br>
stimulation interval. Low (high) values correspond to low (high)<br>
synchronization. The stimulation starts at the time 2 seconds and is ended<br>
at the time 25 seconds.<br>
Figure 2b shows the waveform of the neural activity of the nerve cells<br>
measured using the sensor 3 during the stimulation in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2c shows the waveform of the individual stimulus applied via an<br>
electrode 2 during the stimulation in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of one application of a stimulation pattern via 4<br>
electrodes with four different time delays.<br>
Figure 4 shows an example of a stimulus application using 4 electrodes<br>
and two different time delays, and different polarity.<br><br><br>
In Figures 2a, b and c, the abscissas denote the time axes in seconds,<br>
while the synchronization measure (Figure 2a), the measured neural<br>
activity (Figure 2b) and an example of a single stimulus (Figure 2c) are<br>
plotted, in each case in arbitrary units, on the ordinates. The neural activity<br>
(Figure 2b) measured by means of the sensor 3 is used as the basis for<br>
creation of the individual stimuli. The neural activity (Figure 2b) measured<br>
using the sensor 3 is used as a control signal for the stimulus application.<br>
In Figure 3, the abscissa is the time axis in seconds, while the measured<br>
neural activity and the individual stimuli, for example in the sense of the<br>
applied current, are illustrated, in each case in arbitrary units, on the<br>
ordinate. The same stimulation pattern with the same polarity is applied via<br>
the four electrodes 2, but with four different, for example equidistant, time<br>
delays.<br>
In Figure 4, the abscissa is the time axis in seconds, while the measured<br>
neural activity and the individual stimuli, for example in the sense of the<br>
applied current, are illustrated, in each case in arbitrary units, on the<br>
ordinate. The polarity of the individual stimuli can also be varied, as an<br>
alternative to variation of the time delays. For example, a stimulation<br>
stimulus with the same time delay but with different polarity can be applied<br>
via the first two electrodes 2. In a corresponding manner, a stimulation<br>
stimulus with a different time delay but with a different polarity is applied via<br>
the third and fourth electrodes 2. The respective polarity of the individual<br>
stimuli is indicated by the symbols"+" and "-".<br>
The apparatus shown in Figure 1 comprises an isolation amplifier 1 to<br>
which at least two electrodes 2 as well as at least one sensor 3 are<br>
connected in order to detect physiological measurement signals. The<br>
isolation amplifier is also connected to a unit 4 for signal processing and<br>
control, which is connected to an optical transmitter for the stimulation 5.<br>
The optical transmitter 5 is connected via optical waveguides 6 to an<br>
optical receiver 7, which is connected to a stimulator unit 8 for signal<br>
production. The stimulator unit 8 for signal production is connected to at<br><br><br>
least two electrodes 2. A relay 9 or a transistor is located in the input area<br>
of the electrodes 2 into the isolation amplifier 1. The unit 4 is connected via<br>
a line 10 to a telemetry transmitter 11, which is connected to a telemetry<br>
receiver 12 which is located outside the appliance to be implanted and to<br>
which a means for visualization, processing and storage of the data 13 is<br>
connected. By way of example, epicortical electrodes, deep electrodes,<br>
brain electrodes or peripheral electrodes may be used as sensors 3.<br>
The electrodes 2 each comprise at least two wires, to whose ends a<br>
potential difference is applied for stimulation purposes. These may be<br>
macro-electrodes or micro-electrodes. Alternatively, the electrodes 2 may<br>
also each be individual wires. In this case, a potential difference is in each<br>
case applied for stimulation purposes between an individual wire and the<br>
metallic part of the housing of the generator. In addition, but not<br>
necessarily, a potential difference can be measured across the electrodes<br>
2 in order to detect pathological activity. In a further embodiment, the<br>
electrodes 2 may also comprise more than two individual wires, which can<br>
be used both for the determination of a measurement signal in the brain<br>
and for stimulation purposes. By way of example, four wires may be<br>
accommodated in one conductor cable, in which case a potential difference<br>
can be applied or measured between different ends. This makes it possible<br>
to vary the magnitude of the derived or stimulated target region. The<br>
number of wires from which the electrode is formed is limited in the upward<br>
direction only by the thickness associated with it of the cable to be inserted<br>
into the brain, with the aim of damaging as little brain material as possible.<br>
Commercially available electrodes comprise four wires, although the<br>
electrodes may also have five, six or more wires, or else only three wires.<br>
In a situation where the electrodes 2 comprise more than two wires, at<br>
least one of these wires may also act as a sensor 3, so that this results in<br>
an embodiment in which the electrodes 2 and the sensor 3 are combined in<br>
a single component. The wires of the electrodes 2 may have different<br>
lengths, so that they can penetrate to different brain depths. If the<br>
electrodes 2 comprise n wires, where n is an integer, then stimulation can<br><br><br>
be carried out via at least one pair of wires, in which case any sub-<br>
combination of wires is possible in order to form pairs. In addition to this<br>
component, it is also possible to provide sensors 3 which are not physically<br>
combined with the electrodes 2.<br>
By way of example and in plain words, the apparatus according to the<br>
invention is used, in a first step, to measure the neural activity by means of<br>
the sensors. In a second step, the stimulation signals are generated by<br>
means of a time delay and if required by means of further processing of the<br>
neural activity. These stimulation signals are then used via at least two<br>
implanted electrodes for stimulation, preferably with different time delays, in<br>
a third process step. This stimulation results in desynchronization in the<br>
stimulated tissue. Details of the method of operation of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention are explained in Section 1.<br>
As described in Section 6, the apparatus according to the invention can be<br>
implemented in various embodiments of the time control for stimulus<br>
application. The variants of time control for stimulus application are<br>
permanent, repetitive and demand-controlled stimulus application.<br>
The permanent stimulus application according to the invention is one<br>
simple embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention which<br>
operates without any additional demand control and applies stimuli<br>
permanently, as described in Section 6.1. Permanent stimulus application<br>
therefore represents an embodiment of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention which can be implemented easily. At the same time, the self-<br>
regulating demand control according to the invention as described in<br>
Section 5 provides a good desynchronizing effect of permanent stimulation<br>
with little energy being introduced into the target population.<br>
In the case of the repetitive stimulus application according to the invention,<br>
the apparatus according to the invention has a controller which is<br>
programmed such that it applies the stimulation signals to the electrodes 2<br>
only during specific time intervals. There is no stimulation outside these<br><br><br>
time intervals. The control unit 4 is thus programmed such that, in the<br>
embodiment of the repetitive stimulation as described in Section 6.2 a<br>
stimulation signal which is generated with a duration that is calculated by<br>
the control unit 4 is generated at times which preferably follow one another<br>
periodically and are determined by the control unit 4, with this stimulation<br>
signal being emitted to the electrodes 2. As in the case of permanent<br>
stimulus application, self-regulating demand control of the amplitude of the<br>
stimulation signal also takes place in repetitive stimulus application.<br>
In the case of the demand-controlled stimulus application according to the<br>
invention, the apparatus according to the invention has an additional<br>
demand controller. For this purpose, the apparatus according to the<br>
invention is preferably equipped with means which identify the signals of<br>
the electrodes 2 and/or of the sensors 3 as pathological and, when a<br>
pathological pattern is present, emit stimuli via the electrodes 2 which<br>
result in the pathological neural activity in the sub-populations that are<br>
stimulated by the individual electrodes 2 being desynchronized, and thus<br>
coming closer to the natural, physiological activity. The pathological activity<br>
differs from the healthy activity by a characteristic change in its pattern<br>
and/or its amplitude and/or its frequency content. The means for<br>
identification of the pathological pattern are in this case a computer, which<br>
processes the measured signals from the electrodes 2 and/or from the<br>
sensor 3 and compares them with data stored in the computer. The<br>
computer has a data storage medium which stores data and can be used in<br>
accordance with Sections 6 and 7 for calibration and/or control purposes.<br>
For example, the control unit 4 may comprise a chip or some other<br>
electronic apparatus with comparable computation power.<br>
Depending on the occurrence and the extent of pathological features in the<br>
processed neural activity, a stimulus signal is emitted to the electrodes 2 in<br>
the embodiment of the demand-controlled stimulus application as<br>
described in Section 6.3, thus resulting in stimulation of the brain tissue.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention has means for identification of the<br>
occurrence and/or of the extent of the pathological features in the neural<br><br><br>
activity as measured by means of the sensor 3. The control unit 4 is<br>
programmed such that, in the embodiment of the demand-controlled<br>
stimulus application as described in Section 6.3, a stimulation signal is<br>
generated at a time defined by the control unit 4, and is emitted to the<br>
electrodes 2. Overall, the aim is to store all of those parameters that are<br>
relevant for the respective procedure for the apparatus according to the<br>
invention, relating to the nature and intensity of the stimuli, together with<br>
their time delays as well as information relating to the electrode-specific<br>
application, as well as those measured values which are relevant for the<br>
demand-controlled methods of operation and have been determined by<br>
means of the sensor 3, or parameters derived from them.<br>
The control unit 4 preferably drives the electrodes 2 in the following<br>
manner: the control data is passed on from the control unit 4 to an optical<br>
transmitter for stimulation 5, which drives the optical receiver 7 via the<br>
optical fiber 6. Optical injection of the control signals into the optical<br>
receiver 7 provides DC isolation between the stimulation controller and the<br>
electrodes 2. This means that this prevents interference signals from the<br>
unit for signal processing and the controller 4 from being injected into the<br>
electrodes 2. By way of example, a photocell may be used as the optical<br>
receiver 7. The optical receiver 7 passes on to the stimulator unit 8 the<br>
signals which are input for the stimulation 5 via the optical transmitter.<br>
Specific stimuli are then passed on via the stimulator unit 8 and via the<br>
electrodes 2 to the target region in the brain. In the situation where the<br>
electrodes 2 are also used for measurement purposes, a relay 9 is also<br>
driven from the optical transmitter for stimulation 5 via the optical receiver<br>
7, thus preventing the injection of interference signals. The relay 9 or the<br>
transistor ensures that the neural activity can be measured again<br>
immediately after each stimulus, without overdriving the isolation amplifier.<br>
The DC isolation need not necessarily be provided by optical injection of<br>
the control signals and, in fact, other alternative control processes can also<br>
be used. These may, for example, be acoustic inputs, for example in the<br>
ultrasound band. Interference-free control can also be achieved, for<br>
example, with the assistance of suitable analog or digital filters.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the apparatus according to the invention is preferably<br>
connected to means for visualization and processing of the signals, and for<br>
data back-up 13, via the telemetry receiver 12. In this case, the unit 13 may<br>
comprise the methods mentioned in the following text for data analysis.<br>
Furthermore, the apparatus according to the invention may be connected<br>
via the telemetry receiver 13 to an additional reference database in order,<br>
for example, to monitor correct operation of the appliance and, possibly, to<br>
design the control mechanisms as described in Section 7.2 to be more<br>
efficient, by modification of the parameters.<br>
The stimulation mechanism is explained in detail in Section 1. Section 2<br>
contains a definition of the most important terms. The process steps for<br>
measurement of the neural activity via their processing as far as the<br>
generation of the overall stimuli is explained in Section 3. The physical<br>
arrangement of the electrodes and sensors is the subject matter of<br>
Section 4. Section 5 deals with the self-regulating demand control of the<br>
stimulation amplitude. The control of the stimulus application and the<br>
calibration and adaptation of the stimulation parameters are described in<br>
Sections 6 and 7. The advantages of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention are described in Section 8.<br>
1 Stimulation mechanism<br>
The aim of the stimulation is to counteract illness-dependent<br>
synchronization in a nerve cell population, by desynchronization. This is<br>
done by applying stimuli at at least two points, which stimuli are generated<br>
by measuring the neural activity, by converting this to a stimulation signal<br>
on the basis of a processing step which may be provided, and by<br>
application, preferably with a time delay, so that, surprisingly, this results in<br>
desynchronization. The desynchronizing effect of the stimulation is assisted<br>
by the illness-dependent interaction between the neurons and the decrease<br>
in the stimulation effect with the distance between the stimulated tissue and<br><br><br>
the electrode. In plain words, the energy of the system to be influenced is<br>
utilized in order to achieve a therapeutic effect with minimal intervention.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention changes the nerve cell population<br>
to be desynchronized directly to a desynchronized state. The desired state,<br>
that is to say complete desynchronization, typically occurs within a few<br>
periods of the neural activity, frequently in less than one period.<br>
There is typically a need for permanent or repetitive stimulation, since the<br>
nerve cell population to be desynchronized becomes resynchronized again,<br>
from experience, once the stimulation is switched off. Since the stimulation<br>
is directly related to the neural activity of the target area, or of an<br>
associated area, the stimulation amplitude is automatically minimized after<br>
successful desynchronization. This is made possible by using the feedback<br>
stimulation signal, that is to say the processed neural activity, as the<br>
stimulation stimulus, that is to say the extent of synchronization<br>
permanently controls the intensity of the stimulation. This process works for<br>
a wide range of stimulating parameters which can be modified, such as the<br>
stimulation period T, the time delay and the intensity, does not require any<br>
complex calibration, and has a high degree of tolerance to faults and<br>
errors. Furthermore, the amount of energy which is introduced into the<br>
tissue to be desynchronized is minimized because of the direct relationship<br>
between neural activity and the stimulation pattern, thus leading to the<br>
expectation of reduced side-effects.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention and its operation will be<br>
explained using examples in the following text.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention and the controller are equipped<br>
with means which can carry out all of the steps of the treatment process<br>
according to the invention. The disclosed method steps are thus also<br>
intended to implicitly disclose means for carrying out the method step. The<br>
method steps thus also at the same time represent the functionalized<br>
apparatus features.<br><br><br>
According to the invention, the electrodes are introduced into the brain<br>
region which is responsible for the creation of the clinical signs. According<br>
to the invention, at least two or preferably four or else three or more<br>
electrodes are introduced either directly into the region or into one or more<br>
nerve cell populations or nerve fiber groups which are linked to this region.<br>
The number of electrodes is restricted only by the need to ensure that there<br>
is not an unrestricted density of electrodes in one brain region, in order that<br>
the tissue is not unnecessarily damaged and, in particular, to reduce the<br>
risk of bleeding on insertion of the electrodes. In any case, the number of<br>
electrodes introduced into the region should be N, where N&gt; 2.<br>
In this case, each electrode emits a signal in its surrounding area, which,<br>
while propagating either directly in its surrounding area or via a nerve fiber<br>
group, results in desynchronization in a different area. In order to achieve<br>
desynchronization, the measured and processed neural activity is used as<br>
a stimulation stimulus, in each case with a time delay, see Section 3. The<br>
apparatus according to the invention thus has a controller which drives at<br>
least two electrodes 2 such that they produce desynchronization in the<br>
area relatively closely surrounding them and/or by passing on the<br>
stimulation via a fiber group in another brain area.<br>
According to the invention, N electrodes, where N&gt; 2, are preferably driven<br>
such that there is a time delay of T/N between the individual electrode<br>
signals, assuming that the stimulating electrodes 2 are in the area to be<br>
desynchronized. In this case, as described below, T is the period of the<br>
rhythmic neural activity to be desynchronized. If at least one of the<br>
stimulating electrodes 2 is not located in the area to be desynchronized,<br>
the delay time between the stimulus location and the location of the neuron<br>
population which is influenced in this way must be taken into account in the<br>
drive for an electrode 2 such as this. This is described in Section 7.3. The<br>
apparatus according to the invention accordingly has a controller which, in<br>
the case of N electrodes, preferably produces a stimulation signal which is<br>
shifted in time through essentially one A/-th of the period of the activity to be<br>
desynchronized. The time shift is in this case preferably essentially<br><br><br>
equidistant.<br>
Surprisingly, in the case of this equidistant time shift of the neuron<br>
populations which are each influenced by the N electrodes 2 this does not<br>
simply result in the neuron population being subdivided into N sub-<br>
populations which are each synchronized in their own right. In fact, this<br>
stimulation surprisingly leads to desynchronization of the entire neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized, thus leading to suppression of the<br>
pathological symptoms. If at least one electrode 2 is located outside the<br>
area to be desynchronized, then the effects of the indirect stimulation must<br>
be taken into account, as described in Section 7.3.<br>
The new method and the new apparatus result in the desynchronization<br>
being achieved in a qualitatively different manner to that in the prior art<br>
cited above. Instead of acting specifically on the illness-synchronous nerve<br>
cell group in a vulnerable phase of its rhythm, the relevant nerve cell group<br>
is simply stimulated on a time-coordinated basis at a plurality of locations,<br>
see Section 3.3, in such a manner that desynchronization occurs. The<br>
neural activity process as described in Section 3.2 at the individual stimulus<br>
locations is used for this purpose. Stimulation must be applied to at least<br>
two, and preferably more than two, stimulus locations. The<br>
desynchronization that surprisingly occurs is assisted by the interaction,<br>
which is increased by the illness, between the neurons and by the<br>
stimulation effect which decreases with the distance between the<br>
stimulation location and the neuron to be stimulated. In this case, use is<br>
made of an effect mechanism which is responsible for the illness-related<br>
synchronization. In plain words, the energy of the system to be influenced<br>
is utilized in order to achieve a therapeutic effect with minimal intervention.<br>
The best results are achieved when overall stimuli with essentially<br>
equidistant time delays are used. However, treatment successes are also<br>
achieved when the time delays between the stimuli emitted via the<br>
electrodes 2 are not equidistant. In a case such as this, at least partial<br>
desynchronization is achieved. The treatment results become better the<br>
closer the chosen time delays become to equidistant time delays.<br><br><br>
2 Definition of terms<br>
Target population:<br>
In the following text, the expression target population means the nerve cell<br>
population which is directly stimulated by an implanted stimulation<br>
electrode.<br>
A target population is stimulated directly by means of an electrode which is<br>
implanted in it or close to it.<br>
The nerve cell population which is synchronously active as a result of the<br>
illness is referred to as the area to be desynchronized, as the nerve cell<br>
population to be desynchronized, or as the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. The area to be desynchronized is not associated with<br>
anatomical boundaries. In fact, this can also be understood as meaning at<br>
least one component, comprising the following group:<br>
at least a part of at least one anatomical area,<br>
at least one complete anatomical area.<br>
The area to be desynchronized may be stimulated either directly or<br>
indirectly.<br>
Direct stimulation:<br>
In this case, the stimulation electrode 2 is located directly in the area to be<br>
desynchronized.<br>
This electrode 2 in this case influences the target population which is<br>
located in the area to be desynchronized.<br>
Indirect stimulation:<br>
In this case, the area to be desynchronized is not stimulated directly by<br>
means of the stimulation electrode 2. In fact, a target position or a fiber<br><br><br>
group which is functionally closely linked to the area to be desynchronized<br>
is stimulated via the electrode 2. In this case, the stimulation effect<br>
preferably propagates to the area to be desynchronized via anatomical<br>
links. The expression target area is introduced as a generic term for the<br>
target population and the fiber group, for indirect stimulation. In the<br>
following text, the expression target area should be understood as the<br>
neuron population, which is functionally closely linked to the area to be<br>
desynchronized, and the connecting fiber group, which are directly<br>
stimulated by implanted electrodes 2.<br>
Neural activity:<br>
The description of the mechanism of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention is based essentially on the term neural activity. The neural activity<br>
of the neuron population to be desynchronized and/or of a neuron<br>
population which is closely linked to it is measured, stored, and processed<br>
in accordance with Section 3.2, and is used as a stimulation signal, thus<br>
providing the self-regulating demand control according to the invention. In<br>
the following text, the expression the measured neural activity of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized means a signal which reproduces<br>
the time development of the activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. By way of example, local field potentials can reproduce<br>
the time development of the activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. The neural activity can preferably be measured directly in<br>
the area to be desynchronized, although it is also possible to measure an<br>
activity which is associated with the neural activity of the area to be<br>
desynchronized, for example a different brain area, in this case by way of<br>
example the motor cortex, or the activity of a muscle group which is<br>
controlled by the area to be desynchronized. In a further embodiment of the<br>
apparatus according to the invention, neural activities are measured at<br>
different locations and are combined in order to obtain an adequate<br>
representation of the neural activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. These variables which are associated with the neural<br>
activity of the area to be desynchronized are also referred to as neural<br>
activity in the following text.<br><br><br>
Feedback stimulation signal:<br>
The expression feedback stimulation signal means that signal which,<br>
according to Section 3.2, represents the measured and processed neural<br>
activity and is used as the basis for the individual stimuli.<br>
Rhythm:<br>
The expression rhythm is used to mean the rhythmic, that is to say<br>
approximately periodic, neural activity which results from nerve cell activity<br>
that is excessively synchronous because of an illness. A rhythm can occur<br>
briefly or on a long-lasting basis.<br>
Period:<br>
One central term for the apparatus according to the invention is the period<br>
of the rhythmic neural activity, and this is used as a time reference for the<br>
application of the individual stimuli. Adaptation of the stimulation T, as<br>
described in Section 7.2.1, preferably results in the period of the rhythmic<br>
neural activity matching the stimulation period T.<br>
Time delay:<br>
The apparatus according to the invention causes signals to be passed to<br>
the stimulation electrode 2 which correspond to the neural activity, as<br>
measured in accordance with Section 3.1 and possibly processed, relating<br>
to an earlier time. This time shift is referred to in the following text as the<br>
time delay and represents one important stimulation parameter, which is<br>
related to the period of the rhythmic neural activity.<br>
Individual stimulus:<br>
The expression an individual stimulus, see Section 3.3, in the following text<br>
means a stimulation stimulus which is applied via a single electrode and<br>
acts over a time interval. The neural activity processed in accordance with<br>
Section 3.2 is used for these stimulation stimuli.<br>
Overall stimulus:<br><br><br>
An overall stimulus is the totality of the individual stimuli applied via the<br>
electrodes, see Section 3.4.<br>
3 Nature of the stimulation stimulus<br>
3.1 Measurement of the neural activity<br>
The time profile of the neural activity of the area to be desynchronized can<br>
be measured directly or indirectly by means of the sensors 3.<br>
The sensors 3 (see Figure 1) are located in the brain and/or outside the<br>
brain. In the brain, they are positioned in the area to be desynchronized<br>
and/or in at least one other area which is functionally linked to it. Outside<br>
the brain, the sensors 3 are located at body parts which are linked to the<br>
neural activity that is synchronized because of the illness, for example as<br>
electrodes on a trambling muscle. The measurement signals of the neural<br>
and/or non-neural, for example muscular, activity are processed in a unit<br>
for signal processing 4, and are stored. In this case, these measurement<br>
signals can be processed and stored permanently and/or at discrete time<br>
intervals. In the latter case, the duration and/or the intervals between the<br>
discrete measurement intervals are/is determined by means of a<br>
deterministic and/or stochastic algorithm.<br>
3.2 Processing of the neural measurement signals<br>
The measurement signals which are stored in the unit for signal processing<br>
4 are then processed in order to be made available as stimulation signals.<br>
The following processing steps may be carried out:<br>
1. The measured neural activity may be filtered, for example<br>
bandpass filtering may be carried out on the neural activity. The<br>
filtering may be necessary when activity which is not yet illness-<br>
specific, for example from other neuron populations, is<br>
additionally measured in addition to the illness-specific activity<br>
by means of the sensor 3. Since the illness-specific activity<br><br><br>
typically occurs in a frequency range which differs from the<br>
frequency range of non-illness-specific activity, the activity in the<br>
illness-specific frequency range is preferably determined in this<br>
case. This is done, for example, by means of a frequency<br>
analysis. It may likewise be necessary to carry out a wavelet<br>
analysis and/or a Hilbert transformation and/or filtering in the<br>
time domain.<br>
2.	When the neural activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized is measured by means of a plurality of sensors<br>
3,	then a linear and/or non-linear combination and/or<br>
transformation can be carried out, for example multiplication,<br>
addition or calculation of a function, of the measured neural<br>
activity.<br>
3.	The measured neural activity is delayed in time. The time<br>
delays which are used for this purpose are defined in<br>
Sections 3.3 and 3.4 and also, in accordance with Section 7.3,<br>
take account of the position of the stimulation electrodes with<br>
respect to the neuron population to be desynchronized.<br>
Furthermore, the time delays can preferably be adapted during<br>
the stimulation, in accordance with Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2.<br>
4.	The measured neural activity is amplified. The measured<br>
neural activity is several orders of magnitude less than the<br>
stimulation amplitudes which, from experience, lead to a<br>
stimulation effect. Amplification must therefore be carried out,<br>
and can be adapted in accordance with Section 7.2.3 during the<br>
stimulation.<br>
5.	Since signals with high gradients have a major effect on the<br>
neural dynamics, the measured neural activity is coded, for<br>
example, in the form of pulse trains or high-frequency pulse<br>
trains comprising short square-wave pulses. Other coding<br><br><br>
methods can also be used in order to increase the stimulation<br>
effect.<br>
6.	The polarity of the neural activity is changed. By way of<br>
example, this has been used for the overall stimulus sketched in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
7.	The maximum amplitude of the stimulation signal is restricted.<br>
8.	The measured neural activity is in contrast transformed so as<br>
to produce stimulation signals whose net charge introduced is<br>
essentially zero.<br>
Except for item 3, items 1,2 and 4 to 6 can be used optionally.<br>
The processed neural activity is determined by the use of any desired<br>
combination of the processing steps mentioned above.<br>
3.3 Form of the individual stimuli<br>
In the following text, the expression an individual stimulus means a<br>
stimulation stimulus which is applied via a single electrode and acts in a<br>
time interval. The feedback stimulation signal, that is to say the neural<br>
activity processed in accordance with Section 3.2, is used for these<br>
stimulation stimuli.<br>
In this case, the expression time-coordinate stimulation means, by way of<br>
example, that the individual stimuli are applied via the respective electrode<br>
2 with respectively suitable time delays, preferably different time delays,<br>
and also for a different duration - as described in Section 3.4 - in order to<br>
produce desynchronization between the stimulated sub-populations and<br>
within the sub-populations of the neuron populations to be desynchronized.<br>
The time delays are stated, for example, as fractions of the period of the<br>
oscillatory neural activity to be desynchronized and are preferably<br><br><br>
essentially a multiple of one N-th of the period, where N is a small integer,<br>
for example 4. N is in this case an integer, preferably below 1000,<br>
particularly preferably less than 100 and in particular less than 10.<br>
The time delays of the individual stimuli can also be chosen, for example,<br>
to be greater than the stimulation period T. For this purpose, the apparatus<br>
according to the invention has means which apply the described electrical<br>
stimulation stimuli in the described manner. The means are electrodes 2,<br>
and a controller 4 which emits control signals to be electrodes 2 in order to<br>
emit these stimuli. Furthermore sensors 3 and the unit for signal processing<br>
4, which records the neural activity and prepares for the further use as<br>
stimulation stimuli. The individual stimuli which are applied via the<br>
electrodes 2 are referred to as the overall stimulus, and achieve<br>
desynchronization in the neuron population to be desynchronized on the<br>
basis of the active mechanism of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Examples of overall stimuli are shown in Figures 3 and 4. One individual<br>
stimulus is preferably emitted via each electrode in the course of one<br>
overall stimulus.<br>
If overall stimuli are applied repetitively, the electrodes 2 which are driven<br>
in the course of an overall stimulus may be varied. In particular, the subset<br>
of the electrodes 2 which are driven for the respective overall stimulus can<br>
be selected by means of a stochiostic and/or deterministic algorithm.<br>
3.4 Pattern of the overall stimuli<br>
In the course of the application of an overall stimulus, one individual<br>
stimulus is applied via at least two stimulation electrodes 2, but preferably<br>
via each individual stimulation electrode 2. Overall stimuli are preferably<br>
generated whose net charge introduced is essentially zero. The individual<br>
stimulus may assume the forms described in Section 3.3.<br>
The individual stimuli which are applied via the various electrodes 2 may<br><br><br>
but need not be different in terms of the nature and/or intensity, for<br>
example governed by the gain. For this purpose, the apparatus according<br>
to the invention has a controller which is programmed such that it can vary<br>
the nature and/or the intensity of the individual stimuli. The nature and the<br>
intensity of the individual stimuli are governed by the parameters which are<br>
used for the processing steps as described in Section 3.2.<br>
By way of example, in the case of direct stimulation via N electrodes 2, the<br>
same individual stimulus, in the form of the same processed neural activity<br>
in accordance with Section 3.2, can in each case be applied with a<br>
difference in the time delay of in each case T/N, where T is the stimulation<br>
period. By way of example, the same continuous stimulation stimuli can be<br>
administered via the first, second, third and fourth electrodes 2 for N = 4<br>
with time delays which are in each case shifted by 774, as is illustrated in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
For this purpose, the apparatus according to the invention has a controller<br>
which is programmed such that it drives N electrodes 2 with individual<br>
stimuli, whose time delays are essentially a multiple of T/N.<br>
As a further example, time delays for the stimulus application can be<br>
replaced by changing the polarity of the individual stimuli. For this purpose,<br>
the apparatus according to the invention has a controller which is<br>
programmed such that it can drive at least one of the electrodes 2 with a<br>
changing polarity in each case. For example, for N = 4, one pair of<br>
individual stimuli of opposite polarity can in each case be applied via the<br>
first and the second electrode 2, and with a time delay of 774 via the third<br>
and the fourth electrode 2, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
As an alternative to this, by way of example, particularly in the case of the<br>
demand-controlled stimulus application as described in Section 6.3, the<br>
time delays and/or the polarity and/or the application duration and/or the<br>
intensity of the individual stimuli within an overall stimulus may be varied<br>
systematically or on a randomly controlled basis, that is to say on the basis<br><br><br>
of a deterministic or stochastic rule. For this purpose, the apparatus<br>
according to the invention has a controller which is programmed such that<br>
it drives the time delays and/or the polarity and/or the application duration<br>
and/or the intensity of the individual stimuli within an overall stimulus<br>
deterministically and/or stochastically.<br>
By variation of the time delays and/or the polarity and/or the application<br>
duration and/or the intensity of the individual stimuli within the overall<br>
stimuli, it is possible to prevent adaptation processes in the neuron<br>
populations which result in an increase in the stimulation intensity in order<br>
to achieve the same therapeutic effect.<br>
4 Number and spatial arrangement of the electrodes and sensors<br>
4.1 Number of stimulation electrodes<br>
The number of electrodes 2 is a compromise between two opposing aims:<br>
On the one hand, the neuron population to be desynchronized should be<br>
split into as many functional sub-populations as possible by the stimulation.<br>
This is achieved to a greater extent the greater the number of electrodes<br>
used for stimulation. On the other hand, the number of electrodes to be<br>
implanted should be kept as small as possible in order to prevent<br>
unnecessary tissue damage and, in particular, brain bleeding during the<br>
implantation. At least two electrodes may be used. By way of example, it is<br>
also possible to use three electrodes. It is particularly preferable to use four<br>
electrodes, since the desynchronization is more pronounced and longer<br>
lasting when using four electrodes. If the number of electrodes is increased<br>
to five or up to 100 or more, the desynchronization effect is improved in<br>
terms of the extent and duration. The use of a greater number of electrodes<br>
may be feasible, for example, when micro-electrodes and/or modern<br>
neurochip technologies are used.<br>
4.1.1	Embodiment for the situation in which all the electrodes 2<br>
are positioned in the nerve cell population to be<br><br><br>
desynchronized<br>
The N electrodes, where N is an integer greater than 1, should preferably<br>
be arranged such that approximately one N-th of the nerve cell population<br>
to be desynchronized can be stimulated by each individual electrode. This<br>
can be achieved with a different number of electrodes and with a different<br>
geometric arrangement of the electrodes with respect to one another. By<br>
way of example, it is possible to choose any desired asymmetric<br>
arrangement. However, essentially symmetrical arrangements are<br>
preferable, particularly when a small number of stimulation electrodes are<br>
being used since, in this case, it is possible for the same distances to occur<br>
between the electrodes, thus allowing the stimulation-dependent functional<br>
splitting into equivalent sub-populations with the least amount of power<br>
being introduced. By way of example, the end points of the electrodes,<br>
projected along the electrodes, may essentially form a square. By way of<br>
example, it is also possible to use six electrodes. In this case, four are<br>
preferably arranged essentially in a square on one plane, while the other<br>
two are located essentially equidistantly at right angles to this plane, with<br>
their connecting line essentially forming the axis of rotation of the four<br>
electrodes which are arranged in a square. At least some of the electrodes<br>
may also have different lengths in order to produce different geometric<br>
arrangements. According to the prior art, it is possible to combine a<br>
plurality of stimulation electrodes in one stimulation electrode to be<br>
implanted, for example by positioning the stimulation contacts at different<br>
distances from the end of the electrode. This makes it possible to achieve<br>
the same stimulation effect with a small number of electrodes to be<br>
implanted, thus further reducing the occurrence of brain damage.<br>
4.1.2 Embodiment for the situation in which at least one<br>
electrode 2 is not positioned in the nerve cell population to<br>
be desynchronized<br>
In this stimulation form, stimulation is carried out in at least one target area,<br>
which is different from the area to be desynchronized. In this case, the<br><br><br>
indirect stimulation can be carried out by stimulation of a neuron population<br>
which is not the same as the nerve cell population to be desynchronized,<br>
and/or by stimulation of a fiber group which is linked to the nerve cell<br>
population to be desynchronized. In this case, either at least one electrode<br>
2 or a multiple electrode arrangement as described in Section 4.1.1 can be<br>
1 used in a target area, for example in the area to be desynchronized.<br>
4.2 Number of sensors<br>
The mechanism of the apparatus according to the invention essentially<br>
comprises, as described in Sections 1 and 3, the measured and processed<br>
neural activities of the neuron population to be desynchronized being<br>
applied again as stimulation. The sensors 3 are one of the most important<br>
components of the apparatus according to the invention and, as described<br>
in Section 3.1, may be positioned either outside the neuron population to<br>
be desynchronized or preferably directly in the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. Only one sensor 3 is preferably used, in order to detect<br>
the activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized. This keeps the<br>
number of sensors to be implanted as small as possible, in order to prevent<br>
unnecessary tissue damage and, in particular, brain bleeding during the<br>
implantation. However, for example, it is also possible to use two or more<br>
sensors in order to reconstruct the neural activity of the neuron population<br>
to be desynchronized much more completely as a combination of the<br>
measured activities.<br>
Furthermore, possible brain damage caused by the implantation is further<br>
reduced or avoided, and the stimulation effect is improved, by combining<br>
the sensors 3 and stimulation electrodes 2 in one electrode to be<br>
implanted.<br>
4.2.1	Embodiment for the situation in which the sensors 3 are all<br>
positioned in the nerve cell population to be<br>
desynchronized<br><br><br>
The sensors 3 should preferably be arranged such that a large proportion<br>
of the nerve cell population to be desynchronized can be detected by<br>
means of the sensors. This can be achieved with a different geometric<br>
arrangement of the sensors with respect to the tissue to be<br>
desynchronized. In the case of an arrangement with only one sensor 3, this<br>
may be located, for example, in the center of the tissue. In the case of<br>
arrangements having a plurality of sensors, as described in Section 4.1.1,<br>
the sensors may be arranged in a similar manner to that which has been<br>
described for the stimulation electrodes.<br>
4.2.2 Embodiment for the situation in which at least one of the<br>
sensors 3 is not positioned in the nerve cell population to<br>
be desynchronized<br>
In this form of the activity measurement, an activity which is associated<br>
with the neural activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized is<br>
measured in at least one area which is not the same as the area to be<br>
desynchronized. In this case, as described in Section 3.1, the indirect<br>
measurement can be carried out by measurement of the activity of a<br>
neuron population which is not the same as the nerve cell population to be<br>
synchronized and/or of a fiber group and/or of a body part which is linked to<br>
the nerve cell population to be desynchronized.<br>
5 Self-regulating demand control of the stimulation amplitude<br>
One of the most important characteristics of the mechanism of the<br>
apparatus according to the invention is self-regulating demand control of<br>
the amplitude of the stimulation signal which is applied to the area to be<br>
desynchronized. The described self-regulation is carried out by the applied<br>
individual stimuli comprising the processed neural activity. When there is<br>
relatively strong synchronous activity in the area to be desynchronized, a<br>
large variance can be expected in the measured neural activity, as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art. This leads directly to a time-delayed<br>
stimulation according to the invention, with an increased stimulation<br><br><br>
amplitude. After achieving desynchronization, only neural activity with a<br>
small variance will be expected, as a result of which the stimulation<br>
amplitude is directly influenced, and is automatically reduced. If<br>
resynchronization occurs again, then the apparatus according to the<br>
invention can automatically take account of the increased requirement for<br>
desynchronizing stimulation, by the greater variance in the neural activity<br>
leading to the formation of stronger individual stimuli. This represents self-<br>
regulating demand control of the apparatus according to the invention, see<br>
also Figure 2c.<br>
The mechanism on which the self-regulating demand control is based is<br>
used in all the embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
that are described in more detail in the following text.<br>
6 Control of the stimulus application<br>
The expression time control of the stimulus application means an<br>
embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention which is preferably<br>
programmed in advance, with the overall stimuli being applied in the<br>
specific manner by means of the stimulator unit 8. The variants of time<br>
control of the stimulus application are permanent, repetitive and demand-<br>
controlled stimulus application. In addition, manual demand control can be<br>
implemented, for example for a stimulus application carried out by the<br>
patient or by the doctor.<br>
6.1 Permanent stimulus application<br>
In the case of permanent stimulus application, the apparatus according to<br>
the invention has a controller which is programmed such that it<br>
continuously applies the stimulation signals to the electrodes 2. Permanent<br>
stimulus application represents the simplest embodiment, which is the<br>
easiest to implement, of the apparatus according to the invention. At the<br>
same time, the self-regulating demand control according to the invention as<br>
described in Section 5 results in a good desynchronizing effect of<br><br><br>
permanent stimulation while introducing little energy into the target<br>
population.<br>
During permanent stimulus application, the intensity parameters can be<br>
adapted in accordance with Section 7.2.3. In the same way, the time<br>
parameters - the stimulation period Tand/or time delays -can be adapted<br>
during permanent stimulation in accordance with Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2<br>
in conjunction with adaptation of the stimulation intensity, or independently<br>
of it.<br>
6.2 Repetitive stimulus application<br>
In the case of repetitive stimulus application, the apparatus according to<br>
the invention has a controller which is programmed such that it applies the<br>
stimulation signals to the electrodes 2 only during specific time intervals.<br>
There is no stimulation outside these time intervals.<br>
In the case of repetitive stimulus application, the overall stimuli can be<br>
administered on a strictly periodic time basis or on a non-periodic time<br>
basis. In this embodiment, the apparatus according to the invention has a<br>
controller which is programmed such that it periodically and/or non-<br>
periodically monitors the time intervals between the stimulation intervals<br>
and/or the duration of the intervals. A sequence of overall stimuli which is<br>
not periodic in time can be generated by means of a stochastic and/or<br>
deterministic algorithm, in order to achieve the desired desynchronized<br>
state of the population to be desynchronized. The stimulation and<br>
measurement intervals may be arranged such that they overlap, occur at<br>
the same time, or occur at separate times.<br>
During repetitive stimulus application, the intensity parameters can be<br>
adapted in accordance with Section 7.2.3. In the same way the time<br>
parameters - the stimulation period T and/or time delays - can be adapted<br>
during repetitive stimulation in accordance with Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 in<br>
conjunction with adaptation of the stimulation intensity, or independently of<br><br><br>
it.<br>
6.3 Demand-controlled stimulus application<br>
In the case of demand-controlled stimulus application, the apparatus<br>
according to the invention has a controller which is programmed such that<br>
it switches the stimulation signals on and off in a manner corresponding to<br>
the specific states of the neuron population to be desynchronized. By way<br>
of example, the stimulation is switched on as described in the following<br>
text.<br>
The activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized is measured by<br>
means of the sensor 3. The neural activity is passed to the unit 4 for signal<br>
processing and/or closed-loop control which, inter alia, acts as means for<br>
identification of a pathological feature. As soon as the unit 4 for signal<br>
processing and/or closed-loop control identifies a pathological feature in<br>
the neural activity, the application of an overall stimulus is started. As soon<br>
as the pathological feature disappears as a result of the effect of the<br>
applied stimulation, stimulation is preferably switched off. In one possible<br>
embodiment as a unit 4 for signal processing and/or open-loop/closed-loop<br>
control, the apparatus according to the invention therefore has a computer<br>
which contains a data storage medium, in which the data relating to the<br>
clinical signs is stored and is compared with the measurement data. The<br>
expression the data relating to the clinical signs means parameters and<br>
measurement variables which are relevant for the stimulation, for example<br>
the instantaneous frequency of the neural activity measured by means of<br>
the sensor 3, of the threshold value which is required for the procedure for<br>
demand-controlled stimulus application, and the stimulation parameters<br>
which define the stimulus intensity. The expression a pathological feature<br>
means, for example, illness-dependent synchronization of the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized, and can be identified by the following<br>
characteristics of the neural activity:<br>
a) If the pathological activity of the neuron population to be<br><br><br>
desynchronized and/or of a neuron population which is closely<br>
linked to this neuron population and/or a closely linked part of the<br>
nervous system or the musculature is measured exclusively or<br>
predominantly by means of the sensor 3, for example in the case of<br>
the direct measurement as described in Section 3.1 and<br>
Section 4.2.1, the neural activity is used directly to determine<br>
whether the amplitude of the neural activity exceeds a threshold<br>
value. The apparatus according to the invention is thus, in one<br>
preferred embodiment, equipped with means for identification of a<br>
value of the amplitude of the neural activity corresponding to the<br>
threshold value. In this case, the neural activity itself, and/or its<br>
magnitude and/or its amplitude are/is preferably compared with the<br>
threshold value. The means for identification of the threshold value<br>
may in this embodiment be programmed such that, for example, it<br>
compares the neurai activity itself and/or its magnitude and/or its<br>
amplitude with the threshold value. The amplitude is determined<br>
either in a simple version by determination of the magnitude of the<br>
signal, and/or with bandpass filtering and subsequent Hilbert<br>
transformation, or wavelet analysis. The unit 4 for signal processing<br>
and/or closed-loop control is in this case programmed such that it<br>
can determine the magnitude of the signal and/or bandpass filtering<br>
with Hilbert transformation and/or wavelet analysis. The neural<br>
activity or its magnitude is particularly preferably used, since the<br>
calculation of the amplitude involves considerably more computation<br>
effort, and the determination of the amplitude cannot be carried out<br>
on a single measured value of the neural activity but must be carried<br>
out at a sufficiently long time interval, as is known by those skilled in<br>
the art, and this can somewhat delay the identification of the<br>
pathological feature,<br>
b) If activity which is not yet illness-specific, for example from other<br>
neuron populations, is additionally measured by means of the<br>
sensor 3 as well as this pathological activity of the neuron population<br>
to be desynchronized, for example as in the case of the indirect<br>
measurement described in Sections 3.1 and 4.2.2, a further<br><br><br>
algorithm step must be introduced during the analysis of the neural<br>
activity. Since the illness-specific activity typically occurs in a<br>
frequency range which is different from the frequency range of the<br>
non-illness-specific activity, it is preferably suitable for this purpose<br>
to estimate the activity in the illness-specific frequency range. The<br>
frequency of the illness-specific activity is determined, for example,<br>
by determination of the difference between successive trigger<br>
points. Trigger points are points such as maxima, minima, points of<br>
inflection and zero crossings. This analysis preferably carried out<br>
using a sliding time window, with the mean value of a plurality of<br>
time differences being formed, thus improving the stability.<br>
Alternatively, the frequency estimate can also be determined by<br>
spectral estimation methods and other frequency estimators, which<br>
are known to those skilled in the art. For this purpose, one particular<br>
embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention has means<br>
for estimation of the activity in the illness-specific frequency range,<br>
such as spectral estimation methods, wavelet analysis etc. This is<br>
achieved, by way of example, by means for carrying out a frequency<br>
analysis. By way of example, the spectral energy in the illness-<br>
specific frequency range can be determined using a sliding window.<br>
Alternatively, after bandpass filtering, the amplitude in the illness-<br>
specific frequency range can be determined by determination of the<br>
maximum of the bandpass-filtered signal or by determination of the<br>
mean value of the magnitude of the bandpass-filtered signal, or with<br>
subsequent Hilbert transformation or by means of wavelet analysis.<br>
For this purpose, the apparatus according to the invention has, for<br>
example, means for bandpass filtering of the amplitude and means<br>
for determination of the maximum of the bandpass-filtered signal,<br>
and/or means for determination of the mean value of the magnitude<br>
of the bandpass-filtered signal, and/or means for carrying out a<br>
Hilbert transformation and/or a wavelet analysis.<br>
By way of example, the same overall stimulus is always used for demand-<br>
controlled stimulus application. The stimulation period T is preferably<br><br><br>
matched to the instantaneous frequency of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, as described in Section 7.2.1. When the pathological<br>
feature is present, a stimulus is then applied with a stimulation period T<br>
matched to the instantaneous frequency. The time delays can likewise be<br>
adapted in accordance with Section 7.2.2, and/or the intensity of this<br>
stimulus in this case preferably remains constant. However, as in<br>
Section 7.2.3, the intensity parameters can be modified in accordance with<br>
the stimulation effect.<br>
6.3.1 Definition of the requirement<br>
For at least two reasons, there is no unique relationship between the extent<br>
of the pathological feature and the extent of the illness-specific symptoms.<br>
On the one hand, the distance between the sensor 3 and the area to be<br>
desynchronized, in which the neural activity to be measured is generated,<br>
results in a change in the amplitude in the illness-specific frequency range.<br>
On the other hand, a specific extent of the illness-specific feature, that is to<br>
say the extent of the rhythmic activity in the illness-specific frequency<br>
range, is not unambiguously linked with the illness-specific symptoms.<br>
Since the illness-specific rhythm affects complex nerve networks in the<br>
brain which typically, on top of everything else, do not satisfy simple linear<br>
dynamic laws, there are no unambiguous relationships between the illness-<br>
specific rhythm and the extent of the symptoms. If, for example, the illness-<br>
specific rhythm does not sufficiently well match the biomechanically<br>
predetermined natural frequency of an extremity, the tremor which is<br>
caused by the illness-specific rhythm is considerably less than if the illness-<br>
specific rhythm were to resonantly match the biomechanically<br>
predetermined natural frequency of the extremity.<br>
The characteristic property, such as the dominant frequency and the<br>
amplitude, of the measured neural activity are in an empirical range which<br>
is known to those skilled in the art. The value of the extent of the illness-<br>
specific feature of the neural activity measured by means of the sensor 3 is<br>
referred to as a threshold which, if exceeded, typically results in the<br><br><br>
occurrence of symptoms, for example of the tremor. The threshold is a<br>
parameter which must be chosen for the embodiment of the demand-<br>
controlled stimulus application as described in Section 6.3. The apparatus<br>
according to the invention thus has means, in the form of the control unit 4,<br>
for identification of a threshold value. The method according to the<br>
invention for demand-controlled stimulus application results in the<br>
advantage that the effectiveness of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention does not critically depend on the choice of the threshold, but<br>
there is a wide error tolerance with regard to the choice of the threshold, for<br>
example in a range of up to 50% of the maximum extent of the illness-<br>
specific feature. The choice of the threshold is determined either<br>
intraoperatively or preferably in the initial days after the operation by<br>
measurement of the neural activity by means of the sensor 3, with the<br>
extent of the illness-specific feature being determined, and being compared<br>
with the extent of the symptoms, for example the intensity of the tremor.<br>
In a less preferred embodiment of the demand-controlled stimulus<br>
application, a representative value, for example the mean value, of a range<br>
of a threshold values measured in patients is adopted as the threshold.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the choice of the threshold is checked<br>
essentially at regular intervals, for example in the course of six-monthly<br>
inspections.<br>
In the repetitive stimulation embodiment with demand-controlled stimulus<br>
intensity as described in Section 6.2, there is no need for threshold value<br>
detection.<br>
The three stimulation methods described above can preferably be used in<br>
a different combination with the methods for adaptation of the stimulation<br>
parameters as described in Section 7.2.<br>
The inherent self-regulating demand control according to the invention is a<br>
common feature of all three stimulation methods. The direct relationship<br><br><br>
between the stimulation signals and the measured neural activity results in<br>
self-regulating demand control as described in Section 5, thus minimizing<br>
the amount of energy introduced into the target population. This self-<br>
regulating demand control acts independently of the implementation of the<br>
additional demand control as described in Section 6.3, and of the<br>
calibration and closed-loop control of the parameters as is described in<br>
Section 7.<br>
7 Calibration and adaptation of the parameters<br>
The following text is based on the assumption that all the electrodes 2 are<br>
located in the neuron population to be desynchronized. The situation in<br>
which at least one electrode is located outside the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized will be considered separately at the end of the section. By<br>
way of example, a calibration and adaptation can be carried out for the<br>
following parameters of the apparatus according to the invention: the<br>
frequency of the stimulation signal, whose reciprocal corresponds to the<br>
stimulation period, the time delays of the individual stimuli, and the intensity<br>
of the individual stimuli.<br>
7.1 Stimulation parameters at the start of the stimulation<br>
7.1.1 Frequency, stimulation period<br>
Choice of the frequency without previous operation of the apparatus: the<br>
frequency range of the pathological neural activity for the respective clinical<br>
signs is known to those skilled in the art (Elble R.J. and Koller W.C. (1990):<br>
Tremor, John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore). The mean value can<br>
preferably be taken from this frequency range. Alternatively, instead of this,<br>
the frequency value to be expected on an age- and gender-specific basis<br>
can be used from a database.<br>
For successful operation of the apparatus according to the invention, there<br>
is no need for the initially predetermined frequency to match the actually<br><br><br>
occurring frequency of the activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. The control of the stimulation period T as described in<br>
7.2.1 operates even when an initial value which differs to a major extent<br>
from the correct frequency value is used. In this case, differing to a major<br>
extent means that the value may even be too large or too small by a factor<br>
of at least 10. Alternatively, it is thus also preferably possible to start with a<br>
frequency value which is in the typical frequency range for the illness, as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The value of the frequency at the start of<br>
the stimulation can also preferably be obtained by individual matching to<br>
the respective patient. This may be done, for example, by means of a<br>
measurement of the neural activity prior to the stimulation, and estimation<br>
of the dominant frequency in the activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, as described in Section 6.3b.<br>
Choice of the frequency with previous operation of the apparatus: the mean<br>
value of the frequency during the previous operation of the apparatus is<br>
chosen as the start value for the frequency.<br>
In both cases, that is to say with and without previous operation of the<br>
apparatus, the stimulation period T is calculated as the reciprocal of the<br>
start value of the frequency.<br>
7.1.2 Time delays<br>
The time delays for the individual stimuli are preferably determined after<br>
initial definition of the stimulation frequency and of the stimulation period T.<br>
The time delays are preferably chosen as fractions of the stimulation period<br>
7", with a different time delay preferably being assigned to each individual<br>
stimulus. The time delays are preferably determined in such a way that the<br>
difference between the time delays corresponds to fractions of the<br>
stimulation period 7", so that the difference between the time delays would<br>
thus be a multiple of 7/N in the situation in which the time delays are<br>
equidistant. Equidistant time delays are, however, not necessary for<br>
successful desynchronization of the neuron population to be<br><br><br>
desynchronized. It is also preferable to choose time delays which<br>
correspond to a multiple of fractions of the stimulation period T and which<br>
may exceed the stimulation period T. The adaptation of the time delays as<br>
described in Section 7.2.2 also works in the situation described above, in<br>
which at least some of the time delays exceed the stimulation period T.<br>
7.1.3 Intensity<br>
The initial values of the stimulation parameters which determine the<br>
intensity of the individual stimuli (for example the gain of the feedback<br>
stimulation signal) are defined in accordance with the empirical values<br>
which are known to those skilled in the art (for example a maximum<br>
amplitude of 5 V). The intensity control as described in 7.2.3 works even<br>
when an initial value is used which differs to a major extent from the best<br>
intensity value. In this case, differing to a major extent means that the value<br>
may even be too large (maximum amplitude 5 V) or too small by a factor of<br>
at least 10. Alternatively, it is thus also preferable to start with an intensity<br>
value which is in the range that is known to those skilled in the art. In<br>
particular, it is preferable to start a stimulation with low values of the<br>
intensity, for example a maximum amplitude of 0.5 V, for the stimulation<br>
signals, in order in this way to reduce as far as possible the side-effects of<br>
the stimulation. If there is a need to use stronger stimulation signals, the<br>
intensity can be increased in small steps, as described in Section 7.2.3.<br>
The initial values for the frequency and intensity can thus be<br>
predetermined, but in particular need not be predetermined in the course of<br>
a time-consuming calibration.<br>
7.2 Adaptation of the stimulation parameters<br>
7.2.1 Adaptation of the stimulation period T<br>
The neural activity is measured in the area to be desynchronized or in an<br>
area which is closely linked to it, and is used, after processing, as the<br><br><br>
stimulation signal. By way of example, in the case of Parkinson's disease,<br>
instead of a measurement by means of the sensors 3, a measurement of<br>
the activity in a subsequent area, for example the premotor cortex, by<br>
means of epicortical sensors, can also be carried out directly in the area to<br>
be desynchronized. The dominant mean period is determined in a time<br>
window with a length as stated in the following text. Various algorithms can<br>
be used for this purpose. For example, the instantaneous period can be<br>
determined as the time difference between two successive maxima of the<br>
measured neural activity. It is also, for example, possible to first of all<br>
estimate the mean frequency of the neural activity, and to define the<br>
stimulation period T as the reciprocal of the mean frequency. If not only<br>
illness-specific activity is measured by means of the sensor 3, the illness-<br>
specific activity must first of all be extracted, by bandpass filtering of the<br>
frequency range that is specific for that illness, for this type of frequency<br>
estimation. Alternatively, by way of example, the frequency can be<br>
determined by means of the frequency estimator that is mentioned in<br>
Section 6.3. The time window which is used for this frequency estimate has<br>
a length which may be open towards upper values and corresponds, for<br>
example, to 10 000 periods, preferably to 1000 periods and particularly<br>
preferably to 100 periods of the activity relating to the illness, or else to any<br>
other desired values.<br>
7.2.2 Adaptation of the time delays<br>
As described in Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 7.1.2, the time delays for the<br>
individual stimuli are typically chosen as fractions of the stimulation period<br>
T. By way of example, the time delays may be fixed during the stimulation,<br>
or may preferably be matched to the stimulation period that has been<br>
adapted in accordance with Section 7.2.1. In order to make it possible to<br>
achieve optimum desynchronization with a low stimulation intensity, the<br>
time delays of the individual stimuli are preferably varied during the<br>
stimulation by means of a deterministic or stochastic algorithm. For this<br>
purpose, the apparatus according to the invention has means in the form of<br>
the control unit 4 which allow the time delays of the individual stimuli to be<br><br><br>
varied during the stimulation. Furthermore, for example, the time delays<br>
can be varied not only within a stimulation period but also over a plurality of<br>
periods. In this case, the individual stimuli correspond to the processed<br>
neural activity which was measured at a time several periods earlier.<br>
7.2.3 Adaptation of the intensity<br>
The sensor 3 is used to measure the neural activity which represents the<br>
activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized. This neural activity<br>
is passed to the unit 4 for signal processing and/or control purposes. The<br>
unit 4 for signal processing and/or control carries out a permanent,<br>
repetitive or demand-controlled stimulation in accordance with Section 6,<br>
with the intensity of the overall stimuli which are applied at the respective<br>
time being dependent on the extent of the pathological feature in the neural<br>
activity. The intensity can preferably be adapted for this purpose. The<br>
relationship between the stimulus intensity and the extent of the<br>
pathological feature can be controlled either manually or automatically as a<br>
function of the stimulation success. The extent of the pathological feature is<br>
determined in a time window with a freely variable, preferably constant,<br>
length, which ends at a constant time interval before the respective<br>
stimulus, in the following manner:<br>
a) In the situation when the sensor 3 is used to measure exclusively or<br>
predominantly the pathological activity to be desynchronized and/or<br>
a neural or muscular activity which is closely linked to it, the<br>
amplitude of the extent of the synchronization corresponds to the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized. The amplitude thus<br>
represents the pathological feature. The amplitude can in this case<br>
be estimated by determination of the maximum of the signal or by<br>
means of the mean value of the magnitude of the signal, or by<br>
bandpass filtering with subsequent Hilbert transformation or wavelet<br>
analysis. The first two variants (determination of the maximum of the<br>
signal or determination of the mean value of the magnitude of the<br>
signal) are particularly preferably used, since the calculation of the<br>
amplitude by means of a Hilbert transformation or wavelet analysis<br><br><br>
involves considerably more computation complexity, their accuracy<br>
depends on the correct choice of algorithmic parameters,<br>
b) If the sensor 3 is used to measure not only the illness-specific<br>
activity but additionally inactivity which is not yet illness-specific, for<br>
example from other neuron populations, the neural activity cannot<br>
be used directly for estimation of the extent of the pathological<br>
feature. Since the illness-specific activity typically occurs in a<br>
frequency range which is not the same as the frequency range of<br>
the non-illness-specific activity, the activity in the illness-specific<br>
frequency range is preferably estimated in this situation. This is<br>
done, for example, by means of a frequency analysis. For example,<br>
the spectral energy can be determined in the illness-specific<br>
frequency range. As an alternative to this, the amplitude can be<br>
determined after bandpass filtering by determination of the<br>
maximum of the bandpass-filtered signal or by determination of the<br>
mean value of the magnitude of the signal, or by subsequent Hilbert<br>
transformation or wavelet analysis.<br>
If the desired effect is not achieved, that is to say the target population is<br>
not desynchronized to an adequate extent and the pathological feature of<br>
the neural activity is therefore not shifted below the threshold value, the<br>
maximum intensity of the stimulus is slowly increased up to a maximum<br>
value, for example of 5 V, which is stringently predetermined for safety<br>
reasons (for example in steps of 0.5 V per 50 periods). For this purpose,<br>
the apparatus according to the invention has a controller which identifies<br>
any change in the neural activity and adapts the stimulating signals in the<br>
direction of higher values if there is no change in the neural activity. After<br>
about 20 successful periods of the stimulation, the apparatus can start to<br>
slowly reduce the maximum intensity of the stimulus (for example in steps<br>
of 0.5 V per 50 periods), provided that the stimulation is still successful.<br>
The stimulation success is determined during this process as described<br>
above. The controller is in this case programmed such that it identifies the<br>
change in the neural activity, and thus the stimulation success. The<br>
maximum stimulus intensity is preferably controlled on a time scale of<br><br><br>
between 10 and 1000 periods of the neural activity, such that the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized is adequately desynchronized.<br>
Independently of the value of the stimulation intensity as defined above, the<br>
amplitude of the stimulation signal is automatically minimized as a<br>
consequence of the characteristics, as described in Section 5, of the<br>
stimulation mechanism of the apparatus according to the invention after<br>
successful desynchronization.<br>
7.3 Stimulation parameters for the situation in which at least one<br>
electrode 2 is not located in the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized<br>
As in the situation described in Section 3.3 of an electrode 2 which is not<br>
located in the neuron population to be desynchronized, the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized is influenced via an indirect stimulation, as<br>
described in Section 4.1.2. Since, in the case of indirect stimulation, the<br>
conduction times between the stimulated neuron populations on the one<br>
hand and the neuron population to be desynchronized on the other hand<br>
may each be of a different magnitude, the respective conduction times are<br>
first of all measured before carrying out the desynchronizing stimulation.<br>
Stimulation is for this purpose carried out via in each case one stimulation<br>
electrode 2, and the stimulus response is measured by means of the<br>
sensors 3 which are placed in the neuron population to be desynchronized.<br>
This is done separately n-times for all stimulation electrodes 2 which are<br>
used for indirect stimulation, with n typically being a small integer, up to for<br>
example 200. The mean conduction time is preferably estimated from this<br>
in the following manner:<br>
The duration between the start of the stimulus application via the j-th<br>
electrode 2 and the first maximum in the stimulation response or in the<br>
magnitude of the stimulation response, is determined for each<br>
individual stimulus application. In the case of , the index j represents the<br>
j-th electrode 2, while the index k represents the k-th applied stimulus.<br><br><br>
The mean duration between the stimulus start and the stimulus response is<br>
then determined separately from this for each stimulation electrode 2 that is<br>
used for indirect stimulation, using the following formula 1:<br><br>
Formula I<br>
In this case, Lj is the number of stimuli applied via the j-th stimulation<br>
electrode 2. Ls may but need not be the same for all stimulation electrodes<br>
2 which are used for indirect stimulation.<br>
The conduction time determined in this way for the stimulation is taken<br>
into account in the following manner:<br>
If a stimulus were applied by direct stimulation of the neuron population to<br>
be desynchronized with a time delay f of 2 via the j-th stimulation electrode<br>
2, then, in the case of indirect stimulation, the stimulus would be<br>
administered with a time delay of , via the j-th stimulation electrode 2 for<br>
indirect stimulation, in which case r must be greater than as can be<br>
done in accordance with Section 7.2.2.<br>
The determination of the stimulation parameters at the start of the<br>
stimulation and the control mechanisms during the stimulation are<br>
completely analogous when the conduction times are taken into account<br>
as described above, as described in Sections 7.1 and 7.2.<br>
8 Advantages<br>
The apparatus according to the invention has a number of advantages over<br>
existing apparatuses, for example DE 108 18 071.0-33 "Vorrichtung zur<br><br>
Desynchronisation von neuronaler Hirnaktivitat" [Apparatus for<br>
desynchronization of neural brain activity]:<br>
1. The major advantage of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention is that a physiological stimulus, specifically the<br>
feedback stimulation signal, that is to say the measured and<br>
processed neural activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, is used for the stimulation. The self-regulating<br>
demand control of the stimulation amplitude as described in<br>
Section 5 thus takes place, thus minimizing the amount of<br>
energy introduced into the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, and thus lead to side-effects that are minor.<br>
2.	Because of the self-regulating stimulation amplitude in<br>
accordance with Section 5, the operation of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention saves power, since not only is a<br>
power-saving signal used for stimulation on the basis of the<br>
demand-controlled stimulation amplitude, but a saving in energy<br>
can also be expected in the case of the control apparatuses<br>
according to the invention, as are required for stimulation<br>
control. This makes it possible to achieve longer intervals<br>
between the necessity for battery changes, which is<br>
burdensome for the patient.<br>
3.	The embodiment of the repetitive or permanent application<br>
with demand-controlled stimulus intensity is particularly<br>
advantageous, since no threshold need be detected with this<br>
method. This embodiment can thus be implemented with<br>
considerably simpler algorithms. Its software and/or hardware<br>
implementation is accordingly considerably less complex.<br>
4.	In the case of permanent and repetitive stimulation with<br>
demand-controlled stimulus intensity and direct stimulation of<br>
the neuron population to be desynchronized, no calibration is<br><br><br>
required, that is to say there is no need to carry out a series of<br>
test stimuli in which the stimulation parameters are varied<br>
systematically, thus leading to the calibration duration being<br>
shorter.<br>
5.	The calibration which is carried out according to the invention<br>
is quicker, less susceptible to errors and is less complex since,<br>
in the case of direct stimulation, it is possible to start stimulation<br>
operation without any test stimulation, with the parameters being<br>
optimized in the course of stimulation operation, as described in<br>
Section 7.2. Because the calibration can be carried out quickly,<br>
the apparatus according to the invention can even be used<br>
intraoperatively, thus optimizing the placing of the deep<br>
electrodes 2. This makes it possible to use the effect of the<br>
desynchronizing stimulation on the extent of the symptoms, for<br>
example the tremor, directly as a parameter, for the quality of<br>
the placing.<br>
6.	The calibration according to the invention is less susceptible<br>
to errors since the frequency and conduction time estimators<br>
that are used in the course of the calibration according to the<br>
invention do not depend critically on parameters such as the<br>
limits and the characteristics of a bandpass filter. This<br>
embodiment can thus be implemented with considerably simpler<br>
algorithms. Its software and hardware implementation is<br>
accordingly considerably less complex.<br>
7.	Overall, one major advantage is the general tolerance and<br>
robustness of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
compared to the estimation of the parameters of intensity,<br>
stimulation period and time delays.<br>
8.	Because of the use of the possibly different stimulation effect<br>
as a function of the distance between the electrode and the area<br><br><br>
to be stimulated, and use of the pathologically increased<br>
coupling between the neurons in the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, the apparatus according to the invention<br>
stabilizes the area to be desynchronized in a desynchronized<br>
and desired state. This state is provided permanently and thus<br>
brings the area to be desynchronized very close to the<br>
physiological state. By way of example, long-lasting<br>
desynchronization is attained without any fluctuation backwards<br>
and forwards between resynchronization and a cluster state.<br>
Example:<br>
If stimulation is carried out, for example, at four locations, then, by way of<br>
example, the following stimuli can be emitted via the four electrodes:<br>
1.	The feedback stimulation signal, that is to say the processed<br>
neural activity, is applied via each of the electrodes, with the<br>
stimulation signals in each case being offset by T/4 in time, as<br>
shown in Figure 3, when T is the mean period of the rhythm of<br>
the neuron population to be desynchronized.<br>
2.	As is illustrated in Figure 4, stimulation signals with the same<br>
time delay but of different polarity are applied via the electrodes<br>
1 and 2. The same stimulation signals with a different polarity<br>
are likewise applied via the electrodes 3 and 4.<br>
By way of example, the stimulation is carried out with three different control<br>
mechanisms, as described in Section 6, for the stimulus application thus<br>
preferably allowing demand-controlled and thus power-saving and mild<br>
(avoiding side-effects) stimulation, as described in Section 7:<br>
1. Permanent stimulus application: the stimulation is carried out<br>
permanently, see Figure 2, preferably with adaptation of the<br>
stimulation period. As can be seen by way of example in<br>
Figure 2, desynchronization of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized occurs directly after application of the<br><br><br>
stimulation. This minimizes the amplitude of the measured<br>
neural activity, see Figure 2b.<br>
At the same time, as can be seen by way of example in<br>
Figure 2c, the stimulation amplitude is minimized because of the<br>
self-regulating demand control mechanism as described in<br>
Section 5. Once the stimulation has been switched off,<br>
resynchronization occurs after a short time, owing to the<br>
pathological interaction between the neurons in the population.<br>
2.	Demand-controlled stimulus application (that is to say<br>
demand-controlled choice of the start and end times of the<br>
stimulation) of the overall stimuli: if the synchronization of the<br>
nerve cell population exceeds a threshold value, the next overall<br>
stimulus is emitted via all of the electrodes, as described in<br>
Section 6.3.<br>
3.	Repetitive stimulus application: repetitive stimulation is<br>
carried out with coordinated stimuli via all of the electrodes. In<br>
this case, the intensity of the stimuli is matched to the intensity<br>
of the synchronization of the neuron population: the greater the<br>
synchronization, the stronger is the coordinated stimulus.<br>
In this variant, can preferably be chosen rather than T/44<br>
as the time delay between the individual stimuli, where T is the<br>
period of the rhythm without stimulation ris the period forced on<br>
the rhythm by the stimulation. In other words: 1/τ is the<br>
frequency of the stimulation signal with which the individual<br>
stimuli are applied. This results in the only critical stimulation<br>
parameter to which the system is subject: instead of determining<br>
this in a suitable form in the course of a complex calibration, it is<br>
dictated by the stimulation. Furthermore, this form of demand-<br>
controlled stimulation makes use of the fact that the neurons in<br>
the relevant regions have a tendency (because of the illness) to<br>
periodic firing or bursts (rhythmic production of groups of action<br>
potentials). It is therefore possible to achieve an entrainment of<br><br><br>
the neural activity of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized, with respect to the applied frequency.<br>
In all three of the control methods described by way of example above,<br>
self-regulating demand control, as described in Section 5, results in the<br>
amount of energy introduced into the target population being minimized. In<br>
this case, it is preferably possible to adapt the only important stimulation<br>
parameters, the stimulation period T and thus the time delays, between the<br>
individual stimuli, by measurement of the frequency of the nerve cell<br>
population in the target region, or of another nerve cell population which is<br>
closely linked to it.<br>
The lack of time-consuming calibration and stabilization of the effect even<br>
in the event of relatively major frequency fluctuations - particularly in the<br>
case of method 1 (permanent stimulation) - has important consequences:<br>
1.	The stimulation success can be checked immediately,<br>
intraoperatively, during the insertion of the deep electrode. This<br>
makes it possible to considerably improve the finding of the<br>
suitable target point. A calibration process which lasts for more<br>
than 30 minutes per electrode is required for the previous<br>
demand-controlled methods. This cannot be carried out<br>
intraoperatively and is not acceptable to the patient (who is not<br>
anesthetized).<br>
2.	The new stimulation methods can also be used for<br>
neurological and psychiatric illnesses in which pathological<br>
rhythms have highly fluctuating frequencies. In particular, the<br>
new methods can also be used to desynchronize rhythms which<br>
occur intermittently (that is to say which occur for a short time).<br>
This means that the new stimulation methods can be used for<br>
many more illnesses, and particularly even in the case of<br>
epilepsies.<br>
The following illnesses and symptoms can be treated by means of the new<br><br><br>
stimulation method with the apparatus according to the invention by<br>
desynchronization of suitable brain areas.<br>
In the case of all neurological and psychiatric illnesses in which<br>
pathological neural synchronization plays a relevant role for the extent of<br>
the illness-specific symptoms, for example: Parkinson's disease, essential<br>
tremor, dystonia, compulsion disorder, tremor in the case of multiple<br>
sclerosis, tremor as a consequence of a stroke or other tissue damage, for<br>
example tumorous tissue damage, for example in the area of the thalamus<br>
and/or the basal ganglia, choreoathetosis and epilepsy, although this list is<br>
not intended to be restrictive.<br>
By way of example, the following target areas are used for the standard<br>
method of high-frequency continuous stimulation that is used at the<br>
moment:<br>
In the case of Parkinson's disease the nucleus subthalamicus or in the<br>
case of tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease the thalamus, for example<br>
the nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami.<br>
In the case of essential tremor the thalamus, for example the nucleus<br>
ventralis intermedius thalami.<br>
In the case of dystonia and choreoathetosis the globus pallidum internum,<br>
in the case of epilepsy the nucleus subthalamicus, the cerebellum, thalamic<br>
core regions, for example the nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami, or the<br>
nucleus caudatus.<br>
In the case of compulsion disorders, the capsula interna or the nucleus<br>
accumbens.<br>
By way of example, the target areas listed above for the respective<br>
illnesses may be chosen for the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Because either no calibration is required or the calibration can be carried<br><br><br>
out very quickly for the apparatus according to the invention, this makes it<br>
possible to test alternative target areas in the course of the electrode<br>
implantation process, for which the desynchronizing effect of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention may turn out to be even better.<br>
The invention likewise covers a controller which controls the described<br>
method of operation of the apparatus according to the invention, as well as<br>
the use of the apparatus and of the controller for the treatment of illnesses<br>
including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, compulsion<br>
disorders, choreoathetosis, tremor in the case of multiple sclerosis, tremor<br>
as a consequence of a stroke or of some other tissue damage, for example<br>
tumorous tissue damage, for example in the area of the thalamus and/or<br>
the basal ganglia, and epilepsy.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention can be used both as an implant<br>
for permanent therapy for the above-mentioned neurological and<br>
psychiatric illnesses and for intraoperative target point diagnosis, that is to<br>
say intraoperative finding of the optimum target point for the electrode<br>
implantation.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
AN APPARATUS FOR DESYNCHRONIZATION<br>
OF NEURAL BRAIN ACTIVITY<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for desynchronization of<br>
neural, illness-synchronous brain activity in which, according to the<br>
invention, the activities in at least two subareas of a brain area or at least<br>
two functionally associated brain areas are stimulated by means of at least<br>
two electrodes, on the basis of which, in the case of a person with an<br>
illness, desynchronization surprisingly occurs in the relevant neuron<br>
population and the symptoms are suppressed. The feedback stimulation<br>
signal, that is to say the measured, time-delayed and process neural<br>
activity, is used as an individual stimulus. In consequence, this results in<br>
demand control, which is self-regulating according to the invention, of the<br>
amplitude of the stimulation signal thus minimizing the intensity of the<br>
stimulation stimuli automatically after successful desynchronization. For<br>
successful operation, the apparatus requires neither complex calibration<br>
nor control of the stimulation parameters and, instead, these can preferably<br>
be adapted and optimized by the additional controller. The apparatus has<br>
at least two stimulation electrodes (2) and at least one sensor (3), which<br>
are driven by a controller such that they result in desynchronization in their<br>
local environment.</td>
