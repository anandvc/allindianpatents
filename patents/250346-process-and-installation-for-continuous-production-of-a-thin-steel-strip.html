				<td>The present invention relates to a Process and Installation for continuous production of a thin steel strip.<br>
The invention relates to a process and to an installation for the continuous production of a thin steel strip, having at least two casting rolls and   if appropriate laterally arranged side plates, it being possible for a casting reservoir, from which liquid steel melt can be. introduced to the casting rolls, to form between the casting rolls and the side plates during operation.<br>
During the production of a steel strip from a steel melt comprising at least the following alloying constituents:<br>
•	less than 1% by weight of Ni<br>
•	less than 1% by weight of Cr.<br>
•	less than 0.8% by weight of C,  in particular less than 0.4% by weight of C<br>
•	at least 0.55% by weight of Mn<br>
the casting strip produced, in particular when the two-roll casting process which is known from the prior art is used, has many cracks and surface defects, which significantly reduce the quality of the steel strip produced.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid these known drawbacks of the prior art and to further develop a process for the steel grades defined in Claim 1 and an installation in accordance with the preamble of Claim 19, in such a manner that it is possible to produce a corresponding steel strip more economically.<br><br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a process having the features of Claim 1 and by an installation having the features of Claim 19.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the casting rolls referred to are the casting rolls used in a two-roll casting process. In addition, however, the term casting roll by definition also encompasses all other shaping wall surfaces which are known from the prior art. According to the prior art, the surface of a casting roll is preferably produced by a process engineering technique which involves material-removing machining, in particular by turning and/or grinding. During the production of strips using the casting rolls which are known from the prior art, in particular in accordance with the two-roll casting process, and with RSF values of between 100 N/mm and 250 N/mm (roll separating force) which are customary in the prior art, the strips produced, in addition to significant evidence of cracking, also show evidence of very considerable temperature differences across the strip width and along the strip length, from which considerable fluctuations in forces and uneven solidification characteristics can be inferred.<br>
During the direct casting of non-stainless (Cr and/or Ni content in each case below 1%) liquid steel to form thin strips with a thickness of between 1 and 10 mm, use of the process parameters which are known from the prior art therefore produces a steel strip of" inadequate quality. In this context, microcracks which are frequently formed on the strip are particularly critical.<br>
The procedure described in the present invention has for  the  first  time  made  it  possible,  with  the abovementioned  composition  of  the  steel  melt,  to produce a crack-free strip with a good strip profile, in particular a good strip crown. Furthermore, it is<br><br>
possible to achieve a strip temperature across the width of the strip which is more homogenous than in the prior art even just below the permanent mould or casting rolls, in particular within a strip width, of ± 25 K. The strip produced using the process according to the invention does not generally have any thermally induced diagonal streaks and is distinguished by a good quality of its edges.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, there are two casting rolls for operating a two-roll casting process, in which case recesses which are distributed in a random pattern uniformly over the casting roll surface are arranged on the surfaces of both casting rolls.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the surface structure of the casting roll used is characterized by substantially uniformly distributed recesses. According to one particular embodiment, these recesses are indentations and/or protuberances, produced mechanically, for example, in the surface of the casting roll, with a height distance of 3 to 80 micrometres, in particular from 20 to 40 micrometres, being set between the rim, in particular the burr, and the deepest point of a recess.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, between 1 and 2 0 recesses per mm2 of the casting roll surface area are arranged on the casting roll surface in a random pattern, distributed uniformly „ over the casting roll surface.<br>
As tests have shown, this inventive measure makes it possible to produce a particularly high-quality surface of the steel strip.<br><br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the Si content of the steel melt is set to less than 0.35% by weight of Si.<br>
As tests have shown, this inventive measure makes it possible to produce a steel strip with particularly high-quality mechanical properties, in particular with an improved toughness.<br>
According to one embodiment"of the process according to the invention, the at least partially solidified casting strip is taken off the casting rolls at a rate of more than 30 m/min.<br>
In practice, it has been found that this inventive measure makes it possible to realize a particularly high-quality surface, combined at the same time with improved process economics. At lower rates, overflows and the formation of creases in the strip surface (often associated with surface cracks) are observed with increasing regularity.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the roughness average of the surface of at least one of the casting rolls is set to more than 3 \xra, with the stochastic distribution of the recesses being effected by a mechanical treatment of the casting roll surface, in particular by shot peening.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the mechanical treatment of the casting roll surface is carried out by shot peening using shot with a target diameter D in the range from 0.5 mm to 2.2 mm, with from 1 to 250 individual pieces of shot per mm2 of surface area striking the region of the surface which is subjected to the shot peening during this operation.<br><br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the pieces of shot used for shot peening deviate from the abovementioned target diameter D at most by a maximum standard deviation of 30%.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the liquid steel meniscus (= casting level) is oriented at an angle of between 30° and 50° from the geometric kissing point, i.e. the radii running from the casting roll axis on the one hand horizontally towards the geometric kissing point and on the other hand towards the meniscus include a steel bath contact angle of 30° - 50°.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the melt reservoir is laterally delimited by the two casting rolls and by suitable side plates and is at least partially covered at the top by a suitable covering, so that it is substantially protected from the ingress of media which do not form part of the process, in particular dust-containing air and/or oxidizing gases.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the melt reservoir is exposed to a substantially inert atmosphere, the inert gas supplied being formed by 0 - 100% by volume of N2/ remainder argon or another ideal gas or CO2 •<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the process according to the invention, the inert gas supplied contains up to 7% of H2.<br>

•	a strip crown of between 2 0 µm  and 150 Jim and<br>
•	an edge drop in the strip thickness between the edge of the strip and a distance of 40 mm from the edge of the strip of less than 150 µm<br>
are set for the steel strip as it leaves the permanent mould.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, during casting the hot profile of the casting rolls is set by one or more suitable actuators at the casting rolls, as a function of one or more of the following casting parameters:<br>
•	gas composition<br>
•	strip thickness<br>
•	solidification heat produced<br>
• casting rate<br><br>

edge of the strip and a distance of 40 mm from<br>
the edge of the strip of less than 150 µm<br>
are achieved in the steel strip as it leaves the permanent mould.<br>
Tests have shown that this inventive measure, continuing to take account of the roll separating force RSF, makes it possible to achieve a degree of solidification which is sufficiently uniform over the width of the casting strip, in particular including in the region of the strip edges, and thereby to further increase the efficiency of the proposed process according to the invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, a strip crown of between 30 µm and 90 µm and an edge drop of less than 100 µm are set in the casting strip.<br>

According  to  one  particular  embodiment  of  the invention, during the continuous production of strip in a two-roll casting device, liquid steel is introduced between two horizontally arranged casting rolls which rotate in opposite directions and have a  suitable cooling device,  in particular arranged in the rolls, especially water  cooling.  The  liquid metal  rapidly forms a solidified shell on contact with the cooled casting rolls,  the solidified shells being at least' partially pressed together under low roll separating forces at the location of the geometric "kissing point" between the casting surfaces (location of the shortest distance between the casting surfaces). The solidified strand or solidified strip is taken off beneath the kissing point.<br>
According to various embodiments of the invention, the liquid metal can be cast out of a ladle into a smaller vessel, from which it is cast, via a suitable casting nozzle, into the strip-casting installation or into the space above the kissing point between the two casting rolls. According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the metal which has been introduced forms a melt reservoir above the kissing point, which is delimited on the one hand by the surfaces of the casting roll and on the other hand by suitable side plates or other suitable devices, for example suitable electromagnetic  devices.  According  to  a  preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the side plates are designed to be moveable.<br>
The invention is explained in non-limiting fashion below, in accordance with a particular embodiment, with reference to diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus and a process for producing a thin steel strip in accordance with the invention<br>
Fig. 2 shows a detail of an apparatus and a process for producing a thin steel strip in accordance with the invention.<br>
The casting and rolling apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1 has a strip-casting installation 1 comprising a casting ladle 2 with a casting nozzle 3 and two oppositely rotating casting rolls 4, 5. The casting strip 6 is conveyed via a cooling section 7 to a rolling stand 8. In the rolling stand 8,  the thickness of the metal-strip is reduced by at least 10%. The strip which has been rolled in this way is conveyed through a holding and/or heating device 9 and is coiled at a coiler 10. According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the coiled strip is heat-treated in a suitable heat-treatment installation (not shown).<br>
The definition of the meniscus angle a can be seen from Fig. 2. The meniscus angle a is determined on the-basis of a normal section (plane perpendicular to the centre axis of the casting roll) between the connection<br>
•	of the point of contact of the casting level with the outer circumference of the casting roll and the<br>
•	centre point of the casting roll<br><br>
and the connection<br>
•	between the centre point of the casting roll and the<br>
•	centre point of the further casting roll.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the meniscus angle is measured, for example, by determining the height of the casting level.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
