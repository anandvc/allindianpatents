				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to gypsum panels and, more particularly, to gypsum<br>
panels having at least one surface faced with a fibrous mat adhered to a set gypsum<br>
core, wherein the surface of the fibrous mat has a coating of a moisture resistant,<br>
radiation-cured, e.g., UV-cured, polymer coating. The present invention also relates<br>
to the method of making such a gypsum panel structure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Panels of gypsum wallboard having a core of set gypsum sandwiched between two<br>
sheets of facing paper have long been used as structural members in the fabrication of<br>
buildings. Such panels are typically used to form the partitions or walls of rooms,<br>
elevator shafts, stairwells, ceilings and the like. Paper facing provides a smooth<br>
surface that is especially desirable for painting or wall papering interior walls.<br>
Although paper is a relatively inexpensive facing material and is easily used in the<br>
process of manufacturing wallboard, it has certain disadvantages, particularly with<br>
regard to durability and moisture-resistance.<br>
As an alternative to paper facing, other fibrous mats (such as glass fiber mats) also<br>
have been used as facing materials for gypsum wallboard. One example of such a<br>
wallboard is described in U.S. Patent 3,993,822. Fibrous glass matting provides<br>
improved water resistance and often provides significant improvements in strength<br>
and other structural attributes. More recently, fibrous glass mats having various types<br>
of coatings also have found acceptance for use in applications requiring moisture<br>
resistance.<br>
One specialty application for the use of panels of gypsum wallboard of this<br>
construction is in bathrooms-typically a place of high humidity and residual water<br>
because of the flow of water from the use of showers, bathtubs, and sinks. Gypsum<br>
wallboards suitable for use in these applications share a common requirement; that is<br>
a resistance or tolerance to high humidity and high moisture environments, often for<br>
prolonged periods.<br>
A usual construction of bathroom walls includes a multi-ply structure of ceramic tile<br>
adhered to an underlying base member, for example, a panel of wallboard comprising<br>
gypsum or other material. Such a panel is referred to in the industry as a "tile backing<br>
board," which for convenience is referred to herein as "tile backer". In usual fashion,<br>
sheets of tile backer (for example, 4' x 8' x 1/2") are fastened by rust-resistant nails or<br>
screws to studs. Blocks of ceramic tiles (for example, 4" x 4") are adhered to the<br>
sheets of tile backer using a water-resistant adhesive which is referred to in the<br>
industry as "mastic" or by a Portland cement-based adhesive which is referred to<br>
commonly as "thin set mortar". Thereafter, spaces between the tiles and between the<br>
tiles and other adjoining surfaces, for example, the lip of a bathtub or sink, are filled<br>
with a water-resistant material which is referred to in the industry as "grouting".<br>
It should be appreciated that a primary goal in constructing a bathroom that includes<br>
one or more of a bathtub, shower and sink is to make the contiguous and adjacent<br>
walls water-tight utilizing materials that resist being degraded by water, including hot<br>
water. Tiles made from ceramics are such materials and are basically inert to both the<br>
hot and cold water with which the tiles come into direct contact.<br>
It is important also that the tile backer to which the tiles are adhered be waterresistant.<br>
Theoretically, it would seem that the water-resistant properties of the tile<br>
backer should be inconsequential because the backer is shielded from shower, bath<br>
and sink water by water-resistant tiles, grouting and mastic. However, experience has<br>
shown this is not the case and that moisture can and does in fact seep, in various<br>
ways, through the plies of material which overlie the tile backer.<br>
One way has to do with the fact that grouting is not water-impervious and over time<br>
permits the seepage of moisture, a situation which is aggravated upon the formation of<br>
cracks, including hairline cracks, in the grouting. Eventually, the moisture which<br>
penetrates through the grouting finds its way through the mastic and comes into<br>
contact with the facing of the wallboard. Such facing is generally paper, typically a<br>
multi-ply paper, which upon contact with moisture tends to degrade by delaminating<br>
or otherwise deteriorating. For example, the paper facing may be subject to biological<br>
degradation from mold and mildew. The paper can actually rot away. Furthermore,<br>
as the moisture comes into contact with the underlying set gypsum core, it tends to<br>
dissolve the set gypsum and also the core adhesive, which bonds the core and paper<br>
facing together. Such adhesive is typically a starch material. The development of<br>
these conditions can lead to tiles coming loose from the underlying deteriorated<br>
paper-faced gypsum wallboard. This undesirable situation is exacerbated when hot<br>
water comes into contact with the paper-faced wallboard.<br>
Another type of moisture condition which leads to the loosening or falling off of tiles<br>
from their underlying support substrate is associated with those segments of the multiply<br>
wall structure which include a joint formed from an edge portion of the wallboard.<br>
An example is the joint formed by the edge of a wallboard panel and the lip of a<br>
bathtub. Another example is the joint formed by two contiguous wallboard panels.<br>
As moisture penetrates through the multi-ply structure and reaches such a joint, it<br>
tends to wet significant portions of the paper facing and core by virtue of its spreading<br>
through capillary action. This can lead to delamination of the paper facing and/or<br>
dissolution of the core and/or the paper/core adhesive. As this occurs, tiles can come<br>
loose and fall off.<br>
One water-resistant gypsum panel suitable for use in such moisture-prone conditions<br>
is described in U.S. Patents 5,397,631 and 5,552,187. According to these patents,<br>
following the manufacture of a fibrous glass mat-faced gypsum panel, a surface of the<br>
panel faced with a glass mat is coated with a substantially humidity- and waterresistant<br>
resinous coating of a cured (dried) latex polymer. The coating acts as both a<br>
liquid and vapor barrier and is formed from an aqueous coating composition<br>
comprising from about 15 to about 35 wt. % of resin solids, about 20 to about 65 wt.<br>
% of filler, and about 15 to about 45 wt. % of water, applied to obtain a solids loading<br>
of about 110 Ibs. per 1000 sq. ft. A preferred resin for use according to this patent is<br>
a latex polymer that has been sold by Unocal Chemicals Division of Unocal<br>
Corporation under the mark 76 RES 1018. The resin is a styrene-acrylic copolymer<br>
that has a relatively low film-forming temperature. Aqueous coatings formed from<br>
the resin are dried effectively at temperatures within the range of about 300° to 400° F.<br>
If desired, a coalescing agent can be used to lower the film-forming temperature of<br>
the resin.<br>
While this approach produces a gypsum panel that satisfactorily solves many of the<br>
previous-mentioned problems encountered when using paper-faced gypsum panels in<br>
severe moisture environments, the added cost, due both to the cost of the resinous<br>
coating itself and the cost associated with how the coating is applied, has been an<br>
impediment to wider use of such panels.<br>
One important embodiment of the present invention thus relates to an improved<br>
gypsum-based structural panel having a water impervious coating, such that the panel<br>
can be used effectively as a tile backer. Still other embodiments of the improved<br>
gypsum panel may have use in other applications such as in the return air<br>
installations, shaft walls and area separator walls in commercial buildings where<br>
water and humid conditions are commonly encountered. Other applications where<br>
moisture and humid conditions are likely to present difficulties either during the<br>
installation or the use of the board also will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
V<br>
These and other embodiments of the invention, which relies on the provision of a<br>
radiation cured, e.g., ultraviolet (UV) cured, coating on a fibrous mat faced gypsum<br>
panel, will be apparent from the following description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention is directed to a fibrous mat faced gypsum panel<br>
having on at least one of the facing sheets a moisture resistant, cured coating of a<br>
radiation curable, e.g., UV curable, polymer.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of preparing a fibrous<br>
mat-faced gypsum panel having the cured coating of a radiation curable, e.g., UV<br>
curable, polymer on at least one of the fibrous facing sheets.<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention is directed to a fibrous mat faced gypsum<br>
panel having on at least one of the facing sheets a moisture resistant cured coating of a<br>
radiation curable, e.g., UV curable, polymer and an aggregate material sufficient to<br>
facilitate the bonding of tiles or other decorative surface treatments to the gypsum<br>
panel.<br>
The cured coating provides excellent water resistance and vapor barrier properties. It<br>
also improves the durability of the surface conferring excellent abuse resistance and<br>
abrasion/scratch resistance to the coated surface. In roofing applications, the coating<br>
significantly reduces frothing often encountered when using gypsum panels in hotmop<br>
roofing installations. Coatings containing the aggregate additive also show excellent<br>
adhesion for tile setting materials such as mortars, mastics and epoxies, yet also having<br>
exceptional resistance to blocking.<br>
The present invention is particularly advantageous for use in applications in which the<br>
gypsum panel is expected to be exposed to a high humidity or high moisture environment<br>
during installation or use, such as in shaft walls, stairwells, area separation walls, return<br>
air installations and especially as a tile backer in bathroom applications. Still other<br>
applications and uses will become apparent from the detailed description of the invention,<br>
which appears hereinafter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a gypsum panel comprising:<br>
(a) a gypsum core having a planar first face and a planar second face;<br>
(b) a fibrous facing material adhered at least to the first face by gypsum in the gypsum<br>
core obtained from step (a) at least partially penetrating into the said fibrous<br>
material;<br>
(c) a high energy radiation cured coating of a radiation curable formulation on the<br>
fibrous facing material obtained from step (b), wherein the radiation curable<br>
formulation comprises at least one high energy radiation curable polymer having<br>
ethylenically unsaturated double bonds, and at least one high energy radiation<br>
curable reactive diluents; and<br>
(d) an aggregate material on and /or in the high energy radiation cured coating of step<br>
(c).<br>
As shown in Figure 1, one embodiment of a moisture-resistant gypsum panel or gypsum<br>
board of the present invention 10, having a radiation (UV) cured polymer coating 15<br>
comprises a gypsum board core 12 faced with two fibrous facing sheets or mats, 14 and<br>
16. Both of the fibrous facing sheets or mats may be glass fiber mats, both may be mats<br>
of paper fibers, or one may be a paper mat and the other a glass mat. Other fibrous mats<br>
suitable for use in the present invention will be apparent from the following description.<br>
For example, pre-coated glass fiber mats, such as described in U.S. Pat. Pub.<br>
20030203191 and U.S. Pat. Pub. 20020134079 can advantageously be used as well. The<br>
surface of at least one of the mats, preferably a fibrous glass mat in the case where the<br>
panel is designed for use in a high moisture environment, is coated with a radiation-cured,<br>
e.g., UV-cured, polymer coating (indicated by the numeral 15 in Figures 1 and 2).<br>
The radiation cured coating is applied using a formulation that preferably is essentially<br>
free of any unreactive components. The coating is typically applied following the initial<br>
preparation of the panel and the coated panel then is exposed to a radiation (UV) source to<br>
cure the coating on the fibrous facing sheet.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the gypsum panel is initially prepared using, as at least one<br>
of the facing sheets, a pre-coated glass mat having a dried (heat cured) aqueous coating<br>
composition containing a combination (e.g., a mixture) of a mineral pigment (filler); a first<br>
binder of a polymer latex adhesive and, optionally a second binder of an inorganic<br>
adhesive. Such a construction is described, for example, in co-pending U.S. application<br>
Serial No. 09/837,226 filed April 19, 2001, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Following initial preparation of the gypsum panel, the radiation curable formulation (e.g.,<br>
UV curable formulation) then is applied as a coating onto the pre-coated mat side of the<br>
gypsum panel and exposed to a radiation (UV) source to effect cure of the radiation (UV)<br>
curable coating.<br>
There are numerous advantages associated with the use of the present invention. Of<br>
primary importance is that the radiation cured polymer-coated fibrous mat-faced panel has<br>
superior weathering characteristics, and accordingly, can be used effectively for indefinite<br>
periods of time as a stable substrate in applications involving water contact and high<br>
humidity exposure, either in the initial installation of the panel or during its use. A<br>
radiation-cured polymer-coated glass mat-faced panel of the present invention is moldresistant<br>
and rot-resistant.<br>
The cured coating provides excellent water resistance and vapor barrier properties. It also<br>
improves the durability of the surface conferring excellent abuse resistance and<br>
abrasion/scratch resistance to the coated surface. In roofing applications, the coating<br>
significantly reduces frothing often encountered when using gypsum panels in hotmop<br>
roofing installations. Coatings containing an aggregate additive also show<br>
excellent adhesion for tile setting materials such as mortars, mastics and epoxies, yet<br>
also exhibit exceptional resistance to blocking.<br>
Gypsum board is typically manufactured by a method that includes dispersing a<br>
gypsum slurry onto a moving sheet of fibrous facer. The fibrous facer typically is<br>
supported by equipment such as forming tables, support belts, carrier rolls and/or the<br>
like. Usually a second sheet of fibrous facer is then fed from a roll onto the top of the<br>
slurry, thereby sandwiching the slurry between two moving fibrous facer sheets.<br>
Forming or shaping equipment is utilized to compress the slurry to the desired<br>
thickness. The gypsum slurry is allowed to at least partially set and then sequential<br>
lengths of board are cut and further processed by exposure to heat, which accelerates<br>
the drying of the board by increasing the rate of evaporation of excess water from the<br>
gypsum slurry.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic drawing of a portion of a manufacturing line for producing<br>
gypsum panels. The specific details of such a configuration are conventional and thus<br>
are provided only by a schematic representation. In conventional fashion, dry<br>
ingredients from which the gypsum core is formed are pre-mixed and then fed to a<br>
mixer of the type commonly referred to as a pin mixer (not shown). Water and other<br>
liquid constituents, such as soap, used in making the core are metered into the pin<br>
mixer where they are combined with the desired dry ingredients to form an aqueous<br>
gypsum slurry 41, which emerges from a discharge conduit 40 of the pin mixer.<br>
Foam (soap) is generally added to the slurry to control the density of the resulting<br>
core. The slurry is deposited through one or more outlets of the discharge conduit 40<br>
onto a horizontally moving continuous web of fibrous facing material 24 (such as<br>
multi-ply papers or a pre-coated fibrous glass mat). The amount deposited can be<br>
controlled in manners known in the art.<br>
Fibrous facing material 24 is fed from a roll (not shown), and if pre-coated, with the<br>
coated side down. Prior to receiving the gypsum slurry 41, the web of fibrous facing<br>
material 24 is flattened by rollers (not shown) and usually is scored by one or more<br>
scoring devices (not shown). Scoring allows the sides of fibrous facing material 24 to<br>
be folded upward and around the edges of the gypsum panel. Fibrous facing material<br>
24 and the deposited gypsum slurry 41 move in the direction of arrow B. The moving<br>
web of fibrous facing material 24 will form the second facing sheet of the panel being<br>
fabricated, and the slurry at least partially (and preferably, only partially) penetrates<br>
into the thickness of the fibrous facing material and sets. On setting, a strong<br>
adherent bond is formed between the set gypsum and the fibrous facing sheet. The<br>
partial penetration of the slurry into the fibrous facing sheet can be controlled<br>
according to methods known in the art such as, for example, controlling the viscosity<br>
of the slurry and by applying various coatings to the fibrous facing.<br>
The gypsum core of the panel of the present invention is basically of the type used in<br>
gypsum structural products commonly known as gypsum wallboard, dry wall, gypsum<br>
board, gypsum lath and gypsum sheathing. The core of such a product is formed by<br>
mixing water with powdered anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
(CaSCVl/l t^O), also known as calcined gypsum, to form an aqueous<br>
gypsum slurry, and thereafter allowing the slurry mixture to hydrate or set into<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSCV2 H20), a relatively hard material. The core of the<br>
product will in general comprise at least about 75-85wt% of set gypsum, though the<br>
invention is not limited to any particular content of gypsum in the core.<br>
After the gypsum slurry 41 is deposited upon the web of fibrous facing mat material<br>
24, the edges of that web are progressively folded (using equipment well-known to<br>
those skilled in the art) around the edges of the forming panel or wallboard, and<br>
terminate on the upper surface of the slurry along the sides. Another web of fibrous<br>
facing material, e.g., paper 22, fed in the direction of arrow C from a roll (not shown),<br>
usually is applied to the upper surface of the gypsum slurry 41, and usually only<br>
slightly overlaps the folded-around edges of the (bottom) web of fibrous facing<br>
material 24. Of course, any facing sheet suitable for use a facing sheet 24 can also be<br>
used for facing sheet 22. Prior to applying the (top) web of fibrous facing material,<br>
such as paper 22, to the upper surface of the gypsum slurry, glue is applied to the web<br>
along portions of the web that will overlap and be in contact with the folded-over<br>
edges of the bottom fibrous facing sheet (glue application is not shown). Preferably<br>
non-starch-based glues are used. One suitable glue is a poly(vinyl alcohol) latex glue.<br>
Glues based on vinyl acetate polymers, especially vinyl acetate that has been<br>
hydrolyzed to form a polyvinyl alcohol, are widely available commercially as white<br>
glues. Various configurations may be used for feeding and joining the webs.<br>
After the (top) web of facing material, such as paper 22, is applied, the "sandwich" of<br>
fibrous facing material web, gypsum slurry and second fibrous facing material web<br>
are pressed to the desired wallboard thickness between plates 50 and 52.<br>
Alternatively, the webs and slurry can be pressed to the desired thickness with rollers<br>
or in another manner. The continuous sandwich of slurry and applied facing materials<br>
then is carried by conveyor(s) 54 in the direction of arrow D. Slurry 41 sets as it is<br>
carried along.<br>
As noted above, the gypsum panel of the present invention is faced with at least one<br>
and preferably a second facer sheet of a fibrous mat. A suitable fibrous mat<br>
comprises a mat of fibrous material that is capable of forming a strong bond with the<br>
set gypsum comprising the core of the gypsum wallboard. Non-limiting examples of<br>
such fibrous mats are mats made from (1) paper (cellulose) fibers (2) mineral-type<br>
materials such as glass fibers, (3) synthetic resin fibers, such as polyolefm fibers and<br>
(4) blends of fibers, such as blends of mineral fibers and synthetic resin fibers. Glass<br>
fiber mats are normally preferred for panels that are slated to be used in severe<br>
moisture environments. Fibrous mats based on paper fibers generally consist of<br>
multi-ply constructions, while glass fiber mats are often of a single-ply construction.<br>
As noted above, either or both of the facer sheets can be a paper facer sheet, a fibrous<br>
glass mat facer sheet, a fibrous synthetic resin mat facer sheet, or a facer sheet made<br>
from a blend of fibers, such as a blend of glass and synthetic resin fibers. Preferably,<br>
for high moisture applications, at least one of the facer sheets is a fibrous glass mat<br>
facer sheet and more preferably a pre-coated fibrous glass mat, such as the pre-coated<br>
mat disclosed in co-pending application Serial No. 837,226. Thus, in some of the<br>
contemplated embodiments of the present invention the gypsum panel can have, by<br>
way of example, a set gypsum core covered by two paper facers, two fibrous glass<br>
mat facers, or one paper facer and one fibrous glass mat facer. The terms "first facer"<br>
and "second facer" are arbitrary in that each term can refer either to a top layer or a<br>
backing layer of the gypsum panel.<br>
Suitable facer sheets made from paper fibers include those commonly used for the<br>
face sheet of conventional wallboard products. Such paper products are well known<br>
to those skilled in the art. One example of a suitable paper facer sheet is an ivory<br>
paper (multi-ply) having hard internal sizing (100% through) of 1000 to 3500; a basis<br>
weight of about 54 to 56 pounds per 1000 square feet; an overall caliper of about .013<br>
inches; a tensile strength of about 70 Ibs/inch (machine direction) and about 23 Ibs/<br>
inch (cross direction); a top liner Cobb surface wetting of about 1.00 to about 1.50<br>
grams and bottom liner Cobb surface wetting of about 0.50 to about 1.50 grams; and a<br>
porosity of about 15 sec. to about 150 sec. Other suitable papers for making gypsum<br>
wallboard are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable fibrous mats, made in part from mineral fibers and/or synthetic resin fibers,<br>
can comprise continuous or discrete strands or fibers and can be woven or nonwoven<br>
in form. Such constructions are commercially available.<br>
Nonwoven glass mats such as made from chopped strands and continuous strands can<br>
be used satisfactorily and are less costly than woven materials. The strands of such<br>
glass mats typically are bonded together to form a unitary structure by a suitable<br>
adhesive. A glass fiber mat can range in thickness, for example, from about 10 to<br>
about 40 mils, with a mat thickness of about 15 to about 35 mils generally being<br>
suitable. The aforementioned fibrous glass mats are known and are commercially<br>
available in many forms. While nonwoven fibrous mats will often be preferred<br>
because of their lower cost, woven fibrous mats may be desirable in certain<br>
specialized instances and thus also are contemplated for use in connection with the<br>
present invention.<br>
One suitable fibrous glass mat is a fiberglass mat comprising chopped, nonwoven,<br>
fiberglass filaments oriented in a random pattern and bound together with a resin<br>
binder, typically a urea-formaldehyde-based resin adhesive. Fiber glass mats of this<br>
type are commercially available, for example, such as those which have been sold<br>
under the trademark DURA-GLASS by Manville Building Materials Corporation and<br>
those which have been sold by Elk Corporation as BUR or shingle mat. An example<br>
of such a mat is nominally 33 mils thick and incorporates glass fibers about 13 to 16<br>
microns in diameter. Although certain structural applications may utilize a thicker<br>
mat and thicker fibers, a glass fiber mat nominally 20 mils thick, which includes glass<br>
fibers about 10 microns in diameter, is also suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
Glass mats suitable for use in the present invention have a basis weight that is usually<br>
between about 10 and 30 Ibs. per thousand square feet of mat surface area.<br>
Typically, but not exclusively, glass fiber mats are wet-formed into a continuous nonwoven<br>
web of any workable width on a Fourdrinier-type machine. Preferably, an<br>
upwardly inclining wire having several linear feet of very dilute stock lay-down,<br>
followed by several linear feet of high vacuum water removal, is used. This is<br>
followed by a "curtain coater," which applies the glass fiber binder and an oven that<br>
removes excess water and cures the adhesive to form a coherent mat structure.<br>
After being formed and sufficiently set, the wallboard is typically cut to desired<br>
lengths and dried. The drying follows the initial hydration and is ultimately aided by<br>
heating, which causes excess water to evaporate through the fibrous facing sheets or<br>
mats as the calcined gypsum hydrates and sets. Thus, the fibrous facing sheets or<br>
mats must be sufficiently porous to permit the passage of water vapor at this stage<br>
required for adequate drying. Drying conditions typically used in conventional<br>
continuous gypsum board manufacture include temperatures of about 200° to about<br>
600° F., with drying times of about 30 to about 60 minutes, at line speeds of about 70<br>
to about 600 linear feet per minute. Of course, any combination of drying time and<br>
drying temperature for obtaining a suitable gypsum board product can be used and the<br>
above parameters are simply exemplary.<br>
After this initial preparation of the wallboard, the water-resistant coating is applied to<br>
at least one, or alternatively both of the faces of the wallboard.<br>
The resulting gypsum board is schematically illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The board<br>
has a set gypsum core 12 with the first 16 and second 14 fibrous facer sheets adhered<br>
thereto by the partially penetrating gypsum core. Generally, the core will have voids<br>
(shown as individual dots) distributed there through as a consequence of the foam<br>
added to the gypsum slurry during board manufacture to reduce its density.<br>
The composition from which the set gypsum core of the structural panel is made can<br>
include a variety of additives, such as set accelerators, set retardants, foaming agents,<br>
reinforcing fibers, and dispersing agents. In addition, a viscosity control agent may be<br>
added to adjust the viscosity of the slurry. Examples of viscosity control agents are<br>
described in U.S. Patent 4,647,496. Other typical additives include water-resistant<br>
additives and fire-resistant additives. A variety of additives for improving waterresistant<br>
properties of a gypsum core are described, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
5,342,680, including a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and a wax-asphalt emulsion. In<br>
one embodiment, described in more detail below, the water-resistance of the<br>
wallboard is such that it absorbs less than about 10%, preferably less than about 7.5%,<br>
and most preferably less than about 5% water when tested in accordance with the<br>
immersion test of ASTM method C-473.<br>
To reduce the weight (density) of the core, it also has been common practice to<br>
introduce small bubbles into the gypsum to produce a foamed gypsum core. Foaming<br>
agents or soaps, typically long-chained alkyl sulfonates, are conventionally added for<br>
this purpose. One adverse consequence of the normal addition of soaps into gypsum<br>
slurry is a reduction in the strength of the bond between the cured gypsum core and<br>
the paper facers. To counteract this effect, a starch binder normally is added to the<br>
gypsum slurry.<br>
More recently, improved gypsum wallboard constructions have been developed. In<br>
one approach, the gypsum board is prepared with a pre-coated glass fiber mat,<br>
wherein the coating comprises a dried aqueous mixture of a mineral pigment (filler); a<br>
first binder comprised of a polymer latex adhesive; and, optionally a second binder<br>
comprised of an inorganic adhesive. A wallboard of this type is described in pending<br>
U.S. Application Serial No. 09/837,226 filed on April 19, 2001, the entire disclosure<br>
of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In another construction, the gypsum<br>
core is covered with a glass fiber mat (preferably a pre-coated glass mat, such as<br>
described in the just-referenced application) on one face, and with a paper sheet on<br>
the opposite face. This wallboard is described in pending U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
107 245,505 filed on September 18, 2002, the entire disclosure of which also is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Wallboards may contain wax or a wax emulsion as an additive to improve the water<br>
resistance of the gypsum core. The invention is not limited thereby, however, and<br>
examples of other materials which have been reported as being effective for<br>
improving the water-resistant properties of gypsum products include metallic<br>
resinates; wax or asphalt or mixtures thereof, usually supplied as an emulsion; a<br>
mixture of wax and/or asphalt and also cornflower and potassium permanganate;<br>
water insoluble thermoplastic organic materials such as petroleum and natural asphalt,<br>
coal tar, and thermoplastic synthetic resins such as poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl<br>
chloride) and a copolymer of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride and acrylic resins; a<br>
mixture of metal rosin soap, a water soluble alkaline earth metal salt, and residual fuel<br>
oil; a mixture of petroleum wax in the form of an emulsion and either residual fuel oil,<br>
pine tar or coal tar; a mixture comprising residual fuel oil and rosin; aromatic<br>
isocyanates and diisocyanates; organohydrogen-polysiloxanes; siliconates, such as<br>
available from Dow Corning as Dow Corning 772; a wax emulsion and a wax-asphalt<br>
emulsion each with or without such materials as potassium sulfate, alkali and alkaline<br>
earth aluminates, and Portland cement; a wax-asphalt emulsion prepared by adding to<br>
a blend of molten wax and asphalt an oil-soluble, water-dispersing emulsifying agent,<br>
and admixing the aforementioned with a solution of casein which contains, as a<br>
dispersing agent, an alkali sulfonate of a polyarylmethylene condensation product.<br>
The siliconates are normally used in an amount of from about 0.05% to about 0.4%,<br>
more usually in an amount of about 0.1%. Mixtures of these additives can also be<br>
employed.<br>
Species of wax emulsions and wax-asphalt emulsions used to improve wallboard<br>
water resistance are commercially available. The wax portion of these emulsions is<br>
preferably a paraffin or microcrystalline wax, but other waxes also can be used. If<br>
asphalt is used, it in general should have a softening point of about 115° F, as<br>
determined by the ring and ball method. The total amount of wax and wax-asphalt in<br>
the aqueous emulsions will generally comprise about 50 to about 60 wt% of the<br>
aqueous emulsion. In the case of wax-asphalt emulsions, the weight ratio of asphalt<br>
to wax usually varies from about 1 to 1 to about 10 to 1. Various methods are known<br>
for preparing wax-asphalt emulsions, as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 3,935,021.<br>
Commercially available wax emulsions and wax-asphalt emulsions that can be used in<br>
the gypsum composition described herein have been sold by United States Gypsum<br>
Co. (Wax Emulsion), by Monsey Products (No. 52 Emulsion), by Douglas Oil Co.<br>
(Docal No. 1034), by Conoco (No. 7131 and Gypseal II) and by Monsey-Bakor<br>
(Aqualite 70). The amount of wax emulsion or wax-asphalt emulsion used to provide<br>
water resistant characteristics to the gypsum core often can be within the range of<br>
about 3 to about 10 wt%, preferably about 5 to about 7 wt%, based on the total weight<br>
of the ingredients of the composition from which the set gypsum core is made.<br>
Another water-resistant additive for use in the core of the gypsum-based core is an<br>
organopolysiloxane, for example, of the type referred to in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,455,710;<br>
3,623,895; 4,136,687; 4,447,498; and 4,643,771. One example of this type of<br>
additive is poly(methyl-hydrogen-siloxane). When used, the amount of the<br>
organopolysiloxane usually is at least about 0.2 wt% and often falls within the range<br>
of about 0.3 to about 0.6 wt%.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the term "wt%" as used herein in connection with the<br>
gypsum core means weight percent based on the total weight of the ingredients of the<br>
composition from which the set gypsum core is made, including any water of the wax<br>
or wax-asphalt emulsion, but not including additional amounts of water that are added<br>
to the gypsum composition for forming an aqueous slurry thereof.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, polyvmyl alcohol may used as a binder in an<br>
effective amount to promote adhesion between the set gypsum core and the adjacent<br>
facer sheet(s), avoiding the need to use in the gypsum core, starch or other<br>
conventional binders. This is described in co-pending U.S. application Serial No.<br>
10/224,591 filed on August 21, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference<br>
Typically, the core of the gypsum board has a density of about 35 to about 55 lbs./ft3,<br>
more usually about 40 to about 50 lbs./ft3. Of course, cores having both higher and<br>
lower densities can be used in particular applications if desired. The manufacture of<br>
cores of predetermined densities can be accomplished by using known techniques, for<br>
example, by introducing an appropriate amount of foam (soap) into the aqueous<br>
gypsum slurry from which the core is formed or by molding.<br>
Radiation (e.g., UV) curable formulations suitable for forming a liquid and vapor<br>
impervious coating of the present invention typically comprise at least one polymer<br>
which has ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. This polymer is generally<br>
supplied in an amount between about 20 and 99 wt.% of the total formulation weight.<br>
In addition, the formulation preferably is essentially free of any non-reactive (volatile)<br>
diluents or non-reactive solvents. In this way, there is no need to apply heat to the<br>
panel to remove non-reactive constituents from the coating during the curing step and<br>
essentially all of the radiation curable formulation becomes the radiation cured<br>
coating. As used in this specification and in the claims, the term "essentially free"<br>
means an amount of non-reactive components that constitutes such a small proportion<br>
of the radiation curable formulation that special provisions do not have to be provided<br>
for its removal (e.g., added heat to dry the coating) and by remaining in the coating,<br>
the desired properties of the coating are not adversely impacted.<br>
Productivity of a modern industrial process is very important. The almost<br>
instantaneous curing obtained by using a formulation that is essentially 100% nonvolatile<br>
also minimizes the time between application of the coating formulation and<br>
obtaining a coated gypsum panel that can be handled for inventory or distribution.<br>
This allows the gypsum panel to be coated on-line, shortly after exiting the<br>
conventional drying ovens.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the formulation is applied to at least one of<br>
the fibrous facing sheets or mats of the gypsum panel and then is cured by exposure to<br>
high-energy radiation, for example by irradiating with UV light of wavelength in the<br>
range from 250 to 400 nm or possibly in the alternative by irradiating with highenergy<br>
electrons (electron beams; from 100 to 350 keV). In some applications, heat<br>
may be sufficient to cause effective crosslinking of the reactive components of the<br>
formulation, or may be used in conjunction with the above-noted high-energy<br>
radiation..<br>
Polymers suitable for the radiation-curable formulation of the invention are, in<br>
principle, any polymer which has ethylenically unsaturated double bonds which can<br>
undergo free-radical polymerization on exposure to electromagnetic radiation, such as<br>
UV radiation or electron beams. As understood by those skilled in the art, the content<br>
of ethylenically unsaturated double bonds in the polymer must be sufficient to ensure<br>
effective crosslinking of the polymer. Generally, a content of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated double bonds in the range from 0.01 to 1.0 mol/100 g of polymer, usually<br>
from 0.05 to 0.8 mol/100 g of polymer and most often from 0.1 to 0.6 mol/100 g of<br>
polymer will be sufficient.<br>
As used throughout the specification and claims, the term "polymer" is intended to<br>
encompass materials containing ethylenically unsaturated double bonds commonly<br>
referred to in the art as polycondensates, polyaddition products, chemically modified<br>
polymers, oligomers and prepolymers. Suitable polymers often are obtained by<br>
reacting polyfunctional compounds having at least three reactive groups with other<br>
monofunctional or polyfunctional compounds, which can react with the<br>
polyfunctional compounds having at least three reactive groups, with one or more of<br>
the compounds having ethylenically unsaturated double bonds that remain after the<br>
reaction.<br>
Suitable polymers generally have acryloxy, methacryloxy, acrylamido or<br>
methacrylamido groups, which may be bonded to the backbone of the polymer<br>
directly or through an alkylene groups. Such polymers generally include silicones,<br>
polyurethanes, polyesters, polyethers, epoxy resins, melamine resins and<br>
(meth)acrylate-based polymers and copolymers, having in each case ethylenically<br>
unsaturated groups. Polymers having acryloxy and/or methacryloxy groups are most<br>
common. Such polymers often are called silicone acrylates, polyurethane acrylates,<br>
acrylate-modified polyesters or polyester acrylates, epoxy acrylates, polyether<br>
acrylates, melamine acrylates and acrylate-modified copolymers based on<br>
(meth)acrylates. It also is possible to use ethylenically unsaturated polyesters as the<br>
radiation curable polymer.<br>
The silicones having ethylenically unsaturated double bonds are generally linear or<br>
cyclic polydimethylsiloxanes that have allyl, methallyl, acryloyl or methacryloyl<br>
groups. The ethylenically unsaturated groups are bonded to the silicon atoms of the<br>
main backbone of the polydimethylsiloxane directly, via an oxygen atom, or via an<br>
alkylene group which is linear or branched and may be interrupted by one or more<br>
non-adjacent oxygen atoms. Acrylate and/or methacrylate groups are introduced into<br>
such silicones, for example, by esterifying Si-OH groups in the polydimethylsiloxanes<br>
with an appropriate acid chloride or an alkyl ester of the acid, for example the ethyl<br>
esters and methyl esters. Another method is to hydrosilylate the propynyl esters of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids with dimethylchlorosilane and then react<br>
the chloroorganosilicon compound obtained in this fashion with a<br>
polydimethylsiloxane containing hydroxyl groups. Another functionalization method<br>
starts from polydimethylsiloxanes which have an oo-chloroalkyl group on a silicon<br>
atom, for example 3-chloropropyl or 2-methyl-3-chloropropyl. Such compounds may<br>
be modified with ethylenically unsaturated compounds containing hydroxyl groups in<br>
the presence of suitable bases, for example tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, to<br>
give ethylenically unsaturated polysiloxanes. Examples of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compounds containing hydroxyl groups are the esters of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids with polyhydroxy compounds, eg. hydroxyalkyl acrylates and<br>
hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, such as hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl (meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane<br>
di(meth)acrylate and pentaerythritol di- or tri(meth)acrylate.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated silicones mentioned are well known to the person<br>
skilled in the art and are generally commercially available.<br>
Ethylenically unsaturated epoxy resin derivatives suitable for use in the radiation<br>
curable formulations encompass in particular the reaction products of epoxy-groupcontaining<br>
compounds or oligomers with ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic<br>
acids, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid and cinnamic acid. Instead<br>
of, or together with the monocarboxylic acids, it is also possible to use the monoesters<br>
of ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids with monoalcohols, such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, tert-butanol, n-hexanol and 2-<br>
ethylhexanol. Suitable epoxy-group-containing substrates encompass in particular the<br>
polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols. These include the diglycidyl ethers of<br>
bisphenol A and of its derivatives, and moreover the diglycidyl ethers of oligomers of<br>
bisphenol A, obtained by reacting bisphenol A with the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol<br>
A, and furthermore the polyglycidyl ethers of novolacs. The reaction products of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids with the glycidyl ethers under<br>
consideration may be modified with primary or secondary amines. It is moreover<br>
possible to introduce further ethylenically unsaturated groups into the epoxy resin by<br>
reaction of hydroxyl groups in epoxy resins with suitable derivatives of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids, eg. acid chlorides. Ethylenically unsaturated epoxy<br>
resins are well known to the person skilled in the art and are commercially available.<br>
Examples of ethylenically unsaturated melamine resins suitable as the radiation<br>
curable polymer are the reaction products of melamine-formaldehyde condensation<br>
products with compounds containing hydroxyl groups, with ethylenically unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic anhydrides, or with the amides of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids. Suitable melamine-formaldehyde condensation products are<br>
in particular hexamethylolmelamine (HMM) and hexamethoxymethylolmelamine<br>
(HMMM). Suitable hydroxyl-group-containing compounds encompass, for example,<br>
the hydroxyalkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, in particular of<br>
acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. Other possible compounds for the reaction with<br>
HMM are ethylenically unsaturated alcohols, such as allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol.<br>
Other suitable compounds for such reactions are ethylenically unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic anhydrides, such as maleic anhydride. It also is possible to modify either<br>
HMM or HMMM with the amides of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, eg.<br>
acrylamide or methacrylamide, to give ethylenically unsaturated melamine resins.<br>
Such melamine resins also are well known.<br>
Ethylenically unsaturated polymers suitable for preparing a radiation curable<br>
formulation for use in this invention may also include polyesters that contain<br>
ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. A distinction can be made here between,<br>
materials identified as ethylenically unsaturated polyesters which are obtained by<br>
copolycondensation of conventional dicarboxylic acids together with ethylenically<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and/or with anhydrides of these acids and with lowmolecular-<br>
weight diols, and on the other hand ethylenically modified polyesters<br>
obtained by derivatizing free hydroxyl groups in conventional polyesters. The<br>
hydroxyl groups may be derivatized separately or during the preparation of the<br>
hydroxyl group-containing polyester.<br>
Ethylenically unsaturated polyesters encompass in particular the copolycondensates of<br>
maleic anhydride with at least one other dicarboxylic acid and/or their anhydride(s)<br>
and a low-molecular-weight diol. In this case, the dicarboxylic acids and/or their<br>
anhydrides are preferably selected from the class consisting of succinic acid, succinic<br>
anhydride, glutaric acid, glutaric anhydride, adipic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic<br>
acid, isophthalic acid and in particular phthalic anhydride. Suitable diols can be<br>
selected from the class consisting of ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, neopentyl glycol and 1,6-hexanediol, in particular 1,2-<br>
propylene glycol.<br>
Suitable hydroxyl-group-containing polyesters for derivatization giving ethylenically<br>
modified polyesters may be prepared in a usual manner by polycondensation of di- or<br>
polybasic carboxylic acids with dihydric alcohols and/or at least one other polyhydric<br>
alcohol component. Possible di- or polybasic carboxylic acids in this case are<br>
aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids and their esters and anhydrides. These<br>
include succinic acid, succinic anhydride, glutaric acid, glutaric anhydride, adipic<br>
acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic<br>
anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic acid<br>
and pyromellitic anhydride. Examples of possible dihydric alcohols are ethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-<br>
hexanediol, 2-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 2-ethyl-1,4-butanediol, dimethylolcyclohexane,<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, mixtures of these, and also<br>
polyaddition polymers of cyclic ethers, such as polytetrahydrofuran, polyethylene<br>
glycol and polypropylene glycol. Possible polyhydric alcohols include tri- to<br>
hexahydric alcohols, such as glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane,<br>
trimethylolbutane, pentaerythritol, ditrimethylolpropane, sorbitol, erythritol and 1,3,5-<br>
trihydroxybenzene. If the total number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohol component<br>
molecule is larger than the total number of carboxyl groups in the acid component<br>
molecule, a hydroxyl-group-containing polyester is obtained. These hydroxyl groups<br>
may be esterified in a known manner by usual processes with the abovementioned<br>
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, in particular acrylic and methacrylic acids.<br>
The water formed during the esterification reaction may be removed, for example, by<br>
dehydrating agents, by extraction or by azeotropic distillation. The esterification<br>
usually takes place in the presence of a catalyst, eg. a strong acid, such as sulfuric<br>
acid, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, toluenesulfonic acid and/or acid ion exchangers.<br>
It also is possible to etherify the hydroxyl groups in the polyester with reactive,<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds, eg. with allyl chloride or methallyl chloride.<br>
Still another embodiment relates to polyesters made from diols, dicarboxylic acids<br>
and at least one carboxylic acid of higher basicity. In this case, the hydroxyl groups<br>
are introduced into the polyester subsequently by reacting the carboxylic acids groups<br>
with alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. These alcohol<br>
moieties may then be esterified or etherified in the same manner. These products are<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art and are commercially available. Their<br>
number-average molecular weight is generally in the range from 500 to 10,000 and<br>
more usually from 800 to 3,000.<br>
Other ethylenically modified polyesters that can be used to make the radiation curable<br>
formulation of the present invention are polyesters obtained by co-condensing<br>
conventional di- or polycarboxylic acids with conventional alcohol components along<br>
with ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, preferably acrylic and/or<br>
methacrylic acid. Such polymers are known, for example, from European Patent 279<br>
303, to which reference is hereby made for further details. In this case, the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated groups are introduced into the polyester during the<br>
construction of the polyester from its low-molecular-weight components.<br>
As noted above, the radiation curable polymer may also be selected from<br>
ethylenically unsaturated polyethers. Ethylenically unsaturated polyethers are<br>
prepared from a main structure of polyether to have terminal unsaturated groups. The<br>
main structure of a polyether is obtained, for example, by reacting a di- or polyhydric<br>
alcohol, for example an alcohol mentioned above as a di- or polyol component for<br>
preparing polyesters, with an epoxide, usually with ethylene oxide and/or propylene<br>
oxide. This main structure of polyether contains free hydroxyl groups, which may<br>
then be converted in the manner described above into allyl, methallyl, crotyl or<br>
phenylallyl groups or may be esterified with ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acids, in particular acrylic and/or methacrylic acid, or with suitable derivatives, such<br>
as acid chlorides, Ci -€4 -alkyl esters or anhydrides.<br>
The radiation curable polymer also may be an ethylenically unsaturated copolymer<br>
based on (meth)acrylates. Such ethylenically unsaturated copolymers are generally<br>
obtained by reacting a functionalized polymer, i.e. a polymer that has a free hydroxyl,<br>
carbonyl, carboxyl, isocyanate, amino and/or epoxy group. The ethylenic double<br>
bonds are generally introduced into the structure by reacting the polymer with a<br>
suitable, low-molecular-weight, ethylenically unsaturated compound which has a<br>
functional group which can react with the reactive group in the polymer, developing a<br>
covalent bond.<br>
The functionalized polymers used as a starting material for such polymers are<br>
generally obtained by free-radical polymerization of at least one ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer having a functional group of the type mentioned above and, if<br>
desired, other ethylenically unsaturated comonomers. The ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer with a functional group generally makes up from 5 to 50 mol %, more<br>
usually from 15 to 40 mol % and most often from 20 to 35 mol %, of the total<br>
monomers to be polymerized. Examples of monomers with a functional group are<br>
hydroxyalkyl acrylates and hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate and 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
aminoalkyl acrylates and aminoalkyl methacrylates, such as 2-aminoethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, carbonyl compounds, such as acrolein, methacrolein, vinyl ethyl<br>
ketone, N-diacetonacrylamide and -methacrylamide, vinyl isocyanate, dimethyl-3-<br>
isopropenylbenzyl isocyanate, 4-isocyanatostyrene, and isocyanates of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids, eg. methacryloyl isocyanate, co-isocyanatoalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylatee, glycidyl compounds, such as glycidyl allyl and glycidyl methallyl<br>
ethers, the glycidyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as<br>
glycidyl (meth)acrylate, ethylenically unsaturated anhydrides, such as maleic<br>
anhydride and methacrylic anhydride and the amides of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids, such as acrylamide and methacrylamide. Suitable comonomers are<br>
generally selected from the class consisting of esters of acrylic and of methacrylic<br>
acid and, if desired, vinylaromatic compounds. Examples of suitable comonomers are<br>
the Ci-C4 esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate and tert-butyl (meth)acrylate. Other suitable<br>
comonomers are styrene, 1-methylstyrene, 4-tert-butylstyrene and 2-chlorostyrene.<br>
To a lesser extent, it is also possible to use monomers such as vinyl acetate, vinyl<br>
propionate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, conjugated dienes, such as butadiene<br>
and isoprene, vinyl ethers of Ci-C2o alkanols, eg. vinyl isobutyl ether, acrylonitrile,<br>
methacrylonitrile and heterocyclic vinyl compounds, such as 2-vinylpyridine and Nvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
A well-known embodiment encompasses, as comonomers, at least<br>
one monomer selected from the class consisting of the esters of methacrylic acid, in<br>
particular methyl methacrylate, and at least one further comonomer, selected from the<br>
class consisting of the alkyl esters of acrylic acid, and/or styrene.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated compounds that have a functional group and are<br>
suitable for the above-described reaction are often selected from the abovementioned<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers with a functional group. A precondition is that<br>
the functionality of the ethylenically unsaturated compound be able to react with the<br>
functionalities on the polymer, with bond formation with the polymer. Suitable<br>
reactions are condensation and addition reactions. Examples of suitable functional<br>
interactions are isocyanate-hydroxyl, isocyanate-amino, anhydride-hydroxyl,<br>
anhydride-amino, carbonyl-amino, carboxylic acid chloride-hydroxyl, glycidylhydroxyl,<br>
glycidyl-amino or amide and glycidyl-carboxyl. In another well known<br>
embodiment, the ethylenically unsaturated polymer is obtained by reacting a<br>
functionalized polymer having glycidyl groups with ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compounds having hydroxyl groups, in particular the hydroxyalkyl esters of the<br>
abovementioned ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, eg. 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
acrylate. Examples of such ethylenically unsaturated polymers are found in European<br>
Patent 650 979, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another suitable type of polymer for use in the radiation curable formulation of the<br>
present invention are polyurethane derivatives having ethylenically unsaturated<br>
double bonds. Such polyurethanes can be obtained, for example, by reacting<br>
isocyanate-containing polyurethanes with ethylenically unsaturated compounds which<br>
themselves have at least one functional group reactive with the isocyanate moiety, for<br>
example primary or secondary amino or a hydroxyl. Examples of suitable<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds having an amino or hydroxyl group are, in<br>
particular, the abovementioned esterification products of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids with di- or polyols where at least one hydroxyl group remains<br>
unesterified. Examples of such compounds include, in particular hydroxyalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates, such as hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
butanediol mono(meth)acrylate, partial esterification products of polyhydric alcohols<br>
with acrylic and/or methacrylic acid, eg. trimethylolpropane mono- and<br>
di(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol di- and tri(meth)acrylate, and also the corresponding<br>
aminoalkyl esters and hydroxyalkylamides, such as Nhydroxyalkyl(<br>
meth)acrylamides and 3-aminoalkyl (meth)acrylates.<br>
Polyurethanes containing isocyanate groups can be obtained in the well-known<br>
manner by reacting aliphatic and/or aromatic di- or polyisocyanates as one (first)<br>
component with compounds having hydroxyl groups as the other (second)<br>
component. The concomitant use of polyamines and aminoalcohols as the second<br>
component is also possible to a lesser extent. As those skilled in the art understand, if<br>
amines and/or aminoalcohols are used, the resultant polyurethanes have urea groups.<br>
The number of isocyanate groups in the polyurethane is controlled, in a known<br>
manner, via the ratio of molar amounts of the starting materials.<br>
Ethylenically unsaturated moieties may be introduced subsequently into the<br>
polyurethane containing isocyanate groups in a known manner by the functional interreactions<br>
previously described. It is also possible to use ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compounds with functionalities reactive with isocyanate groups directly as a third<br>
component in preparing the polyurethanes.<br>
Examples of the di- or polyisocyanates are straight-chain or branched alkylene<br>
diisocyanates of 4-12 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic diisocyanates with from 6 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, aromatic diisocyanates with from 8 to 14 carbon atoms,<br>
polyisocyanates having isocyanurate groups, uretdione diisocyanates, polyisocyanates<br>
having biuret groups, polyisocyanates having urethane groups and/or allophanate<br>
groups, polyisocyanates containing oxadiazinetrione groups, uretoneimine-modified<br>
polyisocyanates or mixtures of these.<br>
Examples of diisocyanates are tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate(l,6-diisocyanatohexane), octamethylene diisocyanate, decamethylene<br>
diisocyanate, dodecamethylene diisocyanate, tetradecamethylene diisocyanate,<br>
trimethylhexane diisocyanate and tetramethylhexane diisocyanate, and cycloaliphatic<br>
diisocyanates, such as 1,4-, 1,3- and 1,2-diisocyanatocyclohexane, 4,4'-<br>
di(isocyanatocyclohexyl)-methane, 1 -isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-<br>
(isocyanatomethyl)-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate), and 2,4- and 2,6-<br>
diisocyanato-1-methylcyclohexane, and aromatic diisocyanates, such as 2,4-<br>
diisocyanatotoluene, 2,6-diisocyanatotoluene, tetra-methylxylylene diisocyanate, 1,4-<br>
diisocyanatobenzene, 4,4'- and 2,4-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane, p-xylylene<br>
diisocyanate, and also isopropenyldimethyltolylene diisocyanate.<br>
The polyisocyanates having isocyanurate groups are in particular simple<br>
triisocyanatoisocyanurates, which are cyclic trimers of the diisocyanates, or mixtures<br>
with their higher homologs having more than one isocyanurate ring.<br>
Uretdione diisocyanates are usually cyclic dimerization products of diisocyanates.<br>
The uretdione diisocyanates may, for example, be used as sole component or in a<br>
mixture with other polyisocyanates, in particular the polyisocyanates containing<br>
isocyanurate groups. Suitable polyisocyanates having biuret groups preferably have<br>
an NCO content of from 18 to 22% by weight and an average NCO functionality of<br>
from 3 to 4.5.<br>
Polyisocyanates having urethane and/or allophanate groups may, for example, be<br>
obtained by reacting excess amounts of diisocyanates with simple, polyhydric<br>
alcohols, for example trimethylolpropane, glycerol, 1,2-dihydroxypropane or mixtures<br>
of these. These poiyisocyanates having urethane and/or allophanate groups generally<br>
have an NCO content of from 12 to 20% by weight and an average NCO functionality<br>
of from 2.5 to 3.<br>
Polyisocyanates containing oxadiazinetrione groups can be prepared from<br>
diisocyanate and carbon dioxide.<br>
Suitable compounds having a reactive hydrogen, such as a hydroxyl, are the lowmolecular-<br>
weight diols and polyols mentioned in connection with the preparation of<br>
polyesters, and also the polyesterpolyols, in particular polyesterdiols. Examples of<br>
polyesterpolyols are reaction products from the abovementioned di- or polybasic,<br>
preferably dibasic, carboxylic acids with polyhydric, preferably dihydric and, if<br>
desired, additionally trihydric alcohols. Examples of suitable starting components are<br>
the abovementioned polybasic carboxylic acids and polyhydric alcohols. The<br>
polyesterdiols may also be oligomers of lactones, such as |3-propiolactone, y.-<br>
butyrolactone and e-caprolactone, obtained by oligomerization of the lactones in the<br>
presence of starters based on the abovementioned low-molecular-weight diols. The<br>
abovementioned polyesterdiols or polyols generally have number-average molecular<br>
weights in the range from 500 to 5,000, preferably from 750 to 3,000.<br>
In the broad practice of the invention, the radiation-curable formulation also may<br>
contain small amounts of additional polymer additives that do not cure by radiation,<br>
i.e., polymers with no ethylenically unsaturated, radiation-curable double bonds.<br>
Such polymers usually may be present in an amount of less than 10 wt.% of the<br>
formulation and should preferably have a relatively low glass transition temperature<br>
of below about 50° C., generally below about 40° C. Suitable polymers include those<br>
prepared by free-radical polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
selected from vinylaromatic compounds, vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids<br>
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, Ci -Cio -alkyl acrylates and Ci -Cio -alkyl<br>
methacrylates. Vinylaromatic monomers encompass in particular styrene, <xmethylstyrene></xmethylstyrene>
vinyltoluenes and chlorostyrenes. The vinyl esters encompass in<br>
particular vinyl acetate, such as vinyl propionate. The acrylates and methacrylates<br>
respectively encompass the esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids with methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, nhexanol,<br>
2-ethylhexanol, n-octanol and cyclohexanol. The monomers to be<br>
polymerized also may encompass, as a co-monomer, up to 35% by weight, often only<br>
up to 20% by weight and in many cases only about from 0.1 to 10% by weight of<br>
acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, a-olefins, such as ethylene, propene and isobutene,<br>
dienes, such as butadiene and isoprene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, the amides of these<br>
acids, the N-alkylolamides of these acids, in particular N-methylol(meth) acrylamide,<br>
hydroxyalkyl esters of these acids, in particular 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and<br>
hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, and also ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acids, eg.<br>
vinylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid and acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic<br>
acid. These co-monomers are usually selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, the<br>
amides of these, acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, acrylonitrile and<br>
methacrylonitrile.<br>
The preparation of such polymers is well known and generally takes place by freeradical,<br>
aqueous emulsion polymerization of the abovementioned monomers in the<br>
presence of at least one free-radical polymerization initiator and, if desired, a<br>
surfactant selected from the class consisting of emulsifiers, and/or protective colloids.<br>
In some cases, the physical properties of the radiation curable polymer makes it<br>
inconvenient and sometimes difficult to form a thin, uniform coating of the radiation<br>
curable formulation on the fibrous facing sheet of the gypsum panel. In this case, in<br>
addition to the radiation curable polymer component, the radiation curable<br>
formulation also may include a low-molecular-weight diluent or solvent, which itself<br>
preferably is capable of polymerization by cationic or free-radical pathways. The use<br>
of such an ingredient thus is especially useful in those circumstances where the<br>
viscosity of a particular radiation curable polymer does not readily allow the<br>
formation of a thin, uniform coating on the fibrous facing sheet. These additives are<br>
generally compounds that have at least one ethylenically unsaturated double bond<br>
and/or one epoxy group and have a molecular weight of less than about 800. As<br>
noted, such compounds are generally used to adjust to the desired working<br>
consistency of the radiation-curable formulation. This is particularly important in the<br>
present invention, as the formulation preferably should be essentially free of any nonreactive<br>
(volatile) diluents, such as water and/or inert organic solvents, (i.e., the<br>
formulation preferably contains such components only to such a small extent that it is<br>
not necessary to treat the coating formulation (e.g., by heat drying) to remove them).<br>
Such compounds are therefore also called reactive diluents. The proportion of any<br>
reactive diluents in the radiation curable formulation, based on the total amount of<br>
radiation curable polymer and reactive diluent in the radiation-curable formulation, is<br>
normally in the range from 0 to 60% by weight.<br>
Examples of suitable reactive diluents are vinyl-group-containing monomers, in<br>
particular N-vinyl compounds, such as N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinyl-caprolactam and<br>
N-vinylformamide, also vinyl ethers, such as ethyl vinyl ether, propyl vinyl ether,<br>
isopropyl vinyl ether, butyl vinyl ether, isobutyl vinyl ether, tert-butyl vinyl ether,<br>
amyl vinyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl vinyl ether, dodecyl vinyl ether, octadecyl vinyl ether<br>
and cyclohexyl vinyl ether, ethylene glycol mono- and divinyl ethers, di-, tri- and<br>
tetraethylene glycol mono- and divinyl ethers, polyethyl ene glycol divinyl ether,<br>
ethylene glycol butyl vinyl ether, triethylene glycol methyl vinyl ether, polyethylene<br>
glycol methyl vinyl ether, cyclohexanedimethanol mono- and divinyl ethers,<br>
trimethylolpropane trivinyl ether, aminopropyl vinyl ether, diethylaminoethyl vinyl<br>
ether and polytetrahydrofuran divinyl ether, vinyl esters, such as vinyl acetate,<br>
propionate, stearate and laurate, and vinylaromatics, such as vinyltoluene, styrene , 2-<br>
and 4-butylstyrene and 4-decylstyrene, and also acrylic monomers, eg. phenoxyethyl<br>
acrylate, tert-butylcyclohexyl acrylate and tetrahydrofurfuryl (meth)acrylate.<br>
Compounds containing vinyl groups may also be used directly as cationically<br>
polymerizable reactive diluents. Further suitable compounds are compounds<br>
containing epoxy groups, such as cyclopentene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, epoxidized<br>
polybutadiene, epoxidized soybean oil, 3',4'-epoxycyclohexyl-methyl 3,4-<br>
expoxycyclohexanecarboxylate and glydidyl ethers, eg. butanediol diglycidyl ether,<br>
hexanediol diglycidyl ether, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and pentaerythritol<br>
diglycidyl ether, and the concomitant use of cationically polymerizable monomers<br>
such as unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, dienes, such as butadiene, vinylaromatics,<br>
such as styrene, N-substituted vinylamines, such as vinylcarbazole, and cyclic ethers,<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, also is possible.<br>
The reactive diluents also may include the esters of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids with low-molecular-weight di- or polyhydric alcohols, preferably the<br>
acrylic and methacrylic esters and in particular the acrylic esters, the alcohols<br>
preferably having no further functional groups or, or at most ether groups, besides the<br>
hydroxyl groups.<br>
Examples of such alcohols are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and more highly<br>
condensed representatives of the class, e.g., diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol and tripropylene glycol, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, alkoxylated phenolic compounds, such as ethoxylated and<br>
propoxylated bisphenols, cyclohexanedimethanol, alcohols having three or more<br>
hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane, butanetriol, trimethylolethane,<br>
pentaerythritol, ditrimethylolpropane, dipentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol and the<br>
corresponding alkoxylated, in particular ethoxylated and propoxylated, alcohols.<br>
Well-known reactive diluents include the esterification products of the<br>
abovementioned di- or polyhydric alcohols with acrylic and/or methacrylic acid.<br>
Such compounds are generally termed polyacrylates or polyether acrylates.<br>
Hexanediol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate and trimethylolpropane<br>
triacrylate are particularly suitable.<br>
In one embodiment, such polyacrylates or polyether acrylates can be modified with<br>
primary and/or secondary amines. Suitable amines encompass both primary and<br>
secondary aliphatic amines, such as n-butylamine, n-hexylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine,<br>
dodecylamine, octadecylamine, di-n-butylamine, cycloaliphatic amines, such as<br>
cyclohexylamine, heterocyclic amines, such as piperidine, piperazine, 1-<br>
ethylpiperazine and morpholine, primary amines containing heterocyclic groups, for<br>
example N-(aminoethyl)imidazole, N-(aminoethyl)morpholine,<br>
tetrahydrofurfurylamine and 2-aminoethylthiophene. Other suitable compounds<br>
include alkanolamines, such as ethanolamine, 3-aminopropanol and<br>
monoisopropanolamine, and also alkoxyalkylamines, such as methoxypropylamine<br>
and aminoethoxyethanol. The molar ratio of amine groups to acrylate and/or<br>
methacrylate groups in the amine-modified polyacrylates or polyether acrylates is<br>
normally in the range from 0.01:1 to 0.3:1.<br>
The radiation-curable formulation used according to the present invention, in<br>
principle, encompass any liquid or flowable (e.g. powder) preparation of a radiation<br>
curable polymer. Thus, pulverulent curable formulations also are encompassed, as<br>
known, for example, for powder-coating metallic surfaces. Hot-melt preparations,<br>
though less preferred, are also possible, these becoming flowable only at an elevated<br>
temperature. The radiation-curable formulation also may include the usual<br>
complement of auxiliaries, such as thickeners, flattening agents, flow control agents,<br>
surfactants, defoamers, UV stabilizers, emulsifiers and/or protective colloids and<br>
fillers. Suitable auxiliaries are well known to the person skilled in the art from<br>
coatings technology and in the aggregate are generally included in the formulation<br>
from about 0 to about 15 wt.%. Suitable fillers may include silicates, which are<br>
obtainable by hydrolyzing silicon tetrachloride, siliceous earth, talc, aluminum<br>
silicates, magnesium silicates, calcium carbonates, alumina, inorganic and organic<br>
pigments, etc. Suitable stabilizers encompass typical UV absorbers, such as<br>
oxanilides, triazines, benzotriazoles and benzophenones. These may be used in<br>
combination with usual free-radical scavengers, for example sterically hindered<br>
amines, eg. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-piperidine (HALS<br>
compounds). Stabilizers may optionally be used in amounts of from 0.1 to 5.0% by<br>
weight and preferably from 0.5 to 2.5% by weight, based on the polymerizable<br>
components present in the formulation.<br>
When the formulation is slated to be cured by UV radiation, the formulation also<br>
includes at least one photoinitiator. A distinction needs to be made here between<br>
photoinitiators for free-radical curing mechanisms (polymerization of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated double bonds) and photoinitiators for cationic curing mechanisms<br>
(cationic polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated double bonds or polymerization<br>
of compounds containing epoxy groups). For curing by means of high-energy<br>
electrons (electron-beam curing), the use of photoinitiators may be dispensed with.<br>
Suitable photoinitiators for free-radical photopolymerization, i.e., polymerization of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated double bonds, are benzophenone and benzophenone<br>
derivatives, such as 4-phenyl-benzophenone and 4-chlorobenzophenone, Michler's<br>
ketone, anthrone, acetophenone derivatives, such as 1-benzoylcyclohexan-l-ol, 2-<br>
hydroxy-2,2-dimethylacetophenone and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone,<br>
benzoin and benzoin ethers, such as methyl benzoin ether, ethyl benzoin ether and<br>
butyl benzoin ether, benzil ketals, such as benzil dimethyl ketal, 2-methyl-l-[4-<br>
(methylthio)phenyl]-2-morpholinopropan-l-one, anthraquinone and its derivatives,<br>
such as p-methylanthraquinone and tert-butylanthraquinone, acylphosphine oxides,<br>
such as 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide, ethyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphenylphosphinate<br>
and bisacylphosphine oxides.<br>
Suitable photoinitiators for cationic photopolymerization, i.e,. the polymerization of<br>
vinyl compounds or compounds containing epoxy groups, are aryl diazonium salts,<br>
such as 4-methoxybenzenediazonium hexafluoro-phosphate, benzenediazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate and toluenediazonium tetra-fluoroarsenate, aryliodonium salts, such<br>
as diphenyliodonium hexafluoroarsenate, arylsulfonium salts, such as<br>
triphenylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate, benzene- and toluenesulfonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate and bis[4-diphenylsulfoniophenyl] sulfide<br>
bishexafluorophosphate, disulfones, such as diphenyl disulfone and phenyl-4-tolyl<br>
disulfone, diazodisulfones, imidotriflates, benzoin tosylates, isoquinolinium salts,<br>
such as N-ethoxyisoquinolinium hexafluorophosphate, phenylpyridinium salts, such<br>
as N-ethoxy-4-phenylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate, picolinium salts, such as Nethoxy-<br>
2-picolinium hexafluorophosphate, ferrocenium salts, titanocenes and<br>
titanocenium salts.<br>
These photoinitiators are used, if required, in amounts of from 0.05 to 20% by weight,<br>
more usually from 0.1 to 10% by weight and most often from 1.0 to 5% by weight,<br>
based on the polymerizable components of the radiation curable formulation.<br>
The radiation-curable formulation may also include polymers that have cationically<br>
polymerizable groups, in particular epoxy groups. These include copolymers of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers, the copolymers containing, as comonomers,<br>
ethylenically unsaturated glycidyl ethers and/or glycidyl esters of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids.<br>
They also include the glycidyl ethers of hydroxyl-group-containing polymers, such as<br>
hydroxyl-group-containing polyethers, polyesters, polyurethanes and novolacs. They<br>
include moreover the glycidyl esters of polymers containing carboxylic acid groups.<br>
If it is desired to have a cationically polymerizable component, the radiation curable<br>
formulation may include, instead of or together with the cationically polymerizable<br>
polymer, a low-molecular-weight, cationically polymerizable compound, for example<br>
a di- or polyglycidyl ether of a low-molecular-weight di- or polyol or the di- or<br>
polyester of a low-molecular-weight di- or polycarboxylic acid, for example the<br>
cationically polymerizable reactive diluents specified above.<br>
In the broad practice of the invention, formulation may alternatively include a thermal<br>
initiator, i.e., a compound responsive to heat radiation, in an amount equivalent to<br>
what has been suggested for photointiators.<br>
Most radiation curable formulations suitable for use in accordance with the present<br>
invention will contain a photoinitiator, or thermal initiator in an amount of 1-5% by<br>
weight, an ethylenically unsaturated polymer, such as a urethane, epoxy, polyester or<br>
acrylate, in an amount of 20 to 99% by weight, a multifunctional acrylate in an<br>
amount of 0-60% by weight and other additives in an amount of 5-10% by weight. Of<br>
course, combinations of both photoinitiators and thermal initiators also can be used.<br>
In such a case, for example, the heat generated in a formulation due to the activity of a<br>
photoinitiator can cause activation of the thermal initiator.<br>
According to the invention, the radiation-curable formulation is used to provide a<br>
coating on at least one fibrous facing sheet of a gypsum panel. For this, the radiationcurable<br>
formulation is applied in a known manner, eg. by spraying, trowelling, knife<br>
application, brushing, rolling or pouring onto the fibrous facing sheet of the gypsum<br>
panel. It is also possible that the formulation may be applied to the fibrous facing<br>
sheet of the gypsum panel by a hot-melt process or by a powder-coating process.<br>
The amount of coating applied to the surface of the fibrous mat preferably should be<br>
sufficient to embed the surface of the mat completely in the coating, preferably to the<br>
extent that substantially no fibers protrude through the coating and preferably so that<br>
the coating is impervious to the passage of moisture (in either the liquid or vapor<br>
state). The amount of coating used may be dependent upon the nature of the fibrous<br>
mat. In some case it may be difficult to measure thickness of the coating, such as<br>
where the fibrous mat substrate on which the coating is applied is uneven.<br>
The coating weight is usually in the range from 1 to 50 pounds per 1000 sq. ft. of<br>
gypsum panel, more often in the range from 2 to 25 pounds per 1000 sq. ft. of gypsum<br>
panel, based on the polymerizable components present in the formulation. The<br>
application may take place either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature,<br>
but preferably not at a temperature above 100° C., so as to avoid conditions that could<br>
contribute to undesired calcination of the gypsum core. Although higher or lower<br>
amounts of the radiation curable formulation can be used in any specific case, it is<br>
believed that, for most applications, the amount of powder coating will fall within the<br>
range of about 2 to about 25 Ibs per 1000 sq. ft. of gypsum panel.<br>
In rough terms, the thickness of the coating should be at least about 0.5 mils and is<br>
usually less than about 5 mils, but when the glass mat is relatively thin and the coating<br>
is efficiently dried, a coating as thin as 0.25 mils may suffice. In general, the<br>
thickness of the coating need not exceed about 5 mils and for most applications, a<br>
coating thickness of about 2 mils should usually prove to be sufficient.<br>
Following application of a thin coating of the curable formulation to the fibrous<br>
facing sheet of the gypsum panel, the composition then is cured by passing the coated<br>
gypsum panel under a radiation source, e.g., a UV source, to form the radiation-cured,<br>
e.g., UV-cured polymer coated gypsum panel. The coated gypsum panel made in<br>
accordance with these teachings provides both a liquid and vapor barrier to water.<br>
The coating can be cured by exposure to high-energy radiation, preferably by UV<br>
radiation of wavelength from 250 to 400 nm or by irradiation with high-energy<br>
electrons (electron beams; from 150 to 300 kev). Examples of UV sources include<br>
high-pressure mercury vapor lamps. The radiation dose usually sufficient for<br>
crosslinking is in the range from 80 to 3,000 mJ/cm2.<br>
In another embodiment, especially suitable when the panel is intended to be used as a<br>
tile backer, an aggregate material is included in the radiation curable formulation, or<br>
is applied to the curable formulation that has been coated on a fibrous facing sheet.<br>
The purpose of the added aggregate is to provide the cured coating with sufficient<br>
surface roughness or other surface characteristics to promote or enhance the ability to<br>
adhere tiles or other surface treatments to the radiation cured coating. The nature of<br>
the aggregate can vary widely and this embodiment of the invention is not limited to<br>
any particular type or size of aggregate material. Embraced broadly within the terms<br>
"aggregate" are ceramic microspheres, glass microspheres, calcium carbonate, sand,<br>
aluminum oxide (alumina), crushed stone, glass fibers, gypsum, perlite, and other<br>
inorganic and organic aggregate materials readily recognized by those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
While the aggregate can be added to the curable coating formulation before it is<br>
coated onto the fibrous facing sheet, in the interest of limiting the amount used and<br>
concentrating it where it is most effective, it is preferred to add the aggregate material<br>
onto the curable coating formulation after it has been coated onto the fibrous facing<br>
sheet but before curing the coating. In this way, the aggregate material remains near<br>
the surface of the coating where it is needed to create a surface morphology conducive<br>
to bonding anyone of a number of surface treatments, such as ceramic tiles, to the<br>
gypsum panel. The amount of aggregate added to the coating can vary within wide<br>
limits and it is preferred to use only that amount needed to provide a suitable surface<br>
onto which an adequate bond can be made. For any particular aggregate material, a<br>
suitable level can be arrived at using only routine experimentation. As will be<br>
understood by skilled workers, the amount of aggregate to apply will be a function of<br>
the density of the aggregate used since the objective is to provide a surface coating of<br>
the aggregate on the coating, it not usually being necessary to complete permeate the<br>
depth of the coating with the aggregate. For low density material such as<br>
microspheres, generally, an amount of aggregate of about 1.25 pounds per 1000 sq. ft.<br>
should be suitable. For higher density materials, such as calcium carbonate, an<br>
amount of aggregate of about 15-40 Ibs per 1000 sq. ft. should be suitable, with 20-35<br>
Ibs per 1000 sq. ft. being more preferred.<br>
