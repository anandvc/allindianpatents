				<td>The Present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of psoriasis and other skin disorders comprising cyclopamine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof in combination with a corticosteroid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cellular differentiation plays a critical role In the generation of multiceliular organisms. In human, not only during development but also during the postnatal life, cells In many tissues undergo differentiation to generate new cell types that are required for the proper functioning of organism. Signals for the differentiation of a cell type to another may be derived from the other cellular and non-cellular tissue components In the immediate environment and/or from more distant tissues and organs (e.g. in the form of hormones). Determination of the responses of a cell to the incoming signals Is also complex and depends on the nature of the signal or the set of signals as well as on the more intrinsic features of the cell in question (ag. Its differentiation state and the structure of chromatin). During daily life of a human being numerous cells are lost by various mechanisms (because of acute and chronic Insults and damage and as a result of the programmed cell death for other reasons). These lost cells are in general replaced by the regulated proliferation and differentiation of their precursors, the progenitor and stem cells. Human sidn has relatively greater susceptibility to the environmental insufts (e.g. physical trauma) than many Internal tissues but is well adapted to the circumstances and displays a constant loss and replacement of its uppermost layer. The dead cells that are shed from the uppermost layer of epidermis are normally replaced by the proliferation of basal layer cells of epidermis and by the differentiation of these cells to generate the suprabasal layers. Abnormalities In this differentiation process, because of environmental and/or genetic reasons, result In various diseases whose skin manifestations are in general readily detected. Skin diseases involving the differentiation disorders of nonepidermal skin cells are also varied. Differences in the underlying causes of these diseases result in their different manifestations and clinical presentations but abnormalities of cellular differentiation is a unifying feature of them. Non-limiting examples of the skin diseases known to display abnormalities of cellular differentiation include Ichthyosis vuigaris, lamellar ichtnyosls , palmoplantar keratodermas, pityriasis rubra pilaris , Darier disease and several types of skin tumors. Causes of these skin diseases are in general poorly understood. However complexity of the regulation of cellular differentiation and the presence of multiple regulatory factors means that abnormalities of differentiation may sometimes be secondary to the abnormalities that affect primarily other processes, in the absence of a clear understanding of the causes and mechanisms, available<br>
treatment strategies for these disease are in general poorly effective (Braun-Falco O. et al (2000) Dermatology, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin).<br>
Cyclopamine is a steroidal alkaloid occurring naturally in the Veratrum plants. Teratogenicity of these plants on grazing pregnant animals led to the identification of cyclopamine as an active compound (Keeler R.F. (1969) Phytochemistry 8:223-225). How might have cyclopamine displayed teratogenlcfty was revealed by the finding that it is an inhibitor of the hedgehog/smoothened signal transduction (Incardona J.P. et al. (1998) Development 125:3553-3562; Cooper M.K. et al. (1998) Science 280:1603-1607). The sonic hedgehog protein has been found to induce differentiation of the precursors of ventral cells in the developing central nervous system (Goodrich L.V. et al. (1998) Neuron 21:1243-1257). Thus inhibition of the hedgehog/smoothened signaling pathway by cyclopamine in the developing chicken brain was related to the prevention of the formation of ventral cells and, hence, to holopresencephaly (Incardona J.P. et al. (1998) Development 125:3553-3562; Cooper M.K. et al. (1998) Science 280:1603-1607). Holopresencephaly has been known to be the common malformation in the lambs of the sheep grazing veratrum (Binns W. et al. (1963) Am J. Vet. Res. 24:1164-1175). Cyclopamine has been reported to inhibit cellular differentiation in other systems as well, including the differentiation of bone marrow cells to erythroid cells (Detmer K. et al. (2000) Dev.Biol. 222:242) and the differentiation of the urogenital sinus to prostate (Berman D.M. etal. (2000) J. Urol. 163:204).<br>
Unanticipated from and contrary to the above summarized teaching of the prior art that cyclopamine acts to inhibit cellular differentiation (Incardona J.P. et al.(1998) Development 125:3553-3562; Cooper M.K. et al. (1998) Science 280:1603-1607;Detmer K. et al. (2000) Dev.Biol.222-242; Berman D.M. et al. (2000) J. Urol. 163:204), we found that cyclopamine rather induced differentiation of the basal cell carcinoma cells that were displaying arrest of the cellular differentiation (Tas. S. et al. (2001) PCTYTR01/ 00027, WO 02/078703 ).SImilariy cyclopamine enabled the epidermal cells of psoriatic lesional epidermis to resume normal differentiation (Tas S. et al. (2002) PCT/TR02/00017, WO 02/078704). Again unexpected from the previous reports that cyclopamine had no adverse effect on the viability of transformed cells (Taipaie J. et al. (2000) Nature 406:1005-1009), the cyclopamine-induced differentiation of the basal cell carcinoma cells was accompanied by a massive apoptosis of these cells (Tas. S. et al. (2001) PCT/TR01/ 00027, WO 02/078703).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Cyclopamine is effective in the causations of tumor cell differentiation and apoptosis not only in basal cell carcinomas but also in other skin tumors. Tumors originating from the hair follicle / epidermal cell lineage (e.g. trichoepithelioma) and from melanocytes (e.g. melanocytic nevi) disappeared rapidly upon treatment with cyclopamine. The cyclopamine-induced clearance of psoriatic lesions from the skin of patients with psoriasis is also associated with the causation of cellular differention in lesional epidermis. We disclose that effectiveness of cyclopamine in the treatment of psoriasis is enhanced significantly further by the use of therapeutic compositions comprising of cyclopamine and a cortlcosteroid and/or by the pre-treatment of lesions with a corticosteroid.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
We disclose that cyclopamine is effective in inducing differentiation of several cell types and that this Induction of differentiation can be obtained with sufficient selectivity In vivo (without undue adverse effects) under the conditions we disclose, so that good therapeutic effectiveness can be attained on a number of diseases having the unifying feature of being associated with the inhibition of cellular differentiation. In tumors (both malignant and benign tumors) induction of the differentiation of tumor cells by cyclopamine is disclosed to be associated commonly with the apoptosis (programmed death) of tumor cells, adding thereby to the anti-tumoral therapeutic effectiveness of cyclopamine. The unprecedented therapeutic effectiveness of cyclopamine in psoriasis (disclosed earlier in PCT/TR02/ 00017, WO 027 078704) is increased even further by the use of therapeutic compositions comprising of cyclopamine and a corticosteroid in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
Cyclopamine can be dissolved in ethanol or another suitable solvent and can be mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier depending on the desired mode of application. For topical applications, cyclopamine can be dissolved in ethanol or another suitable solvent and can be mixed with a suitable base cream, ointment or gel. Cyclopamine can also be entrapped in hydrogels or in other pharmaceutical forms enabling controlled release and it can be adsorbed onto dermal patches. The effects shown here in figures Fig.lAto Fig.11 and Fig.2A to Fig.2D, and Fig.3A to Fig.3F have been obtained by cream preparations obtained by mixing a solution of cyclopamine in ethanol with a base cream so as to get the indicated final concentrations of cyclopamine. The base cream used is made predominantly of heavy paraffin oil (10% w/w),<br>
vaseline (10% w/w), stearyl alcohol (8% w/w), polyoxylsteareth-40 (3% w/w) and water (68% w/w) but another suitably formulated base cream is also possible. Similarities of the lipid versus water solubility characteristics and molecular structures of the cyclopamine and corticosteroids (both being steroidal molecules) facilitate their mixing in the same pharmaceutical carrier. Optimal concentrations of cyclopamine and a corticosteroid in a pharmaceutical form as well as the optimal dosing and application schedules can obviously be affected by such factors as the particular pharmaceutical form, particular corticosteroid and the localization and characteristics of the lesions to be treated; however these can be determined by following well known published methods of optimization. The corticosteroid used in obtaining the effects shown in figures Fig. 1C and Fig. 1D was clobetasol 17-propionate in a final concentration of ~0.55mM in base cream (concentration of cyclopamine in the same cream was ~9mM). The corticosteroid used for the pre-treatment of the lesion shown in Fig. 1E was clobetasol 17-propionate in a final concentration of ~1.1mM in base cream. Similar corticosteroid actions are obtained by substituting the clobetasol 17- propionate in this cream with -50 mM hydrocortisone. Other corticosteroid molecules well known in the art are contemplated to be also suitable and capable of replacing the above-mentioned corticosteroid molecules at suitable concentrations (the suitable concentration ranges for a given corticosteroid are also known in the art).<br>
Fig.lA shows a psoriatic plaque on the antecubital region of a 29 years old man prior to treatment. Approximately 20 u.1 of the cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine in the base cream described above) was applied onto this lesion every fourth hour for 24 hours. Treatment was then discontinued and the lesion was followed-up. The lesion showed decrease of erythema on the eighth hour of treatment and then continued regression also during the non-treated follow-up to reach to the state shown in Fig.16 on day three and became undetectable on day four.<br>
Fig. 1C shows another psoriatic plaque located on the deltoid region skin of the same patient prior to treatment. Approximately 20 |il of a cream preparation containing ~9 mM cyclopamine and -0.55 mM clobetasol 17 propionate (in base cream) was applied onto this lesion every fourth hour. This lesion also displayed decrease of erythema on the eighth hour and became undetectable on day three (Fig.1 D shows its appearance on the 68th hour). In the same patient other psoriatic lesions that were covered with a cream preparation containing ~1.1 mM clobetasol 17-propionate (but no cyclopamine) on every fourth or eight hour showed no detectable change during the same period (i.e. the lesions were persisting on day three). The enhanced therapeutic response to cyclopamine, even at half of the concentration we were using on other lesions of the same patient, prompted further evaluation of the therapeutic compositions comprising of cyclopamine and a corticosteroid. We evaluated in addition pre-<br><br>
treatment of the psoriatic lesions with a topical corticosteroid followed by treatment with the cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine in base cream). Fig.lE shows a psoriatic plaque on the hypochondria! region of the same patient prior to the applications of cyclopamine. This lesion was treated with the corticosteroid cream alone for 48 hours, corticosteroid was then discontinued and the treatment was switched to the applications of -20 µl cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine in base cream) every fourth hour. Fig.lF shows the lesion on the 24th hour of the cyclopamine cream applications and shows near complete disappearance of the lesion by this time.<br>
Severity of psoriatic lesions can be assessed on a semi-quantitative scale by giving separate scores for the erythema, elevation and scaling of a lesion and then by summing up the scores to obtain a score called the EES score of that lesion (Bowman P.H. et al. (2002) J. Am. Acad.Dermatol. 46:907-913). Table I shows comparisons of the therapeutic responses to various forms of treatment, evaluated by the EES scoring. It is seen that use of a therapeutic composition comprising of cyclopamine and a corticosteroid in the treatment of psoriatic lesions enhanced therapeutic effectiveness significantly in comparison to the use of a composition containing only cyclopamine as the active ingredient. Pre-treatment of lesions with corticosteroid for a day, followed by treatment with the cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine In base cream), enhanced the therapeutic effectiveness similarly. Table I shows that psoriatic lesions treated for a day with a composition containing cyclopamine and then followed up without any treatment also regressed but in general at a relatively slower pace. While this latter property may be of some use in clinical practice, most patients may be expected to prefer the faster clearance of their lesions.<br>
Cyclopamine cream alone caused regression and clearance of psoriatic lesions at paces much faster than those obtained by conventional treatments as described earlier (PCT7TR 02/00017, WO 02/078704) and in here. However further enhancement of the therapeutic response was possible when cyclopamine was used together with, or after a brief pre-treatment with, corticosteroids. This property increases the clinical utility of cyclopamine treatment and may in part be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. Contributions of the inflammatory cells and cytokines to the development of psoriatic lesions have been well-recognized (Krueger J.G. etai. (1990) J. Invest. Dermatol. 94:1355-1405). Expressions of both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of one or more of its ligands (e.g. the transforming growth factor alpha) are known to be markedly increased in psoriatic lesional epidermis. These may set up an autocrine stimulation loop contributed further by the causation of increase of epidermal EGFR by inflammation (Krueger J.G. et al. (1990) J. Invest. Dermatol. 94:1358-1405). However, unusually rapid therapeutic response to the<br>
cyclopamine cream alone (but not to the corticosteroid alone) and, indeed, continued regression of the psoriatic lesions after discontinuation of cyclopamine applications are consistent with the effective intervention by cyclopamine (but not by corticosteroids) with a key/proximal pathogenic events. Because EGFR over expression in the suprabasal layers of psoriatic lesional epidermis may set up an autocrine stimulation loop and since return of EGFR expression to the basal layer of epidermis is regarded to be one of the first signs of effective treatment of psoriasis by various modalities (King L.E.Jr et al. (1990) J. Invest.Dermatol. 95:10S-12S), response of the EGFR expression pattern to cyclopamine treatment was evaluated. For this purpose mouse monoclonal antibody EGFR.113 (Novocastra Labs. Ltd., U.K.) against the human EGFR was used as primary antibody and the immunohistochemical assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Fig.1l shows that application of the cyclopamine cream onto psoriatic lesions caused rapid normalization of the EGFR expression pattern and that the immunohistochemically detected EGFR became again restricted mostly to the basal layer of epidermis by the 24th hour of treatment (Fig.1l). The EGFR expression pattern following the cyclopamine treatment of lesion (Fig.11) was indistinguishable from that seen in non-lesional skin (Fig.1G). Psoriatic lesional skin treated with the placebo cream (i.e. the base cream lacking cyclopamine), on the other hand, continued to display the markedly contrasting pathological pattern and overexpression of EGFR in the suprabasal layers of epidermis (Fig.lH). Thus cyclopamine treatment had rapid therapeutic effect on the psoriatic lesions also by the criterion of EGFR expression (King L.E.Jr et a!.(1990) J.lnvestDermatol. 95:10S-12S).<br>
Causation of the differentiation of the basal cell carcinoma cells by cyclopamine has been found associated with their apoptosis (programmed death) (PCT/TR 01/00027, WO 02/078703). Figures Fig. 2A to Fig. 2D show that such effects of cyclopamine are not restricted to the basal cell carcinomas. Trichoepithelioma is a tumor associated with genetic changes that cause increased hedgehog-smoothened signaling (Vorechovsky I et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4677-4681; Nilsson M. et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:3438-3443). Fig 2A shows a trichoepithelioma on the cheek of 82 years old man prior to treatment and Fig 2B shows the same skin area after only 24 hours of exposure to the cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine in the base cream; ~25 µlcream was applied every third hour directly onto the tumor). Because of the rapid regression, treatment was discontinued on the 24th hour and the entire skin area corresponding to the original tumor was excised for Investigation. Fig 2C and Fig 2D show the tissue region that contained residual tumor ceils on the 24th hour and reveal marked apoptotic activity among these residual tumor cells. Cystic space resulting from the apoptotic removal of tumor cells (Fig 2C, Fig 2D) as well as the mononuclear cellular infiltration of tumor (Fig 2D) are seen. Another noteworthy finding in this patient was the decreased size<br>
and pigmentation of a mole located nearby the treated tumor on the 24th hour of treatment (Fig 2B versus Fig 2A). As cyclopamine could have diffused from the adjacent area of application, the mole (a benign melanocytic tumor) appears to be sensitive to relatively low concentrations of cyclopamine. Indeed treatment of melanocytic nevi with the cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine in base cream) in another volunteer also caused similarly rapid depigmentation and disappearance of the nevi (data not shown).<br>
Fig 3A shows a pigmented basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the lower eyelid of a 59 years old man prior to treatment. Cyclopamine cream (18 mM cyclopamine In base cream) was applied in this patient onto all of the nodules except for the one marked by the arrow. This nodule, which could have received cyclopamine only by diffusion from the adjacent treated region, would be exposed to a relatively lower concentration of cyclopamine. As the pigmented nature of this tumor facilitated clinical follow-up, treatment (application of ~20 |J cyclopamine cream on every fourth hour) was discontinued on the third day when the tumor in the treated region had largely regressed but still contained visible parts (Fig. 3B). The tumor was then followed up without treatment for a study of the possible late effects. A clear further clinical regression was not observed in the absence of treatment and the skin area corresponding to the original tumor was excised on the sixth day of follow up (ninth day from the start of treatment). Hematoxylene-eosine stained sections from the treated region of tumor revealed many cystic spaces that lacked tumor cells (Fig.3C).The absence of an epithelium lining these cysts (Fig.3C) Is consistent with the representation by these cysts of the tissue areas that were formerly occupied by the tumor cells. At this time point (the sixth day of non-treated follow up), tissue sections displayed a relative paucity of the apoptotic cells (Fig .3C) consistent with the known rapidity of the clearance of apoptotic cells from live tissues. On the other hand the residual tumor cells, particularly near the edges of cysts, showed unusually high frequencies of cells displaying features of spinous differentiation (e.g. the area towards the lower left of Fig.3C; seen more clearly on higher magnification as exemplified from another area in Fig.SD). Similar areas of differentiation or cysts were absent in the punch biopsy material obtained from the same tumor prior to the initiation of treatment (Fig.3E). The tumor nodule that received relatively lower concentration of cyclopamine (marked by arrow in Fig.3A) had a large cystic center on the sixth day of follow up (Fig.3F). The residual periphery of the nodule, however, continued to have cells with typical BCC morphology although frequency of the cells with features of differentiation (e.g. with enlarged and more eosinophilic cytoplasm) was again increased and smaller cysts existed within this periphery (Fig.3F). Thus, while the tumor response to optimal concentrations of cyclopamine was relatively rapid, exposure to suboptimal concentrations left behind tumor cells that persisted during the period of follow up.<br>
These examples further illustrate effectiveness of the described treatment in causations of tumor cell differentiation and apoptosis and in obtaining rapid clinical regression of the tumors that display increased hedgehog-smoothened signaling. Effectiveness on several independent tumors in unrelated patients with differing genotypes is consistent with the general utility of the described treatment. Treatment with cyclopamine under the described conditions has not revealed undue adverse effects on normal tissue components (including the putative stem cells) by histological /immunohistochemical criteria as we have disclosed also earlier (PCT/TR01/00027, WO 02/078704 ). Furthermore former skin sites of cyclopamine application that have been followed up to more than 2 years at the time of this writing continue to display healthy-looking normal skin and hair suggesting functional preservation of the stem cells and long-term safety.<br>
Most of the biological and therapeutic effects of cyclopamine disclosed here and earlier (WO 02/078703, WO 02/078704) have a unifying feature in that they are related to the causation of cellular differentiation. It is therefore specifically contemplated that other molecules can be derived from cyclopamine or synthesized in such a way that they exert similar receptor-binding properties and biological and therapeutic effects as cyclopamine. Such molecules are called here as "derivatives of cyclopamine". The term " derivatives of cyclopamine", as used here, is defined as follows:<br>
A molecule that contains the region of the cyclopamine molecule involved in the binding of cyclopamine to its biological target but contains in addition modifications of the parent cyclopamine molecule In such ways that the newly derived molecule continues to be able to bind specifically to the same biological target (i.e. the smoothened protein ) to exert the biological effects of cyclopamine/disclosed in this invention and in WO 02/078703 and WO 02/078704. Such modifications of cyclopamine may include one or more permissible replacement of or deletion of a molecular group in the cyclopamine molecule or in addition of a molecular group (particularly a small molecular group such as the methyl group) to the cyclopamine molecule provided that the resultant molecule is stable and possesses the capability of specific binding to the same biological target as cyclopamine to exert the biological effects of cyclopamine disclosed in this invention and in WO 02/078703 and WO 02/078704. Derivation of such new molecules from cyclopamine can be readily achieved  by those skilled in the art and the continuance or abolishment of the possession of the biological effects of cyclopamine in the newly derived molecule can also be readily determined by those skilled in the art, for example by testing for the biological effects disclosed In this application and in WO 02/078703 and WO 02/078704.<br>
Table 1. Semi-quantitative Evaluation Of The Responses Of Psoriatic Lesions To Different<br>
Types Of Treatment<br>
ESS score* of the psoriatic lesions before and on day 4 of treatment (mean ± S.D.)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Sum of the erythema, elevation and scaling scores (each on a 0 to 4 scale with 0.5 increments as described by Bowman P.M. et al (2002) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 46:907-913). In the "1 day only" treatments, treatment with Cyclopamine was continued for 1 day only. The lesions were then followed up without treatment and the EES scores were determined. Numbers of lesions scored in each treatment category are shown. Scores of the lesions that were excised before day 4 for hlstopathological /immunohistochemical analyses are not Included in this evaluation and calculations. (Cyclopamine+CS) cream refers to treatment with a cream preparation containing ~ 9 mM cyclopamine and - 0.55 mM clobetasol 17-propionate or to treatment with a cream preparation containing ~ 18 mM cyclopamine after a day of pre-treatment with a cream preparation containing ~ 1.1 mM clobetasol 17-propionate. Results of these two types of treatment were similar and were therefore calculated as a single group.<br><br><br>
 Claim;-<br>
1.	A pharmaceutical composition for treatment of psoriasis and other skin disorders by causing<br>
regression or clearance of skin lesions showing inhibition of differentiation of epidermal cells<br>
comprising cyclopamine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof in combination<br>
with a corticosteroid in effective amounts such as herein described.<br>
2.	A pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the corticosteroid is clobetasol<br>
17-propionate or hydrocortisone.<br>
3.	A pharmaceutical composition, substantially as hereinbefore described in reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
