CATALYST SUPPORT<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst support, such as<br>
may be used, for example, for the steam reforming of<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
So that as high a conversion rate as possible and as<br>
high an output as possible are obtained during<br>
heterogeneously catalysed reactions in the gas phase,<br>
as large a contact surface as possible should be<br>
provided between the gas phase and the catalyst<br>
surface, so that an intensive exchange between the<br>
catalyst and the gaseous reaction components becomes<br>
possible. Thus, for heterogeneously catalysed<br>
reactions, reactors have been developed in which the<br>
catalyst is provided as a loose heap of small catalyst<br>
bodies. The heap must in this case be designed in such<br>
a way that, on the one hand, a large surface is<br>
provided as a contact surface between a solid catalyst<br>
and gaseous reactants, but, on the other hand, the<br>
pressure drop across the reactor also does not become<br>
too great. Otherwise, the gas throughput through the<br>
reactor drops or a high compression of the reaction gas<br>
is required. The catalyst introduced into the reactor<br>
is to be in as high a fraction as possible for the<br>
catalysed reaction. The heap of catalyst should<br>
therefore not have too high a density, since,<br>
otherwise, the catalyst fraction which is arranged in<br>
further-inward portions of the catalyst body and is<br>
therefore not available for a catalysis of the reaction<br>
rises too sharply. The catalyst body should therefore<br>
have as high a ratio as possible of the surface of the<br>
catalyst body to its weight.  Finally,  the catalyst<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
bodies must have sufficiently high mechanical<br>
stability, so that they do not disintegrate under<br>
mechanical load and collapse into a finely particulate<br>
powder or granulate which blocks the flow paths within<br>
the catalyst packing and leads to an increase in the<br>
pressure drop. Finally, the catalyst bodies must also<br>
be shaped such that, when introduced into the reactor,<br>
they form the desired heap, that is to say the catalyst<br>
bodies should not, for example, be tilted on edge, so<br>
as not to form within the reactor any larger cavities<br>
which are not filled with catalyst.<br>
In addition to simple spheres or granulates, therefore,<br>
a whole series of catalyst bodies have been developed,<br>
which provide a uniform heap and as large a surface as<br>
possible. Although there is already a high diversity of<br>
forms for catalyst bodies, there is still always room<br>
for further developments.<br>
Reactors filled with catalysts or catalyst bodies are<br>
usually operated continuously for a lengthy period of<br>
time of several months to several years, so that slight<br>
increases in value in output during the production of<br>
the desired compounds already have major economic<br>
effects on the viability of the plant.<br>
Likewise, an albeit slight increase in the stability of<br>
the catalyst moulded bodies usually means a significant<br>
economic benefit, since the operating time of the plant<br>
can be prolonged and few interruptions in the<br>
production process for renewing the catalyst packing<br>
are required.<br>
DE 39 35 073 describes a method for the catalytic<br>
dehydration of hydrocarbons, in particular of aromatic<br>
alkyls, at increased temperature in the presence of<br>
steam and metal-oxide catalyst moulded bodies. The<br>
moulded bodies have a gearwheel-like configuration with<br><br>
— 3 —<br>
at least three teeth, the following dimension ratios<br>
applying:<br>
(a)	the ratio tip diameter (d2)  : root diameter<br>
(d1) is about 1.2 to 2.5 : 1;<br>
(b)	the ratio space width at the tooth root (b1):<br>
tooth width (b2) at the tooth crown is 0.1 to<br>
0.9 : 1;<br>
(c)	the space width at the tooth root (b1) is at<br>
least 0.1 mm.<br>
DE 39 34 032 Al describes a heat-transmission or<br>
filling-body element, with a core region which extends<br>
in the longitudinal direction and on which are arranged<br>
projections running in the longitudinal direction and<br>
having a T-shaped cross section.<br>
DE 31 41 942 Al describes catalyst moulded bodies with<br>
an essentially cylindrical configuration, having a<br>
plurality of longitudinal depressions which extend<br>
radially inwards from the cylinder circumference and<br>
delimit elevations which lie between them and the<br>
maximum width of which is greater than that of the<br>
depressions.<br>
DE 31 18 835 Al describes a catalyst structure for the<br>
partial oxidation of n-butane for the production of<br>
maleic acid anhydride. The catalysts are in the form of<br>
a tablet, in the centre of which a hole or a cavity is<br>
arranged.<br>
DE 29 14 079 describes heaped exchange bodies with<br>
reactive material, which are suitable, in particular,<br>
for the enrichment of trace substances from large water<br>
masses. The heaped bodies have a mechanically stable<br>
outer contour and a liquid-accessible reactive surface<br>
protected from mechanical attack by adjacent bodies.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
DE 27 19 543 A describes ceramic bodies for receiving a<br>
catalyst, in particular for the forming of<br>
hydrocarbons. The ceramic body is in the form of a<br>
tube, in the inner cavity of which are arranged webs<br>
running radially outwards from the longitudinal axis.<br>
DE 24 25 058 describes filling bodies consisting of<br>
ceramic material which are in the form of tubular<br>
segments. The tubular segments have a plurality of<br>
longitudinal ducts running parallel to one another. In<br>
this case, a plurality of longitudinal ducts may be<br>
arranged around a central longitudinal duct.<br>
The object on which the invention is based was,<br>
therefore, to provide a catalyst body which makes it<br>
possible to produce as homogeneous a catalyst heap as<br>
possible, while as large a surface of the catalyst body<br>
as possible is to be provided.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a catalyst body<br>
having the features of Patent Claim 1. Advantageous<br>
developments are the subject-matter of the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
According to the invention, a cylindrical catalyst body<br>
is provided, which on its circumferential surface has<br>
grooves running parallel to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the catalyst body and webs running between the grooves.<br>
The catalyst body is characterized in that the grooves<br>
and the webs running between the grooves are in their<br>
cross section in the form of a segment of a circle.<br>
The grooves and webs provided on the circumferential<br>
surface of the catalyst body enlarge the surface of the<br>
catalyst body, so that, with the quantity of active<br>
mass being the same, a larger contact surface between<br>
the catalyst and the gaseous reaction partners is also<br>
provided, as compared with a straightforward<br>
cylindrical  shape.  As a  result,  with the  catalyst<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
quantity being constant, a higher throughput of the<br>
reaction partners through the reactor can be brought<br>
about, and, as a result, also an increase in the output<br>
per unit time. The grooves are in their cross section<br>
in  the  form of  a  segment  of  a  circle.  What  is<br>
considered in this context to be a cross section is a<br>
section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
catalyst body. Owing to the arcuate configuration of<br>
the grooves, stress notches are avoided, which may lead<br>
to a fracture of the catalyst body. Webs, the cross<br>
section of which is in the form of a segment of a<br>
circle, run between the grooves. Owing to the arcuate<br>
configuration of the cross section of the web surface,<br>
edges are avoided, which, for example, may break when<br>
the catalyst bodies are being introduced into the<br>
reactor.  In  the  catalyst  body  according  to  the<br>
invention,  the selected radius of the segment of a<br>
circle of the webs is different from the radius of the<br>
segment of a circle of the grooves. The catalyst bodies<br>
therefore cannot come together in such a way that a web<br>
of one catalyst body comes to bear in the groove of<br>
another catalyst body, in which case the corresponding<br>
surfaces of web and groove bear one against the other<br>
in a planar manner and cause a  reduction in the<br>
available catalyst surface. If the radius of the cross<br>
section of the webs is smaller than the radius of the<br>
grooves, the webs may admittedly come to bear in the<br>
grooves, but the surfaces of groove and web do not lie,<br>
planar, one on the other. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
the radius of the segment of a circle of the webs is<br>
larger than the radius of the segment of a circle of<br>
the grooves. Thus, the webs cannot penetrate into the<br>
grooves and come to bear there. The selected radius of<br>
the segments of a circle of the grooves is preferably<br>
between 1 and 5 mm, in particular preferably between 2<br>
and 3 mm. The radius of the segments of a circle of the<br>
webs is preferably between 2 and 5 mm, in particular<br>
preferably between 3 and 4 mm.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Preferably, the catalyst body has a central duct which<br>
extends along the longitudinal axis of the catalyst<br>
body. Thus, the surface of the catalyst body can be<br>
further enlarged and the density or weight of the<br>
catalyst body further lowered, without any appreciable<br>
loss of stability of the catalyst body having to be<br>
accepted.<br>
The central duct preferably has a circular cross<br>
section.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the catalyst body<br>
has secondary ducts which run parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis, but eccentrically with respect to<br>
this. By means of the secondary ducts, a further<br>
enlargement of the surface of the catalyst body is<br>
achieved, and the quantity of active material required<br>
for producing the catalyst body is further reduced.<br>
The secondary ducts preferably have a circular cross<br>
section.<br>
The selected number of secondary ducts is preferably<br>
greater than 7, in particular preferably greater than<br>
8, and is particularly preferably equal to 9. The<br>
selected number of secondary ducts is preferably as<br>
high as possible, so that the surface of the catalyst<br>
body can be configured as large as possible and in<br>
order to keep as low as possible the pressure drop<br>
caused by the catalyst body. On the other hand, a<br>
compromise must be found in terms of the stability of<br>
the catalyst body. The webs between the secondary ducts<br>
or between the central duct and the secondary ducts<br>
must still be sufficiently wide to ensure that the load<br>
caused by the heap on the individual catalyst support<br>
can still be absorbed.<br>
The longitudinal axes of the secondary ducts are<br>
preferably arranged  on  a  circle  or  a  surface  of<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
cylinder, the centre point or axis of which is formed<br>
by the longitudinal axis of the catalyst body. The<br>
catalyst support thereby acquires an essentially<br>
rotationally symmetrical configuration, with the result<br>
that a higher degree of freedom in the arrangement of<br>
the catalyst body in the packing of the reactor is<br>
achieved, that is to say the homogeneity of the packing<br>
of the catalyst body is increased, thereby achieving a<br>
uniform gas flow through the reactor packing. The<br>
diameter of the circle on which the centre points or<br>
longitudinal axes of the secondary ducts are arranged<br>
is preferably between 10 and 20 mm, preferably between<br>
12 and 16 mm.<br>
The centre point of the segment of a circle of the webs<br>
is preferably arranged on the longitudinal axis of the<br>
corresponding secondary duct. As a result, the web,<br>
which delimits the secondary ducts relative to the<br>
outside of the catalyst body, acquires a uniform<br>
thickness, and the forces acting on the outside of the<br>
catalyst body can be introduced, due to the arcuate<br>
shape of the web, into the catalyst body, with the<br>
result that the stability of the latter is increased.<br>
The arcuate shape of the web can be seen in a view of<br>
the end face of the catalyst body.<br>
The secondary ducts arranged in the catalyst body<br>
preferably have a smaller diameter than the central<br>
duct. The selected diameter of the central duct may be<br>
relatively large, in order thereby to enlarge the<br>
surface of the catalyst body and to reduce the pressure<br>
drop caused by the individual catalyst body. The<br>
diameter of the central duct is in this case selected<br>
such that the webs arranged between the central duct<br>
and secondary ducts have a sufficient thickness to<br>
ensure the required stability of the catalyst body.<br>
The selected diameter of the central duct is preferably<br>
between  4  and 8 mm.  The  selected diameter of the<br><br>
secondary ducts is preferably between 1.5 and 3 mm. The<br>
selected thickness of the webs, which delimit the<br>
secondary ducts relative to the outside of the catalyst<br>
body or are arranged between the secondary ducts or<br>
between the secondary ducts and the central duct, is<br>
preferably greater than 1 mm, preferably greater than<br>
1.5 mm, and particularly preferably between 1.6 and<br>
4 mm.<br>
In order to achieve as uniform a heaping of the<br>
catalyst bodies as possible in the reactor, the<br>
catalyst body according to the invention is preferably<br>
configured such that its extent in the direction of the<br>
longitudinal axis corresponds approximately to the<br>
diameter of the catalyst body perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal axis. Preferably, the selected ratio of<br>
the diameter of the catalyst body to its longitudinal<br>
extent is between 0.9 and 1.5. The selected diameter of<br>
the catalyst body is preferably between 15 mm and<br>
30 mm, preferably between 18 and 25 mm, and is<br>
particularly preferably about 21 mm. The extent of the<br>
catalyst body in the direction of the longitudinal axis<br>
is preferably between 15 mm and 30 mm, preferably<br>
between 18 mm and 25 mm, and is particularly preferably<br>
about 16 mm.<br>
In order to achieve as long a useful life as possible<br>
for the heaping of the catalyst bodies, the catalyst<br>
bodies must have sufficiently high strength. This may<br>
be achieved, on the one hand, by the geometric<br>
construction of the catalyst body and, on the other<br>
hand, by the strength of the material from which the<br>
catalyst body is produced. Preferably, the catalyst<br>
body has a lateral pressure resistance of more then<br>
700 N. The lateral pressure resistance can be measured<br>
by determining the force which is at least required in<br>
order to bring about a bursting of the catalyst body<br>
when the latter is tension-mounted between two planar<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
jaws, the planar surfaces of the jaws being arranged<br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the catalyst body.<br>
The catalyst body is particularly suitable for use in<br>
the steam reforming of hydrocarbons. In a version as a<br>
catalyst for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, the<br>
catalyst body is preferably constructed essentially<br>
from, in each case calculated as a metal oxide:<br>
-	NiO	10 - 20% by weight<br>
-	CaO	10 - 20% by weight<br>
-	A12O3	up to 100% by weight.<br>
The catalyst body may contain slight guantities of<br>
impurities. The fraction of Na and of SiO2 in the<br>
catalyst body is preferably less than 0.05% by weight.<br>
The catalyst body according to the invention can be<br>
produced by means of conventional methods, for example<br>
by extrusion. The constituents of the catalyst body are<br>
in this case ground into a fine powder which preferably<br>
has an average grain size D50 of 5 to 300 urn, if<br>
appropriate mixed with a lubricant, such as graphite or<br>
a long-chain fatty acid, and then, if appropriate after<br>
being mixed with water, converted into the desired<br>
form.<br>
A further subject of the invention is the use of the<br>
above-described catalyst body for the steam reforming<br>
of hydrocarbons.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail further<br>
below, with reference to an accompanying figure in<br>
which:<br>
Fig.l   shows a cross section through an embodiment of<br>
the catalyst body according to the invention.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section through the catalyst body<br>
1 according to the invention perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal axis 2 of the catalyst body 1 or to the<br>
end  face  of  the  catalyst  body  according  to  the<br>
invention. The outer circumferential surface 3 of the<br>
catalyst body 1 is composed of a sequence of grooves 4<br>
and webs 5. The grooves 4 and webs 5 form in each case<br>
segments of a circle in a view of the cross section,<br>
the selected radius 6 of the segments of a circle of<br>
the grooves 4 being smaller than the radius 7 of the<br>
segments of a circle of the webs 5. In the case of<br>
catalyst  bodies  arranged  next  to  one  another,<br>
therefore, the webs 5 of the one catalyst body 1 cannot<br>
bear in a planar manner against the surface of the<br>
grooves  4  of  the  other  catalyst  body.  Along  the<br>
longitudinal axis 2 of the catalyst body 1 runs a<br>
central duct 8. Nine secondary ducts 10 are arranged at<br>
regular  intervals  around the  central  duct  8  on  a<br>
circle 9, the centre point of which coincides with the<br>
longitudinal axis 2 of the catalyst body 1, and run<br>
parallel to the central duct 8. The diameter 11 of the<br>
secondary ducts 10 is smaller than the diameter 12 of<br>
the central duct 8. The longitudinal axis 13 of the<br>
secondary ducts 10 in this case coincides with the<br>
longitudinal axis or the centre point of the segments<br>
of  a circle  of the assigned webs  5,  so that  the<br>
secondary ducts are delimited relative to the outside<br>
of the catalyst body 1 by an arcuate web 14 which has<br>
an essentially constant thickness. The thickness of the<br>
webs 15 arranged between two secondary ducts 10 in this<br>
case corresponds approximately to the thickness of the<br>
arcuate webs 14. In the embodiment shown, the selected<br>
thickness of the webs 16 which are arranged between the<br>
central duct 8 and secondary ducts 10 is greater than<br>
the thickness of the webs 15 which are arranged between<br>
two secondary ducts 10. The diameter 17 of the catalyst<br>
body 1 corresponds approximately to the longitudinal<br>
extent of the catalyst body in the direction of the<br>
longitudinal axis 2.<br><br>
