The present invention relates to a method and a systsm fcr r.anaging audio-visual contents' for the distribution thsrsof   in the on-demand mode.<br>
The	invention        relates        particularly,	but        non<br>
exclusively, to a method and a system lor managing television contents being available on external data necwcrks and to be distributed in the on-demand mode to a plurality of final users which subscribed to the sar-v-ice and the following description is given with reference to this field of application for convenience of  illustration only.<br>
Backc'ground Art<br>
As it is well known, the increasing diffusion of digital networks, both terrestrial and satellite and wireless, which can be used for the physical transmission of audio-visual contents, now allows a change of the traditional television equipment toward the so-called on-demand mode for the final residential users.<br>
In particular, differently from a common television set wherein Che audio-visual content transmission, oiace a channel chosen, occurs according to the TV programs imposed by the TV broadcaster, the transmission of audio-visual content according to the on-demand mode must allow a particular audio-visual content to be available, whether it is an entertainment program, a news cr other program, only on explicit demand of the user  and only when  this  request   is  inade.<br><br>
It    should   be	nctad   that    the   delivery   c£   audio-visual<br>
concsr.rs      en	digital      networks      requires      however     a<br>
considerable	transmission     capacity     of     the     networks<br>
themselves.<br>
This is one of the main reasons, besides the not-wide spread diffusion of these networks on the national terri-cries, Uniting at present the market of the on-den:anc   transmission  of   audio-visual   contencs.<br>
On the ether har.d, this transmission mode is considered unanimously the key instrument: just for a real diffusion of the broadband networks. In face, if the on-demand transmission service is net available, telephone companies, which possess the presen:: networks and which are the only responsible for the diffusion thereof, are considerably restrained in the development of the widespread distribution of the connections to digit-al net-works, which have been up to now little attractive from the commercial and the final residential  users  point  of view.<br>
Without a real extension of broadband connections, the con^ianies involved in offering on-demand video services are at present strictly linked, to telephone companies and they did not invest considerably in research and development to be able to offer sophisticated products to the wider market, the so-called consumer market, addressing mainly to specific markets and to the business  market.<br>
The products which are presently available on the market suitable for offering on-demand audio-visual contents require however a broadband connection and they are strictly dependent on the quality and transmission canacity  of   the  connection being available<br><br>
tcgetiiar with the device offered for receiving and viewing audio-visual contents.<br>
In particular, these products are all based on a centralized processing model, All the audio-visual concents are therefore resident on cne or mere central servers connected to the digital networks and, upon each peripheral user demand, chey start the delivery in real rirne of the audio-visual content.<br>
The highest number of users simultaneously accive in viewing broadband audio-visual contents is therefore limited by the maximura capacity of each server multiplied by the number of servers being conneciied.<br>
At present, the most important telephone companies exisring on the world market can offer their services at a nuiTiber of users simultaneously conr.ected not exceeding 50,000 {on the US market) and 20,000 (on the European market) . It should be pointed out that such a number of users is certainly lower by some orders of magnitude than the traditional television market.<br>
Moreover, the centralized management of the audio¬visual content transmission has serious implications on the use of the band offered by telephone companies.<br>
The connections used follow in fact a star pattern, from the exchange station connecting the main servers wherein the audio-visual contents are stored, to the periphery, where each connection reaches the single equipment of the final users, i.e. the subscribers to the service.<br>
This  kind  of  connection,  linked  to  the  kind  of interaction between the periphei"al devices installed<br><br>
wi.r.n rhe final users and the central servers, provides tha.^ cl-.e connections near the central servers are always overloaded by transmissions, since all the dana gc through the central servers while the peripheral ccnneccions or branches, for exampla between a commune and che quarters thereof or between a quarrer and the blccks thereof, are almost underused since they must only support the transit of the data senc to the few users simultaneously connected to that particular peripheral branch.<br>
Morecver the quantity of programs which are available to the final user in teirms of programming hours depends on the storage capacity of the servers offered by the company managing the  on-demand video  service.<br>
At present, all the main operators can provide an audio-visual content volume varying from 100 and 200 progranting hours. These audio-visual contents are usually renewed one per month.<br>
Finally it should be noted that, given the kind of technology developed and installed with the final user, each user can receive only one television program a time, according to a reality being very far from the real condition of a west average family which, can have more than one television set per house.<br>
In fact, the devices which are presently installed with the customers do not have a high processing capacity and they are limited to receiving the signal sent by the   central   system.<br>
The technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide a method for managing audio-visual contends   on  dicital  networks   and  a   corresponding system<br><br>
for managing these audio-visual contents with the final users, having such structural and f-L-uictional characteristics  as  to  allow  an  cn-de:r,and  mode<br><br>
.a<br>
distribution utcn rsoiiest c£ ths final user overccuiini<br>
the lin'.itations and drawbacks which still lit^it the on-de^r^and video ser-zices realized according tc the prior art.<br>
Disclosure Q£ Invantion<br>
The solutive idea underlying the present invention is to distribute the audio-visual contents on a plurality of storage means of devices connected through a peer-to-peer network so to allcw an audio-visual content selected by a final user to be collected and displayed in the equipraent ox that user.<br>
Based or. this solutive idea the technical -problem is solved by e method for managing audio-visual contents as previously described and defined in the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The problem is also solved by a system for managing audio-visual contents as previously described and defined in the characterizing part of claim 15.<br>
The features and advantages of the method and system for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention will be apparent from the following description of an embodiment thereof given by way of non-limiting exanrole with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
In the drawings:<br><br>
Figure 1 schematically■ shews a system fcr managing<br>
audi c-visual        contents        which        is	sui::able        for<br>
implementing     zhe     meLhcd     for     managing     audio-visual<br>
contents   according  to   the   invention;<br>
Figure 2 scherr,atically shows a detail of the system of Figure   1;   snd<br>
Fig"^ire 3 schematically shows a further decail of the system  cf   Figure   1.<br>
Modes   for Carrying" Out   the   Invention<br>
With reference to the drawings, and particularly to Figure 1, a system for managing sudio-visual contents according to the invention is globally and schematically indicated with ID.<br>
In     particular,       the      managing      system      10      collects, processes   and   supplies    the   audio-visual   contents   on   a display device  in the equipment  of   a final   user.<br>
The system 10 for managing audio-visual contents advantageously comprises at least a first device 11 and a second device 12, interconnected thorough, a wireless network.<br>
In particular, the first device or router 11 provides for the supply of all the functions which, are required to transfer the audio-visual contents from the digital network directly in. the final user peripheral equipment which is equipped with the system 10 for managing audio-visual  contents  according  to   the   invention.<br>
The router 11 provides then the support for the communications between the peripheral equipment and the external   data   network (s)     13    to    which    this   peripheral<br><br>
equipment can be connected.<br>
The rcutsr 11 is also connected, for exaracle through a wireless network 14, to the second dsvice or piaver 12, which  implement  all  the  functions  rac^aired  for displaying Che selected audio-visual contents.<br>
In tha example shown in Figure 1, the player 12 is connected to a television set 15 wherein the selected audio-visual contents are displayed. It is also possible to consider the case of a peripheral equipment equipped with a plurality of television sets, each being equipped with a player 12.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the player 12 is also equipped with an access device, for example through an infrared control, allowing the user to access all the options for the display of audio-visual contents by the player 12 .<br>
The structure of the devices included in the system 10 for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention will be now examined in greater detail.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, the router 11 con^rises essentially a central processing unit IS, a central memory 17 and a mass memory 18. It interacts, through an input section 19, with external data networks 13 and, through an output section 20, to the wireless network 14 to dialogue with the player(s) 12 to which it must send the selected audio-visual contents.<br>
The connection to the wireless network 14 is made for example through suitable RF transmitting antennas.<br>
In particular, the central processing unit 15 manages the connections between the central raeraory 17 and the<br><br>
mass T.enaory 13,  as well as the cannaczicr.s    to the<br>
external data networks 13 through the input section 19 and to che wireless network 14 through the output section 20.<br>
Moreover, the programs for the router 11 operation and for the connection of the mass memory 13 to the ex-emal data networks 13 and to the wireless network<br>
14 =^2 resident in the central memory 17.<br>
It is actually possible to consider the ccrjiection of the router 11 to terrestrial broadband r.etworks, telephone-connected terrestrial networks, satellite networks and wireless networks.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the mass memory 18 of the router 11 provides a storage means being wide enough to store the audio-visual contents required by the user which should arrive dis continuously, in order to send them, with the required quality, to the player 12. In other words, the mass memory 18 of the router 11 plays the functions of a buffer, like the so-called computer cache memories.<br>
In such a way, the external data networks 13 connected to the router 11 are not required a transmission, capacity being high enoi^gh and time-granted to ensure the quality in displaying audio-visual contents to he sent in real time to a display device with the final user, like a television set 15.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the audio¬visual contents sent by the external data networks 13 to the router 11 can also arrive with an insufficient quality to be immediately provided on the television set 15.<br><br>
In particular, Che mass memory 13 of tiie router 11 provides for tile storage of all the audio-visual contents which are sent to the player 12 according to suicahle update logics. Advantageously according to the invencion, these update logics are not driven directly by che users, but they are processed seaming from their preferences in order co maximize the probability thac, when the user asks for a particular audio-visual content, the Latcer is already in the mass memory la of the router 11 thereof. In essence, the so-called pushing of audio-visual contents in the roucer network is performed.<br>
For example, in case of a user indicating the prafarence to receive the evening television news, the content of the mass memory la of the router 11 thereof is updated with the daily news, anticipating the user requests-<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the router 11 comprises a mass memory 18 suitable to ensure the storage of hundreds of continuous television prograiraning hours. This mass memory 18 is suitably split into two parts, according to criteria linked to the speed of the external networks 13 to which the router 11 is connected.<br>
In particular, a first part, or local memory ISA, is used exclusively by, the router 11 and the players 12 connected thereto though the wireless network 14. This local memory 18A is used exclusively by each final user to keep particular audio-visual contents promptly available for viewing.<br>
The audio-visual contents already included in the local memory 13A, are therefore the only contents which are<br><br>
immediately available ror viewing through all t'r.e local players 12, i.e. connected through the wireless network 14.<br>
A second part, or shared memory 16B, is shared with other routers 11 which can be reached through the external data networks 13 to which the router 11 is connected, according to a so-called peer-to-peer sharing pattern, i.e. a joint sharing pattern in which each router 11, or node of the peer-to-peer network, ser'/ss both as client and as server.<br>
The shared memory 18B is used to store audio-visual concents which can be reached by the final users. These audio-visual contents are not however repeated on all the shared memories of the routers connected to the network, but only on such a number ensuring that these audio-visual contents can be reached and that they are transferred at a right speed.<br>
In particular, the audio-visual contents stored in the shared memory 18B are repeated in order to:<br>
increase the probability that at least a physical location can be effectively reached at any time, even when a certain number of routers is off or anyway not accessible by the network it is connected thereto;<br>
split the transfer processes of the audio-visual contents existing in shared memories 18B of several routers - 11 to the local memory ISA of one or more routers 11 being different from the previous routers drawing the audio-visual contents simultaneously from as many routers 11 as possible which contain nhsm and which can be reached at a particular time, in order to reduce the output; traffic on the corresponding external<br><br>
da::a networks 13 of the routers sending the selected<br>
audic-visual concent to the router 11 demanding it.<br>
It shc\ild be noted that the peer-to-peer sharing pa-tern above-dsscribed for the sharing memories 18B of the rouzsrs 11, unless of a multiplicazivs constant reiazsd to the number of copies done for each audio-visual content, allows a linear increase cf the storage area being available to all the routers 11, wich the increase cf the number of the routers 11 installed and operating,<br>
Advancageously according to the invention, it is provided that the audio-visual contents kept in the local memories ISA of the routers 11 are continuously updated and modified, with a time schedule depending en the speed, even variable in time, of the external data networks 13 to which the routers 11 are connected. It is also provided that the updating politics take into consideration the user wishes, the information provided by the audio-visual content suppliers, the actual distribution of the audio-visual contents in reference on the different external data networks 13 and on the different routers 11 installed with the other final users.<br>
Only when a selected audio-visual content is available in the local memory ISA of the router 11 installed with the final user, then that audio-visual content is usable by the final user through one or more player 12 connected to one or more display devices, in particular television sets IS,<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the update politics are adjusted in order to foresee the final user's demands.<br><br>
For example,  preference is given "o the update of audio-visual cor.tents having mere recent information, en-sr::ainmen- programs preferred by the user on his specific indications, advertisements selectee according to geographic areas or to the interes.c for the user.<br>
Also the player 12 comprises essentially a central □recessing unit 21 and a central memory 22. Ic has also an interface 23 for connectien to the wireless network 14, as well ss a video oucput section 24 connected to an audic-visual content display device, in particular a traditional television set 15.<br>
In particular, the interface 23 comprises essentially a<br>
radiofrsquency-transmitting antenna.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the player 12 has not one's own mass memory, but it exploits directly the mass memory 18 of the router 11 whereto it is connected.<br>
The player 12 comprises also a control gate 25, for example an infrared gate, for interacting with an infrared remote control or eventually a wireless keyboard. It also comprises at least a digital input gate 2S and an analogue input gate 21 suitable to receive respectively external OUT_V video signals and OUT_A audio signals.<br>
In particular, the central processing unit 21 manages the input and output connections, particularly to the display device, for example the television set 15 through the video output section 24 and an infrared remote control or keyboard through the control gate 25.<br><br>
Mo<br>
irecve::, the central processing unit 21 manages the<br><br>
conneccions to the outside through input gates 26 and 27 .<br>
SiT.il=.rly to what has been considered for the routsr 11, nhe programs for the player 12 operation and for the connection of the mass memory 23 to the wireless 14 and to the television set 15 are resident in the central memory 22. In particular, these programs super^/ise the collection and processing of the audio¬visual contents received, as well as their transmission for a correct display on the television set.<br>
Essenzially, the player 12 provides for the audio¬visual contents and the configuration menus to be displayed directly on the screen of the television set 15, drawing all the necessary data from the central memory 17 and the mass memory IS of the router 11 whereto it is connected. If the player 12 is used to store new contents, it provides to transfer immediately all the data in the router 11 memory.<br>
It should be noted that the physical split of the system 10 for managing audio-visual contents in a router device 11 *and in a player device 12 allows the following advantages to be achieved:<br>
a. It eliminates the cable costs in the apartment to connect a single on-demand video device both to the external comniunication network and to the television set whereon the signal video are to be received.<br>
In particular, this cost is no more necessary even when the system 10 and the router 11 and player 12 devices are temporarily moved in a different room (for example, during a journey or summer holidays) .<br><br>
On che contrary, in traditional systems, the cable step of "he single aqiaipment is always necessary since the suprlisrs of communication and telephone systems neither take cheir terminal connections in the cuscc-.er's house not necessarily near the television sez, nor repeaz these connections for each television se:; in the house.<br>
b. It allows CO view several audio-visual contents, simultaneously on. different television sens, simply installing several player devices 12, all communicating with the same router 11, wherefrom they receive the video signals ■■■jithont need to repeat the connect ion to the external da-a network 13.<br>
This kind of solution allows several television programs to be displayed both on the same television set and on a ma:<irmim of twenty different television sets per apartruent which is impossible for the solutions actually sold on market.></irmim>
Advantageously according to the invention, the cornmimication between the router 11 and the player 12 occurs throughout the internal wireless network 14, which is not subtaitted to the traffic of external data, and is then sufficient to ensiore the required quality for an adequate viewing of the television contents<br>
The eventual viewing of more audio-visual contents on one or more television sets 15 will involve only the use of the internal wireless network 14, without charging the connecting network between the router 11 and the external data networks 13.<br>
The capacity of viewing several audio-visual concents a time  is  thus  a  fundamental  characteristic  which<br><br>
dist::.r.gi;ishes of the system 10 tor manaclng audio¬visual contents according to the invention wizh rsspecc to rhe products presently available on. the T.arke':.<br>
Morscver, it should be underlined that, to be able to supply similar services, the products actually sold on the n^ar^et should be connected only to broadband ne c wc rk = grant ing the qual i ty of c he si gnal transmitted, which are presently available in very few and liT.ited geographic areas. This is cne cf the reascns why this kind of services is not up to now diffused on large scale, the construction of these broadband networks requiring huge investments.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, centralized services are also provided, which are suitable for supporting some specific functions available to the final users of the system 10 for managing audio-visual contents.<br>
It is possible for example to provide a system for managing the charges of the amounts corresponding to the audio-visual content viewing and the credit deriving from the use of credit cards or prepaid cards.<br>
It is also possible to provide a centralized managing of the information useful for invoicing, controlling access rights to contents, the preferences of the final users, configuring the different players installed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the system<br>
10	for managing the audio-visual contents provides a<br>
load by the final user of tUe audio-visual contents in<br>
the shar=d memories ISB distributed on all the routers<br>
11	of -he network to which tlie final user is connected.<br><br>
In particular, the player 12 provides cc lead its ccntar.u in the shared memory ISB of the corresponding roucar 11. Then, on the basis of the indications provided by the audio-visn&amp;l content proprietor concerning his will to diffuse it in particular geographic areas or in areas of interest for the final users, the router 11 provides to diffuse it on the highest nuinber of peripheral routers, tak,ing into consideration all the parameters introduced.<br>
Virtually, therefore, anybody possessing a system 10 for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention can become a potential audio-visual content supplier. The speed at which he will be able to introduce his contents in the peer-to-peer net'jjork of all the router/player systems will depend on the speed of the network to which all the routers are connected.<br>
Having fiber optics networks with so-called content delivery systems offered by telephone companies, it is already possible to offer contents live on several router/player systems.<br>
The way in which audio-visual contents are diffused in the systems 10 for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention will now be examined.<br>
The index of the new audio-visual contents stored in the shared memories 18B of the routers 11 is recorded in central servers, the only for this technology, implementing the activities of license and invoice control as well as of content diffusion, on the basis of sta;:istical and configuration information, supplied from time to time by the final users, based on their preferences or their will to display pariiicular contends.<br><br>
It should be specified that che routers 11 are those in charge ct supervising the diffusion of the new audio¬visual conter.rs introduced in one or more routers.<br>
The final user selectis the audio-visual contents he wanes to display and he specifies the way in which he want re pay possible fee-paying contents, for example through charging on his account or through credit card.<br>
If the selected audio-visual content: is already resid^nc in the local memory 18A of the router 11 of the system 10 for managing audio-visual conten.cs installed at the final user's house, it is immediately available to the final user.<br>
Alternatively, if that audio-visual content is in the memory 133 shared between the different routers connected to the router 11 of the system 10 for managing audio-visual contents installed in the final user's house, the final user is informed about a possible delay which might occur before the use, depending on the speed at which the router 11 succeeds in drawing on the peer-to-peer network the required audio-visual content.<br>
It should be noted that, differently from a traditional centralized approach, wherein the audio-visual contents are all kept in central servers to which the customers access for viewing a television content, the system 10 for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention advantageoULsly distributes the audio-visual contents directly on the different peripheral memories of the systems installed with the final users who suhecrihed to the service.<br>
The  most  evident  advantages  of  this  audio-visual<br><br>
cor.'cnc distributed approach are the followir-c:<br>
1. The system 10 for managing audio-visual contents allows a huge scaling power (i.e. a capacity of growi-g) both in terms of number of available hours, and in carms of highest number of users siTnulraneously connected to a single system.<br>
In particular, the following table I shows a qualitative comparison between the system lo for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention and the traditional solutions.<br>

Proposed	It increases as the	Halimited<br>
distributed	number of users	<br>
system	connected increases	<br>
2. The system 10 for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention allows the peripheral residual band to be optimized. In particular, the audio-visual content distribution in the internal shared memories 18B of the single routers 11 installed with the final users allows an improved exploitation of the transmissive band available to the telecorrjnunication  companies   with  respect   to  a<br><br>
traditional central i:red solution since the single audio-visual contents from time to time required by the final user will not have to be drawn from the cennral servers but they will be already resident in the mass memory 13 of each router 11, or directly --^ith. the final user asking for it, or, less probable, in one of the routers installed near the user, and, still less probable, in routers still farther from the final user.<br>
The access mode to the audio-visual contents for the final users will now be described in greater detail.<br>
The player 12 installed in one or more television sets 15 of each final user allows the access to audio-visual contents which can be reached directly or through the peer-to-peer network by the router 11 essentially in two ways:<br>
1.	Surfing in a menu allowing to make	precise researches on the available audio-visual	contents according to different keys {i.e. title,	author, interpreters, genre, etc);<br>
2.	Defining personalised TV programs, i.e. a seguence of television contents characterized by genre or other parameters, which will be sent in sequence to the final user, just like a traditional television channel, without need to select from time to time the content he wants to view.<br>
It should be noted that the definition of personalised TV programs is in any case different from the traditional television program since in the system 10 according to the invention the audio-visual contents have been anyway selected in advance by the final user (setting his preferences), concerning both the contents<br><br>
and tne costs and oayment forms.<br>
The arove-described system 10 for managing audio-visual consents allows therefore a new method for managing audio-visual contents to be implemented.<br>
In particular, the method for managing audio-visual concents according to the invention coir.prises the following steps -,<br>
realizing a peer-to-peer network of a plurality of rou-er devices suitable for connection to external data networks and comprising audio-visual content storage means;<br>
providing at least one shared section of the audio-visual content storage means;<br>
sharing the shared sections of the audio-visual content storage means of the router devices; and<br>
distributing audio-visual contents in the storage means of the plurality of router devices.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, the method for managing audio-visual contents provides also the following steps:<br>
selecting an audio-visual content by a final user;<br>
collecting the selected audio-visual content from the plurality of storage means through the peer-to-peer network ,-<br>
storing the selected audio-visual content in at least one local section ox the audio-visual content storage means of the final user router;<br><br>
providing a plurality of player devices connected to corresponding router devices as well as to a final user display device;<br>
displaying the selected audio-visual content comprised .in the local section of the audio-visual contient storage means through the final user player device.<br>
In essence, the method for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention distributes the audio-visual concents directly in the distributed sections of the storage means of the router devices of the final users which subscribed to the service, it collects the audio-visual content selected by a final user through the peer-to-peer network and store it in the local section of the store devices of the final user router device and it allows the display thereof through the player device and a display device, for e3<araple a television set.></araple>
Advantageously according to the invention, the method for managing audio-visual contents provides also a step of updating the audio-visual contents comprised in the router devices of the peer-to-peer network of the users who subscribed to the service.<br>
In particular, this step of updating the audio-visual content occurs with a time schedule depending on the speed of the external data networks to which the router devices are connected.<br>
Advantageously according to the invention, it is provided that this update step is managed on" Che basis of the user wishes, the information provided by the audio-visual content suppliers, the actual distribution<br><br>
of tne audio-visual contents in reference on the different external data networks and on the differant router devices installed with other final users.<br>
Moreover, advantageously according to the invention, the update step is adjusted in order to fcresea the final user demands. In particular, the updats take into consideration the specifications supplied by the user. For example, in esse of interest for the news, it is more probable that he -wants to see today's neijs rather than yesterday's news.<br>
Moreover, the update implements an historical evaluation of the user preferences and detects his specific indications, For example, if a user specifies to prefer __ football, audio-visual contents linked to football, rather than to sailing, are preferably sent.<br>
Advantageously according Co the invention, the step of collecting the selected audio-visual content from the plurality of storage means through the peer-to-peer network, provides a split of the transfer process of the audio-visual contents stoz;ed in shared sections of several router devices to the local section of one or more router devices being different from the previous routers drawing the a-udio-visual contents simultaneously from as many router devices as possible which contain them and which can be reached at a particular time, in order to reduce the output traffic on the corresponding external data networks.<br>
Finally, the method for managing audio-visual contents according to the invention allows a load by the final user of the audio-visual contents in the shared sections distributed on all the routers of the network to  which  the  final  user  is  connected  and  the<br><br>
disrriisuticn thereof in the network by the router device on the basis of the indications provided bv the audic-visual content proprietor concerning his will to diffuse it in parcicular ceographic areas or in areas of inreresc for the final users.<br>
In concilusion, the system and the method for managing audio-visual ccnuents according to the invention can Euppiy television ccntencs with configurable quality and any^,^/ay higher than the present: traditional television quality in the on-demand mode, selected by the final user.<br>
The main advantages of the proposed solution are as<br>
follows:<br>
1.	The proposed system and method do not require the use of broadband networks for which the signal quality must be granted. For this reason, it is sometimes possible to use also satellite networks or not-broadband networks .<br>
2.	The proposed system and method optimize the exploitation of the broadband networks installed according to a star pattern, exploiting in a better way the peripheral residual bank which is not used and not introducing singularity points on the network. In fact they do not require centralized servers for storing audio-visual contents, thus reducing considerably the costs  for developing this  technology.<br>
3.	The proposed system and method are really<br>
scalable, in terms both of highest number of users<br>
simultaneously connected and of highest number of hours<br>
available through Che devices installed directly with<br>
the    final    users.      This     is     allowed    by    introducing    a<br><br>
distributed content pattern with, respect zc   z'r.e  present cer.trs-lized nattern used in ail the ctr.sr avaiiaiile<br><br><br>
