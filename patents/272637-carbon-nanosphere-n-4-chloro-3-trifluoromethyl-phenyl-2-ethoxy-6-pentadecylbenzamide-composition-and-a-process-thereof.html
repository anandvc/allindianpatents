FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in relation to the filed of Nanotechnology, More particularly, the present invention relates to the field of nanomaterials being used as delivery vehicles for introducing molecules into the cells, especially small molecule modulators of histone modifying enzymes. This has potential therapeutic uses in various diseases for targeted drug delivery.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diseases like cancer, AIDS, diabetes, asthma are the major causes of concern in developing countries like India. With the recent advances in nanoscience, it has been possible to employ nanoparticles to deliver the necessary drugs inside specific cancerous cells. A number of factors like permeability of the particles inside the cells, cytotoxicity, biodegradability, surface functional groups, fluorescence, economically viable synthetic methods must be considered for developing the nanoparticles for intracellular drug delivery applications. Most often the nanoparticles require several chemical modifications to load the concerned molecules on their surfaces. Furthermore, tracking the nanoparticles during the intracellular trafficking can be made possible only when they are fluorescently tagged. There is every likelihood that these modifications can change the biological fate of the nanoparticles. Though the transport of nucleic acids, proteins, peptides and drug molecules across the cell membrane using these nanoparticles/nanotubes have been demonstrated, their inefficiency to breach the nuclear membrane limits their use in many applications where the drug molecules should be delivered inside the nucleus. Treatment of diseases based on the reversiblel modifications of histones by HATs (histone acetyltransferase) and HDACs (histone deacetylases) whose dysfunction cause many diseases have become the new generation therapeutic targets. Therefore, it is highly important to develop new nanomaterials that can specifically enter the cancerous nuclei and deliver the molecules which can in turn influence (activate or inhibit) the chromatin modifiying enzymes.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The principle objective of the present invention is to prepare intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanospheres so as to achieve targeted drug delivery.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to develop a process for the preparation of<br>
intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanospheres.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to achieve intracellular delivery of active<br>
drug moieties followed by entry into the nucleus.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to achieve intranuclear delivery of p300<br>
histone acetyltransferase activator CTPB and other modulators of chromatin modifying<br>
enzymes.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to achieve carbon nanospheres which are<br>
intrinsically fluorescent and inherently surface functionalized.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly,   the  present   invention   provides  an   intrinsically  fluorescent  carbon<br>
nanosphere; a process for preparation of intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanosphere, said process comprising step of polymerization of sugar solution to obtain the intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanospheres; a composition comprising intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanospheres and active molecule(s), optionally along with acceptable excipients; a process for preparation of a composition comprising intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanospheres and active molecule(s), said process comprising step of adsorbing the active molecule(s) over the carbon nanospheres to obtain the composition; and a method of delivering active molecules inside a cell nucleus, said method comprising step of administering pre-determined amount of composition comprising intrinsically fluorescent carbon nanosphere and the active molecules, optionally along with acceptable additives.<br>

Use of nanomaterials in biology has opened doors to a better understanding of cellular processes through imaging and thereby improved therapeutic procedures especially in drug delivery.^ Nanoparticles such as silica,'* LDH clay,^ micelles,^ polymer nanoparticles' and carbon nanotubes^'^ are being actively explored for the intracellular drug delivery purpose. Most often these nanoparticles require several surface chemical modifications to attach the drug molecules and additional fluorescent tags'"' " that inevitably affects the cellular uptake and metabolism of the nanomaterial. Despite their use  in transporting  nucleic acids,  proteins,  and drug molecules across the cell<br><br>
membrane, the inefficiency to breach the nuclear membrane limits their use in many applications. On the other hand nuclear targeting carriers like peptides and polyethyleneimines face intense serum inhibition due to their highly positive charged surfaces.'^ Here we report, the carbon nanospheres (CSP)' derived from hydrothermal treatment of glucose overcome all the above shortcomings and enter the cell nuclei. Remarkably, these CSP are intrinsically fluorescent and do not require any additional fluorescent tags to track them inside the cells. Furthermore, the CSP are readily dispersible in water without any prior surface modifications and could successfully deliver a therapeutically potential, cell impermeable molecule, CTPB^ inside the nucleus.<br>
The Applicant hereby reports the following in the current invention:<br>
1.	Amorphous Carbon nanospheres which are inherently fluorescent.<br>
2.	These carbon spheres can be prepared by the hydrothermal decomposition of glucose at 180° C and can also be synthesized in the form of nanotubes by confining the reaction with in a porous membrane.<br>
3.	The carbon spheres (100- 500 nm) thus obtained are made up of dense hydrophobic core of polyaromatic units covered by layers of highly functional ized carbon chains of few nm thickness (functionalized with polymeric alcohols, salicylaldehyde groups and a,p unsaturated aldehydes) with negatively charged surface.<br>
4.	They are easily dispersed in water and many organic solvents like ethanol, toluene etc. The existence of both hydrophobic core and hydrophilic surface on the carbon spheres helps them to disperse easily in polar and non-polar solvents.<br>
5.	Photoluminescence studies on carbon spheres show a weak emission at 660 nm on excitation at 514 nm, attributed to the radiative relaxation of excited electrons (possibly due to the presence of conjugated aromatic systems). This helps to image the carbon spheres in the confocal microscope without the aid of any fluorescent tag over extended periods, which is an added advantage over the risks involved in the case of quantum dots or organic dyes.<br>
6.	The presence of optimum hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity enhances the cell<br>
internalization of carbon spheres. The entry of the carbon spheres inside the cells takes<br>
about 1 h and at 3 h they reach the perinuclear region followed by their entry into the<br>
nucleus.<br><br>
7. These carbon spheres were used to deliver the only known p300 histone acetyhransferase activator CTPB into the cells and thereby induce hyperacetylation and transcriptional activation.<br>
Further modifications of the nanospheres are underway so as to introduce specific targeting of the molecules. Therefore, this inherently fluorescent, easily permeable to the cell nuclei, carbon nanospheres will be highly useful as potential drug delivery vehicles.<br>

But, increased number of washing in water restores the zeta potential back to -24 mV suggesting weak adsorption, (h) EDX analysis of carbon spheres adsorbed with DNA after three cycles of washing with water<br>

The technology of the instant Application is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, the examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Example: 1<br>
The carbon nanospheres are prepared by hydrothermal decomposition of glucose at 180° C. Also, the same can be synthesized in the form of nanotubes by confining the reaction into a porous membrane. The carbon nanospheres thus obtained by hydrothermal decomposition possess a size ranging from 100- 500 nm and can be easily dispersed in water and many organic solvents like ethanol, toluene etc. Apart from glucose, other possible precursors which can be used are sucrose, fructose, cyclodextrin, maltose, starch and cellulose. Hence, all these possible precursors can be used to obtain carbon nanospheres of instant invention.<br>
In addition, the carbon nanospheres thus obtained are made up of dense hydrophobic core of polyaromatic units covered by layers of highly functionalized carbon chains of few nm thickness (functionalized with polymeric alcohols, salicylaldehyde groups and a,p unsaturated aldehydes) with negatively charged surface. The existence of both hydrophobic core and hydrophilic surface on the carbon spheres helps them to disperse easily in polar and non-polar solvents.<br>
Further, photoluminescence studies on carbon spheres show a weak emission at 560 nm on excitation at 514 nm, attributed to the radiative relaxation of excited electrons (possibly due to the presence of conjugated aromatic systems). This helps to image the carbon spheres in the confocal microscope without the aid of any fluorescent tag over extended periods, which is an added advantage over the risks involved in the case of quantum dots or organic dyes.<br>

'urthermore, the presence of optimum hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity enhances the ell internalization of carbon spheres. The entry of the carbon spheres inside the cells ikes about 1 h and at 3 h they reach the perinuclear region followed by their entry into ie nucleus. More particularly, these carbon spheres were used to deliver the only<br>
known p300 histone acetyltransferase activator CTPB into the cells and thereby induce<br>
hyperacetylation and transcriptional activation.<br>
Example: 2<br>
Figure la shows the FESEM image of the glucose-derived CSP of size 400 nm in diameter (Supporting Information S2). The CSP were easily dispersible in solvents such as water, ethanol and toluene suggesting the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups on the surface (Figure lb). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) image of the CSP was obtained by exciting the sample at 514 nm (Figure Ic). The emission spectrum displayed a broad band centered at 550 nm and a less intense band at 625 nm (Figure Id). The 550 nm emission had a stable intensity for about 1 h. The origin of emission at 550 nm is attributed to the surface functional groups'^ like carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, which indeed, disappeared when the functional groups were removed by heat treatment in nitrogen environment (Supporting Information S3).<br>
Method of preparation of Carbon nanosphere adsorbed with CTPB<br>
Carbon nanospheres at a concentration of 2 mg/mL were kept for adsorption onto CTPB (6 mM stock, 3 mg/mL) overnight in a methanol solution after which they were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with methanol. The sample was dried in air at 30 oC for 6 h. The CTPB adsorbed nanospheres were resuspended in 1 mL water and sonicated for 15 min. The fine suspension was used for all the experimental purposes. Similarly, carbon nanospheres adsorbed with DNA, polycations, peptides, antibodies, RNA and small molecules have been achieved. For experimental purpose, 2-3 month old swiss albino mice were used. Injections were given intraperitoneally. Injection volume was kept constant at 250 \iL.<br>
Adsorption of negatively charged molecule like DNA was studied on the surface of the carbon spheres. The adsorption of DNA was carried out by soaking 250 |ig dispersed in 10 ml of deionised water containing 5 mg of DNA, pH 7.3 showing signs of adsorption<br>
13<br><br>
of DNA on carbon spheres. But, increased number of washing in water restores the zeta potential back to -24 mV suggesting weak adsorption. [Fig: 2 (g)].<br>
The carbon sphere has been tested for the adsorption and binding characteristics with polycations and DNA. The following observation with the cations and DNA suggests the possibility of the carbon nanospheres of instant invention acting as a general carrier for nucleic acids and several small molecules by simple adsorption. The consequent nuclear targeting has been performed as performed for CSP-CTPB.<br>
Example: 3<br>
fhe time dependent entry of CSP inside the cell was monitored using CLSM and the results are shown in Figure 2a (panel I-IV). Entry of CSP inside the nucleus occurred within 3 h, and the extent of nuclear localization was found to increase with time. One of the major concerns regarding the cellular compatibility of carbon based nanoparticles is the toxicity. Therefore, any possible cytotoxicity of the CSP was tested by the MTS (Sodium salt of (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide))based assay system. The viable cells are capable of reducing the MTS salt to a water soluble formazan by the action of mitochondrial reductases.'' The yellow product obtained on reduction of MTS to formazan is estimated as a measure of cell viability. The presence of CSP within the nucleus did not cause any cytotoxicity even after 24 h of treatment as evident from the absorbance values which were constant throughout the experiment (Figure 2b, compare lane I with lanes II-VI). On the other hand, the known apoptosis inducing compound, plumbagin'^ lead to a drastic decrease in the absorbance values.<br>
The cellular entry of nanomaterials depends on the optimal concentration of hydrophilic groups"' on their surface. Besides, the surface charge of the nanoparticles also plays a pivotal role in negotiating with the cell membrane during the entry. As the cell membrane is negatively charged, only those nanoparticles that acquire partly neutral or positive charge at the membrane site can overcome the serum inhibition and expedite their entry.'^ Since the pH of the cellular compartments vary, the surface charge of the CSP at different pH was studied. The zeta potential of the CSP showed a charge reversal with increasing acidity. It varied from a value of-24 mV at pH 7.3 to -4 mV at pH 4 (Figure 2c). At pH 4, the surface potential had a good overlap in the<br>
14<br><br>
positive region (Figure 2d), probably due to the differences in dissociation constant of various carboxylic acid groups present on the surface. When the zeta potential was measured in the cell medium containing serum and other inorganic salts at pH 7.3, a rapid adsorption of inorganic cations (Na^) occurred on the negatively charged CSP decreasing its potential to -17 mV within 30 min (Figure 2e). Both these factors which modulate the surface charge of CSP facilitate its entry into the cells.<br>
In the cell nucleus, CSP come in close proximity to the highly compact and dynamic nucleoprotein structure, chromatin, composed of DNA, RNA and different proteins (histones and nonhistones). Reversible acetylation of chromatin proteins, predominantly histones by Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) play a significant role in the dynamicity of chromatin thus regulate transcription, replication and repair.'^ During normal conditions, the enzymatic activity of HATs and HDACs regulate chromatin and transcription factor acetylation in a controlled fashion whereas their imbalance leads to diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma.'^ The well-known new generation drug candidates<br>
9(1<br>
are the HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). These drugs indirectly induce hyperacetylation which is predominantly nonspecific in nature. Direct activation of a specific HAT is therefore a promising alternative.^' The only known small molecule HAT activator which could be useful in this context is CTPB^. However, its impermeability to the human cells limits its use for molecular probing and therapeutic purposes. Thus, a carrier capable of localizing CTPB directly into the nucleus could circumvent the limitations of HDACi leading to a high therapeutic efficacy.<br>
Example: 4<br>
The nuclear targeted entry of CSP was effectively used to carry CTPB (Figure 3a) inside the mammalian cell nuclei. CTPB was physically adsorbed on the surface of CSP. Energy Dispersive X-ray mapping of the CSP adsorbed with CTPB (Figure 3b) shows the uniform distribution of the fluorine signal (red region, Panel IV) suggesting the efficient adsorption of CTPB on the surface (For further information, see supporting information, methods). The uptake of CSP and the CTPB adsorbed CSP (CTPB-CSP) by the mammalian cells was monitored by immunofluorescence analysis using acetylated H3 antibody. The intensity of Hoechst stained HeLa cells and the fluorescence from CSP (Figure 3c I, 3c II) were used as controls. Since CTPB, as such<br>
15<br><br>
is impermeable to the cell membrane, the hyperacetyiation observed in the absence or presence of CTPB alone, did not show any difference (Figure 3c III, 3c IV). As expected, CSP alone could not alter the acetylation level even after their entry into the nucleus (Figure 3d, I). On the other hand, addition of CTPB-CSP showed a remarkable 3-4 fold increase in the localized fluorescence intensity of the acetylated H3 antibody (Figure 3d III, 3d IV) which is comparable to the level of activity (hyperacetyiation) of HDACi like trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBu) (Figure 3d II).<br>
Example: 5<br>
Immunoblot analysis further confirmed that the CTPB-CSP could induce hyperacetyiation of 2.5 fold over the CSP treated cells (Figure 4a, Panel I, lane 2 and 3). As expected a dramatic hyperacetyiation was observed on treating with the HDACi, trichostatin A and Sodium butyrate (lanel). We have also found that CTPB-CSP induces autoacetylation of p300 in the HeLa cells (Figure 4b, 4c) as probed with specific antibody for acetylated p300 (Supporting Information S4). Autoacetylation of p300 enhances its HAT activity^^. Thus, induction of autoacetylation by CTPB could be the possible molecular mechanism to increase the histone acetylation. The hyperacetyiation of chromatin proteins (predominantly histones), induces the transcriptional activity which could be monitored by the recruitment of transcription machineries such as RNA polymerase 11.^^ Significantly, we found that CTPB-CSP could not only induce hyperacetyiation in its proximal chromatin domain but also increase the recruitment of RNA polymerase II, as evidenced by immunofluorescence images using antibodies against RNA polymerase II (Figure 4d). The CTPB-CSP treated cells show an approximately three-fold increase in fluorescence intensity as compared to the CSP treated cells (Figure 4e, pink line vs red line). To further validate the hyperacetyiation followed by RNA polymerase II recruitment, the expression of a gene (ATF6), known to be upregulated by p300 mediated acetylation^'* was investigated by Real Time PCR analysis. As expected, hyperacetyiation indeed, induce the expression of ATF6 (2 fold) in a physiologically significant manner (Figure 4f). These data establish the functional significance of the CTPB-CSP induced hyperacetyiation.<br>
16<br><br>
Example: 6<br>
The permeability of CSP was also investigated in mouse model. Mice were injected with nanospheres and were sacrificed after 72 h. The localization of nanospheres in the animal tissues was detected by imaging the fluorescence of the nanospheres (Figure 5a). The presence of carbon spheres in the brain was found to be highest followed by spleen and liver (Figure 5b) which was also confirmed by Raman spectrum of a single cell of the fixed animal tissue. Raman Spectrum of CSP has two broad bands at 1340 and 1550 cm"' (Figure 5c I) which are assigned to the disordered and graphitic structures respectively.'^^ The Raman spectra of the tissues without CSP are given in Figure 5c (II, IV and VI). These spectra exhibited a broad band centering around 1440 cm' and a sharp band at 1650 cm' arising from the intracellular proteins. The localization of CSP within the cell is confirmed by the presence of bands corresponding to the CSP as shown in Figure 5c (III, V and VII). A remarkable observation in this context is the ability of 400nm CSP to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). There are very few examples of such a large sized particle crossing the BBB. It is well known that the penetration of substances into the brain is limited by the BBB which is formed by the endothelium of brain vessels, the basal membrane and neuroglial cells. Because of this, most drugs do not pass the BBB. It is widely accepted that compounds which are unionized at physiological pH and of low molecular mass can cross the BBB by diffusion mechanisms and other compounds such as amino acids, and hexoses pass into the brain through the specific carriers. A lot of efforts are being put by researchers to make nanoparticles cross the BBB. It has been shown that nanoparticles as large as 300-350 nm have been shown to cross the BBB when coated with glucose derivatives like dextran or polysorbate ^^'^'•^^ in agreement with this, since the CSP are also glucose-derived, the mechanism involved might be similar. The glucose derived CSP could form a complex with certain RNA-protein machineries within the cells facilitating its BBB entry. A detailed study is however essential to conclude the mechanism of uptake across BBB.<br>
Example: 7<br>
Furthermore, there was an effective uptake of CTPB-CSP in mice. Tissue sections of the brain of mice sacrificed after 72 h of treatment with CTPB-CSP was subjected to immunohistochemistry    with    antibody    against    acetylated    histone    H3.    The<br>
17<br><br>
mmunostained tissue section appears brown due to precipitation of DAB (3',3'-liaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride). The tissue from CTPB-CSP treated mice howed an increase in acetylation as compared to the tissue from the CSP treated mice Figure 5d, Panel II vs panel I). This clearly indicates that CTPB introduced into the inimals via CSP could induce hyperacetylation in vivo. As in the cellular system, the "SP in animals do not induce any toxicity as the mice were monitored for about 10 lays after injection. The mice were healthy even at the time of sacrifice. The netabolically active organ, liver showed absolutely no CSP after 6 days. The brain issue retained a minimal amount of carbon nanospheres after 9 days whereas kidney issue showed the presence of CSP for 6 days only (Figure 5e). These observations learly indicate that the CSP are nontoxic to the animals and are being actively turned iver in the system.<br>
although the HDAC inhibitors are involved in HAT activation albeit an indirect<br>
lanner, they are generally nonspecific and therefore could be relatively toxic in nature.<br>
his is due to the functional redundancy that exists among the HDACs thereby making<br>
: difficult to have specific HDACi. Recently, it has been shown that HDACi   impairs<br>
lale meiosis in mice thus resulting in reproductive defects.^^ There are several cases<br>
-.ke neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer, where<br>
specific HATs (eg. p300/CBP) are involved in the process of disease manifestation.<br>
Therefore,  drug  molecules  targeting  specific  HAT  should  be  advantageous.   In<br>
conclusion, the CSP described here are unique molecular transporters owing to their<br>
intrinsic  fluorescence,  surface  functionalisation,  non-toxicity and  green  synthetic<br>
method.   The   affinity  of carbon  spheres  for  positively  charged  molecules   like<br>
polycations (Supporting Information S5) and negatively charged molecules (e.g. DNA;<br>
Supporting Information S6) widen the scope of their use. Its immense potential in<br>
nuclear-targeted entry has been harnessed by trafficking the cell impermeable HAT<br>
activator CTPB, which in turn could induce hyperacetylation in vivo leading to<br>
transcriptional  activation,  giving a positive  impetus to the  field of therapeutics<br>
involving direct HAT activation.<br>
