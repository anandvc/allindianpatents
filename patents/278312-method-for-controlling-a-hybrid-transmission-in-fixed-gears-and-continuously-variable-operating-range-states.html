				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE A PREFERRED OUTPUT TORQUE IN MODE AND FIXED GEAR OPERATION WITH CLUTCH TORQUE CONSTRAINTS FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,404 filed on 11/05/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known hybrid powertrain architectures include torque-generative<br>
devices, including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which<br>
transfer torque through a transmission device to an output member. One<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving tractive<br>
torque from a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion<br>
engine, and an output member. The output member can be operatively<br>
connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle for transferring tractive torque<br>
thereto. Electric machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a<br>
<br>
 <br>
torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle<br>
kinetic energy, transferred through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy<br>
that is storable in an electrical energy storage device. A control system<br>
monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange among the<br>
electrical energy storage device and the electric machines to manage outputs<br>
of the transmission, including torque and rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A hybrid transmission is operative to transfer torque between an<br>
input member and torque machines and an output member in one of a plurality<br>
of fixed gear and continuously variable operating range states through<br>
selective application of torque transfer clutches. The torque machines are<br>
operative to transfer power from an energy storage device. A method for<br>
controlling the hybrid transmission includes operating the hybrid transmission<br>
in one of the operating range states, determining a first set of internal system<br>
constraints on output torque transferred to the output member, determining a<br>
second set of internal system constraints on the output torque transferred to the<br>
output member, and determining an allowable output torque range that is<br>
achievable within the first set of internal system constraints and the second set<br>
of internal system constraints on the output torque transferred to the output<br>
member.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain. The exemplary hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine<br>
14 and torque machines comprising first and second electric machines ('MG-<br>
A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 each generate mechanical power which can be transferred<br>
to the transmission 10. The enginel4, transmission 10 and the torque<br>
machines comprising the first and second electric machines in this<br>
embodiment comprise torque actuators. The power generated by the engine<br>
14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br>
herein as TI, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA,<br>
and NB, respectively.<br>
[0016] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the<br>
<br>
 <br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0017] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit ('HYD') 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0018] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
<br>
 <br>
[0019] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively.<br>
[0020] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed NO and an output<br>
torque To- A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed,<br>
<br>
 <br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control,<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0021] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torque commands TA and TB. Electrical current is<br>
transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged.<br>
[0022] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the motor<br>
torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regenerative functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA<br>
and TB- The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to<br>
<br>
 <br>
AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive<br>
control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States<br>
of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0023] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
<br>
 <br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0024] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including<br>
e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0025] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
<br>
 <br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torque commands TA<br>
and TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0026] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, TI, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0027] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
<br>
 <br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75.<br>
and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow,<br>
[0028] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX<br>
[0029] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0030] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
<br>
 <br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0031] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several states that can be described in terms of engine states comprising one of<br>
an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'), and transmission<br>
operating range states comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0032] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
 <br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('GT) is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0033] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
torque-generative devices comprising the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output<br>
member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from<br>
the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 determines the operator torque request, the output torque commanded from<br>
the transmission 10 to the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14,<br>
clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of<br>
the transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0034] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The engine state and<br>
<br>
 <br>
the transmission operating range state are determined based upon operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The transmission operating<br>
range state and the engine state may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque<br>
generating mode. The transmission operating range state and the engine state<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines<br>
optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery<br>
state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and<br>
determines the power output from the transmission 10 at output member 64<br>
that is required to meet the operator torque request while meeting other<br>
powertrain operating demands, e.g., charging the ESD 74. As should be<br>
apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power<br>
flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are<br>
 <br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to transfer power therebetween to generate a<br>
power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0035] Fig. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned control<br>
modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The control<br>
system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain systems<br>
having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and multiple electric machines. Alternatively, the<br>
hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque machines and energy<br>
storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical hybrid transmissions using<br>
hydraulically powered torque machines (not shown).<br>
[0036] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request<br>
('Toreq'). Operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored<br>
to determine the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). A strategic<br>
optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a preferred<br>
input speed ('Ni_Des') and a preferred engine state and transmission operating<br>
range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed and the<br>
operator torque request, and optimized based upon other operating parameters<br>
of the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and response limits of<br>
the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72. The strategic optimization control scheme 310 is preferably<br>
<br>
 <br>
executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop<br>
cycle. The desired operating range state for the transmission 10 and the<br>
desired input speed from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 are inputs to the<br>
shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320.<br>
[0037] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation (Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('Ni_Prof) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle. The engine operating commands<br>
and the operator torque request are based upon the input speed profile during a<br>
transition in the operating range state of the transmission. A clutch torque<br>
('Tel') for each clutch is estimated in the TCM 17, including the presently<br>
applied clutches and the non-applied clutches.<br>
[0038] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the<br>
<br>
 <br>
present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also<br>
include engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a<br>
cylinder deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders<br>
are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state<br>
and a fuel cutoff state. A present engine input torque ('Ti') reacting with the<br>
input member 12 is determined in the ECM 23.<br>
[0039] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('To_cmd'). This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA\ 'TB') to transfer a net output torque to the<br>
output member 64 of the transmission 10 that meets the operator torque<br>
request, by controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in this<br>
embodiment. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the immediate<br>
brake output torque request, the present input torque from the engine 14 and<br>
the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the present operating range state of the<br>
transmission 10, the input speed, the input speed profile, and the axle torque<br>
response type are inputs. The output and motor torque determination scheme<br>
340 executes to determine the motor torque commands during each iteration of<br>
one of the loop cycles. The output and motor torque determination scheme<br>
340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly executed during the 6.25 ms<br>
and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0040] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to generate tractive<br>
torque at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the<br>
operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position<br>
<br>
 <br>
of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
the output torque to the output member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0041] Operation of the engine 14 and transmission 10 is constrained by<br>
power, torque and rotational speed limits of the engine 14, the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, the ESD 74 and the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3<br>
73, and C4 75. The operating constraints on the engine 14 and transmission<br>
10 can be translated to a set of system constraint equations executed as one or<br>
more algorithms in one of the control modules, e.g., the HCP 5.<br>
[0042] Referring again to Fig. 1, in overall operation, the transmission 10<br>
operates in one of the operating range states through selective actuation of the<br>
torque-transfer clutches in one embodiment. Torque constraints for each of<br>
the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and speed<br>
constraints for the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 are determined. Battery power constraints for the ESD 74, i.e., the<br>
available battery power is determined, and applied to further limit operation of<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The preferred operating<br>
region for the powertrain is determined using the system constraint equations<br>
<br>
 <br>
that are based upon the battery power constraints, the motor torque constraints,<br>
the speed constraints, and clutch reactive torque constraints. The preferred<br>
operating region comprises a range of permissible operating torques or speeds<br>
for the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. By<br>
deriving and simultaneously solving dynamics equations of the transmission<br>
10, the torque limit, in this embodiment the output torque T0, can be<br>
determined using linear equations including: the following.<br>
TM1 = TAtoTM1*TA + TBtoTM1 *TB + Misc_TM1;	[1]<br>
TM2= TAtoTM2*TA+TBtoTM2*TB + Misc_TM2;	[2]<br>
Tm= TAtoTM3*TA+ TBtoTM3 *TB + Misc_TM3	[3]<br>
[0043] In one embodiment, the torque values include: TM1 representing the<br>
output torque T0 at output member 64, TM2 representing the input torque TI at<br>
input shaft 12, and TM3 representing the clutch torque(s) for the applied<br>
torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10;<br>
[0044]	The factors TAtoTM1, TAtoTM2, and TAtoTM3 are contributing<br>
factors of TAto TM1, TM2, TM3, respectively. The factors TBtoTM1, TBtoTM2,<br>
and TBtoTM3 are contributing factors of TB to TM1, TM2, TM3, respectively. The<br>
factors Misc_TM1, Misc_TM2, and Misc_TM3 are constants which contribute to<br>
TMI, TM2, TM3 by non TA, TB, TM1, TM2 and TM3 parameters such as time-rate<br>
changes in speed of the input member 12, time-rate changes in speed of the<br>
output member 64, and slip speed(s) of the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2<br>
<br>
 <br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 depending on the applications, and are described herein. The<br>
torque parameters TA and TB are the motor torques from the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The torque parameters TM1, TM2, TM3 can be any<br>
three independent parameters, depending upon the operating range state and<br>
the application.<br>
[0045} The engine 14 and transmission 10 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 have speed constraints, torque constraints, and battery<br>
power constraints due to mechanical and system limitations. The speed<br>
constraints can include engine input speed constraints of NI = 0 (engine off<br>
state), and NI ranging from 600 rpm (idle) to 6000 rpm for the engine 14.<br>
Exemplary speed constraints for the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 for this embodiment can be:<br>
-10,500 rpm ≤ NA≤ +10,500 rpm, and,<br>
-10,500 rpm ≤ NB ≤ +10,500 rpm,<br>
and can vary based upon operating conditions. The torque constraints include<br>
engine input torque constraints to the input member 12, comprising TI-MIN ≤TI<br>
≤TI_MAX- The torque constraints include motor torque constraints for the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 comprising maximum and minimum<br>
motor torques for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TA MAX",<br>
'TA_MIN', 'TB_MAX', 'TB_MIN') that are preferably obtained from data sets stored<br>
in tabular format within one of the memory devices of one of the control<br>
modules. Such data sets are empirically derived from dynamometer testing of<br>
the combined motor and power electronics, e.g., the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 and the TPIM 19, at various temperature and voltage<br>
conditions. The motor torque outputs of the first and second electric machines<br>
<br>
 <br>
56 and 72 are set such that TA_MIN ≤ TA ≤ TA_MAX and TB_MIN ≤TB ≤TB_MAX. and<br>
are dependent upon motor speed. The torque limits comprise torque curves<br>
that are speed-based. The motor torque constraints TA_MAX and 1A_MIN<br>
comprise torque limits for the first electric machine 56 when working as a<br>
torque-generative motor and an electric generator, respectively. The motor<br>
torque constraints TB_MAX and TB__MIN comprise torque limits for the second<br>
electric machine 72 when working as a torque-generative motor and an<br>
electrical generator, respectively. The term PBAT_MIN is the maximum<br>
allowable charging power of the ESD 74 and PBAT MAX is the maximum<br>
allowable battery discharging power of the ESD 74, with the limits imposed<br>
based upon factors related to durability and charge capacity of the ESD 74.<br>
[0046] An operating range, comprising a torque output range is<br>
determinable based upon the battery power constraints of the ESD 74.<br>
Calculation of battery power usage, PBAT is as follows:<br>
PBAT = PA.ELEC + PB.ELEC + PDC_LOAD	[4]<br>
wherein PA,ELEC comprises electrical power from the first electric machine 56,<br>
PB.ELEC comprises electrical power from the second electric machine<br>
72, and<br>
PDC_LOAD comprises known DC load, including accessory loads.<br>
Substituting equations for PA,ELEC and PB.ELEC, yields the following equation:<br>
PBAT = (PA,MECH + PA,LOSS) + (PB.MECH + PB.LOSS) + PDC_LOAD	[5]<br>
 <br>
wherein PA,MECH comprises mechanical power from the first electric machine<br>
56,<br>
PA.LOSS comprises power losses from the first electric machine 56,<br>
PB,MECH comprises mechanical power from the second electric<br>
machine 72, and<br>
PB.LOSS comprises power losses from the second electric machine 72.<br>
[0047] Eq. 5 can be restated as Eq. 6, below, wherein speeds, NA and NB,<br>
and torques, TA and TB, are substituted for powers PA and PB. This includes an<br>
assumption that motor and inverter losses can be mathematically modeled as a<br>
quadratic equation based upon torque, as follows:<br>
PBAT = (NA TA + (a, (NA) TA 2 + a2(NA) TA + a3(NA)))	[6]<br>
+ (NB TB + (B,(NB) TB2 + B2(NB) TB + B3(NB))) + PDC_LOAD<br>
wherein NA, NB comprise motor speeds for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72,<br>
TA, TB comprise the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, and<br>
a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 each comprise quadratic coefficients which are<br>
a function of respective motor speeds, NA, NB.<br>
[0048] This can be restated as follows:<br>
PBAT = a, * TA 2 + (NA+ a2)* TA + b1 * TB2 + (NB + b2) * TB	[7]<br>
+ a3 + b3 + PDC_LOAD<br>
 <br>
PBAT = a, [TA2 + TA(NA + a2)/a1 + ((NA + a2)/(2*a1 ))2]	[8]<br>
+ b1[TB2 + TB(NB+ b2)/b, + ((NB+ b2)/(2*b1))2]<br>
+ a3 + b3 + PDC_LOAD - (NA + a2)2/(4*a1) - (NB + b2)2/(4*b1)<br>
[0050] This reduces to:<br>
PBAT = a, [TA + (NA + a2)/(2*a1)]2 + b, [TB + (NB + b2)/(2*b1)]2	[9]<br>
+ a3 + b3 + PDC.LOAD - (NA + a2)2/(4*a1) - (NB + b2)2/(4*b1)<br>
[0051] This reduces to:<br>
PBAT = [SQRT(a,) * TA+ (NA + a2)/(2*SQRT(a1))]2	[10]<br>
+ [SQRT(b1) * TB+ (NB + b2)/(2*SQRT(b1))]2<br>
+ a3 + b3 + PDC.LOAD - (NA + a2)2/(4*a1) - (NB + b2)2/(4*b1)<br>
[0052] This reduces to:<br>
PBAT = (A1* TA +A2)2+ (B1* TB + B2)2 + C	[11]<br>
wherein A1 = SQRT(a,),<br>
B1 = SQRT(b,),<br>
A2 = (NA + a2)/(2*SQRT(a,)),<br>
B2 = (NB + b2)/(2*SQRT(b,)), and<br>
C = a3 + b3 + PDC_LOAD - (NA + a2)2/(4*a,) - (NB + b2)2/(4*b1).<br>
 <br>
This can be restated as:<br>
PBAT = PA_ELEC + PB_ELEC + PDC^LOAD	[HA]<br>
wherein PA _ELEC = (A1 *TA + A2)2 + CA, and<br>
PB_ELEC=(BI*TB + B2)2 + CB<br>
wherein CA = a3 - (NA + a2)2/(4*a1) and<br>
CB = b3-(NB + b2)2/(4*b1),and<br>
C = CA + CB + PDC_LOAD<br>
[0053] The motor torques TA and TB can be transformed to the Tx and TY<br>
as follows:<br>
 <br>
wherein Tx is the transformation of TA,<br>
Ty is the transformation of TB, and<br>
A1, A2, B1, B2 comprise application-specific scalar values.<br>
[0054] Eq. 11 further reduces to the following.<br>
PBAT=(TX2+TY2) + C	[13]<br>
 <br>
PBAT=R2+C	[14]<br>
[0055] Eq. 12 specifies the transformation of motor torque, TA to Tx and<br>
the transformation of motor torque TB to TY. Thus, a new coordinate system<br>
referred to as Tx/Ty space is defined, and Eq. 13 comprises battery power PBAT<br>
transformed into Tx/Ty space. Therefore, the available battery power between<br>
maximum and minimum battery powers PBAT MAX and PBATMIN can be<br>
calculated and graphed as radii ('RMAX' and 'RMIN') with a center at locus (0,<br>
0) in the Tx/Ty space, and designated by the letter K, wherein:<br>
RMIN = SQRT(PBAT_MIN - C)<br>
RMAX = SQRT(PBAT_MAX-C)<br>
[0056] The minimum and maximum battery powers, PBAT_MIN and<br>
PBAT__MAX, are preferably correlated to various conditions, e.g. state of charge,<br>
temperature, voltage and usage (amp-hour/hour). The parameter C, above, is<br>
defined as the absolute minimum possible battery power at given motor<br>
speeds, NA, NB, ignoring motor torque limits. Physically, when TA=0 and<br>
TB=0 the mechanical output power from the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 is zero. Physically Tx= 0 and Ty= 0 corresponds to a maximum<br>
charging power condition for the ESD 74. The positive sign ('+') is defined as<br>
discharging power from the ESD 74, and the negative sign ('-") is defined as<br>
charging power into the ESD 74. RMAX defines a maximum battery power<br>
 <br>
typically a discharging power, and RMIN defines a minimum battery power,<br>
typically a charging power.<br>
[0057] The forgoing transformations to the TX/TY space, designated by a<br>
second coordinate system K, are shown in Fig. 4, with representations of the<br>
battery power constraints as concentric circles having radii of RMIN and RMAX<br>
('Battery Power Constraints'), and linear representations of the motor torque<br>
constraints ('Motor Torque Constraints') circumscribing an allowable<br>
operating region. Analytically, the transformed vector [Tx/Ty] determined in<br>
Eq. 12 is solved simultaneously with the vector defined in Eq. 13 to identify a<br>
range of allowable torques in the Tx/Ty space which are made up of motor<br>
torques TA and TB constrained by the minimum and maximum battery powers<br>
PBAT MIN to PBAT_MAX- The range of allowable motor torques in the Tx/Ty<br>
space is shown with reference to Fig. 4, wherein points A, B, C, D, and E<br>
represent the bounds, and lines and radii are defined. A first coordinate<br>
system L depicts TA/TB space in relationship to the Tx/Ty space.<br>
[0058] Figs. 5A and 5B schematically show a control scheme and Figs. 6A<br>
and 6B graphically shows operation of the control scheme of Figs. 5 A and 5B<br>
for determining a preferred output torque from a powertrain system having<br>
multiple torque-generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to<br>
the powertrain system depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, residing in the<br>
aforementioned control modules in the form of executable algorithms and<br>
calibrations, and preferably used in the control system architecture of Fig. 3.<br>
[0059] Fig. 5 A depicts operation in one of the continuously variable mode<br>
operating range states. During ongoing operation in one of the mode<br>
operating range states, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the<br>
<br>
 <br>
brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request. The<br>
system calculates offset motor torques based upon inputs including the<br>
operating range state of the transmission 10, the input torque and terms based<br>
upon system inertias, system damping, and clutch slippage (TA Misc Opt'. 'TB<br>
Misc Opt', "TCL1 Misc Opt') described hereinbelow with reference to Eqs.<br>
17, 18, and 19 (510). The term 'CL1' designates a first applied clutch, i.e.,<br>
one of clutches C1 70 and C2 62 in the embodiment described, and TCLT is<br>
the torque transferred across CL1. The offset motor torques and clutch torque<br>
are inputs to calculate linear torque constraints to the output torque (520) and<br>
calculate an unconstrained quadratic solution to the output torque (530)<br>
[0060] The unconstrained quadratic solution to the output torque (530) is<br>
calculated using the power limits for the ESD 74, i.e., the available battery<br>
power PBAT MIN to PBATMAX, the offset motor torque constraints, motor torque<br>
characteristics defined in terms of coefficients for converting between<br>
mechanical torque and electric power in terms of efficiency and power loss in<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('Donut Space Coefficients'),<br>
and other scalar terms related to the torque outputs from the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 and the reactive torque of the applied clutch ('KTA<br>
from TO', 'KTB from To', 'KTCL1 from To')- The aforementioned inputs are used to<br>
calculate a first constraint on the output torque from the transmission 10,<br>
comprising the unconstrained quadratic solution, which includes an optimized<br>
output torque ('To*') and an optimized battery power ('P*BAT') for operating<br>
the system without concern for other constraints on the system. The power<br>
for the energy storage device 74 can be represented mathematically as a<br>
function of the transmission output torque To as shown in Eq. 15.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein a1 and b1 represent scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application. Eq. 15 can be solved for the output torque, as shown in Eq. 16:<br>
 <br>
[0061] For the available battery power range PBAT MIN to PBAT_MAX- four<br>
distinct output torques can be determined from Eq. 16, including maximum<br>
and minimum quadratic output torque constraints for the positive root case<br>
(To@PBATMax Opt (Pos Root)' and 'To@PBATMin Opt (Pos Root)'), and<br>
minimum and maximum quadratic output torque constraints for the negative<br>
root case (To@PBATMax Opt (Neg Root)' and 'To@PBATMin Opt (Neg<br>
Root)'), plotted with reference to Fig. 6A. Fig. 6A shows valid, i.e.,<br>
achievable ranges of output torque determined based the battery power<br>
constraints.<br>
[0062] The linear torque constraints to the output torque, i.e., minimum<br>
and maximum linear output torques ('To Min Linear', 'To Max Linear') (520)<br>
are determined based upon the offset motor torques, the scalar terms related to<br>
the motor torques from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and<br>
the reactive torque of the applied clutch ('KTA from To', 'KTB from TO', 'KTCLI from<br>
To'), the motor torque constraints comprising minimum and maximum motor<br>
<br>
 <br>
torque limits of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Minimum<br>
and maximum clutch reactive torques for applied clutch(es) CL1 (and CL2)<br>
are graphed relative to the motor torque constraints, for first and, as shown<br>
(where necessary) second applied clutches ('TCL1 MIN', 'TCL1 MAX') and<br>
('TCL2MIN','TCL2MAX').<br>
[0063] Fig. 6B graphically shows determining minimum and maximum<br>
linear output torques ('To Min Lin', 'To Max Lin') based upon the offset<br>
motor torques, the minimum and maximum achievable motor torques for the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and the minimum and maximum<br>
clutch reactive torque(s) for the applied clutch(es) (520). The minimum and<br>
maximum linear output torques are the minimum and maximum output<br>
torques that meet the motor torque constraints and also meets the applied<br>
clutch torque constraints. An operating region for the exemplary powertrain<br>
system is graphically shown, including the motor torque constraints ('Motor<br>
Torque Constraints') comprising maximum and minimum achievable motor<br>
torques ('TA_MAX', 'TA_MIN', 'TB_MAX' and 'TB_MIN') for the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 in one embodiment. Minimum and maximum<br>
clutch reactive torques for applied clutch(es) CL1 and CL2 are graphed<br>
relative to the motor torque constraints, for first and, as shown (where<br>
necessary), second applied clutches ('TCL1 MIN', 'TCL1 MAX') and (' T'CL2<br>
MIN', 'TCL2 MAX'). Minimum and maximum linear output torques ("To Min<br>
Lin', 'To Max Lin') can be determined based upon the offset motor torques,<br>
the minimum and maximum achievable motor torques for the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 and the minimum and maximum clutch reactive<br>
torques for the applied clutch(es). The minimum and maximum linear output<br>
<br>
 <br>
torques are the minimum and maximum output torques that meet the motor<br>
torque constraints and also meet the applied clutch torque constraints In the<br>
example shown, the minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques for the<br>
second applied clutch CL2 are less restrictive and outside the motor torque<br>
constraints, and thus do not constrain the output torque. Operation is bounded<br>
by the region defined by the minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques<br>
for the first applied clutch CL1 and the maximum and minimum motor torque<br>
constraints for the second electric machine 72, i.e., TB_MAX and TB_MIN. The<br>
maximum linear output torque is the maximum output torque in this region,<br>
i.e., the output torque at the intersection between the maximum motor torque<br>
constraint for the second electric machine 72 and minimum clutch reactive<br>
torque for the first applied clutch ('TCLI Min'). The minimum linear output<br>
torque is the minimum output torque in this region, i.e., the output torque at<br>
the intersection between the minimum motor torque command for the second<br>
electric machine 72 and maximum clutch reactive torque for the first applied<br>
clutch ('TCLI Max').<br>
[0064] Fig. 5B depicts operation in one of the fixed gear operating range<br>
states. During ongoing operation in one of the fixed gear operating range<br>
states, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112<br>
are monitored to determine the operator torque request. The system calculates<br>
offset torques based upon inputs including the operating range state of the<br>
transmission 10, the input torque and terms based upon system inertias, system<br>
damping, and clutch slippage ('TOMisc Opt', TCLI Misc Opt', 'TCL2 Misc<br>
Opt') described hereinbelow with reference to Eqs. 20, 21, 22, and 23 (510').<br>
The term 'CL1' designates a first applied clutch, i.e., one of clutches C1 70<br>
<br>
 <br>
and C2 62 in the embodiment described and TCL1' is the torque transferred<br>
across CL1. The term 'CL2' designates a second applied clutch, when<br>
applied, and includes one of C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 in the embodiment<br>
described and 'TCL2' is the torque transferred across CL2. The offset torques<br>
are inputs to calculate linear output torque constraints (520') and calculate an<br>
unconstrained quadratic solution to the output torque (530').<br>
[0065] The unconstrained quadratic solution to the output torque (530) is<br>
calculated using the power limits for the ESD 74, i.e., the available battery<br>
power PBAT MIN to PBAT_MAX, the offset motor torque constraints, motor torque<br>
characteristics defined in terms of coefficients for converting between<br>
mechanical torque and electric power in terms of efficiency and power loss in<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('Donut Space Coefficients')<br>
which are detailed in Eq. 11, and other scalar terms related to the torque<br>
outputs from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and the reactive<br>
torque Of the applied clutch ('KTA from To', 'KTB from To', 'KTCLI from To' 'KICL2 from<br>
To'), that are preferably determined along an optimal motor torque split line.<br>
The aforementioned inputs are used to calculate the first constraint on the<br>
output torque from the transmission 10, comprising the unconstrained<br>
quadratic solution, which includes the optimized output torque ('To*') and an<br>
optimized battery power ('P*BAT') for operating the system without concern<br>
for other constraints on the system (530), and described hereinabove with<br>
reference to Eqs. 15 and 16, and plotted with reference to Fig. 6A.<br>
[0066] The linear output torque constraints, i.e., the minimum and<br>
maximum linear output torques ('To Min Linear', 'To Max Linear') 1520') are<br>
determined based upon the offset torques, the scalar terms related to the output<br>
<br>
 <br>
torque and the reactive torque of the applied clutches ('kTo From TA", 'kTo From<br>
TB', 'kTA From TCI.l', 'kTB From TCL1', 'kTA From TCL2', 'k'TB From TCL2'), motor torque<br>
ranges comprising minimum and maximum motor torque limits of the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TAMin', TAMax', 'TBMin', 'TBMax').<br>
Minimum and maximum clutch reactive torque constraints of the applied<br>
torque transfer clutches (TCL1 Min', 'TCL1Max', 'TCL2Min', TCL2Max')<br>
comprising the specifically applied clutches for the selected operating range<br>
state, are determined. The constraints comprising the minimum and maximum<br>
linear output torques ('To Min Linear', 'To Max Linear') are determined, with<br>
the minimum linear output torque preferably comprising a maximum value of<br>
the aforementioned minimum torque values and the maximum linear output<br>
torque preferably comprising a minimum value of the aforementioned<br>
maximum torque values.<br>
[0067] In both the mode operating range state and the fixed gear operating<br>
range state, the unconstrained quadratic solution to the output torque and the<br>
maximum and minimum linear output torques are combined with a preferred<br>
output torque to calculate a preferred output torque ('To Opt') and output<br>
torque constraints ('To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw') (540). The preferred<br>
output torque is described in terms of a search range ('To Min Search', To<br>
Max Search'), which preferably comprises the operator torque request, or<br>
another allowable torque constraint. The preferred output torque can comprise<br>
an output torque which minimizes battery power consumption within the<br>
output torque range and meets the operator torque request in this embodiment.<br>
[0068]	The output torque constraints ('To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw')<br>
comprise maximum and minimum unfiltered output torques that are<br>
<br>
 <br>
determined based upon inputs including the input speed, output speed, motor<br>
torque constraints, reactive clutch torque constraints for the applied clutches,<br>
engine input torque, and input and output accelerations. The preferred output<br>
torque is subject to the output torque constraints and is determined based upon<br>
the range of allowable output torques, which can vary, and may include the<br>
immediate accelerator output torque request. The preferred output torque may<br>
comprise an output torque corresponding to a minimum battery discharge<br>
power or an output torque corresponding to a maximum battery charge power.<br>
The preferred output torque is based upon a capacity of the powertrain to<br>
transmit and convert electric power to mechanical torque through the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72, and the immediate or present torque,<br>
speed, and reactive clutch torque constraints, and electric power inputs thereto.<br>
[0069] The output torque constraints including the maximum and<br>
minimum unfiltered output torques ('To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw') and the<br>
preferred output torque ('To Opt') can be determined by executing and solving<br>
an optimization function in one of the operating range states for neutral, mode<br>
and fixed gear operation. The output torque constraints comprise a preferred<br>
output torque range at the present input torque, within the available battery<br>
power ('PBATMin/Max') and within the motor torque constraints comprising<br>
the ranges of available motor torques (TA Min/Max', 'TB Min/Max'), subject<br>
to the reactive clutch torques of the applied torque transfer clutch(es) (TCL1<br>
Min', "TCL1 Max', 'TCL2 Min', 'TCL2 Max'). Under non-braking<br>
operation, the output torque request is constrained to a maximum output<br>
torque capacity.<br>
 <br>
[0070] The inputs used to determine the maximum and minimum<br>
constraints on the output torque and the preferred output torque include power<br>
output capacity of the ESD 74, including the available battery power and any<br>
DC load on the ESD 74, the motor torque characteristics defined in terms of<br>
coefficients for converting between mechanical torque and electric power in<br>
terms of efficiency and power loss in the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 ('Donut Space Coefficients'). Furthermore the present operating range<br>
state of the transmission ('Hybrid Range State'), the input torque, the input<br>
speed ('NI), output speed ('No'), clutch speed ('NC'), acceleration of slipping<br>
clutches ('Ncsdot'), acceleration of the output member 64 ('Nodot'), and<br>
acceleration of the input member 12 ('Nidot') and maximum and minimum<br>
reactive clutch torques for the applied clutch(es) ('TCL1 Min', TCL1 Max',<br>
TCL2 Min', TCL2 Max') and estimated torques of the non-applied, slipping<br>
clutches ('Tcs') are monitored. The aforementioned accelerations are<br>
preferably based upon acceleration profiles with targeted acceleration rates,<br>
but can be actual accelerations. The ranges of available motor torques for the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are also monitored and used as<br>
described hereinabove.<br>
[0071] The optimization function preferably comprises a linear equation<br>
that is implemented in an executable algorithm and solved during ongoing<br>
operation of the system to determine the preferred output torque range to<br>
minimize battery power consumption and meet the operator torque request.<br>
The linear equation takes into account the input torque ('Ti'), system inertias<br>
and linear damping. Preferably, there is a linear equation for each of the<br>
operating range states for mode operation.<br>
<br>
 <br>
[0072] When the transmission 14 is in one of the mode operating range<br>
states the linear equation for the system is Eq. 17:<br>
 <br>
[0073] Eq. 17 can be solved to determine a preferred output torque which<br>
minimizes the battery power and meets the operator torque request. The<br>
TCL1 term represents reactive torque transfer across the applied clutch for the<br>
mode operation, i.e., clutch C1 62 in Mode 1 and clutch C2 70 in Mode 2.<br>
The terms Tcs1, Tcs2, Tcs3 represent torque transfer across the non-applied,<br>
slipping clutches for the specific mode operation.<br>

due to the input torque TI. The scalar terms are based upon the torque outputs<br>
from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and the reactive torque<br>
of the applied clutch related to the input torque ('kTA from TI' 'kTB from TI', "kTCL1<br>
from Ti') determined for the specific system application.<br>

[0078] Eq. 17 can be rewritten as Eq. 18:<br>
 <br>
with the offset motor torques based upon inputs including the operating range<br>
state of the transmission 10, the input torque and terms based upon system<br>
inertias, system damping, and clutch slippage (TA Misc', 'TB Misc'. TCL1<br>
Misc') combined into a single vector.<br>
[0079] For an input torque TI, Eq. 18 reduces to Eq. 19 as follows.<br>
 <br>
[0080] Eq. 19 can be solved using the preferred output torque ('To Opt')<br>
to determine preferred motor torques from the first and second electric<br>
 <br>
machines 56 and 72 (TA Opt', 'TB Opt') (550). Preferred battery powers<br>
('PBATOpt', TAOpt', 'PBOpt') can be calculated based thereon (560)<br>
[0081] When the transmission 14 is in one of the fixed gear operating<br>
range states the linear equation for the system is Eq. 20.<br>
 <br>
[0082] Eq. 20 can be solved to determine a preferred output torque which<br>
minimizes the battery power and meets the operator torque request. The TCL1<br>
and TCL2 terms represent reactive torque transfer across the applied clutches<br>
for the fixed gear operation. The terms Tcs1 and Tcs2 represent torque<br>
transfer across the non-applied, slipping clutches for the specific fixed gear<br>
operation.<br>

powertrain system. The bl 1 -b31 terms are system-specific scalar values<br>

and the reactive torque transfer across the applied clutches TCLI and TCL2 due<br>
to linear damping, having a single degree of freedom, selected as a linearly<br>

terms represent clutch torques across the non-applied, slipping torque transfer<br>
clutches. The c11 -c32 terms are system-specific scalar values determined for<br>
the specific system application.<br>
[0088] Eq. 20 can be rewritten as Eq. 21:<br>
 <br>
[0089] For an input torque TI, Eq. 21 can be rewritten as Eq. 22;<br>
 <br>
with the output torque and the reactive torque transfer across the applied<br>
clutches TCL1 and TCL2 based upon the motor torques with the operating range<br>
state of the transmission 10, and terms based upon input torque, system<br>
inertias, system damping, and clutch slippage (To Offset', TCL1 Offset*,<br>
TCL2_Offset') combined into a single vector. Eq. 22 can be solved using the<br>
preferred output torque (To Opt') determined in Eq. 20 to determine preferred<br>
 <br>
motor torques from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, including<br>
determining preferred motor torque split ('TA Opt', TB Opt') (550').<br>
[0090] The motor torque commands can be used to control the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 to transfer output torque to the output<br>
member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque at<br>
wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in response to the operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. Preferably, propelling the vehicle results in vehicle<br>
acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient to overcome external<br>
loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade, aerodynamic loads, and other<br>
loads.<br>
[0091] Fig. 7 shows a process (700) for determining a preferred output<br>
torque (To Opt') including preferred motor torques for controlling the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TA Opt', 'TB Opt') and a preferred<br>
battery power (TBAT-Opt) based thereon. This includes determining the<br>
minimum and maximum linear output torques (To Min Linear', To Max<br>
Linear') (710), and thus determining minimum and maximum output torques<br>
(To Min') (720) and (To Max') (730). A search is executed to determine a<br>
minimum output torque, and the preferred output torque can be calculated (To<br>
Opt') (740). This includes selecting a temporary output torque comprising a<br>
minimum value of the minimum of the search range for the output torque (To<br>
Min Search') and the maximum output torque (To Max'). The preferred<br>
output torque is selected as the maximum of the temporary output torque, the<br>
minimum output torque, and the minimum linear output torque. Preferred<br>
motor torques and battery powers (Ta Opt', Tb Opt', and 'PBAT Opt') can be<br>
 <br>
determined based upon the preferred output torque (750), and used to control<br>
operation of the powertrain system.<br>
[0092] Fig. 8 shows a flowchart 720 for determining the minimum output<br>
torque ('To Min'). Figs. 10 and 11 show results illustrative of the concept,<br>
when operating in a fixed gear operating range state. The preferred output<br>
torque at maximum charging battery power (To@PBATMin Pos Root') can be<br>
determined ('DOPT'), as described herein with reference to Fig. 6 and Eqs. 15<br>
and 16 (802). The preferred output torque at maximum charging battery<br>
power is compared to the minimum linear output torque ('To Min Lin') (804).<br>
When the minimum linear output torque is greater than or equal to the<br>
preferred output torque at maximum charging battery power, the output torque<br>
is set equal to the minimum linear output torque (806). This is the preferred<br>
output torque returned to the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque<br>
To Min.<br>
[0093] When the minimum linear output torque is less than the preferred<br>
output torque at minimum charging battery power, clutch torques for the<br>
applied clutches are determined for operating the powertrain system at the<br>
preferred output torque at maximum charging battery power (808). For<br>
purposes of the figures, the applied clutches are referred to as 'CL1.' and<br>
'CL2', wherein the applied clutches are specific to the selected transmission<br>
operating range state. When the transmission 10 is operating in one of the<br>
mode operating range states, i.e., M1 and M2 in this embodiment, torques and<br>
forces related to clutch CL2 are ignored. When the clutch torques for the first<br>
and second applied clutches CL1 and CL2 are between respective minimum<br>
and maximum clutch reactive torques and thus achievable (810), the output<br>
<br>
 <br>
torque is set equal to the preferred output torque at the maximum charging<br>
battery power (812).<br>
[0094] When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 is within<br>
respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques and thus<br>
achievable (814), the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
compared to a maximum achievable clutch torque (816), and when greater, the<br>
preferred output torque ('To Min') is determined to be a maximum charging<br>
battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a point ('DCL2MAX') at which the output<br>
torque meets the maximum achievable clutch torque for the second applied<br>
clutch CL2 ('TCL2MAX') and is within the battery power constraints and the<br>
motor torque constraints (818). This is the preferred output torque returned to<br>
the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To Min (819).<br>
[0095] When the second applied clutch CL2 is less than the maximum<br>
achievable clutch torque (816), i.e., less than TCL1Min, the preferred output<br>
torque ('To Min') is determined to be a maximum charging battery power<br>
('To@PBATMin') at a point ('DCL2MIN') at which the output torque meets the<br>
minimum achievable clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2<br>
('TCL2MIN') and is within the battery power constraints and the motor torque<br>
constraints (820). This is the preferred output torque returned to the process<br>
700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To Min (821).<br>
[0096] When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 is not<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques (814), it is<br>
determined whether the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques and is thus<br>
achievable (822). When the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
<br>
 <br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques, a slope of<br>
the output torque line ('To') is compared to the slope of the clutch torque for<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 (824). When the output torque line ('To') is<br>
parallel to the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1') the<br>
minimum output torque ('To Min') is determined to be the minimum linear<br>
output torque ('To Min Lin') (826). This is the preferred output torque<br>
returned to the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To Min.<br>
[0097] When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1') is<br>
greater than the maximum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CL1<br>
('TCL1MAX') (828, 830), the preferred output torque ('To Min') is determined<br>
to be the maximum charging battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a point<br>
('DCL1MAX') at which the output torque which meets the maximum achievable<br>
clutch torque for CL1 ('TCL1MAX') and is within the battery power<br>
constraints and the motor torque constraints (830). This is the preferred output<br>
torque returned to the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To<br>
Min (831).<br>
[0098] When the output torque line ('To') is not parallel to the clutch<br>
torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1'), and when the clutch torque for<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1') is less than the minimum clutch torque of<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1MAX') (828, 834), i.e., less than TCL1Min,<br>
the preferred output torque ('To Min') is determined to be the maximum<br>
charging battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a point ('DCLIMIN') at which the<br>
output torque which meets the minimum achievable clutch torque for CL1<br>
('TCLIMIN') and is within the battery power constraints and the motor torque<br>
 <br>
constraints (834). This is the preferred output torque returned to the process<br>
700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To Min (835).<br>
[0099] When the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
outside the respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques, a<br>
clutch torque limit ('TCL1Limit') for the first applied clutch CL1 is set to a<br>
minimum of the maximum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CL1<br>
(TCL1MAX') and a maximum of the first clutch torque ('TCL1') and a<br>
minimum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1MIN'). A clutch<br>
torque limit ('TCL2Limit')for the second applied clutch CL2 is set to a<br>
minimum of the maximum clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2<br>
('TCL1MAX') and a maximum of the second clutch torque ('TCL2') and a<br>
minimum clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2 ('ToCL2MEM') (836).<br>
[00100]	Subsequently, a slope of the output torque line ('To') is<br>
compared to the slope of the clutch torque line for the first applied clutch CL1<br>
(838). When the output torque line ('To') is parallel to the clutch torque for<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1'), the output torque ('Return To') at the<br>
maximum charging battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a point that is within<br>
the battery power constraints and the motor torque constraints and meeting<br>
limits of the clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2 ('TCL1Limit') is<br>
determined (840). The minimum output torque ('To min') is determined to be<br>
the maximum of the maximum linear output torque ('To Max Lin') and the<br>
return output torque ('Return To') (841). This is the preferred output torque<br>
returned to the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To Min<br>
[00101]	When the output torque line ('To') is not parallel to the clutch<br>
torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1'), a first output torque is<br>
<br>
 <br>
determined at the maximum charging battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a<br>
point that is within the battery power constraints and the motor torque<br>
constraints and that meets limits of the clutch torque of the first applied clutch<br>
CL1 ('TCL1Limit'). A second output torque is determined at the maximum<br>
charging battery power ('To@PBATMin') at a point that is within the battery<br>
power constraints and the motor torque constraints and that meets limits of the<br>
clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2 ('TCL2Limit') (842). The<br>
preferred output torque is a maximum of the first and second output torque,<br>
which is returned to the process 700 at 720 as the minimum output torque To<br>
Min (844).<br>
[00102]	Fig. 9 shows a flowchart 730 for determining the maximum<br>
output torque ('To Min'). Figs. 10 and 11 show results illustrative of the<br>
concept. The preferred output torque at maximum discharging battery power<br>
('To@PBATMax Opt'), which comprises 'To@PBATMax Pos Root' of Fig. 6,<br>
can be determined ('COPT') as described herein with reference to Fig. 6 and<br>
Eqs. 15 and 16 (902). The preferred output torque at maximum discharging<br>
battery power is compared to the maximum linear output torque ('To Max<br>
Lin') (904). When the preferred output torque at the maximum discharging<br>
battery power is greater than the maximum linear output torque, the output<br>
torque ('COPT') is set equal to the maximum linear output torque (906). This is<br>
the preferred output torque returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum<br>
output torque To Max.<br>
[00103]	When the preferred output torque at maximum discharging<br>
battery power is less than or equal to the maximum linear output torque, clutch<br>
torques for the applied clutches are determined for operating the powertrain<br>
<br>
 <br>
system at the preferred output torque at maximum discharging battery power<br>
(908). For purposes of this figure, the applied clutches are referred to as<br>
'CL1,' and 'CL2', wherein the applied clutches are specific to the selected<br>
transmission operating range state. When the transmission 10 is operating in<br>
one of the mode operating range states, i.e., Mil and M2 in this embodiment,<br>
torques and forces related to clutch CL2 are ignored. When the clutch torques<br>
for the first and second applied clutches CL1 and CL2 are between respective<br>
minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques and thus achievable (910), the<br>
output torque is set equal to the preferred output torque at the maximum<br>
discharging battery power (912).<br>
[00104]	When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 is<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques and thus<br>
achievable (914), the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
compared to a maximum achievable clutch torque (916), and when greater, the<br>
preferred output torque ('To Max') is determined to be a maximum<br>
discharging battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a point ('CCL2MAX') at which<br>
the output torque meets the maximum achievable clutch torque for the second<br>
applied clutch CL2 ('TCL2MAX') and is within the battery power constraints<br>
and the motor torque constraints (918). This is the preferred output torque<br>
returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum output torque To Max<br>
(919).<br>
[00105]	When the second applied clutch CL2 is less than the maximum<br>
achievable clutch torque (916), the preferred output torque ('To Max') is<br>
determined to be a maximum discharging battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a<br>
point ('CCL2MIN') at which the output torque meets the minimum achievable<br>
<br>
 <br>
clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 ('TCL2MIN') and is within the<br>
battery power constraints and the motor torque constraints (920). This is the<br>
preferred output torque returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum<br>
output torque To Max (921).<br>
[00106]	When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 is not<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques (914), it is<br>
determined whether the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques and is thus<br>
achievable (922). When the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
within respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques, a slope of<br>
the output torque line ('To') is compared to the slope of the clutch torque for<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 (924). When the output torque line ('To') is<br>
parallel to the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CL1 (TCL1'), the<br>
preferred output torque ('To Max') is determined to be the maximum linear<br>
output torque ('To Max Lin') (926). This is the preferred output torque<br>
returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum output torque To Max.<br>
[00107]	When the output torque line ('To') is not parallel to the clutch<br>
torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCLI'), when the clutch torque for the<br>
first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1') is greater than the maximum clutch torque of<br>
the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1MAX') (928, 930), the preferred output<br>
torque ('To Max') is determined to be the maximum discharging battery<br>
power ('To@PBATMax') at a point ('CCL1MAX') at which the output torque<br>
which meets the maximum achievable clutch torque for CL1 ('TCL1MAX')<br>
and is within the battery power constraints and the motor torque constraints<br>
 <br>
(930). This is the preferred output torque returned to the process 700 at 720 as<br>
the maximum output torque To Max (931).<br>
[00108]	When the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CLl ('TCL1')<br>
is less than the maximum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CLl<br>
('TCL1MAX') (928, 934), the preferred output torque ('To Max') is determined<br>
to be the maximum discharging battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a point<br>
('CCLIMIN') at which the output torque which meets the minimum achievable<br>
clutch torque for CLl ('TCL1MIN') and is within the battery power constraints<br>
and the motor torque constraints (934). This is the preferred output torque<br>
returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum output torque To Max<br>
(935).<br>
[00109]	When the clutch torque for the second applied clutch CL2 is<br>
outside the respective minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques, a<br>
clutch torque limit ('TCLI Limit') for the first applied clutch CLl is set to a<br>
minimum of the maximum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CLl<br>
('TCLIMAX') and a maximum of the first clutch torque ('TCLI') and a<br>
minimum clutch torque of the first applied clutch CLl ('TCLIMIN'). A clutch<br>
torque limit ('TCL2 Limit') for the second applied clutch CL2 is set to a<br>
minimum of the maximum clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2<br>
('TCL2MAX') and a maximum of the second clutch torque ('TCL2') and a<br>
minimum clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2 ('TCL1MIN') (932).<br>
Subsequently, a slope of the output torque line ('To') is compared to the slope<br>
of the clutch torque for the first applied clutch CLl (938). When the output<br>
torque line ('To') is parallel to the clutch torque for the first applied clutch<br>
CLl ('TCL1'), the output torque ('Return To') at the maximum discharging<br>
<br>
 <br>
battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a point that is within the battery power<br>
constraints and the motor torque constraints and meeting limits of the dutch<br>
torque of the second applied clutch CL2 (TCL1Limit') is determined (940).<br>
The maximum output torque ('To Max') is determined to be the minimum of<br>
the maximum linear output torque ('To Max Lin') and the return output torque<br>
('Return To') (941) This is the preferred output torque returned to the process<br>
700 at 720 as the maximum output torque To Max.<br>
[00110]	When the output torque line ('To') is not parallel to the clutch<br>
torque for the first applied clutch CL1 ('TCL1'), a first output torque is<br>
determined at the maximum discharging battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a<br>
point that is within the battery power constraints and the motor torque<br>
constraints and that meets limits of the clutch torque of the first applied clutch<br>
CL1 (TCL1Limit'). A second output torque is determined at the maximum<br>
discharging battery power ('To@PBATMax') at a point that is within the<br>
battery power constraints and the motor torque constraints and that meets<br>
limits of the clutch torque of the second applied clutch CL2 ('TCL2 Limit")<br>
(942). The preferred output torque is a minimum of the first and second<br>
output torques, which is returned to the process 700 at 720 as the maximum<br>
output torque To Max (944).<br>
[00111]	Figs. 10, 11, and 12 graphically show operation of the control<br>
scheme to control the powertrain system described with reference to Figs. 1, 2,<br>
and 3, utilizing the graphical mathematical constructs described with reference<br>
to Figs. 4 and 6. The first coordinate system L depicts TA/TB space, and is<br>
based upon motor torques TA and TB. The second coordinate system K depicts<br>
motor torques TA and TB transformed to the TX/TY space, described with<br>
<br>
 <br>
reference to Fig. 4 and Eqs. 1-12, and is plotted in relationship to the first<br>
coordinate system L and the TA/TB space. The third coordinate system M<br>
depicts PBAT/TO space, and is based upon battery power PBAT in relation to<br>
output torque To, described with reference to Fig. 6 and Eqs. 1-12 In the<br>
illustrative operation shown, the transmission 10 is operating in G2 with CL1<br>
= C1 70 and CL2 = C2 62.<br>
[00112]	The independently determined parameters include PBAT Min<br>
and PBAT Max, plotted as RMIN and RMAX in TX/TY space relative to the second<br>
coordinate system K. A net zero battery power line RO is also shown. The<br>
transformed motor torque constraints ('Motor torque constraints') can be<br>
determined and plotted in the TX/TY space, or in the TA/TB space. The First<br>
coordinate system L shows the TA/TB space with TA = 0 and TB =0, which can<br>
be determined in the Tx/TY space and plotted relative to the K coordinate<br>
system. The two points TA = 0, TB = 0 and Tx = 0, Ty = 0 define the preferred<br>
motor torque split line ('Optimal Motor Torque Split Line'), which comprises<br>
a torque split between the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 that<br>
achieves minimum power losses and can be determined based upon the motor<br>
torque constraints and minimizes battery power for an output torque. Clutch<br>
reactive torque ranges comprising minimum, maximum, and zero clutch<br>
torques for the first clutch ('TCLIMIN', 'TCLIMAX', 'TCLI= 0') and for the<br>
second clutch ('TCL1MIN', 'TCL2MAX', 'TCL2= 0') can be determined relative<br>
to the motor torque constraints and battery power constraints and plotted in the<br>
Tx/Ty space relative to the second coordinate system K or the TA/TB space<br>
relative to the first coordinate system L. The battery powers PBAT Min and<br>
PBAT Max are plotted relative to the third coordinate system M which shows<br>
<br>
 <br>
PBAT in relationship to output torque TO. The third coordinate system M shows<br>
PBAT in relationship to output torque To, from zero output torque CTO = 0')<br>
with increasing output torque, including lines representing the minimum and<br>
maximum linear output torques ('T0 Min Lin', T0 Max Lin'). The maximum<br>
and minimum output torques are plotted in the third coordinate system<br>
(TO@PBATMAX Opt' and 'To@PBATMAX Opt'), and are shown for the<br>
positive root case, the derivation of which is described with reference to Fig.<br>
6. The maximum and minimum output torques translate to the Tx/TY space, as<br>
shown.<br>
[00113]	Thus, in operation the hybrid transmission 14 transfers torque<br>
between the input member 12 and the torque machines, e.g., the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72, and the output member 64 in one of the<br>
fixed gear and continuously variable operating range states through selective<br>
application of the torque transfer clutches, e.g., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75. The clutch reactive torque ranges are determined for the applied<br>
clutches, and the motor torque ranges are determined for the torque machines.<br>
The electric power transferred from the ESD 74 is determined. Constraints on<br>
the output torque transferred to the output member 64 are determined based<br>
upon the clutch reactive torque ranges of the applied clutches. Constraints on<br>
the output torque transferred to the output member 64 are determined based<br>
upon the motor torque ranges of the torque machines. Constraints on the<br>
output torque transferred to the output member 64 are determined based upon<br>
the power transferred from the energy storage device. An allowable output<br>
torque range to the output member 64 is determined that is achievable within<br>
the constraints on the output torque transferred to the output member based<br>
<br>
 <br>
upon the clutch reactive torque ranges of the applied clutches, the motor<br>
torque ranges of the torque machines, and the power transferred from the<br>
energy storage device. The hybrid transmission can be controlled to generate<br>
an output torque from the transmission 10 that is based upon the allowable<br>
output torque range and the constraints. This can include inducing a constraint<br>
on the clutch reactive torque range of one of the applied clutches, e.g.. to<br>
offload torque transfer by the clutch in order to permit deactivation of the<br>
clutch without slipping. The constraints on the output torque transferred to the<br>
output member can be determined, as described herein, based upon the<br>
induced constraint on the clutch reactive torque range of one of the applied<br>
clutches. An allowable output torque range can be determined that is<br>
achievable within the constraints on the output torque transferred to the output<br>
member based upon the clutch reactive torque ranges of the applied clutches,<br>
if any, and the other constraints including the motor torque ranges of the<br>
torque machines, the power transferred from the energy storage device, and<br>
the induced constraint on the clutch reactive torque range of one of the applied<br>
clutches. Operation of the powertrain system to determine constraints on the<br>
output torque are depicted.<br>
[00114]	Fig. 10 depicts operation in one of the fixed gears, i.e., G2, for<br>
the embodiment described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2, when operation is<br>
not constrained by the clutch torque constraints for the first and second<br>
clutches CL1 and CL2. When the preferred output torque at maximum<br>
charging battery power ('TO@PBATMIN Opt') is greater than the minimum<br>
linear output torque ('TOMIN Lin'), then the preferred output torque ('DOPT')<br>
is the maximum charging battery power ('TO@PBAT MIN Opt') so long as the<br>
<br>
 <br>
preferred output torque does not violate clutch torque constraints. When the<br>
preferred output torque at maximum discharging battery power (TO@PBAT<br>
MAX Opt') is less than the maximum linear output torque ('TOMax Lin'),<br>
then the preferred output torque ('COPT') is the maximum discharging battery<br>
power ('TO@PBATMAX Opt') so long as the preferred output torque does not<br>
violate clutch torque constraints.<br>
[00115]	Fig. 11 depicts operation in one of the fixed gears, i.e., G2 for<br>
the embodiment described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2, and during a<br>
transition to Mode 2 operation, wherein one of the clutches CL1 is off-loaded.<br>
In this scenario, the clutch torques for CL1 can affect operation. The preferred<br>
output torque at maximum discharging battery power ('TO@PBATMAX Opt')<br>
is less than the maximum linear output torque ('ToMAX Lin'), but the first<br>
clutch torque TCL1 at the preferred output torque ('COPT') comprising the<br>
maximum discharging battery power ('TO@PBAT MAX Opt') is less than the<br>
minimum clutch torque constraints for the first clutch ('TCLIMIN'). In this<br>
instance, the preferred maximum output torque ('CCLIMIN') comprises the<br>
output torque that satisfies the battery power constraints ('PBATMAX') and<br>
meets the minimum clutch torque constraint for the first clutch ('TCL1MIN').<br>
The preferred output torque ('CCL1MIN') does not intersect the preferred motor<br>
torque split line ('Optimal Motor Torque Split Line'), and the motor torque<br>
split between the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., TA and TB,<br>
can not achieve minimum power losses during operation with the clutch<br>
constraints. The motor torque split can be determined based upon the CL1<br>
torque constraints.<br>
 <br>
[00116]	The preferred output torque at maximum charging battery<br>
power ('TO@PBAT MIN Opt') is greater than the minimum linear output torque<br>
(TOMIN Lin'), and the preferred output torque ('DOPT') comprising the<br>
maximum discharging battery power (To@PBAT MAX Opt') is within clutch<br>
torque constraints for the first clutch ('TCLIMIN'). In this instance, the<br>
preferred minimum output torque ('DCLIMIN') comprises the output torque that<br>
satisfies the battery power constraints ('PBAT MIN') and meets the maximum<br>
charging battery power (TO@PBATMIN Opt').<br>
[00117]	Fig. 12 depicts operation in one of the fixed gears, i.e., G2 for<br>
the embodiment described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2, and during a<br>
transition to Mode 1 operation, wherein a second one of the clutches CL2 is<br>
off-loaded. In this scenario, the clutch reactive torques for CL2 can affect<br>
operation. The preferred output torque at maximum charging battery power<br>
('TO@PBATMIN Opt') is less than the minimum linear output torque ('To Min<br>
Lin'), and the preferred output torque ('D OPT') comprising the maximum<br>
charging battery power ('TO@PBAT MIN Opt') exceeds the maximum clutch<br>
torque constraint for the second clutch ('TCL2MAX'). In this instance, the<br>
preferred minimum output torque (To Min Lin') consists of the minimum<br>
linear output torque. The preferred minimum output torque does not intersect<br>
the preferred motor torque split line ('Optimal Motor Torque Split Line'), and<br>
thus the motor torque split between the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72, i.e., TA and TB, can not achieve minimum power losses during<br>
operation with the clutch constraints. The motor torque split can be<br>
determined based upon the CL2 torque constraints.<br>
