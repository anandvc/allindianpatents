The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: <br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to novel substituted aryl ketones, to a process for  meir<br>
5	preparation and to their use as crop treatment agents, in particular herbicides.<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way<br>
10	restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths and areas with and without tree plantings. Similarly, the active<br>
15	compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in<br>
perennial crops, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in<br>
20	annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
activity and a broad active spectrum when used on the soil and on above-ground<br>
parts of plants. To a certain extent they are also suitable for the selective control of<br>
25	monocotyledonous    and    dicotyledonous    weeds    in    monocotyledonous    and<br>
dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial<br>
30	plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for<br>
the synthesis of other active compounds.<br><br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally<br>
5	occurring crop plants).  Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by<br>
conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and inclusive of the cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants<br>
10	above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which<br>
may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
15<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants<br>
20	and cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with<br>
conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
25	Particularly preferably, plants of the cultivars which are in each case commercially<br>
available or in use are treated according to the invention. Cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
30<br><br>
Depending on the plant species or cultivars, their location and growth conditions<br>
(soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may<br>
also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced<br>
application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the<br>
5	activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the<br>
invention also in combination with other agrochemically active compounds, better<br>
plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to<br>
drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier<br>
harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a<br>
10	higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better 'storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which<br>
15	are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the<br>
genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
20	easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or<br>
25	viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active<br>
compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton<br>
30	and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the<br>
plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br><br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes<br>
CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb<br>
and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants").<br>
Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of plants to<br>
5	fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic  acquired resistance (SAR),  systemin,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example the<br>
10	"PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits m question can also be<br>
present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for  example  maize,   cotton,   soya  beans),   KnockOut®   (for  example  maize),<br>
15	StarLink®   (for  example   maize),   Bollgard®   (cotton),   Nucotn®   (cotton)   and<br>
NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinothricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
20	IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for<br>
example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which<br>
25	plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
30	example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and,<br><br>
in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as<br>
5	solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
10	active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br>
optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents<br>
15	as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics<br>
such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene<br>
chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br>
mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol<br>
20	and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl<br>

The aqueous<br>
15	phase of the filtrate is separated off, acidified with 2N hydrochloric acid and<br>
extracted with methylene chloride. The organic extract is washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is purified by preparative HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography).<br>

stirred at room temperature for another 18 hours. For work-up, the solvent is removed from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator and the residue is partitioned between water and dichloromethane. The organic phase is separated off, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is<br>
