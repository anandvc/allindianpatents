BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for racemizing an optically active vinyl-substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid compound.<br>
Optically active vinyl-substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid compounds are known as important synthetic pyrethroid insecticides or production intermediates thereof, and a desired optical isomer thereof has been produced by optical resolution of a racemate thereof with an optical resolution agent. In connection with the optical resolution process, the other isomer o"f the resolved desired compound was racemized to the racemate for the purpose of efficiently utilizing the produced chemicals, and there have been reported, for example, a racemization method of an optically active chrysanthemum-monocarboxylic acid by reacting the optically active acid or its halide with a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminum bromide), and a method of irradiating light in the co-presence of thiol(SH), and the like (JP-A-52-144651, JP-A-60-174744, JP-A-61-5045, JP-A-1-261349).<br>

required.<br>

This reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC using an optically active column and gas chromatography, which demonstrated that ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylate containing: 48.3% (+)-trans isomer; 41.7% (-)-trans isomer; 5.0% (+)-cis isomer; and 5.1% (-)-cis isomer was obtained in a yield of 90%.<br>
Example 14<br>
To a 15 ml tubular reaction vessel equipped with a condenser were charged 1.68 g of optically active 2,2-<br><br>
dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid containing: 74.4% (+)-trans isomer[(1R, 3R)-isomer]; 3.0% (-)-trans isomer[(IS, 3S)-isomer]; 23.1% (+)-cis isomer[(1R, 3S)-isomer]; and 0.5% (-)-cis isomer[(lS, 3R)-isomer], 0.019 g of nitric acid having<br>
a concentration of 65%, and 0.0038g of A1(N03)3* 9H20, and 6 ml of toluene, and the resulting mixture was stirred under reflux of toluene for 4 hours.  This reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC using an optically active column and gas chromatography, which demonstrated that 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid containing: 52.6% ( + )-trans isomer; 38.1% (-)-trans isomer; 4.7% (+)-cis isomer; and 4,6% (-)-cis isomer was obtained in a yield of 98%.<br><br><br><br>
