				<td>A process for the preparation of phytomedicinal composition to increase secretion of mammary glands for lactating mothers.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition of herbal biscuits for lactating mothers acting as dietary supplement and the process for the preparation thereof. The composition of the present invention has nutritive digestive, stimulant and appetite improving properties attributed to a polyherbal composition of many natural herbs along with nutritive flours which not only compensate the essential dietary requirements of lactating mothers, but also act as a preventive and rejuvenate health supplement which relieves stress and fatigue in daily life.<br>
Background and Prior Art References<br>
The term dietary supplement was formally defined by U.S. Government office in 1994 as a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet to enhance health that bears or contains one or more of the dietary ingredients viz.: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals or a dietary substance for use to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, and is intended for ingestion in the form of capsule, powder, soft gel, gel capsule and not represented as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. [Dietary supplement Health and Education Act DSHEA Public Law 103-417, 25 October 1994; codified at 42 use 287C-11].<br>
Mental makeup of the people depend considerably on the food articles which they consume and it is very well illustrated by a set of verses in the Hindu's famous religious book Bhagwat Gita XVIII 8-10. The lactating mothers require a very nutritive diet to keep them fit after the delivery. At the height of lactation 1.5 litres of milk may be formed each day. With this degree of lactation, great quantities of metabolic substrates are drained. 50 g of fat enters the milk each day, approximately 100 g of lactose derived from glucose is lost, 2-3 gm. calcium phosphate producing decalcification of bone specific problem during lactation. [A.C. Guyton: Textbook of Medical Physiology W.B. Saunders Company West Washington Square Philadelphia PA 19105 PP. 996 1986]. General dietary habits are not sufficient to fulfil the requirement of all nutrients of the body. The secretion<br><br>
Guyton: Textbook of Medical Physiology W.B. Saunders Company West Washington Square Philadelphia PA 19105 PP. 996 1986]. General dietary habits are not sufficient te-felfil"the-   of milk requires energy and the body has three folds demand for calories during lactation. There is need of sufficient fuel to permit the women to carryout the ordinary day to day activities. Activity of the mammary glands and energy content of milk secreted are the two important requirements. The inefficiency of some women in converting food into milk has been found to be crucial at the time of specific function of lactation. Loss of weight during lactation is fairly common, with women with malnutrition.<br>
To maintain harmonious balance between the different aspects of life, the quality of food improved considerably in terms of its food value and taste with the advancement of civilisation. Preventive measures are probably the most effective method of dealing with these conditions and such measures should include diet and dietary supplements. Many neutraceutical compositions, health foods, drinks and supplements are available in the market but only few compositions/products are available in form of neutraceutical biscuits especially for lactating mothers.<br>
Theraptein manufactured &amp; marketed by Raptakos, Brett and Co.Ltd. MIDC DHA TV Roha 40211160, Velacheri Road, Chennai, India contains following ingredients for 5 gm (approximate). Protein (mainly casein) 1.5 gm, Carbohydrate 2.4 gm, Fat 0.7 gm, Thiamine hydrochloride 0.25 mg, Riboflavin 0.25 mg, Nicotinamide 0.25 mg, 22 calories per biscuit intact protein. It claims to supply vital protein of high biological value. It is useful for those who due to illness or faulty dietary habit, do not take sufficient amount of protein and make up quantitatively and qualitatively the protein exhaustion, common to house wives, school going children and business and professional men.<br>
Second brand name GRD Bix biscuits manufactured and marketed by Cadila Health Care Ltd<br><br>
16, Azad Society Ambawadi, Ahmedabad 380015 contains following ingredients per 5 gm approximate Protein (mainly casein) 1.4 gm, Fat 0.7 gm, Carbohydrate 2 gm, Calcium 40 mg, Phosphorus 38 mg, Iron 100 mg, Vitamin A 266 I.D., Vitamin D 17 I.U., Nicotinamide 2.5 mg, Vitamin B2 225 mg, Vitamin Bl 165 mg, Vitamin B6 50 mg, Folic acid 0.8 mg, Vitamin B12 0.8 mg, Copper 20 mg, Manganese 1.2 mg, Zinc 75 mg. It is recommended as a nutritional supplement for under weight, general ill health for aged, growing children, teenagers, athletes, traveller, businessmen, pregnant women and lactating mothers.<br>
These biscuits have been enriched adding nutritional ingredients from synthetic sources. However nothing has been supplemented to increase the secretion of mammary gland for those women who are not very much efficient of converting food into milk. These drawbacks have been over come in the present composition of sweet biscuits made up of mixtures of natural ingredients<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a composition of herbal biscuits for lactating mothers, which acts as dietary supplement and process for the preparation thereof.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a composition, which activates and regulates the secretion of mammary glands to increase lactation.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a composition which improves the digestion and appetite of the lactating mothers by regulating the metabolic activities.<br>

The process of preparation of herbal biscuits comprises following steps<br>
1.	preparation of phytomedicinal composition of therapeutical herbs.<br>
2.	preparation of nutritive flours.<br><br>
3.	addition of sugar and medicinal spices.<br>
4.	preparation of flavoured paste and baking.<br>
Identified and cleaned plant materials were grinded and sieved separately. They were mixed in quantities indicated as above from group A, B &amp; C plants respectively. The mixture was homogenised in mixture grinder along with 1 gm each of ground medicinal spices of group D except Curcuma longa.<br>
Nutritive flour was prepared by mixing the flours of wheat, Soya, Buck wheat and Bengal gram along with powdered leaves of Moringa olifera and kernal of Kamal gatta (seeds after removing seed coats) in the quantities specified above.<br>
0.5 gm of Curcuma longa powder is fried with 0.5 gm of Ghee (purified butter) in fry pan and nutritive flour prepared earlier was added along with 1.5 gm ghee and mixture was fried till light pink colour, and then cooled at room temperature and sugar powder (18 gm) was added along with the preparation made in the earlier step one.<br>
To the above preparation sufficient quantity of fresh carrot juice (30-40 ml dry wt. 2.5 gm) was added and a uniform paste was made and spread in a 0.2-0.3 cm thick layer. Small disketts were cut with the help of a mould. Lastly cardamom seeds and Poppy seeds were sprinkled on all disketts. The disketts were baked in an electric oven for 15 minutes.<br>
The prepared biscuits were tasty and widely accepted by the lactating mothers, no adverse or side effects were reported by the ladies after 30 days continuous use two times daily having 2 diskettes at a time. In a sample field trial the biscuits were used by ten lactating mothers engaged in physical labour for 30 days reported enhancement in secretion of mammary glands and improvement in physical stress after the daily physical labour.<br>
Advantages<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br><br>
The present composition contains phytomedicinal combination having galactogogue (lactogenic) properties, which increase the secretion of mammary glands.<br>
Four groups of therapeutically active plants having galactogogue, adaptogenic/imunomodulating, hepatoprotective, digestive and appetite improving properties have been incorporated which improve the physiological and metabolic activities and rejuvenate the body system to relieve the fatigue and stress condition of the body.<br>
Leaves ofMoringa olifera are added for preparation of nutritive flour, which increases the input of calcium, vitamin A contents and many other vital minerals needed for lactating mothers.<br>
There are certain medicinal spices like Piper nigrum, Piper longiim which act as bio-enhancers and also produce good taste to the composition besides their therapeutic properties.<br>
Curcuma longa having versatile medicinal properties also act as natural preservative due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.<br>
The present composition has nutritive and tonic properties along with curative and preventive actions, which regulate the body functions for long time.<br>
The flours utilised in the composition are not only the source of carbohydrate, protein and fat but they are also rich in essential nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamins, iodine, amino acids which are very important for lactating mothers. Carotene and polyphenols present in these flours act as antioxidants.<br>
Soya flour has the highest protein content among the plant products and has important fatty acids viz., linoleic and linolenic acid (also called omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids) which are essential for the heart functioning and lower the blood stream cholesterol. Further it supplies phytoestrogens which minimise the effect of estrogen women.<br><br>
Bengal gram utilised in composition is rich source of folic acid, which is very important for lactating ladies.Buckwheat is rich source of rutin, which increases capillary fragility and also supplies iodine, important for lactating mother.Compositions comprising of Group B plants i.e. with adaptogenic and imunomodulating properties are good for general health<br>
Composition comprising of only Group C plants i.e. having hepatoprotective properties is good for liver functioning. Minimum processing is done to make biscuits, as all the therapeutic herbs are shade dried, ground to make powder while it has been added without processing in powder form of the composition therefore chances "of loss of activity has been minimised.By utilising whole plant drugs and all natural components as such there is a least chance of toxicity or side effects.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
