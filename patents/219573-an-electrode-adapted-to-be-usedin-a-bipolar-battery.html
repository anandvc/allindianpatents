				<td>An electrode, a method for manufacLuring an electrode and a bipolar battery.<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode as defined in the preamble of claim 1. The invention also relates to a method for manufacturing an electrode as defined in the preamble of claur, 13. The invention further relates to a biplate assembly as defined in the preamble of claim 9 and a bipolar battery as defined in claim 22.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Traditionally, electrodes to bipolar batteries have been manufactured using some type of conductive carrier, a metal griri or mesh, to increase the conductivity between the electrode and the biplate of the biplate assembly, and to support the electrode during transport and assembly. Active material in the form of powder has also been used, which has been compressed to achieve a suitable thickness and density.<br>
Planar electrodes may have any shape, but has to be formed into the desired shape by cutting the supporting metal Structure and the compressed powder. In doing this there is a high risk that the electrode is damaged due to vibrations fron cutting the metal carrier. Also sharp conductive edges may be the result of shaping the electrode.<br>
There is a need for an electrode that is easy to shape, and that are safe to handle during assembly of biplates and bipolar batteries.<br>
Susnmary of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an electrode, which is easy to manufacture into a desired shape compared to prioi arc electrodes.<br>
This object is achieved by an electrode as defined in the characterizing portion of claim 1, and a method for manufacturing an electrode as defined by the characterizing portion of claim 13,<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a biplate assembly and a bipolar battery comprising an electrode this is easy to manufacture and handle during assembly.<br>
This further object is achieved by a biplate assembly as defined in the characterizing portion of claim 9, and a bipolar battery as defined in the characterising portion of claim 22.<br>
An advantage with the present invention is that the electrode is easier to manufacture compared to prior art electrodes.<br>
Another advantage is that the cost for manufacturing the electrode is reduced compared to conventional prior art electrodes having a supportive carrier.<br>
Still another advantage is that the weight of the electrode is reduced, since no conductive support structure is necessary within the<br>
Still another advantage is that no conductive sharp edges will occur on a shaped electrode, as may be the case when cutting an electrode having a metal supportive structure.<br>
Still another advantage is that it is easier to obtain s flat electrode from pressed powder compared with electrodes having<br>
a metal carrier, since the metal carrier is deformed during the pressing of the powder -<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention v/ill be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the disclosed bipolar electrochemica battery and the biplate assembly.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The different embodiments shown in the appended drawings are not to scale or proportion, but exaggerated to point out different important features for the sake of clarity.<br>
Fig. I shows a planar view of an electrode being arranged on non-conductive carrier according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a cross-sectional view along A-A in figure I<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross-sectional view of a bipolar battery including a biplate assembly having an electrode according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a view of an apparatus for manufacturing an electrode according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 5 shows a detailed view of the means for arranging activi powder onto a non-conductive carrier.<br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a non-metal carrier 10 made from a conductive material,, such as a woven carbon fibre cloth, or non-conductive material, such as a polymer preferably made from polypropylene, having a predetermined width w and an arbitrary length. The carrier 10 is preferably arranged in a roll, see figure 4. A compressed powder 11 13 arranasd on r&gt;.p r-.i-.T-,_iv.c.i- = i<br>
carrier 10 and a desired shape of the electrode 13 is outlined by the dashed line 12. The compressed powder 11 and the carrier 10 are cut along line 12 to form the electrode 13.<br>
The use of pressed powder is disclosed in the PCT application PCT/SE02/01359, with the title "A method for manufacturing a biplate assembly, a biplate assembly and a bipolar battery" by the same applicant. In that application the powder is pressed directly onto the biplate to achieve thin electrodes having lees active material. By pressing the active powder onto a non-metal carrier, the manufacturing process is further simplified.<br>
For a NiMH bipolar battery, two different active materials need to be provided for manufacturing the electrodes. The positive active material in a NiMH battery manufactured according to the invention is preferably made from spherical nickel hydroxide (supplied by OMG, Finland); Nickel 210 fiber (supplied by INCO, USA); and Powdered Cobalt (obtainable from various suppliers). The negative material is preferably reade with Metal Hydride (supplied by Treibacher. Austria); and Nickel 255 fiber (supplied by INCO, USAJ. There are numerous suppliers of all these materials, particularly in Japan and China, where the majority of Nickel Metal Hydride cells presently are manufactured.<br>
No other materials,- such as conductive additives, binders, etc. arc normally included. The nickel fibers INCO 210 and 255 serve as tne conductive additives and make contact with the conductive biplate, conducting current from the active material directly to the conductive biplate.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view along A-A in figure 1, where lines 12 indicate the desired shape of the finished electrode 13. The compressed powder 11 is mainlv eihuated on<br>
top of the carrier 10. During compression of the active powder, some amount of the active powder may migrate to the other side of the carrier 10 depending on the structure of the carrier 10. If a random structure of polymer is applied, almost nothing will migrate through the carrier 10, but if a grid structure of polymer is used more active material will end up on the other side of the carrier 10, i.e, the carrier 10 could be placed in the center of the electrode 13. The reference numeral 13 indicates the electrode after cutting along lines 12.<br>
Figure 3 shows a bipolar battery 15, preferably a NiMH battery, having a positive 16 and a negative 17 end terminal. A biplate assembly 20 is provided comprising a biplate 21, a positive electrode 27 of positive active material 22 arranged on a non-metal carrier 10, and a negative electrode 26 of negative active material 23 arranged on a non-metal carrier 10. The active materials 22, 23 are powder pressed onto the carrier 10. The bipolar battery contains in this example only one biplate assembly, but several biplate assemblies may naturally be included in a bipolar battery.<br>
The positive end terminal 16 has a positive electrode 27 and the negative end terminal 17 has a negative electrode 38. A separator 24 containing electrolyte is arranged between adjacent positive 27 and negative 28 electrodes. The non-metal carrier 10 of each electrode 27, 28 is preferably arranged towards the separator 24, as indicated in figure 3. The surface of the sides 25 and 26, respectively, of the biplate 21 is preferably a bit rough to keep the electrodes in place during manufacture and operations. The surface of the end terminals may naturally also be rough for the<br>
A hydrophobia barrier IS, as disclosed in the PCT application PCT/SE02/01645, with the title "A bipolar battery, a method for manufacturing a bipolar battery and a biplate assembly" by the same applicant, is provided around the positive 27 and negative 28 electrodes respectively to prevent electrolyte paths between adjacent cells, A housing 2S provides a sealing of the battery 15. The details of the construction of the battery provides a bipolar battery 15 with an electrolyte seal, the hydrophobia barrier 18, for each cell and a gas seal, the housing 2&amp;, for all cells in the battery.<br>
The electrodes 27 and 28 including a non-metal carrier 10, preferably a non-conductive carrier, according to the invention may naturally be used in any type of bipolar battery having separately made electrodes.<br>
Figure 4 shows an apparatus 30 for manufacturing an electrode having a non-metal carrier 10 according to the invention. A roll 31 with a tensioning device, such as a spring, supplies a' non-conductive carrier 10 to the apparatus and two rollers' 32 and 33 rotate to pull the carrier 10 under tension in to the apparatus. A distributor 37 arranges active powder 38 on the carrier 10, and a spreader 39 levels the active powder 38 before the powder is compressed between th0 rollers 32 and 33. The powder 38 may either be arranged continuously on Che carrier 10, or in a discrete fashion as shown in figure 4.<br>
A compressed powder 11 is thus arranged on the carrier 10 and a cutter 34 forms the electrode into the desired shape. Scrap material after cutting is ground and recycled, which is possible due to the use of the non-metal carrier.<br>
An agitator 36 is provided within the powder container and provides powder with a uniform density to the distributor 37, which collects powder in &amp; uniform volume and distributes it:<br>
to the carrier 10. This process is more described in connection with figure 5 below.<br>
The powder container is provided with a level sensor 40, and a level control unit 41 Opens a valve 42 to add more powder from a powder supply 43 when the level in the powder container is too low.<br>
A sensor 44 is also provided at the spreader 39 to monitor the amount of powder arranged on th© carrier 10 prior to leveling and pressing. The sensor 44 §ends a signal back to the distributor, via a control unit 45, to alter the rotation speed and thereby change the amount of powder distributed to the non-metal carrier 10.<br>
Figure 5 shows a detailed view of the mechanism distributing the active powder 50 onto the carrier 10- The purpose of the. agitator 36 is to provide a uniform density powder to the distributor 37. and prevent "bridges*, i.e. voids, that could occur in the powder supply container. The distributor 37 is provided with grooves 51 having a uniform volume, which are filled with the powder 50 during rotation, and the active powder is thereafter distributed to the carrier 10 in a suitable amount.<br>
The preferred method uses the carrier 10 as a film to convey the loose powder into the rolling mill for compaction, and the process is conducted at room ambient conditions. The time, or rate of production, is most dependent upon the powder spreading mechanism and the roll diameters. An acceptable production rate require 4 inch (approx. 10 cm) diameter rolls thac have a preferred speed of 1.5 to 3 meters per minute. A lower production rate would be feasible, but not economical. Maximum speed is dependent on the equipment including material<br>
handling to cut the strip to electrode size and convey them tc subsequent steps, such as assembling steps.<br>
The physical dimensions of the finished product {electrode) depend on the equipment specified. For heat transfer considerations at the final battery level, the equipment is limited to manufacture electrodes 6 inches (approx, 15 cm) wade. The thickness of the electrodes is in the range of 0.002 to 0.050 inches (approx. 0.05 to 1,3 mm), with a preferred range of 0.010 to 0.035 inches (approx. 0.25 to 0.90 mm). The final electrodes normally have the shape of a rectangle, but other shapes are naturally possible.<br>
The electrode thickness depends upon the ratio of power required to energy required. Higher power applications require thinner electrodes. The non-conductive carrier must transport the powder into the rolls without the material totally sieving through it. The final location of the carrier material can be anywhere Within the electrode, but it is preferable to be closest to the side of the electrode that is placed in contact with the separator. The material should allow sufficient particles to penetrate so the compressive forces compact the powder, and do not form the non-conductive carrier into a film.<br><br><br>
