				<td>The invention relates to a flexible brush head for a toothbrush.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a flexible, adaptable brush head which allows better cleaning of the teeth as a whole.<br>
This object is achieved by a brush head according to claim 1.<br>
The design of the brush head according to the invention makes it very flexible. It has a bristle carrier which is made of a first, hard but elastic plastic and is divided up into at least two segments, which are located one behind the other along the longitudinal axis of the brush head, by at least one recess, which passes through the bristle carrier, in the form of a tunnel, transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the brush head.<br>
The segments of the bristle carrier, and preferably also the tunnel, extend over the entire width of the brush head, the tunnel preferably being filled with a second, rubber-elastic plastic, which is much softer than the first plastic of the bristle carrier, with the result that there is no risk of the tunnel being contaminated. The design described allows the individual segments of the bristle carrier to be deflected with respect to one another, which results in the brush head being flexible. Since the brush head can bend about an axis running transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the brush head, adaptation both to the out sides and the insides of the teeth is possible, this allowing more careful cleaning of the teeth, of the spaces between the teeth and of the gum line. Slight turning of the individual segments of the bristle carrier with respect to one another, that is to say slight torsion of the brush head, is also possible, this further improving adaptation of the brushing surface, which is produced by the bristles or bristle clusters, to the shapes of the individual teeth and of<br><br>
the teeth as a whole, and thus further improving the cleaning operation. If the brush head is subjected to pronounced or excessive pressure, it bends to a correspondingly more pronounced extent and thus compensates for some of the pressure. This means that gentler and more careful cleaning is possible.<br>
If the brush head has more than just two segments and, accordingly, more than one tunnel, then the flexibility of the brush head increases and the effects outlined are enhanced.<br>
The flexibility of the brush head can be increased further if the regions of the bristle carrier which bound the tunnels on the bristle-carrying side of the bristle carrier and on the side which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side of the bristle carrier are configured such that they can be expanded and/or compressed in the longitudinal direction of the brush head. In order to achieve greater stability of the brush head, it is expedient for these regions to be configured in the expansible form described just on one side in each case, and advantageously on the bristle-carrying side. A configuration in the form of a web which is folded in the manner of an accordion is particularly suitable. A bristle-carrier region which is configured in expansible form with or without folding and bounds the tunnel of said sides yields elastically to its limit of expansion and thus acts as a bending-limiting means. When the limit of expansion is reached, further deflection or turning of the segments with respect to one another is only possible by force being applied. Automatic return of the segments into their original position is effected predominantly by the elastic restoring action of said bristle-carrier regions which bound the tunnels, and also by the second, soft, elastic plastic, with which the tunnel is filled and which is joined firmly to the first, hard, elastic plastic of the bristle carrier-<br>
For producing a brush head of the type described, it is advantageous if, for the case where<br><br>
more than one tunnel is provided in the brush head, the tunnels are connected to one another, since it is easier in this way for them to be filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic. If the intention is to produce entire toothbrushes, then it is advantageous to form the brush head integrally on a brush handle or a plug-on part and to produce said handle or plug-on part likewise from the first, hard but elastic plastic.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the brush head and toothbrushes with brush heads according to the invention form the subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>

Figure 5b shows an illustration where the toothbrush illustrated in Figure 5a is subjected to bending stress.<br>
Figures la-g show a toothbrush 10 with part of a brush handle 12 and a brush head 14 with a bristle carrier 16. The bristle carrier 16, which consists of a first, hard but elastic plastic, is subdivided into five segments 17 {Figures la. 1d) by tunnels 20, which pass through the bristle carrier 16 over its entire width, different numbers of rows of bristles combined to form bristle clusters 18 being anchored in said five segments. The segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16 extend, as do the tunnels 20, over the entire width b of the brush head 14 in each case (Figures 1f, 1g). The tunnels 20 between the segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16 {Figures 1d, 1g) are filled with a second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic, which is joined firmly to the first, hard, elastic plastic of the bristle carrier 16. The tunnels 20 are thus entirely surrounded by the hard, elastic plastic of the bristle carrier 16. On the bristle-carrying side of the brush head 14 and<br><br>
on that side of the brush head 14 which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, the tunnels are bounded by regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16, said regions being web-like and of thin design and thus being very flexible.<br>
In the center of its sides forming the lateral border of the brush head 14, the bristle carrier 16 has a lateral groove 30 which is the same height as the tunnels 20 (Figures lb, le, 1f). The tunnels 20 are connected to one another via the lateral groove 30, which runs more or less around the entire brush head 14 and is likewise filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic.<br>
The brush head 14 and brush handle 12 are connected integrally to one another via the segment 17' of the bristle carrier 16, said segment 17' being adjacent to the brush handle 12, it being the case that the brush handle 12 likewise consists of the hard but elastic plastic of the bristle carrier 16 (Figures la to 1d) . The brush handle 12 has a handle groove 26 which extends, on the bristle-carrying side of the toothbrush 10, along the longitudinal axis 24 of the toothbrush 10 (Figure la) . Just in front of the brush head 14, this handle groove 26 divides (Figure la) and runs obliquely toward the brush head 14 along the lateral sides of the brush handle 12 and merges into the lateral groove 30 (Figure lb) . In the same way as the lateral groove 30, the handle groove 26 is filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic.<br>
As a result of the large number of segments 17, into which the bristle carrier 16 is subdivided by the tunnels 20, and on account of the relatively thin and thus very flexible regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16, the brush head 14 as a whole is very flexible and can easily be bent and turned with torsional movement along the center longitudinal axis 24' of the brush head 14. This achieves better adaptation of the brushing surface to the curves of the teeth and the spaces between the teeth as well as better cleaning.<br><br>
The tunnels 20 thus increase the flexibility of the brush head 14. However, at the same time, the regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16, which bound the tunnels 20 on the bristle-carrying side of the brush head 14 and on that side of the brush head 14 which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, reduce the risk of part of the brush head 14 being bitten off during use.<br>
The integral connection between the brush handle 12 and brush head 14 and the connection of the tunnels 2 0 to one another via the lateral groove 30 of the bristle carrier 16 permit, together with the connection of the lateral groove 30 and handle groove 26, very straightforward production of the entire toothbrush with the brush head 14 according to the invention by two-component injection molding.<br>
An embodiment which is modified slightly with respect to the embodiment outlined in Figures la to 1g is illustrated in Figures 2a to 2e.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Figures 2a to 2e shows a toothbrush 10 with a further embodiment of the brush head 14 and with a short section of a brush handle 12. The brush head 14, which has a bristle carrier 16 subdivided into three segments 17 by tunnels 20, is formed integrally on the brush handle 12 (Figure 2a). The first segment 17' of the bristle carrier 16, said segment 17' being adjacent to the brush handle 12 and also having a number of bristle clusters 18 anchored in it, forms a transition region 32 to the brush handle 12.<br>
As in the embodiment illustrated in Figures la to 1g, it is also the case here that tunnels 20 are located between the segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16, which extend over the entire width of the brush head 14, said tunnels 20 likewise extending over the entire width of the brush head 14 {Figures 2a, 2b, 2d, 2e) and being filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic.<br>
As in the embodiment shown in Figures la to Ig, it is also the case here that a lateral groove 30,<br><br>
which is made in the side of the bristle carrier 16 and is filled with the soft, elastic plastic, connects the tunnels 20 to one another. For the purpose of straightforward production, the integrally formed brush handle 12 also has a groove 2 6 on the two lateral surfaces, said groove merging into the groove 30 of the bristle carrier 16 in the transition region 32 (Figures 2b, 2d and 2e) and being filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic.<br>
Figures 2d and 2e show just the core, which consists of the first, hard but elastic plastic, i.e. the filling of the tunnels 20 and of the grooves 26 and 30 made of the second, rubber-elastic plastic is not illustrated.<br>
The tunnels 20 are entirely surrounded by the first, hard, elastic plastic of the bristle carrier 16. The regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16, which bound the tunnels 20 on the bristle-carrying side of the toothbrush 10 (Figures 2b, 2d, 2e} , are very thin and of slightly curved design (Figures 2b, 2c), with the result that they appear on the bristle-carrying side of the brush head 14 as hollowed channels (Figure 2a). Under use-induced loading, these slightly curved regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16 extend (Figure 2d} and, in the fully stressed state, resist any further bending of the bristle carrier 16 (Figure 2e) . The regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16 which are formed in this way thus, on the one hand, increase flexibility and, on the other hand, act as a bending-limiting means, which prevents excessive bending of the brush head.<br>
The regions 22' of the bristle carrier 16, which bound the tunnels 20 on the side which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, are likewise thin and elastic, with the result that they are compressed elastically when the bristle carrier 16 is bent during use of the toothbrush, as is illustrated in Figure 2e.<br>
The bristle clusters which are designated by 18' in Figures 2b, 2d and 2e and belong to the rows<br><br>
adjacent to the tunnels 20 are positioned obliquely. As Figures 2b, 2d and 2e show, the oblique positioning is such that the bristle clusters 18' , which are each arranged on both sides of a tunnel 20, are inclined toward one another, thus covering over the tunnel region located therebetween (Figures 2b and 2d). Those receiving holes which are formed in the segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16 and are intended for the bristle clusters 18' are correspondingly positioned obliquely.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Figures 3a to 3g is of the same basic design as the brush head 14 shown in Figures 2a-2e. However, the tunnels 2 0 widen in a trumpet-like manner toward the border of the brush head 14 {Figure 3a) . The regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16, which bound the tunnels 20 on the bristle-carrying side of the toothbrush 10 {Figures 3c, 3f, 3g) , are likewise thin and of slightly curved design, with the result that toward the bristle-carrying side, together with the borders of the segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16, they too form hollowed channels running transversely over the brush head 14 {Figure 3a) . Since the tunnels 2 0 widen in a trumpet-like manner toward the border of the brush head 14, the channels on the bristle-carrying side of the brush head 14, which are formed by the regions 22, also appear in plan view in a form in which they widen in a trumpet-like manner toward the border of the brush head 14 (Figure 3a) . Just like the regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16 in the embodiment described in Figures 2a to 2e, it is also the case here that the regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16 increase flexibility and act as a bending-limiting means.<br>
The central segment 17 and the segment 17" of the bristle carrier 16, said segment 17" being located opposite the brush handle 12, are subdivided in this embodiment into two parts 17a, 17b by an interspace 34 which extends over the entire width of the brush head 14 (Figures 3c, 3e} . This interspace 34 connects the tunnels 2 0 to one another and is likewise filled with<br><br>
the second, soft, elastic plastic (Figure 3d). The interspace 34 with its soft, rubber-elastic filling makes it possible for the segments 17 of the bristle carrier 16 to be tilted along, and transversely with respect to, the longitudinal axis 24 of the brush head 14.<br>
A small web 36 at that end of the brush head 14 which is located opposite the brush handle 12, said web connecting the bristle-carrying part 17"a to the part 17"b of the segment 17", said part 17"b being located opposite the bristle-carrying part, prevents the two parts 17"a and 17"b of the segment 17" from spreading apart during use and prevents the join between these parts 17"a, 17"b and the soft, elastic plastic in the interspace 34 from being released {Figure 3c). The segment 17' of the bristle carrier 16, said segment being located at the other end of the brush head 14 and being adjacent to the brush handle 12, is not separated by the interspace 34. Said segment merges into the brush handle 12 {Figure 3c), which is produced from the same hard, elastic plastic as the bristle carrier 16.<br>
The basic design of the brush head 14 shown in Figures 4a to 4g is the same as that of the brush head 14 illustrated in Figures la to 1g. The two have a bristle carrier 16 which is subdivided into five segments 17 by tunnels 20 and is made of hard, elastic plastic.<br>
The difference between the embodiment shown in Figures la to 1g and the embodiment shown in Figures 4a to 4g is that in that embodiment of the brush head 14 which is outlined in Figures 4a to 4g the bristle carrier 16 has a groove 28 instead of a lateral groove 30, this groove 28 extending, along the center longitudinal axis 24', on the rear side, which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, of the brush head 14 (Figure 4c) . The groove 28, which is filled with the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic, passes through the bristle carrier 16 such that the<br><br>
tunnels 20 are connected to one another via the groove 28 (Figures 4c, 4d, 4f, 4g) ,<br>
For cost-effective production by two-component injection molding, the brush handle 12 has on the rear side, which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, of the toothbrush 10 a handle groove 26 which, in the region of the brush head 14, merges into the groove 28 along the center longitudinal axis 24' of the brush head 14. Both grooves 26 and 28 are filled with the soft, rubber-elastic plastic (Figures 4c, 4d, 4e) .<br>
The possible variations of the brush head 14 according to the invention are by no means covered in full by the embodiments described and illustrated in the figures. As is also made clear, in particular, by the exemplary embodiments shown in Figures 2a to 2e and 3a to 3g, the geometrical configuration of the bristle carrier 16, as seen in plan view, may be virtually of any desired shape. It is thus not necessary for the bristle carriers 16 and their segments 17 to be of rectangular design, as is illustrated in the examples of Figures la to 1g and 4a to 4g. The same also applies for the tunnels 20 between the segments 17 of the bristle carriers 16, as is illustrated in Figures 3a, 3c, 3f. Variations in the outwardly visible distribution between parts made of the first, hard, elastic plastic and the second, soft, rubber-elastic plastic for design reasons are, of course, likewise conceivable.<br>
In all the exemplary embodiments shown, the tunnels 20 extend over the entire width of the bristle carrier 16 and run continuously from side border to side border. It is, then, also conceivable for the tunnels 2 0 to be of non-continuous configuration, i.e. for the tunnels 20 to be interrupted by an intermediate element.<br>
It is also possible to dispense with the tunnels 2 0 being filled with the second, soft, elastic plastic. In such an embodiment, the lateral groove 30 and/or the groove 2 8 and the handle groove 2 6 can be<br><br>
omitted. As a result, the brush handle 12 and the bristle carrier 16, subdivided into segments 17 by the tunnels 20, of such an embodiment consist just of a single material, that is to say the first, hard, elastic plastic.<br>
It is possible for the brush head 14 designed according to the invention to be used not just for a manual toothbrush, as shown, but also for plug-on toothbrushes, as are used for electric toothbrushes. In the case of such a plug-on toothbrush, the brush head 14 according to the invention is connected to a plug-on part.<br>
Instead of the brush head 14 being designed integrally with the brush handle 12 or the plug-on part, it is also possible for the brush head 14 to be connected to the brush handle 12 or the plug-on part in an exchangeable manner.<br>
The configuration of the bristles or bristle clusters 18 may likewise be varied, as has already been indicated in Figure 3b by the different lengths of the bristle clusters 18 and the brushing surfaces, some of which are cut obliquely. As has been mentioned, it is also possible for crosswise bristles or bristle clusters 18 which are positioned obliquely with respect to one another, as is illustrated in Figures 2b and 2d, to be expedient and additionally to aid better cleaning of the teeth as a whole.<br>
It is also possible for those regions 22 of the bristle carriers 16 which bound the tunnels 20 to be of different configurations. As described for the embodiments shown in Figures 2a-2e and 3a-3g, the flexibility of the brush head 14 can be increased if the regions 22 of the bristle carriers 16 are thin and of slightly curved configuration. However, the capacity for expansion of these regions 22 in the longitudinal direction of the brush head 14 may also be improved, for example, by the regions 22 being thinned out toward their center. A very expansible, and thus very advantageous, form of these regions 22 is achieved by a<br><br>
thin configuration which is folded in the manner of an accordion in the longitudinal direction of the brush head 14. This also applies correspondingly for the regions 22' on the rear side, which is located opposite the bristle-carrying side, of the bristle carrier 16, said regions 22' being compressed elastically when the bristle-carrier segments 17 are deflected by force being applied to the bristle clusters 18.<br>
A configuration of these regions 22 of the bristle carrier 16 such as that illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b also results in very high flexibility of the brush head. Figures 5a and 5b show a toothbrush 10 which has a brush head 14 and is constructed analogously to the embodiment shown in Figures 2a to 2e. However, of the thin regions 22 and 22', which cover over the tunnels 20, in the embodiment shown here the regions 22 on the bristle-carrying side of the brush head 14 are subdivided into two sections 22a and 22b by a parting plane 21 extending over the entire width of the brush head 14, said two sections being in closing contact in the normal state, as shown in Figure 5a. Under bending stress, the parting plane 21 widens to form a gap 21' , as is illustrated in Figure 5b, which permits a large degree of bending. The restoring force of the soft, elastic plastic material in the tunnels 20 ensures that, as the bending stress decreases, the gap 21' closes again to the full extent and the sections 22a and 22b of the regions 22 butt against one another again with closing contact. It is also the case in terms of torsional stress along the longitudinal axis 24' of the bristle carrier 16 that the parting plane 21 in the regions 22 increases the flexibility of the brush head 14.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. Flexible brush head for toothbrushes (10), having a brrstie carrier (16) which consists of a first, hard, elastic piastic material, in which bristles are anchored, these bristles being combined to form bristle clusters (18) and projecting from a bristle-carrying, top side of the bristle carrier (16), and which is subdivided into in¬terconnected segments (17) arranged one behind the other along the longitudinal axis (24) of the brush head (14), the bristle carrier (16) being subdivlded into segments (17) by in each case one cutout (20) In the bristle carrier (16), said cutout running between adjacent segments (17) and extending transversely to the longitudinal axis (24) of the brush head (14), characterized in that each cutout is designed as a tunnel (20) which, both on the top side the the bristle carrier (16) and on the bottom side of the bristle carrier (16), which is located opposite the top side. is bounded by a region (22,22') of the bristle carrier (16), which extends between adjacent segments (1), adjacent segments (17) on the bottom side of the bristle carrier (16) being connected to one another via the region (22'), which bounds the tunnel (20) located between them.<br>

10.	Brush head as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 9, wherein each tunnel (20) is filled<br>
with a second, soft, elastic plastic material.<br>
11.	Brush head as claimed In Claims 9 and 10, wherein, laterally, the bristle carrier<br>
(16) has a lateral groove (30) via wrhich the tunnels (20) are connected to one<br>
another and with is filled with the second, soft, elastic plastic material.<br>
12.	Brush head as claimed In Claims 9 and 10, wherein a groove (28) which extends<br>
along the centre longitudinal axis (24") of the brush head (14), is arranged on the<br>
bottom side of the bristie carrier (16), passes through the bristle carrier (16), con¬<br>
necting the tunnels (20) to one another in the process, and is filled with the<br>
second, soft, elastic plastic material.<br>
13.	Brush head as claimed in Claims 9 and 10, wherein an interspace (34) which<br>
extends over the entire width of the bristle carrier (16), separates at least some of<br>
