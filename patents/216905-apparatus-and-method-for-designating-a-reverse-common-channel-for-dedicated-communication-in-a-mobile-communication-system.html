				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DESIGNATING A REVERSE<br>
COMMON CHANNEL FOR DEDICATED COMMUNICATION<br>
IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a reverse common channel<br>
communication apparatus and method in a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method<br>
for designating a reverse common channel for dedicated communication with a<br>
specific mobile station.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventional CDMA mobile communication systems, which primarily<br>
provide voice service, have evolved into IMT-2000 standard systems. In addition<br>
to voice service, IMT-2000 systems can provide high quality voice service,<br>
moving picture service, and Internet browsing.<br>
Data is communicated on dedicated channels and common channels in a<br>
mobile communication system. Dedicated channels and common channels are<br>
available on both the forward and reverse links. The common channels are so<br>
named because each common channel is commonly shared by a plurality of<br>
mobile stations (MSs). If more than one of the MSs attempt a call on a common<br>
channel at the same time, contention occurs, impeding reliable communications.<br>
The contention problem of common channels is more serious on the reverse link<br>
than on the forward link.<br>
On the other hand, no channel contention occurs on a dedicated channel<br>
because the dedicated channel is literally dedicated to one-to-one communication<br>
between a base station (BS) and an individual mobile station. Therefore, the<br>
message transmission success rate is high on the dedicated channel.<br>
Due to the low transmission success rate on common channels, an MS<br>
will attempt to access a BS repeatedly on a common channel. Consequently,<br>
resources are misused and inter-channel interference increases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus<br>
and method for communicating between a BS and an MS on common channels<br>
with an increased transmission performance in a CDMA communication system.<br>

communication between a BS and a particular MS in a CDMA communication<br>
system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for designating a reverse common channel to be dedicated as a one-to-one<br>
communication link between a BS and an MS in a CDMA communication<br>

information required for common channel designation and information about a<br>
common power control channel to the MS, and the MS spreads user data with the<br>
designated spreading code according to the control message.<br>

constructing messages in a BS signaling layer and interfacing between BS layers<br>
in order to designate a reverse common channel to be dedicated for one-to-one<br>
communication between a BS and a particular MS in a CDMA communication<br>
system.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>

reserves a predetermined reverse common channel as a designated channel and<br>
sets a reservation time when a message is generated that requires a response<br>
message on the reverse common channel. Then, the base station generates<br>
designated channel indicating parameters including a reverse common channel<br>
designation indicator and an action time and transmits the generated message<br>
together with the designated channel indicating parameters to a mobile station.<br>
The base station checks whether a response message has been received on the<br>
designated reverse common channel within the reservation time and releases the<br>
reverse common channel from the designated mode if the response message has<br>
been received within the reservation time or the response message has not been<br>
received when the reservation time expires.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of designating a reverse common channel to be dedicated in a mobile<br>
station of a CDMA communication system. The mobile station receives a<br>
message on a forward common channel. The mobile station analyses the received<br>
forward common channel message, sets the reverse common channel to a<br>
designated mode if the received message has designated channel indicating<br>
parameters that includes a reverse common channel designation indicator and an<br>
action time for designation, and generates a response message for the received<br>
message. Then, the mobile station designates the reverse common channel to be<br>
dedicated by assigning a designated channel spreading code to the reverse<br>
common channel and transmits the response message on the designated reverse<br>
common channel at the action time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention is intended to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
designating a reverse common channel to be dedicated for one-to-one<br>
communication between a BS and an MS in a CDMA communication system,<br>
covering the structure of a message generated from layer 3 of the BS, inter-layer<br>
interfacing, the structure of a message generated from the MS in response to a<br>
received message, and a communication method between the BS and the MS.<br>
Designation of a reverse common channel to be dedicated can be implemented in<br>
a LAC (Link Access Control) layer as well as in a signaling layer described in the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention. When message fields are formed<br>
not by the signaling layer but by the LAC layer, the layers may be interfaced in a<br>
different manner.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention provides an<br>
apparatus and method for designating a reverse common channel to be dedicated<br>
and an inter-protocol layer interfacing method. For this purpose, a BS transmits a<br>
control message on a forward common channel to an MS. This control message<br>
includes long code information representing the spreading code for common<br>
channel designation and common power control channel information. The MS<br>
responds to the control message with a response message. In this case, the reverse<br>
common channel designation relieves the MS of the constraint of competing with<br>
other MSs for access to the common channel. In the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, reverse common channels include a reverse access channel<br>
(R-ACH), a reverse common control channel (R-CCCH), and a reverse enhanced<br>
access channel (R-EACH).<br>
The reverse common channel designation ensures a rapid response time in<br>
transmitting a message on a designated reverse common channel, increases the<br>
transmission success rate of the reverse common channel, and reduces inter-<br>
channel interference caused by message re-transmission. Further, it decreases the<br>
number of fields added by an MS LAC layer, thereby reducing errors that occur<br>
during message transmission.<br>
Now, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates the signal flow between the BS and the MS in a<br>
common channel designating procedure for the case that the BS requests that the<br>
MS designate a common channel to be dedicated and the MS receives a message<br>
including parameters necessary for common channel designation from the BS,<br>
according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The parameters<br>
include designated channel indication including field<br>
(DESIGNATED_MODE_INCL), a designated channel indicator<br>
(DESIGNATED_MODE), the address of a common power control channel<br>
(DAM_ADDRESS: Designated Access Mode_Address), the data rate<br>
(RATE_WORD), and the action time (ACTION_ TIME). Here, the action time<br>
may be added to a message or preset in a system. When the action time is added<br>
to a message for transmission, the message may be a common channel<br>
designating message or an access parameter message.<br>
Therefore, when the BS is to designate a common channel to be dedicated<br>
for one-to-one communication with a particular MS, it transmits a message with<br>
message fields including the above parameters constructed by a BS L3, LAC, or<br>
MAC layer to the MS on a forward common channel. Then, the MS analyses the<br>
message. If the MS confirms that the message includes the designated channel<br>
indicating parameters, it designates a reverse common channel to be dedicated<br>
according to the parameters and transmits a response message to the BS on the<br>
designated reverse common channel in step 102. The response message may be a<br>
response to the received message or a user data traffic message. Since user traffic<br>
data is transmitted after common channel designation, the user data traffic<br>
message, if it is longer than a frame length supported by a physical layer, is<br>
segmented prior to transmission. For designation of the reverse common channel,<br>
the MS may use an ESN (Electronic Serial Number) mask, a private long code<br>
mask, or a specific R-CCCH long code mask assigned to a specific MS by a BS<br>
through prior scheduling. When the scheduled R-CCCH mask is used, the MS<br>
constructs the mask using the address of a common power control channel that is<br>
referred to for designation of a reverse common channel.<br>
A description will be made of a reverse common channel designating<br>
method in signaling layer L3, LAC, or MAC of the BS.<br>
Table 1 lists exemplary messages transmitted from the BS to the MS on a<br>
forward common channel. Upon receipt of these messages, the MS should<br>
transmit response messages for the messages to the BS on a reverse common<br>
channel. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the BS includes<br>
the designated channel indicating parameters in the messages shown in Table 1<br>
and the MS transmits corresponding response messages to the BS after<br>
designating the reverse common channel based on the designated channel<br>
indicating parameters, by way of example.<br>

Referring to Table 1, if the BS transmits a status request message to the<br>
MS on a forward common signaling channel (f-csch), the MS transmits a status<br>
response message to the BS on a reverse common signaling channel (r-csch).<br>
When the MS transmits the exemplary messages of Table 1 on a reverse common<br>
channel in the conventional mobile communication system, the messages may not<br>
reach the BS reliably and thus need to be retransmitted. The retransmission may<br>
incur interference with other MSs. However, transmission performance can be<br>
increased by designating the reverse common channel to be dedicated and<br>
transmitting the messages on the designated reverse common channel according<br>
to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
To designate the reverse common channel, the BS"s L3, LAC, or MAC<br>
layer adds designated channel indicating parameters shown in Table 2 to the<br>
forward channel messages of Table 1, according to the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention.<br>

Though not shown in Table 2, the action time is added to the messages<br>
shown in Table 1 or preset in the system. If the action time is added to a<br>
message, a BS signaling layer or LAC layer adds it. On the other hand, if the<br>
system presets the action time, the system estimates time when a message is<br>
transmitted from an MS, considering the time required for transmission of a<br>
message on a common channel to an MS, that is, propagation time delay and<br>
message processing time. The action time may be added to a common channel<br>
designation request message or an access parameter message. If the action time is<br>
added to the access parameter message, the MS receives it when it access the<br>
system and stores it. When the MS receives a common channel designation<br>
command, it transmits a message to the BS based on the stored action time.<br>
The designated channel indicating parameter fields include the four<br>
parameters (or action time in addition) shown in Table 2. In Table 2,<br>
DESIGNATED_MODE is a field that orders the MS to designate a common<br>
channel to be dedicated, the field DAM_ADDRESS represents the address of a<br>
common power control channel, i.e., the index of the common power control<br>
channel that is referred to for control of the transmission power of a message to be<br>
transmitted after common channel designation and the field RATE_WORD<br>
indicates the transmission rate of a designated reverse common channel. The<br>
LAC layer adds a field Action_Time to notify the MS of the time to transmit a<br>
response message after the MS receives an exemplary message as shown in Table<br>
1. The BS adds the two fields when it transmits a particular message or requests<br>
the MS to transmit a response message on the designated common channel.<br>
For designation of the common channel to be dedicated, the<br>
corresponding MS should use a predetermined long code in spreading the reverse<br>
common channel and the BS should reserve a channel element to receive the<br>
reverse channel signal spread with the spreading code.<br>
FIGs. 2 to 7 illustrate procedures of designating a reverse common<br>
channel in a BS L3 and an MS L3 according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, FIGs. 8A to 10 illustrate procedures of designating a reverse common<br>
channel in a BS LAC layer and an MS LAC layer according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and FIGs. 11, 12, and 13 illustrate<br>
procedures of designating a reverse common channel in a BS MAC layer and an<br>
MS MAC layer according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is the signal flow in a procedure for adding information about the<br>
reverse common channel designation in the BS signaling layer, according to a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, layer 3 (L3) of the BS requests reservation of a<br>
channel element before designation of the common channel in step 201, as stated<br>
above. That is, the BS L3 requests a designated mode to be set to designate the<br>
reverse common channel to be dedicated if the BS is to transmit a message that<br>
requires a response message from the MS. The designated mode can be set to<br>
designate the reverse common channel even when the BS is to transmit a message<br>
that acknowledges designation among response-requiring messages. Here, the f-<br>
csch messages listed in Table 1 require response messages from the MS. When a<br>
response message should be received on a designated reverse common channel,<br>
the BS L3 outputs a mode signal ( Designated_Mode) requesting reservation of<br>
channel resources.<br>
Upon receipt of the channel element reservation request from the BS L3,<br>
the resource controller (RC) of the BS transmits a channel element reservation<br>
request signal including reservation action time (CE_Reserve. Request with<br>
Action Time) to the physical layer (PHY) of the BS in step 202. The action time<br>
may be added to a message directed to the MS or preset in the system.<br>
Action Time is set to an appropriate value considering the time until the<br>
BS receives a response message from the MS after the MS receives a forward<br>
common channel message from the BS. Action Time is added in a LAC layer of<br>
the BS. The LAC layer adds one bit for USE_TIME and 6 bits for<br>
ACTION_TIME to set Action Time. The duration (T_designated) of the channel<br>
element reserved state is also set to prevent continuous occupation of the channel<br>
element and misuse of resources in case the BS fails to receive the response<br>
message within a predetermined time. The reservation duration can be set in<br>
consideration of time required for transmission of the forward common channel<br>
message, time required to process the forward common channel message in the<br>
MS, and time taken for other related operations.<br>
The reservation duration, set in step 203 of FIG. 2, is necessary in case<br>
that the MS does not recognize the forward common channel message transmitted<br>
from the BS and thus cannot transmit a response message to the BS. Thus, the<br>
channel element starts to operate at the action time and the channel reserved state<br>
lasts for a time period set in a reservation timer (T_designated). Unless the BS<br>
fails to receive a required response message until the reservation timer expires, it<br>
automatically releases the channel element from the reserved state in order to<br>
prevent the dissipation of resources caused by the continuous reservation of the<br>
channel element. Thus, the timer should be set to an appropriate value.<br>
In step 203, the PHY notifies the RC of information about channel<br>
element reservation. If it is not possible to reserve the channel element, the PHY<br>
generates a signal indicating "reservation unavailable" and the timer value is not<br>
set. If the channel element has been reserved, the PHY generates a reservation<br>
complete signal.<br>
In step 204, the RC transmits a response received from the PHY to the<br>
L3. The BS transmits the thus-constituted message to the MS on the forward<br>
common channel in step 205. The DESIGNATED_MODE is set to 1 in the<br>
message as an indicator that orders the MS to spread the reverse common channel<br>
with a particular long code like the ESN of the MS.<br>
If the L3 receives a signal indicating "reservation unavailable" in step<br>
204, it sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 0 and omits the fields DAM_ADDRESS<br>
and RATE_WORD. In this case, the LAC layer does not add USE_TIME and<br>
ACTION_TIME either. This implies that the corresponding reverse common<br>
channel assumes the same characteristics as a conventional reverse channel. On<br>
the other hand, if the L3 receives a reservation acknowledgment signal in step<br>
204, the L3 sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 1, writes the address of a common<br>
power control channel for reference in the field DAM_ADDRESS, and writes<br>
information about the data rate of a designated channel in the field<br>
RATE_WORD. The LAC layer adds the field USE_TIME and ACTION_TTME.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating the reverse common channel designation<br>
procedure of FIG. 2 in the BS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, if a forward common channel message is generated<br>
in step 500, the BS checks whether the message is used for reverse common<br>
channel designation in step 511. If the message is a designation request message,<br>
the BS request designation in step 513. And BS checks whether there is an<br>
available channel to be reserved in step 515. If channel reservation is possible,<br>
the BS reserves the channel and sets Action Time and T_designated in step 517.<br>
Action Time indicates a time point when the MS transmits the reverse common<br>
channel message and T_designated is a time period for which the BS awaits<br>
receipt of a response message from the MS on a reverse common control channel.<br>
Then, the BS generates the designated channel indicating parameters shown in<br>
Table 2 in steps 519 and 521. The parameters include DESIGNATED_MODE,<br>
DAM_ADDRESS, and RATE_WORD. To designate the reverse common<br>
channel, the BS sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 1 for designating the reverse<br>
common control channel at step 519, and the other parameters for setting the<br>
transmission power and transmission rate of the reverse common control channel<br>
to corresponding values in step 521. Then, the three parameters are added to one<br>
of the messages listed in Table 1 and transmitted at the designated action time on<br>
the forward common control channel.<br>
If the generated message is not a designation request message in step 511<br>
or there is no channel element to be reserved in step 515, the BS sets<br>
DESIGNATED_MODE to 0 in step 523, deletes the other parameter fields in step<br>
525, and transmits the message on the forward common channel.<br>
After transmitting the message (requiring a response from the MS) on the<br>
forward common channel, the BS awaits receipt of the response message from the<br>
MS for the time T_designated.<br>
FIG. 3 is the signal flow within the BS when the BS receives the response<br>
message for the transmitted forward common channel message including<br>
information about the reverse common channel from the MS on the designated<br>
reverse common channel, according a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the L3 of the BS receives the response message from<br>
the MS on the designated reverse common channel in step 301. If the reverse<br>
common channel has not been designated, the BS has, in effect, received the<br>
message on a conventional access channel.<br>
In step 302, the L3 receives the response message from the MS and<br>
notifies the reception to the RC to release the dedicated reverse common channel<br>
in accordance with the response message (Designated_Mode_Release, Request).<br>
In step 303, the RC notifies the PHY that the reverse common channel<br>
should be released from the designated mode. Then, the PHY demodulates the<br>
designated reverse common channel spread with a unique MS long code, (e.g., an<br>
ESN) and releases the reservation of the channel element<br>
In step 304, the PHY notifies the RC that the reservation of the channel<br>
element has been released. Then, the RC notifies the L3 of the release of the<br>
channel element from the reserved state, thereby wholly releasing the reverse<br>
common channel from the designated mode, in step 305.<br>
As described above, for a communication between a BS and a specific<br>
MS on a designated reverse common channel, a channel element is reserved and<br>
the reservation duration of the channel element is set. If the reserved channel<br>
element is available, the BS transmits designated channel indicating parameters to<br>
the MS on a forward common channel at a designated action time. The<br>
designated channel indicating parameters is added to one of the forward common<br>
channel messages shown in Table 1 that require response messages on a reverse<br>
common channel and includes the designated channel indicating parameters of<br>
DESIGNATED_MODE, DAM_ADDRESS, and RATE_WORD as shown in<br>
Table 2. DESIGNATED_MODE may be one bit. If this field is set, a spreading<br>
code that designates the reverse common channel is generated. Here, the BS and<br>
the MS control a preset dedicated long code to be generated for the reverse<br>
common channel. The spreading code can be a long code generated using the<br>
ESN mask of the MS, a public long code mask, or a predetermined long code for<br>
common channel designation.<br>
Table 3 shown below lists message fields added by a LAC layer of the<br>
MS when the MS transmits the response message on the designated reverse<br>
common channel, where message fields labeled with M are always included in a<br>
message and message fields labeled with O can be omitted when a reverse<br>
common channel is designated. The messages shown in Table 3 are LAC layer<br>
messages transmitted from the MS after reverse common channel designation.<br>
In Table 3, the LAC layer adds the fields listed under Basic Mode when<br>
the MS is to transmit the response message on the reverse common channel.<br>
Because the common channel is commonly shared by a plurality of MSs, the MS<br>
should transmit its address to the BS so that the BS can identify the MS.<br>
Therefore, MSID_TYPE, MSID_LEN, and MSID are of necessity added.<br>
However, if the reverse common channel is designated to be dedicated to the<br>
specific MS, the fields MSID_TYPE, MSIDJLEN, and MSID that identify the<br>
MS are not necessary, as shown in the list under the Designated Mode column in<br>
Table 3. The resulting decrease in the number of fields added by the LAC layer<br>
reduces transmission errors.<br>
MSG_TYPE provides transmission characteristics of the message.<br>
ACK_SEQ is the sequence number of the response. The BS confirms message<br>
receipt by checking the stored sequence of its transmitted message and the<br>
sequence of a received message. MSG_SEQ indicates the sequence of a<br>
transmitted message. ACK_REQ is a command requesting a response for the<br>
current message. If this field is set to 1, the BS or the MS that receives the<br>
message should transmit a response message. VALID_ACK indicates the validity<br>
of an acknowledgment and ACK_TYPE indicates termination of the<br>
acknowledgment.<br>
As noted from Table 3, designation of a reverse common channel<br>
increases a transmission success rate and reduces inter-channel interference.<br>
Furthermore, the length of an MS-initiated message is decreased, thereby<br>
reducing message transmission errors.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signal flow in a response message transmission procedure in<br>
the MS after it designates a reverse common channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MS receives a message from the BS on the<br>
forward common channel in step 401. Upon receipt of the message including the<br>
designated channel indicating parameters on the forward common channel, a PHY<br>
of the MS transmits the received message to an L3 of the MS in step 401.<br>
Then, the L3 recognizes the reverse common channel information<br>
included in an L3 service data unit (SDU), generates a response message for the<br>
received message, and transmits the response message to the LAC layer in step<br>
402. Here, the L3 places a designated mode indicator requesting transmission of<br>
the response message on the designated reverse common channel in an message<br>
control status block (MCSB).<br>
The LAC layer recognizes that the response message is to be transmitted<br>
on the designated reverse common channel from an analysis of the MSCB<br>
received together with the L3 SDU, does not add MS ID-related fields shown in<br>
Table 3, and • transmits an LAC PDU (Protocol Data Unit) and PCSB (PDU<br>
Control Status Block) to a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer in step 403. The<br>
LAC PDU excludes the MS ID-related fields and the PCSB includes the<br>
designated mode indicator.<br>
The MAC layer requests a designated_long_code response message to be<br>
spread with a unique long code to the PHY in step 404.<br>
The PHY generates a spreading code using an ESN mask or a private<br>
long code mask for designation of the reverse common channel and transmits the<br>
response message on the designated reverse common channel according to the<br>
command received from the MAC layer, in step and the MS refers to a common<br>
power control channel in transmitting the response message to the BS in step 405.<br>
The ID of the common power control channel can be detected from<br>
DAM_ADDRESS and the transmission rate of the reverse common channel is set<br>
according to RATE_WORD in the message received from the BS.<br>
Consequently, the designated reverse common channel serves similarly as<br>
a dedicated channel.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating the reverse common control channel<br>
message transmitting procedure of FIG. 4 in the MS.<br>
Upon receipt of the message on the forward common control channel in<br>
step 711, the MS checks whether the received message includes the designated<br>
channel indicating parameters in step 713. If it does, the MS constructs a<br>
response message for the received message in step 715 and deletes MS ID-related<br>
fields in step 717. The MS ID-related fields are MSID_TYPE, MSID_LEN, and<br>
MS ID in Table 3. The MS requests a designated long code mask and generates a<br>
spreading code for the reverse common control channel to be designated in step<br>
719. The designated long code mask can be an ESN long code mask, a public<br>
long code mask, or a dedicated long code mask promised between the BS and the<br>
MS. The MS transmits the response message on the designated reverse common<br>
control channel at an action time in step 721 and 725. Unless the received<br>
message includes the designated channel indicating parameters in step 713, the<br>
MS generates a spreading code for the reverse common control channel using a<br>
contention-based common channel long code and transmits the response message<br>
on the reverse common channel.<br>
After receiving the response message, the BS releases the reverse<br>
common control channel from the designated mode in the procedure shown in<br>
FIG. 3. FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure shown in FIG. 3<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, upon receipt of the response message from the MS in<br>
step 611, the BS processes the received message in step 613. In step 615, the BS<br>
checks whether the message has been on the designated reverse common control<br>
channel. In the case of the designated reverse common control channel, the BS<br>
releases the reserved channel element in step 617 and cancels the timer<br>
T_designated in steps 629 and 621.<br>
If the BS fails to receive the response message from the MS within<br>
T_designated while the designated reverse common control channel is in use, the<br>
BS recovers resources by releasing the reserved channel element and stops the<br>
reservation time (T_designated) in order to assign the reverse designated common<br>
channel to another MS.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, for designation of a reverse<br>
common channel, a BS transmits a control message including long code<br>
information indicating a spreading code, channel transmission rate, and<br>
information about a common power control channel to an MS. The MS spreads<br>
user data with a unique long code for the reverse common channel and transmits a<br>
response message for the control message on the designated reverse common<br>
channel. The designation of the reverse common channel to be dedicated ensures<br>
a rapid response time, increases a transmission success rate, and reduces<br>
interference between channels caused by message retransmission. Furthermore,<br>
an MS LAC layer adds a lesser number of fields, resulting in the decrease of<br>
transmission errors.<br>
Now, procedures of designating a common channel in the BS and the MS<br>
will be described according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8A illustrates a procedure of adding reverse common channel<br>
designation information in a BS LAC layer, according to a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, the BS reserves a CE in step 801 prior to<br>
designation of a common channel in a BS LAC layer 2 (L2). When the BS allows<br>
dedicated transmission of user data traffic and the messages shown Table 1 (i.e.,<br>
messages requiring a response from the MS), the L2 commands the CE to be<br>
reserved in step 801.<br>
Upon receipt of a CE reservation request from the L2, the RC transmits a<br>
CE reservation request signal including reservation action time (CE_Reserve.<br>
Request with Action Time) to the PHY of the BS. The action time may be added<br>
to a message directed to the MS or preset in the system. The action time is set to<br>
an appropriate value considering the time until the BS receives a response<br>
message from the MS after the MS receives a forward common channel message<br>
from the BS. including reservation action time (CE_Reserve. Request with Action<br>
Time) to the PHY of the BS. The action time is added by the BS LAC layer or<br>
signaling layer. The duration (T_designated) of the CE reserved state is also set<br>
to prevent continuous occupation of the channel element and misuse of resources<br>
in case the BS fails to receive the response message within a predetermined time.<br>
The reservation duration can be set considering the time required for transmission<br>
of the forward common channel message, the time required to process the forward<br>
common channel message in the MS, and the time taken for other related<br>
operations.<br>
In step 803, the PHY notifies the RC of information about CE reservation.<br>
If it is not possible to reserve the channel element, the PHY generates a signal<br>
indicating "reservation unavailable" and the timer value is not set. If the channel<br>
element has been reserved, the PHY generates a reservation complete signal. In<br>
step 804, the RC transmits a response received from the PHY to the L3.<br>
If the L3 receives a signal indicating "reservation unavailable", it<br>
transmits common channel designation request information to the L2 through a<br>
message control status block (MCSB) to receive a response message for a<br>
transmission message or user traffic data from the MS. Upon receipt of the<br>
MCSB with an L3 SDU from the L3, it recognizes the processing method of the<br>
current received message and adds the following fields to a message for<br>
designation of a common channel.<br>
The L2 sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 1 and writes the address of a<br>
common power control channel for reference in the MS and the data rate of a<br>
designated channel in the fields DAM_ADDRESS and RATE_WORD,<br>
respectively. If the L2 adds the action time to the message, it sets USE_TIME<br>
and ACTION^TIME. The action time can be added by the L3.<br>
If there is no common channel designation indication in the MCSB, the<br>
L2 sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 0 and omits the fields DAM_ADDRESS and<br>
RATE_WORD. Either the L2 or the L3 does not add USE_TIME and<br>
ACTION_TIME. This implies that the reverse common channel has the same<br>
characteristics as a conventional reverse common channel.<br>
The thus-constituted message is transmitted to the MS on a forward<br>
common channel in step 805. Setting DESIGNATED_MODE to 1 in the<br>
transmission message implies that the MS should spread the reverse common<br>
channel with a particular long code. The long code may be a code unique to the<br>
MS.<br>
FIG. 8B illustrates a BS operation similar to that shown in FIG. 8A,<br>
except that the L2 reserves the CE. Referring to FIG. 8B, the L3 transmits an<br>
MCSB including a command requesting setting of ACK_REQ along with an SDU<br>
to the L2 in step 810. If the received MCSB includes the command requesting<br>
seeting of ACK_REQ, the L2 transmits Designated_Mode.Request to the RC,<br>
commanding reservation of the CE in step 811. In step 812, the RC checks the<br>
MAC state of the MS and transmits CE_Reserve.Request to the PHY. If the BS<br>
knows the ESN of the MS (e.g., in a suspended state), it designates an ESN-based<br>
long code mask. Otherwise, it designates a schedule R-CCCH long code mask.<br>
In addition, the BS sets an action time for synchronization to a message<br>
transmission time of the MS. The action time can be set using the previous action<br>
time value transmitted through a common channel designation request message or<br>
an (enhanced) access parameter message. In step 813, the PHY notifies the RC of<br>
information about CE reservation. In step 814, the RC transmits information<br>
about whether common channel designation is successful or not to the L2. In the<br>
case of successful common channel designation, the RC informs the LS of a<br>
designated long code mask type. The L2 sets common channel designated-<br>
related fields and adds them to a transmission message in step 806 and transmits<br>
the message on an F-CCCH I step 807.<br>
If the L3 receives a signal indicating "reservation unavailable", it<br>
transmits common channel designation request information to the L2 through a<br>
message control status block (MCSB) to receive a response message for a<br>
transmission message or user traffic data from the MS. Upon receipt of the<br>
MCSB with an L3 SDU from the L3, the L2 recognizes the processing method of<br>
the current received message and adds the following fields to a message for<br>
designation of a common channel.<br>
The L2 sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 1 and writes the address of a<br>
common power control channel for reference in the MS and the data rate of a<br>
designated channel in the fields DAM_ADDRESS and RATE_WORD,<br>
respectively. If the L2 adds the action time to the message, it sets USE_TIME<br>
and ACTION_TIME. The action can be added by the L3.<br>
If there is no common channel designation indication in the MCSB, the<br>
L2 sets DESIGNATED_MODE to 0 and omits the fields DAM_ADDRESS and<br>
RATE_WORD. Either the L2 or the L3 does not add USE_TIME and<br>
ACTION_TIME. This implies that the reverse common channel has the same<br>
characteristics as a conventional reverse common channel.<br>
The thus-constituted message is transmitted to the MS on a forward<br>
common channel in step 805. Setting DESIGNATED_MODE to 1 in the<br>
transmission message implies that the MS should spread the reverse common<br>
channel with a particular long code. The long code may be a code unique to the<br>
MS.<br>
FIG. 9A illustrates a BS operation when the BS receives the response<br>
message for the transmitted forward common channel message or user data traffic<br>
from the MS on the designated reverse common channel according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9A, the BS receives the response message from the MS<br>
on the designated reverse common channel in step 901. If the reverse common<br>
channel has not been designated, the BS has, in effect, received the message on a<br>
conventional access channel.<br>
In step 902, the L3 notifies the RC that the designated duration of the<br>
reverse common channel expires, when the L3 receives the user traffic data or the<br>
response message for the transmitted message that requires a response.<br>
In step 903, the RC notifies the PHY that the reverse common channel<br>
should be released from the designated mode. Then, the PHY demodulates the<br>
designated reverse common channel spread with a unique MS long code, (e.g., an<br>
ESN) and releases the reservation of the channel element.<br>
In step 904, the PHY notifies the RC that the reservation of the channel<br>
element has been released. Then, the RC notifies the L3 of the release of the<br>
channel element from the reserved state, thereby wholly releasing the reverse<br>
common channel from the designated mode, in step 905.<br>
FIG. 9B illustrates a procedure of releasing the reverse common channel<br>
from a designated mode in the BS LAC layer, unlike the procedure shown in FIG.<br>
9A. In step 910, a message is received on a designated R-CCCH. The L2<br>
processes ACK_REQ of the received message, determines whether the message is<br>
a response for a message requiring DAM, and transmits a DAM release request to<br>
the RC if the message is the response message in step 911. The RC requests<br>
release of the CE in step 912. The PHY releases the CE from the reserved state<br>
and notifies the RC of the result in step 913. The RC notifies the L2 that DAM<br>
has been released in step 914.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a procedure of processing a message including reverse<br>
common channel designation request information from the BS and transmitting a<br>
response message for the received message to the BS in the MS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the MS receives a message from the BS on the<br>
forward common channel in step 1001.<br>
The L2 of the MS recognizes that the received message has a reverse<br>
common channel designation request field and places a designated mode indicator<br>
requesting transmission of the response message on the designated reverse<br>
common channel in a PCSB (PDU Control Status Block) along with an L3 SDU<br>
free of the LAC layer-related fields of the received message to the L3 in step<br>
1002. The L3 transmits the L3 SDU and the MCSB including information<br>
requesting transmission of the response message on the designated reverse<br>
common channel to the L2 in step 1003.<br>
The L2 recognizes that the current received message is to be transmitted<br>
on the designated reverse common channel from an analysis of the MCSB<br>
received with the L3 SDU, does not add MS ID-related fields as shown in Table<br>
3, and transmits an L2 PDU and PCSB to the MAC layer of the MS in step 1004.<br>
Here, the MS ID-related fields are excluded in the L2 PDU and a designated<br>
mode indicator is placed in the PCSB. The MAC layer transmits a signal<br>
requesting the current transmission message to be spread with a unique long code<br>
to the PHY in step 1005.<br>
The PHY spreads the reverse common channel using an ESN mask, a<br>
private long code mask, or a designated long code mask and transmits a response<br>
message or user traffic data on the designated reverse common channel in step<br>
1006. Here, the MS refers to a common power control channel in transmitting the<br>
message to the BS. The ID of the common power control channel can be detected<br>
from DAM_ADDRESS and the transmission rate of the reverse common channel<br>
is set according to RATE_WORD in the message received from the BS. If the<br>
message received from the BS designates an action time, the MS transmits the<br>
response message or the user traffic data to the BS at the designated action time.<br>
On the other hand, if the system sets the action time of the CE to a particular<br>
value, the MS does not know the action time and thus transmits the message at an<br>
arbitrary time.<br>
Therefore, a reverse common channel signal is spread with an MS unique<br>
long code or a particular spreading code designated by the BS prior to<br>
transmission. Consequently, the designated reverse common channel serves<br>
similarly as a dedicated channel.<br>
Designation of a common" channel in the MS and BS will now be<br>
described according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a BS transmission procedure for designation of a<br>
common channel according to a third preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The L3 generates an L3 SDU and transmits the L3 SDU and an MCSB<br>
indicating that the generated message can request designation of a common<br>
channel to the L2 in step 1100. The L2 determines whether the received L3 SDU<br>
request designation of a common channel by processing the MCSB, generates an<br>
L2 PDU by adding L2-generated fields to the L3 SDU, and transmits the L2 SDU<br>
and a PCSB indicating that the message requests common channel designation to<br>
the MAC layer in step 1101. Here, the L2 sets the field ACK_REQ of the<br>
message to 1 to indicate this message requires a response from the MS.<br>
If the MAC layer finds out that the current message is a common channel<br>
designation request message by interpreting the PCSB, it transmits<br>
Designated_mode.Request command to the RC to reserve a CE of the PHY in<br>
step 1102. The RC transmits CE_Reserve.Request with action time to the PHY in<br>
step 1103. The action time can be promised between the BS and the MS or set by<br>
the BS and then notified of to the MS through a message. A long code mask type<br>
is also transmitted to the MS for use in common channel designation. The PHY<br>
transmits information about the reserved state of the CE to the RC in step 1104.<br>
The RC notifies the MAC layer whether the CE of the PHY has been<br>
successfully reserved and of a long code mask to be used during common channel<br>
designation in the MS in step 1105. After the MAC layer confirms that the CE<br>
has been successfully reserved, it constructs fields (i.e., DESIGNATED_MODE,<br>
DAM_ADDRESS, and RATE_WORD) necessary for common channel<br>
designation, and adds them to the L2 PDU in step 1106. In step 1107, the BS<br>
transmits the message including the common channel designation information to<br>
the MS on the F-CCCH.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a BS reception procedure for common channel<br>
designation, according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the BS receives a response message for its<br>
transmitted message on a designated R-CCCH in step 1201. The MAC layer<br>
confirms that the current received message has been received on the designated<br>
common channel, constructs an L2 PDU and a PCSB, and transmits them to the<br>
L2 in step 1202. Also in step 1202, the MAC layer transmits<br>
Designated_Mode_Release.Request to the RC, requesting release of the common<br>
channel from a designated mode. The RC transmits CE_Release.Request to the<br>
PHY, requesting release of the CE from the reserved state, thereby releasing all<br>
the resources designated for designation of the common channel, in step 1205.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates a reverse common channel processing procedure for<br>
common channel designation in the MS, according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The MAC layer of the MS receives a message from the BS and<br>
determines whether the received message is a common channel designation<br>
request message in step 1300.<br>
After the MAC layer confirms that the received message is a common<br>
channel designation request message, it requests the PHY that it is changed to a<br>
long code mask to be used for common channel designation in step 1301. Also,<br>
the MAC layer transmits an L2 PDU and a PCSB including common channel<br>
designation request information to the L2. The L2 analyses the PCSB and<br>
transmits an L3 SDU and an MCSB with common channel designation indicating<br>
information to the L3 in step 1302. The L3 transmits the L3 SDU and the MCSB<br>
to the L2 in step 1303. The L2 transmits the L2 PDU and the PCSB to the MAC<br>
layer in step 1304.<br>
The MAC layer constructs a message converted from the L2 PDU and<br>
transmits the message to the PHY in step 1305. The PHY spreads the received<br>
message using the designated long code mask and transmits the spread message<br>
on the R-CCCH in steps 1306. Here, the MS starts the message transmission at<br>
an action time promised with the BS and controls the transmission power of the<br>
message using a common power control channel designated by the BS.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
