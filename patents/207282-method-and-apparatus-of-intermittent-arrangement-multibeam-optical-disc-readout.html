Nationality : Japan<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an optical disc read apparatus and method, and more particularly to an optical disc read apparatus and method in which different light beams are applied at the same time to a plurality of adjacent tracks of an optical disc formed with a spiral track, such CD-ROM, CD-WO, DVD, DVD-ROM, and DVD-RAM, and data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams are read with a record data read system in accordance with a detected output of each reflected light beam.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A multibeam method is one of the methods of reading record data from a CD-ROM at high speed. With this method, different light beams are applied at the same time to a plurality of adjacent tracks of an optical disc formed with a spiral track, data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams are read with a<br><br>
record data read system in accordance with; a detected output of each reflected light beam, and the read data are sequentially output in the record order by preventing the read data from being duplicated or omitted.<br>
A multibeam method of reading an optical disc (CD-ROM) will be described with reference to Fig. 21. Reference numeral 1 represents an optical disc (CD-ROM) as viewed toward a signal plane (from an optical pickup side), CD-ROM being formed with a spiral track recorded with data (the outer and inner circumference sides of CD-ROM are indicated by arrows in Fig. 21). Reference numeral 2 represents an optical pickup capable of radiating five light beams, the optical pickup 2 being provided with a relative rotation to CD-ROM 1 and moved from the inner circumference to outer circumference as record data read advances. As the optical pickup 2 reaches a position I and starts reading record data, light beams 31 to 35 are applied at the same time to respective tracks (x-1) to (x+3) and data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams 31 to 35 are read with a record data read system in accordance with a detected output of each reflected light beam.<br>
Record data of CD-ROM 1 is formed on the basis of one frame unit (one frame = 1/75 sec) represented by A-time (Absolute-time) of a sub-code Q channel, in conformity with the CD signal format.  As the optical<br><br>
pickup 2 starts reading data from the position I shown in Fig. 21, the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time - 23:40:59 or 23 minutes, 40 seconds, 59 frames, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:40:74, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:14, the optical beam 34 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:29, and the optical beam 35 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:44.<br>
As CD-ROM 1 rotates generally once (slightly more than once) and the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches a position II shown in Fig. 21 (the light beams 31 to 35 are applied to the tracks x to (x+4), the optical beam 31 correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:40:73, the optical beam 32 correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:41:13, the optical beam 33 correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time - 23:41:28, and the optical beam 34 correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:41:43. In this manner, there is no omission of read data by the optical beams 3^ to 35 (at this time, the light beam 35 has correctly read record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:41:58). The data read by the optical beams 31 to 35 are output to external circuits in the record order by preventing the read data from being<br><br>
duplicated.<br>
When the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches the position II shown in Fig. 21, the optical pickup 2 is jumped forward (toward the outer circumference of CD-ROM 1) by three tracks. Namely, the optical pickup 2 is jumped to a position III shown in Fig. 21 (and the light beams 31 to 35 are applied to tracks (x+3) to (x+7)). Thereafter, data read starts again. Specifically, the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:46, the optical beam 82 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:61, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:01, the optical beam 35 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:16, and the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:31.<br>
As CD-ROM 1 rotates generally once (slightly more than once) and the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 21 (the light beams 31  to 35 are applied to the tracks (x+4) to (x+8), the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:41:60, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:00, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:15, and the optical beam 3. system correctly reads record<br><br>
data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:30. In this manner, there is no omission of read data by the optical beams 31 to 35 (at this time, the light beam 31 has correctly read record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:45). The data read by the optical beams 31 to 35 are output to the external circuits in the record order by preventing the read data from being duplicated.<br>
When the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches the position IV shown in Fig. 21, the optical pickup 2 is jumped forward (toward the outer circumference of CD-ROM 1) by three tracks. Namely, the optical pickup 2 is jumped to a position V shown in Fig. 21 (and the light beams 31 to 35 applied to tracks (x+7) to (x+11)). Thereafter, data read starts again. Specifically, the optical beam 35 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:33, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:48, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:42:63, the optical beam 34 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:43:03, and the optical beam 35 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:43:18,<br>
As CD-ROM 1 rotates generally once (slightly more than once) and the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 21 (the light beams 31 to 35 are applied to the tracks (x+8) to (x+12).<br><br>
the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:47, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:42:62, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:02, and the optical beam 34 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:17. In this manner, there is no omission of read data by the optical beams 31 to 35 (at this time, the light beam 3^ has correctly read record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:32). The data read by the optical beams 3^ to 85 are output to the external circuits in the record order by preventing the read data from being duplicated.<br>
When the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches the position VI shown in Fig. 21, the optical pickup 2 is jumped forward (toward the outer circumference of CD-ROM 1) by three tracks. Namely, the optical pickup 2 is jumped to a position VII shown in Fig. 21 (and the light beams 31 to 35 are applied to tracks (x+11) to (x+15)). Thereafter, data read starts again. Specifically, the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:43:20, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:43:35, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:43:50, the optical beam 34 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-<br><br>
time = 23:43:65, and the optical beam 35 system correctly reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:44:05.<br>
As CD-ROM 1 rotates generally once (slightly more than once) and the read position with the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VIII shown in Fig. 21 (the light beams 31 to 35 are applied to the tracks (x+12) to (x-i-16), the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:34, the optical beam 32 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:49, the optical beam 33 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:43:64, and the optical beam 31 system correctly reads record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:44:04. In this manner, there is no omission of read data by the optical beams 31 to 35 (at this time, the light beam 35 has correctly read record data up to the frame of A-time = 23:44:19). The data read by the optical beams 31 to 35 are output to the external circuits in the record order by preventing the read data from being duplicated.<br>
While the optical pickup 2 is given a relative rotation to CD-ROM 1 from the position I to the position II, the light beam 35 system reads the record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:44 to the frame of A-time = 23:41:58, whereas while the optical pickup 2 is given a relative rotation to CD-ROM 1 from the position III to the position IV, the light beam 35 system reads the record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:46 to the<br><br>
frame of A-time = 23:41:60. Therefore, record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:46 to the frame of A-time = 23:41:58 is duplicated. Therefore, for the record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:46 to the frame of A-time = 23:41:58, the record data previously read with the light beam 35 is output and the record data read with the light beam 31 is discarded.<br>
When the track jump is performed from the position 11 shown in Fig. 21, the optical pickup 2 is jumped not by four tracks, but by three tracks in order to apply the light beam 31 to the track (x+3) from which the record data was read with the light beam 35 system immediately before the track jump. If the number of jump tracks is "4", the optical pickup 2 is jumped to a position III' shown in Fig. 21, and thereafter the light beam 31 system reads record data from the frame of A-time = 23:41:61. Therefore, the record data in the frames of A-time = 23:41:59 and A-time = 23:41:61 still not read with the light beam 35 before the track jump are omitted.<br>
Generally, high speed read of CD-ROM 1 is performed by repeating an operation of reading record data with n (n is an integer "3" or larger) light beam systems for one rotation and then making the optical pickup jump forward by (n-2) tracks.<br>
When a track jump is performed, the focus servo system and tracking servo system are temporarily disturbed so that record data read cannot resume until<br><br>
these servo systems become stable.<br>
With the conventional multibeam optical disc read method described above, if the number n of light beams is "5", it is necessary to perform a continuous read by about four rotations of CD-ROM 1 and three track jumps in order to read record data from the tracks (x-1) to (x+16) shown in Fig. 21. Since a fairly long time is necessary for each track jump, it takes a long time to read data recorded in a number of tracks.<br>
Record data read with some light beam systems may become impossible because of a track pitch variation, surface vibration, center deviation and the like of CD-ROM 1. In such a case, the conventional optical disc read method of repeating an operation of reading record data with n (n is an integer "3" or larger) light beam systems for approximately one rotation and then making the optical pickup jump forward by (n-2) tracks, is associated with some problem. For example, if the light beam 32 system shown in Fig. 21 is unable to read record data, the record data in the frames from A-time = 23:40:74 to A-time = 23:41:13 cannot be read during the record data read with the optical pickup 2 by approximately one rotation from the position I shown in Fig. 21.<br>
As the optical pickup 2 reaches the position II, the track jump by three tracks to the position III is performed.  Therefore, the record data in the frames<br><br>
from A-time = 23:40:74 to: A-time = 23:41:13 cannot be read. Also, the record data in the frames from A-time = 23:41:61 to A-time = 23:42:00 cannot be read during the record data read by approximately one rotation from the position III.<br>
As above, a problem occurs that a user cannot acquire a portion of necessary data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problem and provide an optical disc read method and apparatus capable of reading data at high speed from an optical disc.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an optical disc read method and apparatus capable of acquiring necessary data even if data read with some light beams is impossible.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an optical disc read method and apparatus capable of efficiently reading record data from an optical disc even if data read with some light beams is impossible.<br>
In an optical disc read method according to the invention, data recorded on tracks of an optical disc formed with a spiral track is read with a record data read system by applying different light beams 1, . . ., i,, .. ., n at the same time to n tracks at every (c+l)-th<br><br>
and independently detecting the light beams reflected from the optical disc, where c is an integer of 1 or larger and n is an integer of 2 or larger, and the record data of the optical disc is read by alternately performing an operation of continuously reading the record data on the tracks of the optical disc with n light beam systems and a track jump operation in a forward direction after the continuous reading operation.<br>
The continuous reading operation may be performed during approximately (c+1) rotations of the optical disc, and the track jump operation jumps approximately {(c+1) ' (n-1) -1} tracks in the forward direction.<br>
If there is a light beam system unable to read the record data of the optical disc, among the n light beam systems, the record data of the optical disc may be read by alternately performing an operation of continuously reading the record data on the tracks of the optical disc with n light beam systems during approximately (c+1) rotations and a track jump operation by approximately {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} tracks in a forward direction after the continuous reading operation, by using detection outputs from only M (M 
M is the maximum number of adjacent record data readable light beam systems among record data readable light beam systems.<br><br>
Alternatively, if there is a light beam system unable to read the record data of the optical disc, among the n light beam systems and if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among record data readable light beam systems and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams, the record data of the optical disc may be read by alternately performing an operation of continuously reading the record data on the tracks of the optical disc with the record data readable light beam systems during approximately {(R+1) • (c+1)} and a track jump operation by approximately (Q-1) tracks in a forward direction after the continuous reading operation with a combination of the record data readable light beam systems shows no omission of the record data of the optical disc.<br>
The record data detected from the tracks of the optical disc during the continuous reading operation may be stored together with frame addresses, and the track jump operation may be performed when a frame address corresponding to the record data read with the i-th light beam becomes continuous with a continuous data read start frame address corresponding to the record data to be read with the adjacent (i+l)-th light beam.<br><br>
According to another aspect of the optical disc read method of this invention, data recorded on tracks of an optical disc formed with a spiral track is read with a record data read system by applying different light beams at the same time to n tracks at every (c+1)-th and independently detecting the light beams reflected from the optical disc, where c is an integer of 1 or larger and n is an integer of 2 or larger; a system capable of reading the record data from the optical disc is detected from n light beam systems by applying the light beams to predetermined positions of the tracks of the optical disc at a start of a continuous data reading operation and continuously reading the record data; and each light beam is set so that one of the detected record data readable systems is applied to a read start track frame.<br>
After each light beam is set so that one of the detected record data readable systems is applied to a read start track frame, the record data of the optical disc may be read by alternately performing an operation of continuously reading the record data during a predetermined number of rotations of the optical disc and a track jump operation by a predetermined number of tracks, the rotation number and the track number being determined in accordance with the number and layout of the record data readable systems.<br>
The predetermined positions of the tracks of the<br><br>
optical disc may be positions more in a backward<br>
■•<br>
direction than the read start track frame.<br>
In an optical disc read apparatus embodying the optical disc read method, record data reading means includes a memory for storing the record data obtained during the continuous reading operation and a corresponding frame address, and read control means performs the track jump operation when a frame address corresponding to the record data read with the i-th light beam becomes continuous with a continuous data read start frame address corresponding to the record data to be read with the adjacent (i+l)-th light beam.<br>
According to the invention, since the continuous read of an optical disc is performed approximately during (c+1) rotations, the number of track jumps which take a long process time can be reduced so that record data of the optical disc in a desired area can be read quickly.<br>
Even if the record data cannot be read with some light beam systems because of a track pitch variation, surface vibration, center deviation and the like of an optical disc, desired data of the optical disc can be read reliably and quickly with some or all the remaining record data readable light beam systems by preventing the record data from being omitted.<br>

Reference numeral 9 represents a focus actuator for moving the obj ective lens 8 along a direction perpendicular to the signal plane Al of CD-ROM 1 to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, in order to maintain an in-focus state of the light beam 3i to 35 relative to the signal plane lA irrespective of surface vibrations of CD-ROM 1. Reference numeral 10 represents a tracking actuator for moving the objective lens 8 along a radial direction of the signal plane Al of CD-ROM 1 to follow a center deviation of CD-ROM 1, in order to make each light beam 3^ to 35 correctly trace a corresponding track.

The photodetectors PD1 to PD5 are provided in correspondence with the light beams 31 to 35, and each<br><br>

The light beams 31, 32, 34, and 35 reflected from the signal plane A of CD-ROM 1 pass through the objective lens 8 and collimator lens 7 and are reflected by the beam splitter 6. Thereafter, they pass through an optical system (not shown) including a cylindrical lens, a detector lens and the like and become incident upon the corresponding photodetectors PD1, PD2, PD2, and PD5 • The photodetectors PD1, PD2, PD4, and PD5 output photocurrents I1, I2, I4, and I5 proportional to received light amounts, as detected outputs of the respective light beams 31, 32, 34, and 35. The photodetector PD3 is a four-division photodiode similar to that used for an optical pickup of the ordinary one beam type, and outputs photocurrents I3-A, I3-B, la-C, and I3-D proportional to received light amounts of respective division diodes.<br>
Reference numeral 11 represents a sled motor for moving the optical pickup 2 in the radial direction of CD-ROM 1 during a read or search operation. The sled motor is driven with the servo circuit and moves the optical pickup 2 to a desired position along a forward or reverse direction during the search operation, or gradually moves the optical pickup 2 along the forward direction during the read operation as the read operation of CD-ROM 1 advances.<br>
Reference numeral 20 represents a record data read<br><br>
system which reads at the same time the record data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams 31 to 85, from the light reception outputs of the photodetectors PD1 to PD5 of the optical pickup 2, and serially outputs the read record data in the record order of CD-ROM 1 by preventing the read record data from being duplicated or omitted- In the record data read system 20, current/voltage converters (I/V) 211, 212, 214, and 215 convert the photocurrents I1, I2, I4/ and I5 output from the photodetectors PD1, PD2, PD4, and PD5 into RF voltage signals RF1, RF2, RF4, and RF5 corresponding to the light beams 32, 33, 34, and 35 and output them. Current/voltage converters (I/V) 21 3-A, 213-B, 213-C, and 213-D convert the photocurrents I3-A, I3-B, I3-C, and I3-D output from the photodetector PD3 into voltage values Va, VB, Vc,, and V^ and output them.<br>

■i<br>
signal plane lA, and in accordance with the tracking error signal TE, the tracking actuator 10 is driven to make TE zero and make (on-track) the light beams 31 to 35 trace the corresponding tracks.<br>
Reference numerals 241 to 245 represent waveshape equalizers for increasing the high frequency components of the RF signals RF1 to RF5 to thereby compensate for high frequency attenuation to be caused by the spatial transmission frequency (MTF) characteristics of the light beams 31 to 35 and suppress the generation of inter-code interference. The RF signal RF3 input to the waveshape equalizer 243 or the RF signal RF3 output from the waveshape equalizer 243 is input to the servo circuit 23. The servo circuit 23 activates the focus servo control upon judgement of a timing when the value of the focus error signal FE enters a negative feedback region of the focus servo control during a focus search operation. The servo circuit 23 activates the tracking servo control upon judgement of a timing by using the RF signal RF3 when the light beam 33 enters the negative region of the tracking servo control.<br>

The first signal processing circuits 261 to 26g serially output the demodulated data DATA1 to DATA5 one symbol (8 bits) after another. Upon detection of frame sync, the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 output frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level to a system controller to be described later. These frame sync detection signals FS^ to FS5 are used for judging whether data can be read or not for the respective light beam 31 to 35 systems. A-time data AT3 output from the first signal processing circuit 263 is also input to the system controller. The first signal processing circuit 263 for the RF signal RF3 system includes a CLV control circuit (not shown) for making the frame sync signal be detected at a predetermined time interval. The CLV control circuit performs a CLV control of an unrepresented spindle motor drive circuit to rotate CD-ROM 1 at a constant linear velocity. Reference numeral 30 represents a parallel-to-serial converter (P/S) for receiving in parallel data of one block unit output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 and serially outputting them in the record order by preventing the data from being duplicated or omitted.<br><br>

Reference numerals 311 to 315 represent write controllers provided in correspondence with the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265.   The write<br><br>
controllers 311 to 3I5 control to write the data DATA1 to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 265 in the first or second areas of the memories 32^ to 325, and to write the A-time data AT1 to AT5 in the first or second areas of the memories 321 to 325, together with the start addresses A1s to A5s (or a1g to a5s) and end addresses A1e to Ag5e (or a1e to a5e) indicating the location of the corresponding data DATA^ to DATA5 in the memories 321 to 325.<br>
The contents of memories 32f and 33f (where f = 1 to 5) are shown in Fig. 3. In this example, a write controller 31f controls to write 15 blocks of each set of data DATAf (1) to DATA1 (30) in the first area, and to write 15 blocks of each set of data DATAf (31) to DATAf (60) in the second area. In the first area of the memory 331, the A-time data for each block of the data DATAf (1) to DATAf (30) are written as, for example, frames of 23:40:60 to 23:41:14, together with a start address Afg (1) and an end address Af, (1) to a start address Afg (30) and an end address Af, (30) indicating the location of the corresponding data DATAf (1) to DATAf (30) in the first area of the memory 32f. In the second area of the memory 33f, the A-time data for each block of the data DATAf (31) to DATAf (60) are written as, for example, frames of 23:42:48 to 23:43:02, together with a start address Afg (1) and an end address Af, (1) to a start  address  Afs(30)  and  an  end  address  Afg(30)<br><br>
indicating the location of the corresponding data DATAf(31) to DATAf(60) in the second area of the memory 32f.<br>

With reference to the A-time data and the start addresses A1S TO A5S (or a1s to a5e) and end addresses A15 to Agg (or a^g to agg) stored in the memories 3331 to 335, the read controller 34 reads the data DATA1 to DATA5 stored in the memories 331 to 335 by preventing the data from being duplicated or omitted, and serially outputs the data one symbol after another in the record order (A-time order) of CD-ROM 1. Specific operations of the write controllers 311 to 3I5 and read controller 34 will be later described.<br>
Returning back to Fig. 1, reference numeral 40 represents a second signal processing circuit. The second signal processing circuit 40 receives the data serially output from the P/S converter 30, descrambles the data in the unit of one block, and thereafter demodulates Lch and Rch data in conformity with the CD-DA specification through error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with P parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities). The second signal processing circuit 40 then demodulates the CD-ROM data from the Lch and Rch data by performing sync detection, descrambling, header detection, and error detection/correction with EDC and<br><br>
ECC codes in accordance with the CD-ROM specification, and thereafter outputs the CD-ROM data to an external host computer.<br>
up 2 along the forward or reverse direction of CD-1 to a desired position.  For the read operation.<br>
Reference numeral 50 represents a system controller made of a microcomputer. For the search operation, the system controller 50 operates to supply a search command to the servo circuit 23, and to drive the sled motor 11 for the search operation to thereby move the optical pickup 2 along the forward or reverse direction of CD-ROM<br>
the system controller 50 operates to supply various servo-on commands to the servo circuit 23, and to focus the light beams 31 to 35 upon the signal plane lA of CD-ROM 1 to thereby trace the every (c+l)-th tracks (n = 5). Each time record data is read from each track during a proper number of rotations of two or three or more, the system controller 50 supplies the servo circuit 23 with a track jump command of jumping the optical pickup by a predetermined number of tracks in the forward direction.<br>
At the start of a read operation, the system controller 50 monitors the frame sync detection signals FS;, to FS5 input from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 265, during one rotation of CD-ROM 1, to check whether or not any system of the light beams 31 to 35 cannot read record data because of a track pitch variation, surface vibration, center deviation and the<br><br>
like of CD-ROM 1. If all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 are H and there is no system unable to read record data, the system controller supplies a general read/write command to the P/S converter 30 to thereby read/write data output from the first signal processing circuit 261 to 265 to and from the memories 321 to 325.<br>
If the frame sync detection signal for one or a plurality of light beams is L for a predetermined time (e.g., 1/75 sec or longer) and data cannot be read, light beams 31, 31, 31, . . . to be used for the data read are selected from the light beams 31 to 35, and a specific read/write command including read system information "i, j, k,..." indicating the light beam systems to be used for the data read is supplied to the P/S converter 30 to thereby read/write data DATA1, DATA1, DATA1, ... output from the first signal processing circuit 26i, 26j, 26k, • • . among the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 to and from the memories 321 to 325.<br>
The general read/write command or specific read/write command output from the system controller 50 is input to the read controller 34 of the P/S converter 30 and transferred from the read converter 34 to the write controllers 311 to 3I5. Upon reception of the general read/write command at the start of the data read, the write controllers 311 to 3I5 control to write the data DATA1 to DATA5 output from all the first signal<br><br>
processing circuits 26 to 265, first in the first areas<br>
of the memories 32a to 325. Upon reception of an intercept command from the read controller 34, the read operation is intercepted until a resume command is received, and then the data is written in the second areas. Similarly, when the intercept command is received thereafter, the read operation is intercepted, and when the resume command is received, data is written in the areas not used at the preceding time.<br>
If the write controllers 311 to 315 receive the specific read/write command at the start of the data read, only the write controllers 311, 31j, 31j, • . • indicated by the read system information "i, j, k,..." operate to write the data DATA1, DATAj, DATAj, . . . output from the first signal processing circuits 26, 26j, 26j, ... first in the first areas of the memories 3, 32, 32j, .... Upon reception of the intercept command from the read controller 34, the read operation is intercepted until the resume command is received, and then the data is written in the second areas. Similarly, when the intercept command is received thereafter, the read operation is intercepted, and when the resume command is received, data is written in the areas not used at the preceding read cycle.<br>
After receiving the general read/write command (specific read/write command) from the system controller 50,  the read controller 34 supplies the intercept<br><br>
command to the write controllers 311 to 3I5 (311, 31j, 31k, . . .) and a jump command to the system controller 50, when all A-time data become continuous without omission in the areas among the memories 331 to 335 (33i, 33j, 331,, . . .) where data were written by the write controllers 311 to 315 (31i, 31j, 31k,...) at the present read cycle. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the areas among the memories 331 to 335 (33i, 33j, 33ik, ...) where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read and output record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the areas among the memories 331 to 335 (331, 33j, 33k, • • •) where data were written at the present read cycle.<br>
Thereafter, upon reception of a jump completion notice from the system controller 50, the read controller 34 supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 315 (311, 311, 31k,, ...) • Thereafter, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 315 (311, 31j, 31i,, . . .) and1 the jump command to the system controller 50, when all A-time data become continuous without omission in the areas among the memories 33j to 33g (331, 33j, 33j, • •.) not used at the preceding read cycle. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the areas among the memories 33j to 335 (33i, 33j,<br><br>
33jk,...) not used at the preceding read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read and output record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the A-time corresponding to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the areas among the memories 33j to 325 (32i, 32j, 32k, ...) not used at the preceding read cycle. Similar operations are repeated thereafter.<br>
The operation of the embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 4 to 19. It is herein assumed that CD-ROM 1 rotates at a constant linear velocity under CLV control and the focus servo is turned on, and that different light beams 31 to 35 are applied at the same time to every (c+l)-th tracks (n = 5) of CD-ROM 1.<br>
(1) Judgement of Unreadable System<br>
When an unrepresented host computer designates a read start point of CD-ROM 1 as a frame having A-time, for example, 23:41:0, the system controller 50 determines the position of the track containing the read start A-time frame of CD-ROM 1, the read start point being represented by x (refer to Figs. 4, 6, 8, 10-12, 14-16, and 18). The system controller 50 first supplies the search command to the servo circuit 23 to move the optical pickup 2 so that the light beam 31 reaches the position of the track (x-8).  Thereafter, the system<br><br>
controller 50 supplies a tracking servo-on command and a sled servo-on command to the servo circuit 23 to activate the tracking servo and sled servo. Therefore, the light beams 31 to 35 radiated from the optical pickup 2 are focussed on the tracks (x-8), (x-6), (x-4), (x-2) and X in an track-on state (refer to I in Figs. A, 6, 8, 10-12, 14-16, and 18).<br>
The light beams 31 to Sg reflected by the signal plane lA are received by the photodetectors PD^ to PD5 which output photocurrents I1 to I5. Of these photocurrents, the photocurrents I1, I2, I4, and I5 output from the photodetectors PD1, PDj, PD4, and PD5 are converted into RF signals RF1, RFj, RF4, and RF5 by the current-to-voltage converters 211, 212, 214, and 2I5 which are waveshape equalized by the waveshape equalizers 241, 242, 244, and 245 and input to the first signal processing circuits 26^, 262, 264, and 265. Photocurrents I3-A to I3-D from the photodetector PD3 are converted into voltage values VA to VD by the current-to-voltage converters 2I3-A to 2I3-D and added together by the computation section 22 to generate an RF signal RF3. The RF signal RF3 is waveshape equalized by the waveshape equalizer 243 and input to the first signal processing circuit 263.<br>
The first signal processing circuits 261 to 263 make<br>
the input RF signals RF1 to RF5 be subjected to binarization, clock recovery using PLL circuits, bit demodulation, frame sync detection, EFM demodulation.<br><br>
and sub-code demodulation, and outputs data DATA1 to DATA5 (inclusive of P, Q parities) after the EFM demodulation on the basis of one block unit, together with corresponding A-time data AT1 to AT5 of the sub-code Q channel. The first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 serially output the demodulated data DATA1 to DATA5 one symbol (8 bits) after another. Upon detection of the frame sync signals, the first signal processing circuits 261 to 266 output the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FSg of H level to the system controller 50.<br>
After the light beams 31 to 35 from the optical pickup 2 are focussed onto the tracks (x-8), (x-6), (x-4), (x-2), and x in the on-track state by the search operation, the system controller monitors the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 26g to judge a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system, depending upon whether there is a system taking the L level for a predetermined time (in this example, one block = 1/75 sec or longer) during one rotation of CD* ROM 1.<br>
(2) General Read/write Operation (refer to Figs. 4 and<br>
5).<br>
First, the description will be given for the case wherein record data can be read with all the light beam<br><br>
3 to 35 systems.<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is no record data unreadable system, as the read systems of h light beams, all the five light beams 31 to 35 are allocated. A continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (c + 1) = 2, and a read track jump nximber J is set to J == {(c+1) • (c-l)-l}=7. In accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 5 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig • 4 after the h read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number I and read track jump number J are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by six tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 35 are focussed in the. track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), (x+5), and (x+7)  (refer to III in Fig. 4) .   Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), (x+5), and (x+7) at the same time starts, by using five systems including the photodetector PD1 to<br><br>
first sicnal processing circuit 262, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 262, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, photodetector PD4 to first signal processing circuit 2642,  and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 265. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265, the general read/write command is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the general read/write command via the read controller 34, the write controllers 311 to 3I5 write one block after another the data DATA1 to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 26^ to 265, into the first areas of the memories 321 to 325, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT5 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA5 and the pairs of start addresses Ais to A53 and end addresses A1e to A5e in the memories 321 to 32, into the first areas of the memories 33j to 33j (refer to Fig. 3). In the example shown in Fig. 4, in the first areas of the memories 33i to 335, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:15, 23:41:45, 23:42:00, and 23:42:30 (refer to Fig. 5).<br>
The read controller 34 received the general read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 331 to 335 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame<br><br>
before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 33g is contained in the first area of the memory 334, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 384 is contained in the first area of the memory 333, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 33, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 332 is contained in the first area of the memory 33a.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig, 4, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j to 33j become as shown in Fig. 5 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31, to 3I5 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 33j to 335 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 33j to 335<br><br>
where data DATA1 TO  DATA5 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:42:59 is output. Since the read start point designated by the host computer has the A-time at the frame of 23:41:00, the data is output starting from the frame immediately before the read start point.<br>
The second signal processing circuit 40 receives the data serially output from the P/S converter 30, descrambles the data in the unit of one block, and thereafter demodulates Lch and Rch data in conformity with the CD-DA specification through error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with P parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities). The second signal processing circuit 40 then demodulates the CD-ROM data from the Lch and Rch data by performing sync detection, descrambling, header detection, and error detection/correction with EDC and ECC codes in accordance with the CD-ROM specification, and thereafter outputs the CD-ROM data to an external host computer.<br>
The write controllers 311 to 3I5 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation of the memories 321 to 325 and 331, to 33j. The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a<br><br>
track jump by J = 7 tracks in; the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 4. After the light beams 31 to 35 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+8), (x+10), (x+12), (x+14), and (x+16), reading record data resumes* When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 26^ to 26^, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 3I5, and the write controllers 311 to 315 received the resume command write the data DATA1 to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321 to 325, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT5 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA5 and the pairs of start addresses a1g to a1g and end addresses a1e to a5e in the memories 321 to 325, into the second areas of the memories 33j to 33j (refer to Fig. 3). In the example shown in Fig. 4, in the second areas of the memories 33j to 335, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:42:48, 23:43:03, 23:43:33, 23:43:63, and 23:44:18 (refer to Fig. 5).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is<br><br>
no omission of record data read with eacn reaa sysem or the h = 5 read light beams, by referring to the second areas of the memories 33j to 335 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 33g is contained in the second area of the memory 334, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 33j is contained in the second area of the memory 333, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 332, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 332 is contained in the second area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 4, the contents of the second areas of the memories 33j to 33j become as shown in Fig. 5 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 3I5 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 33j to 335 where data were<br><br>
written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 321 to 325 where data DATA1 to DATA5 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:42:60 to the frame 23:44:47 is output.<br>
The write controllers 31^ to 3I5 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation of the memories 32^^ to 325 and 33j to 335. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 4. After the light beams 331 to 35 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+17), (x+19), (x+21), (x+23), and (x+25), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice via the read controller 34 controls to write the data DATA1, to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 after the track jump, this time into the first areas of the memories 321<br><br>
to 325, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT5 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA5 and the pairs of start addresses A1g to Agg and end addresses A1e to Age in the memories 321 to 325, into the first areas of the memories 33j, to 33j. When all A-time data stored in the first areas of the memories 33j to 335 become continuous without omission, the read controller 34 controls to read and output record data in the A-time order starting from the A-time next to the A-time corresponding to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the first areas of the memories 321 to 325 Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
Reading the tracks (x-1) to (x+17) shown in Fig. 4 requires a continuous read of CD-ROM by about two rotations and one track jump and can be executed at much more higher speed than the case illustrated in Fig. 20.<br>
(3) First Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam system 35, refer to Figs. 6 and 7)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 6 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there is one record<br><br>
data unreadable system of the light beam 35 at the outermost circumference, M = 4 light beams 31 to 34 are allocated as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "4" or a combination of light beams 31 to 35 and M ^ 2. The continuous read rotation number I is set asl= (c + 1) =2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 5.<br>
In accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 3^ at the innermost circumference among the h = 4 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track x containing the read start point of the A-time.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 6 after the h read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number I and read track jump number J are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by six tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 35 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), and (x+5). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), and (x+5) at the same time starts, by using four systems including the photodetector PD1 to<br><br>
first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD2 to first signal processing circuit 262, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD4 to first signal processing circuit 264. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS2 are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 264, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 311 to 3I4 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" write one block after another the data DATA1 to DATA4 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 264, into the first areas of the memories 321 to 324, and writes the A-time data AT^ to AT4 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA4 and the pairs of start addresses A1g to A43 and end addresses A1e to A4e in the memories 321 to 324, into the first areas of the memories 33i to 334. In the example shown in Fig, 6, in the first areas of the memories 33j to 334, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:15, 23:41:45, and 23:42:00 (refer to Fig. 7).<br>
The read controller 34 received the specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 33j to 334 indicated<br><br>
by the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 334 is contained in the first area of the memory 333, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 332, and hat the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 332 is contained in the first area of the memory 33i.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 6, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j, to 33j become as shown in Fig* 7 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31, to 3I4 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 331 to 33j where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 33j1 to 334<br><br>
where data DATA1 to DATA4 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:42:29 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311 to 3I4 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation of the memories 321 to 324 and 33j to 334. The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 5 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 6. After the light beams 31 to 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+6), (x+8), (x+10), and (x+12), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 264, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 3I4, and the write controllers 311 to 3I4 received the resume command write the data DATA1 to DATA4 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 264 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321 to 324, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT4 corresponding to the data DATA1<br><br><br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume conunand, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331 to 334 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 334 is contained in the second area of the memory 333, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 332 and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 332 is contained in the second area of the memory 331. After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 6, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331 to 334 become as shown in Fig. 7 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 2, 3, 4". Therefore, the<br><br>
read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 3I4 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 331 to 334 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 32a to 324 where data DATA3, to DATA4 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:42:30 to the frame 23:43:62 is output.<br>
The write controllers 31a to 3I4 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 6. After the light beams 31 to 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+13), (x+15), (x+17), and (x+19), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSi to FS4 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 264, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller<br><br>
34. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the four beams 31 to 35 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(4) Second Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam system 34 refer to Figs. 8 and 9)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 8 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there is one record data unreadable system of the light beam 34, M = 3 light beams 31 to 33 are allocated as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum niunber of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 3^ to 33 and M &gt; 2. The continuous read rotation number I is set asl= (c + 1) =2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) • (M-1) -1} a= 3. In accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 3;1 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time.<br><br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 8 after the h read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number I and read track jump number J are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by six tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 3^ to 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), and (x+3). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1) and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD2 to first signal processing circuit 262, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3 are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30,<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 311 to 313 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" write one block after another the data DATA1 to DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 262 to 263, into the first areas of the memories 321 to 323, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT3 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses A15 to A3g and end addresses A1e to A3e in the memories 321 to 323, into the first areas of the memories<br><br>
33j tO' 333. In the example shown in Fig. 8, in the first areas of the memories 33i to SSj, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:15, and 23:41:45 (refer to Fig. 9).<br>
The read controller 34 received the specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 33j to 333 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 332, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 332 is contained in the first area of the memory 33a.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 8, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j to 333 become as shown in Fig. 9 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 313 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first<br><br>
areas among the memories 331 to 333 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 33j to 333 where data DATA1 to DATA3 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:74 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311 to 314 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation, and the system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 3 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 8. After the light beams 31 to 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+4), (x+6), and (x+8), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 313, and the write controllers<br><br>
311 to 313 received the resume command write the ;data DATA1 to DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321 to 323, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT3 corresponding to the data DATA1to DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses a^g ^^ ^3s ^^^ end addresses a^^ to a^^ in the memories 32^ to 323, into the second areas of the memories 33j to 333. In the example shown in Fig. 8, in the second areas of the memories 33i to 383, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:41:63, 23:42:18, and 23:42:48 (refer to Fig. 9).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 33j to 333 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 383 is contained in the second area of the memory 332, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 332 to contained in the second area of the memory 33j.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig, 8, the contents of<br><br>
the second areas of the mrmories I<br>
shown in Fig. 9 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems " 1, 2, 3". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 313 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 331 to 333 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 321 to 323 where data DATA1 to DATA3 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:42:00 to the frame 23:43:02 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311 to 313 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 8. After the light beams 31 to 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+9), (x+11), and (x+13), reading record data resumes. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to<br><br>
read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the four beams 31 to 33 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(5) Third Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam systems 3^ and 35, refer to Figs. 10 and 9)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 10 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 34 and 35, M = 3 light beams 31 to 33 are allocated as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 31 to 33 and M &gt; 2. The continuous read rotation number I is set asl= (c + 1) = 2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 3. In accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time.<br><br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 8 after the h read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number I and read track jump number J are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by six tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), and (x+3). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1) and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 262, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3 are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, quite similar to the case shown in Fig. 8, an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately two rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 10) to read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br><br>
(6) Fourth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam systems 31 and 35,   refer to Fig. 11)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 11 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31 and Sg, M = 3 light beams 32 to 35 are allocated as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 32 to 34 and M &gt; 2. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (c + 1) = 2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) * (M-1) - 1} = 3. In accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 32 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 11 after the h = 3 read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number I and read track jump number J are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II shown in Fig. 11 by four<br><br>
tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 32 to 84 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), and (x+3). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1) and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD2 to first signal processing circuit 262, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD4 to first signal processing circuit 264. When all the frame sync detection signals FS2 to FS4 are input from the first signal processing circuits 262 to 264, the specific read/write command including the read system information "2, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 8 (in the case shown in Fig. 11, the write controllers 312 to 314 control to write the data DATA2 to DATA4 and A-time data AT2 to AT4 output from the first signal processing circuit 262 to 264, into the memories 322 to 324 and 332 to 334, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 332 to 334, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 332 to  334 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately two rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by<br><br>
approximately two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 11) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(7) Fifth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 82 and 35,   refer to Figs. 12 and 13)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 12 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are two record data iinreadable systems of the light beams 32 and 35, then only two light beams 33 and 34 are adjacent each other among the remaining three light beams 31 35, and 34. In reading at high speed record data of CD-ROM 1 by repetitively performing continuous record data read by approximately two rotations and track jump, it is necessary to read record data only with adjacent light beams. High speed read is possible even for a combination of read light beams not completely adjacent each other, if continuous record data read of CD-ROM 1 by three or more rotations and track jump by predetermined tracks are repeated.<br>
Specifically, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately {(R+l) * (c+1)} rotations and track jump by (Q-1) track can be<br><br>
repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br>
In the example shown in Figs. 12 and 13, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 34 so that Q = 6. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 31 and 35, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 32. As the h read light beam systems, all the three record data readable light beam systems 31, 33, and 34 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set asI={(R+l)* (c+l)}=4, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q - 1) =5.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 12 after the h = 3 read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number 1=2 and read track jump number J = 5 are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by six tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31, 33, and 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+3), and (x+5).  Then, reading the record data on the<br><br><br><br>
of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 334 indicated by the read system information "1, 3, 4" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 334 is contained in the first area of the memory 333, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = four rotations (in actual, slightly more than four rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 12, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 334 become as shown in Fig. 13 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311, 313, and 314 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 33j, 333, and 334, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 331, 333, and 334, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40.  In this example, the data<br><br>
from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:42:50 is output<br>
The write controllers 311, 313, and 314 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation, and the system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 5 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 12. After the light beams 31, 33 and 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+8), (x+12), and (x+14), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1, FS3, and FS5 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 264, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311, 313, and 314, and the write controllers 311, 313, and 314 received the resume command write the data DATA1, DATA3, and DATA4 output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 264 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321, 323, and 324, and writes the A-time data AT1, AT3, and AT4 corresponding to the data DATA1, DATA3, and DATA4 and the pairs of start addresses a1s, 333, and 343 and end addresses a1e, B.3E  and o.14  in the memories 321<br><br>
323, and 324, into the second areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 33j. In the example shown in Fig. 12, in the second areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 334, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:42:48, 23:43:33, and 23:43:63 (refer to Fig. 13).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 334 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 334 is contained in the second area of the memory 333, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of<br>
the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the<br>
*<br>
memory 33j.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = four rotations (in actual, slightly more than four rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 12, the contents of the second areas of the memories 33j, 333, and 334 become as shown in Fig. 13 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 3, 4". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311, 313, and 314 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50.  With<br><br>
reference to the A-time data and the start and end<br>
•r<br>
addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 33j, 333, and 334 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 321, 323, and 324 where data were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:42:60 to the frame 23:44:62 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311, 313, and 314 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the track jump number J = 5 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 12. Thereafter, reading record data resumes. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 31, 33, and 34 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 19 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+17) shown in Fig. 12, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1  during eight rotations  and one track jump  are<br><br>
required. Therefore, the record data can be read more rapidly than data is read with one light beam from CD-ROM 1 during 19 rotations.<br>
(8) Sixth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams S1, 82, and 34, refer to Fig. 14)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 14 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 32, and 34, then reading record data with adjacent two light beam systems is impossible. However, similar to the case shown in Fig. 12, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately {(R+1) • (c+1)} rotations and track jump by (Q-1) track can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 14, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 33 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 35 so that Q = 4.  In the adjacent record data<br><br>
unreadable light beams between the light beams 31 and 35, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 34. As the h read light beam systems, all the two record data readable light beam systems 31and 35 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = {(R +1) • (c+l)}=4, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q " 1) = 3.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 14 after the h = 2 read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number 1=4 and read track jump number J = 3 are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31, 33, and 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), and (x4-3). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using two systems including the photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 265. When all the frame sync detection signals FS3 and FS5 are input from the first signal processing circuits 263 and 265, the specific read/write command including the read system information "3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 12 (in the case shown in Fig. 14, the write controllers 313 and 315 control to write the data DATA3<br><br>
and DATA5 and A-time data AT3 and AT5 output from the first signal processing circuit 263 and 265, into the memories 323 and 325 and 333 to 335, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 333 and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 333 and 335 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately I = 4 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1 = 4 rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 14) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 16 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+14) shown in Fig. 14, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during eight rotations and one track jump are rec[uired. Therefore, the record data can be read more rapidly than data is read with one light beam from CD-ROM 1 during 16 rotations.<br>
(9) Seventh Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam 34, refer to Fig. 15)<br><br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 15 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there is one record data unreadable system of the light beam 34, then reading record data with adjacent three light beam systems is possible as described in the above case (4) (refer to Fig. 8) • However, if a similar operation to the case shown in Fig. 12 is incorporated, record data can be read more quickly.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 15, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 35 so that Q = 8. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 31 and 35, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is R = 1 because there is only the light beam 34. As the h read light beam systems, all the four record data readable light beam systems 31 to 33, and 35 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set asI={(R+l)' (c+l)}=4, and the read track jump number J is set to J=(Q-l)=3.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 15 after the h = 4 read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number 1=4 and read track jump number J = 3 are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II shown in Fig. 15 by six<br><br>
tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 33, and 3^5are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), and (x+7). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), (x+3), and (x+7) at the same time starts, by using four systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD2 to first signal processing circuit 263, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 265. When all the frame sync detection signals FS3 to FS3, and FS5 are input from the first signal processing circuits 263, to 263 and 265, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 12 (in the case shown in Fig. 15, the write controllers 311 to 313, and 315 control to write the data DATA1 to DATA3, and DATA5 and A-time data AT1 to AT3, and AT5 output from the first signal processin circuit 261 to 263, and 265, into the memories 32^ to 323, and 325 and 331 to 333, and 335, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 331 to 333, and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 331 to 333, and 335 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of<br><br>
reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately I = 4 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1=4 rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 15) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
shown in Fig. 15, only reading the record data of CI 1  during eight rotations and one track jump<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 23 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+21) shown in Fig. 15, only reading the record data of CD-ROM<br>
are required • In contrast, in the case shown in Fig. 8, reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during eight rotations and three track jumps.<br>
(10) Eighth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31, 34, and 35, refer to Figs. 16 and 17)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 16 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 34, and 35, even with the remaining two adjacent light beams 32 and 33, record data can be read by repetitively performing<br><br>
data read of CD-ROM 1 during two rotations and track jump in the forward direction.<br>
Specifically, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately {(R+1) • (c+1)} rotations and track jump by (Q-1) track can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br>
In the example shown in Figs. 16 and 17, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 82 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 83 so that Q = 2. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 82 and 35, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is R = 0 because there is no light beam. As the h read light beam systems, all the two record data readable light beam systems 82 and 35 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I={(R+l)' (c+l)}=2, and the read track jump number J is set toJ=(Q-l)=l.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 16 after the h = 4 read light beam systems are allocated and the continuous read number 1=4 and read<br><br>
track jump number j = 3 are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II shown in Fig. 16 by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 32 and 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) and (x+1). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) and (x+1) at the same time starts, by using two systems including the photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 262, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS2 and FS3 are input from the first signal processing circuits 262 and 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 3I2 and 313 indicated by the read system information "2, 3" write one block after another the data DATA2 and DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 262 and 263, into the first areas of the memories 322 and 323, and writes the A-time data AT2 and AT3 corresponding to the data DATA2 and DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses A2S and A33 and end addresses A2e and A3e in the memories 322 and 323, into the first areas of the memories 332 and 333. In the example shown in Fig. 16, in the first areas of the memories 332 and 333, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60 and 23:41:15 (refer to Fig. 17).<br>
The read controller 34 received the  specific<br><br>
read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 332 and 333 indicated by the read system information "2, 3" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory<br>
33j.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 16, the contents of the first areas of the memories 332 and 333 become as shown in Fig. 17 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 312 and 313 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 332 ^^^ ^^3, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 322 and 323, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:44 is output.<br><br>
The write controllers 312 and 313 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation, and the system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 1 track in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 16, After the light beams 82 and 3^ are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+2) and (x+4), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS2 and FS2 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 262 and 263, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 312 and 313, and the write controllers 3I2 and 313 received the resume command write the data DATA2 and DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 262 and 263 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 322 and 323, and writes the A-time data AT2 and AT3 corresponding to the data DATA2 and DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses a2s and a33 and end addresses a2e and a3e in the memories 322 and 323, into the second areas of the memories 332 and 333 * In the example shown in Fig. 16, in the second areas of the memories 33-, and 33j,, the A-time data is written from<br><br>
the frames of 23:41:32 and 23:41:62 (refer to Fig. 17).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 332 and 333 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 332.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 16, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331, 333, and 334 become as shown in Fig. 17 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "2, 3". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 3I2 and 313 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 332 and 333 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the<br><br>
data stored in the second areas among the memories 322 and 323 where data were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:45 to the frame 23:42:16 Is output.<br>
The write controllers 312 and 313 received the Intercept command Intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the track jump number J = 1 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 16. Thereafter, reading record data resumes. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 32 and 33 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(11) Ninth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31, 32, 35, and 35, refer to Figs. 18 and 19)<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system during one relative rotation of the optical pickup 2 from a position I shown in Fig. 18 relative to CD-ROM 1, shows that there are four record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 32, 35  and 35, record data is omitted if it is read with only one light beam 33 by repetitively performing data read of CD-ROM 1 during two rotations or more and track jump in the<br><br>
forward direction. In this case, record data is continuously read from CD-ROM 1 by using the record data readable one light beam system.<br>
Specifically, as the h read light beam systems, the record data readable light beam 33 is allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as infinite, and the read track jump number J is set to J = 0.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 18 after the h = 1 read light beam system is allocated and the continuous read number I = infinite and read track jump number J = 1 are set, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II shown in Fig. 18 by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 35 is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1). Then, reading the record data on the track (x-1) starts, by using one system of the photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When the frame sync detection signal FS3 is input from the first signal processing circuits 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controller 313 indicated by the read system information "3" writes one block after another the data DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 263, into the first area of the  memory  323,  and  writes  the  A-time  data  AT3<br><br>
corresponding to the data DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses A33 and end addresses A33 in the memory 323, into the first area of the memory 333. In the example shown in Fig. 18,. in the first area of the memory 333, the A-time data is written from the frame of 23:40:60 (refer to Fig. 19). After data is written in the end regions of the first areas of the memories 323 and 333, the start regions of the first areas are automatically reserved for continuing data write.<br>
Since only one piece of the read system information "3" is used, the read controller 34 received the specific read/write command refers to the first areas of the memories 333 indicated by the read system information "3" and used at the present read cycle, and controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas of the memory 323, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40, without issuing the intercept command and track jump command. Therefore, during data read, the optical pickup 2 will not jump (refer to III to VI in Fig. 18), and as CD-ROM 1 rotates, the record data after the track (x-1) can be read with the light beam 33 system without any omission of record data and supplied to the second signal processing circuit 40.<br>
In the above embodiments, different beams 31 to 3n are applied at the same time to every (c+l)-th tracks of<br><br>
CD-ROM 1, where c = 1 and n = 5. The invention is not limited only to the above embodiments, other combinations of c and n may also be used if c is an integer "1" or larger and n is an integer "2" or larger. For example, an optical pickup 2B shown in Fig. 20-1 may apply three light beams 31 to 33 to tracks at every second, or an optical pickup 2C shown in Fig. 20-2 may apply three light beams 31 to 33 to tracks at every third.<br>
With the optical pickup shown in Fig. 20-1, if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, record data of CD-ROM 1 is read by repeating an operation of continuous read of the record data with three light beam systems 31 to 33 during approximately (c+1) = 2 rotations of CD-ROM 1 and track jtimp by {(c+1) • (n-1) - 1} = 3 tracks in the forward direction after it is confirmed that there is no omission of record data read from CD-ROM 1 with a combination of three light beams 31 to 33. Similarly, with the optical pickup shown in Fig. 20-2, if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, record data of CD-ROM 1 is read by repeating an operation of continuous read of the record data with three light beam systems 31 to 35 during approximately (c+1) = 3 rotations of CD-ROM 1 and track jump by {(c+1) • (n-1) - 1} = 5 tracks in the forward direction after it is confirmed that there is no omission of record data read from CD-ROM 1 with a<br><br>
combination of :three light beams 31 to 33.<br>
With the optical pickup shown in Fig. 20-1, if there is a record data unreadable light beam system, e.g., the light beam system 33, M is "2" including the two light beams 31 and 32 where M is the maximum number of adjacent record data readable light beam systems among the remaining light beam systems. The M = 2 light beams systems 31 and 32 are allocated as the read light beam systems. In this case, record data of CD-ROM 1 is read by repeating an operation of continuous read of the record data with the allocated two light beam systems 31 and 32 during approximately (c+1) = 2 rotations of CD-ROM 1 and track jump by {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 1 track in the forward direction after it is confirmed that there is no omission of record data read from CD-ROM 1 with a combination of two light beams 31 and 32.<br>
Similarly, with the optical pickup shown in Fig. 20-2, if there is a record data unreadable light beam system, e.g., the light beam system 33, M is "2" including the two light beams 31 and 32 where M is the maximum number of adjacent record data readable light beam systems among the remaining light beam systems. The M = 2 light beams systems 31 and 32 are allocated as the read light beam systems. In this case, record data of CD-ROM 1 is read by repeating an operation of continuous read of the record data with the allocated two light beam systems 31 and 32 during approximately<br><br>
(c+1) = 3 rotations of CD-ROM 1 and track jump by {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 2 tracks in the forward direction after it is confirmed that there is no omission of record data read from CD-ROM 1 with a combination of two light beams 31  and 32.<br>
In the description of the case (3) (refer to Figs. 6 and 7), the light beam system 35 is unable to read record data and the maximum number M of adjacent record data readable light beam systems is "4" and M ^ 2. Therefore, as the h record data light beams systems, the M = 4 light beams 31 to 34 are allocated, and the continuous read rotation number I is set to I = (c+1) = 2, and the track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) * (M-1) - 1} = 5. Instead, the continuous read rotation number I may be set to I == {(R+1) • (c+1)} = 2 and the track jump number J may be set to J = (Q-1) = 5, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the allocated h = 4 record data readable light beam systems 3^ to 34 and in this case Q = 6, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams among the the allocated h = 4 record data readable light beam systems 3i to 34 and in this case R = 0.<br>
In the description of the case (4) (refer to Figs. 8 and 9), the light beam system 3. is unable to read<br><br>
record data and the maximum number M of adjacent record data readable light beam systems is "3". Therefore, as the h record data light beams systems, the M = 3 light beams 31 to 33 are allocated, and the continuous read rotation number I is set to I = (C+1) = 2, and the track jump number J is set to J = {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 3, Instead, the continuous read rotation number I may be set to I = {(R+1) • (c+1)} = 2 and the track jump number J may be set to J = (Q-1) = 3, where Q is 31 to 33 and in this case Q = 4, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams among the the allocated h record data readable light beam systems 31 to 33 and in this case R = 0.<br>
Similarly, in the cases ((5) or (6), the continuous read rotation number I may be set to I = {(R+1) • (c+1)} = 2 and the track jump number J may be set to J = (Q-1) = 3, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the allocated h = 3 record data readable light beam systems 31 to 33 or 32 to 34 and in this case Q = 4, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams among the<br><br>
the allocated h = 3 record data readable light beam<br>
systems 31 to 33 or 32 to 33 and in this case R = 0.<br>
In the description of the case (10) (refer to Figs. 16 and 17), there are three record data unreadable light beam systems 31, 34, and 35, the continuous read rotation number I is set to I = {(R+1) • (c+1)} = 2 and the track jump number J may be set to J = (Q-1) = 1, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems 32 and 33 and in this case Q = 2, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams among the the allocated record data readable light beam systems and in this case R = 0. Instead, since the maximum number M of adjacent record data readable light beam systems is "2", as the h record data light beams systems, the M = 2 light beams Sj and 33 may be allocated, and the continuous read rotation number I may be set to I = (c+1) = 2, and the track jump number J may be set to J = {(c+1) • (M-1) - 1} = 1.<br>
In the above embodiments, a presence/absence of a record data unreadable light beam system is judged at the track position one track before the read start point designated by the host computer, and in accordance with the judgement result, the h read light beam systems, the continuous read rotation number I, and the track jump<br><br>
number J f are set. Thereafter, the optical head is jumped to the track immediately before the read start point to start reading record data. Instead, a presence/absence of a record data unreadable light beam system may be judged at the track position containing the read start point, or at the lead-in of the innermost circumference of CD-ROM 1.<br>
In the cases (3) to (9) and the case shown in Fig. 20, if it is judged that there is some record data unreadable light beam systems, the system controller 50 selects from the remaining record data readable light beam systems a combination of two or more light beam systems, and allocates the combination as as the h read light beam systems, to thereafter set the continuous read rotation number I and the track jump number J in accordance with predetermined rules. However, the continuous read rotation number R when the continuous read of CD-ROM 1 with a combination of the allocated h read light beam systems is performed until omission of the record data becomes none, can be automatically determined as approximately {(R+1) • (c+1)} where R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams among the the h read light beam systems• Therefore, only the track jump number J may be set. The continuous read rotation number when the continuous read of CD-ROM 1 with a combination of<br><br>
all the n optical light beam systems is performed until omission of the record data becomes none, can also be automatically determined as approximately (c+1).<br>
Also in the above embodiments, although CD-ROM is rotated at a constant linear velocity, it may be rotated at a constant angular velocity (CAV). Other optical discs with a spiral track of the type different from CD-ROM may also be used such as CD-WO, DVD, DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM.<br><br><br>
