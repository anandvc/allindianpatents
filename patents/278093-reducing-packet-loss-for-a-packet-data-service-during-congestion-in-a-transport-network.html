REDUCING PACKET LOSS FOR A PACKET DATA SERVICE DURING CONGESTION IN A TRANSPORT NETWORK<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to telecommunications, and more particularly, to wireless communications.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Wireless communications systems or mobile telecommunication systems typically provide different types of services to different users or subscribers of wii-eless communication devices. The wireless communication devices may be mobile or fixed units and situated within a geographic region across one or more wireless networks. The users or subscribers of wireless units or communication devices, such as mobile stations (MS5) or access terminals or user equipment may constantly move within (and outside) particular wireless networks.<br>
A wireless communications system generally includes one or more base stations (BS5) that can establish wireless communications links with wireless units. Each wireless unit has an active set, which comprises a set of base stations with which it may communicate.<br>
Base stations may also be referred to as node-Bs or access networks. To form the wireless communications link between a wireless unit and a base station, the wireless unit accesses a list of available channels (or carriers) broadcast by the base station.<br>
Wireless services, such as packet data services, especially general packet data services, including general packet data applications are becoming popular among technology savvy consumers. Despite advances in computing and networking, transporting network traffic generally depends upon real-time network performance for many packet data services.<br>
Typically, a data network is deployed to transport network traffic associated with a variety of packet data services, such as voice and video services involving interaction from users. However, an increasing number of packet data services, and other services, impose user demands on the data network usage for transportation of service traffic. These user demands, such as Quality of Service (QOS) requirements, may be expressed in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.<br>
For the purposes of providing such general packet data services, including general packet data applications, in a wireless network (or even in a wireline network), a base station that provides network access support on a Radio Access Network (RAN) is typically connected to other network components via backhaul facilities, such as a Ti line, Ei Hne or Ethernet. A Radio Access Network generally manages radio access resources including a forward link (FL) radio frequency (RF) resource, a reverse link (RL) RF resource and resources of a backhaul transport network. That is, one of the resource bottlenecks that may<br>
 <br>
impfxt service performance includes backhaul resources. For a general packet data service, it includes both the application throughput and service response time.<br>
On a transport network, such as a data transport network, a general packet data service is typically referred to as "Best Effort" traffic due to the absence of any specific end-to-end performance requirements. Although performance of such a service may suffer a gradual degradation with a prolonged packet delay and/or increases in packet loss, a general packet data service may usually be treated with a relatively lower priority than Quality of Service (QOS) desiring services, such as real-time multi-media applications, Therefore, when a backhaul facility becomes congested, the best effort data packets associated with the general packet data service may be delayed or dropped first depending on a specific implementation of a transport component along a packet transmission path. Furthermore, since many general packet data applications may typically involve bursty traffic, the likelihood of the best effort data packets experience a buffer overflow during network congestion is far greater than other types of traffic.<br>
On the other hand, most packet data applications utilize a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite. The TCP protocol has a built-in congestion detection and avoidance mechanism which is triggered by a packet loss indication or an excessive end-to-end packet delay beyond a normally estimated value. When the TCP congestion control mechanism is triggered, the TCP reduces the service rate immediately and exponentially. A recovery process, on the other hand, takes much longer time. As a result, TCP-based data application performance is very sensitive to packet loss during the network congestion periods. Accordingly, when a data transport network is temporarily congested due to traffic burstiness (e.g., data traffic burstiness or higher priority QoS traffic burstiness), network packet loss fi-om the best-effort data traffic and TCP time-out may cause a significant application performance degradation.<br>
Generally, for a transport network including a plurality of transport nodes, the transport network congestion is detected by measuring performance of aggregate traffic, such as a measurement of an aggregate traffic packet loss rate may be detected. This approach has several drawbacks for a QOS system:<br>
1.	With different QoS per-hop-behavior configurations in the transport nodes along the transport path, it is difficult to derive a particular QOS class traffic performance fi-om the aggregate packet loss.<br>
2.	By using only an aggregate traffic performance metric, it is difficult to determine the level of traffic reduction desired in a bursty traffic mix scenario.<br>

While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions may be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but may nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
Generally, a method is provided for reducing packet loss for a packet data service during congestion in the data transport network including an access network, for example, a Radio Access Network (RAN) by controlling congestion of Best Effort (BE) packets. As used herein, in one embodiment, the Best Effort packets may be treated independently, i.e., each packet may be stamped with the addresses of the receiver and the transmitter such that routing decisions may be made on a packet-by-packet basis. Unlike other data service congestion control mechanisms in which congestion in a transport network is detected via aggregate traffic performance measurement, such as aggregate traffic packet loss rate, distributed congestion detection and relief schemes are provided. Only such traffic flows that generate bursty traffic at a specific moment of congestion sense the congestion and thus trigger an associated rate reduction action. Other flows that do not experience the congestion may not be affected. As used herein, in one embodiment, since data flows in general involve a timed delivery, a packet that does not arrive at a target within a time window may be regarded as a packet loss. In one embodiment, a method comprises measuring a packet loss rate over a time period in one or more flows of data traffic packets associated with the packet data service to determine whether the one or more flows of data traffic packets are experiencing a variation in a desired traffic performance level at a particular time duration during the congestion in the time period. The method further comprises triggering a request from a Radio Network Controller (RNC) so that the data may be temporarily buffered during backhaul congestion to reduce a flow rate of at least one of the one or more flows of data traffic packets based on the packet loss rate if the at least one of the one or more flows of data traffic packets experiences the variation in the desired traffic performance level. An apparatus to reduce packet loss for a packet data service during congestion in a data transport network may<br>
 <br>
comprise a detector disposed in a radio access network portion of the data transport network. For example, when the data transport network temporarily experiences congestion due to traffic burstiness (e.g., data traffic burstiness or higher priority Quality of Service (QOS) traffic burstiness), a congestion controller may minimize network packet loss from the Best Effort (BE) data traffic and a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) time-out to substantially avoid a performance degradation of a general packet data application. A customer may control a congestion trigger threshold as well as congestion detection window such that a desired QoS performance of the data transport network may be tailored to match a specific customer service and/or objective. By quickly adapting a bursty data traffic rate, the packet loss during transport network congestion intervals may be minimized, as the flows with data bursts during those periods may be affected. In this way, an end-to-end performance degradation may be kept to a given minimum level. Accordingly, a distributed transport congestion control may provide a relatively fast response and minimize the overall packet loss in the data transport network so that Best Effort data traffic may cope with short- term transport congestion due to traffic burstiness or QOS enforcement. In one embodiment of the present invention, the distributed transport congestion control may reduce packet loss on backhaul because of a higher layer protocols' reaction to the packet loss.<br>
Referting to Figure 1, a communication system 100 is illustrated in which a congestion controller 102a and a traffic rate controller 102b may be distributed in a data transport network 115 to reduce packet loss for a general packet data service 105 and/or a general packet data application 110 during congestion according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. By detecting congestion of Best Effort (BE) packets associated with a data service or a non-real time application, in one embodiment, the congestion controller 102a and the traffic rate controller 102b may reduce an overall packet loss across the Best Effort packets to provide the data service or non-real time application without significantly degrading the service or application performance to an end user. As used herein, in one embodiment, the general packet data service 105 may be a Best Effort data delivery service that guarantees a Quality of Service (QOS) on a packet-by-packet basis.<br>
Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, the data transport network 115 may include an access network, such as a Radio Access Network (RAN) 120 and a backhaul transport network 125. To reduce an overall packet loss across Best Effort packets in one or more flows of data traffic packets 128, at the Radio Access Network 120, a transport receiver 118 may include the congestion contioller 102a that detects congestion in the backhaul transport network 125. Likewise, for controlling congestion of Best Effort packets, a transport transmitter 122 at the backliaul transport network 125 may include the traffic rate controller 102b to reduce a traffic rate in at least one flow of data traffic packets 128.<br>
According to one illustrative embodiment, a service provider 130 coupled to the backhaul transport network 125 may provide the general packet data service 105 and/or the general packet data application 110 to an end user. While the general packet data service 105 may be a packet-based best effort service, examples of the general packet data application 110 include digital media and entertainment<br>
 <br>
applications that may deliver non real time data over the data fransport network 115. As one example, the backhaul transport network 125 of the data transport network 115 may be a wireless backhaul network.<br>
In the communication system 100, a mobile station (MS) 135 associated with an end user may wirelessly communicate with the service provider 130 over the Radio Access Network (RAN) 120 and the backhaul transport network 125 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The Radio Access Network 120 may manage radio access resources including a forward link (PL) 140 radio frequency (RF) resource, a reverse link (RL) 145 RF resource, and resources of the backhaul transport network 125. For example, the backhaul transport network 125 may comprise backhaul facilities, such as a Ti line. El line and/or Ethernet, which may be expensive to provision.<br>
The Radio Access Network 120 may comprise a plurality of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS5) 155 (1-m) coupled to a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 160. To provide network access support on the Radio Access Network 120, each Base Transceiver Station 155 may be coupled to the service provider 130 via the backhaul transport network 125. For the purposes of reducing packet loss during congestion for an end user of the general packet data service 105, the congestion controller 102a may be distributed at the Base Transceiver Station 155 and the Radio Network Controller 160. In this way, a first controller, such as the congestion controller 102a may be distributed across one or more flows of data traffic packets 128 to trigger an indication of congestion relief for controlling congestion of Best Effort (BE) packets. Likewise, a second controller, such as the traffic rate controller 102b may be distributed across the one or more flows of data traffic packets 128 to reduce a traffic rate in at least one of the flows of data traffic packets for controlling congestion of Best Effort (BE) packets.<br>
To detect the congestion in the backhaul transport network 125, the congestion controller 102a, in one illustiative embodiment, may comprise a first detector portion, i.e., a PL traffic backhaul congestion detector 170a disposed in the Base Transceiver Station 155 to detect backhaul congestion in forward link (PL) traffic on the PL 140 to the mobile station 135. The congestion controller 102a may fiarther comprise a second detector portion, i.e., a RL traffic backhaul congestion detector 170b disposed in the Radio Network Controller 160 to detect backhaul congestion in reverse link (RL) traffic on the RL 145 from the mobile station 135 to the Base Transceiver Station 155.<br>
In operation, the PL traffic backhaul congestion detector 170a and the RL fraffic backhaul congestion detector 170b, in one illustrative embodiment, may detect congestion in the backhaul transport network 125 to control congestion of a Best Effort (BE) of data packets flow 128(1) of an end user at the mobile station 135. Thus, when the data transport network 115 experiences congestion due to fraffic burstiness (e.g., data traffic burst 175 or higher priority Quality of Service (QOS) traffic burst 180), the congestion controller 102a may minimize packet loss from the Best Effort (BE) of data packets flow 128(1) to substantially avoid a performance degradation of the general packet data application 110. Additionally, the congestion controller 102a may minimize a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) time¬out to significantly reduce a performance degradation of the general packet data application 110.<br>
 <br>
Consistent with one embodiment, the congestion controller 102a, as shown in Figure 1, may fiirther comprise a FL congestion relief controller 185a disposed in the Base Transceiver Station 155. The FL congestion relief controller 185a may be distiibuted across the one or more BE flows 128 to trigger an indication of congestion relief in traffic on the forward linl
In accordance with one illustrative embodiment, the FL congestion relief controller 185a may comprise a FL evaluator 188a and a FL feedback provider 190a. Likewise, the RL congestion relief controller 185a may comprise a RL evaluator 188b and a RL feedback provider 190b. The FL evaluator 188a may periodically evaluate a packet loss rate of each flow of Best Effort data traffic packets 128 at the transport receiver 118. By using a feedback control loop the FL feedback provider 190a may feedback a desired level of the flow rate reduction to the transport transmitter 122 for the traffic rate controller 102b associated with at least one flows of data traffic packets. The traffic rate controller 102b may be distributed across one or more flows to reduce a traffic rate in at least one flow of data traffic packets.<br>
In operation, the service provider 130 may enable access to the general packet data application 110 and/or the general packet data service 105 by exchanging messages with the mobile station 135 over the data transport network 115. For example, the service provider 130 may enable an integrated data access to a set of digital wireless services for a subscriber over the data transport network 115.<br>
Consistent with one embodiment, the mobile station 135 may transmit messages to the data transport network 115 over the reverse link 145. In the communication system 100, a wireless communication between the Radio Access Network 120 and the mobile station 135 may occur over an air interface via a radio frequency (RF) medium that may use a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol to support multiple users. The forward link 140 may provide messages including traffic packets and signaling messages to the mobile station 135.<br>
The Radio Access Network 120 may provide the wireless connectivity to the mobile station 135 according to any desirable protocol. Examples of such a protocol include a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA, cdma2000) protocol, an Evolved Data Optimized (EVDO, IXEVDO) protocol, a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) protocol, a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) protocol, and the like.<br>
Examples of the mobile station 135 may include a host of wireless communication devices including, but not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDA5), and global positioning<br>
 <br>
systems (GPS) that employ the communication system 100 to operate in the data transport network 115, such as a cellular or mobile data network. Other examples of the mobile station 135 may include smart phones, text messaging devices, and the like. The mobile station 135 may encompass additional features and applications than typically available on a conventional cellular phone. Examples of different features and applications include e-mail service, Internet access, audio-video interfaces for music and media content streaming.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, a stylized representation of a congestion control platform 200 that distributes the congestion detector 102a, the FL and RL congestion relief controllers 185a, 185b in the data transport network 115 shown in Figure 1 is depicted according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Based on the congestion control platform 200, a transport congestion detector 170 may be distributed in a receiving end of the data transport network 115, such as within the Radio Access Network 120 as a plurality of FL/RL transport congestion detectors 170(l-N) across a plurality of Best Effort (BE) data traffic packets flows 128(1-N). Likewise, a congestion relief controller 185 may be distributed as a plurality of FL/RL congestion relief controllers 185(1-1^1) across the plurality of Best Effort data traffic packets flows 128(1-N). In this way, the congestion control platform 200 may enable the plurality of transport congestion detectors 170(1-N) and the plurality of congestion relief controllers 185(1-N) to independently detect congestion in the bacldiaul transport network 125 of the data tiansport network 115 across the plurality of Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1-N).<br>
At the transport transmitter 122, the traffic rate controller 102b may be distributed as a plurality of traffic rate controllers 102b(l-N) across the plurality of Best Effort (BE) data traffic packets flow 128(1-N). A first traffic rate controller 102b(l) may reduce a traffic rate in a first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1) independently from a second traffic rate controller 102b(2) that reduces a traffic rate in a second Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(2). Each Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1-N) may individually detect an indication of backhaul congestion in traffic on the FL 140 and the RL 145. Additionally, each Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1-N) may use a cortesponding congestion relief controller of the plurality of congesfion relief controllers 185(1-N) to trigger an indication of congestion relief for controlling congestion of Best Effort packets.<br>
Turning to Figure 3, consistent with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a stylized representafion for implementing a method of reducing packet loss for the general packet data service 105 during congestion in the data transport network 115 by using the congestion control platform 200 shown in Figure 2 is depicted. According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, to control congestion of the Best Effort packets associated with the general packet data service 105, the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may periodically evaluate a first packet loss stafistic, such as a packet drop or loss rate in the first Best Effort data traffic packets 128(1) within the data transport network 115, as indicated at block 300. By measuring a packet loss rate over a time period in the first Best Effort data traffic packets 128(1) associated with the general packet data service 105, the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may determine whether the first Best Effort data traffic packets<br>
 <br>
flow 128(1) is experiencing a variation in a desired traffic performance level at a particular time duration during the congestion in the time period. To measure the variation in a desired traffic perfonnance level at a particular time duration during the congestion, the FURL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may identify a congestion interval in that particular time duration of the congestion based on a threshold and a window for the first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1).<br>
At a decision block 305, the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may compare the packet loss rate to a triggering threshold associated with a congestion detection widow. If the packet loss rate exceeds the triggering threshold, the FURL ti-affic transport congestion detector 170(1) may indicate the variation in the desired traffic performance level in the first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1). Conversely, the FURL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may continue to periodically evaluate the packet loss rate. In response to a determination that the first Best Effort data traffic packets 128(1) is experiencing such a variation in the desired traffic performance level, however, the first congestion relief controller 185(1) may trigger a request from the Radio Network Controller 160 so that the data may be temporarily buffered during backhaul congestion to reduce a flow rate of the first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1) based on the indicated packet loss rate, as illustrated in block 310. For triggering the request to reduce a flow rate of the first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1), the first congestion relief controller 185(1) may use a non-overlapping packet-based detection or transmission window of a given number of expected packets to opfimize the packet loss rate for alleviating a congestion condition.<br>
In one embodiment, the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may receive the triggering thi-eshold and the detection window from a subscriber of the general packet data service 105. Based on an indication for traffic burstiness and/or a quality of service (QOS) associated with a real-time multimedia service, the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) may obtain a desired service performance level for the general packet data service 105 on the data transport network 115 during the congesfion interval.<br>
At block 315, based on the packet loss rate, the first congestion relief controller 185(1) may determine a desired level of a flow rate reduction for the non-overlapping packet based detection or transmission window at block 310 to cope with the bursty data traffic in the first Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128(1). At block 320, by using a feedback loop control, the first congestion relief controller 185(1) may notify the desired level of the flow rate reduction to the transport transmitter 122 in the data transport network 115 for a next detection or transmission window.<br>
In this way, the transport receiver 118 may enable each individual Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128 to detect the transport congestion individually by measuring a packet loss rate to independently reduce a flow rate to a desired level. For example, each Best Effort data traffic packets flow 128 may periodically evaluate its own packet loss/drop statistics along with the time, and use that packet loss rate as the metric to reduce a traffic rate during congestion. Consistent with one embodiment, by evaluating a reaction to the backhaul congestion, the first congestion relief controller 185(1) may decide on how much<br>
 <br>
the transport transmitter 122 should reduce the traffic rate. By feedbacking a decision to the transport transmitter 122 of the backJiaul transport network 125 to cause the FL/RL traffic transport congestion detector 170(1) to locally throttle the traffic rate. Accordingly, transport congestion detection may be perfomied by an individual BE data traffic packets flow 128 independently by monitoring the packet-level performance. For example, each BE data traffic packets flow 128 may evaluates its own packet loss/drop statistics along with the time, and uses the packet loss rate as the metric to determine whether the transport network experiences congestions<br>
In one embodiment, since the BE data traffic packets flows 128 may involve an in- sequence delivery, an out-of-order packet which does not arrive in a target window may be regarded as a packet loss as well. For example, a packet with excessive delay may also be regarded as a lost packet in the measurement of the packet loss rate. However, the packet loss rate may be optimized to fit a specific network. The following is an exemplary implementation of determining the packet loss rate:<br>
D^D/ X    N_Lost_Pktsi{n-\)K,nK)<br>
rLK{n) =	—	-,<br>
where n is the index of a non-overlapping window of K expected packets. Because the packet inter-arrivals depend on the traffic characteristics and transport performance, use of a packet-based window may be more robust than a time-based window in some embodiments of the present invention.<br>
When the detected packet loss rate of a BE data traffic packets flow 128 exceeds a predefined triggering threshold at a particular given time, it implies that the end-to-end TCP performance may be impacted if no action is taken. This condition thus triggers a flow rate reduction request to alleviate the congestion. Since the triggering threshold may be based on the TCP performance sensitivity over packet loss, such a trigger may be performance-oriented. However, the extent of a flow rate reduction may depend on a current packet loss situation. For example, a dense packet loss may indicate that the data traffic burst 175 is relatively high for the data transport network 115 to handle at the current moment of time or a particular time duration; therefore not only an immediate reduction of traffic flow rate may be desired but the rate reduction ought to be at a relatively higher rate. The following shows an exemplary implementation of the rate reduction in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention:<br>
RR{n) = (1 + a)m&amp;\{PER{n) - Thrfi)<br>
where a is the factor to control the degree of the rate reduction in face of bursty errors and Thr is the target.<br>
Upon determining a desired rate reduction level, the transport receiver 118 may notify the transport transmitter 122 of the data transport network 115 the desired rate reduction for the next transmission window. Since a delay in the backhaul transport network 125 may be less than a delay of an<br>
 <br>
end-to-end application, such as the general packet data application 110, the feedback control loop may react to the congestion relatively faster than the TCP. By quickly reacting to the congestion, the data transport network 115 may avoid a TCP congestion control to execute a response.<br>
Accordingly, by quickly adapting a bursty data traffic rate, the packet loss during transport network congestion intervals may be minimized, as the Best Effort data traffic packets flows 128 with data bursts during those periods may be affected. In this way, an end- to-end performance degradation may be kept to a given minimum level. Since a distributed transport congestion control may provide a relatively fast response and minimize the overall packet loss in the data transport network 115, the Best Effort data traffic packets flows 128 overcome a short-term transport congestion associated with traffic burstiness or QoS enforcement.<br>
In one embodiment, by using of the congestion control platform 200, a high-speed wireless data network may wirelessly communicate mobile data at a speed and coverage desired by individual users or enterprises. According to one embodiment, the high-speed wireless data network may comprise one or more data networks, such as Internet Protocol (IP) network comprising the Internet and a public telephone system (PSTN). The 3rd generation (3G) mobile communication system, namely Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) supports multimedia services according to 3"" Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications. The UMTS also refen'ed as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) includes Core Networks (CN) that are packet switched networks, e.g., IP-based networks. Because of the merging of Internet and mobile applications, the UMTS users can access both telecommunications and Internet resources. To provide an end-to-end service to users, a UMTS network may deploy a UMTS bearer service layered architecture specified by Third Generation Project Partnership (3GPP) standard. The provision of the end-to-end service is conveyed over several networks and realized by the interaction of the protocol layers.<br>
