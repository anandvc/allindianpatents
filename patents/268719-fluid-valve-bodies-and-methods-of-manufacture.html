				<td>FLUID VALVE BODffiS AND IMPROVED METHODS<br>
OF MANUFACTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[1]	This disclosure relates generally to fluid valve bodies and, more particularly, to fluid valve bodies and methods of manufecture to lower the cost thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[2]	Typically, it is necessary to control process fluids in industrial processes, such as aU and gas pipeline distribution systems, chemical processing plants, and sanitary processes such as, for example, food and beverage processes, pharmaceutical processes, cosmetics production processes, etc. Generally, process conditions, such as pressure, temperature, and process fluid characteristics dictate the type of valves and valve components that may be used to implement a fluid control system. Valves typically hove a fluid passageway, including an ioiet and an outlet, which passes through the valve body.<br>
[3]	Various types of structures can be used to make fluid valve bodies, such as castings, forgings or machined solid materials. Typically, the fluid control process determines the types of materials and structures tliat are suitable for valve bodies used in the process. For processes that require sanitary conditions, such as providing clean steam, water for injection, or food and beverage services, castings may not be useable because the porosity of a casting may harbor microorganisms and other contaminants within the valve<br>
along the path of fluid flow. Forgmgs can be utilized for making fluid valve bodies to be used in sanitary fluid control systems, but typically are not economically feasible for producing low quantities of such valve bodies. A solid body or object, such as metal bar stock, may be used to manufacture a valve body for use in a sanitary fluid coritrol system. However, a large amount of material is wasted during machining because tiie solid object must have an initial size large enough to accommodate the largest outer dimension or diameter of the valve body, and final wall Hdcknesses may be small in relation to initial wall thicknesses. Thus, substantial rrwrihi'niTig time is spent removing the excess outer thickness of material relative to the time spent machining die internal surfaces of the valve body.<br>
[0004J FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an example of a known valve body manu&amp;ctured for use in a sanitary fluid control process. The valve body 100 has been machined from two solid objects (e.g., metal bar stock) to provide valve body pieces 105 and 107. A first end 110 of the piece 105 has been machined to form a flange 112 for connection to another part (e.g., a pipe) of a process fluid control system. The flange 112 has an outer diameter A, which is achieved by machining an initially larger outer diameter of the solid object firom which the body 100 is formed. The first end 110 has an ixmer diameter B, which requires that a large amount of the material of the solid object be machined away or removed. Similarly, a port 120 of the valve body 100 requires the removal of a substantial ampimt of material to enable the port 120, having a diameter C, to meet the required fluid flow characteristics of the valve body 100. A second end 130 of the piece 105 has been machined to mclude a flange 132 having an outer diameter D, an mner diameter E, and an enlarged area having a diameter F adjacent the port 120. Again, considerable material of the soUd object used to forai tiie piece 105 must be machined away (i.e., turned into scrap material) to form the inner diameters E and F.<br>
10005] A separate solid object (e.g., a piece of bar stock) has been used to provide tiie lateral or side piece 107, which has an open end 142. The end 142 of the side piece 107 has been machined to include a flange 144 having an outer diameter G and an inner diameter H extending laterally to tiie inner diameter B of the end 110. Again, considerable material of the solid object used to form the valve body piece 107 must be machined away to form the outer diameter G and the inner diameter H of the end 142. After the side piece 107 has been machined, it is peimanently coupled or joined via a weld 115 to the piece 105 at a side portion 117 of tiie valve body 100 using any one or combination of known techniques, such as gas tungsten arc welding, shielded metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, flux cored arc weldings gas metal arc welding, electro-gas arc welding, plasma arc welding, and/or atomic hydrogen welding.<br>
[0006] As can be seen readily from the known valve body 100, the initial dimensions or diameters of the solid objects used to form the pieces 105 and 107 have to be large enough so that the diameters and contours of the pieces 105 and 107 can be formed, resulting in a considerable amount of macliining time, a large amount of material scrap, and corresponding increased labor costs, all of which contribute to make the valve body 100 relatively expensive to mamifachire.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0007] In accordance with one example, a method of making a fluid valve body comprises obtaining a length of pipe and forming first and second ends of the lengdi of pipe so that the first end is configured as an opening and the second end is configured to couple to a second member of the fluid valve body. Additionally, the second end of the pipe is coiq)Ied to the second member to form at least a portion of the fluid valve body.<br>
[0008] In accordance with another example, a fluid valve body comprises a length of pipe having a first end configured as an open end and a second end coupled to a second member of the fluid valve body. The second end of the pipe and the second member are coupled together to form at least a portion of the fluid valve body.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[9]	FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a known fluid valve body.<br>
[10]	FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of an example fluid valve body.<br>
[11]	FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an alternative example fluid valve body.<br>
[12]	FIG. 4 is a representative flow diagram of an exany)le process that may be used to manufacture the example fluid valve bodies disclosed herein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[13]	In general, the example fluid valve bodies described herein include valve bodies througli which fluid may flow between ends of the valve bodies and through one or more fluid passages or ports of the valve bodies. Typically, known flmd valve bodies for sanitary fluid flow applications are manufactured from solid objects such as, for example, pieces of metal bar stock. Such pieces of bar stock must have initial outer dimensions or diameters of sufficient size to form Uie desh^d contours of tiie fluid valve body when machining of the pieces is complete. The machining process typically requires the removal of large amounts of metal, which becomes scrap in the manufacturing process. Additionally, substantial machining time is required in manu&amp;cture of such a fluid valve body and results in significant labor cost or e?qpense.<br>
[14]	The use of a casting process to form a valve body can significantly reduce the amount of scrap material and manu&amp;cturing time. However, a casting is not suitable for use as a sanitary valve body because the porosity of the casting may result in the harboring of microorganisms or other contaminants. Further, while forgings can be used to manufacture fluid valve bodies for use in sanitary applications, forgings are relatively expensive and are not economically feasible for low volume production of fluid valve bodies.<br>
[15]	FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of an example fluid valve body 200. As shown in FIG. 2, tl:e example valve body 200 includes a first piece or member 210 that has been macliined from a selected and/or cut length of pipe. The first piece or member 210 has been machined to form an end 211 having<br>
an opening 212 and a flange 214 for coupling with another part of a fluid control system. The flange 214 has an outer diameter I and the opening 212 has an inner diameter J. As can be appreciated from FIG. 2, ihe use of a piece of pipe to form the first piece or member 210 requires less machining and, thus, less scrap material than machining a similar piece from a solid object or piece of metal bar stock (e.g., as is the case for the piece 105 of the known valve body 1 GO shown in FIG. 1).<br>
[0016] An opposite or second end 216 of fte first member or piece (e.g., piece of pipe) 210 is configured to couple to a second piece or member 220 of the example valve body 200. The second end 216 of the member 210 may be configured to the desired shape by any suitable machining (e.g., cutting) and/or drilling operadon. The second member 220 has been machin;^ from a solid object (e.g., piece of metal bar stock) and has an end 222 that iacludes a flange 224 having an outer diameter K. The end 222 includes an opening 226 having a diameter L, which extends to an enlarged area 228 having a diameter M. Another or second end 230 of the second member 220 is configured (e.g., machined) to engage or couple to the second end 216 of the first member (e.g., pipe) 210, and includes a contoured or cut-away portion 232 to engage or couple to a portion of the second end 216 of the first member (eig., pipe) 210. Adjacent the second end 230 is a port 240 having a diameter N configured to control tlie flow of fluid through the port 240. The second end 216 of the piece or member 210 and the second end 230 of the second member 220 are coupled or joined togetlierby any joining techniques that effect a permanent and leak-proof bond. When manufactured from metal objects, the example coupling or joining techniques may include gas tungsten arc welding, shielded metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, fixa cored arc welding, gas metal arc welding, electro-gas arc welding, plasma arc welding, and atomic hydrogen welding. In the example valve body 200, a full penetration bond or weld 236 can be formed between the first member 210 and the second member 220.<br>
[0017] Generally, an example fluid valve body may be manufectured £x&gt;m two or more pieces of material such as a pipe and bar stock material. In the example valve body 200 of FIG. 2, the body 200 includes a third piece or member 250 that may be formed by machining a solid object or metal bar stock material. The third member 250 includes an end 252 having a flange 254 with an outer diameter 0 and an inner diameter P. The end 252 includes an opening 256 having the diameter P. Altemativeiy, the third member 250 may be a prefomed piece for which the end 252 is formed to a final configuration prior to the assembly of the third member 250 to the example fluid valve body 200. A second end 258 of the third member 250 is configured to engage at least one of the second ends 216 and 230 of the first member 210 and the second member 220, respectively. The third member 250 is coupled or joined to the valve body 200 by any of the coupling or joining techniques described above to achieve a perfnanent and leak-proof bond and, in this example, can be joined by a full penetration bond or weld 259. In the example valve body 200 illustrated in FIG. 2, tlie bond or weld 259 joins the third member 250 to both the first member 210 and the second member 220.<br>
However, depending on design requirements, the third member 250 can be joined to just one of first member 210 and the second member 220.<br>
[0018] The example fluid valve body 200 of FIG. 2 is the result of a method of manufacturing that reduces the amount of machining time required to make a valve body. The first member 210 can be made from a piece of metal pipe that is pre-selected to have an appropriate length and inner and outer diameters that require less machining time as compared to the machining time required for a solid metal object or bar stock material By utilizing a piece of pipe 210 to form the first member 210 of the valve body 200, a significant amount of machining time and a corre^onding amotmt of scrap material and lost time are eliminated firom the manufacturing process. Tbe known fluid valve body 100 of FIG. 1 ^^rically requires about four hours of machining time to make the pieces 105 and 107. In contrast, the machining time required to fabricate the first member 210, the second member 220, and the third member 250 of FIG. 2 is about two and a half hours. Further, the known valve body 100 of HG. 1 is made fiom initial bar stock pieces weighing about one hundred pounds, and the illustrated finished valve body 100 weighs about twenty-five pounds, resulting in about seventy-five pounds of scrap material. In the example of FIG. 2, using a pipe pre-selected to have an appropriate length and inner and outer diameters to form the first member 210 results m less material cost because significantly less scrap material is generated during the manufacturing process. Although additional welding time is required to couple tlie first member 210 to the second member 220, the manufacture of tlie example valve body 200 can cost less to manufacture as<br>
compared to a valve body manufactured firom solid metal objects such as bar stock. Generally, a low carbon stainless steel alloy, which has a high corrosion resistance, may be utilized m the manu&amp;cture of fluid valve bodies for sanitary fluid flow applications.<br>
[19]	FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an alternative example fluid valve body 300. As shown in FIG. 3, the example valve body 300 includes the previously illustrated first member 210, which is machined j&amp;om an initial piece of metal pipe. In this example, the second end 216 of the first member or piece of pipe 210 is configured (e.g., via machining and/or drilling) to be coupled to a second member 320 of the valve body 300. The second member 320 includes a first part 322 and a second part 344 made from solid objects or pieces of metal bar stock machined to provide the contours of parts 322 and 344. The first part 322 has an outer dimension or diameter S and the second part 344 has an outer dimension or diameter U. As can be readily seen in FIG. 3, the outer dunension S of the first part 322 is significantly smaller than the outer dimension U of the second part 344. By fabricating the first part 322 from a separate, smaller diameter solid object or piece, significant reductions can be achieved in the cost of the solid object, the amount of machining time required to form the second part 344, and the amount of material machined away, which becomes scrap in the manufacturing process.<br>
[20]	The first part 322 includes a first end 324 configured by machining to engage or couple to a first end 334 of the second part 344. The first end 324 has an opening 326 that includes an enlarged area 328 having a<br>
diameter R. A second open end 330 of the first part 322 is configured by machining to include a flange 332 having an outer diameter S and an inner diameter T. The first end 334 of the second part 344 includes an opening 336 having a diameter R to form part of an enlarged area 338. The opening 336 communicates fluidly with the correspondingly shaped opening 326 at the first end 324 of the first part 322. The second part 344 includes a second end 342 configured by machining to engage or couple to the second end 216 of the first member 210. The second part 344 includes a contoured or cut-away portion 346 configured to couple or engage a portion of the second end 216 of the first member 210. Adjacent the second end 342 of the second part 344 is a port 340 having a diameter Q for controllmg the flow of fiuid througjh the port 340. The first end 334 of second part 344 and the first end 324 of the first part 322 are coupled or joined together by any of the above-described example joining tecliniques to achieve a permanent and leak-proof bond, such as a weld 353.<br>
10021] The example valve body 300 also includes the previously illustrated third piece or membs' 250 formed by machining a solid object or metal bar stock material The third member 250 includes the end 252 ha.ving a flange 254, an opening 256, and the second end 258 configured to engage or couple to at least one of the second end 216 of the first member 210 or the second end 342 of the second part 344. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the second end 258 engages both the second end 216 of the first member 210 and the second end 342 of the second part 344. The third member 250 is coupled or joined to the second ends 216 and 342 at the bond or weld 358 by any of tiie<br>
coupling or joining techniques described above to achieve a permanent and leak-proof bond,<br>
(22]	FIG. 4 is example flow chart representative of methods for manufacturing example fluid valve bodies. More particulariy, FIG. 4 illustrates example manufacturing methods 400 tiiat may be used to make the example valve bodies described herein. Initially, a pipe is selected (block 402) according to the desired inner and outer diameters (e.g., of Ihe first member or piece 210) and then, if not pre-selected to a desired length, is cut to the desired length (block 404). As described in connection v/ith the example valve bodies of FIGS. 2 and 3, the length of pipe is machined to form an end with an opening (c.g. the end 211 having the opening 212 of FIGS. 2 and 3). However, the end and opening may be only partially machined or rough cut (block 406) and the final machining may be completed later. By completing the final machining of the end and opening of th« pipe at a later time in the manufacturing process, time and e^qpetise can be saved by not having fiiUy machined a piece tiiat, for a variety of reasons, mi^t be scrapped later in the process. Generally, once the final assembly of an example valve body has been successfully completed, final machining of some of the parts of the valve body can be accomplished to decrease the possibility of scrappmg parts that were previously fiiUy machined. Thus, the methods 400 illustrated in FIG. 4 depict both rough cutting operations and final machining operations.<br>
[23]	The other end or second end (e.g., the end 216 of FIGS. 2 and 3) of ^e pipe may optionally be machined (block 408), and in some applications the second end would be completely machined because this end will be joined or coupled to a second member (e.g., the second members 220 and 320 of FIGS. 2 and 3) of the completed valve body. Alternatively, the second end of the pipe may be drilled to form the desired contour (block 410).<br>
[0024] Next, the second member of the example valve body may be manufactured by alternative methodis as illustrated in FIG. 4. Hie material used to form the second member may be selected (block 412), and the material selected may be a solid object or a piece of bar stock made of metal, according to the desired application for the example valve body. The second member is cut to the desired length (block 414), and then machined to form the desiied contours. The machining method can be, alternatively, a machining of one end (e.g., the ends 222 and 330 of FIGS. 2 and 3) of the second member and at least partial machining of a port (e.g., the ports 240 and 340 of FIGS. 2 and 3) and the other end (e.g., the ends 230 and 342 of FIGS. 2 and 3) of the second member (block 416), or a partial machining of both ends of the second member (block 418). Afta: fte desired machining of the second member has been accomplished, the pipe (e.g., the first member or the 210) and second member (e,g., the second members 220 and 320 of FIGS. 2 and 3) are placed in a holding device such as a fixture and coupled or joined together, for example, by welding as described above (block 420). The assembly may be final macliined to achieve the desired finished contours (block 422). Depending on the extent of previous machining of the pipe and/or the second member, either one or botli of the pipe and the second member may require final macliining.<br>
[0025] Blocks 430-438 illustrate an alternative method of manufacturing the second member of an example valve body. Two parts (e.g., the first and second parts 322 and 344 of FIG. 3) are selected (block 430) for forming the second member (e.g,, second member 320 of FIG. 3). The structures selected for the two parts may be solid objects or pieces of bar stock made of metal. The two parts are cut to the desired lengths for the respective parts (block 432). The example methods of FIG. 4 and, in particular for the forming of a two-part second member, include at least the partial machixiing of the ends (e.g., the ends 324 and 330 of FIG. 3) of the first part of the second member (block 434). The second part of the two parts of the second member is at least partially machined or rough cut at both ends (e.g., the ends 334 and 342 of FIG. 3) and to form aport (e.g., the -port 340 of FIG, 3) as part of the second part (block 436). It should be clearly understood that the two pieces or parts of the second member can include a port in either one of the first and second parts or in both parts, and the description of a port m the second part is merely illustrative of the example manufacturing methods and designs described herein. The first and second parts are then placed in a holding device such as a fixture (block 438) and coupled or joined together, for example, by welding as described above, to form the second member. This alternative method of manufacture includes placing the pipe (e.g., the first member or piece 210) and second member (e.g., tlie second member 320 of FK3. 3) in a holding devh e such as a fixture so that the pipe and second member are coupled or joined together (block 420), for example, by welding as described above, and the assembly of the pipe and second member may<br>
then be final machined to achieve the desired finished contours (block 422). Depending on the extent of previous machining of the pipe and/or second member, either one or both of the pipe and second memb» may require final machining.<br>
[0026] As previously disclosed, an example valve body may include a first member or piece made &amp;om pipe, and a second member, and a third member (e.g., the third member 250 of FIGS. 2 and 3) as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. If a third member is needed, a structure (e.g., a solid object or a piece of bar stock made of metal) from which the third member is to be fiibricated is selected (block 440). the third member can be cut to the desired length (block 442), and the ends (e.g., the ends 252 and 258 of FIGS. 2 and 3) are machined to form the desired contours (block 444). Alternatively, the selection process can include the selection of a preformed piece or third member (block 440) that includes a finished portion, such as an end (e.g., the end 252 of FIGS. 2 and 3) with a flange (e.g., the flange 254 of FIGS. 2 and 3), so that machining of tlie finished portion is not required. One end (e.g., the end 258 of FIGS. 2 and 3) of the prefoimed third meniber is machined to form a contour (block 446) to enable the third member to be coupled to or to engage at least one of the pipe and tlie second member. After appropriate machining of tiie third member has been accomplished, the pipe and the second member assembly and the third member are placed in a holding device such as a fixture and coupled or joined together (block 448), for example, by welding as disclosed herein. Generally, machining of the third member can be completed before the tliird member is coupled to tlie pipe and second member assembly.<br>
[27]	Example manufacturing methods are described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in FIG. 4. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that there are other ways to implement the methods of manufacturing fluid valve bodies, such as the use of CNC machinery, manual machining of the parts, and/or varying the order of the operations from the order depicted in FIG. 4.<br>
[28]	Although certain example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, ^s patent covers all methods, apparatus and articles of mamifecture fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br>
