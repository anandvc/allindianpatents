PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to test rigs used for validation of internal combustion engines and more particularly it relates to test rig for validation of engine valve guide seals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Internal combustion engines have valve guide seals for metering lubricating oil for lubrication of valve stem &amp; guide while arresting excess oil from entering into combustion chamber &amp; getting burnt off.<br>
Conventional method of validating valve guide seals comprises of fitment on actual engine and monitoring any change in oil consumption and port/ valve wetting. During actual engine operation, oil metered through valve guide seal for lubrication of valve stem is either sucked inside the combustion chamber &amp; burns or is swept away by exhaust gases. This phenomenon makes it difficult to quantify the rate of oil leakage passed the seal and evaluate the effect of endurance test on seal performance. Hence, validation is also carried out on test rig. Standard test rigs consist of modular cylinder head with arrangement to accommodate valve guides, valve guide seals, valves, valve springs &amp; valve retainers etc. This modular cylinder head is mounted on a chamber which has provision for oil measuring. Valves are actuated using mechanical drives with required frequency &amp; stroke. Oil pressure, temperature, flow rate, boost/ back pressure etc. are maintained as per requirements. After specific test interval, oil collected in the chamber is used for analysis/ approval of seals.<br>
The existing test rig is having limitation like fixed geometry of valve guides, fixed geometry of inlet &amp; exhaust ports, no provision for measuring oil leakage, no provision to apply boost /back pressure, no provision for heating oil, no provision<br>
2<br><br>
for variable speeds etc. Existing rig can not evaluate the effect of endurance test on oil leakage/ metering rate due to modular head, which can not be fitted &amp; tested on actual engine. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this novel test rig is devised.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of engine valve guide seals which can quantify the oil leakage through seals.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of engine valve guide seals on actual cylinder head taking care of all geometrical tolerance variations.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of engine valve guide seals under the effect of various engine operating parameters.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of various seal designs from different suppliers for same engine simultaneously.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of seal performance deterioration.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel test rig and method of testing for validation of seals which is simple and cost effective.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawing wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Referring to figure 1, test rig basically comprises of cylinder head assembly (1), cylinder head cover (8), inlet &amp; exhaust manifolds (10), cylinder block (6)with closed bottom end having provision for oil collection, crank shaft (15), valve train, provision for fitment of weighing paper (11), oil collection unit (12) from closed cylinder block bottom to outside engine, oil sump (19) , oil pump (16), oil measuring tubes (13), prime mover (17), electric heater (18), mounting bracket (14).<br>
Said cylinder head assembly (1) further comprises of valves (3), valve guides (2), valve guide seals (A), valve spring (9), inlet and exhaust ports (4).Said valve train<br>
6<br><br>
further comprises of cam shaft (20), tappet (21), push rod (5) and rocker arm (7) or over head cam shaft with drive unit.<br>
Actual operating engine is converted into test rig by removing pistons and connecting rod. Arrangement is made for collecting oil passed through valve guide oil seals by closing combustion chamber bottom end. Crank shaft (15) is driven by prime mover (17) through variable speed drive. This facilitates running rig on any cycle including over speeding as may be desired. Crank shaft in turn drives cam shaft (20) and valve train units such as tappets (21), push rod (5), rocker arm (7) &amp; valves (3). Intake &amp; exhaust manifolds (10) are blocked with provision of compressed air supply (CI, C2) to simulate boost/ back pressure (PI, P2). Cylinder block (6) bottom end is closed by using blocking plates with a provision of oil collection. Oil collection units (12) are fitted with tap &amp; graduated oil measuring tubes (13). Alternatively, pre-weighed oil absorbing papers (11) can be used in combustion chamber to measure minute oil leakages. Oil sump is fitted with electric heater (18) for maintaining oil temperature (Tl) as per requirement.<br>
When the rig is driven, oil pump circulates the oil throughout the oil circuit. The same is also supplied to rocker arm &amp; valves for lubrication. Use of actual cylinder head has facilitated maintaining exact pressure &amp; level of oil above valve guide as experienced during actual engine operation. Oil seals meter amount of oil, which is necessary for lubrication of valve stem &amp; valve guide. If valve guide seals (A) are leaking, excess oil is collected in combustion chamber or on pre-weighed papers. The amount of oil or change in paper weight is used for analysis of oil seal initial performance or for comparison of various seal designs on same set up simultaneously. As actual cylinder head assembly is used as a part of test rig, the same can be removed &amp; fitted on engine for further endurance test. After endurance test on engine, seal performance is again confirmed on test rig. This helps in estimating seal life.<br>
