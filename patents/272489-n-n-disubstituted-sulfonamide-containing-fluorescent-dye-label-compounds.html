BIOCOMPATIBLEN, N-DISUBSTITUTED SULFONAMEDE-CONTAINING<br>
FLUORESCENT DYE LABELS<br>
RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/713,632, filed on September 2, 2005,<br>
The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Optical imaging is an evolving clinical imaging modality that uses penetrating light rays to create images. Light in the red and near-infrared (NIR) range (600-1200 nm) is used to maximize tissue penetration and minimize absorption from natural biological absorbers such as hemoglobin and water, (Wyatt, Phil Trans, R Soc. London B 352:701-706, 1997; Tromberg, et al,, Phil. Trans, R. Soc. London B 352:661-667,1997),<br>
Besides being non-invasive, optical imaging methods offer a number of advantages over other imaging methods; they provide generally high sensitivity, do not require exposure of test subjects or lab personnel to ionizing radiation, can allow for simultaneous use of multiple, distinguishable probes (important in molecular imaging), and offer high temporal and spatial resolution (important in functional imaging and in vivo microscopy, respectively).<br>
In fluorescence imaging, filtered light or a laser with a defined bandwidth is used as a source of excitation light. The excitation light travels through body tissues. When it encounters a reporter molecule (i.e., contrast agent or imaging probe), the excitation light is absorbed. The reporter molecule then emits light that has<br><br>
detectably different properties ftom the excitation light. The resulting emitted light then can be used to construct an image.<br>
Most optical imaging techniques have relied on the use of organic and inorganic fluorescent molecules as the reporter molecule.<br>
Fluorescent dyes are generally known and used for fluorescence labeling and detection of various biological and non-biological materials by procedures such as fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence immunoassay and flow cytometry. A typical method for labeling such materials with fluorescent dyes is to create a fluorescent complex by means of bonding between suitable groups on the dye molecule and compatible groups on the material to be labeled. In this way, materials such as cells, tissues, amino acids, proteins, antibodies, drugs, hormones, nucleotides, nucleic acids, lipids and polysaccharides and the like may be chemically labeled and detected or quantified, or may be used as fluorescent probes which can bind specifically to target materials and detected by fluorescence detection methods. Brightly fluorescent dyes permit detection or location of the attached materials with great sensitivity.<br>
Certain carbocyanine or polymethine fluorochromes have demonstrated utility as labeling reagents for a variety of biological applications, e.g. U.S. Pat. No, 5,627,027 to Waggoner (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,044 to Brush, et al. (1998); U.S. Pat No. 5,877,310 to Reddington, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No.6,002,003 to Shen, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,536 to Leung et al. (1999); U.S. Pat No. 6,008,373 to Waggoner, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat No. 6,043,025 to Minden, et aL (2000); U.S. Pat No. 6,127,134 to Minden, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat No. 6,130,094 to Waggoner, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat No. 6,133,445 to Waggoner, et al. (2000); also WO 97/40104, WO 99/51702, WO 01/21624, and EP 1 065 250 Al; U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,008 to Caputo et al. and Tetrahedron Letters 41,9185-88 (2000); all of the above incorporated by. reference.<br>

Brooker, "The Theory of the Photographic Process" Mees Ed., Macmillan, New York, (1942), p. 987 and (1966), p. 198; Frances M.

Heseltine, "The Theory of the Photographic Process",4.sup,th edition, James Ed., Macmillan, New York, (1977), chapter 8, "Sensitising and Desensitising Dyes"; S. Daehne, Phot Sci.

For many years, polymethine dyes have been very useful as sensitizers in photography, especially in the red and near infrared regions of the spectrum. However, in more recent years, there has been an upsurge of new uses of these dyes in innovative technological areas, such as laser and electro-optic applications, optical recording media, medical, biological and diagnostic. These new applications of polymethine dyes place high demands on the degree of purity required, and the reproducibility of synthetic methods and purification steps is very important.<br>
To be useful as a label, a fluorochrome has to be provided with a suitable side chain containing a functional group. The method and site of introduction of a side chain containing a functional group into the structure-for the purpose of conjugation, or binding to another molecule such as a biomolecule (BM), represents the innovative step in the inventions concerning the use of the fluorochrome as a labeling reagent An approach in the design of polymethine labeling reagents has been to attach the fimctionalized side aim to one of the heterocyclic moieties (Z1 or Z ), separated by a polymethine linker (PML), of the fluorochrome, of formula (1):<br>
Z^PML-Z2  (1)<br><br>
Another approach in the design of polymethine labeling reagents has been to attach the fanctionalized side arm to one of the heterocyclic moieties (for example Z2), separated by a polymethine linker (PML), of the fhaorochrome, of formula (1 a);<br>
Z2-PML-Z2  (la)<br>

The general synthetic strategy necessary to prepare these labeling reagents is as follows. First, a quateraized nitrogen heterocycle Z1 is prepared. Then, this heterocyclic base is reacted with a polymethine linker (PML) that is an electrophilic reagent such as PhNH»(CH-CH)n-CH=NHPh.HCl or RO-(CH-CH)n-CH(OR)2, where Ph is a phenyl ring and R a methyl or ethyl group, to obtain hemicyanines such as, Z^(CH=CH)n-CH-NHPh or Z3-(CH-CH)n-CH=NAcPh (where Ac is the acetyl radical) or Z^(CH=CH)n-OR. These intermediates are then reacted with a different quaternary nitrogen heterocycle, Z2. The fonctionalized side arm is attached either to the first (Z1) or to the second (Z2) quaternized nitrogen heterocycle. The final result is a non-symmetric polymethine labeling reagent, Z1-PML-Z2, Examples of hernicyanine intermediates are described in F. M. Hamer, "Some Unsymmetrical Pentamethincyanine Dyes and their Tetramethin Intermediates", J. Chem, Soc, 32 (1949) and R. B. Mujumdar, L. A. Ernst, Swati R. Mujumdar, C. J. Lewis, and A. S. Waggoner, "Cyanine Dye Labelling Reagents: Sulfoindocyanine Succinimidyl Esters", Bioconjugate Chemistry, 4,105, (1993).<br>

The methods can also be used to follow therapy for such diseases by imaging molecular events and biological pathways modulated by such therapy, including but not limited to determining efficacy, optimal timing, optimal dosing levels (including for individual patients or test subjects), and synergistic effects of combinations of therapy.<br>
The invention can be used to help a physician or surgeon to identify and characterize areas of disease, such as arthritis, cancers and specifically colon polyps, or vulnerable plaque, to distinguish diseased and normal tissue, such as detecting tumor margins that are difficult to detect using an ordinary operating microscope, e.g., in brain surgery, help dictate a therapeutic or surgical intervention, e.g., by determining whether a lesion is cancerous and should be removed or non-cancerous and left alone, or in surgically staging a disease, e.g„ intraoperative lymph node staging, sentinel lymph node mapping, or assessing intraoperative bleeding.<br>
The methods of the invention can also be used in the detection, characterization and/or determination of the localization of a disease, especially early disease, the severity of a disease or a disease-associated condition, the staging of a disease, and monitoring and guiding various therapeutic interventions, such as surgical procedures, and monitoring drug therapy, including cell based therapies. The methods of the invention can also be used in prognosis of a disease or disease condition, Examples of such disease or disease conditions include inflammation (e.g., inflammation caused by arthritis, for example, rheumatoid arthritis), cancer (e.g., colorectal, ovarian, lung, breast, prostate, cervical, skin, brain, gastrointestinal, mouth, esophageal, bone), cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis and inflammatory conditions of blood vessels, ischemia, stroke, thrombosis), dermatologic disease (e.g., Kaposi's Sarcoma, psoriasis), ophthalmic disease (e.g., macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy), infectious disease (e.g.} bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, including Acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome), immunologic disease (e.g., an autoimmune disorder, lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus), central nervous system disease (e.g&gt;, a neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease), inherited diseases, metabolic diseases, environmental diseases (e.g‹, lead, mercury<br><br>
