				<td>Controllable RF broadband amplifier with a constant<br>
input impedance<br>
The invention relates to the field of controllable radio-frequency amplifiers, in particular controllable gain radio-frequency amplifiers, whose input impedance is independent of the gain. A further aspect of the invention relates to receivers for modulated radio-frequency signals.<br>
Signals  which  have  a  wide  dynamic  range  are processed in radio-frequency amplifiers, such as those used in radio and television receivers, or satellite receivers. Radio-frequency amplifiers of this type are normally used as input amplifiers. In order to allow both weak and strong signals to be processed by the radio-frequency amplifier, it is desirable for the gain level to be adjustable. The signal level can thus be matched to the downstream signal processing stages. When a weak signal is applied to the input amplifier, the amplifier has to operate with high gain while, at the same time, as little interference as possible may be  added  to  the  signal-  Undesirable  interference includes,  for example, noise and distortion. When a strong signal is applied to the input of the amplifier, the amplifier has to operate with less gain, and must not be saturated by the signal. In both modes, good linearity and an input impedance which remains the same over a wide frequency range are desirable.<br>
Amplifiers with a constant input impedance and variable gain are known from the prior art, in which a symmetrical input signal is passed to two or more dif f erenticil amplifiers with different gain factors. The individual differential amplifiers can be connected depending on the desired gain, and have a high input<br><br>
set by means of a low impedance, which is connected between the differential inputs and is very small in comparison to the high input impedances of the differential amplifiers. The input impedances of the amplifiers can thus be ignored. Circuits such as these frequently have an undesirable noise response, and the circuit configuration as a differential amplifier for a symmetrical input signal considerably increases the circuit complexity.<br>
A variable gain for a radio-frequency amplifier can also be achieved by use of a variable control of the operating point of the amplifier in the linear region. However, shifting the operating point of an amplifier can result in changes in the phase response or in the bandwidth.<br>
One object of the invention is now to propose a radio-frequency amplifier with a constant input impedance, a variable gain, high linearity and an improved noise response. One amplifier such as this is described in claim 1. Advantageous refinements of the amplifier according to the invention are specified in the dependent claims. A further object of the invention is to propose a receiver for modulated radio-frequency signals.<br>
The amplifier according to the invention comprises two or more elementary amplifiers which are connected in parallel and are selected as a function of the desired amplification level. The input signal is passed in parallel to all the elementary amplifiers. The input impedance of one elementary amplifier is in this case at the same time used for scaling the input signal. The Individual elementary amplifiers each have essentially<br>
amplifier at the same time results in selection of the input  impedance  which  is  associated  with  this amplifier. Those amplifiers which are not selected as well.  as  the  impedances  associated  with  them  are disconnected from the circuit via switches, such that they do not have any influence on the input impedance of the active circuit part.  The switches  are,  for example, switching diodes, although transistor switches or the like may also be used. It is also possible to use different types of switch in different circuit parts  at  the  same  time.  The  configuration  of  the radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention makes  it  possible  to  select  freely  variable  and reproducible gain steps with little complexity, while at the same time ensuring an input impedance which is essentially independent of the gain. Furthermore, the circuit  is  highly  suitable  for  integration  in  an integrated circuit.<br>
The field of application of the invention is not restricted to the radio, television and satellite receivers mentioned initially. The radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention may be used in all appropriate applications which require constant input impedances and variable gains.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, a receiver is proposed for receiving broadcast radio signals using a radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention. In this case, broadcast radio receivers are receivers for analog or digital audio and/or video transmissions, such as receivers for VHF radio, digital audio broadcast (DAB) or digital television (DVB). Although a receiver according to the invention can be used particularly advantageously for receiving wireless<br>
i_.r cii.siniob , 0,'i.s, trie transmissions.<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, a receiver is proposed   for  receiving   data   signals   using   a radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention. A receiver such as this is used, inter alia, in wireless or  cable  communications  networks.  In  this  case, communications  networks  comprise  both  cable  data networks,  such  as  Local  Area  Networks  (LAN)  or Controller  Area  Networks  (CAN),  and  wireless  data networks,    such    as    the    Universal    Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), the Global System for Mobile  Communication  (GSM)  or  the  Digital  Enhanced Cordless  Telephone  (DECT).  The  data  content,  the frequency range used and the type of modulation are in this case irrelevant. It is thus possible to receive computer data or else speech data, and the circuit arrangement, is not restricted to specific frequency ranges.<br>
The radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of a radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention having two amplification stages;<br>
Figure 2 shows the circuit of the radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention as shown in Figure 1, with a first selected gain level;<br>
Figure 3 shows the radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention as shown in Figure 1, with a second selected gain level.<br>
In the figures, identical reference symbols denote the same or similar elements.<br>
In the schematic illustration of a radio-frequency amplifier  according  to  the  invention  as  shown  in Figure 1,  an input signal,  which is not  shown,  is passed to an input IN. The input IN is connected to a first  and  to  a  second parallel-connected  amplifier branch. The first amplifier branch has a resistor Rl, whose first connection is connected to the input IN, and whose second connection is connected to the emitter electrode of a transistor Tl. A current source Jl which can be switched on via a switch SI is also connected to the emitter electrode of the transistor Tl. The base connection of the transistor Tl  is connected to a switch S2, by means of which the base can be connected either to cjround or to a DC voltage source Ul. The collector of the transistor Tl forms the output of the circuit, and is connected to the output OUT. The second amplifier branch is also connected to the input IN. The second amplifier branch has a resistor R2, whose first connection  is  connected  to  the  input  IN  of  the amplifier. The resistor can be connected to ground via a switch S3 which is connected to a second connection of  the  resistor  R2.  The  first  connection  of  the resistor R2 and the input IN are also connected to a resistor R3 via which the emitter electrode of  a transistor T2 is connected to the input IN. The emitter electrode of the transistor T2 is also connected to a current source J2, which is connected in a switchable manner to ground via a switch S4. The base connection of the transistor T2 is connected via a switch S5 to ground or to a DC voltage source U2.  The collector connection of the transistor T2 is connected to the<br>
collector connection of the transistor 11 and, together with it, forms the output OUT.<br>
The first amplifier branch is activated when the radio-frequency amplifier as shown in Figure 1 is in the configuration shown in Figure 2. For this purpose, the switch SI is closed, and the current source Jl is thus activated. The switch 32 connects the base of the transistor Tl to the DC voltage source Ul. A signal which  is  applied  to  the  input  IN,  but  is  not illustrated, is now passed via the resistor Rl to the emitter connection of the transistor Tl. The current source Jl and the potential Ul at the base of the transistor  Tl  set  the  operating  point  of  the transistor. The signal is passed from the collector connection of the transistor Tl, which is in this mode operated as a common-base circuit, to the output OUT. Since the switch S3 is open, only a first connection of the resistor R2 is connected to the circuit, and it therefore has no effect. The open switch S4 deactivates the current source J2, and the switch S5 connects the base of the transistor T2 to ground potential. Only one connection  of  the  resistor  R3  is  thus  likewise effectively connected to the circuit, and it has no influence on the input impedance of the active circuit. The current source Jl has a high impedance for high frequencies, and the voltage source Ul represents a short circuit for high frequencies. Owing to the low differential resistance of the base/emitter junction of the transistor Tl, the resistor Rl is connected to ground for high  frequencies,  via the base/emitter junction and the voltage source Ul. The input impedance of the circuit is thus essentially governed by Rl, and the signal is passed in its entirety to the emitter of the transistor Tl.<br>
In   the   illustration  of   the  radio-frequency amplifier  according  to  the  invention  as  shown  in Figure 3, the second amplifier branch is activated. For this purpose, the switch S3 is closed, and connects the input IN via the resistor R2 to ground. The input IN is also connected to the resistor R3, which connects the input IN to the emitter connection of the transistor T2. The current source J2 which is connected to the emitter connection of the transistor T2 is activated by the switch S4,  which is now closed. The switch S5 connects the base connection of the transistor T2 to the DC voltage source U2. The switch SI is open, and the switch S2 connects the base connection of the transistor Tl to ground. Only one connection of the resistor Rl, which is likewise connected to the input IN, is thus effectively connected to the circuit, and has no influence on the input impedance. The operating point of the amplifier T2 is set by the DC voltage potential from the DC voltage source U2 at the base connection of the transistor T2 and the current source J2 at the emitter connection of the transistor T2. The input impedance of the amplifier circuit is formed by the resistors R2 and R3 connected in parallel. In this case, as has been described above, the resistor R2 is connected directly to ground, while the resistor R3 is connected to ground via the base/emitter junction of the transistor T2, via the switch S5 and via the DC voltage source U2. The base/emitter junction of the transistor T2 in this case has a very low differential resistance in comparison to the resistance values of the resistors R2 and R3, and is thus negligible. The DC voltage source U2 represents a short circuit to ground for high frequencies, and the current source J2 has a high impedance for high frequencies. The DC voltage source U2 and the current source J2 can thus likewise be ignored. The circuit arrangement of the resistors R2<br>
and R3 results in a part of the signal which is applied to the input IN being tapped off directly to ground, and only a part of the signal being passed via the resistor R3 to the transistor T2. The magnitude of the part of the signal which is passed to the transistor T2 is governed by the ratio of the resistors R2 and R3. The input signal that has been scaled in this way is amplified by the transistor T2 and is produced at the output OUT. The two resistors R2 and R3 can be selected such that the parallel circuit formed by these resistors has the same value as the resistor Rl which governs the input impedance of the circuit when the first amplifier branch is activated. If, by way of example, the input signal is intended to be halved before amplification, the resistors R2 and R3 may each be twice as large as Rl from the description relating to Figure 2 . The input impedance is then calculated as follows :<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The example described further above with reference to Figure 2 to this extent represents a special case of the situation described with reference to Figure 3, in that there is no resistor corresponding to the resistor R2 from Figure 3. In order to obtain an elementary amplifier according to the invention in the general configuration as described in Figure 3, it would thus be necessary to insert a resistor of infinitely high resistance into the circuit such that it, together with the resistor Rl, forms a voltage divider for the signal, and is connected in parallel with the resistor Rl with regard to the calculation of the input impedance.<br>
Owing to the wide range of possible ways of scaling a signal by means of two resistors while at the same time setting an essentially constant input impedance, the circuit can easily be extended by any desired gain factors. One advantageous feature in this case is that only the selected part of the circuit in each case contributes to the amplification and to the input impedance. The simple configuration of the circuit and the use of semiconductor switches particularly advantageously allow the radio-frequency amplifier according to the invention to be integrated in integrated circuits.<br><br><br>
