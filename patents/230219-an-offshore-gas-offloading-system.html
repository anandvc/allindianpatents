				<td>AN OFFSHORE GAS OFFLOADING SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to an offshore gas unloading system. It<br>
also relates to a method of opera :ing an off shore facility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydrocarbons that are in a gaseous state at atmospheric pressure and<br>
room temperature (e.g. 20°C), are often transported as cold hydrocarbons, as<br>
by ship in liquid form such as LNG (liquified natural gas), at atmospheric<br>
pressure and - 160°C. Another form of cold gaseous hydrocarbons that are<br>
ship-transported are hydrates (gar, entrapped in ice). At the ship's destination,<br>
the LNG (or other gas) may be Heated and flowed to an onshore distribution<br>
facility. Proposed prior art offloading stations have included a fixed platform<br>
extending up from the sea floor to a height above the sea surface and with a<br>
regas unit on the platform for heating the LNG. Because of fire dangers in<br>
dealing with LNG, rigid platforms, which minimize flexing points, have previously<br>
been proposed for offloading LNG from a tanker and heating it to gasify it.<br>
The cost of fixed platform is high even at moderate depths, and at<br>
increasing depths (e.g. over 50 meters) the costs of fixed platforms increase<br>
dramatically. In addition, if the platform lies in an open sea it is difficult to moor<br>
a tanker to the platform because the tanker shifts position and heading with<br>
changing winds, waves and currerts. An offshore LNG offloading and regas<br>
station which avoided the use of fixed platforms, and which provided the high<br>
reliability demanded in LNG offloading, heating and storage, would lower the<br>
cost of such stations and allow them to be used in situations where they<br>
previously were uneconomical.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one embc diment of the present invention, a relatively<br>
low-cost system is provided for offloading cold hydrocarbons, and especially<br>
LNG (liquified natural gas), and cransporting the gas to an onshore gas<br>
distribution station. The system includes a floating structure such as a barge at<br>
the sea surface that is moored so it weathervanes. A tanker carrying LNG<br>
attaches itself to the floating structure so they weathervane together. A regas<br><br>
unit which heats the LNG, usually by transferring heat from sea water,<br>
transforms the LNG into gas that can be more easily passed through moderate<br>
cost hoses or pipes and eventually to the onshore distribution station.<br>
A new tanker arrives at the floating structure perhaps every week, and<br>
efforts are made to offload the tanker as fast as possible, perhaps in one day.<br>
To provide a steady flow of gas to the onshore distribution station, much of the<br>
rapidly-offloaded and regassed LNG is stored in an underground (and usually<br>
undersea) cavern. The gas is slowly flowed from the cavern along a seafloor<br>
pipeline to the onshore distribution station, to provide a steady gas supply<br>
without requiring a large gas storace facility at the onshore station.<br>
The regas unit and pumps for pressurizing gas, are preferably electrically<br>
energized for safety and convenience. Electric power on the order of 60<br>
megawatts may be required. Such electrical energy can be obtained from a<br>
power generator apparatus on the floating structure that uses gas from the<br>
tanker for fuel. The regas unit may require electric power only part of the time,<br>
such as one day per week when LNG is being offloaded and regassed. The<br>
rest of the time (e.g. several days per week) electric power from the power<br>
generator apparatus is passed through a seafloor electric power line to an<br>
onshore electric distribution facility. The generation of electric power at the<br>
floating structure is economical because the gas fuel is already available and<br>
because a large amount of expensive land is not required to isolate the power<br>
generation apparatus from onshore homes and businesses for safety.<br>
Electric power instead can be obtained from an onshore electric power<br>
distribution facility. In that case, an electric power line extends from the onshore<br>
facility and along the seafloor and up to the floating structure.<br>
The novel features of the invention are hereinafter set forth with<br>
particularity. The invention will be best understood from the following description<br>
when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an offloading and transfer system 10 that includes a<br>
weathervaning floating structure in the form of a single barge 12 (there could be<br>
more than one barge) that floats at the sea surface 15. The barge receives LNG<br>
through a coupling 17 and a loading arm 11 extending from midship of a tanker 13.<br>
The barge is moored to the seafloor 14 by chains 16 extending from a turret 20<br>
mounted at the bow of the barge. The illustrated chains extend in catenary curves<br>
to the seafloor and along the seafloor to anchors. Preferably, the tanker is moored<br>
to the barge and they weathervane together. This allows the barge and tanker to<br>
move in unison and therefore remain close together in an open sea. A regas unit<br>
22 (for heating LNG to produce gas) and an injection unit 24 for pumping the LNG<br>
or gas to a high pressure, are both located on the barge, and are used for injection<br>
of gas into an underground cavern 30 that lies under the sea. The regas unit<br>
usually transfers heat from seawater to the LNG to change it into gas. A flexible<br><br>
riser 32 (there often can be two or more) extends up from a platform 34 on the<br>
seafloor to the barge. The platform is connected through a pipe 36 to the cavern<br>
30 in which the pressured gas is stored, that results from heating LNG. A pipeline<br>
40 extends primarily along the seafloor to an onshore gas distribution station 42.<br>
The onshore station can be a gas grid that distributes the gas to users, can be a<br>
power plant that distributes the gas to gas turbines, etc..<br>
The flexible riser 32 and connections 50, 52 at its opposite ends, can be<br>
made highly reliable. In addition, reliable shutoff valves are present at 54 on the<br>
platform and on the barge During the past forty years or so, large numbers of<br>
flexible risers have been designed, constructed and used in offshore installations<br>
to produce hydrocarbons (usually including gas and liquid) from undersea<br>
reservoirs. Experience gained from such use has resulted in high reliability. By<br>
using such reliable flexible risers and shutoff valves in the present floating<br>
offloading and injection station, applicant is able to achieve the same high<br>
standards of reliability previously achieved with fixed platforms, but at far lower<br>
cost.<br>
Fig. 1A shows a combination 62 of the tanker 13 and barge 12 held together<br>
to weathervane together about the turret axis 56. Fig. 1B shows another<br>
combination 64 where the tanker moored to the barge by a hawser 60, so they<br>
weathervane together.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an offloading/injection system 70 similar to that of Fig. 1, except<br>
that two risers 72,74 are shown. One riser 72 connects to a pipe 76 that extends<br>
to the cavern 30. The other rise 74 connects directly to a seafloor pipeline 80 that<br>
extends to the onshore station 82. A break is indicated at 83 to indicate that the<br>
pipeline may be long (e.g. over one kilometer). A pressure boosting unit 84 on the<br>
barge 90 can pressurize gas that is pumped through the pipeline 80. Such<br>
pressured gas is directed through valves in the onshore station 82 but the gas does<br>
not have to be pressurized by the onshore station. This keeps the pumps at 84 far<br>
from any inhabited structures on shore.<br>
During regasification of LNG on a vessel and offloading of gas from the<br>
vessel, some of the offloaded gas is injected via riser 72 into the cavern 30 while<br><br>
other gas is transferred through riser 74 to the shore station. When no LNG is<br>
being offloaded, gas is removed from the cavern via the riser 72, Us pressure is<br>
boosted by pressure boosting unit 84, and sent to the shore station via riser 74,<br>
Thus, riser 72 is used bi-direcrionally.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a system 100 in which the barge 102 injects LNG directly into <br>
the cavern through a cryogenic pipeline or flexible pipe 104 that connects to a<br>
conduit 105, In the cavern 106 the LNG gradually changes into its gas phase. Gas<br>
&amp; withdrawn through a separate pipe 112 leading from an upper portion of the<br>
cavern to a seafloor pipeline 110 that extends to an onshore station 114.<br>
In Fig. 4, all gas from The barge passes through a seafloor pipeline 120 to<br>
art onshore station 122 that injets it into a cavern 124 that is directly connected to<br>
the onshore state,<br>
In Fig, 5, cold LNG is pumped from the barge 130 through a cryogenic hose<br>
0r pipeline riser riser 132, and passes through a cryogenic seafloor pipeline 134 directly<br>
into an onshore injector and regas unit 136 that connects through pipe 138 to the<br>
cavern 140, The injector 136 can inject LNG or can regas some or all of the LNG<br>
before injection, depending upon the expected rate of gas withdrawal and the<br>
amount already stored in the cavern. Gas is removed from the cavern through a<br>
separate pipe 142 leading to another onshore station 144,<br>
Fig. 6 illustrate another offloading station 150 for offloading gaseous<br>
hydrocarbons from a tanker 152. The tanker 152 carries the hydrocarbons as LNG<br>
at -165°C and atmospheric pressure. The station includes a direct-attachment<br>
floating structure 154. The direct-attachment floating structure Includes a<br>
buoyancy-adjusting floating system 160 and a propulsion system 162 that allows<br>
the floating structure to lie low in the water, stowly propel itself until its under-tanker<br>
part 164 lies under the tanker, and then debaltast itself (by emptying wafer from<br>
ballast tanks) until its parts 164,156 engage the tanker, Such a structure has been<br>
previously used in offloading crude oil from tankers.<br>
The particular floating structure 154 of Fig. 8 also Includes a regas system<br>
170 that warms the LNG so it becomes gaseous. The floating structure pumps the<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons through a riser 172 into a subsea cavern and/or through a<br><br>
pipeline to a shore station. By regasing LNG, applicant avoid the need to provide<br>
a cryogenic riser which may be very expensive.<br>
Fig. 6 shows that a seafloor base 174 carries a fluid swivel 176. A hawser<br>
180 that extends from a yoke 182 attached to the swivel, extends to the bow 184<br>
of the tanker to moor the tanker so it weathervanes. The structure 154<br>
weathervanes with the tanker.<br>
Energy is required o power me propulsion and ballast systems, as well as<br>
the regas systems. The regas system will use pumped seawater, as to warm an<br>
intermediate liquid that wa ms LNG or even to directly warm the LNG to produce<br>
hydrocarbons in a gaseous state. The hydrocarbons are pumped into a cavern 191<br>
(Fig. 7) and/or a seafloor gas pipeline 190 that extends to an onshore gas facility<br>
192. Where the floating structure lies near shore (e.g. not much more than fifty<br>
kilometers from shore), power can be obtained from a power line 194 shown in Fig.<br>
7. The power line preferably extends parallel to the pipeline. The shore end 196<br>
of the power line can be connected to an on shore electric power facility such as<br>
a utility electric line 200, or to a special shore based power station. The floating<br>
structure shown in Fig. 6 as well as Figs. 1-5, may consume on the order of<br>
magnitude of 60 megawatts (e.g. up to 200 Mw) of electricity when unloading a<br>
tanker. A power line to shore is most practical when the seafloor base lies within<br>
about fifty kilometers (less than 70km) of shore so there are only moderate power<br>
losses along the power line. The power line preferably lies partially on the seafloor.<br>
In most cases the floating struc ure lies at least 50 meters from shore in its greatest<br>
excursion, and the seafloor platform lies at least 50 meters from shore (high tide).<br>
It is also possible to provide a small power plant (e.g. 60 Mw), indicated at<br>
201 in Fig. 7, which uses a small portion (much less than 50%) of the warmed gas<br>
as fuel to continually produce electric power. The power is used perhaps one day<br>
in five or seven primarily to pump sea water in the heat exchanger and to<br>
pressurize gas. During the other 4 days out of 5 or 6 days out of 7, the power is<br>
sent to shore along the power line 194.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a system 210 which includes a floating structure 212 that is<br>
moored through its turret 214 to the seafloor. A riser (one or more risers) 216<br><br>
carries gas to a seafloor reservoir 220 and to a pipeline 222 that extends along the<br>
seafloor to shore. An electric power line 224 that extends primarily along the<br>
seafloor, extends from the turret and over a buoy 226 and along the seafloor 226<br>
to a facility on shore. The floating structure carries a gas-powered generator 230<br>
that generates electricity for energizing a unit 231 for regasing (heating) LNG from<br>
a tanker (not shown) as by pumping sea water through a heat exchanger, and for<br>
pressurizing the gas. When not regasing or pumping, a switch arrangement 232<br>
diverts the generated electric power through line 224 to an onshore facility at P, as<br>
to add to electricity generated by a local electric utility. Electricity can instead be<br>
transferred from a local utility to the power line to power equipment.<br>
In environments that are subject to occasional harsh weather conditions<br>
such as a heavy storm or hurricane, the riser can be constructed to be<br>
disconnected from the floating structure, and laid down on the seafloor or floated<br>
in a submerged position. The floating structure can be disconnected from the riser<br>
and from its mooring system, and can be towed away, to be later reinstalled.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a gas offloading and transfer system for<br>
transferring gas from a tanker (wherein the gas is stored in a liquid-like state such<br>
as LNG) to an undersea or underground cavern and/or to the shore. The system<br>
can be constructed at moderate cost even when it must lie in a sea of considerable<br>
depth. The system includes a floating structure such as a barge, which is moored,<br>
as by catenary chains, to the seafloor. In most cases the floating structure is<br>
moored so it weathervanes, to change direction so as to always face the sea in the<br>
direction of least resistance. A tanker that brings the gas to the barge is moored<br>
to weathervane with the floating structure, so the tanker and floating structure can<br>
remain attached to one another dunng offloading in the open sea. A weathervaning<br>
tanker could not be easily moored to a fixed platform in an open sea. In one<br>
system, the floating structure is a weathervaning barge. In another system, the<br>
floating structure is a direct attachment floating structure that, by itself, may not<br>
have a bow end that turns to always faces upwind, but which attaches to a tanker<br>
that is moored and thereby weathervanes with the tanker. An electric current-<br>
carrying power cable can extend between the floating structure and a shore-based<br><br>
electric power structure, to deliver electric power to the floating structure to energize<br>
pumps and other equipment, or to carry electricity from a power plant on the<br>
floating structure to shore when not used at the floating structure.<br><br>

between them.<br>
15.	The system as claimed in claim 14, comprising an electricity generator<br>
(201, 230) mounted on said floating structure that supplies electricity to said<br>
equipment, and an electric switch arrangement (232) that delivers electricity<br><br>
from said generator to said power line when much of the electricity is not<br>
required for said equipment.<br>
16.	The system as claimed in claim 14, wherein said electric power facility<br>
that lies on the shore is constructed to deliver electrical power to said power<br>
line, to provide electrical power to energize said equipment.<br>
17.	A method for operating an offshore facility that lies off shore, and that<br>
unloads cold hydrocarbons from a :anker, for delivery of the hydrocarbons after<br>
warming, to a shore station on the shore, said method comprising :<br>
offloading cold hydrocarbons from the tanker to a floating structure that<br>
has a regas unit, and passing said cold hydrocarbons through said regas unit to<br>
produce warmed gaseous hydrocarbons ;<br>
flowing said warmed gaseous hydrocarbons to said shore station ; and<br>
energizing said regas unit wich electricity.<br>
18.	The method as claimed in claim 17, comprising :<br>
using some of said warmed gaseous hydrocarbons to fuel an electrical<br>
generator apparatus on said floating structure to generate enough electric<br>
power to energize said regas unit aid pressurize gas ; and<br>
delivering electricity from said electrical generator apparatus along a<br>
seafloor electric power line to an onshore facility when excess electric power is<br>
available from said electric generator apparatus.<br>
19.	The method as claimed in claim 17, which involves delivering electricity<br>
from an onshore facility along a seafloor electric power line to said floating<br>
structure to energize said regas uni: with electric power from the onshore facility.<br><br>
A system (10) is described for offloading LNG (liquified natural gas) from a tanker (13) for eventual delivery to an<br>
onshore gas distribution station (42). The system includes a floating structure (12) that floats at the sea surface and that is connected to<br>
the tanker so they weathervane together. The floating structure carries a regas unit (22) that heats the LNG to produce gas, and delivers<br>
the gas through a riser (32) to an underground cavern 30) that stores the gas. Gas from the cavern is delivered through a seafloor<br>
pipeline (40) to an onshore gas distribution station. The regas unit includes water pumps and other equipment that is powered by<br>
electricity. The electricity can be obtained from an electric generator (200) on the floating structure, with surplus electricity delivered<br>
through a seafloor electric power line (194) that extends at least partially along the seafloor to an onshore electricity distribution<br>
facility (192). The electricity can instead be obtained by delivery from an onshore facility though a seafloor electric power line that<br>
extends op to the floating structure and to the regas unit.</td>
