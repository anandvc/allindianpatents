NOVEL MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AND NEMATODE LARVAL ANTIGENS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a monoclonal antibody and nematode larval antigens. In particular the present invention relates to a monoclonal antibody specific for surface antigens on third stage larvae (L3) of parasitic nematodes.<br>
Background Art<br>
The infestations by nematode parasites of animals such as sheep and cattle are of economic importance to those in the agriculture industry. Traditionally, nematode infection has been treated by the administration of anthelmintics.<br>
However, a major drawback with conventional anthelmintics is that nematode resistance to a broad spectrum of anthelmintics is now becoming increasingly more widespread and is therefore of serious concern (Waller, 1997; Sangster et al, 1999; Van Wyketal, 1999)<br>
A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain expulsion of nematodes from the intestine of immune sheep (Rothwell 1989). There is evidence for the involvement of elements of an immediate hypersensitivity response, where antigenic stimulation of IgE-sensitised mucosal mast cells leads to an accumulation of substances in mucus which may affect nematode survival (Miller 1996; Emery et al 1997). Anti-nematode properties of mucus include the presence of chemical mediators (Douch et al 1983; Jones et al 1990) and antibody (Lee &amp; Ogilvy I9S1; Miller 1987; Carlisle et al 1991). Recently, the present inventors showed that intestinal mucus obtained from sheep immunised by multiple truncated infections could alter the normal pattern of larval establishment after incision of a mixture of larvae and mucus into the duodenum of naive recipient sheep (Harrison et al 1999).<br><br>
Mucus collected from the small intestine of sheep immune to the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis was found to have anti-larval activity, causing larvae to clump in vitro and resulting in significant reduction of numbers of larvae establishing in naive sheep after infusion of larvae and mucus via a duodenal canola.<br>
Immunoblotting showed that immune mucus contained IgG and IgA antibodies that recognised predominantly an antigen with an estimated molecular weight of 35 kDa, Antibodies eluted from the surface of larvae incubated in immune mucus also reacted with the 35 kDa antigen on blots of larval homogenate. Immnunofluonescence and immunogold electron microscopy showed that the 35 kDa antigen was present on the epistyle of L3 and was shed during the molt to L4, The antigen was not present in eggs, LI, L2, L4 or adult worms and was only seen in extracts of L3 before infection and up to 5 days after infection. The results suggest that the binding of antibody to the larval surface prevented larvae from establishing at their preferred site, causing them to be eliminated from the intestine. Lnmunisatioo of sheep with partially purified 35 kDa antigen resulted in a significant reduction of egg count following challenge with T. colubriformis, indicating the potential usefulness of this antigen in a vaccine.<br>
A monoclonal antibody designated PAB-1 was prepared against the larval surface antigen. MAb PAB-1 and sheep mucus antibody both recognised the 35 kDa T. colubriformis larval antigen and also cross reacted with an antigen of similar molecular weight on blots of 13 extracts of the parasitic nematodes Haemonchus contorts and Ostertagia circumcincta; and with a 22 kDa antigen on blots of L3 antigens extracted from Coopery cortices and Nematodirus spottier. This indicated that a common surface antigen with immunising potential was present on other nematode species and could be identified by rag PAB-1, The 35 kDa larval antigen and related molecules are likely to be novel targets for host immunity and can thus be utilized in a vaccine or other immunotherapy against nematode infections.<br><br>
Monoclonal antibody PAB-l can be used to immunopurity the surface antigen by standard affinity chromatography techniques. Monoclonal antibody PAB-l coupled to a solid phase support such as agars or sparse beds the surface antigen from a crude extract of L3. The surface antigen can be eluted from the antibody matrix using a low pH buffer and shown to be substantially pure by SDS PAGE. The surface antigen purified in this manner is detected by immunoblotting against sheep antibody from immune mucus and can be stained by methods used for detecting carbohydrates.<br>
The 35 kDa larval antigen and related molecules are known to have a predominantly carbohydrate stmbture. This is because the antigen is resistant to digestion by protein’s K: does not stain In gels treated with sensitive protein stains; does stain with carbohydrate stains and can be labeled with carbohydrate labeling reagents such as biotin-hydrazide.<br>
Accordingly, mAb PAB-l may be useful in identifying and isolating the surface antigen for development into a vaccine or other immunotherapy against nematode infections.<br>
Serum and intestinal mucus from sheep infected with T. colubriformis contains antibody that recognises the 35 kDa larval antigen and related molecules. Accordingly, as the presence of antibody to the larval antigen indicates exposure to the parasite, monoclonal antibody PAB-l may be useful as a diagnostic tool for the identification of infected animals.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The monoclonal antibody of the present invention is a monoclonal antibody which recognises carbohydrate surface antigens on L3 of parasitic nematodes. The monoclonal antibody has been found by the inventors to have the same specificity as the anti-larval antibody present in intestinal mucus from sheep immunised against <br><br>
The following outlines in general non-limiting terms the procedures for identifying and producing the antibody of the present invention.<br>
Sheep prone to nematode infection were raised nematode free from birth till four months old when a set number were immunised by a series of truncated infections with T.colubriformis L3. The remainder of the immunised sheep continued to be raised under nematode free conditions. Preferably the sheep to be used were subjected to 3 truncated infections over a period of time, each infection being terminated after a set time frame. Preferably, the set time frame may be 14 days with re-infection occurring approximately 7 days after termination, although it should be appreciated that these time frames should not be seen as limiting.<br>
After termination of the last infection the sheep were slaughtered and mucus was obtained from the small intestine, substantially in accordance with the method of Harrison et al, 1999, although this method should not be seen as limiting, as other methods may also be employed. Mucus from was also taken as outlined<br>
above.<br>
Once obtained, immune and navel mucus samples were then analyzed for differences in protein profiles, for example by SDS PAGE gel and stoning with Compassion blue or silver.<br>
The mucus antibody can then be characterised. Preferably this may be achieved by iimnunoblotting L3 homogenate antigen and probing with immune and knife mucus samples. Antibody binding may be detected by reaction with commercially available antihero raised against sheep immunoglobulins and conjugated with an enzyme. Preferably, the antibody binding may be detected by RAS/IgG-HRP.<br>
The L3 homogenate may be prepared by disruption of unsheathed L3 of any of the parasitic nematode species listed herein, using mechanical or chemical means, in the<br><br>
presence or absence of suitable detergents or denaturants, followed by clarification of the extract by centrifugation and/or filtration.<br>
Most preferably the L3 homogenate may be prepared by disruption of exsheatiied L3 of T.colubriformis frozen in liquid N2, using a mortar and pestle to grind the frozen L3 until disrupted. Larval components are then extracted into a neutral buffer e.g. 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 1-2% of a solubilising agent such as CHAPS, sodium deoxycholate, urea or SDS. The extract is clarified by centrifugations at 100 000 x g for 1 h or by filtration through a series of membranes with decreasing pore size e.g. 5.0 mm down to 0.2 m.<br>
The method for producing the monoclonal antibody mAb PAB-1 may be any suitable method such as that of Kohler and Milstein (1975).<br>
For example, the 35fcDa antigen may be excised from polyacrylamide gel slices, macerated and mixed with equal volumes of an incomplete oil adjuvant and then administered to the abdominal cavity, sub cutis, foot)ads or the like of an animal to be immunized such as mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, goat, sheep, horse, pig, dog, cat, chicken, cattle, deer or the like. Among these animals preferably a mouse is used.<br>
Antibody producing cells such as spleen cells, lymphocytes or peripheral blood cells may be collected from the immunized animal, and fished with yeoman cells, (a tumor cell strain) to form a hybrid. Spleen cells are preferable as antibody producing cells.<br>
The yeoman cells used for the cell fusion are preferably those cell lines allergenic to the immunized animal. However, cell lines of various animals can also be used.<br>
Preferably, NS-1 cells may be used as the cells. However, this should not be seen as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Though the monoclonal antibody of the present invention is typically an antibody produced by a hybridism, antibody fragments obtained by treating such an antibody with a protease not degrading the antigen-binding site (Fab) such as plantains, pepsin and papa in, i.e., Fab, F(ab')2, Facb and the like, or antibody fragments produced by molecular cloning techniques, are encompassed by the monotone antibody of the present invention, so long as they have the properties of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention.<br>
The carbohydrate surface antigen of the present invention is found on the surface of L3 of T.colubriformis, C.curticei, N.spathiger, H. contortus , O.circumcincta, T.axei, Tvitrinus, O.ostertagi, C.oncophera, N.brasiliensis and D.eckerti.<br>
The following outlines in general non-limiting terms the procedures for identifying and isolating the carbohydrate antigen of the present invention.<br>
The carbohydrate surface antigen of the present invention can be isolated from extracts of L3 of the nematodes listed herein. Preferably, the carbohydrate antigen may be isolated from extracts of T.colubriformis L3 prepared as described above. Monoclonal antibody PAB-1 may be first coupled to a solid phase support medium, preferably Protein A-agrees or Protein G-agarose and covalently linked to prevent antibody leakage from the gel.<br>
The gel may then be packed into a chromatography column and L3 extract applied. After washing with a neutral buffer, preferably PBS containing 0.05% Twine 20 to prevent non-specific binding, the bound carbohydrate antigen can be eluted from the column by applying an elution buffer of high or low pH or high salt concentration. Preferably, glycine-HCl buffer pH 2.5-2.8 may be used to elute the antigen. After elution, the pH of the carbohydrate antigen can be raised to neutrality by addition of 1 M tiis. The carbohydrate antigen is then identified by further analysis using electrophoresis and blotting against antibody from immune sheep mucus. The nature<br><br>
of the carbohydrate antigen may be determined by staining with a carfjohydrate detecting silver stain and by labeling on blots with the carbohydrate-binding reagent biotin-hydra2ide.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other carbohydrate detecting methods may also be used. Such methods may include but should not be limited to lection binding, HPLC, TLC, fiuorophore assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, MS andNMR.<br>
Methods and pharmaceutical carriers for preparation of pharmaceutical compositions are well known in the art, as set out in textbooks such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, USA.<br>
The compounds, vaccines and compositions of the invention may be administered by any suitable route, and the person skilled in the art will readily be able to determine the most suitable route and dose for the condition to be treated. Dosage will be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian, and will depend on the nature and state of the condition to be treated, the age and genera! state of health of the subject to be treated, the route of administration, and any previous treatment which may have been administered.<br>
The carrier or diluent’s, and other recipients, will depend on the route of administration, and  the person skilled in the art will readily be able to determine the most suitable formulation for each particular case.<br>
For the purposes of this specification it will be clearly understood that the word "comprising" means "including but not limited to", and that the word "comprises" has a corresponding meaning.<br><br>

1.       Materials and methods<br>
1.1      Sheep immunizations by truncated infections<br>
All sheep experiments were conducted with the approval of Aliceville Animal Ethics Committee. Romney sheep were raised aematode-firee from birth, housed in pens and fed commercial sheep pellets, hay and water ad lib. Sheep were at least 4 months old at the start of the immunising infections. Sheep were immunised by truncated infections with 40 000 T. colubriformis L3 on at least three occasions. Each infection was terminated after 14 days by oral drenching with oxfendazole (System, Schering Plough Ltd., 4.5 mg kg"') and sheep were re-infected 7 days after drenching. In some experiments, sheep were given a fourth infection (booster dose), which was not terminated by drenching, as these sheep were slaughtered 2-3 days after boosting.<br>
1.2.     Sample collection<br><br>
Sheep slaughtered by captive bolt gun and exsanguinations. The small intestine was tied off into 5 m sections and each section was washed through with 4 x 150 ml saline to collect larvae. For biochemical analysis and in vivo challenges, mucus was collected from the first 6 ra of small intestine and processed as described (Harrison et al 1999) with the following modifications. After gentle rinsing with 100 ml saline to remove gut contents, the intestine was held at 4°C for 2 h and mucus was then squeezed out by firm pressure between thumb and fogger, followed by 2 x 5 ml washes with saline. Mucus and washings were pooled and processed as described (Harrison et al 1999) and stored at-20'C.<br>
Biopsy samples of mucus were collected from groups of 4 truncated infection sheep at 3 days, 16 days and 35 days after the last immunizations. At surgery, the duodenum was located and a 5 cm section was isolated by gentle clamping with forceps. 3 ml saline was injected using a blunt ended 18-gauge needle. The liquid was teased back and forth 10 times to mix mucus with the saline and a 2-3 ml sample was then withdrawn. The incision was closed and the sheep allowed to recover.<br>
1.3      Effect of various treatments on mucus activity in vitro<br>
Ability of mucus to bind larvae was assessed by a larval clumping test where 2000 unsheathe were incubated with 0.4 ml mucus in an Splendor tube at 37°C on a rocking platform. After 4 h, samples were examined and the degree of larval clumping was estimated, compared to controls of L3 incubated with naive mucus or saline.<br>
Immune mucus was subjected to various treatments and then analysed for larval clumping activity. Aliquots of 1 ml immune mucus IPS were dialyzed for 24 h against saline at 4°C; cenlrifoged at 10 000 x g, 50 000 x g or 100 000 x g; heated at 60°C or lOO°C for 5 min; reduced and calculated by treatment with 10 mM DTT for 1 h then reaction with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min on ice followed by dialysis against<br><br>
TBS pH 7.4 overnight to remove excess sails. for peeps u-eruct,  adjusted to pH 4,5 with I M BCl and 3 mg pepsin in O.I M acetate burlap 4.5 was added to 3 ml mucus and incubated for 20 h at 37*^0 on a rocking platoon. The reaction was stopped by adding tris to 2 M. Protease treatment was conducted by adding 1 mg promise in 0.1 M tris pH 7.5 to each ml of mucus and incubating for 20 h at 37°C on a rocking platform. The reaction was stopped by adding protease inhibitors. Mucus was treated with 1 mg Ukase in PBS pH 7.2 per ml mucus, incubated at 37**C for 20 h, then stored frozen. Mucus was oxidized by adjusting the pH to 4.5 with acetic acid, adding period ate to 20 mM in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 and incubating in the dark at RT for 2 h with stirring. Sodium borohydride was then added to 50 mM and incubated for 1 h with stirring. Mucus was ultra filtered by diluting 5 ml iimnune mucus IP5 into 250 ml PBS pH 7.2 and concentrating back to 5 ml on a Filtering 100 000 mw membrane. The filtrate was then concentrated to 5 ml on a 10 000 mw membrane and this filtrate was reduced to 5 ml on a 3 000 mw membrane. The low mw filtrate was lyophilized, rediscover in 5 ml d.H20 and dialyzed in 1 000 mw tubing against d-HsO.<br>
After treatment as described above, mucus samples were stored frozen until assayed.<br>
1.4 In vivo mucus assay<br>
40 000 unsheathed L3 were incubated with 2.5-10 ml volumes of immune or naive mucus for 4-24 h before infusion into the duodenum of parasite-naive sheep via a surgically implanted catheter (Harrison et al 1999). One week later, sheep were slaughtered and the numbers of larvae establishing in each 5 m section of intestine were estimated,<br>
40 000 unsheathed L3 were incubated at 37 " C for 4 h with 10 ml volumes of unman or naive mucus, or with 2 x 10 ml volumes of mucus supernatant after centrifugation at 100 000 X g.  After incubation, one aliquot of naive and immune supernatant was<br><br>
centrifuged at 200 x g for 3 min to pellet the larvae. The supernatant was removes oy aspiration and the L3 were washed with 10 ml saline, centrifuged as above, the supernatant removed and the L3 resuspended in 10 ml saline. Each 10 ml aliquot was then infused via a duodenal cannel, into the intestine of a naive sheep. One week later, the sheep were slaughtered and larval counts obtained.<br>
1.5     Biocheniical analysis of mucus<br>
A panel of immune and naive mucus series was analysed for differences in protein profiles by SDS PAGE and staining with Compassion blue or silver. Differences in glycosylalion were examined by lectin Wetting using biotin labeled lections, detected by streptaviditi-peroxidase. Presence of IgG in mucus was demonstrated by blotting against RAS/IgG-HRP.<br>
1.6 Characterizations of mucus antibody<br>
Immunoblots of L3 homogenate antigen were probed with immune and naive mucus samples. Antibody binding was detected with RAS/IgG-HRP, or with mAb's to sheep IgGi, IgGa. IgM and IgA. followed by GAM/Ig-HRP.<br>
Exsheathed L3 were incubated for 4 h al ST^C with mucus supernatant, 45 % ammonium caliphate precipitated antibody from mucus or Protein G purified antibody from mucus. After incubation, larvae were washed 3 times with TBS-Tw and any bound antibody was eluted by incubation for 5 mins in 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.4. The equals were neutralised with 1 m tris and used to probe blots of L3 antigen from Tc, Ns and Cc.<br>
500 ml volumes of gut contents tom immune sheep were treated with 45 % ammonium sulphate to recover antibody. After dialysis, these antibodies were used to probe blots of L3 antigen. Larvae wert incubated for 2h with mucus supernatant or mucus antibody eluted from Protein G-Sparse, washed 3 tines with TBS-Tw and<br><br>
reacted with FTTC-RAS/IgG. After washing, larvae were examined by fluorescence microscopy.<br>
Larvae were collected from sheep at various times after infection and were analysed by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting as described above and by immunogold electron microscopy, larvae were fixed in BGPA fixative (1% glutaraldehyde, 15% saturated picric acid in O.IM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, at 90*^0). Embedded sections were stained with Protein G purified mucus antibody followed by gold labeled anti-sheep %.<br>
Antibody liters of mucus samples used for in vivo challenge experiments were estimated by EIA. Microstates plates were coated with Tc L3 antigen and reacted with dilutions of mucus. After washing, bound antibody was detected with RAS/lgG-HRP or mAb to sheep IgA (Serotek) followed by RAM/Ig-HRP.<br>
1.7    Preparation of monoclonal antibody PAB-1<br>
Mice Were immunised with polyacrylamide gel slices containing the Tc larval surface antigen. The location of the antigen in the gel was determined by blotting adjacent lanes and detecting the antigen with mucus antibody as described. Antigen containing gel slices were macerated, mixed with an equal volume of an incomplete oil adjuvant and injected into mice on two occasions two weeks apart. Ten days later, test bleeds were taken and screened against crude Tc L3 antigen and partially purified surface antigen. Spleen cells from the strongest positive mouse were fused with NS-1 cells using standard methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies. Primary and secondary screening was performed using ELBA and blotting to confirm specificity. A bulk culture of mAb PAB-1 was prepared and aliquots stored at -20" C.<br>
Monoclonal antibody PAB-1 was used to probe blots of larval antigens. Bound antibody was detected with RAM/IgG-HRP. Exsheathed larvae were fixed by heating<br><br>
at 90°C for 20 minutes, reacted with PAB-l, washed extensively with TBS-Tw, reacted with RAM/IgG-FTTC and examined under uv light. A mAb raised against an unrelated protein (sheep cytokine) and of the same subclass as PAB-1 was used as a negative control.<br>
1.8	Immuno-affinity purification of larval antigen<br>
Monoclonal antibody PAB-1 was reacted with Protein A-agar’s to allow the antibody to bind. After washing with PBS to remove unbound antibody, the bound antibody was permanently immobilised to the Protein A by reaction with the cross-Inking agent DSS (disuccinimidy! sunbathe). After further washing, L3 extract was run through the PAB-1-Proiein A-agarose column, washed extensively in PBS containing 0.05% Twin 20 and any bound antigen was eluted in 0.2 M glycine-HCl pH 2.5. The elate was neutralised with 1 M Tris, dialyses against 5mM Tris pH 8.0 and concentrated in a Speedway concentrator. The antibody column was re-equilibrated by extensive washing with PBS.<br>
Samples of the antigen eluted from the column were analysed by SDS PAGE and blotting (Fig.23). Carbohydrate was detected in gels by staining with a modified silver strain (Kittelberger, et al, 1993) or on blots by reaction with biotin-hydrazide (Bouchez-Mahiout, acted, 1999).<br>
1.9	Characterizations of larval antigen<br>
Exsheathed Tc L3 were frozen in liquid N2, ground with a mortar and pestle and proteins extracted by solubilisation in either 2 % Ch^s + 2 % Tween 20, 1 % sodium deoxychoiate (DOC), 2% SDS or 9 M urea. The extracts were centriiuged at 10 000 g and the supernatant stored at -20° C. Eggs, LI, L2 and adult nematodes were solubilised directly in SDS PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS. 20niM DTT in 50 mM tris-HCI pH 6.8).   SDS antigen extract was used for electrophoresis and blotting<br><br>
studies; Ch^s and urea exu-act was used for 2D electrophoresis; urea extract was dialyses against 50 mM tris-HCl pH 7.4 for 2 days to remove urea prior to chemical or enzymatic treatments. Electrophoresis was also carried out using buffer only, 0.5 % DOC or 6 M urea, with the appropriately solubilised antigen.<br>
2D electrophoresis was performed by running Tc L3 urea extract on Immobilized  on pi 3-10 strips using the foghorn (Phoenicia), followed by SDS PAGE. Proteins were either stained with Compassion blue or silver, or reacted on blots with antibody from mucus to detect antigens. Tc L3 urea-solubilised antigen was dialyzed as above and subjected to precipitation by addition of either an equal volume of 10% TCA; 10 volumes of cold acetone; 9 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1); or 9 volumes of hexane;isopropano! (3:2). Samples were vorfcxed and rocked for 10 min, centrifuged at for 10 min and the precipitated pellets analysed by immunoblotting. The role of carbohydrates was investigated by chemical and enzymatic degradation. Antigen was treated with 20 mM periodic acid at 37° C for 24 h; or with 1 M NaOH ±  18 hat 60°C. Samples were dialyses before electrophoresis. Antigen was treated with hydrazine for 7 and 14 days at lOO°C, or with trifluoroacetic acid for 4 and 16 h at ^ C, after which the chemicals were evapourated using a Speedvac centrifuge and residual antigen was resolubiiised in SDS PAGE sample buffer, Enzymatic digestions were carried out by dissolving each enzyme in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer and incubating with antigen for 22 h at 37° C. Enzymes used were N-glycosidase F, trypsin, pepsin, palm, promised, proteinase K, subdivision, lipase, lysozyme, lactase, collagen’s, phosphoinositol-phospholipase C, phospholipids A2, phospholipase D. Coloured substrates casein-restrain and elastic-Congo Red were used as controls for protease and lactase activity.    In one<br><br>
experiment, antigen was heat denatured at 90" C for 20 min prior to digestion with trypsin or NaOH. Proteinase K digestion was also performed at 50" C for 18 h with or without 0.5 %SDS, ISraMDTT, 50 mMEDTA or 2 mMCaaa. Larval extracts of Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta, Coopery cortices and Nematodirus spcuhiger were also treated with proteinase K under similar conditions.<br>
1.10   Immunizations with the 35 kDa antigen.<br>
Five Romney sheep aged 12 months were injected i.p. on 3 occasions, 2 weeks apart, with 35 kDa antigen in a vegetable oil adjuvant containing Span 85, Twecn 85 and sesame oil (ratio 5.4: 4.6; 90). The antigen was obtained from gel slices of electrophoreses aerated Tc L3 antigen. After electrophoresis, the side strips of each gel were blotted to nititxreJIulose aud reacted with immune mucus to detect the 35 kDa antigen. After development with RAS/IgG-HRP. the blots were re-aligned with the main porous of the gel and a slice was excised corresponding to the location of the 35 kDa antigen. The gel slice was placed in dialysis tubing in 100 mM tris HQ pH 7.8 and the antigen was electro eluted from the gel by placing the dialysis tubing In a blotting tank at 50 v for 3 h. Multiple elates were pooled and protein yield estimated to be 0.2 mg/ml by BCA protein assay. The antigen was blended with an equal volume of vegetable oil adjuvant using an Ultraturrax homogenizers. Each sheep received approximately 0.2 mg total protein at each injection although the amount of carbohydrate antigen was not known. Control sheep were injected i.p. with saline plus adjuvant. Two weeks after the third injection, all sheep were challenged infected orally with 40000 Tc L3. Faecal egg comit data were obtained 3 and 4 weeks after challenge.<br><br>
2.    Results<br>
2.1.	In vitro assays<br>
The ability of whole mucus or mucus subjected to various treatments to cause larval clumping in vitro is shown in Table I (refer page 33). The results indicate that dialysis or low speed centrifugation did not affect the ability of immune mucus to clump larvae. Centrifugation at 100 000 x g reduced the larval clumping effect unless the detergents or CHAPS were present. Larval clumping activity was still present after heating at 60°C for 5 min but not after heating at lOO^C. Mucus treated with protease digestion or period ate oxidation lost activity but lipase treatment had no effect. The larval clumping activity was associated with the high molecular weight fraction of mucus.<br>
2.2.	In vivo assays<br>
The effect of incubating L3 with increasing volumes of mucus, on subsequent displacement and reduction of numbers of larvae in naive recipient sheep is shown in Fig 1. Larvae that were incubated in 5 or 10 ml of naive mucus were able to establish normally in the first 5 m of small intestine. Larvae that were incubated in immune mucus were progressively displaced or rejected as the volume of mucus was increased. Incubation of larvae with 10 ml immune mucus resulted in 82 % reduction of larvae establishing and 100 % displacement of larvae out of the first 5 m of intestine, compared to naive mucus.<br>
The effect of incubating L3 with 10 ml volumes of mucus for different times is shown in Fig. 2. Incubation of immune mucus and L3 for as little as 1 h resulted in 46 % reduction of larval establishment and 81 % displacement from the first 5 m. Incubation for 4,10 or 24 h resulted in &gt;94 % reduction and &gt;93 % displacement.<br><br>
The effect on larval establishment of incubating 13 with 16 naive mucus samples and 25 immune mucus samples is shown in Fig. 3. Overall there was 67 % reduction of larvae establishing in recipients of L3 + immune mucus (range 0-95%) and there were 80 % fewer larvae establishing in the first 5 m of intestine (P<d.001 of sheep given l3 immune mucus.></d.001>
The influence of time of mucus collection on the anti-larval properties of mucus is shown in Fig. 4. Mucus collected 2-3 days after the last immunising dose of larvae was generally more active than mucus collected 1 week or later. Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between protection and time of mucus collection after immunization.<br>
The effect of incubating L3 with the 100 000 x g supematants of naive or immune mucus, with or without subsequent washing, is shown in Table 2 (refer page 34). The result shows that L3 incubated in naive mucus, supernatant or supernatant plus washing, were able to establish in naive sheep. In contrast, L3 that had been incubated in immune mucus, supematant or supernatant plus washing, were mostly prevented from establishing and there were 91 % fewer L3 than in sheep receiving L3 treated with naive mucus.<br>
2.3 Mucus biochemistry<br>
Electrophoreses separation of mucus is shown in Fig. 5. The protein profiles of immune and naive mucus were highly complex and no clear cut differences were observed between the two sets of mucus. Leda blotting also showed complex glycoprotein profiles for both sets of mucus (Figs 6, 7, 8) indicating that ranges of carbohydrate moieties were present. Again there was no clear difference in the binding of lecterns to immune or naive mucus, with the exception of peanut agglutinin (Fig. 7A) where increased staining was seen with most of the immune samples at mw's of approximately 70 000 and 28 000 which may correspond to Ig heavy and<br><br>
light chains. However, when mucus was reacted with RAS/IgG-HRP, major bands were seen in all samples at 55 000 and 27 000, which probably correspond to IgG heavy and light chains (Fig 8B).<br>
2.4 Mucus blotting<br>
Immunoblots of TcLS antigen probed with mucus or antibodies recovered from mucus are shown in Fig. 9. Six naive mucus samples Oanes 13-18) did not react with L3 antigen. Immune mucus samples reacted predominantly with a 35 kDa band as did antibody recovered by ammonium sulphate precipitation of gut contents from 2 humane sheep (lanes 8 and 9). Antibody from immune mucus supernatant purified on Protein G-agarose and antibody acid-eluted from L3 incubated with immune mucus also reacted with the 35 kDa band Oases 4,7 and 6,20). Both IgG and IgA antibodies could be eluted off the L3 (Fig 9, lanes 6 and 20). Serum from sheep given 3 truncated infections with Tc also contained antibodies that recognised the 35 kDa band plus many others (not shown). Antibody isotope specificity of the antibodies in mucus reacting with the 35 kDa band are shown in Fig. 10. IgGj and IgA ecotype antibodies were present but IgG2 or IgM antibodies were not detected.<br>
Immunoblots of L3 antigen extracts from the intestinal parasitic nematodes Nematodirus spathiger Q^s) and Cooperia curticei (Cc) probed with mucus from Tc immune sheep showed predominant reactivity wifli bands at 22 kDa (Fig. 11, lanes 9 and 13). Senim from sheep given truncated infections of Ns reacted with these antigens in both Ns and Cc Oanes 12 and 16) and also with the 35 kDa band in Tc (laneg). Incubating 2 ml immune mucus with 260000 exsheathed Tc L3 resulted in complete depletion of antibody fii^m the mucus (lane I). Colloidal gold protein stain was used to detect proteins on the blot (lane 4). No staining was seen in the region corresponding to that detected by antibody from immune mucus (lanes 3 and 4). Extracts ftt)m L3 of the intestinal nematodes N. spathiger and C curticei and the<br><br>
abomasal nematodes H. contorlus and O. circumcincta were probed with Tc immune sheep mucus and showed reactions at 35 kDa for Tc and He; 39 kDa for Oc; 46 and 22 kDa for Cc; and 22 for Ns (Fig 12). Figure 33 shows blots of 1 M NaOH extracts of the intestinal nematodes T.axei(Ta), T.vitrinus (Tv), O.ostertagi (Ooi, C.oncophera (Co) and D.eckerti (De) and of the abomasal nematodes H. contortus (He) and O. circumcincta (Oc) the blots were probed with Tc immune sheep mucus and showed reactions at 35 kDa for Ta, Tv and He; 45, 35, 33 and 30 kDa for Oo; 45 and 20 kDa for Co; 12 and 9 kDa for ^n&gt;; and 30 kDa for De.<br>
The correlation between mucus IgG and IgA antibody litres and the protection affforded by mucus used for in vivo challenges was analysed by linear regression (Fig 13). There was a significant relationship between the titres of IgG and IgA antibodies against L3 antigen and protection (R^ = 0.6; P 
Antibody tires of mucus biopsy san^&gt;les were high at day 3 after immunizations (Fig 14) but lx&gt;Th IgG and IgA titers fell away by 16 days but were still above backroom at 37 days after immunizations.<br>
Immunofluorescent staining of larvae is shown in Hg 15. Exsheathed L3 showed strong surface fluorescence after incubation with antibody from immune mucus but not with naive mucus (top panel). Larvae collected from sheep infected for 2, 3 or 4 days also showed surface staining (not shown) but at day 5 after infection, many larvae did not stain with antibody and some were observed in the process of moulting Gower panel). The shed L3 cuticle reacted with antibody from immune mucus but the emerging L4 did not stain. L4 collected at day 6 and 7 after infection also did not show surface staining.<br>
Immunogold electron microscopy revealed a similar pattern of results where sections of L3 showed surface labelling with gold particles on the epicuticle (panel B, Fig 16).<br><br>
Gtold labelling was also observed on day 2 after infection, was weaker at day 3 and 4 and absent at day 5 (panels C, D, E and F, respectively).<br>
Immunoblots of antigen extracts from eggs, LI, 12, L3 and from larvae collected at various times after infection were probed with mucus antibody (Figs 17 &amp; 18). The 35 kDa antigen was seen in L3 before infection and up to 5 days after infection but was not present in the egg stage, LI or L2, or in L4 at days 7 or 14 after infection, or in adult nematodes.<br>
2.5	Monoclonal antibody PAB-1<br>
Comparative blotting reactions of mAb PAB-1 and Tc immune sheep mucus antibody against Tc L3 antigen are shown in Fig 19. The mAb reacted with the main Tc L3 antigen at 35 kDa, a diffuse antigen at 35-40 kDa and a number of lower molecular weight antigens.<br>
Identification of antigens in other nematode species is shown in Fig 20. Extracts from L3 of the intestinal nematodes N. spathiger and C. curticei and the abdominals nematodes H. contortus and O. circumcincta were probed with mAb PAB-1 and showed reactions at approximately 35 kDa for Tc and He; 39 kDa for Oc; 46 and 22 kDa for Cc; and 22 for Ns (Fig 20). After digestion of L3 extracts with proteinase K, immunoblotting against antibody from immune mucus or nnAb PAB-1 showed that the larval antigens were not destroyed by this enzyme (Figs 19 and 20).<br>
Reaction of mAb PAB-1 with escheated Tc L3 showed strong surface fluorescence after staining with anti-mouse FTTC conjugate (Fig.2l). An IgGa control mAb did not react with the larval surface.<br>
2.6	Immune-affinity purification of larval antigen<br><br>
The results of immuno-affinity purification of larval antigen using the monoclonal antibody PAB-1 coupled to Protein A-agarose are stiown in Figure 22. Silver staining of the eluate showed that no protein-staining band was visible in the region where the larval antigen was expected to run. A single carbohydrate staining band was detected in the eluate which ran at the same molecular weight as the antigen detected by immunoblotting with antibody from immune sheep mucus. Tliis band was also libeled in situ with biotin-hydrazide reagent which binds to exposed sugar residues after period ate oxidation.<br>
2.7 Characterizations of larval antigen<br>
The effect of various chemical and enzymatic treatments of L3 antigen on the immunoblot reaction of mucus antibody against the 35 kDa antigen is shown in Pigs 23-30. Heating the antigen 813?" C for 18 h had no effect on the unmunoblot reaction to the 35 kDa antigen (Fig 23, lane 2). Treatment with periodic add or lipase slightly reduced the signal strength (Fig 23, lanes 3, 5) but pronase had no effect Qane 4). The 35 kDa antigen was found in the precipitate after either acid or solvent precipitation (lanes 6-9).<br>
Treatment of L3 antigen with trypsin, pepsin, proteinase K or phospholipase A2 caused the blot reaction to become more diffuse but did not reduce the molecular weight (Fig 24, lanes 2, 3,5,11). Treatment with pepsin, subdivision or lying enzymes reduced the signal but did not alter the molecular weight (lanes 6-8). Promise, lipase, lysozyme, phosphoinositol-phospholipase C and phospholipase D had no effect flanes 4, 9, 10, 12, 13). Treatment with lactase resulted in the appearance of a slightly lower molecular weight band (Fig 25, lane 1). CoUagenase and proteinase K at 37" C had no effect (lanes 2, 3, 4). Proteinase K treatment at SO'^C for 18 h under various conditions also did not destroy the 35 IcDa antigen whichh could still be detected on<br><br>
blots (lanes 6-9). Treatment of L3 antigen with N-glycosidase r signup reduce UK blot signal but did not decrease the molecular weight of the 35 kDa antigen (Fig 26, lane 4) under conditions where the control glycoprotein feting was degraded (lane 2) indicating that the enzyme was active. Treatment with 1 M NaOH at 60° C for IS h resulted in an increase in the number of lower molecular weight bands seen on the blot but the reaction at 35 kDa was still dominant (Fig 27, lane 2). After treatment with NaOH plus NaBH4 , no protein was visible by silver staining although the blot reaction of the 35 kDa antigen was undiminished compared to the control antigen (Fig 27, lane 3).<br>
Treatment of L3 antigen with hydrofluorous acid for 48 h at 4^* C or with hydrazine for I h at 20° C or for 16 h at lOO" C, did not destroy the 35 kDa antigen (Fig 28). Treatment with hydrazme for 7 or 14 days at 100° C reduced the blot signal compared to untreated control antigen (Fig 29, lanes 1, 2). Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h or 16 h destroyed the antigen (Fig 29, lanes 4, 5).<br>
ligament of L3 antigen by the following procedures did not destroy the 35 kDa antigen as shown by Immunoblotting (Fig 30): proteinase K + SDS for 4 h or 20 h at 50°C (lanes I &amp; 2): O.l-I.O M NaOH treatment at 37"c for 18 h (Fig 30, lanes 3,6,7,8): heat menstruation at 90'^ C for 20 min prior to digestion with I M NaOH Games 4): trypsin digestion at 37° C for 22 h with or without heat penetration at 90° C for 20 min Wanes 10 &amp; 14); proteinase K ■¥ SDS + DTT at 50° C for 22 h (lane 12). Proteinase K digestion of L3 extracts from five nematode species did not destroy the Tc 35 kDa antigen or the cross-reacting antigens of the other species present at 46, 35 or 22 kDa (Fig 20).<br><br>
Tc L3 extract was analysed by electrophoresis and blotting under native conditions and in the presence of 0.5 % DOC or 6 M urea. The antigen ran as a high molecular weight sraear under these conditions (Fig 32). Addition of reducing agent (20 mM DTT) to the samples and the electrophoresis buffer did not alter these profiles (not shown).<br>
2D electrophoretic analysis of Tc L3 urea extract showed a strong immunoblot reaction at 35 kDa, which extended across the range pH 3-10 (Fig 33). Despite the strong blot signal, no protein was visible in the corresponding region.<br>
3.6. Sheep immunisation trial<br>
FEC data are shown in Table 3 (refer page 34). At week 3 after challenge, there was no significant difference in FEC between groups but at week 4, the counts were significantly lower in the immunised group (i'<:0.05 when counts from both weeks were combined there was also a significant reduction of fec overall in the immunised group></:0.05>
Figure 34 shows a Gel electrophoresis (8 % PAGE) and inmiunoblot analysis of T. colubriformis L3 extract (L3) and purified carbohydrate larval antigen (C) run under non-denaturing conditions (no detergent or reducing agent). Gels were stoned for protein or carbohydrate. Blots were reacted with mAb PAB-1 followed by rabbit anti-mouse Ig-HRP conjugate, or with immune sheep mucus followed by rabbit anti-sheep Ig-HRP conjugate.<br><br>
obsei-ved that larvae were frequently clumped together after incubation in immune mucus and that these larvae were prevented from establishing normally when infused into naive sheep via a duodenal cannel (Harrison et al 1999). These observations were extended in the present study and showed conclusively that immune mucus can effectively prevent establishment of larvae. The degree of protection gains infection depended on the time of mucus collection after immunization as well as dose volume. This correlates with the declining level of antibody in mucus over time as seen in mucus biopsy samples taken from truncated infection sheep up to 5 weeks after immunization. The observation that the 100 000 x g supernatant of immune mucus could also prevent larval establishment indicates that this activity sides in the soluble fraction of mucus and does not result from physical blocking by mucus e.g. by viscosity. Washing the larvae after incubation did not affect the abuts of immune mucus supernatant to prevent establistiment, indicating that the activity factor was bound to the larvae.<br>
In vitro analysis of larval clumping after treatment of immune mucus by dialysis, centrifugation or molecular weight filtration, indicated that the clumping activity was associated wifli the high molecular weight fraction of mucus. Heat treatment and protease digestion suggested that clumping required the protein component of mucus. However, SDS PAGE analysis and protein detection with Compasses blue or silver staining did not reveal differences in the crude protein profiles of a panel of immune and naive mucus samples. Similarly, lectin blotting did not show differences in glycoprotein composition between the two panels of mucus, with the exception of peanut agglutinin, which may have detected carbohydrates present on heavy and light chains and seen in immune mucus samples. The heavy chains were at 70 kDa which could indicate the presence of IgA. Blotting also showed the presence of IgG in all mucus samples.<br>
The above observations and presence of IgG and IgA in immune mucus suggested that<br><br>
antibodies recognising nematode antigens were responsible for larval clumping and for in vivo protection, taimunoblots of larval antigen probed with immune mucus showed the presence of IgGi and IgA antibodies which reacted predominantly with a major antigen at 35 kDa plus diffuse regions at 9, 12, 20, 30-45 kDa. Significantly, blots of L3 antigens probed with antibodies eluted from intact exsheathed larvae after incubation in immune mucus also showed predominant reaction to this antigen. This result, plus the surface fluorescent staining and immunogold electron microscopy, show that the epitopes are present on the surface of the larvae. Anti-35 kDa antibody was present in mucus samples used for in vivo challenge experiments and there was a significant correlation between the degree of protection afforded by immune mucus and the titer of Fig and . Mucus antibody from T. colubriformis immune sheep also recognised antigens on blots of larval extracts from other intestinal nematodes C. cortices,. N. spathiger, T.axei, Tvitrinus, O.ostertagi, C.oncophera, N.brasiliensis and D.eckerti and from aromas nematodes H. contortus and O. circwncincta. This cross-reactivity indicates that a surface molecule with similar function to the T. colubriformis 35 kDa antigen exists in other nematode species and could be a target for immunizations. Monoclonal antibody PAB-1 also reacted with these antigens and could thus be used to identify and purify these surface antigens from parasitic nematode species. The finding that ail the cross-reacting antigens tested so far are resistant to digestion by proteinase K is evidence that they are also not proteins and thus share similar properties to the T. colubriformis 35 kDa antigen.<br>
Monoclonal antibody PAB-1 coupled to Protein A-I arose was able to purify T.colubrifonnis larval surface antigen. This T.colubriformis larval surface antigen was found to be predominantly carbohydrate as shown by its resistance to digestion with a range of proteases including proteinase K; by staining with a silver stain modified to detect carbohydrate groups and by labeling with a biotin-hydrazide reagent which binds to exposed sugar residues. The antig°en did not stain with protein<br><br>
detecting methods such as silver stain, Compasses blue or gold. The antigen was resistant to degradation by the action of lipases and was not soluble in organic solvents which suggests that lipid components are not present or not accessible. N-glycosidase F treatment did not affect the antigen indicating either that the sugars ait not N-Inked or that they are not accessible to enzyme attack. Alkali treatment or extensive hydrazinolysis did not destroy the antigen which may indicate an unusual carbohydrate structure. Strong acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid destroyed the antigen.<br>
The observation of a multiple banding pattern in the form of a ladder of lower molecular weight antigens on blots of T. colubriformis larval extent probed with mAb PAB-1, could indicate that the structure of the 35 kDa antigen consists of a polymer of a smaller unit. In its native state on the larval surface, however, the antigen is a high molecular weight complex as shown by the electrophoresis results using non-denaturing conditions. Solubilisation in SDS + DTT reduced the complex to an antigen detectable on blots at 35 kDa suggesting that the complex is a polymer of the 35 kDa antigen or a heteropolymer of 35 kDa antigen plus other components as yet unidentified. The antigen shows charge heterogeneity when started by is electric focussing, again indicating a complex structure. The results suggest that this molecular complex, present on the outer surface of larvae, is likely to resist degradation by all physiological conditions found in the stomach and intestines of the nematode' s host, The functional implications of these properties of the larval surface antigen have yet to be determined but it seems likely that this complex has evolved to protect the larva during transit through the hostile environment of the host system until it reaches it's site of predilection in the small intestine. The 35 kDa antigen was only found in the L3 before infection and up to 5 days after infection, suggesting that the coating was required for protection during transit through the stomach. During the moult to L4 stage in the small intestine, the protective coating is shed as it is no longer<br><br>
required. It will be appreciated that an immune response directed against this protective coat could severely compromise the nematode's ability to establish succession in its host and could therefore have wide implications for nematode control. In a preliminary vaccine trial in sheep, immunizations with a vaccine containing partially purified 35 kDa antigen and an oil adjuvant resulted in a significant reduction of faecal egg count in the vaccinated group compared to controls.<br>
Aspects of the present invention have been described by way of example only and it should be appreciated that modifications and additions may be made thCTeto without departing from the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
