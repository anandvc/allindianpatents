Process for the preparation of tryptase inhibitors<br>
This invention is directed to processes for the preparation of compounds which are useful as tryptase inhibitors, to intermediates useful in the preparation of such compounds, to processes for the preparation of such intermediates, and to the use of such intermediates for the preparation of such compounds.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, in particular asthma, are a growing public health concern. Asthma is frequently characterized by progressive development of hyper-responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to both immunospecific allergens and generalized chemical or physical stimuli, which lead to the onset of chronic inflammation. Leukocytes containing lgE receptors, notably mast cells and basophils, are present in the epithelium and underlying smooth muscle tissues of bronchi. These leukocytes initially become activated by the binding of specific inhaled antigens to the lgE receptors and then release a number of chemical mediators. For example, degranulation of mast cells leads to the release of proteoglycans, peroxidase, arylsulfatase B, chymase, and tryptase, which results in bronchiole constriction.<br>
Tryptase is stored in the mast cell secretory granules and is the major secretory protease of human mast cells. Tryptase has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including degradation of vasodilating and bronchorelaxing neuropeptides (Caughey et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 1988, 244, pages 133-137; Franconi et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther,, 1988,248, pages 947-951; and Tarn et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 1990, 3, pages 27-32) and modulation of bronchial responsiveness to histamine (Sekizawa et al., J. Clin. Invest, 1989, 83, pages 175-179).<br>
As a result, tryptase inhibitors are regarded as useful as anti-inflammatory agents (K. Rice, P.A. Sprengler, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, 1999, 2, pages 463-474) particularly in the treatment of chronic asthma (M.Q. Zhang, H.<br><br>
Timmerman, Mediators Inflamm., 1997,112, pages 311-317), and may also be useful in treating or preventing allergic rhinitis (S. J. Wilson et al., Clin. Exp. Allergy, 1998, 28, pages 220-227), inflammatory bowel disease (S.C. Bischoff et al., Histopathology, 1996, 28, pages 1-13), psoriasis (A. Naukkarinen et al., Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1993, 285, pages 341-346), conjunctivitis (AAlrani et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1990, 86, pages 34-40), atopic dermatitis (A. Jarvikallio et al., Br. J. Dermatol., 1997,136, pages 871-877), rheumatoid arthritis (L.C Tetlow et al., Ann. Rheum. Dis., 1998, 54, pages 549-555), osteoarthritis (M.G. Buckley et al., J. Pathol., 1998,186, pages 67-74), gouty arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, and diseases of joint cartilage destruction.<br>
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a potent mrtogen for fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in the pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and interstitial lung diseases (Ruoss et al., J. Clin. Invest, 1991, 88, pages 493-499).<br>
Therefore, tryptase inhibitors are regarded as useful in treating or preventing fibrotic conditions (J.A. Cairns, A.F. Walls, J. Clin. Invest., 1997, 99, pages 1313-1321) for example, fibrosis, scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas and hypertrophic scars.<br>
Additionally, tryptase inhibitors are regarded as useful in treating or preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture (M. Jeziorska et al., J. Pathol., 1997, 182, pages 115-122).<br>
Tryptase has also been discovered to activate prostromelysin that in turn activates collagenase, thereby initiating the destruction of cartilage and periodontai connective tissue, respectively.<br>
Therefore, tryptase inhibitors are regarded as useful in the treatment or prevention of arthritis, periodontai disease, diabetic retinopathy, and tumor growth (W.J. Beil et al., Exp. Hematol., 1998, 26, pages 158-169). Also, tryptase inhibitors are regarded as useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis (LB. Schwarz et al., J. Clin. Invest, 1995, 96,<br><br>
pages 2702-2710), multiple sclerosis (M. Steinhoff et al., Nat. Med. (N. Y.), 2000, 6, pages 151-158), peptic ulcers and syncytial viral infections.<br>
Compounds of formula I<br><br>
have been disclosed as being useful as tryptase inhibitors, for example, in WO 01790101 and WO 2004/060884 (international patent application PCT/US2003/040653). Processes for preparing compounds of formula I are aiso disclosed therein, however, they suffer from substantial drawbacks and hazards, in particular when it is desired to prepare a compound of the formula l on a large scale. The present invention provides advantageous processes which are useful in the preparation of compounds of the formula I and allow to overcome the drawbacks and avoid the hazards of the prior art processes.<br>

In the processes and compounds according to the invention the groups R1, R1', R2 and R2, which are attached to the benzene rings depicted in the formulae herein, may independently of one another be present one or more times, for example one, two or three times. Preferably they are independently of one another present one or two times. More preferably, one group R1 or R1' is present and one group R2 or R2" is present. When more than one of any of the groups R1, R1', R2and R2" is present, they can all independently of one another have the meanings indicated herein and can be the same or different. Positions on the benzene rings depicted in the formulae herein which do not carry a group R1,R1', R2 or R2' or another group drawn in the formulae, carry hydrogen atoms. I.e., in a compound of the formula 1 in which one group R1 and one group R2 is present, the benzene ring carrying R1 carries three hydrogen atoms in addition to the group R1 and the group -CH2NH2, and the benzene ring carrying R2 carries four hydrogen atoms in addition to the group R2. In a compound of the formula I in which two groups R2 are present, the benzene ring carrying R2 carries three hydrogen atoms in addition to the group R2. The groups R\ R1', R2 and R21 can be present in any desired positions. For example, in a compound of the formula 1 in which one group R2 is present that is drfferent from hydrogen, R2 can be present in position 2, 3 and 4 with respect to the ethyne moiety which, by definition, is present is position 1. If two groups R2 are present that are drfferent from hydrogen, they can be present in 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- and 3,5-position. Similarly, if one group R1 is<br><br><br>
present that is different from hydrogen, it can be present in position 2, 3, 4 and 6 with respect to the position of the piperidine residue which is present in position 1, if the position of the group -CH2NH2 in a compound of the formula I or of the group derived therefrom in the other compounds of the invention is designated as position 5 (if the position of the group -CH2-NH2 is designated as position 3, the group R1 can be present in position 2,4, 5 and 6).<br>
Saits of a compound according to or related to the present invention, i.e. any compound which is employed into a process or which is obtained by a process or which occurs as an intermediate in a process described herein, including any compound which is a subject of the present invention per se, which contains one or more basic groups, i.e. protonatable groups such as amino groups, piperidinyl groups, pyridinyl groups and/or other basic heterocyclic groups, are in particular acid addition salts formed by the respective compound and inorganic or organic acids, including mineral acids and organic carboxylic acids and suffonic acids. Examples of acids which may form such salts are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, fumarie acid, maleic acid, methanesutfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesutfonic acid, p-toluenesuifonic acid, etc. Compounds which contain two or more basic groups can form acid addition salts with one acid equivalent or with two or more acid equivalents. In particular in the case of compounds of the formulae I and la which are intended for use as in the production of pharmaceutical compositions or for use as pharmacologically active ingredients, preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts or pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are non-toxic and exhibit a suitable property profile for the intended use. However, the present invention includes also salts which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in Pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically acceptable salts, for example by ion exchange procedures. Salts may be obtained by any process as described herein or by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art such as, for example, by contacting a basic compound with<br><br>
an acid in a solvent, or by ion exchange from another salt. Likewise, by applying customary methods such as contacting a salt with a base in a solvent, a salt can be converted into the free base ff desired, for example if an intermediate which has been isolated as a salt is needed in a subsequent reaction step as the free base.<br>
In the processes and compounds according to the present invention, and in particular for various values of R1 and R2, it may be advantageous or necessary to protect reactive functional groups, where these are desired in the final product, or let them be present initially in form of precursor moieties which are later converted into the desired group, in order to avoid their unwanted participation in reactions according to processes of the present invention. Conventional protecting groups and precursor moieties and processes for introduction and their removal or conversion into the desired groups may be used in accordance with standard practice known to one skilled in the art, for example as described in T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br>
In the processes and compounds according to the present invention R1 and R1' preferably are H, F, CF3l OCF3, (C1-C4)-alkyl, (C3-C7)-cycloalkyl, phenyl, (1-C4)-alkoxy, phenoxy or di((C1-C,4)-aikyI)amino, more preferably H, F, CF3, OCF3, (C1-C4) alkyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxy, or di((C1-C4)-alkyl)amino, particularly preferably H, F, CF3, OCF3, (C1-C4)-alkyl or (C1-C4)-alkoxy, more particularly preferably H, F, CF3, OCF3, CH3 or OCH3l especially preferably H or F, moreover preferably H.

R2 and R2" preferably are H, F, CF3, OCF3, (C1-C4)-alkyl, {C3-C7)-cycloalkyl, phenyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxy, phenoxy or di((C1-C4)-alky|)amino, more preferabl H, F, CF3, OCF3l (CrC4)-alkyl.

In case that one residue R2 or R2 is present, in a moreover preferred embodiment of the present<br><br>
Dlfowing, further explanations on the processes according to the present<br>
on are given. In the Schemes below groups like R1, R2, R1’ and R2' are defined<br>
, Boc is tert-butoxycarbonyl, Ph is phenyl and nBu is n-butyl.<br>
npounds of the formula I are prepared by processes according to the present m as shown in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
The phenylethynylsilyl compound of the formula II, wherein G is trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, tri-isopropylsifyl, or dimethyl-tert-butylsilyl, is treated with an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonaie or alcoholate, for example the respective sodium or potassium compound, or an alkaline earth metal alcoholate, for example a magnesium or calcium alcoholate, preferably with potassium carbonate, in a solvent, such as an aliphatic alcohol or a mixture of an aliphatic alcohol and an ether, for example methanol or ethanol or a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably of from about 10°C to about 30°C, to give a solution of the corresponding phenylethynyl compound of the formula III which phenylethynyl compound is not isolated, thus avoiding the hazards that would be associated with the handling of the unstable phenylethynyl compound. The base can be employed in a catalytic amount, for example in an amount of from about 0.02 to about 0.05 mol per mol of the compound of formula II, or in a greater amount up to an about equivalent amount, for example an amount of from about 0.02 to about 1.1 mol of a monovalent base per mol of the compound of the formula II.<br>
The solution of the phenylethynyl compound is combined with the amide of the formula IV in a solvent, such as an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethyl carbonate, or a mixture of an ether with an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, and reacted in the presence of a homogeneous palladium catalyst, for example Pd(PPh3)2CI2, a cuprous salt, for example copper(l)iodide, copper(l)bromide, copper(l)chloride or copper(l)trifluoromethane- sulfonate, where the cuprous salt can also be formed in situ from a cupric sail, for example copper{fl)acetate, and a hindered amine, for example triethylamine, tributylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, diethylamine, pyrrolidine or piperidine, at a temperature of from about 30"C to about 70°C. The compound of the formula III or II, respectively, is preferably employed in a slight excess, for example in an amount of from about 1 to about 1.5 mol per mol of the compound of the formula IV. The employed amount of the palladium catalyst and the cuprous salt each preferably is from about 0.005 to about 0.2, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 0.05 mol<br><br><br>
per mol of the compound of the formula IV, and the amount of the hindered amine preferably is from about 1 to about 10, more preferably from about 1 to about 5 mol per mol of the compound of the formula II.<br>
Work-up of the reaction mixture can be performed by customary procedures, as applies to all processes of the present invention, including treatment of the organic phase with brine, dilute hydrochloric acid, and aqueous sodium carbonate, to provide the Boc-protected compound of the formula V. In a surprising aspect of the present invention the reagents present in the solution resulting from treatment of the phenylethynylsilyl compound of the formula II do not interfere with the subsequent coupling reaction with the compound of the formula IV.<br>
The Boc-protected compound of the formula V can be used as a storage form of the compound of the formula I, for example. If it is desired to prepare the compound of the formula I Itself or its salt the compound of the formula V is subsequently deprotected by splitting off the Boc group and, if applicable, removal of any other protective groups and/or conversion of precursor moieties that may be present in R1 and/or R2. Preferably the compound of the formula V is deprotected under acidic conditions, in particular from a compound in which R1' and R2" are R1 and R2, advantageously by means of a physiologically acceptable acid such as methanesulfonic acid, for example, in a solvent such as isopropanol, for example, at a temperature of from about 10°G to about 80°C, to yield the compound of formula I or its salt, preferably the salt with the acid employed into the deprotection step.<br>
The compound of the formula IV can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 2. When starting from 5-bromo-2-furoic acid or 5-iodo-2-furoic acid of the formula XVIII, wherein X is bromo or iodo, the acid is first activated as outlined above to give an activated acid derivative of the formula XIX wherein X is bromo or iodo and A is a leaving group, for example chloro or bromo, or the formula XIX represents the adduct obtained form the acid and a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide, or the mixed anhydride obtained from the acid and an alkyl chlorocarbonate. Preferably the acid of the formula XVIII is treated with thionyl chloride in refluxing toluene until gas evolution<br><br>
ceases to provide a solution of the acid chloride of the formula XIX wherein A is chloro, which solution may be used, if desired, in the subsequent step without isolation of the acid chloride. The activated acid derivative of the formula XIX is combined with the 4-[3-(tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]piperidine of the formula VI in a solvent, optionally in the presence of a base, for example a tertiary amine like triethylamine, to provide the corresponding amide of the formula IV, generally at a temperature of from about -10°C to about 40°C, preferably from about 10°C to about 30°C The 4-t3-(tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]piperidine of the formula VI may be liberated from a salt of a compound of the formula VI, for example a salt with p-toluenesulfonic acid, by treatment with a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide or alcoholate, such as sodium hydroxide, and extracting the compound of the formula VI into a solvent such as, for example, toluene or dichloromethane, followed by drying of the solution.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
Previously described processes for the preparation of compounds of the formula I include the process for the preparation of the specffic compound 4-[3-(aminomethyl)phenyl]~1-[5-(2-fluorophenytethynyl)-2-furanoyl]piperidine<br><br>
methanesulfonic acid salt which is described in WO 2004/060884 (international patent application PCT/US2003/040653) and shown in Scheme 3.<br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
According to the previously described process, 2-fluorophenylethyne of the formula IIIa is coupled to methyl 5-bromo-2-furoate of the formula XX via a palladium<br><br>
mediated process. Work-up and chromatography yields methyl 5-(2-fluorophenyfethynyl)-2-furoate of the formula XXI, which is saponified and recrystallized to give the respective acid of the formula XXII. Conversion of the acid into the acid chloride of the formula XXIII is accomplished with oxalyl chloride. Acylation of 4-[3-(tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]piperidine of the formula Via which, according to the prior process, is prepared in a tedious process using costly reagents as outlined below, with the acid chloride gives N-Boc-protected 4-[3-(aminomethyl)phenyl]-1-[5-(2-fluorophenylethynyl)-2-furanoyl]piperidine oft he formula Va. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography followed by trituration with diethyl ether/pentane or, alternatively, recrystallization. By treatment with methanesulfonic acid the Boc group is removed and 4-[3-(aminomethyf)phenyl]-1-[5-(2-fiuorophenylethynyl)-2-furanoyl]piperidine methanesulfonic acid salt of the formula Ib is obtained.<br>
A substantial drawback of the earlier disclosed processes is the use of phenyiethynes as starting materials which are known to be unstable. For example, 2-fluorophenylethyne decomposes violently at approximately 120°C. The use of phenyiethynes thus poses a safety hazard, in particular in large scale productions. The present invention provides advantageous processes which are useful in the preparation of compounds of the formula I and are distinguished by generation of the phenylethyne from the siiyi compound in situ without need for isolation of the phenylethyne, thus allowing to avoid the handling of hazardous compounds.<br>
The 4-[3-(tert-butoxycarbonyIaminomethyl)phenyl]piperidines of the formula VI useful as intermediates in the processes of the present invention may be prepared by processes of the present invention, for example, as shown in Scheme 4.<br><br><br>
Scheme 4<br>
Accordingly, a 3-iodobenzylamine or 3-bromobenzylamine of the formula VII in the form of its salt, for example the hydrochloride salt, in a solvent, for example a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, is treated with an about equimolar amount of 1,2-bis(chlorodimethylsilyl)ethane in the presence of a base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, preferably at a temperature of from<br><br>
about 10°C to about 30°C. Work-up of the reaction mixture can be accomplished by filtration, evaporation of the filtrate, and treatment of the residue with an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, for example pentane, to remove any residual amine salt, to provide the corresponding 3-halobenzyl compound of the formula VIM, i.e., the corresponding 1-(3-bromobenzy1)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-aza-2,5-disilacyclopentaneor 1-(3-iodobenzyl)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-a2a-2,5-disilacyclopentane.<br>
The compound of the formula VIII is then treated with an alkyllithium compound, for example n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, t-butyllithium or hexylithium, in a solvent, for example an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, and subsequently with 1-benzyl-4-piperidone at a reduced temperature, such as a temperature of from about -80°C to about -40*C, for example at about -60°C, to provide the corresponding alcohol of the formula IX, which may be earned forward, if desired, without further purification. The alkyllithium compound and the 1-benzyl-4-piperidone are usually employed in an amount of from about 1 to about 1.2 and about 1 to about 1.1 mol, respectively, per mol of the compound of the formula VIII.<br>
The alcohol of the formula IX is then treated with an inorganic acid, for example sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid, preferably phosphoric acid, which may be dilute or concentrated, in a solvent, for example a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, in the presence of water, at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 30cC, to provide the corresponding benzylamine of the formula X as its salt with the employed acid, which may be carried forward, if desired, without further purification.<br>
The salt of the benzylamine of the formula X is then dehydrated with a concentrated, non-oxidizing strong acid, for example phosphoric acid, sutfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or toluenesulfonic acid, preferably phosphoric acid, at an elevated temperature, for example at a temperature of from about 70°C to about 150°C, preferably at about 100°C, followed by alkalinization with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or alcoholate, for example sodium hydroxide, to provide the corresponding<br><br><br>
olefin of the formula XI, which may be carried forward, if desired, without further purification.<br>
The compound of the formula XI is then treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O), which is generally employed in a slight excess of from about 1 to about 1.2 molar equivalents, in a solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, a mixture of two or more of such solvents or a mixture of one or more of such solvents with water, in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or alcoholate or a tertiary amine, such as sodium hydroxide or triethylamine, preferably at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 40°C, preferably at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 30°C to provide the Boc-protected amine of the formula XII.<br>
In a favorable manner, achieving simultaneous reduction of the olefinic double bond and removal of the benzyl group, the Boc-protected amine of the formula XII can then be treated with hydrogen at a pressure of from about 200 kPa to about 3000 kPa, in ; solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, 01 ethyl acetate, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example palladium on carbon or palladium hydroxide on carbon, for example Pearlman's catalyst, and an organic or inorganic acid, for example acetic acid, at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 40°C, to provide the corresponding piperidine of the formula VI as its salt with the employed acid. If desired, the salt can then be converted to the 4-[3-(tert-butoxycarbonylarninomethyl)phenyl]piperidine of the formula VI by treafrnent with a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or alcoholate.<br>
As indicated above, in the process for the preparation of the compounds of the formulae XII and VI according to the present invention many intermediates can advantageously be taken to the next reaction step, if desired, without a separate purification step and intermediary isolation.<br><br>
The 4-[3-{tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]piperidines useful as intermediates in the processes of the present invention also may be prepared by processes of the present invention, for example, as shown in Scheme 5.<br><br>
Scheme 5<br>
Accordingly, a 3-(4-pyridyl)benzaldehyde of the formula XIII is treated with hydroxytamine or a salt of hydroxylamine, for example hydroxylammonium chloride, sulfate or phosphate, in a solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, optionally in the presence of a base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate, or an alkati metal hydrogencarbonate such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 40°C, preferably at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 30°C, to provide the corresponding oxime of the formula XIV, or its salt. The solution of the oxime may be carried forward to the next step, if desired, without further purification.<br><br>
The oxime of the formula XIV or its salt, in a solvent, for example a polar organic solvent such as an aliphatic alcohol or a carboxylic acid, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or acetic acid, is then treated with hydrogen at a pressure of from about 300 kPa to about 1500 kPa, for example at about 500 kPa, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example palladium on carbon or palladium hydroxide, at a temperature of from about 20°C to about 50°C, for example at about 35°C, to provide the corresponding benzylamine of the formula XV, or its salt. Upon filtration to remove the catalyst, the solution may be used, if desired, without further purification for the next step.<br>
The benzylamine of the formula XV or its salt is then treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O), which is generally employed in a slight excess of from about 1 to about 1.2 molar equivalents, in a solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, a mixture of two or more of such solvents or a mixture of one or more of such solvents with water, in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or alcoholate or a tertiary amine, such as sodium hydroxide ortriethylamine, preferably at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 40°C, preferably at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 30"C, to provide the corresponding Boc-protected amine of the formula XVI, which may be used, if desired, without further purification for the next step.<br>
The 3-(4-pyridyl)benzylcarbamic acid tert-butyl ester of the formula XVI in a solvent, tor example an aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol, is then treated with hydrogen at a pressure of from about 2000 kPa to about 6000 kPa in the presence of a platinum catalyst, for example platinum on carbon or a platinum oxide, for example in the presence of 5% platinum on carbon, at a temperature of from about 20°C to about 80°C, for example at about 50°C, in the presence of an acid, for example a mineral acid such as hydrogen chloride or suifuric acid. In a surprising aspect of the present invention, the Boc-protecting group survives the presence of acid in the reduction mixture. When the absorption of hydrogen is complete, for work-up the<br><br>
solvent can be removed in vacuo, followed by treatment of the mixture with aqueous base, for example aqueous sodium hydroxide, and extraction into an organic solvent, for example dichloromethane or toluene. The residue upon evaporation of the solvent, if desired, may then be treated with an acid, for example p-totuenesulfonic acid, to provide the desired piperidine of the formula VI as its salt for example the salt with p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
As outlined above, instead of from a pyridylbenzaldehyde of the formula XIII, by converting it into the oxime and hydrogenating the oxime function, the amine of the formula XV or its salt can further be prepared from a pyridylbenzonitrile of the formula XVII by reducing the nitrite function, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium on charcoal or by means of a complex hydride reducing agent. The catalytic hydrogenation of the nitrile function is preferably performed in a solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol or a mixture of an aliphatic alcohol and water, at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 40°C, at a hydrogen pressure of from about 2000 kPa to about 6000 kPa, in the presence of an acid, for example a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid. The reduction of the nitrile function by means of a complex hydride is preferably performed in a solvent, such as a protic solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol like methanol or ethanol, when using a complex hydride like sodium borohydride, or an aprotic solvent, for example an ether like tetrahydrofuran, when using a complex hydride like lithium aluminium hydride, at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 50°C. The amine of the formula XV or its salt may be used, if desired, without further purification for the next step in which it is treated with dt-tert-butyl dicarbonate as explained above. The starting compounds of the formulae XIII and XVII are commercially available or can be prepared by or analogously to procedures described in the literature, for example in WO 98/21210, Z.Y. Wang et al., Chin. Chem. Lett. 2003, 14, pages 13-16, or MA Massa et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001,11, pages 1625-1628.<br>
As indicated above, in the processes for the preparation of a compound of the formula VI from a compound of the formula Xlll or XVII according to the present<br><br><br>
The first step of the previously described process, protection of the 4-piperidone derivative of the formula XXIV as the N-Teoc (2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl) derivative of the formula XXV, utilizing in situ generation of the carbamate formed from l,1'-carbonyldiimidazote (CDI) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethanol, requires a high vacuum distillation of the product at 156-160°C, as well as the use of the expensive reagent 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethanol. Enolization of the ketone of the formula XXV requires, at a temperature of -78aC, the reaction with lithium bis(trimethylsiiyl)amide in tetrahydrofuran, followed by quenching of the enolate with N-phenyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide), another very expensive reagent, to give the vinyl triflate of the formula XXVI. The triflate of the formula XXVI is used in a Suzuki coupling with the expensive reagent 3-cyanophenylboronic acid in the presence of the expensive catalyst tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium(O) to give the nitrite of the formula XXVIl which must be purified by chromatography. Hydrogenation of both the nitrite function and the double bond using Pd/C in the presence of hydrogen chloride gives a mixture of the desired amine hydrochloride of the formula XXVIIi ant the partially reduced nrtrile of the formula XXIX. The amine must be washed free of the nitrite and is then converted into the Boc-protected derivative of the formula XXX in the presence of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O). The residual nitrite of the formulj XXIX may be converted to the desired amine, and protected as the Boc derivative of the formula XXX in the presence of NiCl2, a toxic reagent, Boc2O, and NaBH4. The Boc derivative of the formula XXX must be isolated and further purified by trrturation with pentane, or it can alternatively be recrystaflized from cyclohexane/hexane. Removal of the N-Teoc group with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride at 50°C gives, after trituration with diethyl ether/pentane, the desired piperidine of the formula Via, i.e., the compound of formula VI wherein R1' is hydrogen.<br>
The prior art process of preparing the piperidine of the formula Via requires low temperature reaction conditions for one step, several chromatography and purification steps, isolation of intermediates, and the use of toxic and expensive reagents. Processes of the present invention, as described herein, provide the compounds of formula VI using less toxic and less expensive reagents, isolating fewer intermediates, and requiring fewer intermediate purification steps, thereby<br><br><br>
rendering these processes more suitable for the production of commercial quantities of such compounds under economical and technical aspects.<br>
The Invention is further explained and illustrated by the following exemplary procedures. These examples should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
