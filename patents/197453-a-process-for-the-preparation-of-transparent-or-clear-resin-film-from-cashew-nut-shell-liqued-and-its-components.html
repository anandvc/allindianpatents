				<td>The present invention provides a process for the preparation of transparent or clear resin film from cashew nut shell liquid and its components. As the resin prepared by the process of the present invention is transparent and gets dried to a solid film, it can be used as a base resin for the preparation of paints of all shades of colour for both interior and exterior decorations, industrial coatings, moreover as speciality coating in specific applications. So the industries to which this invention can be applied are paint industries, lacquers and varnishes, protective coatings, speciality surface coatings and related industries. The resin prepared by the process of the present invention can be processed into acrylate substrate for photoresist materials and so could be used in electronic industries.<br>
CNSL and resins based on the components of CNSL are generally brown or dark brown or black in colour and it is difficult to make transparent / clear or colourless resin from CNSL (C.K.S.Pillai, V.S. Prasad, J.D.Sudha, S.C.Bera and A.R.R.Menon, J.Appl.Polym.Sci., 41, 2487 (1990), A.R.R.Menon, C.K.S.Pillai, J.D.Sudha and A.G.Mathew, J.Scient.lnd.Res. , 44, 324 (1985)). Earlier attempts to blend resins resulting from CNSL and its components with phenolic resin succeeded only in partly removing its opaqueness and the resin still was coloured. There is no published literature regarding the production of any transparent resin from CNSL or its components. When cardanol was hydrogenated, the product obtained namely pentadecyl phenol is white in colour. However, when this material was converted to a resin by polycondensation with formaldehyde, the product was still coloured and the colour was difficult to remove. Apart from the above<br>
information, published literature or report orjpatent j on preparation of transparent or clear or colourless resin from CNSL and its components such as cardanol, cardol, anacardic acid or related compounds is not available. Since the colourless films produced from CNSL and its components find use in paints and lacquers and due to the great demands for such products, it was felt to develop a process for the preparation of colourless waterlike transparent films from CNSL and its components.<br>
The main object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of transparent clear/ colourless resin from CNSL or its components such as cardanol, anacardic acid, cardol.<br>
The main finding underlying the invention is our observation that acryloylation or methacryloylation of the hydroxyl group of the components present in CNSL such as cardanol/ anacardic acid/ cardol lead to free radically polymerizable acrylic or methacrylic monomers that on free radical polymerization yields polymers which on silica gel column separation gives resins of water like clarity and transparency which is colourless. The acrylate or methacrylate monomers obtained from CNSL and its components such as cardanol/ anacardic acid/ cardol by method of acryloylation or methacryloylation can also undergo copolymerisation with vinyl monomers such as acryl amide, acrylic acid, acrylo nitile, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxy ethylmetharylate and butyl acrylate to obtain copolymers that on separation by column chromatography give rise to transparent and clear resins without colour.<br>
The process of the present invention has essentially the following steps: (1) Acryloylation or methacryloylation of CNSL and its components such as cardanol, anacardic acid, cardol, (2) Purification of the monomers by column separation and (3) polymerization of the monomers using free radical initiators. The formulation of the paint can be made using any conventional formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
transparent or clear resin film from cashew nut shell liquid and its components<br>
which comprises reacting CNSL or its components such as cardanol, anacardic acid, cardol at ice bath temperature with acryloyl or methacryloyl chloride in the presence of a base and an organic solvent, distilling the crude product so obtained to get the monomer, subjecting the monomer to column chromatography then, polymerising the monomer with or without conventional comonomer in the presence of conventional free radical initiator and solvent at a temperature in the range of 70-80 째C over a period in the range of 20- 24 hrs. and evaporating the solvent to obtain a transparent, clear and colourless resin and if desired, adding known curing agents such as herein described and heated upto 75 to 85째C followed by drying to get a tough, transparent, clear and colourless film.<br>
The advantages of the present invention. The process produces a resin in the form of a film of water like clarity whereas the film obtained by the hithertoknown processes is coloured brown or dark brown. The film of resin obtained process is fully transparent and can not be scratched with a nail. It is the first time a fully transparent or water clear resin has been prepared from CNSL which is a dark brown coloured material. The film of the resin produced can be used directly for applications in surface coatings with shades of all coloures. The film of the resin obtained is also tough. The resin is compatible with the conventional pigments and hence the use of compatibilizers can be avoided. The resin undergoes proper blending with the additives and pigments and gives a paint with smooth flow and high glow. The new resin obtained by the process of the present invention can also be used in other applications such as in photo-resist material as substrate replacing the existing costly acrylate resin. The resin obtained by the process is acrylate based and as the side of the components of CNSL such as cardanol, anacardic acid, cardol possesses unsaturation, it can undergo - photo cross-linking.<br>
azobisisobutyro nitrile, benzoyl peroxide, terbutyl hydroperoxide, dicumine peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or similar peroxies. The solvents employed in the polymerisation step may be selected from toluene or tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide or dioxane or carbontetrachloride. If preparation of the films of the copolymers are desired during the polymerisation, appropriate comonomers such as acryl amide, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, and the like may be added to the mixture.<br>
