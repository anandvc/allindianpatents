				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to a specific cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide functioning as a cationic polymer which, when contained in a cosmetic composition, improves adhesion to hair and skin, exerts good conditioning effects, and achieves satisfactory finish free of rigidity after drying, and to a cosmetic composition, in particular, a hair treatment composition, containing the cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide.<br>
BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY <br>
[0002]   A hair treatment composition for hair cleansing contains a conditioning agent for reducing damage on tangled hair during washing and rinsing and for improving the feeling of hair after washing. Substances that yield conditioning effects must adsorb onto hairs; thus, cationic polymers having ionic adsorption ability are typically used as such substances. Among these polymers, cation-modified cellulose derivatives, cation-modified guar gum, and dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride derivatives have been widely used. For example, Patent Document discloses the use of a cation-modified cellulose derivative, which incorporates a quaternary nitrogen-containing group, in a shampoo or hair treatment composition. Patent Document 2 discloses cation-modified guar gum having a ratio of mannose (galactomannan polysaccharide) constituting the main chain to galactose constituting the side chain of 2:1, the cation modified guar gum being used as a cationic conditioning polymer in hair care products, such as shampoos, hair rinses, etc., together with insoluble, nonvolatile silicone to improve<br>
the appearance of hair. Patent Document 3 discloses a cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by depolymerizing a galactomannan polysaccharide, i.e., guar gum or locust bean gum, by decomposition with an enzyme or the like, followed by cationic modification. Patent Document 4 discloses the use of a cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by modifying a galactomannan polysaccharide, i.e., guar gum or locust bean gum, with a hydroxyalkyl group, followed by cation modification and depolymerization, in a hair treatment composition and a skin care composition. [0003]   However, these cation-modified polymers cause rigidity that is unsatisfactory for users after drying and insufficient conditioning effects during rinsing due to the ratio of the main chain to the side chain of the galactomannan poiysaccharide, structural differences caused by the presence or absence of hydroxyalkyl groups, and the difference in viscosity caused depolymerization. In order to overcome these problems, cation-modified locust beam gum and cation-modified tara gum are used. Patent Document 5 discloses use of cation-modified locust beam gum in a hair care product, such as a shampoo or rinse, etc. and reports improved conditioning effects during rinsing and less frictional feel and rigidity after drying in comparison with a product with a cation-modified guar gum. Non-patent Documentl discloses an example of a hair care product, such as a shampoo or conditioner, containing this cation-modified locust beam gum. Patent Document 6 discloses cation-modified tara gum is suitable as a component of a hair care product, such as a shampoo or rinse, or a skin care composition, such as body cleansing preparation, because it improves the foam quality and feeling.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]   Diversified fashion trends have increased the frequency of using hair colors and hair dyes, which significantly damage hair and require conditioning agents to achieve greater conditioning effects, in particular, to render smoothness to hair during the use. For the purpose of improving lack of conditioning effects at use and worse of use feeling which were caused by cation-modified cellulose derivatives, depolymerized cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharides, cation-modified guar gum, and the like, cation-modified locust bean gum and cation-modified tara gum have been invented by, respectively, cation-modifying locust gum and tara gum. However, when they are used to treat damaged hair, hair becomes tangled at the fingers during the rinsing and the finish after drying is rarely satisfactory. Moreover, when they are incorporated in skin care compositions, satisfaction of users (use feeling) is low and appearance is poor due to the presence of water-insoluble substances. MEANS TO SOLVE THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]   Under these circumstances, the inventors have conducted extensive investigations to search for a compound that can render improved smoothness to wet hair and improved finish after drying when the compound is contained in a hair treatment composition composed of the conventional cation-modified locust bean gum or a cation-modified tara gum and that can improve the foam quality and the feeling of skin after use when the compound is contained in a skin care composition. As a result, the inventors have found that a particular cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide has excellent conditioning effects, improves the smoothness of wet hair, enhances foam formation (lathering) and<br><br><br>
foam quality, and ensures the improvement of feeling when the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is contained in a cosmetic composition. This cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is prepared by introducing a particular amount of a quaternary nitrogen-containing group into a galactomannan polysaccharide (hereinafter also referred to as "purified galactomannan polysaccharide") which is obtained by purifying crude galactomannan polysaccharide, comprises a main chain composed of mannose units and a side chain composed of galactose units, and has a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1 and/or 3:1 and contains 80 wt% or more of galactomannan, and aqueous solution of which can form a gel with an aqueous solution of xanthan gum and/or carrageenan. The cation charge density of this cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide is within a particular range. MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
[0006]   Thus, the present invention relates to a cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by partially substituting hydroxyl groups of a purified galactomannan polysaccharide with a quaternary nitrogen-containing group of Formula (1), the purified galactomannan polysaccharide being prepared by purifyng a crude galactomannan polysaccharide, comprising a main chain composed of mannose units and a side chain composed of galactose units, and<br>
containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan: Chemical formula (1)<br>

(where R-\ and R2 each independently represent an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; R3 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms; X-represents an anion; n is either 0 or 1 to 30; and, when n is 1 to 30,<br><br>
represents a polymer residue of an alkylene oxide having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and forms a polyalkylene glycol chain composed of a single alkylene oxide and/or a polyalkylene glycol chain composed of two or more types of alkylene oxide), wherein the cation charge density derived from the quaternary nitrogen-containing group is in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 meq/g. An aqueous solution of the purified galactomannan polysaccharide can form a gel with an aqueous solution of xanthan gum and/or carrageenan. The purified galactomannan polysaccharide has a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1 and/or 3:1.<br>
[0007]  The inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide reduces water-insoluble matters in crude galactomannan polysaccharides, so that when the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is contained in a hair treatment composition, such as a shampoo or rinse, it can achieve conditioning effects superior to those achieved by hair treatment compositions containing the conventional cation-modified locust bean gum (hereinafter also referred to as "nonpurified cation-modified locust bean gum") and cation-modified tara gum (hereinafter referred to as "nonpurified cation-modified tara gum") prepared by cation-modifying locust bean gum and tara gum containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan. Moreover, the hair treatment composition containing the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide will yield excellent feeling after drying. When the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is contained in a skin care composition, foam formation and foam quality can be improved and good finish feel can be achieved. Thus, the present invention can provide a cosmetic composition that has excellent use feeling compared to conventional products.<br>
[0008]   One of galactomannan polysaccharides used in the present invention contains a main chain composed of mannose units and a side chain composed of galactose units and is a nonionic polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1. The galactomannan polysaccharide is a natural water-soluble gum<br><br><br>
obtained from albumens of seeds of locust bean (Ceratonia Siliqua), a perennial<br>
leguminous plant grown in Mediterranean regions and is commonly called "locust bean gum" or "carob gum". The present invention uses a purified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by purifying a crude galactomannan polysaccharide obtained from albumens of seeds of locust bean so that the galactomannan content is 80 wt% or more and preferably 83 wt% or more.<br>
[0009]  Another galactomannan polysaccharide used in the present invention contains a main chain composed of mannose units and a side chain composed of galactose units and is a nonionic polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1. This galactomannan polysaccharide is a natural water-soluble gum obtained from albumens of seeds of tara (Caesalpinia Spinosa), a leguminous plant native of the South American Andes, and is commonly called "tara gum". The present invention uses a purified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by purifying a crude galactomannan polysaccharide obtained from albumens of seeds of tara so that the galactomannan content is 80 wt% or more and preferably 83 wt% or more.<br>
[0010]  An example process for purifying crude galactomannan polysaccharide to increase the galactomannan content to 80 wt% or more includes dissolving crude galactomannan polysaccharide (hereinafter also referred to as "nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide") containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan in water to prepare an aqueous solution, filtering the aqueous solution to remove water-insoluble matters, precipitating the filtrate in an organic solvent, and drying the resulting precipitates. Alternatively, the purified galactomannan polysaccharide may be obtained by removing the shell portions of the seeds and milling only the cores of albumens left thereby. Although the crude galactomannan polysaccharide is purified by such conventional processes, the purifying process is not limited to these.<br>
[0011]   It is well known that locust bean gum having a mannose to galactose<br><br><br>
ratio of 4:1 and tara gum having a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1 have different properties, such as rheological properties, from those of guar gum having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2:1.<br>
[0012]  A cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention can be produced by reacting a galactomannan polysaccharide with a glycidyltrialkyl ammonium salt having a quaternary nitrogen-containing group or a 3-halogeno-2-hydroxypropyltrialkyl ammonium salt having a quaternary nitrogen-containing group, the galactomannan polysaccharide being prepared by purifying a crude galactomannan polysaccharide and containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan and having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1 (in such a case, the polysaccharide is referred to as "purified locust bean gum") or a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1 (in such a case, the polysaccharide is referred as "purified tara gum"). The galactomannan polysaccharide may be a mixture of the two gums. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent, preferably a hydrous alcohol, in the presence of an alkali. Such an introduction of a quaternary nitrogen-containing group can be conducted by known techniques, but the introduction process is not particularly limited. For example, the reaction between the galactomannan polysaccharide and the quaternary nitrogen-containing group of the glycidyltrialkyl ammonium salt or the 3-halogeno-2-hydroxypropyltrialkyl ammonium salt may be conducted after alkylene oxide having 2 to 4 carbon atoms are added to part of hydroxyl groups contained in a purified galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1, thereby yielding the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention (hereinafter, the cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1 is also referred to as" purified cation-modified locust bean gum). Moreover, in order to prevent aggregation of the purified locust bean gum in the solvent during the reaction, an inorganic salt, preferably sodium chloride, may be added to the reaction system. Moreover, in order to prevent<br><br><br>
aggregation of the purified locust bean gum, to enhance the dispersibility of the solute and to increase the rate of reaction, an alkali or inorganic salt may be dissolved or dispersed in the reaction solvent, and subsequently the purified locust bean gum may be added and dissolved or dispersed to introduce the quaternary nitrogen-containing group.<br>
[0013]  A galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1 and containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan (hereinafter also referred to as "purified tara gum") can be modified with cation by the same process as that for producing the purified locust bean gum described above to produce an inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide (hereinafter, the inventive cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1 is also referred to as "purified cation-modified tara gum").<br>
[0014]  Alternatively, a cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide containing 80 wt% more of galactomannan can be produced by removing water-insoluble matters, such as shells, by milling, classifying, or filtering a crude galactomannan polysaccharide containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan after the crude galactomannan polysaccharide was cation-modified by a similar process of the above-described process.<br>
[0015]  Alternatively, an inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide can be produced by cation-modifying a mixture of a purified locust bean gum and a purified tara gum by the same process employed for the purified locust bean gum.<br>
[0016]   In the present invention, a quaternary nitrogen-containing group represented by general formula (1) is introduced to a purified locust bean gum, i.e., a galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1, or a purified tara gum, i.e., a galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 3:1. Examples of R1 and R2 in the quaternary nitrogen-containing group include methyl, ethyl and propyl. Examples of R3, which is an<br><br>
alkyl group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, include methyl, ethyl, propyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl and dococyl. Examples of R4O include ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy. Examples of anion X- include halogen ions such as a chlorine ion, a bromine ion and an iodine ion, a methyl sulfate ion, an ethyl sulfate ion and an acetate ion.<br>
[0017]   By cation-modifying a purified galactomannan polysaccharide containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan, the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared exhibits adsorption to hair and skin, provides satisfactory smoothness, and is thus suitable as a component of cosmetic compositions. For example, when the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is contained in a hair treatment composition, finger-passing during hair-rinsing can be reduced and the finish feel after drying can be improved. If the inventive polysaccharide is contained in a skin care composition, e.g., a body cleansing preparation, the foam quality can be improved, and the feel of the skin to the feeling after use can be improved. Thus, the present invention is also directed to these cosmetic compositions containing the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide.<br>
[0018]  The cation charge density derived from the quaternary nitrogen-containing group in the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 meq/g, and preferably 0.5 to 2.5 meq/g. At a cation charge density of less than 0.1 meq/g, the adsorption of the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide to hair and skin will be insufficient; thus, a hair treatment composition or skin care composition, such as a shampoo, a conditioner, or a body cleansing preparation, containing this cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide will exhibit no improvement. A hair treatment composition or a skin care composition containing a purified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide having a charge density exceeding 3.0 meq/g will obstruct formation of foam and give stickiness and sliminess feel<br><br>
disagreeable for users during the use. Moreover, skin or hair after the treatment will be undesirably rigid and sticky.<br>
[0019]   Here, the "cation charge density" derived from the quaternary nitrogen-containing group in the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide refers to the equivalent weight of the quaternary nitrogen-containing group of Formula (1) per gram of the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide. In general, the nitrogen content derived from the quaternary nitrogen-containing group is determined by Kjeldahl analysis (The Japanese Standards of Cosmetic Ingredients, old edition, General Test Methods, Nitrogen Determination, Method 2), and the equivalent weight can be calculated from the observed nitrogen content. However, the purified galactomannan polysaccharide having a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1 or 3:1 used in the present invention contains nitrogen. The nitrogen content derived from the purified galactomannan polysaccharide must be subtracted from the observed nitrogen content of the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide to determine the nitrogen content derived from the quaternary nitrogen-containing group. For example, suppose an inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide, in which the quaternary nitrogen-containing group represented by formula (1) contains R1( R2, and R3 each representing methyl, X- representing chlorine ion, and n being zero, is prepared by introducing a cation to a purified locust bean gum, and the nitrogen content of that inventive polysaccharide is determined to be 2.16% by Kjeldahl analysis. In such a case, the cation charge density can be determined by the following equation (the purified locust bean gum used in the present invention usually contains about 0.90% of nitrogen): Equation 1<br>
cation charge density (meq/g) = (nitrogen content (%) derived from quaternary nitrogen-containing group x 1000)/(atomic weight of nitrogen (14.0) x 100)<br>
= (2.16-0.90)71.40 = 0.90  <br>
[0020]   The "galactomannan content" in the crude galactomannan polysaccharide refers to the mass percent of galactomannan contained per gram of a crude galactomannan polysaccharide, i.e., a natural water-soluble gum from which the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide is made, based on solid content. Although an example method of determining the galactomannan content by using absorbance after enzymic decomposition is given below, the method is not limited to this and may be a liquid chromatographic method, a thin-layer chromatographic method, or the like. A sample of about 20 mg is accurately weighted, placed in a centrifugal tube, and mixed with 5 mL of ethanol. The mixture is then incubated at 85°C to 95°C and separated by centrifugation into an upper phase and a lower phase. To the lower phase, 10.0 mL of a 50 mM acetic acid buffer solution (pH 4.5) is added, and the resulting mixture is heated and left to stand at 40°C for 12 hours. Subsequently, 20 // L of j3-mannanase is added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture is cultured at 40°C for 180 minutes. The mixture is then centrifuged and 0.1 mL of supernatant is sampled. The supernatant is mixed with 0.2 mL of a 50 mM acetic acid buffer solution (pH 4.5) and 20 /j, L of a -galactosidase. The resulting solution is incubated at 40°C and mixed with 2.5 mL of a 200 mM tris buffer solution and then with 0.1 mL of j3 -nicotineamide adeninedinucleotide (0.1 g/10 mL) and 8 p, L of galactose dehydrogenase. The resulting mixture is incubated at 40°C for 60 minutes. Subsequently, the absorbance of the solution at 340 nm is measured. The galactose content is then determined by the following equation from the observed absorbance (the galactomannan content is determined from the galactose content using the mannose to galactose ratio of the sample):<br><br>
Equation 2<br>
galactose content (%) = (E - E0) x (1/W) x A*<br>
E: absorbance at 340 nm (sample solution)<br>
E0: absorbance at 340 nm (blank)<br>
A*: conversion factor for determining galactose content<br>
W: sample-collecting amount (mg)<br>
[0021]  To be more specific, using a galactomannan assay kit produced by Biocon (Japan) Ltd., the galactomannan content in the purified locust bean gum used in the present invention is determined. Given that the conversion factor A* determined from the calibration curve is 1384.6, that the absorbance of the blank at 340 nm is 0.276, that 17.8 mg of the purified locust bean gum (based on solid content) is sampled, and that the absorbance of the sample solution at 340 nm is 0.502, the calculated galactose content is 17.6%. Since the locust bean gum has a mannose to galactose ratio of 4:1, the galactomannan content is 88.0%.<br>
[0022]   The inventive purified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide is particularly suitable as a component of a cosmetic composition. For example, a hair care composition containing the inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide will render improved smoothness to wet hair, achieve improved conditioning effect, and ensure a more satisfactory finish feel as compared with a hair treatment composition containing the conventional nonpurified cation-modified locust bean gum or the conventional nonpurified cation-modified tara gum prepared by cation-modifying an nonpurified locust gum or nonpurified tara gum containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan. Because nonpurified cation-modified locust bean gum and nonpurified tara gum contain water-insoluble matters in addition to galactomannan polysaccharide which is a natural water-soluble gum, skin care compositions containing the conventional gums do not have satisfactory feeling due to the presence of water-insoluble<br><br>
matters. In contrast, skin care compositions containing inventive cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide will not cause any lowering of feeling due to fewer water-insoluble matters by the purification and will produce satisfactory foaming. Thus, the present invention can provide a high quality skin care composition.<br>
[0023]  When the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention is contained in a hair treatment composition or a skin care composition, the content thereof is preferably 0.05 to 5 wt% relative to 100 wt% of the entire composition. At a content less than 0.5 percent by mass, its conditioning effects tend to be insufficient. At a content exceeding 5 wt%, the composition will give the user sliminess and stickiness feeling and degrade the smoothness, thereby causing the use feeling worse.<br>
[0024]  To a hair treatment composition of the present invention, a cationic water-soluble polymer or amphoteric water-soluble polymer may be added, in addition to a cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide, in order to further enhance the conditioning effect of the composition. However, the amount of the additional polymer added should be adjusted so as not to interfere with the emulsifiability and soft texture to hair of a cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide used in combination. The amount in question added is preferably 5% by weight or lower, with respect to the weight (100% by weight) of the entire composition. If the amount added exceeded the above range, the membrane-forming activity and hair-setting performance of a cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide used in combination would be impaired.

(Evaluation)<br>
[0052]   Strands of hairs (manufactured by BEAULAX CO., LTD.; artificial hairs the roots of which were arranged uniformly; 60 mm in length and 40 mm in width) were immersed in 5% aqueous solutions of shampoo of the test prescriptions S1 to S4 prepared in the above sections 6-a to 6-b (present invention). After the shampoo was fully wahsed away, coefficient of dynamic friction was measured with respect to the hairs which were in wet-state as they were, by using a friction-sensing tester (KES-SE manufactured by KATO TECH CO., LTD.) to evaluate smoothness. The evaluation result is shown in Table 3. Strands of haris were similarly immpersed in shampoo of the comparative prescriptions C1 and C2 prepared in the above section 6-c. After the shampoo was fully wahsed away, coefficient of dynamic friction of the strands of hairs was measured with respect to the hairs which were in wet-state of hairs as they were, by the friction-sensing tester to evaluate smoothness. The result is shown in Table 3.<br>
[0053]  With respect to the shampoo of test prescriptions S1 to S4 prepared in the above sections 6-a to 6-c and the shampoo of the comparative prescriptions C1 and C2, ten testers carried out finger-passing text after hair-washing.   After they washed and rinsed their hairs by using the shampoo of test prescriptions S1 to S4 and the shampoo of the comparative prescriptions C1 and C2 so as to determine finger-passing at rinsing time. Each of the prescriptions tested was ranked depending on the numbers of testers who gave good finger-passing according to the following four rank scale. The result is shown in Table 3.<br>
© — The number of positive testers who felt good finger-passing is eight or more.<br>
O - The number of positive testers who felt good finger-passing is six to seven.<br>
A -- The number of positive testers who felt good finger-passing is four to five.<br>
x - The number of positive testers who felt good finger-passing is three or less.<br>
TABLE 3. Comparison of smoothness in<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
[0054]   From the result shown in Table 3, it was confirmed that the shampoos containing the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention descended coefficient of dynamic friction in wet hairs in comparison with the shampoos containing the conventional cation-modified nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharides.   This appears in organoleptic evaluation and it was confirmed that the shampoos of the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention indicated excellent finger-passing after hair-washing in comparison with the shampoos containing the conventional cation-modified nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharides. Moreover, it is recognized that the above-mentioned effects were not lost even in the shampoos used in combination of cation-modified water-soluble polymer or amphoteric water-soluble polymer. It was confirmed that smoothness was improved by cation-modifying purified galactomannan polysccharide containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan. Furthermore, since the improvement of smoothness to hairs was recognized, improvement of feeling to skin cosmetic compositions such as body cleansing agent, facial cleanser, etc. Example 7.   Smoothness to hairs (Part 2)<br>
[0055]   The smoothness affording effect on the damaged hairs by the cation-modified galactomannan purified polysaccharide of the present invention was tested in water-rinse hair cleansing preparations using shampoos containing the test prescriptions S1 to S4 of the present invention and comparative prescriptions C1 to C2 prepared in Example 6. The same strands of hairs as the one used in Example 6 were immersed in a bleaching solution which comprised a 6% H2O2 and 3% aqueous ammonium at 2:1 (w/w): the hair strand was immersed for 60 minutes in the bleaching solution whose weight against that of the hair strand was adjusted to 100:1 and whose temperature was kept at 40°C. The hair strand was rinsed with warm water, and dried with a dryer. The strands of hairs which had been seriously damaged by being immersed in the bleaching solution were immersed in aqueous 5% solution of shampoo containing the test prescriptions S1 to S4 of the present invention prepared in the above sections   6-a to 6-b. After shampoo was fully washed away, coefficient of dynamic friction was measured with respect to the hairs which were in wet-state as they are by using a friction-sensing tester to evaluate smoothness. The evaluation result is shown in Table 4. Strands of haris were similarly immpersed in shampoo of the comparative prescriptions C1 and C2 prepared in the above section 6-c. After the shampoo<br>
was fully wahsed away, coefficient of dynamic friction was measured with respect to the hairs which were in wet-state of hairs as they were by the friction-sensing tester to evaluate smoothness. The result is shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4   Smoothness affording effect to damaged hairs in water-rinse hair cleansing preparation<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0056]   From the result shown in Table 4, it was confirmed that even in the damaged hairs, the prescriptions containing cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide obtained by cation-modifying purified galactomannan polysacchaide containing 80 wt% or more of galactomannan were excellent in effect of improving smoothness to damaged hairs in wet in comparison with prescriptions containing nonpurified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide. Moreover, the difference of coefficient of dynamic friction was become greater than the case evaluated in normal hairs which were not treated by bleaching solution in Example 6, and accordingly, it was confirmed that the present invention was useful to damaged hairs. Example 8.   Foaming test<br>
[0057]   Foaming activities were tested by using shampoos containing the test prescriptions S1 to S4 of the present invention prepared in the above sections 6-a to 6b of Example 6. For the comarison, foaming activities were similarly tested by using the comparative prescriptions C1 to C2 prepared in the above section 6-c of Example 6.<br>
[0058]   Testing procedures were as follows.   A 175-ml sample of a 1.5% aqueous solution of each preparation shampoo of the prescriptions S1 to S4 of the present invention and of the comparative prescriptions C1 and C2. They were transmerred to a commercially available juice-mixer where it was spun to develop bubbles. The foam amount was plotted as a function of spun time. The results are shown in Table 5.Table 5     <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
[0059]   From the result shown in Table 5, it was proved that the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides of the present invention were excellent in foaming activity in comparison with the conventional nonpurified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide. Accordingly, when the present invention is contained in a cosmetic composition having foam formation (lathering) such as a shampoo, body cleansers, facial cleansers, etc., foaming improvement can be expected.<br>
[0060]   In the following, improvement of smoothness, good foam-forming performance and feeling improvement which were obtained by the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide applied to normal hairs and damaged hairs were confirmed in various cosmetic compositions having different formulations.<br>

[0061]   The cation-modified galactomannan purified polysaccharides prepared in Examples 1 to 5 and named Samples 1-9 were used to prepare shampoo samples with compositions as shown in column (A) of Table 6. The shampoo sample was prepared as follows. Distilled water (ingredient (14)) in column (A) of Table 6 was heated to 65°C to which one of the test Samples (ingredient (1)) was slowly added with stirring, and mixture was stirred until it was dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, heating was discontinued, and polyoxyethylene(1,5)lauryl ether sulfuric acid triethanol amine (ingredient (5)), polyoxyethylene(3)lauryl ether sulfuric acid sodium (ingredient (6)), coconut oil fatty acid amide propylbetaine (ingredient (7)), coconut oil fatty acid monoethanol amide (ingredient (8)), dipropylene glycol (ingredient (9)) and ethylene glycol distearate (ingredient (10)) were added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid, to which sodium edetate (ingredient (11)), sodium benzoate (ingredient (12)), and an aqueous solution of citric acid (for pH adjustment, pH 5.5-6.0)(ingredient (13)) were added, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity. Thus, five kinds of shampoo samples with compositions as shown under column (A) of Table 6 were obtained. The five shampoo samples containing the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides represented by Samples 1-9 were named test prescriptions 1-9 of the present invention, respectively. 9-b<br>

To this test sample, ingredients shown under column (B) of Table 6 were added and the resulting product was used as a test shampoo sample. Specifically, distilled water (ingredient (14)) was heated to 65°C to which Sample 1 (ingredient (1)) and cationic water-soluble polymer A or B (ingredient (3)) were slowly added with stirring at the weight ratios specified in column (B) of Table 6. The stirring was continued until the substances added were dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, heating was discontinued, and the ingredients (5) to (10) were added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid, to which ingredients (11) to (13) were further added at 30 to 40°C, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity. A shampoo sample with a composition as shown under column (B) of Table 6 was obtained. This was named test prescription 10. 9-c<br>
[0063]  The same procedures as in the above section 9-b were employed except that a copolymer of diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride and acryl amide (Merquat 550, Nalco) was used instead of the cation-modified water-soluble polymer A, to provide a shampoo sample with a composition as shown under column (C) of Table 6. This was named test prescription 11. 9-d<br>
[0064]   The cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared in Example 1 and named Sample 1 and a copolymer of N-methacryloyloxyethyl N,N-dimethyl ammonium-a-methylcarboxylbetaine and alkyl methacrylate (Yukaformer SM, Mitsubishi Chemicals Co.) as an amphoteric water-soluble polymer were combined at the weight ratio specified in Table 6, and used as a test sample. To this test sample, ingredients shown under column (D) of Table 6 were added and the resulting product was used as a test shampoo sample. Specifically, distilled<br><br><br>
water (ingredient (14)) was heated to 65°C to which one of Samples 1 to 5 (ingredient (1)) and the amphoteric water-soluble polymer (ingredient (4)) were slowly added with stirring at the weight ratios specified in column (D) of Table 6. The stirring was continued until the substances added were completely dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, heating was discontinued, and the ingredients (5) to (10) were added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid. Ingredients (11) to (13) were added to the mixture kept at 30 to 40°C, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity.

To this test sample, ingredients shown under column (E) of Table 6 were added and the resulting product was used as a test shampoo sample. Specifically, distilled water (ingredient (14)) under (E) of Table 6 was heated to 65°C to which one of Samples 1 to 5 (ingredient (1)), the cationic water-soluble polymer A or B (ingredient (3)), and the amphoteric water-soluble polymer (ingredient (4)) were slowly added with stirring at the weight ratios specified in column (E) of Table 6. The stirring was continued until the substances added were dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, heating was discontinued, and the ingredients (5) to (10) were added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid. Ingredients (11) to (13) were added to the mixture at 30-40°C, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity. A shampoo sample with a composition as shown under column (E) of Table 6 was obtained. This was named test prescription 13. 9-f (Preparation of comparative prescriptions)<br>
[0066]  To compare the effects of the test shampoo preparations containing the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention, comparative shampoo samples were prepared by using the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides prepared in Supplement 1 and listed in Table 1 under the names Samples 10 and 11. The composition of the comparative shampoo samples was as shown under column (G) of Table 6. Specifically, distilled water (ingredient (14)) was heated to 65°C to which Samples 10, 11, 12 or 13 (ingredient (2) in column (G) of Table 6) was slowly added with stirring. The stirring was continued until the substance added was dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, heating was discontinued, and the ingredients (5) to (10) were added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid. Ingredients (11) to (13) were added to the mixture at 30 to 40°C, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity. The shampoo samples thus obtained were named comparative prescriptions 1 and 2. 9-g (Preparation of comparative prescriptions)<br>
[0067]  To further compare effects, shampoos having the composition shown under comparative prescription (G) in Table 6 were prepared in similairty with the above section 9-f by using, instead of cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide in the above section 9-f, cation-modified nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide in which cation-modifying nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan was cation-modified, i.e., Samples 12 and 13 in Table 1 which were obtained in Comparative Example 1. The obtained products were named as comparative prescriptions 3 and 4.<br>
TABLE 6. Prescription of Shampoo Preparations<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0068]   To further compare the effects with other cationic, a comparative shampoo sample was prepared by using, instead of the cation-modified nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide in the above section 9-f, a cation-modified guar gum, in which the composition ratio of mannose and galactose is 2 : 1 though it is the same galactomannan polysaccharide, containing nitrogen at 1.9<br><br>
wt% (Catinal CG-100, Toho Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). The ingredients shown under column (G) of Table 6 were treated in the same manner as described in the above section 9-f to provide the comparative shampoo preparation which was named comparative prescription 5.<br>
(Evaluation) Example 10<br>
[0069]   In this test, test prescriptions 1 to 13 prepared as described in the above sections 9-a to 9-e, and a reference prescription were used. The reference prescription with a composition as shown under column (F) of Table 6 was obtained by using ingredients similar to those used for the production of test and comparative prescriptions and treating them similarly, except that they did not contain any cationic polymer.<br>
[0070] Of test prescriptions 1 to 13, and the reference prescription, ten testers washed their hair using each of the prescriptions, and dried the hair with a dryer. The testers compared the conditioning effects of the respective test prescriptions as described below during and after use with those of the reference prescription. The conditioning effects compared consisted of:<br>
*	foam-formation (lathering) at washing<br>
*	smoothness during use (finger-passing and feeling of hair)<br>
*	comb-passing feeling after use (dried hairs).<br>
The tester's evaluation was scored according to the following five rank scale. For each of the test prescriptions, the scores of the ten testers were summed as in shown in Table 7, and the sum of ten testers' evaluation was taken as its overall evaluation result. The evaluation results of the test prescriptions are shown in Table 8. The reference prescription (F) was prepared in such a manner that distilled water (ingredient (14)) was heated to 65°C to which the ingredients (5) to (10) were added. The mixture was stirred until it became a uniform liquid. To the<br><br><br>
mixture which was cooled to 30 to 40°C, ingredients (11) to (13) were added, and the mixture was stirred to homogeneity.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
[0071]  With regard to comparative prescriptions 1 to 5 prepared as described in 9-f to 9-h, their conditioning effects were compared with those of the reference prescription in the same manner as in Example 10. The thus obtained evaluation results of comparative prescriptions 1 to 5 are shown in Table 8.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
[0072]   From the results of Table 8, it was confirmed that when the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides of the present invention prepared by cation-modifying purified galactomannan polysaccharide were added to a shampoo preparation, foam-formation (lathering) at washing hairs was improved and conditioning effects such as finger-passing and feeling during use were superior, and conditioning effects of comb-passing after hair-dried were superior.<br>
[0073]   On the other hand, the comparative prescriptions 3 and 4 containing samples 12 and 13 prepared by cation-modifying nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide were worse in conditioning effects such as "finger-passing at washing", etc. in comparison with the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides of the present invention, and were poor in smoothness and finish-feeling after use. From these facts, it was shown that the performance was improved by the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharides of the present invention prepared by cation-modifying purified galactomannan polysaccharide containing 80 wt% or more of galacttomannan. Moreover, by using, together, a cationic water-soluble polymer (Catinal HC-100, Merquat 550) and/or an amphoretic water-soluble polymer (Yukaformer SM) as the compounding ingredients, the conditioning effects of the test prescriptions were found to be enhanced without disturbing the performance possesed by the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention. It was confirmed that when the test prescriptions are compared with the comparative prescription 5 which contains a cationic polymer (cation-modified guar gum: Catinal CG-100) prepared by cation-modifying galactomannan polysaccharide in which composite ratio of mannose and galactose is 2 : 1, the present invention surpassed in both "during use" and "after use" and confered smoothness at wasing hairs and finish-feeling after hair dry which the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention has, in<br>
comparison with the conventional conditioning agents which have not such smoothness and finish-feeling. (Exemplary shampoo compositions 1-5)<br>

TABLE 16. Evaluation Results of Rinse Preparations<br>
(Table Removed)<br>

Moreover, since comb-pasing after drying hairs was improved and conditioning effects such as less frictional feel enabled to be obtained, it was confirmed good finish feel by the present invention in the systems containing an amideamine<br>
compound, neutralizer and higher alcohol. [0092]   Furthermore, when the performance of the test hair rinse preparations<br>
(Test prescriptions 14 to 20) containing the amideamine compound, neutralizer and higher alcohol were compared with nonpurified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharides prepared by cation-modifying nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan (Comparative prescriptions 8 to 9) of the Samples 12 and 13, it was confirmed that the present compositions were excellent in both conditioning effects during use and finish feel after use. This means that the catinon-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention reduces precipitates derived from outer cover, proteins and water-unsoluble substances in comparison with the conventional nonpurified cation-modified galactomannan polysaccharide prepared by cation-modifying nonpurified galactomannan polysaccharide containing less than 80 wt% of galactomannan, whereby good smoothness during rinse treatment was obtained and at the same time, finish feel after use enabled to be improved. Moreover, it was confirmed that by using, together, cationic water-soluble polymer and/or amphoeric water-soluble polymer, the conditioning effects of the test prescriptions were found to be enhanced without disturbing the performance possessed by the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention. Furthermore, it was confirmed that by containing silicone such as methylpolysiloxane, etc., conditining effects enabled to be improved without disturbing the performance possessed by the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention.<br>

Body Cleansing Preparation (Preparation) Example 15 15-a<br>
[0114]  The cation-modified cation-modified purified galactomannan polysacchardie prepared in Examples 1, 2 and 5, and named Samples 1, 4 and 7 were used to prepare body cleansing samples (body soaps) whose composition was as shown in column (A) of Table 28 below. Specifically, distilled water (ingredient (11)) was heated to 60°C, to which one of the test Samples 1, 4 and 7 (ingredient (1)) was added with stirring, and the mixture was further stirred until it became a uniform solution. Then, ingredients (3) to (7) were added to the solution at 50 to 60°C with stirring and the mixture was further stirred until it was completely dissolved.   Similarly, ingredients (8) to (10) were added to the mixture at 30-40°C with stirring and dissolved to homogeneity. Thus, three kinds of body cleansing samples with compositions as shown under column (A) of Table 28<br>
were obtained. The three body cleansing samples containing the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide represented by Samples 1, 4 and 7 were named test prescriptions 23, 24 and 25, respectively.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
15-b (Preparation of comparative prescription)<br>
[0115]   To compare the effects of the cation-modified purified galactomannan polysaccharide of the present invention with those of a conventional cationic polymer in body cleansing preparations, the Sample 12 obtained in the Comparative Example 1 and another comparative body cleansing samples as other cationic polymer were prepared by using a cation-modified hydroxyethyl cellulose containing nitrogen at 1.8 wt% into which an average of 1.8 mol of ethylene oxide was introduced (Catinal HC-100, Toho Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), and adding thereto ingredients specified under column (C) of Table 28. Specifically, distilled water (ingredient (11)) was heated to 60°C, to which Catinal<br>
HC-100 (ingredient (2)) was slowly added with stirring and dissolved. After recognizing the dissolution, ingredients (3) to (7) were added to the solution at 50 to 60°C with stirring and the mixture was further stirred until it was dissolved to homogeneity. Then, ingredients (8) to (10) were added to the solution at 30 to 40°C with stirring in the same manner as above, until they were dissolved to homogeneity. Thus, body cleansing samples with a composition as shown under column (C) of Table 28 were obtained. The samples were named comparative prescriptions 11 and 12.<br>
(Evaluation) Example 16<br>
[0116]   In this test, test prescriptions 23, 24 and 25 prepared as described in the above section 15-a and a reference prescription were used. The reference prescription had a composition as shown under column (B) of Table 28, the reference prescription containing no high polyer such as cationic polymer, etc. in this ingredients.<br>
[0117]   Each of the test prescriptions was used by ten testers to wash their body. The testers evaluated the performance of the test prescriptions as compared with the reference prescription with special attention being paid to: *foam amount and foam quality during use, *use feeling during use (easy rinsing, no tautness and sliminess after rinsing), and<br>
*use feeling after use (after dried) (no tautness, smoothness, and moist feeling).<br>
The tester's evaluation was scored according to the following five rank scale. [0118]   For each of the test prescriptions, the scores of the ten testers were summed in Tables 29 and 30 and the sum was taken as its overall evaluation result by the system sthon in Table 31.<br>
[0119]   Distilled water (ingredient (11)) was heated to 60°C, to which ingredients (3) to (7) were added at 50 to 60°C with stirring and dissolved to homogeneity. To the resulting solution at 30 to 40°C ingredients (8) to (10) were added with stirring and the mixture was further stirred until it was completely dissolved. Thus, a body cleansing sample with a composition as shown under column (B) of Table 28 was obtained. The sample was used as a reference in this test.<br>
