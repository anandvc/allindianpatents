NEW PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmacologically active benzofused five-membered<br>
heterocycles, or pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts and esters thereof, as well as to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use as inhibitors of catechol-O-<br>
methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is generally known and accepted in the art that COMT inhibitors are useful in the<br>
treatment of Parkinson's disease. COMT inhibitors have been shown to be effective in<br>
clinical use for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa therapy. In<br>
order to achieve a steady plasma concentration of levodopa, it is desirable that the COMT<br>
inhibitor has a good bioavailability and a long duration of action. However, the<br>
commercially available COMT inhibitors are associated with a rather short duration of<br>
action and their oral bioavailability is limited.<br>
COMT inhibitors have also been indicated to be useful in the treatment of, for example,<br>
hypertension, heart failure and depression (cf. e.g. US 5,446,194) as well as inhibitors for<br>
the prevention of diabetic vascular dysfunctions (cf. US 6,207,706). COMT inhibitors have<br>
also been disclosed as being useful for treating or controlling pain (cf. US 6,723,754) as<br>
well as for treating restless legs syndrome (RLS), which is also known as Ekbom's<br>
syndrome (cf. WO 2006/051154). RLS is characterized by an irresistible urge to move the<br>
legs accompanied by other unpleasant sensations deep within the legs.<br>
Some compounds with COMT inhibiting activity are known in the art. For example,<br>
catechol derivatives as COMT inhibitors have been disclosed e.g. in US 5,389,653; US<br>
5,446,194; US 6,150,412; US 6,512,136; WO 01/98250; WO 01/98251; WO 02/02548; US<br>
6,903,114, WO 2004/112729 and WO 2005/058228. Isoflavone derivatives as COMT<br>
inhibitors have been disclosed in US 3,973,608.<br><br>
2<br>
As to known benzofiised five-membered heterocycles, 2-ben2yl-7-bromo-6-nitro-<br>
benzofuran-4,5-diol has been disclosed in Lyubchanskaya et al. Khimiko-Farmatsevticheskii<br>
Zhurnal, 23 (1989) 843.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide further inhibitors of catechol-O-<br>
methyltransferase enzyme that can be used for the treatment of diseases or conditions<br>
wherein inhibition of COMT is indicated to be useful. Accordingly, an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide further compounds to be used as COMT inhibiting agents in the<br>
treatment of mammals, including humans and animals. Furthermore, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing the present compounds are provided.<br>
Due to slow ehmination via glucuronidation, the COMT inhibitors of the present invention<br>
have an improved bioavailability and/or a prolonged duration of action. Additionally, the<br>
compounds of the present invention possess enhanced primary pharmacological properties,<br>
i.e. COMT inhibiting activity. Furthermore, the compounds do not uncouple oxidative<br>
phosphorylation and thus possess a desirable safety profile.<br>

The compounds of formula I can be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes analogously to<br>
or according to methods known in the literature using suitable starting materials.<br>
Benzofuran derivatives can be prepared, for example, according to reaction scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br>
11<br>
lii scheme 1 the methoxy substituents are in a position ortho to each other, R4 is as defined<br>
above and in a position ortho to either the acyl substituent or the hydroxy substituent in<br>
formula II, and R5 is as defined above. An acylphenol compound is alkylated with a<br>
functionalized haloderivative at room temperature in the presence of a suitable base in a<br>
suitable solvent, e.g. potassium carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide or sodium hydride in<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The activated methylene group is condensed with the carbonyl by using a<br>
suitable base, e.g. sodium ethanolate. In addition to the carbethoxy group, the methylene<br>
group can be activated with any methylene activating group like nitro, cyano, acyl, aryl,<br>
aryloxy, alkylthio, or arylthio. The carbethoxy group can then be converted to other<br>
functional groups, if desired.<br>
The preparation of benzofuran derivatives is further exemplified in Example 18.<br>
2,3-Dihydro-isoindol-l-one derivatives can be prepared, for example, according to reaction<br>
scheme 2:<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
12<br>
In scheme 2 the methoxy substituents are in a position ortho to each other, R4 is as defined<br>
above and in a position ortho to either the methoxycarbonyl substituent or the CBrRsR^-<br>
substituent in formula V, and R5, R6, and R7 are as defined above. The ring is formed by<br>
refluxing a compound of formula V with an amine in a suitable solvent, e.g. toluene.<br>
The preparation of 2,3-dihydro-isoindol-l-one derivatives is further exemplified in Example<br>
1.<br>
Benzothiazole derivatives can be prepared, for example, according to scheme 3:<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
In scheme 3 the methoxy substituents are in a position ortho to each other, R4 is as defined<br>
above and in a 4- or 7-position in formula VHI, and R5 is, for example, aryl or heteroaryl.<br>
The ring is formed by refluxing an aniline with an aldehyde and elementary sulfur in a<br>
suitable solvent, e.g. dimethyl acetamide.<br>
The preparation of benzothiazole derivatives is further exemplified in Examples 3,15 and<br>
25.<br>
Benzo[6]thiophene derivatives can be prepared, for example, according to reaction scheme<br>
4:<br>
Scheme 4<br><br><br>
13<br>
In scheme 4 the methoxy substituents are in a position ortho to each other, R4 is as defined<br>
above and in a 4- or 7-position in formula XI, and R5' is, for example, (Ci-Cg)aIk:oxy,<br>
N-containing heterocyclyl or (Rg^N-, wherein Rg is as defined above. A benzaldehyde is<br>
condensed with malonic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. pyridine, resulting in an acrylic acid<br>
derivative. The ring is formed by reacting the acid with thionyl chloride in a suitable<br>
solvent, e.g. chlorobenzene or toluene.<br>
Another route for preparing benzo[6]thiophene derivatives is illustrated in scheme 5:<br>
Scheme 5<br><br><br>
14<br>
In scheme 5 the methoxy substituents are in a position ortho to each other. A benzaldehyde<br>
is condensed with rhodanine XII in a suitable solvent, e.g. a carboxylic acid such as acetic<br>
acid, resulting in intermediate XEI With the aid of a suitable base, e.g. sodium hydroxide,<br>
the intermediate is converted into a 2-mercapto-acrylic acid derivative. The ring is formed<br>
by treating the mercapto compound with, for example, iodine in a suitable solvent, e.g.<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The carboxy group can then be converted to other functional groups, if<br>
desired.<br>
The preparation of benzo[&amp;]thiophene derivatives is further exemplified in Examples 4-14,<br>
16-17,20-21, and 26-35.<br>
The dealkylation of the resulting dialkoxy intermediates as well as the insertion of the<br>
substituent Ri being cyano or nitro is described in the specific compound examples.<br>
It is obvious for a person skilled in the art that any starting material or intermediate in the<br>
reactions described above can be protected, if necessary, in a manner well known in the<br>
chemical field. Any protected functionality can subsequently be deprotected in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
The synthetic routes described above are meant to illustrate the preparation of the<br>
compounds of formula I and the preparation is by no means limited thereto, i.e. there are<br>
also other possible synthetic methods which are within the general knowledge of a person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be converted, if desired, into their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or ester form using methods well known in the art.<br>

As already mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds of formula I show interesting<br>
pharmacological properties, namely they exhibit an enhanced catechol-O-methyltransferase<br>
(COMT) enzyme inhibiting activity and have an improved bioavailability and/or a<br>
prolonged duration of action due to slow elimination via glucuronidation. Furthermore, they<br>
do not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Said properties are demonstrated with the<br>
pharmacological tests presented below.<br>
EXPERIMENT 1: Determination of COMT inhibiting activity in vitro<br><br>
51<br>
The Kj values were determined by measuring the COMT activity with various drug<br>
concentrations using recombinant human soluble form of COMT (hS-COMT). hS-COMT<br>
was preincubated with 25 uM S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and COMT inhibitor in 100<br>
lM Na2HP04 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 uM MgCl2 for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was<br>
started by adding the substrate esculetin (10 uM). The production of O-methylated esculetin<br>
was measured as time-resolved fluorescence (excitation at 355 nm, emission at 460 nm)<br>
using a FlexStation fiuorometer (Molecular Probes, USA). The assay was performed on 96-<br>
well plates. The tight binding inhibition constant, Kj, was resolved from the reaction kinetics<br>
observed at varying inhibitor concentrations using PlateKi software (BioKin, USA).<br>
The results are shown in Table 1. The results show that the compounds of formula I are<br>
capable of inhibiting COMT activity in vitro with an efficacy better than or equal to<br>
entacapone.<br><br>

EXPERIMENT 2: Determination of metabolic stability in vitro<br>
The metabolic stability was studied by incubating the compounds together with human liver<br>
microsomes (Human Biologies Inc.) using uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA,<br>
Sigma) as a cofactor. The incubation was carried out in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)<br>
containing 5 mM MgCl2. The final test substance concentration was 100 uM and the<br>
microsomal protein amount was 0.4 mg/ml. After 5 min preincubation the reaction was<br>
started with pre-warmed UDPGA, final concentration 5 mM. The mixture was incubated in<br>
Eppendorf tubes for 60 min at 37°C, and the reaction was terminated either by adding<br>
methanol or perchloric acid / methanol (1:9) mixture. After protein precipitation the<br><br>
52<br>
glucuronide formed was separated by high-perfonnance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The area of the glucuronide in the HPLC chromatogram was compared to that formed from<br>
entacapone in the same experimental conditions to obtain a relative glucuronidation value<br>
for each compound.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2. The results show that the compounds of formula I possess<br>
increased metabolic stability compared to entacapone in respect of glucuronidation.<br>
Glucuronidation has been shown to be the major elimination route of entacapone and thus<br>
the compounds of formula I have an improved bioavailability and/or a prolonged duration of<br>
action.<br><br>

EXPERIMENT 3: Determination of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in vitro<br>
Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was studied in isolated rat liver mitochondria<br>
measuring the oxygen consumption by a fluorescent technique.<br>
The mitochondrial preparations were made as described in Nissinen et al. European Journal<br>
of Pharmacology, 340 (1997) 287. Shortly, a rat was decapitated, liver was excised, washed<br>
in ice cold 0.9 % NaCl and cut into pieces. The tissue was placed into 40 ml of<br>
homogenization buffer containing 2 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 0,1 mM EDTA pH 6.8<br>
(1:4 w/vol) and homogenized with 5-20 strokes (800 rpm) in a medium-fitting Tefion-in-<br>
glass Braun homogenizator. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C.<br>
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 8200 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant<br>
was discarded and the pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of homogenization buffer. The<br>
suspension was centrifuged at 8200 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and<br>
the pellet was suspended into 2 ml of homogenization buffer and kept in ice until use (up to<br>
2-6 hours). The protein concentration was measured.<br><br>
53<br>
BD™ oxygen Biosensor 96 microweU plates were used for measuring oxygen consumption<br>
of mitochondria. The microweU plate has an oxygen sensitive fluorescent compound (Tris<br>
l,7-diphenyl-l,10-phenanthroline ruthenium(II) chloride) embedded in the gas permeable<br>
bottom of the well. Oxygen inhibits dye's fluorescence so the oxygen consumption of<br>
mitochondria is detected as an increase in fluorescence.<br>
The test compounds were added into the assay plate at various final concentrations (1,2.5,<br>
5,10,25, 50 /iM). A known uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,<br>
dinitrophenol (DNP; 10 JJM), was used as a reference compound (cf. Hemker Biochimica et<br>
Biophysica Acta, 81 (1964) 1, Nissinen et al. European Journal of Pharmacology, 340<br>
(1997) 287). The control contained only 2% DMSO. A stock solution of mitochondria (0.72<br>
ml = 4 mg/protein/ml) was added into 2.28 ml of respiratory buffer (37 °C) containing 250<br>
mM saccharose, 5 mM Na2HP04,2 mM MgCk, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM sodium succinate and<br>
10 mM MOPS pH 7.0. The measurement was started with the addition of the mitochondrial<br>
suspension (50 jtd/weH) to the wells. The plate was stirred for 20 s and the fluorescence in<br>
the wells was measured for 10 min using 9 s interval, excitation at 485 nm, emission at 630<br>
run and emission cut off at 610 nm. The photomultiplier tube sensitivity option was set to<br>
"low".<br>
The slope factor of each oxygen consumption measurement was determined. The means of<br>
two replicates were divided by the means of six control values, and the threshold values of<br>
uncoupling were determined for the compounds. The DNP/Control ratios describe the<br>
activity of mitochondria.<br>
If a sample/Control slope ratio exceeded 2, it was interpreted as uncoupling of oxidative<br>
phosphorylation. As a control for assay quality, DNP/Control ratios were calculated, which<br>
gives the activity of mitochondria. Only assays where DNP/Control ratio was larger than 4<br>
were considered acceptable and used in tests.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3. The results show that the compounds of formula I do not<br>
uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. The compounds of formula I thus possess a desirable<br>
safety profile.<br><br>
