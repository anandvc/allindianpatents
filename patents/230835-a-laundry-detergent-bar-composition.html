				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an improved laundry detergent bar composition containing a peroxygen bleach having acceptable physical properties.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are not common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency phosphate builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars- which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel; which have low smear; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Methods for making laundry detergent bars are also well known in the art. Prior art disclosing laundry bars and methods for making laundry bars include: U.S. Pat. 3,178,370, Okenfuss, issued April 13, 1965; and Philippine Pat. 13,778, Anderson, issued September 23, 1980.<br>
Laundry bar compositions are commonly used in countries having high humidity, such as in the Philippines, India, and Latin America. Consumers often launder clothes outside and therefore often store the laundry bars outside. Although not intended to be limited by theory, such bars which are stored at high humidity conditions tend to absorb moisture in such high humidity conditions. Especially for peroxygen bleach containing laundry bar compositions, the absorption of moisture from high humidity conditions creates bars having unacceptable physical properties due to "puffing" of the bars, making the bar surface wet, soft and covered with small holes.<br>
It has now been found that low-moisture bleach containing bars comprising high levels of phosphate and polyphosphate builder materials have acceptable bar physical properties. As a result, the "puffing" problem is substantially eliminated. Also, the bars have significantly less moisture absorption, especially at high humidity conditions, which leads to a good rate of drying of the surface of the bar. In addition, such bar compositions of the present invention have improved hardness of the bar, thereby retaining the structural integrity during use and transportation. The bar of the present invention is substantially not gritty, meaning that the bar should not be rough to the touch and that the bar should have substantially little hard particles on the surface. Furthermore, such compositions have good bar solubility, and do not easily melt after becoming wet during the washing process. Even further, the bleach in the bars of the present invention are stable.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>

All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
As used herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of.<br>
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention. A, The composition of the present invention comprises from about 0.5% to about 60% anionic surfactant by weight of the total bar composition. Preferably, the bar composition comprises from about 10% to about 50%. more preferably, from about 15% to about 30% anionic surfactant, by weight of the total bar composition.<br>

composition.    The total moisture level of the final bar composition can be<br>
determined by any methods known in the art by one skilled in the area of laundry<br>
bar compositions.    One common method is the Bidwell Sterling Distillation<br>
method.   Another known method is the Karl Fischer Moisture Titration Method.<br>
See AOCS official method Dd2a-59 issue 93 and AOCS official method Dd2b-59<br>
issue 89.<br>

Another optional component of the laundry bar is fatty alcohol having an alkyl chain of 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. A preferred fatty alcohol has an alkyl chain predominantly containing from 16 to 18 carbon atoms, so-called "high-cut fatty alcohol," which can exhibit less base odor of fatty alcohol relative to broad cut fatty alcohols. Typically fatty alcohol, if any, is present in the laundry bar at up to a level of 10%, more preferably from about 0.75% to about 6%, most preferably from about 2% to about 5%. The fatty alcohol is generally added to a laundry bar as free fatty alcohol. However, low levels of fatty alcohol can be introduced into the bars as impurities or as<br>
unreacted starting material. For example, laundry bars based on coconut fatty alkyl sulfate can contain, as unreacted starting material, from 0.1% to 3.5%, more typically from 2% to 3%, by weight of free coconut fatty alcohol on a coconut fatty alkyl sulfate basis.<br>
Another optional component in the laundry bar is a dye transfer inhibiting (DTI) ingredient to prevent diminishing of color fidelity and intensity in fabrics. A preferred DTI ingredient can include polymeric DTI materials capable of binding fugitive dyes to prevent them from depositing on the fabrics, and decolorization DTI materials capable of decolorizing the fugitives dye by oxidation. An example of a decolorization DTI is hydrogen peroxide or a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as percarbonate or perborate. Non-limiting examples of polymeric DTI materials include polyvinylpyrridine N-oxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), PVP-polyvinylimidazole copolymer, and mixtures thereof. Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as "PVPI") are also preferred for use herein.

Sodium   sulfate  is  a  well-known  filler  that   is   compatible   with   the compositions of this invention.  It can be a by-product of the surfactant sulfation<br>
and sulfonation processes, or it can be added separately. Calcium carbonate (also known as Calcarb) is also a well known and often used filler component of laundry bars. Talc is another optional filler material. Filler materials are typically used, if included, at levels up to 40%, preferably from about 5% to about 25%.<br>
The fabric softening clay is preferably a smectite-type clay that is compatible with the compositions of this invention. The smectite-type clays can be described as expandable, three-layer clays; i.e., alumino-silicates and magnesium silicates, having an ion exchange capacity of at least about 50 meq/100 g. of clay. Preferably the clay particles are of a size that they can not be perceived tactilely, so as not to have a gritty feel on the treated fabric of the clothes. The fabric softening clay can be added to the bar to provide about 1 % to about 50% by weight of the bar, more preferably from about 2% to about 20%, and most preferably about 3% to 14%.<br>
While any of the smectite-type clays described herein are useful in the present invention, certain clays are preferred. For example, Gelwhite GP is an extremely white form of smectite-type clay and is therefore preferred when formulating white granular detergent compositions. Volclay BC, which is a smectite-type clay mineral containing at least 3% iron (expressed as Fe2O3) in the crystal lattice, and which has a very high ion exchange capacity, is one of the most efficient and effective clays for use in the instant compositions from the standpoint of product performance. On the other hand, certain smectite-type clays are sufficiently contaminated by other silicate minerals that their ion exchange capacities fall below the requisite range; such clays are of no use in the instant compositions.<br>
A Clay flocculating agent is another optional ingredient. Typically such materials have a high molecular weight, greater than about 100,000. Examples of such materials can include long chain polymers and copolymers derived from monomers such as ethylene oxide, acrylamide, acrylic acid, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, vinyl alcohol, vinyl pyrrolidone, and ethylene imine. Gums, like guar gums, are suitable as well. The preferred clay flocculating agent is a poly(ethylene oxide) polymer. The amount of clay flocculating agent, if any, is about 0.2-2%, preferably about 0.5-1%.<br>

Dyes, pigments, germicides, and perfumes can also be added to the bar composition.  If included, they are typically at levels up to about 0.5%.<br>
Another optional component of the subject invention composition is a photobleach material, particularly phthalocyanine photobleaches which are described in U.S. Patent 4,033,718 issued July 5, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. Preferred photobleaches are metal phthalocyanine compounds, the metal preferably having a valance of +2 or +3; zinc and aluminum are preferred metals. Such photobleaches are available, for example, under the tradename TINOLUS or as zinc phthalocyanine sulfonate. The photobleach components, if included, are typically in the subject compositions at levels up to about 0.02%, preferably from about 0.001% to about 0.015%, more preferably from about 0.002% to about 0.01%.<br>
-  Titanium dioxide is another optional component.   It can be a preferred ingredient for aesthetics of the bar composition, e.g. whiteness.<br>
Another useful optional  component of the subject compositions  are detergent enzymes.     Particularly preferred  are  lipase,  protease,   cellulase, amylase, and mixtures thereof. Enzymes, if included, are typically at levels up to about 5%, preferably about 0.05-3%. F.       Bar Physical Properties<br>
Although not intended to be limited by theory, when bars are stored in a high temperature and/or a high humidity environment, such as for example 30°C at 80% relative humidity, the bars absorb moisture from the environment. Because of the moisture absorption, the surfactant at the surface of the bar begins to dissolve. As oxygen gas (from the peroxygen bleach) releases towards the surface of the bar, the gas encounters a layer of dissolved surfactant, thereby forming micro bubbles or "puffing" on the surface. The bars of the present invention substantially have no "puffing" of the bars. This means that the bar's surface is smooth and does not have small holes in the surface<br><br>
that look like indentations. The bars of the present invention are also sufficiently hard and dry even when stored at high temperature and humidity conditions.<br>
A bar physical property of interest is the bar solubility in water. One method of determining the bar solubility is to submerge a bar having the following dimensions: 75mm x 55mm, in 250 ml of water in a beaker for 2 hours, drying the bar at 60 degrees. C for 2 hours and then weighing the bar. To have acceptable bar solubility, the difference in weight should be about 15-30 grams for a 120-125 gram bar (12-25% of the original weight of the bar), more preferably 5-25 grams (4-21 % of the original weight of the bar). G. Processing<br>
The detergent laundry bars of the present invention can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some or all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a typical process the raw materials are mixed in the blender. Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid is reacted with alkaline inorganic salts to complete neutralization, the amount of alkaline inorganic salt being at least sufficient to completely neutralize the acid. At least 5% of the phosphate builder must be present during the neutralization reaction. Preferably at least 10% can be present. Then other optional surfactants followed by any additional optional components such as chelating agents are added. The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air/gas is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar is preferably cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage. It is preferred that the packed cases of bars be stored at a temperature of 20 - 30°C immediately after packing. Without intending to be limited by theory, this step allows the bars to reach a stable state, physically as well as chemically. After this stabilizing stage, storing the bars at a high temperature and humidity condition should not affect the bar's physical properties and aesthetics.<br>
A preferred laundry bar composition is made by the following method: The raw materials are first mixed in a blender. STPP, sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized CFAS (if a mixture of CFAS/LAS is used as surfactant system) are mixed for about 1-2 minutes This is followed by the addition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid (if present in the formulation). The acids are then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (The amount of sodium carbonate should be at least an amount sufficient to neutralize the acids.) Then, a chelating agent, if present is added, followed by other optional surfactants (if present), and any other additional optional components. The total mixing time can take up to about one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about five to twenty minutes. As one of the last ingredients, peroxygen bleach and optionally, enzymes can be added to the mixture and then mixed, preferably, for an additional 2 minutes. It is preferred that when peroxygen bleach is added as one of the last ingredients, the temperature of the blender mixture is about 45 to 65°C. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar is cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage as described above.<br>
