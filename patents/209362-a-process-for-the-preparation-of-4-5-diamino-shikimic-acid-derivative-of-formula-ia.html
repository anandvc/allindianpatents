				<td>The present invention relates to a multi step process for the preparation of 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives, especially for the preparation of (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid ethylester and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts starting from isophthalic acid derivatives," individual process steps thereof, as well as new specific intermediates.<br>
4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives, especially the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid ethylester and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts are potent inhibitors of viral neuraminidase ( J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem., 1998, 63, 4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
A multi step synthesis of (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid ethylester from (-)-quinic acid or (-)-shikimic acid is described in (J.C.Rohloff et al, loc.cit.).<br>
Both (-)-quinic acid and (-)-shikimic acid are starting compounds which are rather expensive and hardly accessible in technical quantities. A multi step synthesis capable to run on a technical scale should therefore preferably be based on starting compounds which are more attractive in price and available in technical quantities.<br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide such a new access to the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives mentioned above in good yields and excellent quality.<br><br>
It was found that with the synthesis according to claim 1 this object could surprisingly be achieved.<br>
/The present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof<br>
wherein R1 is an optionally substituted alkyl group,<br>
R2 is an alkyl group and<br>
R3 and R4, independent of each other are H or a substituent of an amino group, with<br>
the proviso that both R3 and R4 are not H<br>
and which is characterized in that in step a)<br>
an isophtalic acid derivative of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as above and R5 is H or lower alkyl is hydrogenated to form an all-cis-cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula<br><br>
wherein R", R and R are as above,<br>
in step b)<br>
the cyclohexane dicarboxylate of formula (III) is, if R5=H, selectively hydrolyzed to form the (S)- or (R)-cyclohexane monoacid of formulas IVa or IVb or, if R5=lower alkyl, either dealkylated first and then selectively hydrolyzed or selectively hydrolyzed first and then dealkylated to form the (S)- or (R)-cyclohexane mono acid of the formulas<br><br><br>
wherein R and R are as above, in step c)<br>
the cyclohexane monoacid of the formula (IVa) is further converted to an oxazohdinone of the formula<br><br>
wherein R and R are as above,<br>
in step d)<br>
the oxazohdinone of formula (V) is transformed into a cyclohexenol of the formula<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as above and R6 is an amino protecting group<br><br>
in step e)<br>
the cyclohexenol of formula (VI) is further converted into an azide of formula<br><br>
wherein R", R and R^ are as above,<br>
in step f)<br>
the azide of formula (VII) is reduced and acylated to form the acylated amine of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R1 R2 R3 R4 and R5 are as above, and in step g)<br>
the acylated amine of the formula (VIII) is finally transferred into the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) by removing the amino protecting group R and if necessary by forming the respective pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The term alkyl in R" has the meaning of a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 20 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 12 C-atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers, heptyl and its isomers, octyl and its isomers, nonyl and its isomers, decyl and its isomers, undecyl and its isomers and dodecyl and its isomers.<br>
This alkyl group can be substituted with one or more substituents as defined in e.g. WO 98/07685. Suitable substituents are alkyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms (as defined above), alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms, cycloalkyl with 3 to 6 C-atoms, hydroxy, alkoxy with 1 to 6 C-atoms, alkoxycarbonyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms, F, CI, Br, and J. Preferred meaning for R"is 1-ethylpropyl.<br>
R is a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 12 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 6 C-atoms as exemplified above.<br>
Preferred meaning for R is ethyl.<br>
R5 is a lower n-alkyl group of 1 to 3 C-atoms, preferably methyl.<br>
R3 and R4 is a substituent of an amino group conventionally used and known in the art and described e.g. in WO 98/07685.<br>
R3 and R4 preferably stand for alkanoyl groups, more preferably lower alkanoyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms such as hexanoyl, pentanoyl, butanoyl (butyryl), propanoyl (propionyl), ethanoyl (acetyl) and methanoyl (formyl). Preferred alkanoyl group and therefore preferred meaning for R3 is acetyl and for R4" is H.<br><br>
R^ is a common amino protecting group conventionally used and known in the art and described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Theodora W. Greene et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1991, 315-385.<br>
R^ suitably is benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), tert.-butyloxycarbonyl (BOG), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC), preferably tert.-butoxycarbonyl (BOG).<br>
Preferred 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) is the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxyIic acid ethylester and the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxyric acid ethyl ester phosphate (1:1).<br>
Provided that the process from step c) onwards is run with the cyclohexane monoacid of the formula (IVb) the process of the present invention allows to produce the (+)-enantiomer of the 4,5-dimino shikimic acid derivative having the formula<br><br>
wherein R^ R^ R^ and R^ are as above and all the (+)-enantiomers of the corresponding intermediates.<br>
Step a)<br>
Step a) comprises the hydrogenation of an isophtalic acid derivative of the formula (II) to an all-cis- cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III).<br><br>
Hydrogenation takes place with hydrogen in the presence of a common hydrogenation catalyst which may be applied on an inert support. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are rhodium or ruthenium applied in an amount of 1 to 10% on an inert support, such as on aluminium oxide or charcoal.<br>
The hydrogenation can be effected in an inert solvent like ethylacetate, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or tert.-butyl methyl ether at temperatures between 20°C and 150°C and at hydrogen pressures between 1 bar and 200 bar .<br>
The resulting cydohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III) shows an all-cis meso form and therefore is optically inactive.<br>
Step b)<br>
Step b) comprises a selective enzymatic hydrolysis and, if necessary, a dealkylation of the cydohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III) to either the (S)- or (R)-cydohexane mono acid of the formulas (IVa) or (IVb).<br>
Starting from the cydohexane dicarboxylate of formula (III) with R =H selective enzymatic hydrolysis can directly take place, however, starting from the cydohexane dicarboxylate of formula (III) with R^=lower alkyl dealkylation can either take place before or after the selective hydrolysis.<br>
The dealkylation, can take place with an alkali iodide in the presence of a trialkylhalogen silane. Dealkylation preferably is a demethylation and preferably sodium iodide together with trimethylchlorosilane is used.<br>
This dealkylation as a rule is performed in an inert solvent, such as in acetonitril at temperatures between 20°C and 80 °C.<br><br>
Selective hydrolysis comprises an enzymatic hydrolysis of the cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III), whereby the choice of the enzyme determines whether the (S)-monoacid of the formula<br><br>
or the (R)-monoacid isomer of the formula<br><br>
can be obtained.<br>
In order to achieve the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid of formula (la) with the desired stereo configuration the subsequent reaction steps have to be performed with the (S)-monoacid of formula (IVa).<br>
Starting with the all-cis-cyclohexane dicarboxylate of formula III with R = H suitable enzymes to gain the (S)-isomer of formula (IVa) are esterases of the EC class 3.1.1.1, preferably mammalian esterases (e.g. from pig, bovine or horse). The most preferred<br><br>
enzyme is pig liver esterase (which is subsequently termed PLE). Commercial preparations ofPLE can be purchased e.g. from Roche Diagnostics, Fluka, Sigma, Amano or Altus. Also less purified PLE preparations (e.g. "PLE technical grade" from Roche Diagnostics) or only poorly purified preparations (e.g. such as "pig liver acetone powder" from Fluka) can be used as well as PLE preparations with enriched or separated isozyme fractions (like e.g. Chirazyme E-1 or Chirazyme E-2 from Roche Diagnostics).<br>
As a common alternative the enzymes may be used in immobilized form.<br>
The substrate is applied as a suspension in an aqueous solution in a 5 - 15% concentration (w/w), preferably around 10%. A suitable reaction temperature is room temperature to 35°C, a suitable reaction pH between 6.5 and 8.5.<br>
As to the aqueous phase, common buffer solutions known to be used for biochemical conversions are used like e.g. phosphate or Tris-buffer in a concentration of 5 - 50 mM. Such a buffer solution can additionally contain a salt like e.g. NaCl or KCl in a concentration of 50 to 300 mM. A preferred buffering system could e.g. contain 0.1 M KCl and 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride pH 8.0.<br>
After addition of the enzyme the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained under stirring at the selected value by the controlled addition of a base such as NaOH or KOH, whereby the formed monoacid goes into solution and the reaction mixture becomes rather clear.<br>
After termination of the reaction, the product is worked up conventionally by acidification of the reaction mixture and extraction with a common organic solvent.<br>
Starting with the all-cis cyclohexane dicarboxylate of formula 111 with R = H or lower alkyl, preferably methyl, suitable enzymes to gain the (R)-isomer of formula (IVb) are lipases of the EC class 3.1.1.3. Suitable representatives of this class are the lipases from Aspergillus oryzae (commercially available at Fluka), Thermomyces lanuginosa (formerly termed Humicola lanuginosa; e.g. from Novo Nordisk) and from Mucor miehei (e.g. from Novo Nordisk). Again, also less purified crude enzyme preparations maybe used.<br>
Again, as a common alternative, the enzymes may be used in immobilized form.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an aqueous or an aqueous-organic biphasic system. Preferred is a biphasic system with a water-immiscible apolar solvent as co-solvent. Suitable co-solvents are alkanes or cycloalkanes, preferred is cyclohexane.<br><br>
The substrate is applied (as a suspension) in the mono- or biphasic system in 5 - 10 % overall concentration (w/w). A suitable reaction temperature is room temperature to 35°C, a suitable reaction pH between 6.5 and 8.5.<br>
As to the aqueous phase, common buffer solutions known to be used for biochemical conversions are used like e.g. phosphate, borate or Tris-buffer in a concentration of 5 - 50 mM. Such a buffer solution can additionally contain a salt like e.g. NaCl, KCl or a polyhydric alcohol such as a sugar (e.g. glucose) in a concentration of 50 to 300 mM. A preferred buffering system could e.g. contain 0.1 M glucose and 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0.<br>
The ratio organic solvent / aqueous phase is in the range of 1:10 to 1:1.<br>
After addition of the enzyme the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained under stirring at the selected value by the controlled addition of a base such as NaOH or KOH.<br>
After termination of the reaction, the product is worked up conventionally by acidification of the reaction mixture and extraction with a common organic solvent.<br>
Step c)<br>
Step c) comprises the conversion of the cyclohexane mono acid of the formula (IVa) into the oxazolidinone of formula (V).<br>
This conversion can take place applying the known principles of a Curtius or of a Hoffmann degradation. Where in the Hofmann degradation the oxazolidinone is formed by transformation of the cyclohexane monoacid into the respective cyclohexane monoamide and by subsequent ring formation e.g. with a hyprochlorite, the Curtius degradation involves the formation of the cyclohexane azide intermediate.<br>
As a suitable variation of the Curtius degradation a Yamada-Curtius degradation using dialkylphosphorylazides or diarylphosphoryl azides, preferably diarylphosphoryl azides, most preferably diphenyl phosphoryl azide (DPPA) can be applied.<br><br>
The Yamada-Curtius degradation usually takes place in the presence of a tertiary amine preferably triethylamine and in an inert solvent such as e.g. methylene chloride or ethylacetate.<br>
Step d)<br>
Step d) covers the transformation of the oxazolidinone of formula (V) into a cyclohexenol<br>
of formula (VI).	"<br>
This transformation comprises the introduction of an amino protecting group R^ and a subsequent base induced transformation to the cyclohexenol of formula (VI).<br>
Suitable substituents of the amino group R are as stated above, however , the BOC group is the preferred group.<br>
Introduction of the amino protecting group is known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable base for the subsequent base induced transformation is an alkalihydride, an alkalialcoholate, diazabicyclo undecen (DBU) or a tetraalkyl guanidine. Preferred base is sodium hydride applied in amounts of 0.5 to 25 mol%.<br>
Usually the reaction takes place in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride , toluene, tetrahydrofurane, ethylacetate at reflux temperature of the respective solvent.<br>
The cyclohexenol of formula (VI) can be isolated from the reaction mixture by methods known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Step e)<br><br>
Step e) comprises the formation of an azide of formula (VII).<br>
This step involves in a first sequence the transformation of the hydroxy group into a suitable leaving group and in a second sequence the azide formation, thereby leading to an inversion of configuration at the reaction centre.<br>
The transformation of the OH group into a leaving group can be performed by sulfonylation i.e. converting the OH group into a sulfonic acid ester.<br>
Agents commonly used for producing such sulfonic esters are e.g. the halogenides orfthe anhydrides of the following sulfonic acids: methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid a p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.<br>
Preferred agent is a halogenide or anhydride of trifluoro methane sulfonic acid such as trifluoro methane sulfonic anhydride.<br>
The sulfonylating agent is expediently added in an amount of 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the cyclohexenol of formula VI in presence of about two equivalents of a suitable base.<br>
The reaction usually takes place in an inert solvent such as in methylene chloride and at reaction temperatures between -20°C and room temperature.<br>
The sulfonic acid ester formed can be isolated and purified, e.g. by crystallization or directly be introduced into the following reaction sequence.<br>
Azide formation is effected by treating the sulfonic acid ester intermediate previously obtained with a suitable azide whereby inversion of the configuration takes place. Azides commonly used are alkaliazides like sodium azide in amounts of 1 to 2 equivalents. The reaction takes place in a solvent such as in dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol or acetone at temperatures betwen -10°C and 50°C.<br>
Stepf)<br><br>
Step f) covers the reduction of the azide and the subsequent acylation of the resuhing amine to form the respective acylated amine of the formula (VIII).<br>
Reduction takes place either by a) a classical metal catalysed hydrogenation with hydrogen or b) by reduction of the azide with a phosphine.<br>
According to method a) common hydrogenation catalysts such as e.g. Pd, Pt, Raney-Ni or Raney-Co catalysts which may be applied on an inert support can be used.<br>
The hydrogenation can take place in a suitable organic solvent e.g. in ethylacetate at temperatures between 20°C and 60°C at at hydrogen pressures between 1 and 50 bar.<br>
Phosphines which according to method b) can suitably be used are trioctyl phosphine, triisobutyl phosphine and tri-n-butyl phosphine. Most preferred phosphine is the tri-n-butyl phosphine.<br>
Typically the reduction is performed in a polar solvent such as in ethylacetate or in tetrahydrofurane in presence of 1 to 20 equivalents of water.<br>
The reaction temperature, depending on the phosphine used, as a rule is chosen in the range of-20°C and 50°C.<br>
The amine formed can be isolated but is preferably directly acylated in the following reaction sequence.<br>
Acylation can be effected using acylating agents in the presence of a base and at conditions known to the skilled in the art. Suitable acylating agents as a rule are aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid halides or anhydrides. Preferred acylating agents are the common acetylating agents such as acetyl chloride or acetanhydride.<br>
Step g)<br>
Step g) comprises the removal of the amino protecting group R* and if necessary the formation of the respective pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I).<br><br>
The amino protecting group R* can be removed following methods well known to the skilled in the art. The preferred BOC group can e.g. easily be splitted off with HBr in acetic acid at room temperature or with HCl in ethylacetate.<br>
The free amine can then be liberated with e.g. an aqueous base and then further be transformed into the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt following the methods described in J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem. 63, 1998, 4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
The salt formation is effected at room temperature in accordance with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is the 1:1 salt with phosphoric acid which can be formed preferably in ethanolic solution at a temperature of-20°C to 50°C.<br>
The invention further comprises a process for the the preparation of an isophtalic acid derivative of the formula<br><br>
wherein R", R^ and R^ are as above<br><br>
which is characterized in that a dialkoxyphenol of the formula<br><br>
wherein R^ is as above<br>
is<br>
in step aa)<br>
converted into a trialkoxybenzene of the formula<br><br>
wherein R and R are as above,<br>
and in step ab)<br>
further halogenated to a dihalotrialkoxy benzene of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R" and R^ are as above and X stands for a halogen atom and finally<br>
in step ac)<br>
carbonylated to form the product of the formula II.<br>
step aa)<br>
Etherification of the dialkyloxyphenol of formula X can be performed with the methane sulfonic acid ester of the respective alcohol R"OH. Reaction as a rule takes place in the presence of a strong base such as an alkah alcoholate in an inert solvent.<br>
Alternatively etherification can happen under Mitsunobu conditions (O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1) i.e. by treatment of the dialkoxyphenol of formula X with the respective alcohol R"OH in the presence of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and triphenyl phosphine in a suitable inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran.<br>
step ab)<br>
The halogenation in this step preferably is a dibromination.<br>
A suitable bromination agent for the trialkoxybenzene of formula XI is e.g. N-bromo succinimide (NBS).<br>
Dibromination usually takes place with 2 equivalents NBS in a polar solvent such as in N,N-dimethylformamide at temperatures between -10°C and 50°C.<br><br>
step ac)<br>
Carbonylation of the dihalotrialkoxybenzene of formula XII can be performed with carbon monoxide in the presence of suitable catalyst in an alcoholic solvent like ethanol.<br>
Suitable catalysts are metal complexes formed by a metal compound of the group VIII element of the periodoc table and a phosphine compound e.g. of palladium acetate and 1,3-bis (diphenyl phosphino) propane (dppp) or triphenylphosphine.<br>
Usually the reaction is performed at temperatures of 80°C to 150°C and at CO-pressures up to 20 bar.<br>
The invention further comprises a process for the preparation of an all-cis-cyclohexane dicarboxylate derivative of the formula<br><br>
wherein R", R^ and R^ are as above<br>
which is characterized in that an isophtalic acid derivative of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R\ R^ and R^ are as above<br>
is hydrogenated.<br>
This step is identical to step a) of the multistep synthesis described herein above. The repsective description of step a) is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The invention further comprises a selective hydrolysis and, if necessary, a dealkylation of an all-cis-cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula<br><br>
wherein R\ R^ and R^ are as above,<br>
to form the (S)- or (R)-cyclohexane monoacid of the formulas.<br><br>
wherein R^ and R^ are as above.<br>
This step is equivalent to step b) of the multistep synthesis described herein above. The respective description of step b) is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The following key intermediates are new and not known to the state of the art, they accordingly are an essential element of the present invention.<br><br>

A multi step synthesis of (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid ethylester from (-)-quinic acid or (-)-shikimic acid is described in (J.C.Rohloff et al, loc.cit.).<br>
Both (-)-quinic acid and (-)-shikimic acid are starting compounds which are rather expensive and hardly accessible in technical quantities. A multi step synthesis capable to run on a technical scale should therefore preferably be based on starting compounds which are more attractive in price and available in technical quantities.<br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide such a new access to the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives mentioned above in good yields and excellent quality.<br><br>
It was found that with the synthesis according to claim 1 this object could surprisingly be achieved.<br>

the acylated amine of the formula (VIII) is finally transferred into the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) by removing the amino protecting group R and if necessary by forming the respective pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The term alkyl in R" has the meaning of a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 20 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 12 C-atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers, heptyl and its isomers, octyl and its isomers, nonyl and its isomers, decyl and its isomers, undecyl and its isomers and dodecyl and its isomers.<br>
This alkyl group can be substituted with one or more substituents as defined in e.g. WO 98/07685. Suitable substituents are alkyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms (as defined above), alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms, cycloalkyl with 3 to 6 C-atoms, hydroxy, alkoxy with 1 to 6 C-atoms, alkoxycarbonyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms, F, CI, Br, and J. Preferred meaning for R"is 1-ethylpropyl.<br>
R is a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 12 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 6 C-atoms as exemplified above.<br>
Preferred meaning for R is ethyl.<br>

R3 and R4 is a substituent of an amino group conventionally used and known in the art and described e.g. in WO 98/07685.<br>
R3 and R4 preferably stand for alkanoyl groups, more preferably lower alkanoyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms such as hexanoyl, pentanoyl, butanoyl (butyryl), propanoyl (propionyl), ethanoyl (acetyl) and methanoyl (formyl). Preferred alkanoyl group and therefore preferred meaning for R3 is acetyl and for R4" is H.<br><br>
R^ is a common amino protecting group conventionally used and known in the art and described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Theodora W. Greene et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1991, 315-385.<br>
R^ suitably is benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), tert.-butyloxycarbonyl (BOG), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC), preferably tert.-butoxycarbonyl (BOG).<br>
Preferred 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) is the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxyIic acid ethylester and the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxyric acid ethyl ester phosphate (1:1).<br>
Provided that the process from step c) onwards is run with the cyclohexane monoacid of the formula (IVb) the process of the present invention allows to produce the (+)-enantiomer of the 4,5-dimino shikimic acid derivative having the formula<br><br>
wherein R^ R^ R^ and R^ are as above and all the (+)-enantiomers of the corresponding intermediates.<br>
Step a)<br>
Step a) comprises the hydrogenation of an isophtalic acid derivative of the formula (II) to an all-cis- cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III).<br><br>
Hydrogenation takes place with hydrogen in the presence of a common hydrogenation catalyst which may be applied on an inert support. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are rhodium or ruthenium applied in an amount of 1 to 10% on an inert support, such as on aluminium oxide or charcoal.<br>
The hydrogenation can be effected in an inert solvent like ethylacetate, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or tert.-butyl methyl ether at temperatures between 20°C and 150°C and at hydrogen pressures between 1 bar and 200 bar .<br>
The resulting cydohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III) shows an all-cis meso form and therefore is optically inactive.<br>
Step b)<br>
Step b) comprises a selective enzymatic hydrolysis and, if necessary, a dealkylation of the cydohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III) to either the (S)- or (R)-cydohexane mono acid of the formulas (IVa) or (IVb).<br>
Starting from the cydohexane dicarboxylate of formula (III) with R =H selective enzymatic hydrolysis can directly take place, however, starting from the cydohexane dicarboxylate of formula (III) with R^=lower alkyl dealkylation can either take place before or after the selective hydrolysis.<br>
The dealkylation, can take place with an alkali iodide in the presence of a trialkylhalogen silane. Dealkylation preferably is a demethylation and preferably sodium iodide together with trimethylchlorosilane is used.<br>
This dealkylation as a rule is performed in an inert solvent, such as in acetonitril at temperatures between 20°C and 80 °C.<br><br>
Selective hydrolysis comprises an enzymatic hydrolysis of the cyclohexane dicarboxylate of the formula (III), whereby the choice of the enzyme determines whether the (S)-monoacid of the formula<br><br>
or the (R)-monoacid isomer of the formula<br><br>
can be obtained.<br>
In order to achieve the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid of formula (la) with the desired stereo configuration the subsequent reaction steps have to be performed with the (S)-monoacid of formula (IVa).<br>
Starting with the all-cis-cyclohexane dicarboxylate of formula III with R = H suitable enzymes to gain the (S)-isomer of formula (IVa) are esterases of the EC class 3.1.1.1, preferably mammalian esterases (e.g. from pig, bovine or horse). The most preferred<br><br>
enzyme is pig liver esterase (which is subsequently termed PLE). Commercial preparations ofPLE can be purchased e.g. from Roche Diagnostics, Fluka, Sigma, Amano or Altus. Also less purified PLE preparations (e.g. "PLE technical grade" from Roche Diagnostics) or only poorly purified preparations (e.g. such as "pig liver acetone powder" from Fluka) can be used as well as PLE preparations with enriched or separated isozyme fractions (like e.g. Chirazyme E-1 or Chirazyme E-2 from Roche Diagnostics).<br>
As a common alternative the enzymes may be used in immobilized form.<br>
The substrate is applied as a suspension in an aqueous solution in a 5 - 15% concentration (w/w), preferably around 10%. A suitable reaction temperature is room temperature to 35°C, a suitable reaction pH between 6.5 and 8.5.<br>
As to the aqueous phase, common buffer solutions known to be used for biochemical conversions are used like e.g. phosphate or Tris-buffer in a concentration of 5 - 50 mM. Such a buffer solution can additionally contain a salt like e.g. NaCl or KCl in a concentration of 50 to 300 mM. A preferred buffering system could e.g. contain 0.1 M KCl and 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride pH 8.0.<br>
After addition of the enzyme the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained under stirring at the selected value by the controlled addition of a base such as NaOH or KOH, whereby the formed monoacid goes into solution and the reaction mixture becomes rather clear.<br>
After termination of the reaction, the product is worked up conventionally by acidification of the reaction mixture and extraction with a common organic solvent.<br>
Starting with the all-cis cyclohexane dicarboxylate of formula 111 with R = H or lower alkyl, preferably methyl, suitable enzymes to gain the (R)-isomer of formula (IVb) are lipases of the EC class 3.1.1.3. Suitable representatives of this class are the lipases from Aspergillus oryzae (commercially available at Fluka), Thermomyces lanuginosa (formerly termed Humicola lanuginosa; e.g. from Novo Nordisk) and from Mucor miehei (e.g. from Novo Nordisk). Again, also less purified crude enzyme preparations maybe used.<br>
Again, as a common alternative, the enzymes may be used in immobilized form.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an aqueous or an aqueous-organic biphasic system. Preferred is a biphasic system with a water-immiscible apolar solvent as co-solvent. Suitable co-solvents are alkanes or cycloalkanes, preferred is cyclohexane.<br><br>
The substrate is applied (as a suspension) in the mono- or biphasic system in 5 - 10 % overall concentration (w/w). A suitable reaction temperature is room temperature to 35°C, a suitable reaction pH between 6.5 and 8.5.<br>
As to the aqueous phase, common buffer solutions known to be used for biochemical conversions are used like e.g. phosphate, borate or Tris-buffer in a concentration of 5 - 50 mM. Such a buffer solution can additionally contain a salt like e.g. NaCl, KCl or a polyhydric alcohol such as a sugar (e.g. glucose) in a concentration of 50 to 300 mM. A preferred buffering system could e.g. contain 0.1 M glucose and 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0.<br>
The ratio organic solvent / aqueous phase is in the range of 1:10 to 1:1.<br>
After addition of the enzyme the pH of the reaction mixture is maintained under stirring at the selected value by the controlled addition of a base such as NaOH or KOH.<br>
After termination of the reaction, the product is worked up conventionally by acidification of the reaction mixture and extraction with a common organic solvent.<br>
Step c)<br>
Step c) comprises the conversion of the cyclohexane mono acid of the formula (IVa) into the oxazolidinone of formula (V).<br>
This conversion can take place applying the known principles of a Curtius or of a Hoffmann degradation. Where in the Hofmann degradation the oxazolidinone is formed by transformation of the cyclohexane monoacid into the respective cyclohexane monoamide and by subsequent ring formation e.g. with a hyprochlorite, the Curtius degradation involves the formation of the cyclohexane azide intermediate.<br>
As a suitable variation of the Curtius degradation a Yamada-Curtius degradation using dialkylphosphorylazides or diarylphosphoryl azides, preferably diarylphosphoryl azides, most preferably diphenyl phosphoryl azide (DPPA) can be applied.<br><br>
The Yamada-Curtius degradation usually takes place in the presence of a tertiary amine preferably triethylamine and in an inert solvent such as e.g. methylene chloride or ethylacetate.<br>
Step d)<br>
Step d) covers the transformation of the oxazolidinone of formula (V) into a cyclohexenol<br>
of formula (VI).	"<br>
This transformation comprises the introduction of an amino protecting group R^ and a subsequent base induced transformation to the cyclohexenol of formula (VI).<br>
Suitable substituents of the amino group R are as stated above, however , the BOC group is the preferred group.<br>
Introduction of the amino protecting group is known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable base for the subsequent base induced transformation is an alkalihydride, an alkalialcoholate, diazabicyclo undecen (DBU) or a tetraalkyl guanidine. Preferred base is sodium hydride applied in amounts of 0.5 to 25 mol%.<br>
Usually the reaction takes place in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride , toluene, tetrahydrofurane, ethylacetate at reflux temperature of the respective solvent.<br>
The cyclohexenol of formula (VI) can be isolated from the reaction mixture by methods known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Step e)<br><br>
Step e) comprises the formation of an azide of formula (VII).<br>
This step involves in a first sequence the transformation of the hydroxy group into a suitable leaving group and in a second sequence the azide formation, thereby leading to an inversion of configuration at the reaction centre.<br>
The transformation of the OH group into a leaving group can be performed by sulfonylation i.e. converting the OH group into a sulfonic acid ester.<br>
Agents commonly used for producing such sulfonic esters are e.g. the halogenides orfthe anhydrides of the following sulfonic acids: methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid a p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.<br>
Preferred agent is a halogenide or anhydride of trifluoro methane sulfonic acid such as trifluoro methane sulfonic anhydride.<br>
The sulfonylating agent is expediently added in an amount of 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the cyclohexenol of formula VI in presence of about two equivalents of a suitable base.<br>
The reaction usually takes place in an inert solvent such as in methylene chloride and at reaction temperatures between -20°C and room temperature.<br>
The sulfonic acid ester formed can be isolated and purified, e.g. by crystallization or directly be introduced into the following reaction sequence.<br>
Azide formation is effected by treating the sulfonic acid ester intermediate previously obtained with a suitable azide whereby inversion of the configuration takes place. Azides commonly used are alkaliazides like sodium azide in amounts of 1 to 2 equivalents. The reaction takes place in a solvent such as in dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol or acetone at temperatures betwen -10°C and 50°C.<br>
Stepf)<br><br>
Step f) covers the reduction of the azide and the subsequent acylation of the resuhing amine to form the respective acylated amine of the formula (VIII).<br>
Reduction takes place either by a) a classical metal catalysed hydrogenation with hydrogen or b) by reduction of the azide with a phosphine.<br>
According to method a) common hydrogenation catalysts such as e.g. Pd, Pt, Raney-Ni or Raney-Co catalysts which may be applied on an inert support can be used.<br>
The hydrogenation can take place in a suitable organic solvent e.g. in ethylacetate at temperatures between 20°C and 60°C at at hydrogen pressures between 1 and 50 bar.<br>
Phosphines which according to method b) can suitably be used are trioctyl phosphine, triisobutyl phosphine and tri-n-butyl phosphine. Most preferred phosphine is the tri-n-butyl phosphine.<br>
Typically the reduction is performed in a polar solvent such as in ethylacetate or in tetrahydrofurane in presence of 1 to 20 equivalents of water.<br>
The reaction temperature, depending on the phosphine used, as a rule is chosen in the range of-20°C and 50°C.<br>
The amine formed can be isolated but is preferably directly acylated in the following reaction sequence.<br>
Acylation can be effected using acylating agents in the presence of a base and at conditions known to the skilled in the art. Suitable acylating agents as a rule are aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid halides or anhydrides. Preferred acylating agents are the common acetylating agents such as acetyl chloride or acetanhydride.<br>
Step g)<br>
Step g) comprises the removal of the amino protecting group R* and if necessary the formation of the respective pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I).<br><br>
The amino protecting group R* can be removed following methods well known to the skilled in the art. The preferred BOC group can e.g. easily be splitted off with HBr in acetic acid at room temperature or with HCl in ethylacetate.<br>
The free amine can then be liberated with e.g. an aqueous base and then further be transformed into the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt following the methods described in J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem. 63, 1998, 4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
The salt formation is effected at room temperature in accordance with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is the 1:1 salt with phosphoric acid which can be formed preferably in ethanolic solution at a temperature of-20°C to 50°C.<br>

Etherification of the dialkyloxyphenol of formula X can be performed with the methane sulfonic acid ester of the respective alcohol R"OH. Reaction as a rule takes place in the presence of a strong base such as an alkah alcoholate in an inert solvent.<br>
Alternatively etherification can happen under Mitsunobu conditions (O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1) i.e. by treatment of the dialkoxyphenol of formula X with the respective alcohol R"OH in the presence of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and triphenyl phosphine in a suitable inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran.<br>
step ab)<br>
The halogenation in this step preferably is a dibromination.<br>
A suitable bromination agent for the trialkoxybenzene of formula XI is e.g. N-bromo succinimide (NBS).<br>
Dibromination usually takes place with 2 equivalents NBS in a polar solvent such as in N,N-dimethylformamide at temperatures between -10°C and 50°C.<br><br>
step ac)<br>
Carbonylation of the dihalotrialkoxybenzene of formula XII can be performed with carbon monoxide in the presence of suitable catalyst in an alcoholic solvent like ethanol.<br>
Suitable catalysts are metal complexes formed by a metal compound of the group VIII element of the periodoc table and a phosphine compound e.g. of palladium acetate and 1,3-bis (diphenyl phosphino) propane (dppp) or triphenylphosphine.<br>
