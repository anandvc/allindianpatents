FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
I â€˜he present invention relates to a mould assembly. More particularly, a device for casting and reheating of metallic alloys in an electromagnetic stirrer to produce billets with non-dendritic globular microstructure comprising mould assembly consisting of; a casing (1) having a cooling mould (2b) at its lower end, a refractory tube (2a) placed inside the casing (1) and supported onto the cooling mould (2b), an end cap (2d) acting as a base to provide for extraction of the billets, and a cooling arrangement (2c) surrounding the cooling mould (2b) to extract heat from molten metal; and an electromagnetic stirrer circumfercntially surrounding the mould assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
In several applications of casting, dendritic microstructure is not desirable as it results in poor mechanical properties. Enhancing the fluid flow in the mushy zone by stirring (such as electromagnetic stirring) during casting is one of the means to suppress this dendritic growth. The strong fluid flow detaches the dendrites from the solid-liquid interface and carries them into the mould to form slurry. This slurry has a solid phase consisting of fragmented dendrites, instead of the conventional dendritic structure, immersed in liquid. When this slurry solidifies, the microstructure is characterized by non-dendritic primary phase particles, usually in a globular or rosetted form, separated and enclosed by a near-eutectic lower-melting secondary phase. Stirring of the alloy in the liquid state can be done by several methods, such as electromagnetic ally, mechanically or by using ultrasonic vibrations.<br>
The existing methods of producing a billet with non-dendritic microstructure can be classified into two categories, namely 'Thixocasting' and 'Recasting'. In the thixocasting operation, billets having non-dendritic microstructure are first produced through a direct chilled (DC) casting operation along with mechanical or electromagnetic stirring. The non-dendritic billet casting is similar to the conventional DC casting process in many ways. However, unlike in a conventional DC casting process, it is also subjected to a stirring (e.g. electromagnetic stirring (EMS)) in order to shear off the dendrites in the mushy zone. In most existing practices of recasting, liquid alloy<br><br>
with a prescribed superheat is poured into a mould, usually made of metal or refractory material. The metal in the mould is stirred until a specified temperature is reached. The resultant stirred slurry is then transferred into a separate mould/container and instantaneously cooled to form a billet. In either method described above, the billet is further reheated in a heat treatment furnace, following the standard heat treatment practice for that particular alloy. After heat treatment the resultant solid attains the desired final semisolid microstructure, which is the preferred microstructure for further processing to form light weight high performance castings.<br>
In the conventional processes described above, stirring provides the necessary forces to break the dendrites formed during solidification, which is the first step in creating a non-dendritic microstructure. However, the desired final globular microstructure is obtained only after heat treatment.<br>

figure 1 illustrates the side cross section of mould assembly having casing (1), the refractory tube (2a) which maximizes the effect of electromagnetic forces acting on the liquid metal, cooling mould (2b), cooling arrangement (2c), end cap (2d) prevents<br><br>
leakage of liquid metal from the mould, mould cooling water inlet (2e), mould cooling water outlet (2f).<br>
figure 2 illustrates the cross section of the mould showing mechanism of dendritic shear, fhe liquid metal at a desired superheat is poured into a mould which is cooled at the bottom depending on the desired cooling rate, either air or water can be used as the cooling medium in the mould entered through mould cooling inlet (2e) and comes out through mould cooling outlet (2f). The alloy is stirred electromagnetically by employing a linear electromagnetic stirrer (LEMS) by creating convective flow (3). In the process of stirring the dendrites/solid particles formed at the interface are sheared and transported into the bulk melt inside the stirrer to form slurry. Due to the specific cooling design of the mould, heat is extracted from and the solidification front advances from the bottom of the mould to the top of the sfirrer to form solidified metal.<br>
The linear electromagnetic stirrer can simultaneously stir as well as heat the metal (by induction heating, which can be independently controlled. The same stirrer, when energized with high frequency power without any phase shift in currents, is capable of producing heat without altering average stirring forces. We may therefore excite the stirrer coil with low frequency phase displaced currents to produce the stirring forces and high frequency phase aligned currents to produce heating in the billet. Hence, this stirrer offers flexibility in controlling the cooling rate of the alloy.<br>
Stirring will stop once the solid fraction reaches a critical value, usually known as the coherency point. Further cooling of the alloy results in a solidified billet cast inside the stirrer. During solidification, the solid fraction of the slurry is also dynamically monitored by measuring the temperature using a thermocouple placed inside the melt. Even after solidification of the billet is complete as detected by the thermocouple temperature measurement, heating of the billet can be controlled by high-frequency induction heating provided by the same LEMS. Hence, for this heat treatment process, one can tune the input power supply parameters to the stirrer coils to facilitate induction heating suitable for heat treatment.<br><br>
An important feature of the method lies in the fact that the solidified billet can be heat treated without removing it from the mould. Hence, the method described herein is a one-step process to obtain the final micro structure, thus eliminating the need for additional heat treatment.<br>
The technology of the instant invention is further elaborated with the help of following example. However, the example should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example:<br>
The equipment is tested extensively for aluminum-silicon alloys. However, the method is applicable for all metals and its alloys. Although the method is tested using a linear electromagnetic stirrer, the method is applicable to any other form of electromagnetic stirring.<br>
blxtensive laboratory tests using the mould assembly apparatus and procedure have been carried out. The tests have been carried out using A-356 alloy. Some sample results in the form of micrographs are presented in Figure 3(a-c). The case with no stirring yielded dendritic microstructure as shown in fig. 3 (a). The case with a moderate stirring current of 250 A (involving low induction heating) gave rise to reseated structure shown in fig. 3 (b). Figure 3c corresponds to high stirring current of 450 A (resulting in high induction heating as well), yielding globular microstructure<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The disclosed mould assembly for casting billets having non-dendritic globular microstructure comprises of a casing (1) having a cooling mould (2b) at its lower end, a refractory tube (2a) placed inside the casing (1) and supported onto the cooling mould (2b), an end cap (2d) acting as a base to provide for extraction of the billets, and a cooling arrangement (2c) surrounding the cooling mould (2b) to extract heat from molten metal. The mould assembly is placed in core of the electromagnetic stirrer such that electromagnetic forces acts upon liquid metal poured inside the mould finds potential<br><br>
