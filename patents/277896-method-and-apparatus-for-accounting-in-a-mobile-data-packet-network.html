				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present disclosures pertains to accounting reports and procedures on<br>
a data packet network communicating to access terminals over a radio access network, and more particularly to communication systems formed by an access gateway interfacing between a radio access network and an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) function of a core network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Mobile communication devices are proliferating in functions and uses,<br>
with increasing demands upon communication infrastructures to evolve to meet the demand. Mobile communication devices, also referred to as access terminals and user equipment, continue to merge in capabilities with other types of computing devices such as wireless capable laptop and notebook computers. As such, so called third- and fourth-generation mobile communication systems are moving toward essentially a wireless broadband Internet system with voice and other services built on top. Paying for such wireless communication thus needs to address data packet nature of the usage and the distributed and increasingly flatter architecture. Collecting all of the accounting tracking data in a core network can be disadvantaged in obtaining such usage data accurately and without an undue amount of message traffic.<br>
[0004]	As depicted in FIG.   1,  in a conventional converged communication<br>
system 100 having Internet Protocol (IP) services provided by a core network 102. packet data accounting parameters are divided into radio specific parameters collected by a Radio Access Network (RAN) 104 that communicates with end user equipment (access terminals) 106 via an air link 107, and IP network specific parameters collected by a core network function, such as a Serving Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) 108.<br>
 <br>
The Serving PDSN 108 merges radio specific parameters in interface messages called Air link Records, depicted at 110, from the RAN 104 passed through a packet control function (PCF) 112 with IP network specific parameters to form one or more Usage Data Records (UDR) in accordance with prepaid rules 114 or charging rules 116. Prepaid packet data service allows a user to purchase packet data service in advance based on volume or duration.<br>
[0005]	After merging the air link records  110, the Serving PDSN  10S uses<br>
accounting messages (e.g., RADIUS accounting protocol) to send UDR information,<br>
depicted at 118. to a Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) sewer 120.<br>
which can entail a visited AAA server communicating with a home AAA server,<br>
perhaps with a proxy AAA server interfacing there between, for example, The sewing<br>
PDSN 108 maintains accumulated UDR information until the packet data service is<br>
terminated or until the server PDSN 108 receives positive acknowledgment from the<br>
AAA server 120 that the AAA server 120 has correctly received the UDR message. For<br>
instances in which the AAA server 120 is a visited rather than a home AAA server, the<br>
visited AAA server 120 maintains the UDR until the record is delivered to a home AAA<br>
server (not shown), or removed by an operator billing system (not shown).<br>
[0006]	The  Packet  Data  Serving  Node,  or  PDSN,   is  a  component  of a<br>
CDMA2000 mobile network. It acts as the connection point between the Radio Access and IP networks. This component is responsible for managing point-to-point protocol (PPP) sessions between the mobile provider's core IP network and the mobile station (read mobile phone). The PDSN also provides packet filtering functions and provides QoS connection for IP flows with Access Network. It is similar in function to the GGSN (GPRS Gateway Support Node) that is found in GSM and UMTS networks. The PDSN can be thought of being similar to GGSN in a conceptual sense. Logically, it can also be considered to be a combination of Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and GGSN in the CDMA world. The PDSN provides: (a) Mobility management functions (provided by SGSN in the GPRS/UMTS networks); and (b) Packet routing functionality (provided by GGSN in the GPRS/UMTS networks).<br>
[0007]	Challenges exist in that the serving PDSN 108 is significantly removed<br>
from the communication chain to the access terminal 106. Challenges also exist in that some IP functions of PDSN108 is moved to the radio access network (104) such as packet filtering functions and QoS control function. The usage data of data sent over the air (OTA) 122 that the RAN 104 can monitor is more accurate as compared to data<br>
 <br>
124 that is often received by the PDSN 108. The conventional PDSN accounting architecture presents issues with regard to accounting accuracy, On forward link with the PDSN counting packets, the data is not sent from the base station to the mobile station due to over-the-air resource constraints, and thus the accounting is inaccurate. In the reverse link, if the data is received from the mobile station to the base station and if the data is lost on backhaul, the reserve data will not be counted by the PDSN even through the air interface has consumed resources,<br>
SUMMARY<br>

functions are handled by the eBSs and the AGW to increase accuracy of accounting<br>
reporting and reducing an amount of accounting reporting to a core network. These<br>
functions distributed to the eBSs and AGWs include measuring and counting of a<br>
quantity of data sent and received by an eBS tracked on behalf of an access terminal<br>
(AT) or an amount of connected radio air time that an AT uses for a reservation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
[0024] In a converged communication network, a core network provides Internet protocol (IP) data packet services to access terminals via radio access nodes (RAN). By positioning accounting report triggering closer to the usage by the access terminal, accuracy and comprehensive of accounting is achieved, which can also reduce overhead burdens on the core network. In particular, additional responsibility is given lo an access gateway (AGW) between an enhanced base station (eBS) of the RAN and the core network that can reduce the volume and increase the accuracy of accounting message traffic to an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) server of the core network. The AGW informs the eBS of accounting rules to be used in making air link records that are merged and formatted in accordance with an accounting protocol for sending to the AAA server. Different types of accounting needs are supported and enhanced by the AGW/RAN, including duration based accounting (e.g., VoIP, video telephony, etc.), volume based accounting (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.). Different types of accounting are supported, including postpaid and prepaid. Different accounting categories are supported by the AGW/RAN, including user based accounting, serve based accounting, and flow based accounting. Different accounting protocols can be supported by the AGW/RAN, including DIAMETER protocol or RADIUS protocol. [0025] Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects.   It may be<br>
 <br>
evident, however, that the various aspects may be practiced without these specific details, In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing these aspects.<br>
[0026] Turning to the Drawings, in FIG. 2, a converged communication system 200 provides IP data packet service from a core network 202 to a radio access network 204 for an access terminal (AT) 206 via an air link 207. An access gateway (AGW) 212 provides accounting rules 214 to the RAN 204. which in turn provides air link records 216 regarding data packet usage by the AT 206. The AGW 212 merges the air link records 216 in a usage data record 218 formatted in accordance with an accounting protocol (e.g., Diameter, RADIUS, etc.) and transmitted to an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server 220,<br>
[0027] The AGW 212 provides this functionality with one or more eBS 204 that in turn provide various functions, A forward-link serving eBS (ELSE) is a serving eBS 204 for the forward-link physical layer. A reverse-link serving eBS (RLSE) is a serving eBS 204 for the reverse-link physical layer. A signaling radio network controller (SRNC) is a session anchor eBS 206 that stores the session information for the AT 206 and serves as a permanent route to the AT. A data attachment point (DAP) is a receiving eBS for all the data packets from the AGW. Additionally, an eBS can have visibility into the user's IP packets, perform packet filtering, and can optimize over-lhe-air (OTA) scheduling or perform other value-added functions.<br>
[0028] The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms "system" and "network" are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. CDMA2000 covers IS-2000. IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM®, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an upcoming release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTEand GSM are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation<br>
 <br>
Partnership Project" (3GPP). CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art.<br>
[0029] FIGS. 3 and 5 illustrate methodologies and/or flow diagrams in accordance with the claimed subject matter. For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are depicted and described as a series of acts. It is to be understood and appreciated that the subject technology is not limited by the acts illustrated and/or by the order of acts. For example, acts can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methodologies in accordance with the claimed subject matter. In addition, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methodologies could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. <br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 3, a methodology 300 provides enhanced accounting for data packet usage data for an access terminal (AT) 302 to an enhanced base station 1 (eBSl) 304, that serves as the FLSE, RLSE and DAP, and on occasion to an eBS2 306, with a session maintained by an SRNC 308. An access gateway (AGW) 310 coordinates between these radio access network (RAN) elements and a home AAA server 312 of the core network. The AT 302 performs successful Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), a transport protocol for different authentication algorithms, access authentication and authorization with the SRNC 308, which in turn entails successful access authentication as depicted at 322 with the AGW 310 and the HAAA 312 as depicted at 324.<br>
[0031] The AT 302 adds eBSl 304 in the Route Set and triggers online/offline signature scheme (IOS) signaling exchanged between eBSl 304 and the SRNC 308 as depicted at 326. The SRNC 308 sends session information to eBSl 304. As depicted at 328, the eBSl 304 sends Link ID to the AT 302. At this time, eBSl 304 serves as both FLSE (Forward Link Serving eBS) and RLSE (Reverse Link Serving eBS). At 330, the eBSl 304 creates an air link record. At 332, the eBSl 304 sends an accounting request (ACR) {Start Record) to the AGW 310. At 334, the AGW 310 creates a UDR for ATs<br>
 <br>
IP address. At 336, the AGW 310 sends an accounting answer (ACA). At 338, the AT 302 requests eBSI 304 to be the DAP (Data Attachment Point) or the network decides that eBSl 304 should be DAP. At 340, the eBSI 304 triggers the primary proxy mobile IP (PM1P) funnel establishment between eBSI 304 and AGW 310. At 342, the AT 302 and AGW 310 perform IP address assignment. At 344, the AGW 310 sends Accounting-Request (Start) including the created UDR to the HAAA 312. At 346, the HAAA sends Accounting-Response to the AGW. At 348, data can flow between AT 302 and eBS 1 304, and in turn at 350 at AGW 310.<br>
[0032] The UDR format with regard to communication from the eBS (air link) can comprise a user identifier, such as NAI (Network Access Identifier), infrastructure identifiers, such as ANTD (anonymous ID), common session activity data, such as event time and total active connection time, and flow activity data, such as event time, reservation label, packet filters, data octet count for origination, data octet count for termination, granted quality of service (QoS), and reservation used time. [0033] The UDR format with regard to the AGW can comprise user identifiers, such as NAI and IP address, infrastructure identifiers, such as carrier ID, AGW address, foreign agent (FA) address, and home agent (HA) address, a common session activity, such as event time, total data session time, inbound common management information protocol (CMIP) signaling octet count, outbound CMIP signaling octet count, filtered octet count at origination, and filtered octet count at termination, and an access node record, such an anonymous identifier and a flow activity, such as an event lime, reservation label, packet filters, data octet count at origination, data octet count at termination, granted qualify of service, and reservation used time. [0034] It should be appreciated that prepaid coupons can be implemented by the AGW 310 without requiring to perform packet filtering,<br>
[0035] At 352, the AT 302 adds an eBS2 306 into the Route Set. The eBS2 306 gets session information from the SRNC 308 through IOS signaling. At 354, the eBS2 306 sends Link ID to the AT 302. At 356, the eBS2 306 creates an air link record 2. In one aspect as depicted, it is desirable for accounting start and stop to come from the same eBS. When an eBS is added in the Route Set, that eBS sends an Account Start to the AGW 310, as depicted at 358, which results in the AGW 310 responding with an Accounting Answer at 360. As will be described below, when an eBS is dropped from the Route Set, the eBS sends an Account Stop to the AGW 310, which is not event trigger.    Alternatively, the steps depicted at 358 and 360 can be omitted when an<br>
 <br>
accounting start can come from one eBS and accounting start can come from another eBS.<br>
[0036] At block 362, the AT 302 performs L2 switching and DAP move between eBSl 304 and eBS2 306. At 364, the eBSl 304 sends an accounting-request (interim Record 1 (AR1)} to the AGW 310, which in turn responds with an ACA at 366. At 368, the eBS2 306 also sends an accounting request (interim record (AR2)} at 370. [0037] Sometime later, the AT 302 wants to remove eBS2 306 from the Route Set, as depicted at 372. The AT 302 and eBS2 306 perform Route Close procedures a! 374, which prompts the eBS2 306 to send an ACR (Stop Record) at 376 to the AGW 310, which responds with an ACA at 378.<br>
[0038] The AGW 310 can send interim accounting report io the HAAA 312 periodically, as depicted at 380, which responds with an ACA at 382. The interim accounting period is based on the interim interval parameter received from HAAA 312 via EAP Access Authentication and Authorization procedures or is based on local policy if interim-interval parameter is not received from HAAA 3 3 2. [0039] Sometime later, the AT 302 releases the connection at block 384. At 386, the AT 302 and eBSl 304 perform connection close procedures, prompting the eBSl 304 to send an ACR (Stop Record) at 388 to the AGW 310, which responds with an ACA at 390. Two scenarios can occur, In a first scenario as depicted, the IP address is released at block 392 before the Primary PMIP Tunnel is released at block 394. Sometime later, the AT's IP address is released. In a second scenario that is not depicted, the Primary PMIP Tunnel is released before IP address is released. At 396, the AGW 310 sends the Accounting Stop to the HAAA 312 for each IP session accounting. At 398, the HAAA 312 sends the Accounting Response to the AGW 310. [0040] Referring to FIG. 4, another exemplary converged communication system 400 provides IP data packet service from a visited core network 402 to a radio access network 404 for an access terminal (AT) 406 via an air link 407. The AT 406 maintains the air link 407 with an eBSl 408, an eBS2 409 and an SRNC 410 as the RAN 404 that interacts through an access gateway (AGW) 412 to accounting reporting. In particular, the illustrative communication system 400 further includes a home core network 416 that provides.multiple payment types, including prepaid and postpaid. [0041] For postpaid data packet services, a home Policy Charging Rules Function (PCRF) 418 provides charging rules 420 to a home agent 422 and then to a home AAA server 424.  The home PCRF 418 also provides charging rules 426 to a visited PCRF<br>
 <br>
428 and then in turn at 429 to the visited AGW 412, both of the visited cove network 402. The AGW 412 can then prepare charging rules 430 to IheeBSl 408. [0042] A user 432 purchases a prepaid coupon, as depicted at 434, that is communicated as prepaid coupon (PC) information 436 to a prepaid server 438 of the home core network 416, which in turn provides PC information 440 to the home AAA server 424. The prepaid server 438 communicates with an application server 442 that communicates with the home PCRF 416. The home AAA server 424 communicates PC information 444 to a visited AAA server 446 of the visited core network 402. The visited AAA server 446 sends PC information 448 to the visited AGW 412 that prepares prepaid rules 450 for (he eBS I 408.<br>
[0043] Referring to FIG. 5, a methodology 500 for accounting data usage by an AT 502 by an access node 504 and AGW 508 to report to a core network 510. which includes an AAA function. At 520, the AT initiates a communication session specifying or associated with a prepaid coupon. At this point or previously, the core network 510 receives the prepaid coupon at 522. The prepaid coupon information is relayed to the AGW 508 at 524, which in turn processes prepaid rules 526 for transmission at 528 as large interval prepaid rule to the access node (AN) 504. Data can then be exchanged utilizing this prepaid authorization between the AT 502 and AN 504 at 530, between the AN 504 and AGW 508 at 532, and between the AGW 508 and the core network 510 at 534. In accordance with the large interval prepaid rule, the AN 504 sends a large interval accounting record at 536 to the AGW 508. The AGW 508 decreases the prepaid coupon at 538 as a leftover coupon. After some iterations of this accounting reporting, the AGW 508 determines at 540 that the leftover prepaid coupon is now small (e.g., 10% remaining, 1 minute remaining, SI remaining, etc.). In response, the AGW 508 sends a small interval prepaid rule 542 to the AN 504. Data can then continue to be exchanged between the AT 502 and AN 504 at 544, between the AN 504 and AGW 508 at 546, and between the AGW 508 and the core network 510 at 548. In accordance with the small interval prepaid rule, the AN 504 sends a small interval accounting record at 550 to the AGW 508. The AGW 508 decreases the prepaid coupon at 552. After some iterations of this accounting reporting, the AGW 508 determines at 554 that the leftover prepaid coupon is now exhausted. The AGW 508 makes a determination as to whether IP flow packets are not to be sent or to be sent as block error (BE) at 556 and then sends this disabling prepaid rule at 558 to the AN 504.<br>
 <br>
[0044] Referring to FIG. 6, a multiple access wireless communication system according to one aspect is illustrated. An access point 700 (AP) includes multiple antenna groups, one including 704 and 706, another including 708 and 710, and an additional including 712 and 714. In FIG. 6, only two antennas are shown for each antenna group, however, more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each antenna group. Access terminal 716 (AT) is in communication with antennas 712 and 714, where antennas 712 and 714 transmit information to access terminal 716 over forward link 720 and receive information from access terminal 716 over reverse link 718. Access terminal 722 is in communication with antennas 706 and 708, where antennas 706 and 708 transmit information to access terminal 722 over forward link 726 and receive information from access terminal 722 over reverse link 724. In a FDD system, communication links 718, 720, 724 and 726 may use different frequency for communication. For example, forward link 720 may use a different frequency then that used by reverse link 718.<br>
[0045] Each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designed to communicate is often referred to as a sector of the access point. In the aspect, antenna groups each are designed to communicate to access terminals in a sector of the areas covered by access point 700.<br>
[0046] In communication over forward links 720 and 726, the transmitting antennas of access point 700 utilize beam forming in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of forward links for the different access terminals 716 and 724, In addition, an access point using beam forming to transmit to access terminals scattered randomly through its coverage causes less interference to access terminals in neighboring cells than an access point transmitting through a single antenna to all its access terminals.<br>
[0047] An access point may be a fixed station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, or some other terminology, An access terminal may also be called user equipment (UE), a wireless communication device, terminal, or some other terminology.<br>
[0048] FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an aspect of a transmitter system 810 (also known as the access point) and a receiver system 850 (also known as access terminal) in a MIMO system 800. At the transmitter system 810, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source 812 to a transmitter (TX) data processor 814.<br>
 <br>
[0049] In an aspect, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor 814 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0050] The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK. QSPK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor 830.<br>
[0051] The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor 820, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 820 then provides Nr modulation symbol streams to Nr transmitters (TMTR) 822a through 822t. In certain implementations, TX MIMO processor 820 applies beam-forming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0052] Each transmitter 822 receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, fillers, and up converts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. /V-,-modulated signals from transmitters 822a through 822t are then transmitted from NTantennas 824a through 824t, respectively,<br>
[0053] At receiver system 850, the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR antennas 852a through 852r and the received signal from each antenna 852 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 854a through 854r. Each receiver 854 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and down converts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0054] An RX data processor 860 then receives and processes the NR received symbol streams from NR receivers 854 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide Nr "detected" symbol streams.  The RX data processor 860 then<br>
 <br>
demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream, The processing by RX data processor 860 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 820 and TX data processor 814 at transmitter system 810.<br>
[0055] A processor 870 periodically determines which pre-coding matrix (o use (discussed below). Processor 870 formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0056] The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor 838, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 836, modulated by a modulator 880, conditioned by transmitters 854a through 854r, and transmitted back to transmitter system 810.<br>
[0057] At transmitter system 810, the modulated signals from receiver system 850 are received by antennas 824, conditioned by receivers 822, demodulated by a demodulator 840, and processed by a RX data processor 842 to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system 850. Processor 830 then determines which pre-coding matrix to use for determining the beam forming weights then processes the extracted message.<br>
