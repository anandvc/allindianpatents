DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
In the case of using a basic metal salt as a catalyst for a condensation reaction,<br>
it is necessary to add steps of neutralizing the basic metal salt remaining after<br>
completion of the reaction, and removing salts formed thereby by means of<br>
filtration or the like. In addition, in order to completely neutralize the basic<br>
metal salt, a slightly excess amount of an acidic substance is generally used.<br>
In this case, it is necessary to add the step of removing the excess amount of<br>
the acidic substance after completion of the neutralization. As described<br>
above, the method for producing an organopolysiloxane by means of a<br>
condensation reaction with a catalyst of a basic metal salt has problems in that<br>
the steps are complicated and waste products are increased.<br>
[0007]<br>
On the other hand, in the ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic siloxane with<br>
a low molecular weight using a tetramethylammonium hydroxide compound as<br>
a catalyst, the aforementioned problems in the case of using the basic metal<br>
salt can be eluded. However, use of the tetramethylammonium hydroxide<br>
compound as a catalyst of a dealcoholization condensation reaction which is<br>
completely different from a ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic compound<br>
has not been studied heretofore. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide used in<br>
the Examples of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication<br>
No. 2006-328231 is involved in the reaction for dehydration condensation of a<br>
silanol obtained by hydrolyzing an alkoxysilane, and is not used as a catalyst<br>
for a dealcoholization condensation reaction<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition, in the case of making a diorganopolysiloxane with a low molecular<br>
weight in which both terminals of the molecular chain thereof are blocked with<br>
hydroxy groups have a high molecular weight, using a reaction mixture of a<br>
quaternary phosphonium hydroxide compound and a diorganosiloxane with a<br>
low molecular weight, as a catalyst, the reaction is a condensation reaction<br>
between silicon atom-bonded hydroxy groups. For this reason, the conditions<br>
of high temperature and reduced pressure are required, and a large amount of<br>
the catalyst must be used. Therefore, the production steps are complicated.<br>
In addition, a quaternary phosphonium hydroxide compound remains in the<br>
system even after the activity of the compound disappears due to heat, and it<br>
is difficult to remove the compound. For this reason, purity of a product is<br>
reduced, and the catalyst cannot be used in usage in which high purity is<br>
required or usage accompanied with a hydrosilylation reaction since catalyst<br>
poisoning is exhibited. Therefore, there are the aforementioned problems.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention is performed under the circumstances of the prior art as<br>
described above. An objective of the present invention is to provide a catalyst<br>
for a dealcoholization condensation reaction in which it is not necessary to use<br>
a large amount of the catalyst, and removal of the catalyst after use is easily<br>
carried out, and thereby, establishing a method for producing an<br>
organopolysiloxane in which waste products are reduced, and complicated<br>
production steps are not necessary.<br>

waste products can be controlled.<br>
[0016]<br>

producing an organopolysiloxane according to the present invention is not<br>
performed via a condensation reaction between hydroxy groups. For this<br>
reason, reaction conditions of high temperature and reduced pressure can be<br>
alleviated. In view of this, complication of production steps can be eluded.<br>
[0017]<br>
Therefore, the catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction and the<br>
method for producing an organopolysiloxane using the same according to the<br>
present invention are practically advantageous, and environmental burden can<br>
be reduced.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]<br>
The catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction according to the<br>
present invention promotes a dealcoholization condensation reaction between<br>
a silicon atom-bonded hydroxy group and a silicon atom-bonded alkoxy group,<br>
and comprises a quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound. The term<br>
"comprise" used herein means not only the case of consisting of only a<br>
quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound, but also the case of<br>
containing a quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound as the main<br>
catalyst component and other additional components.<br>
[0019]<br>
The quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound is not particularly limited<br>
as long as a quaternary ammonium group is possessed. The compound is<br>
preferably basic. As examples of a basic compound having a quaternary<br>
ammonium ion, mention may be made of an alkylammonium hydroxide<br>
compound.<br>
[0020]<br>
As the alkyl group forming the alkylammonium hydroxide compound, an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms is preferable, and examples thereof include<br>
a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, and the like. A reduced<br>
number of the carbon atoms is preferable, and in particular, a methyl group is<br>
preferable. Therefore, as examples of alkylammonium hydroxide compounds,<br>
mention may be made of tetramethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and the like. In particular,<br>
tetramethylammonium hydroxide is preferable.<br>
[0021]<br>
A silanolate of an alkylammonium hydroxide compound can also be used as<br>
the quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound.<br>
[0022]<br>
As examples of silanolates of the alkylammonium hydroxide compounds,<br>
mention may be made of, for example, tetramethylammonium<br>
trimethylsilanolate, tetraethylammonium trimethylsilanolate,<br>
tetrapropylammonium trimethylsilanolate, tetramethylammonium<br>
triethylsilanolate, tetraethylammonium triethylsilanolate, tetrapropylammonium<br>
triethylsilanolate, tetramethylammonium tripropylsilanolate,<br>
tetraethylammonium tripropylsilanolate, tetrapropylammonium<br>
tripropylsilanolate, and the like. In particular, tetramethylammonium<br>
trimethylsilanolate, {(CH3)4N-OSi(CH3)3}, is preferable. As the<br>
aforementioned silanolates, those produced by any method can be used. For<br>
example, the silanolates can be prepared by a dehydration reaction between a<br>
tetraalkylammonium hydroxide compound and a silanol compound.<br>
[0023]<br>
As a silanolate of an alkylammonium hydroxide compound, a reaction mixture<br>
between an alkylammonium hydroxide compound and an organopolysiloxane<br>
can also be used. The organopolysiloxane is not particularly limited as long<br>
as it can react with the hydroxy group of the alkylammonium hydroxide<br>
compound. As examples of organopolysiloxanes, mention may be made of,<br>
for example, straight-chain polysiloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane,<br>
octamethyltrisiloxane, and the like; cyclic siloxanes such as<br>
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane,<br>
hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, and the like; and the like. Preferable examples of<br>
the reaction mixture are represented by the following formula:<br><br>
wherein<br>
n is an integer of one or more.<br>
[0024]<br>
The catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction according to the<br>
present invention may be used as a single type of a quaternary ammonium<br>
ion-containing compound, or in combination with two or more types thereof.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the case of using a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide compound as a<br>
quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound, any tetraalkylammonium<br>
hydroxide compounds produced by any methods can be used. For example,<br>
a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide compound can be produced by means of an<br>
electrolysis method in which an aqueous solution of a tetraalkylammonium<br>
compound such as tetraalkylammonium halide is supplied to a positive<br>
electrode chamber of an electrolytic cell which is distinguished between the<br>
positive electrode chamber and a negative electrode chamber by a<br>
fluorocarbon-based positive ion exchange membrane, electrolysis is carried<br>
out while water is being provided to the aforementioned positive electrode<br>
chamber, and subsequently, an aqueous solution of a tetraalkylammonium<br>
hydroxide is extracted from the negative electrode chamber, as described in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. S61-190085.<br>
[0026]<br>
The aforementioned tetraalkylammonium hydroxide compound is preferably<br>
used by diluting in a suitable solvent in view of stability, and is, in particular, in<br>
the form of an aqueous solution or an alcohol solution.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the method for producing an organopolysiloxane of the present invention, an<br>
organopolysiloxane is synthesized by means of a dealcoholization<br>
condensation reaction between a silicon atom-bonded hydroxy group and a<br>
silicon atom-bonded alkoxy group in the presence of a quaternary ammonium<br>
ion-containing compound, as a catalyst, which is preferably an alkylammonium<br>
hydroxide compound or a silanolate thereof. In the method for producing the<br>
organopolysiloxane of the present invention, the organopolysiloxane can be<br>
easily produced since the method is performed not via a condensation reaction<br>
between silicon atom-bonded hydroxy groups, which requires the conditions of<br>
high temperature and reduced pressure.<br>
[0028]<br>
For example, according to the present invention, a compound represented by<br>
the following average structural formula (I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
each of R1 and R2 independently represents a monovalent hydrocarbon<br>
group;0 = a 
+ c) 
is subjected to a dealcoholization condensation reaction in the presence of a<br>
quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound, and thereby, an<br>
organopolysiloxane represented by the following average structural formula<br>
(II):<br><br>

an undecyl group, a dodecyl group, a tetradecyl group, a hexadecyl group, and<br>
an octadecyl group.<br>
[0031]<br>
As examples of the aforementioned straight-chain, branched or cyclic alkenyl<br>
groups, mention may be made of, for example, a vinyl group, an allyl group, a<br>
butenyl group, a hexenyl group, and the like.<br>

phenyl group, a tolyl group, a naphthyl group, and the like.<br>
[0033]<br>
As examples of the aforementioned arylalkyl groups, mention may be made of<br>

substituted. In the case of substituted hydrocarbon groups, as examples of<br>
the substituents, mention may be made of, for example, a halogen atom such<br>
as a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, an iodine atom, or the<br>
like; an alkoxy group such as a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, a propoxy<br>
group, or the like; a cyano group; and the like. Therefore, as examples of the<br>
substituted hydrocarbon groups, mention may be made of, for example, a 3-<br>
chloropropyltrimethoxy group, a 3-bromopropyl group, a 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl<br>
group, a cyanoethyl group, and the like.<br>
[0035]<br>
A method for producing an acyclic compound represented by the<br>
aforementioned average structural formula (I) is not particularly limited. For<br>
example, an alkoxysilane represented by the following general formula (III):<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are the same as described above;<br>
a' is 0, 1, 2 or 3; b' is 1, 2, 3 or 4, with the proviso that (a' + b') = 4,<br>
is hydrolyzed, and thereby, the aforementioned acyclic compound can be<br>
obtained. The alkoxysilanes represented by the aforementioned general<br>

[0042]<br>
The usage amount of the catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction<br>
formed from the quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound in the<br>
method for producing an organopolysiloxane of the present invention may be<br>
an amount by which the silicon atom-bonded hydroxy group or the silicon<br>
atom-bonded alkoxy group of the starting substances can interact with each<br>
other. In general, the catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction is<br>
preferably used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 100,000 ppm, and preferably<br>
ranging from 10 to 10,000 ppm, with respect to the weight of the starting<br>
materials. If the usage amount thereof is below 0.5 ppm, the rate of the<br>
condensation reaction may be extremely reduced. On the other hand, if the<br>
usage amount exceeds 100,000 ppm, excessive time may be required in order<br>
to remove the catalyst after the condensation reaction.<br>
[0043]<br>
The dealcoholization condensation reaction in the method for producing an<br>
organopolysiloxane of the present invention is preferably carried out at a<br>
temperature which is equal to or lower than the thermal decomposition<br>
temperature of the catalyst for a dealcoholization condensation reaction<br>
comprising the quaternary ammonium ion-containing compound. In general,<br>
the aforementioned reaction is carried out at not more than 120°C and more<br>
preferably not more than 100°C, although the thermal decomposition<br>
temperature of the aforementioned catalyst varies depending on the types of<br>
the aforementioned catalysts.<br>
[0044]<br>
The reaction pressure of the aforementioned dealcoholization condensation<br>
reaction is not particularly limited. Normal pressure is preferably in view of<br>
operationability.<br>
[0045]<br>
In the method for producing an organopolysiloxane of the present invention,<br>
after the aforementioned dealcoholization, the remaining catalyst is preferably<br>
removed. The removal of the remaining catalyst can be carried out by, for<br>
example, heating the aforementioned catalyst to a temperature which is equal<br>
to or higher than the thermal decomposition temperature of the quaternary<br>
ammonium ion-containing compound which forms the aforementioned catalyst<br>
to obtain substances with a low boiling temperature, and subsequently<br>
removing the substances from the reaction system by means of an operation<br>
under reduced pressure or the like. The heating temperature is, for example,<br>
equal to or higher than 120°C, and preferably equal to or higher than 130°C.<br>
[0046]<br>
For example, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide is thermally decomposed to<br>
compounds with a low boiling point such as an amine (such as trimethylamine)<br>
and an alcohol (such as methanol) at a temperature which is equal to or higher<br>
than the thermal decomposition temperature by means of a reaction shown by<br>
the following scheme:<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents an alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl<br>
group, or the like.<br>
In addition, the compounds with a low boiling point can be easily removed<br>
under reduced pressure. For this reason, the tetraalkyiammonium hydroxide<br>
remaining in the reaction system can be easiiy removed. The thermal<br>
decomposition reaction of the tetraalkyiammonium hydroxide is carried out<br>
under reduced pressure and thereby, the removal of the compounds with a low<br>
boiling point produced by the thermal decomposition may be promoted, if<br>
necessary.<br>
[0047]<br>
As described above, in the present invention, a neutralization step is not<br>
required for removal of the remaining catalyst after the reaction. For this<br>
reason, complication of the steps of producing an organopolysiloxane and<br>
increase of waste products can be eluded. Therefore, the catalyst for a<br>
dealcoholization condensation reaction comprising the quaternary ammonium<br>
ion-containing compound in the present invention is practically advantageous.<br>
[0048]<br>
The organopolysiloxane represented by the aforementioned average structural<br>
formula (II) or (VI) which is obtained by the dealcoholization condensation<br>
reaction is a straight-chain or branched organopolysiloxane or organosiloxane<br>
oligomer, and in general, has a molecular weight ranging from 162 to<br>
1,000,000. In addition, the outer appearance of the organopolysiloxane<br>
represented by the aforementioned average structural formula (II) or (VI) may<br>
vary in the form of an oil, a gum, or a resin, depending of the molecular weight<br>
and molecular structure thereof.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0049]<br>
The organopolysiloxane represented by the aforementioned average structural<br>
formula (II) or (VI) which is obtained by the method for producing the same of<br>
the present invention can be suitably used in various usages.<br>
[0050]<br>
In particular, when the organopolysiloxane represented by the aforementioned<br>
average structural formula (II) or (VI) has an alkoxy group, a reaction such as<br>
crosslinking or the like can be carried out by using the aforementioned alkoxy<br>
group as a reaction point. Therefore, by use of the organopolysiloxane<br>
represented by the aforementioned average structural formula (II) or (VI), a<br>
