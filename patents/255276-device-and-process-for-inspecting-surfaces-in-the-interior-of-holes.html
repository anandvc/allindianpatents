DEVICE AND PROCESS FOR INSPECTING<br>
SURFACES IN THE INTERIOR OF HOLES<br>
The invention relates to a device for inspecting surfaces<br>
in the interior of holes, recesses, or the like, where the<br>
device comprises a light source for producing a light beam,<br>
where the light beam can be focused by imaging optics, where the<br>
focused light beam can be deflected onto the surface, and where<br>
a sensor device is provided for detecting the reflected light<br>
beam<br>
Surface inspections in the interior of holes, recesses, or<br>
the like, in particular of boreholes or small cracks with<br>
dimensions in the millimeter range, represent an important task<br>
in many fields of technology. Qualitatively high-value and<br>
close-tolerance bore holes are frequently needed when they are<br>
provided to receive movable parts such as pins, cylinders, or<br>
small pistons, eg in pressure valves Pressure valves are used<br>
in pneumatics but also in other fields such as in automobile<br>
technology for fuel injection. There in the meantime, test pins<br>
for electrical circuits with pneumatic cylinders with a diameter<br>
of 2 mm are finding application. These very small cylinders are<br>
necessary in order to keep up with electrical circuits which are<br>
constantly getting smaller. Close-tolerance bore holes are also<br>
required for shrink connections, where said bore holes cannot be<br>
allowed to be subject to damage due to burrs or bubbles<br>
Moreover, it can also be of importance in holes outside of the<br>
millimeter range to know the surface quality precisely Thus,<br>
for example, brake cylinders in a motor vehicle must have a<br>
particularly high-quality surface since small chips or burrs in<br>
the cylinders can lead to the destruction of the parts after<br>
even a short time<br><br>
For the inspection of surfaces, essentially two processes<br>
are used in practice at present. In one system a glass wedge<br>
forms optics with which nearly 360° of the surrounding surface<br>
can be imaged on a light wave guide bundle The light wave guide<br>
bundle frequently comprises several thousand individual fibers<br>
which together conduct an image to a camera By suitable image<br>
processing, structures on the surface can be recognized thereby<br>
Their actual size, in particular their three-dimensional<br>
extension, cannot be determined however.<br>
In another technology customary in practice a monochromatic<br>
light beam is deflected onto the surface to be examined, where<br>
this light beam is always kept focused on the surface. If the<br>
distance between the optics and the illuminated image point<br>
changes as a consequence of unevenness of the surface and thus<br>
the light beam is no longer focused, then an automatic focusing<br>
circuit adjusts the optics in such a manner that the light beam<br>
is once again focused on the surface. Via this correction of the<br>
optics the change in distance can be detected. In this way the<br>
surface can indeed be measured in three dimensions, but due to<br>
the necessary tracking of the focusing only relatively slow<br>
measurement speeds can be achieved An inspection in a running<br>
production process thus cannot be realized.<br>
The present invention is thus based on the objective of<br>
developing and extending a device of the type stated in the<br>
introduction in such a manner that, as far as possible, a rapid,<br>
simple, and reproducible inspection of surfaces in the interior<br>
of holes, recesses, or the like is possible with dimensioning up<br>
into the millimeter range and with the simplest construction.<br>
Furthermore, a corresponding process will be specified<br>
According to the invention the above objective is realized<br>
by the features of claim 1. According thereto, the device under<br>
discussion is developed in such a manner that a multicolor laght<br><br>
beam can be produced with the light source, said light beam, due<br>
to the chromatic aberration of the imaging optics, being focused<br>
onto several points at different distances from the imaging<br>
optics, and that from the spectrum of the detected light beam<br>
the distance to the surface can be determined.<br>
With regard to the process, the above objective is realized<br>
by the features of claim 17. According thereto, the process<br>
under discussion is characterized by the fact that with the<br>
light source a multicolor light beam is produced which, due to<br>
the chromatic aberration of the imaging optics, is focused onto<br>
several points at different distances from the imaging optics,<br>
and that from the spectrum of the detected light beam the<br>
distance to the surface can be determined.<br>
In the manner according to the invention it has first been<br>
recognized that the re-focusing of the optics can be omitted<br>
Turning away from the process known in practice, multicolor<br>
light is intentionally used and, arising thereby and frequently<br>
undesirable, the chromatic aberration associated with multicolor<br>
light is exploited in the optics. Due to the chromatic<br>
aberration, light beams of different wave lengths are focused<br>
onto different focal points. Depending on the degree of<br>
chromatic aberration, these focal points lie in a more or less<br>
widely extended area and at a greater or lesser distance from<br>
the imaging optics on the optical axis of the imaging optics<br>
Since those spectral fractions which are essentially focused on<br>
the illuminated point of the surface are reflected best by the<br>
irradiated surface, conclusions about the distance between the<br>
optics and the illuminated image point can be drawn according to<br>
the invention from a spectral analysis of the reflected light<br>
beam If an entire area on the surface is scanned by deflecting<br>
the focused light beam, then a profile concerning the condition<br>
of the surface can be developed in this manner<br><br>
The device according to the invention and the process<br>
according to the invention can be used in an advantageous manner<br>
anywhere that surfaces have to be measured in surroundings which<br>
are very restricted spatially. Thus, for example, bore holes,<br>
but also depressions, cracks, or other recesses, can be<br>
measured.<br>
According to the invention a multicolor light beam is<br>
produced for this purpose which is preferably conducted via one<br>
or more light wave guides to imaging optics. This is preferably<br>
white light since a particularly simple situation with regard to<br>
the evaluation of the spectral fractions results thereby. The<br>
imaging optics comprises in an advantageous manner a lens or a<br>
system of lenses<br>
With regard to a miniaturization which is as simple as<br>
possible and imaging optics which is as economical as possible,<br>
said imaging optics preferably comprises a GRIN (gradient index)<br>
lens GRIN lenses usually consist of cylindrical blocks which<br>
are provided by special production processes with a continuous<br>
radial change in the index of refraction. In so doing, the same<br>
effects are obtained on a light beam passing through the lens as<br>
with conventional lenses However, GRIN lenses can be<br>
miniaturized significantly further with lower production costs,<br>
which is of great advantage in particular in spatially<br>
restricted surroundings.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner the GRIN lens can be<br>
assigned to a positioning device, a so-called spacer, with which<br>
the aberration of the lens can be adapted. With this, a lens of<br>
this type can be adapted particularly simply to changed system<br>
configurations.<br>
In measurement situations in which greater distances<br>
between the optics and the measured object must be overcome, the<br>
GRIN lens can be connected later to additional optics Here, for<br><br>
example, imaging optics known in the case of aspheric telescopes<br>
can be used In an advantageous manner, for example, a light<br>
wave guide can be coupled between the lenses of the telescope<br>
optics to deflect light into the beam path, whereby still<br>
greater coverage is possible<br>
With regard to a particularly simple deflectability of the<br>
focused light beam, a deflecting device could be provided which<br>
preferably is structured in such a manner that it can be moved<br>
In this connection, prisms, mirrors, or also plane-parallel<br>
plates are used. Advantageously the deflecting device is adapted<br>
to achieve reproducible measurement processes through<br>
electrical, piezoelectric, magnetic, or comparable positioning<br>
elements, which preferably are driven by an electronic circuit,<br>
e g. a microcontroller. By suitable control of the deflecting<br>
device the entire surface, or at least a part of the surface, in<br>
the interior of a hole, specifically the part to be inspected,<br>
can be illuminated and measured. In so doing, the light beam can<br>
be guided in a linear, circular, spiral, meandering, or any<br>
other suitable manner.<br>
With regard to a particularly simple and space-saving<br>
development of the device, the reflected light beam could take<br>
the same path as the light beam produced by the light source,<br>
only in the reverse direction. At a suitable point the reflected<br>
light beam could be separated by an optical separating filter<br>
and conducted to a sensor device<br>
The sensor device advantageously comprises an electronic<br>
component which is in the position to convert multicolor light,<br>
depending on the spectrum of the incident light beam, into<br>
suitable electrical signals. Preferably, a CCD chip or other<br>
photodetector arrays are used here<br>
The device according to the invention can be operated in a<br>
relatively simple manner as a multi-channel system, whereby<br><br>
several measurements can be carried out simultaneously In so<br>
doing, the light exiting from the imaging optics can be divided<br>
onto several measurement points and the respective reflections<br>
of the measurement points conducted via, preferably several,<br>
light wave guides In a particularly advantageous manner when so<br>
doing, the measurement points are disposed depending on the<br>
measurement situation Here a disposition in the form of a row<br>
and a circle would be conceivable<br>
With regard to a particularly versatile evaluation<br>
capability of the signals obtained by the sensor device, they<br>
could be conducted to an electronic device which, for example,<br>
comprises a digital computer in the form of a microcontroller or<br>
a digital signal processor. With this, signal processing can be<br>
carried out and the data obtained prepared in a suitable manner<br>
for later use, e.g a visualization. Perhaps evaluation of<br>
measurement results could also be done here and the surface<br>
classified according to certain criteria.<br>
There are various possibilities for developing and<br>
extending the teaching of the present invention in an<br>
advantageous manner. For this, reference is made, on the one<br>
hand, to the claims subordinate to claims 1 and 17 and, on the<br>
other hand, to the following explanation of preferred embodiment<br>
examples of the invention with the aid of the drawings In<br>
connection with the explanation of the preferred embodiment<br>
examples of the invention with the aid of the drawings,<br>
preferred developments and extensions of the teaching are also<br>
explained in general In the accompanying drawings. <br>
FIG 1 shows in a schematic view a conceptual layout of a<br>
device according to the invention,<br>
FIG. 2 shows m a schematic view the use of a GRIN lens in<br>
connection with a lens system, and<br><br>
FIG 3 shows in a schematic view a deflecting device with a<br>
plane-parallel plate<br>
FIG 1 shows in a schematic representation a conceptual<br>
layout of a device 1 according to the invention for inspecting<br>
the surface 9 in the interior of a hole 2 The device 1<br>
comprises a light source 3 with the aid of which a multicolor<br>
light beam 4 can be produced This light beam 4 passes<br>
unaffected through an optical separating filter 5 and is coupled<br>
into a light wave guide 6 to deflect the light beam 4 The light<br>
beam 4 is focused, with a lens system 7 using its chromatic<br>
aberration, onto a series of focal points and is deflected with<br>
a deflecting part 8 onto the surface 9 of the hole 2 The lens<br>
system 7 and the deflecting part 8 are coordinated with one<br>
another in such a manner that at least one of the focal points<br>
lies on the surface 9. Under certain circumstances a<br>
corresponding adaptation device, not represented here, must be<br>
provided so that this requirement can be met. The optical system<br>
comprising the lens system 7 and deflecting part 8 is mounted in<br>
such a manner that it can turn and can be moved along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the hole 2 These movements are preferably<br>
carried out via an electrical positioning device not represented<br>
here so that the surface 9 of the hole 2 can be scanned as<br>
completely and reproducibly as possible.<br>
On the surface 9 the light beam is reflected and conducted<br>
via the deflecting wedge 8 and the lens system 7 to the light<br>
wave guide 6 The optical separating filter separates the light<br>
beam 4 produced by the light source 3 from the reflected light<br>
beam 10 which is conducted to the sensor device 11 This sensor<br>
device is coupled to evaluation electronics, also not<br>
represented, which calculates from the spectrum of the reflected<br>
light beam 10 the distance between the device 1 according to the<br><br><br>
invention and the surface 9 and makes the data available for a<br>
later evaluation and/or visualization<br>
In FIG. 2 the use of a GRIN lens 12 with conventional<br>
optics 13 is represented in a schematic view. In the drawing an<br>
approximately 1.0 pitch GRIN lens 12 is represented, that is,<br>
the lens is dimensioned in such a manner that an incident light<br>
beam describes a period of a sinusoidal oscillation in the<br>
interior of the GRIN lens 12. To adjust the chromatic aberration<br>
the GRIN lens 12 is connected at the front to a positioning<br>
device 14, a so-called spacer.<br>
The light beam exiting from the GRIN lens 12 is conducted<br>
by optics 13, which is preferably formed by 1-1 imaging optics<br>
with two aspheric lenses, such imaging optics being known in<br>
aspheric telescopes Between the two lenses 15 and 16 a light<br>
wave guide not represented here can be disposed to bridge still<br>
greater distances The light beam exiting from this optics is<br>
conducted to the surface 9, under certain circumstances with the<br>
use of a deflecting device 8.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a development of the deflecting device 8 by a<br>
plane-parallel plate 17. The incident light beam 4 is refracted<br>
at each of the two boundary surface 18 and 19, whereby a<br>
shifted, parallel light beam 20 results. The shift v follows<br>
from the thickness d of the plate 17, the angle £ between the<br>
incident light beam 4 and the perpendicular to the plate 17, and<br>
the index of refraction n. If the plane-parallel plate 17 is<br>
rotated about the axis 21, then the shifted, parallel light beam<br>
20 describes a circular path on the surface to be examined If,<br>
in addition, the inclination of the plane-parallel plate 17 is<br>
varied, surfaces can be scanned in an annular pattern.<br>
Finally, let it be noted that the embodiment examples<br>
discussed above explain the claimed teaching but do not restrict<br>
it to the embodiment examples<br><br>
