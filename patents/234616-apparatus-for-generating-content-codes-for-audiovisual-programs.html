				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR ALLOWING A VIEWER TO ASSIGN<br>
CONTENT CODES TO SCENES IN AN AUDIOVISUAL<br>
PROGRAM AND A METHOD FOR GENERATING CONTENT<br>
CODES BY A VIEWER FOR THE SEQUENTIAL SCENES<br>
OF A PROGRAM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A. Feild of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the tagging of audiovisual content of a<br>
program, such as analog or digital motion pictures that are transmitted over<br>
cable, or video transmitted over the Internet More particularly, it pertains to a<br>
viewer-operated apparatus for tagging individual scenes of the audiovisual<br>
program so that it can later be replayed with selected scenes being omitted<br>
or replaced by others.<br>
B. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Presently, many video programs have ratings that can be used by<br>
viewers to determine whether they would like to play the programs, or whether<br>
they would allow others (such as children or adolescents) to play them.<br>
These types of ratings are also becoming available for TV shows, games, and<br>
other audiovisual programs. Programs broadcast over the Internet may be<br>
filtered or otherwise restricted using on-line filtering services, and set-top<br>
boxes and TVs with V-CHIP content filtering technology also exist for this<br>
purpose.<br>
As an improvement to current technology, it has been suggested that<br>
rating codes be provided for individual segments, or scenes, of programs.<br>
Automated playing devices would then be able to seamlessly eliminate<br>
segments with selected content, and/or substitute other segments with<br>
acceptable content if such segments are available. Commonly assigned co-<br>
pending application S.N. 09/479,819 filed January 7. 2000, entitled "Content<br>
Control of Broadcast Programs" and incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses a personal video recorder that receives and stores a broadcast<br>
program with each scene being tagged with a content rating. Parameters for<br>
acceptability of content are designated by viewers, and the appropriate<br>
scenes are played as a seamless continuous program. U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,987,21 land 6,208,805 to Abecassis discloses an apparatus which records a<br>
program on a disk and filters content according to viewer preferences. A<br>
viewer is shown only the segments having acceptable content. A parent has<br>
the ability to review a program and tag unacceptable scenes. The apparatus<br>
then omits the unacceptable scenes when the program is played.<br>
A major disadvantage of all of these systems is that, whether a<br>
universal rating is assigned to a whole program, or ratings are assigned to<br>
each of a program's individual scenes, the ratings still reflect a limited number<br>
of categories accepted by the public at large, industry-wide guidelines or the<br>
opinions of an editor. Thus, they fail to reflect inherent differences in the<br>
filtering categories of individual viewers due to many factors such as<br>
geographic location, level of education, income, religious and moral beliefs,<br>
etc., factors that meaningfully affect a person's views and preferences for<br>
what kind of programs and content they, or their children, should view.<br>
OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is believed to be beneficial to allow viewers to tag program scenes in<br>
keeping with their own preferences. Many programs, e.g. many TV shows<br>
and unrated movies, lack any form of scene tagging, and in other instances<br>
adults may desire to personally oversee audiovisual programs viewed by their<br>
children.<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an<br>
apparatus that permits viewing of scenes of a program, and the tagging of<br>
each scene with a content code that can be used later for filtering purposes.<br>
A further objective is to provide an apparatus that is viewer-friendly and<br>
easy to operate, an apparatus capable of being operated at home by an<br>
ordinary consumer.<br>
Yet another objective is to provide an apparatus that can provide types<br>
of content tags other than conventional ratings.<br>
Yet another objective is to provide an apparatus that can be easily<br>
adapted to accept content tags for each scene.<br>
A further objective is to provide an apparatus in which a program's<br>
scenes can be designated by the program provider, automatically detected, or<br>
designated by a viewer.<br>
scene and the content code for the scene. The identification may be<br>
generated by a timer that times the duration of each scene as well as previous<br>
scenes and then generates a starting and ending time for the scene. The<br>
apparatus also includes a memory for storing the codes for all the scenes<br>
including the assigned content codes and scene identifications.<br>
The apparatus further includes a controller adapted to selectively<br>
activate the scene indicator and generally manage the generation and storage<br>
of the scene codes.<br>
In this manner, the apparatus described above provides a user with<br>
the ability to designate and assign content codes for the scenes of a program<br>
in accordance with his individual tastes or preferences.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an apparatus for assigning content<br>
codes to scenes in accordance with this invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow chart for the apparatus of Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a somewhat diagrammatic view of a selector panel on<br>
which a viewer can enter his preferences.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, an apparatus 10 constructed in accordance with the<br>
invention includes a device such as a program player 12 that is adapted to<br>
play an audiovisual program on an audiovisual monitoring system 14. The<br>
program could be recorded on a DVD disk, a VCR tape or other similar media,<br>
Briefly, a viewer displays a program on an audiovisual monitoring<br>
system. The apparatus for assigning content codes to the program's scenes<br>
constructed in accordance with this invention includes a scene detector<br>
identifying the individual scenes of a program. The scene detector, in one<br>
embodiment, detects scene changes by analyzing the characteristics of<br>
sequential frames using known techniques. In another embodiment, the<br>
program itself includes codes that identify its scenes. In a third embodiment,<br>
the scene detector responds to a scene selector that is viewer activated.<br>
Also included in this invention is a scene indicator, which may be in the<br>
form of a visual or audible signal, and which indicates the beginning of a new<br>
scene. The viewer is prompted by the scene indicator to enter a content code<br>
for the new scene, this content code being related to the audio and visual<br>
content of the scene. In one embodiment, once the content code is entered,<br>
the scene indicator is deactivated until the detection of the next scene. If the<br>
duration of the scene is known, a timer may be provided to indicate to the<br>
viewer the time left to the end of the scene. If no content code is entered by<br>
the viewer by the end of the scene, a default content code is automatically<br>
assigned for that scene. The default may be the code for the immediately<br>
preceding scene. In another embodiment, the scene indicator is activated<br>
only for a brief duration (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to indicate the beginning of each<br>
scene (and, implicitly, the end of the previous scene).<br>
A code selector is also included in the apparatus. This code selector is<br>
adapted to receive the content code for a scene and to enter into a file a two-<br>
component code (two record fields) for the scene: an identification of the<br>
or in a personal video recorder receiving the program from a program source<br>
16, e.g. through a cable, XOSL, or satellite connection.<br>
Associated with the player 12 are a scene detector 18 and a program<br>
timer 20. The scene detector 18 is used to detect sceoef'in the program<br>
signal generated by player 12. The program timer 20 generates a count that<br>
can be used to provide unique identifications for the scenes of the program.<br>
Instead of the timer, other scene identification means may be used, such as a<br>
frame counter.<br>
A controller 22 directs the operation of the apparatus 10. The controller<br>
22 is coupled to the scene detector 18 and timer 20, and it is also associated<br>
with a code selector 24, a scene indicator 26, a scene timer 27, and a<br>
memory 28. It should be understood that all the elements in Fig. 1 can be<br>
implemented as a microprocessor-based device such as a PC, or can be<br>
incorporated into the program player 12 (especially if the player is a personal<br>
video recorder). However the apparatus 10 is shown in Fig. 1 as having<br>
discrete components for the sake of clarity.<br>
The apparatus of Fig. 1 operates as indicated by the flow chart of Fig.<br>
2. In step 100 the program player is activated to start playing a program on<br>
audiovisual monitoring system 14. The program timer 20 is activated as well.<br>
As the program is shown, the frames forming the program are<br>
monitored by scene detector 18 to detect the start of scenes that comprise<br>
the program. Scene detectors of this kind are well known in the art. When<br>
the first scene is detected (step 102), the controller 22 logs its starting time as<br>
indicated by program timer 20 (step 104).<br>
Next, the scene indicator 26 is activated (step 106). The scene<br>
indicator 26 may be a simple light that is turned on or a beeper that is<br>
activated. The scene indicator 26 is activated to prompt the viewer for a<br>
content code, using the code selector 24. The code selector 24, shown in<br>
more detail in Fig. 3, consists of a housing 30 which supports a plurality of<br>
switches 32, 34, 36 and 38. Each of the switches may be labeled with a<br>
content code, for example G, PG, R or X (More precise content codes may<br>
be used, giving rise to more than just four switches). For example, the<br>
content codes may indicate that a scene includes profanity, violence, sex,<br>
nudity, etc. Alternatively, the content codes may be selected using various<br>
other criteria. For example, if the program is a documentary about nature, the<br>
content code may be used to designate all scenes showing animals. Each of<br>
the switches 32-38 may be a momentary pushbutton switch. The scene<br>
indicator 26 may be positioned on the housing 30 as well.<br>
In some instances, the scene detector 18 may be too sensitive for the<br>
purposes of the present invention. More particularly, the scene detector may<br>
designate every camera angle change as a new scene. Therefore it may be<br>
advisable to have a viewer determine the start and end time of each scene.<br>
For this purpose, the code selector 24 may include a manual scene selector<br>
40. For example, the manual scene selector 40 may be a momentary<br>
pushbutton like switches 32-38. When this manual scene selector 40 is<br>
provided, the scene detector 18 can be turned off or omitted.<br>
In such an embodiment, after the program starts a viewer selects the<br>
start time of a scene by activating the manual scene selector 40. When the<br>
manual scene selector 40 is activated, the scene indicator 26 is also<br>
activated, thereby indicating that the current scene has not yet been assigned<br>
a content code. The start time is also logged, as in the embodiment of Fig. 2.<br>
When the viewer selects a content code, the indicator 26 goes off and stays<br>
off until the next scene is identified by the viewer operating button 40. In an<br>
alternate embodiment of the invention, the scene indicator 26 is activated only<br>
for a brief time, (e.g., three to ten seconds) duration to alert the viewer of the<br>
beginning of a scene (and the end of the previous scene). In this<br>
embodiment, the scene indicator 26 is deactivated independently of the<br>
selection of a content code by the viewer.<br>
As discussed above, as each scene is displayed on audiovisual<br>
monitoring system 14 with audio heard through associated speakers (not<br>
shown), the scene indicator 26 is activated. As the viewer views and listens<br>
to the current scene he makes a determination of what its content code<br>
should be. He then designates the content code for the scene by activating<br>
the appropriate switch 32-38. (It is possible to activate multiple switches if the<br>
system accommodates multiple content codes for a scene.)<br>
Returning to Fig. 2, in step 108 the controller 22 checks if the viewer<br>
has yet selected a content code. If a content code has been selected, then in<br>
step 110 the content code is logged together with a corresponding scene<br>
identification, e.g., its starting time code. In step 112 the controller 22<br>
deactivates the scene indicator 26. (If the scene indicator 26 is a beeper, it<br>
may emit a different sound than when it was activated in step 106).<br>
In step 114 the controller 22 checks the scene detector 18 for a new<br>
scene. When a new scene is detected, the controller 22 logs the end (e.g.,<br>
another time code) of the last scene (step 116).<br>
Next, In step 118 scene indicia, including the appropriate content<br>
code(s) and the corresponding scene identification data, are stored in scene<br>
content code memory 28.<br>
In step 120 a test is performed to determine if the end of the program<br>
has been reached. If the program end has not been reached, then the start<br>
time of the new scene is logged in step 104 and the new scene is processed<br>
as discussed above.<br>
In step 120 if the program end is detected, then in step 122 all the<br>
scene indicia are recorded in a specific file that may be left in memory 28,<br>
stored on the medium which itself contains the program, or somewhere else.<br>
Back at step 108, if a content code has not been selected yet for the<br>
current scene, then in step 124 the controller 22 checks the scene detector 18<br>
for a new scene. If a new scene is not detected, then the system 22 goes<br>
back to step 108. If a new scene is detected in step 124, then in step 126 a<br>
default content code is assigned to the scene. For example, the default code<br>
may be the code assigned to the previous scene.<br>
In step 128 the end of the scene being processed is logged and the<br>
process continues with step 118.<br>
The apparatus 10 can be modified for other types of operation as well.<br>
In one embodiment the scenes may be already defined by a specific code<br>
embedded within the program itself. In this case, instead of a scene detector,<br>
a decoder detects the beginning and end of each scene. This alternative is<br>
indicated in Fig. 1 for element 18.<br>
If the beginning and end points of each scene (and therefore its<br>
duration) are known, then, at the beginning of each scene, a scene timer 27<br>
may also be activated. This scene timer 27 can be configured to count down<br>
and indicate to a viewer how much time is left to the end of the scene (i.e., the<br>
time left before the viewer has to select a code).<br>
Instead of using an automatic or even manually operated scene<br>
detector, it is possible simply to allow the viewer to enter content codes at any<br>
time. Such changes in content codes would in effect signal a new scene.<br>
The advantage of identifying the start of a scene, however, is that the entered<br>
content codes are retroactive to the start of the scene. On replay, an<br>
appropriate player could curtail viewing of an objectionable scene from its<br>
start, not just from when the content codes were entered.<br>
By generating a content code for each scene of a program, a table is<br>
created which associates each scene with its content code and the address of<br>
the next scene. This table may be stored separately or may be attached to<br>
the program itself. The table can be used to control the manner in which the<br>
program is played. For example, co-pending commonly assigned U.S.<br>
application S.N. 09/479,819 filed January 7, 2000, entitled CONTENT<br>
CONTROL OF BROADCAST PROGRAMS and incorporated herein by<br>
reference discloses a method and apparatus wherein a program is broadcast<br>
together with its table to a customer with an appropriately configured personal<br>
video recorder. The customer selects an acceptable content code. The<br>
personal video recorder then can record and play only the scenes that have a<br>
predetermined content code, while skipping the scenes with other codes.<br>
Since the table with the content codes is received in advance, the personal<br>
recorder can determine the scenes that are to be skipped, and the duration of<br>
these skipped scenes. The recorder therefore can delay playing the program<br>
by the duration of the skipped scenes so that the program can be played<br>
without interruption.<br>
Another advantage of providing a program with a table of scene-<br>
associated content codes is that it allows a content provider to create a<br>
program with several interchangeable scenes, each scene having a unique<br>
content code. A customer may then elect to get a program with all the<br>
scenes. Alternatively, a customer may elect to a version of the program with<br>
all the scenes having a predetermined content code or codes.<br>
Obviously, numerous other modifications can be made to this invention<br>
without departing from its scope, as defined in the appended claims.<br>
