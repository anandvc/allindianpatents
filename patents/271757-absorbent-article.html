				<td>ABSORBENT ARTICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an absorbent article<br>
that is provided with marks indicating ideal attachment<br>
positions and thereby ensures stable attachment. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to an absorbent article used<br>
along with an undergarment, such as sanitary napkins and<br>
urine-absorbing pads.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
When attaching an absorbent article such as a sanitary<br>
napkin, in general, a user attaches it while visually<br>
ascertaining the positional relationship between a crotch part<br>
of shorts and the sanitary napkin. As used herein, the<br>
undergarment to which the sanitary napkin is attached has the<br>
crotch part that is narrow and curved to the inside in the<br>
vicinity of the crotch. In the sanitary napkin, the rear side,<br>
the area corresponding to the crotch part, is shaped so as to<br>
increase its width toward the outside in order to cover the<br>
hip. The user therefore sets the sanitary napkin, placing the<br>
transverse mid-portion of the napkin on the longitudinal<br>
centerline of the crotch part. For the sanitary napkin with<br>
side flaps, the user further sets the mid-portion of the side<br>
flaps in the longitudinal direction of the sanitary napkin at<br>
a minimum width portion of the crotch part. The user then<br>
folds back and fixes the side flaps against the external<br><br>
surface of the crotch part. Thus, the attachment is completed<br>
through the foregoing operations.<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a sanitary napkin in which,<br>
in order to attach the sanitary napkin to an ideal position, a<br>
mark is provided at the mid-portion of the sanitary napkin and<br>
the mark is directly applied to the private parts, ensuring<br>
ideal attachment. Nevertheless, the sanitary napkin disclosed<br>
in Patent Document 1 requires that a wearer must pull up the<br>
undergarment while supporting the sanitary napkin by herself.<br>
This might cause dislocation in the attachment of the sanitary<br>
napkin when pulling up the undergarment. Moreover, when<br>
attaching the sanitary napkin, the wearer must directly touch<br>
at the sanitary napkin, and therefore the wearer's hands might<br>
be soiled with menstrual blood and body fluid.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. Hei 11-76304<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
In the sanitary napkin disclosed in Patent Document 1,<br>
neither the transverse mid-portion of the napkin nor the mid-<br>
portion of side flaps in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
napkin is provided with a distinct one serving as a mark.<br>
Since the sanitary napkin has no mark for positioning, the<br>
user needs much time for positioning at the time of attachment.<br>
It is probable that the attachment position is dislocated back,<br>
forth, right, and left. If the attachment position is<br><br>
dislocated, it is impossible to have an absorber sufficiently<br>
absorb menstrual blood and body fluid. In some cases, the<br>
undergarment and the wearer's skin may be soiled. This may<br>
also exert uncomfortable feeling on the wearer during the<br>
attachment.<br>
In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide an absorbent article that is<br>
provided with marks indicating ideal attachment positions,<br>
ensuring stable attachment.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventor has had intensive investigation in<br>
order to solve the above problems, and has achieved the<br>
present invention based on the discovery that the above<br>
problems can be solved by an absorbent article having at least<br>
one pair of first marks pair indicating a central position in<br>
a transverse direction of an absorbent article body, and<br>
second marks pair indicating a central position of side flaps<br>
in a longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides the<br>
following absorbent articles.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, an<br>
absorbent article includes an absorbent article body having a<br>
longitudinal direction and a transverse direction; and a pair<br>
of side flaps that project outward from both side parts in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body,<br>
respectively, and are folded back and fixed against the<br>
external surface of a crotch part of an undergarment at the<br><br>
time of attachment. The absorbent article body has a liquid<br>
permeable top sheet disposed on the side of a wearer's skin, a<br>
liquid impermeable back sheet disposed on the side of the<br>
undergarment, an absorber that is interposed between the top<br>
sheet and the back sheet, and that absorbs and retains body<br>
fluid. The side flaps have at least one of the top sheet, the<br>
back sheet, and side sheets, and has at least one pair of<br>
first marks pair indicating a central position in the<br>
transverse direction of the absorbent article body, and second<br>
marks pair indicating a central position of the side flaps in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body.<br>
The absorbent article has the side flaps for fixing the<br>
absorbent article body to the undergarment, and has at least<br>
one pair of the first marks pair indicating the central<br>
position in the transverse direction of the absorbent article<br>
body, and the second marks pair indicating the central<br>
position of the side flaps in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the absorbent article body. The first marks pair is used for<br>
positioning with the longitudinal centerline of the crotch<br>
part of the undergarment, and the second marks pair is used<br>
for positioning with the minimum width portion of the crotch<br>
part of the undergarment. These marks enable the user to<br>
easily recognize at a glance the positional relationship<br>
between the undergarment and the absorbent article when fixing<br>
the absorbent article to the undergarment. Hence, in the<br>
absorbent article, the attachment position is hardly<br>
dislocated back, forth, right, and left, ensuring stable<br><br>
attachment. This enables to suppress dislocations in the<br>
attachment position of the absorbent article. It is therefore<br>
rare for the menstrual blood and body fluid leaked from the<br>
dislocated absorbent article to soil the skin. It is also rare<br>
for the dislocated absorbent article to exert uncomfortable<br>
feeling on the wearer. Specific examples of the absorbent<br>
article are urine-absorbing pads as well as sanitary napkins.<br>
In a second aspect of the absorbent article as described<br>
in the first aspect of the present invention, the absorbent<br>
article body and the side flaps have a seal part formed at a<br>
circumferential edge of sheets constituting the absorbent<br>
article body and the side flaps, and the first marks pair and<br>
the second marks pair are marks formed by the seal part.<br>
This absorbent article is provided with the seal part<br>
formed at the circumferential edge of the sheets constituting<br>
the absorbent article body and the side flaps. The first marks<br>
pair and the second marks pair can be formed by imparting a<br>
characteristic shape to the seal part formed at the<br>
circumferential edge of the sheet. That is, the seal used for<br>
connecting the sheets is employed to form the first marks pair<br>
and the second marks pair. It is therefore unnecessary to<br>
install a new manufacturing unit and use a new special<br>
material in the manufacturing steps. Hence, the additional<br>
cost occasioned by the incorporation of the marks is avoidable.<br>
In a third aspect of the absorbent article as described<br>
in the first or second aspect of the present invention, the<br>
side flaps have, on the side of the back sheet, an adhesion<br><br>
part that fixes the side flaps folded back against the<br>
external surface of the crotch part of the undergarment at the<br>
time of attachment, and the adhesion part is disposed so as<br>
not to overlap with the seal part.<br>
In this absorbent article, the adhesion part, which fixes<br>
the side flaps folded back against the external surface of the<br>
crotch part of the undergarment at the time of attachment, is<br>
provided on the side of the back sheet of the side flaps.<br>
Usually, the adhesion part can be formed by the application of<br>
hot melt adhesive (HMA) . The seal part can be formed with a<br>
connecting device provided with a pattern roll having a<br>
pressing part with projections, and a pattern roll with a<br>
smooth surface. Consequently, if the adhesion part is<br>
overlapped with the seal part, the HMA may be separated from<br>
the side flaps when stripping the side flaps from the<br>
undergarment, and then the HMA may remain in the undergarment.<br>
However, the absorbent article in accordance with the third<br>
aspect is capable of avoiding this drawback. In cases where<br>
the user attaches an absorbent article with side flaps, the<br>
user usually pinches the mid-portion of the side flaps by the<br>
fingers, and with the side flaps spread, folds back them<br>
against the external surface of the crotch part of the<br>
undergarment, and then presses the side flaps by the fingers.<br>
Therefore, if the adhesive part is continuously provided in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body, when<br>
pinching the mid-portion of the flaps, the HMA may stick to<br>
the fingers, and the adhesion may be lowered. However, the<br><br>
absorbent article in accordance with the third aspect is also<br>
capable of solving this drawback.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the absorbent article as described<br>
in the first aspect of the present invention, at least one<br>
pair of the first marks pair and the second marks pair are<br>
marks formed by printing.<br>
In this absorbent article, at least one of the first<br>
marks pair and the second marks pair are printed. No<br>
particular limitations are imposed on the printing method and<br>
the mark shape. This absorbent article is capable of producing<br>
with a relatively simple technique the same effect as the<br>
absorbent article in accordance with the first aspect.<br>
In a fifth aspect of the absorbent article as described<br>
in the first aspect of the present invention, at least one<br>
pair of the first marks pair and the second marks pair are<br>
formed with adhesive paper.<br>
In this absorbent article, at least one pair of the first<br>
marks pair and the second marks pair are formed by adhesive<br>
paper. The adhesive paper itself can be used as a mark.<br>
Alternatively, a marked paper may be used as a mark. Sticking<br>
the paper that can serve as a mark achieves the same effects<br>
as the absorbent article in accordance with the first aspect.<br>
In a sixth aspect of the absorbent article as described<br>
in the first aspect of the present invention, there are<br>
further provided a pair of solid gathers that are disposed on<br>
both sides in a longitudinal direction of the top sheet so as<br>
to extend along the longitudinal direction, and stand on the<br><br>
side of a wearer's skin during attachment. Each of the solid<br>
gathers has a resilient member extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and a liquid impermeable gather sheet that is<br>
connected integrally with the resilient member, one side end<br>
of the gather sheet being a free end. The second marks are<br>
marks constructed of a side seal part formed by connecting the<br>
other side end of the gather sheet to the top sheet.<br>
This absorbent article has the pair of solid gathers that<br>
are disposed on both sides in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the top sheet so as to extend along the longitudinal direction,<br>
and stand on the side of the wearer's skin during attachment.<br>
A characteristic shape is imparted to the side seal part that<br>
connects the solid gather and the top sheet, and the<br>
characteristic shape can serve as the second marks. Usually,<br>
when attaching an absorbent article with side flaps, the side<br>
flaps are folded back and fixed against the external surface<br>
of the crotch part of the undergarment. After they are fixed,<br>
the user cannot visually observe the side flaps. Therefore,<br>
even if any mark is provided on the side flaps, it is<br>
difficult for the user to ascertain any dislocation in the<br>
attachment position after the operation of sticking the side<br>
flaps to the undergarment is completed. On the other hand, in<br>
the absorbent article in accordance with the sixth aspect, the<br>
absorbent article body has the second marks, instead of<br>
providing marks on the side flaps. This enables the user to<br>
ascertain whether the attachment position is dislocated or not<br>
by the aid of the second marks even after the operation of<br><br>
sticking the side flaps to the undergarment.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
Thus, the present invention can provide the absorbent<br>
article that has the marks indicating an ideal attachment<br>
position and thereby ensures stable attachment.<br>

PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the preferred embodiments except for a first preferred<br>
embodiment, the construction and the operative effects<br>
identical to those of the first preferred embodiment will be<br>
left out in the following description.<br>
First Preferred Embodiment<br>
[Overall Construction]<br>
Figure 1 is a plan view when an absorbent article 10<br>
according to the first preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, namely from the side of a top sheet.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the absorbent article 10 has an absorbent<br>
article body 11 having a longitudinal direction and a<br>
transverse direction, and a pair of side flaps 12. The pair of<br>
side flaps 12 project from both side parts in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the absorbent article body 11, respectively, and<br>
are folded back and fixed against the external surface of a<br>
crotch part of the undergarment at the time of attachment. A<br>
seal part 13 is provided at the circumferences of the<br>
absorbent article body 11 and the side flaps 12. The seal part<br>
13 in the transverse direction of the absorbent article body<br>
11 has a pair of first marks 14, and the seal part 13 in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body 11 has a<br>
pair of second marks 15.<br>
[Absorbent Article Body 11]<br>
The absorbent article body 11 has a liquid permeable top<br><br>
sheet that is disposed on the side of a wearer's skin, a<br>
liquid impermeable back sheet that is disposed on the side of<br>
the undergarment, and an absorber that is interposed between<br>
the top sheet and the back sheet, and that absorbs and retains<br>
body fluid. Alternatively, the absorbent article body 11 may<br>
have a liquid impermeable leakage-proof sheet between the<br>
absorber and the back sheet. In this case, the top sheet and<br>
the back sheet are connected to each other, and the leakage-<br>
proof sheet is also connected to the top sheet and the back<br>
sheet.<br>
[Top Sheet]<br>
As a sheet member constituting the top sheet, in general,<br>
a liquid hydrophilic member having liquid permeability can be<br>
used. Preferably, the sheet member is a member of rich<br>
flexibility and superior feeling because it is brought into<br>
contact with the user's skin. For example, there are liquid<br>
permeable nonwoven fabric constructed of polypropylene and<br>
polyethylene, artificial fibers such as film, porous plastic<br>
film and porous foam, and natural fibers such as cotton. As<br>
the sheet member, the exemplified members may be used<br>
singularly or in combination of these.<br>
[Back Sheet]<br>
As a sheet member constituting the back sheet, there can<br>
be used a liquid impermeable resin film and a nonwoven fabric<br>
that are constructed of one of or in combination of<br>
polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate. Preferably, the sheet member<br><br>
constituting the back sheet is a nonwoven fabric with resin<br>
films laminated thereon, a laminate member of resin and paper,<br>
and a member to which liquid permeability is imparted by<br>
adding filler or the like to a resin film, followed by drawing.<br>
[Absorber]<br>
Although no particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
absorber, for example, such a member that pulverized pulp<br>
(e.g., wood pulp) is covered with a wrap member (tissue) may<br>
be used. Examples of the sheet member are air laid pulp, span<br>
lace nonwoven fabric and melt blown nonwoven fabric each using<br>
hydrophilic fiber, water absorptive paper, and members in<br>
combination of these, as well as starch polymer, acrylic acid<br>
polymer, and celluloses. No particular limitation is imposed<br>
on the shape of the material of the absorber. For example, the<br>
absorber may have the shape of granule, sheet, or fiber. No<br>
particular limitation is also imposed on the shape of the<br>
absorber itself.<br>
[Side Flaps 12]<br>
The side flaps 12 have at least one of the top sheet,<br>
back sheet, and the side sheets. The sheet member constituting<br>
the side sheets may be a liquid permeable sheet or a liquid<br>
impermeable sheet. The side sheets may be arranged so as to<br>
project outward from between the top sheet and the back sheet,<br>
respectively, in the both side parts in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the absorbent article body 11, or may be arranged<br>
so as to project outward from the upper part of the top sheet,<br>
respectively. Alternatively, the side sheets may be arranged<br><br>
so as to project outward from the lower part of the back sheet.<br>
In a still other alternative, the top sheet itself<br>
constituting the absorbent article body 11 may be arranged so<br>
as to project outward from the both side parts in the<br>
longitudinal direction, respectively.<br>
In the first preferred embodiment, the second marks<br>
indicate the central positions of the side flaps 12 in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body 11, and<br>
are disposed at the seal part 13 in the circumferences of the<br>
right and left side flaps 12. Usually, in the side flaps 12,<br>
adhesion parts are disposed on the side of the back sheet (not<br>
shown). The adhesion parts are provided for fixing the side<br>
flaps 12 folded back against the external surface of the<br>
crotch part of the undergarment at the time of attachment (not<br>
shown).<br>
[Seal Part 13]<br>
A connecting device provided with a pattern roll having a<br>
pressing part with projections and a pattern roll with a<br>
smooth surface is used to form the seal part 13. The<br>
connecting device forms the seal part 13 by connecting the<br>
circumferences of the top sheet and that of the back sheet<br>
with each other. In order to improve the touch of the seal<br>
part 13, it is usually preferable that the connection is<br>
carried out by pressing the pattern roll having the pressing<br>
part with projections from the side of the top sheet, and<br>
pressing the pattern roll with the smooth surface from the<br>
side of the back sheet. The same connecting device is used to<br><br>
seal the leakage-proof sheet, the top sheet, and the back<br>
sheet.<br>
[Pair of First Marks 14 and Pair of Second Marks 15]<br>
The pair of first marks 14 are marks indicating the<br>
central positions in the transverse direction of the absorbent<br>
article body 11. The pair of second marks 15 are marks<br>
indicating the central positions of the side flaps 12 in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body 11. As<br>
shown in Fig. 1, the pair of first marks 14 and the pair of<br>
second marks 15 are of the same shape, and the shape of<br>
arbitrary marks can be obtained by slitting the seal part 13.<br>
These marks are not necessarily required to have the same<br>
shape as in this preferred embodiment, and they may have<br>
different shapes. Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the pair of<br>
first marks 14. As shown in Fig. 2, the pair of first marks 14<br>
are marks obtained by forming a deep slit that reaches the end,<br>
and the pair of second marks 15 have the same shape (not<br>
shown). Both of the pair of first marks 14 and the pair of<br>
second marks 15 can be formed by imparting a slit shape to the<br>
pattern rolls used for forming the seal part 13. Specifically,<br>
to form the pair of first marks 14 and the pair of second<br>
marks 15, slits are provided respectively at the mid-portion<br>
of both edges in the longitudinal direction of the absorbent<br>
article body 11, and at the portions corresponding to the mid-<br>
portions of the side edges of the side flaps 12 in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the absorbent article body 11, on<br>
the side of the pattern roll having the pressing part with<br><br>
projections. Then, sealing is performed with the connecting<br>
device, thereby forming the pair of first marks 14 and the<br>
pair of second marks 15.<br>
[Operative Effects]<br>
The pair of first marks 14 indicates the central<br>
positions in the transverse direction of the absorbent article<br>
body 11, and used to perform positioning with the centerline<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the crotch part of the<br>
undergarment. The pair of second marks 15 indicates the<br>
central positions of the side flaps 12 in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the absorbent article body 11, and used to<br>
perform positioning with the minimum width part of the crotch<br>
part of the undergarment. These marks enable the user to<br>
easily recognize at a glance the positional relationship<br>
between the undergarment and the absorbent article 10 when<br>
fixing the absorbent article 10 to the undergarment. Thus, the<br>
attachment position of the absorbent article 10 is hardly<br>
dislocated back, forth, right, and left, enabling the user to<br>
ensure stable attachment.<br>
Second Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 3 is a plan view when an absorbent article 20<br>
according to a second preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorbent article 20 is<br>
different from the absorbent article 10 of the first preferred<br>
embodiment in the shape of the pair of first marks 14 and the<br>
pair of second marks 15. Otherwise, the construction is<br><br>
identical to that described in the first preferred embodiment.<br>
Specifically, the pair of first marks 14 and the pair of<br>
second marks 15 of the first preferred embodiment are shaped<br>
like a deep slit extending to the end, whereas those of the<br>
second preferred embodiment are shaped like a shallow slit,<br>
instead of the deep slit extending to the end. Figure 4 is an<br>
enlarged view of first marks 24. Referring to Fig. 4, unlike<br>
the first preferred embodiment, in the absorbent article 20 of<br>
the second preferred embodiment, any unsealed portion is not<br>
present at the ends of the respective marks, and the ends of<br>
the marks are firmly sealed. This avoids the fear that the<br>
sheets are stripped from each other from an unsealed point.<br>
Third Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 5 is a plan view when an absorbent article 30<br>
according to a third preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 5, like the second preferred<br>
embodiment, the absorbent article 30 of the third preferred<br>
embodiment is different from the absorbent article 10 of the<br>
first preferred embodiment in the shape of the pair of first<br>
marks 14 and the pair of second marks 15. Otherwise, the<br>
construction is identical to that described in the first<br>
preferred embodiment. Specifically, first marks 34 and second<br>
marks 35 of the absorbent article 30 of the third preferred<br>
embodiment are shaped so as to project at an acute angle<br>
inwardly of an absorbent article body 31. Compared to the<br>
first and second preferred embodiments in which the slits are<br><br>
provided in the seal part as marks, the seal strength can be<br>
further enhanced, enabling to further avoid the fear of<br>
stripping between the sheets.<br>
Fourth Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 6 is a plan view when an absorbent article 40<br>
according to a fourth preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 6, the absorbent article 40 is<br>
different from the first preferred embodiment in the shape of<br>
the absorbent article body, the region where the seal part is<br>
disposed, and the shape of the marks. Otherwise, the<br>
construction is identical to that described in the first<br>
preferred embodiment. Specifically, the locations of side<br>
flaps 42 are shifted to the front side of an absorbent article<br>
body 41 (the term "the front side" as used herein means the<br>
side to be set at the front of the undergarment during<br>
attachment). Both side parts in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the rear side of the absorbent article body 41 (the term "the<br>
rear side" as used herein means the side to be set at the rear<br>
of the undergarment during attachment) are swelled slightly<br>
outward, resulting in a wider shape than the front side. A<br>
seal part 43 is not disposed throughout the circumference of<br>
the absorbent article 40. That is, the seal part 43 is<br>
disposed at the circumference at both ends in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the absorbent article body 41, at part of both<br>
side parts in the longitudinal direction on the rear side, and<br>
at the circumferences of the side flaps 42. First marks pair<br><br>
44 and second marks pair 45 are formed by allowing the seal<br>
part 43 to project in the shape of a band inwardly of the<br>
absorbent article body 41. Thus, in the absorbent article 40<br>
of the fourth preferred embodiment, the seal part 43 is<br>
disposed at a minimum required area to a degree that the<br>
stripping between the sheets does not occur. The fourth<br>
preferred embodiment produces the same effects as the first<br>
preferred embodiment.<br>
Modification 1<br>
Figure 7 is a plan view when an absorbent article 50<br>
according to a modification 1 of the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment is viewed from the side of a wearer's skin, that is,<br>
from the side of the top sheet. As shown in Fig. 7, in the<br>
absorbent article 50 of this modification, the above-mentioned<br>
side flaps 42 of the absorbent article 40 are provided with<br>
adhesion parts 56 for fixing the side flaps 42 folded back<br>
against the external surface of the crotch part of the<br>
undergarment at the time of attachment. Specifically, a<br>
plurality of the adhesion parts 56 are located at a<br>
predetermined spacing so as not to overlap with a seal part 53.<br>
Usually, hot melt adhesive (HMA) is applied as the adhesion<br>
parts 56.<br>
This modification produces the following operative<br>
effects. That is, a seal part usually has irregularities, and<br>
therefore if the adhesive part is overlapped with the seal<br>
part, the HMA may be separated from the side flaps when<br>
stripping the side flaps from the undergarment. There may<br><br>
arise the drawback that the separated HMA remains in the<br>
undergarment. However, this drawback can be solved by this<br>
modification. Especially, like this modification, when the<br>
seal part 53 projects to the inside of the absorbent article<br>
body 51, as the mark of the corresponding locations, it is<br>
effective to provide the plurality of adhesive parts at a<br>
predetermined spacing. Additionally, when attaching an<br>
absorbent article with side flaps, the user usually pinches<br>
the mid-portion of the side flaps by the fingers, and with the<br>
side flaps spread, folds back them against the external<br>
surface of the crotch part of the undergarment, and then<br>
presses the side flaps by the fingers. Therefore, if the<br>
adhesive part is continuously provided in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the absorbent article body, when pinching the<br>
mid-portion of the flaps, the HMA may stick to the fingers,<br>
and the adhesion may be lowered. However, this modification is<br>
also capable of solving this drawback.<br>
Modification 2<br>
Figure 8 is a plan view when an absorbent article 60<br>
according to a modification 2 of the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment is viewed from the side of a wearer's skin, that is,<br>
from the side of the top sheet. As shown in Fig. 8, adhesive<br>
parts 66 are provided continuously so as to detour second<br>
marks 65, whereas in the modification 1, the plurality of<br>
adhesion parts 56 of the absorbent article 50 are located at<br>
the spacing. Because the adhesive part 66 is provided<br>
continuously, the modification 2 exhibits the enhanced<br><br>
adhesive and also produces the same effects as the<br>
modification 1.<br>
Fifth Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 9 is a plan view when an absorbent article 70<br>
according to a fifth preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 9, the absorbent article 70 has<br>
printed second marks pair 75, instead of the pair of second<br>
marks 45 of the absorbent article 40 in the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment. In the fifth preferred embodiment, pair first<br>
marks 74 are formed by allowing a seal part 73 to project to<br>
the inside of an absorbent article body 71. Alternatively, the<br>
pair of first marks 74 may also be printed like the pair of<br>
second marks 75. In the fifth preferred embodiment, the pair<br>
of second marks 75 are in the shape of an arrow. No particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the shape of the marks so long as<br>
they can serve as the marks. No particular limitation is<br>
imposed on the printing method. Examples of the printing<br>
method are conventionally well-known ink printing and braille<br>
printing using emboss. The printed second marks are required<br>
to be visually observable from the side sheet side. In order<br>
to avoid sticking to the skin, it is therefore preferable that,<br>
in place of the top side of the side sheets (the wearer's skin<br>
side), the back side of the side sheets (the undergarment<br>
side) or the top side of the back sheet is subjected to<br>
printing, enabling the printed marks to be visible from the<br>
side sheets side. The absorbent article 70 so constructed in<br><br>
accordance with the fifth preferred embodiment is also capable<br>
of producing the same effects as the first preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
Sixth Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 10 is a plan view when an absorbent article 80<br>
according to a sixth preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 10, the absorbent article 80 has<br>
second marks pair 85 that can be formed by sticking papers<br>
each provided with a mark, to the side sheets, in place of the<br>
pair of second marks45 of the absorbent article 40 in the<br>
fourth preferred embodiment. Specifically, the pair of second<br>
marks 85 are required to be visually observable from the side<br>
sheets side. In order to avoid sticking to the skin, it is<br>
therefore preferable that, instead of direct sticking to the<br>
side sheets side (the wearer's skin side), sealing is carried<br>
out after inserting papers each having a mark into between the<br>
side sheets and the back sheet, enabling the marks to be<br>
visually observable from the side sheets side. No particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the shape of the marks. The absorbent<br>
article 80 so constructed in accordance with the sixth<br>
preferred embodiment is also capable of producing the same<br>
effects as the first preferred embodiment.<br>
Seventh Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 11 is a plan view when an absorbent article 90<br>
according to a seventh preferred embodiment is viewed from the<br>
side of a wearer's skin, that is, from the side of the top<br><br>
sheet. As shown in Fig. 11, the absorbent article 90 has a<br>
pair of solid gathers disposed so as to extend along the<br>
longitudinal direction on both sides in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the top sheet (for the sake of simplicity, the<br>
solid gathers are not illustrated). Second marks pair 95 can<br>
be formed by side seal parts 97 that connect the solid gathers<br>
and the top sheet to each other.<br>
The solid gathers stand on the wearer's skin side during<br>
attachment in order to prevent leakage. Each of the solid<br>
gathers has a resilient member (not shown) disposed along the<br>
longitudinal direction of an absorbent article body 91, and a<br>
liquid impermeable gather sheet (not shown) that is integrally<br>
connected to the resilient member, one side end of the gather<br>
sheet being a free end. As the resilient member and the gather<br>
sheet, conventionally well-known members can be used. The pair<br>
of second marks 95 can be formed by the side seal parts 97<br>
that can be formed by connecting the other side end of the<br>
gather sheet to the top sheet. Like a seal part 93 disposed at<br>
the circumference of the absorbent article 90, the side seal<br>
parts 97 can be formed by using a pattern roll with a smooth<br>
surface and a pattern roll having a pressing part with<br>
projections. Although in the seventh preferred embodiment, the<br>
pair of second marks 95 are shaped so as to project outward at<br>
an acute angle, no particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
shape of the pair second marks 95 so long as they can serve as<br>
the marks. In the absorbent article provided with the solid<br>
gathers as in the seventh preferred embodiment, overlapping of<br><br>
the seal part with the ends of the solid gathers may cut the<br>
resilient member or inhibit the standing of the solid gathers.<br>
Hence, it is preferable that the seal part is not provided<br>
throughout the circumference of the absorbent article, namely,<br>
the seal part is provided in the area except for the positions<br>
overlapped with the solid gathers.<br>
In addition to the same effects as the first preferred<br>
embodiment, the absorbent article 90 of the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment produces the following effects. In a state in which<br>
the absorbent article with side flaps is attached, the side<br>
flaps are usually folded back and fixed against the external<br>
surface of the crotch part of the undergarment, making it<br>
impossible for the user to visually recognize the side flaps.<br>
Therefore, even if any mark is provided on the side flaps, it<br>
is difficult for the user to ascertain any dislocation in the<br>
attachment position after the operation of sticking the side<br>
flaps to the undergarment is completed. On the other hand, in<br>
the absorbent article of the seventh preferred embodiment, the<br>
pair of second marks 95 are provided on the absorbent article<br>
body 91, not on the side flaps 92. This enables the user to<br>
ascertain whether the attachment position is dislocated or not<br>
even after the operation of sticking to the undergarment.<br><br>
