Microcapsules with UV filter activity and process for producing them<br>
The present invention relates to novel UV filters on the basis of microcapsules, a process for the preparation and their use especially in formulations for the protection against harmful effects of sunlight.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in sunlight protected sites of the body. Among the damaging results of intensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosis, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sunscreening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effect of UV-A (320 to 400 nm) and/or UV-B (290-320 nm) wavelength and even shorter wavelength (UV-C). These chemicals are usually incorporated either alone or in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used.<br>
Most UV filters used in sunscreen compositions are monomeric compounds e, and thus there is the inherent risk that such compounds can penetrate the skin barrier, which is highly undesirable. UV filters on the basis of polysiloxanes which may be either linear or cyclic are described e.g. in WO 93/04665, WO 94/06404, EP-A 538 431, EP-A 392 883 and EP-A 358 584. With these polysiloxanes the risk of skin penetration is lower, but it is sometimes difficult to incorporate the polysiloxanes in sunscreen compositions due to incompatibility problems which differ depending on the UV-active chromophores which are covalently bonded to the polysiloxanes.<br>
A further problem with presently known UV filters is that they tend to interact, which in some cases in which a sunscreen composition contains more than one type of UV filter, leads to a situation where the UV filter activity of one or both of the UV filters is reduced during storage or after being applied to the skin. Attempts have been made to solve this problem by<br><br>
encapsulating one type of UV filter or two or more types of UV filter which are present in a sunscreen composition in order to minimize the contact of the UV filters during storage and when applied to the skin. Microcapsules are disclosed which release the UV filters over time, others are designed to permanently encapsulate the UV filter. Encapsulation technologies are described e.g. in FR 2 642 329, DE-A 195 37 415, EP-A 509 904, FR 2 726 760 and FR 2 687 914 as well as WO 00/71084, US-A 6,303,149, WO 98/31333, US-A 5,876,699 and WO 00/72806.<br>
Some of these microencapsulated UV filters are designed to release the UV filter from the microcapsules in a controlled manner in order to maintain a constant concentration of the UV filter in the sunscreen composition. Thus, the active UV filters in the sunscreen compositions are still highly movable monomeric compounds which have the inherent risk of penetrating the skin after application. Furthermore, in these embodiments there may still be inactivation of the UV filters, and in order to maintain a constant concentration in a sunscreen composition, the microcapsules need to have a high initial loading. Finally, it is difficult to ensure a controlled release of the UV filters from the microcapsules.<br>
In another embodiment microcapsules are designed which should permanently encapsulate the UV filters and those microcapsules are often prepared by a sol-gel process. However, it is difficult to prepare microcapsules which do not leak the UV filters, and in practice it has been shown that the interaction between the UV filters can be reduced by encapsulating them e.g. with a sol-gel process, but this only slows down the inactivation of the UV filters but does not sufficiently prevent it.<br>
WO 98/31333 discloses sunscreen doped sol-gel materials which are useful for protecting body tissue and other surfaces from sunlight radiation. The sol-gel materials are prepared by encapsulating UV filter chromophores by a sol-gel process. It is also disclosed that the monomers which are used for encapsulating the chromophores can be compounds of a general formula M(R)n(P)m, wherein M is a metallic or semi-metallic element, R is a hydrolysable substituent, n is an integer from 2 to 6, P is a non-polymerizable substituent or sunscreening moiety and m is an integer from 0 to 6. Thus, this document considers the possibility to use monomers for the formulation of the matrix of the microcapsules which in themselves have sunscreening activity (without disclosing any example of such a monomer). However, these monomers are still used to form a matrix which encapsulates monomeric chromophores which are not covalently bonded to the matrix material and in all<br><br>
processes for producing microcapsules disclosed in this document monomeric non-polymerizable chromophores are encapsulated by the sol-gel process. Thus, the microcapsules disclosed in WO 98/31333 all comprise encapsulated chromophores which are not chemically bonded to the matrix material, and it was obviously believed that it is not possible to provide microcapsules with sufficient sunscreen activity, if no chromophores are encapsulated within the microcapsules. Accordingly, the microcapsules disclosed in WO 98/31333 still show the problems discussed above.<br>
EP-A 1 205 178 and EP-A 1 205 177 suggest to reduce the risk of penetration of active ingredients such as UV filters into the skin and possible damage of the skin or allergies caused thereby by immobilizing the active ingredients or UV filters present in a dermatological or cosmetic composition. These documents disclose a conjugate which comprises an anorganic pigment and an active ingredient on the basis of an organic compound which is covalently bonded via a spacer group to the anorganic pigment. The conjugate disclosed in these documents thus contains an anorganic pigment and to the surface of this pigment chromophores are chemically bonded. With such a construction the problem of penetration of the active ingredient into the skin is solved, however, there is still the risk that the active ingredients interact with one another, which can lead to a deactivation of the UV filter activity in the lightscreening composition, because all chromophores are on the surface of the anorganic pigment.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of novel UV filters which do not show the shortcomings of the prior art as described above. The UV filters should have excellent UV filter activity, be easily accessible and compatible with the other usual ingredients of cosmetic and dermatological compositions.<br>
It was surprisingly found that a new type of UV filters which is in the form of microcapsules and obtainable by a process, wherein at least one type of crosslinkable monomer with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity and optionally at least one type of crosslinkable monomer which does not have UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity are subjected to a crosslinking reaction in the absence of non-crosslinkable chromophores with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity.<br>
Contrary to the belief in the prior art which is expressed e.g. in WO 98/31333, it was found that microcapsules which exclusively comprise chromophores with UV filter activity which<br><br>
are covalently bonded to the polymer matrix of the microcapsule have sufficient UV filter activity and that it is not necessary to dope these microcapsules with additional monomeric chromophores which are not covalently bonded to the polymeric matrix material but encapsulated in the microcapsules. Therefore, the microcapsules of the present invention do not comprise encapsulated monomeric chromophores with UV filter activity, but all chromophores which are present in the microcapsules of the present invention are covalently bonded to the polymer which forms the matrix material.<br>
The term "UV filter activity" as used herein encompasses UV-A, UV-B and UV-C filter activity, preferably UV-A and UV-B filter activity. If the term "UV filter" or "UV filter activity" is used without further explanation, it refers to compounds or compositions or moieties which have either UV-A or UV-B or UV-C filter activity as well as to compounds or compositions or moieties which have both UV-A and UV-B filter activity and to compounds or compositions or moieties which have UV-A, UV-B and UV-C filter activity and to compounds or compositions or moieties which have both UV-B and UV-C filter activity. Preferably, the term "UV filter" or "UV filter activity" is used for compounds, compositions or moieties which have UV-A or UV-B filter activity or for compounds, compositions or moieties which have both UV-A and UV-B filter activity.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the process for producing these novel microcapsules with UV filter activity, to sunscreen compositions comprising the microcapsules and to the use of the microcapsules for producing a sunscreen composition.<br>
The present invention employs methods of preparing microcapsules which are well known in the art and which have in the past been used to prepare encapsulated UV filters. However, contrary to the prior art technology, according to the present invention all compounds with UV filter activity are covalently bonded to the monomers which form the matrix of the microcapsules. The novel UV filters in the form of microcapsules combine several advantages which could not be achieved with the UV filters of the prior art. In particular a leakage of the monomeric UV filters causing the risk of penetration into the skin and allergic reactions or skin diseases no longer exists. Furthermore, since most of the chromophores with UV filter activity are covalently bonded within the microcapsules and only a small amount of the chromophores with UV filter activity is present on the surface of the microcapsules, there is no risk that a significant number of the UV filter-active sites of the microcapsules come into contact with non-compatible components such as other UV<br><br>
filter-active molecules, which might lead to an inactivation of the UV filter activity, a problem which still occurs with the UV filters disclosed in EP-A 1 205 177 and EP-A 1 205 178.<br>
An important feature of the microcapsules of the present invention and the process for producing them is that no monomeric non-crosslinkable chromophores having UV filter activity are present during the formation of the microcapsules, e.g. during the sol-gel process. Thus, it is ensured that all chromophores with UV filter activity which are present in the so prepared microcapsules are covalently bonded to the polymeric matrix of the microcapsules. There might be a minor amount of contamination by unreacted crosslinkable chromophores which is not relevant for the invention and should be avoided as far as possible. Preferably the microcapsules of the present invention do not contain any unreacted crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity.<br>
The crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity are novel compounds, and the present invention is also directed to those crosslinkable chromophores.<br>

wherein R' is hydrogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain C1-20-alky!, -alkoxy or C2-20-alkenyl.<br>
Preferably, the crosslinkable chromophore with UV filter activity is obtainable by reacting a silane molecule, e.g. of the formula Si(R)r(Q)qS, wherein R is a hydrolysable group as defined above, in particular an alkoxy group or an acyloxy group with 10 carbon atoms or less, Q is a non-hydrolysable group as defined above, in particular a C1-C6 alkyl group, e.g. methyl, S is a reactive group which can react with the chromophore, in particular a hydrogen atom, a group -(CH2)o-NCO, a group -(CH2)0-CI or a group -(CH2)O-NH2, r is 2 or 3, q is 0 or 1 and 0 is 1 to 6, such as<br><br><br>
wherein Alk is a C1-C6 alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl,<br>
and a corresponding molecule with a chromophore selected e.g. from<br><br><br><br>
wherein R' is hydrogen, hyciroxy, straight or branched chain C1-20-alkyl, -alkoxy or C2-20-alkenyl without being limited thereto.<br>
It is also possible to prepare the crosslinkable chromophores by polymerizing one or more of the hydrolysable metal or semi-metal compounds, in particular the silane compounds mentioned above with each other or with other monomers such as the crosslinkable monomers  with  no  UV filter activity defined  below.   In  this  case  the  crosslinkable<br><br>
chromophore is an oligomer which comprises one or more of the UV filter active moieties A.<br>
Usually such an oligomer is constituted from 50 monomer units or less, preferably from 20<br>
monomer units or less, more preferably of 10 monomer units or less. Preferably such an<br>
oligomeric crosslinkable chromophore comprises 5 or less UV filter active moieties A, more<br>
preferably 3 or less, most preferably 1 UV filter active moiety A.	.<br>
The crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity can be subjected to a crosslinking reaction per se or they can be subjected to a crosslinking reaction in the presence of crosslinkable monomers which do not have UV filter activity. Preferably, the crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity are subjected to a crosslinking reaction with crosslinkable monomers without UV filter activity, because this easily allows to adjust the amount of UV filter active moieties in the final microcapsules. Alternatively, it is also possible to adjust the amount of UV filter active moieties in the final microcapsules by crosslinking oligomers which have been prepared from monomers with UV filter activity and monomers with no UV filter activity as discussed above.<br>
The crosslinkable monomers with no UV filter activity are preferably compounds of the formula M(R)n(Q)q, wherein M is a metallic or semi-metallic element such as silicon, titanium, zinc, aluminum or zirconium, preferably silicon, R is a hydrolysable substituent as defined above, preferably with not more than 10 carbon atoms, such as an alkoxide, an aryloxide, carboxylic ester, acyloxy group, diketonato group, hydrolysable aza group or a chlorine atom, preferably an alkoxide, an aryloxide or an acyloxy group, more preferably an alkoxide or an aryloxy group with 10 carbon atoms or less, in particular a C1-C6 alkoxide, most preferably methoxide or ethoxide, and n is an integer from 2 to 4, preferably 3 or 4, most preferably 4. Q is as defined above and q is 0 or 1, n+q=4.<br>
Particularly preferred are crosslinkable monomers such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), tetramethoxysilane (TEMOS), methyltriethoxysilane (METEOS) or partially hydrolyzed and/or partially condensed polymers (oligomers) thereof or a mixture of the above. Suitable crosslinkable monomers are also disclosed e.g. in EP-A 216 278, and the other documents listed below which disclose details of the sol-gel process and which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
While the method for producing the microcapsules of the present invention is not particularly limited and all methods which are well known to a skilled person can principally be used, it<br><br>
is preferred to prepare the microcapsules by a sol-gel process, in particular if the crosslinkable monomers are metallic or semi-metallic compounds as defined above. The sol-gel process for producing microcapsules is well known to a skilled person. In the sol-gel method the crosslinkable monomers, preferably the silanes with and without UV filter activity as defined above are e.g. emulsified under high shear forces in an aqueous solution containing surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and the like and/or protective colloids such as PVP (polyvinylpyrolidon), PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) and the like that assist in stabilizing the emulsion. The obtained emulsion is mixed with an aqueous solution at a suitably selected pH value (basic, neutral or acidic) until spheres are formed. The spheres are then crosslinked under the formation of Si-O-Si bonds, e.g. by applying heat or changing the pH value, and a three-dimensional network is formed. The details of this process are well known, and it can be referred e.g. to WO 00/09652 and WO 00/72806, the content of which is included herein by reference insofar as it relates to the process for producing microcapsules. Other processes usable for the preparation of microcapsules via a sol-gel method are described e.g. in DE 41 24 588 and to EP 216 278. Regarding the sol-gel process it can also be referred e.g. to Colloid Polym. Sci. (2003) 281:19-26, DE-A 195 37 415.<br>
Regarding the process steps and process conditions for preparing microcapsules by the sol-gel method it can also be referred to EP-A 216 278, WO 98/31333, US 6,303,149, EP-A 281 034 and EP-A 941 761, the content of which regarding the sol-gel process is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred are the processes disclosed in EP-A 216 278 and US 6,303,149, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. A particularly preferred process is also disclosed in the examples.<br>
The preparation of the microcapsules of the present invention by the sol-gel process has the advantage that the product obtained by this process is already in the form of a suspension containing about 1 to 80% solids consisting of sphere particles of 0.01-10 µm which can directly be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. If advantageous, the product can also be dried and the product be used in the form of a dried powder.<br>
Preferably, the microcapsules of the present invention have a particle size of 0.01-100 µm, more preferably of 0.01-10 µm. The amount of UV filter active moieties in the microcapsules is 10 to 80% w/w, more preferably 25 to 50% w/w. The above percentages relate to the<br><br>
weight of the UV filter active moieties A in the matrix material and are based on the total weight of the matrix material. The particle size is a mean particle size dv (0.5), if nothing else is stated.<br>
It is possible that the microcapsules of the present invention contain two or more types of chromophores without the risk that there is an inactivation between the chromophore moieties, because the chromophore moieties are covalently bonded to the matrix material and therefore the risk of contact between the chromophore moieties is low. In a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention one or two kinds of crosslinkable chromophores are subjected to the crosslinking reaction, in particular the sol-gel process, most preferably together with at least one kind of crosslinkable monomer which does not have any UV filter activity. The microcapsules of the present invention thus preferably contain one or two different kinds of UV filter active moieties A as defined above, in a preferred embodiment only one kind of chromophore moieties as defined above in a ratio of 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably of 7:3 to 3:7, and in particular of about 1:1 to the crosslinkable monomer which does not have any UV filter activity. The ratio is based on a weight by weight basis.<br>
The microcapsules of the present invention can be included within sunscreen compositions in manners well known to a skilled person. The sunscreen compositions are generally topical sunscreen compositions.<br>
Surprisingly, the sunscreen compositions which are prepared with the microcapsules of the present invention have an excellent sunprotective factor which decrease only slightly if at all during storage or after being applied to the skin, even if two or more different UV filter active components are present which would usually inactivate each other.<br>
For the preparation of the topical sunscreen compositions, especially preparations for dermatological and/or cosmetic use, such as skin protection and sunscreen formulations for everyday cosmetics microcapsules carrying a covalent bonded UV-filter can be incorporated in auxiliary agents, e.g. a cosmetic base, which are conventionally used for such formulations. Where convenient, other conventional UV-A and/or UV-B and/ or broad spectrum screening agents may also be added. The combination of UV screens may show a synergistic effect. The amount of the microcapsules carrying a covalently bonded UV-filter and other known UV-screens is not critical. Suitable amounts of the microcapsules carrying<br><br>
a covalently bonded UV-filter are about 10 to about 50% by weight (depending on the payload and volume fraction of the microcapsules) and about 0.5-12% by weight of at least one additional, hydrophilic and/or lipophilic UV-A or UV-B or broad spectrum screening agent. These additional screening agents are advantageously selected from among the compounds listed below without being limited thereto:<br>

propanedioic acid, [[4-(2-propynyloxy)phenyl]methylene]diethyl ester in 100 ml of toluene<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 70°C and a catalytic<br>
amount of divinyl-tetramethyl disiloxane platinum complex was added. After the reaction<br>
mixture was heated for 2 hours, the solution was concentrated and filtrated over Celite to<br>
yield   7.1g   (100%)   of   2-[[4-[2-(trimethoxysilyl)prop-2enyloxy]benzylidene]-malonic   acid<br>
diethyl ester as yellow oil. UV(ethanol) 312 nm (24'623).<br><br>

2-[[4-[2-(triethoxysilyl)prop2-enyloxy]benzylidene]-malonic acid diethyl ester A 1000ml round bottom flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and an oil bath with a magnetic stirrec. was charged with 72g .(0-44mol) triethoxysilane and 120g (0.4mol) of propanedioic acid [[4-(2-propynyloxy)phenyl]methylene]diethyl ester in 500 ml of toluene under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 70°C and a catalytic amount of divinyl-tetramethyl disiloxane platinum complex was added. After the reaction mixture was heated for 20 hours, another 6.6g (0.04mol) triethoxysilane are added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 4h. Afterwards, the solution was concentrated, dissolved in dichloromethane and washed twice with water. After drying over NaSO4 the organic phase is concentrated and purified via column chromatography (hexane/ EtOAc) yielding 35.4 g (19%) of 2-[[4-[2~(triethoxysilyl)prop2-enyloxy]benzylidene]-malonic acid diethyl ester as yellow oil. UV(ethanol) 314 nm (23'926).<br>
Example 6<br>
1.5g of 2-[[4-[2-(triethoxysilyl)prop2-enyloxy]benzylidene]-malonic acid diethyl ester prepared as described in example 5 was dissolved in 7,5g Tetraethoxysilane. The organic phase was emulsified in 50g of an aqueous solution containing 1% cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CETAC) under high shear forces using an Ultra Tourrax T-25 basic at 17500rpm.This emulsion was then poured into a 250ml round flask containing 50g of aqueous NaOH solution at pH 11 at 60°C and stirred for 3 days. The final suspension contained microcapsules loaded with 20% w/w chromophore and a particle size dv(0.5) = 5|im. The obtained powder was incorporated into an emulsion as described in Example 7 yielding an in vitro SPF value of 5.<br><br><br>
