[invention Title]<br>
BANDWIDTH REQUEST METHOD AND BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION METHOD IN<br>
BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS SYSTEM<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless access system and,<br>
more particularly, to a method of a mobile station for efficiently<br>
requesting a bandwidth to a base station and a mobile station performing<br>
the same.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Hereinafter, a protocol layer model being defined in a general<br>
broadband wireless access system will first be described.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a protocol layer model defined in a generally<br>
used IEEE 802.16 system based wireless mobile telecommunications<br>
system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a MAC layer belonging to a link layer may<br>
consist of 3 sublayers. First of all, a Service-Specific CS<br>
(Service-Specific Convergence Sublayer) may modify or map data of<br>
an external network received through a CS SAP (Service Access Point)<br>
to MAC SDUs (Service Data Units) of a MAC CPS (Common Part Sublayer) .<br>
A function of associating a respective MAC SFID (Service Flow<br>
IDentifier) and a CID (Connection IDentifier), after identifying the<br>
SDUs of the external network, may be included in this layer.<br>
Subsequently, as a layer providing the essential functions of<br>
the MAC, such as systemaccess, bandwidth allocation, connection set-up<br>
and management, the MAC CPS receives data from various CSs through<br>
the MAC SAP, wherein the received data are classified by a specific<br>
MAC connection . At this point, a QoS (Quality of Service) may be applied<br>
to data transmission and scheduling through a physical layer.<br>
Furthermore, a Security Sublayer may provide Authentication,<br>
security key exchange, and encryption functions.<br>
As a connection-oriented service, the MAC layer is realized by<br>
the concept of transport connection. When a mobile station (or<br>
terminal) is registered to the system, a Service Flow may be regulated<br>
in accordance with an agreement between the mobile station and the<br>
system. If a service request is changed, a new connectionmay be set-up .<br>
Herein, the transport (or transmission) connection defines a mapping<br>
between peer convergence processors using MAC and the service flow.<br>
And, the service flow defines QoS parameters of the MAC PDU, which<br>
are exchanged in the corresponding connection.<br>
The service flow within the transport connection performs an<br>
essential role in operating a MAC protocol and provides a mechanism<br>
for QoS management of an uplink and a downlink.<br>
In a general IEEE 802 . 16 system, the mobile station (or terminal)<br>
may have a universal MAC address having the length of 48 bits for<br>
each wireless interface. This address uniquely defines the wireless<br>
interface of the mobile station, and this address may be used for<br>
setting up the connection of the mobile station during an initial<br>
ranging procedure . Additionally, since the base station verifies each<br>
of the mobile stations with a different mobile station identifier<br>
(ID) , the universal MAC address maybe usedaspartof the authentication<br>
process.<br>
Each connection may be identified by a CID (Connection I Dent if ier)<br>
having the length of 16 bits. While the initialization of the mobile<br>
station is under process, two pairs (uplink and downlink) of management<br>
connectionmay be set up between the mobile station and the base station,<br>
and, including a management connection, a total of 3 pairs may be<br>
optionally (or selectively) used.<br>
Within the above-described layer structure, the transmitting<br>
end and the receiving end may exchange data or control messages through<br>
aMACPDU (MediumAccess Control Packet Data Unit) . In order to generate<br>
such a MAC PDU, the base station or the mobile station may include<br>
a MAC header in the MAC PDU.<br>
The mobile station may request for an uplink bandwidth by<br>
transmitting bandwidth request information in a MAC signaling header<br>
format or a MAC sub-header format. At this point, the mobile station<br>
requests for an uplink bandwidth in connection units between the mobile<br>
station and the base station. Hereinafter a general header structure<br>
will be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary MAC header format being used<br>
in an IEEE 802.16 system based wireless MAN mobile telecommunications<br>
system. Hereinafter, in the description of the present invention,<br>
in a block showing the header structure including FIG. 2, one graduation<br>
of indicates 1 bit, and one horizontal row indicates 1 byte. And,<br>
it is shown in FIG. 2 that, from top to bottom, the most significant<br>
bit (MSB) and the least significant bit (LSB) are sequentially arranged<br>
within the structure.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in addition to a generic (or general) MAC<br>
header (GMH) , 6 sub-headers may be used in the MAC PDU. A sub-header<br>
for each MAC PDU is inserted after the generic MAC header. Hereinafter,<br>
each field being included in the MAC header will be described in detail.<br>
An HT (Header Type) field corresponds to a field indicating the<br>
header type. Herein, the HT field indicates whether the corresponding<br>
MAC PDU is a generic MAC header including a payload after the header<br>
or whether the corresponding MAC PDU is a signaling header for<br>
controlling a BR (Bandwidth Request) . AnEC (Encryption Control) field<br>
corresponds to a field indicating encryption control. Herein the EC<br>
header indicates whether or not the payload is encrypted. A Type field<br>
corresponds to a field indicating whether or not a sub-header comes<br>
after the header and also indicating the type of the sub-header. An<br>
ESF (Extended Subheader Field) field indicates whether or not an<br>
extension sub-header comes after the header.<br>
Also, a CI (CRC Indication) field indicates whether or not a<br>
CRC comes after a payload. When a payload is encrypted, an EKS<br>
(Encryption Key Sequence) field indicates an encryption key sequence<br>
number being used for the encryption. A LEN (LENgth) field indicates<br>
the length of the MAC PDU. And, a CID (Connection Identifier) field<br>
indicates a connection identifier being delivered by the MAC PDU.<br>
Herein, the CID performs the function of identifying a specific mobile<br>
station or performs the function of identifying a specific service<br>
between the base station and the mobile station. And, an HCS (Header<br>
Check Sequence) is used for detecting an error of the header. In FIG.<br>
2, the numbers shown in parentheses after the names of each field<br>
respectively indicate the number of bits occupied by each field.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a MAC signaling header type 1 being used in<br>
a wireless MAN mobile telecommunications system, which is based on<br>
a generally used IEEE 802.16 system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, since the Signaling header Type 1 corresponds<br>
to a signaling header, the value of the header type (HT) field is<br>
set to ^1', and the value of the encryption control (EC) field is<br>
set to '0'. The description of the type field is as shown in Table<br>
1 below.<br>
[Table l]<br>
As shown in Table 1, depending upon the value to the type field,<br>
the Header Content field may have a different format. For example,<br>
when the type field has the value of "000" or "001", the MAC signaling<br>
header is used as the BR (Bandwidth Request) header. The header format<br>
of this case will be described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary bandwidth request header being<br>
transmitted to a base station, when a mobile station requests for<br>
a bandwidth in the IEEE 802.16 system.<br>
A detailed description on the fields included in the bandwidth<br>
request header shown in FIG. 4 is shown in Table 2 below.<br>
[Table 2]<br>
When requesting an uplink bandwidth by using the header as shown<br>
in FIG. 4, the mobile station may request for up to a maximum of 512<br>
KB.<br>
In a general system, e.g., in a system following the IEEE 802.16e<br>
standard, a bandwidth can be requested by using the above-described<br>
header. However, in the newly developed (or latest) system, e.g.,<br>
in a wireless telecommunications system following the IEEE 802.16m<br>
standard (WirelssMAN-OFDMA advanced system only or WirelessMAN-OFDMA<br>
Reference System/WirelessMAN-OFDMA Advanced co-existing System), a<br>
more advanced and efficient method for requesting a bandwidth, as<br>
compared to the method used in the general system, is required to<br>
be defined.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to provide an<br>
efficient method of a mobile station for requesting a bandwidth that<br>
substantially obviates one or more of the above-described general<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a quick method<br>
of a mobile station for requesting a bandwidth that does not require<br>
a process of the mobile station requesting a base station for an uplink<br>
resource for transmitting a bandwidth request message.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an efficient<br>
method for requesting a bandwidth, wherein the base station provides<br>
different bandwidth request channels to the mobile station for each<br>
mobile station group, the mobile station groups being categorized<br>
by a predetermined categorization standard.<br>
Additional objects and features of the present application will<br>
be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part<br>
will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon<br>
examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the<br>
present application.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance<br>
with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described<br>
herein, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in a<br>
method of a mobile station for requesting a bandwidth in a broadband<br>
wireless access system, the method for requesting a bandwidth includes<br>
the steps of transmitting a bandwidth request header (BR header)<br>
including a bandwidth request message and a quick access message to<br>
a base station; receiving uplink grant (UL grant) information<br>
corresponding to information included in the bandwidth request message<br>
and the quick access message to the base station; and transmitting<br>
data to the base station by using an uplink resource indicated by<br>
the uplink grant information. Herein, the quick access message may<br>
include at least one of a mobile station identifier for identifying<br>
(or addressing) the mobile station, an identifier for identifying<br>
quality of service (QoS), priority information, size information on<br>
a size of the requested bandwidth, information on a buffer size of<br>
the mobile station, and information on an uplink transmission power<br>
(UL Tx power).<br>
At this point, the method for requesting a bandwidth may further<br>
include the step of receiving allocation information of a bandwidth<br>
request channel corresponding to an uplink resource for transmitting<br>
the bandwidth request header from the base station through a<br>
predetermined broadcast channel. Herein, the step of transmitting<br>
a bandwidth request header (BR header) may correspond to a step of<br>
transmitting the bandwidth request header through the bandwidth<br>
request channel.<br>
Also, the step of transmitting a bandwidth request header (BR<br>
header) may be performed by using a contention-based method.<br>
Also, it is preferable that the predetermined broadcast channel<br>
corresponds to a secondary super-frame header (S-SFH).<br>
Also, the bandwidth request channel may be allocated for each<br>
of at least one or more groups, the groups being categorized based<br>
upon a predetermined standard.<br>
Also, the predetermined standard may be determined by taking<br>
into consideration at least one of priority level, service type, and<br>
mobile station identifier.<br>
Also, the at least one or more groups may be allocated through<br>
any one of a SubscriberStation Basic Capability (SBC) procedure or<br>
a Dynamic Service Addition (DSA) procedure.<br>
Also, the at least one or more groups may be allocated through<br>
any one of a broadcast station identifier (broadcast STID) and a<br>
multicast station identifier (multicast STID).<br>
Furthermore, the priority information may include at least one<br>
of an emergency transmission status, a level according to a capability<br>
of the mobile station, and a user level of the mobile station determined<br>
a telecommunications service provider.<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance<br>
with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described<br>
herein, according to another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
in a method of a base station allocating a bandwidth to a mobile station<br>
in a broadband wireless access system, the method for allocating a<br>
bandwidth includes the steps of receiving a bandwidth request header<br>
(BR header) including a bandwidth request message and a quick access<br>
message from the mobile station; transmitting uplink grant (UL grant)<br>
information corresponding to information included in the bandwidth<br>
request message and the quick access message to the mobile station;<br>
and receiving data from the mobile station through an uplink resource<br>
indicated by the uplink grant information. Herein, the quick access<br>
message may include at least one of a mobile station identifier for<br>
identifying (or addressing) the mobile station, an identifier for<br>
identifying quality of service (QoS), priority information, size<br>
information on a size of the requested bandwidth, information on a<br>
buffer size of the mobile station, and information on an uplink<br>
transmission power (UL Tx power).<br>
At this point, it is preferable that the method for allocating<br>
a bandwidth further includes the step of broadcasting allocation<br>
information of a bandwidth request channel corresponding to an uplink<br>
resource for receiving the bandwidth request header through a<br>
predetermined broadcast channel. Herein, the step of receiving a<br>
bandwidth request header (BR header) may correspond to a step of<br>
receiving the bandwidth request header through the bandwidth request<br>
channel.<br>
Also, the step of receiving a bandwidth request header (BRheader)<br>
may be performed by using a contention-based method.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the predetermined broadcast<br>
channel corresponds to a secondary super-frame header (S-SFH).<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance<br>
with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described<br>
herein, according to yet another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
in a mobile station, the mobile station includes a processor; a receiving<br>
module; a transmitting module; and an antenna configured to transmit<br>
radio signals received from an external source to the receiving module<br>
and to transmit radio signals being delivered from the transmitting<br>
module to an external source.<br>
Herein, the receiving module may perform demodulating and<br>
decoding on the wireless signals being delivered from the antenna,<br>
the transmitting module may perform modulating and encoding on the<br>
data being delivered from the processor, and the processor may control<br>
the transmitting module so that the transmitting module can generate<br>
a bandwidth request header (BR header) including a bandwidth request<br>
message and a quick access message corresponding to a size of data<br>
that are to be transmitted to abase station, and so that the transmitting<br>
module can transmit the generated bandwidth request header to the<br>
base station, and the process may control the transmitting module<br>
so that, when uplink grant (UL grant) information corresponding to<br>
information included in the bandwidth request message and the quick<br>
access message to are delivered from the receiving module, the<br>
transmitting module can use an uplink resource indicated by the uplink<br>
grant information so as to transmit the data to the base station.<br>
At this point, the quick access message includes at least one<br>
of a mobile station identifier for identifying (or addressing) the<br>
mobile station, an identifier for identifying quality of service (QoS) ,<br>
priority information, size information on a size of the requested<br>
bandwidth, information on a buffer size of the mobile station, and<br>
information on an uplink transmission power (UL Tx power).<br>
Furthermore, the controller may control the receiving module<br>
so that allocation information of a bandwidth request channel<br>
corresponding to an uplink resource for receiving the bandwidth request<br>
header can be received from the base station through a predetermined<br>
broadcast channel, and the controller may control the transmitting<br>
module so that the bandwidth request header can be transmitted through<br>
the bandwidth request channel.<br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
According to the embodiments of the present invention, the present<br>
invention has the following advantages.<br>
First of all, according to the present invention, the mobile<br>
station may more efficiently request for a bandwidth to the base station.<br>
Secondly, according to the present invention, without performing<br>
a process of requesting the base station for an uplink resource for<br>
transmitting a bandwidth request message, the mobile station may use<br>
the uplink resource periodically allocated (or assigned) thereto so<br>
as to transmit the bandwidth request message to the base station.<br>
Thirdly, according to the present invention, since the base<br>
station allocates (or assigns) different bandwidth request channels<br>
to the mobile station for each mobile station group, wherein the mobile<br>
station groups is categorized by a predetermined categorization<br>
standard, the mobile station may be capable of efficiently performing<br>
a contention base bandwidth request.<br>
Finally, according to the procedure defined in the present<br>
invention, in a systemof a newly developed standard, the mobile station<br>
may transmit supplementary information (Quick Access message) to the<br>
base station, thereby efficiently performing the bandwidth request.<br>
Additional advantages of the present application will be set<br>
forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become<br>
apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination<br>
of the following or may be learned from practice of the present<br>
application.<br>

inside or outside of the processor, and the memory unit may transmit<br>
and receive data to and from the processor by using a wide range of<br>
methods that have already been disclosed.<br>
Herein, the embodiments of the present invention may be supported<br>

The method for requesting a bandwidth in a broadband wireless<br>
access system is divided into a contention-based request method and<br>
a contention-free request method. The contention-based request<br>
method corresponds to a method wherein a plurality of users is in<br>
contention to request for a bandwidth in a single channel. The<br>
contention-free method corresponds to a method wherein each user sends<br>
a bandwidth request to its allocated (or assigned) channel. When using<br>
the contention-free method, the mobile station may send a bandwidth<br>
request message in a unicast method through a channel allocated by<br>
a polling of the base station. Alternatively, the mobile station may<br>
send a bandwidth request message by using a piggy back method to a<br>
remaining region of the bandwidth initially allocated (or assigned)<br>
by the base station. Hereinafter, the contention-based request method<br>
will first be described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a 5-step bandwidth request procedure of the<br>
mobile station using a general contention-based request method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, when data that are to be transmitted to<br>
the base station are generated, the mobile station first transmits<br>
a Bandwidth Request Indicator to the base station (S510) .<br>
More specifically, as an example of the Bandwidth Request<br>
Indicator, among the CDMA codes for a contention-based bandwidth<br>
request (i.e., BR codes (Bandwidth Request codes)), a CDMA ranging<br>
code (sequence or ranging preamble code) may be randomly selected<br>
by the mobile station. Among the uplink resource, the mobile station<br>
may transmit the selected code to a slot, which is randomly selected<br>
from a region allocated by the base station for the Bandwidth Request<br>
in the uplink resource.<br>
If the base station recognizes the CDMA code transmitted by the<br>
mobile station, the base station uses a CDMA allocation information<br>
element (CDMA_Allocation_IE) so as to allocate a resource to which<br>
the mobile station is to transmit a bandwidth request message (S520) .<br>
After receiving the information on the uplink resource for<br>
transmitting the bandwidth request message, the mobile station<br>
transmits the bandwidth request message to the corresponding resource<br>
region. At this point, the mobile stationmay use the bandwidth request<br>
header (BR header) , and the header includes information on the size<br>
of the requested bandwidth and the service type (S530).<br>
The base station may transmit a response to the bandwidth request<br>
message transmitted from the mobile station to the mobile station,<br>
and, if the bandwidth requested by the mobile station is available,<br>
the base station allocates the uplink resource corresponding to the<br>
information included in the header to the mobile station (S540) .<br>
The mobile station transmits data to the allocated uplink resource<br>
(S550) . At this point, if the allocated uplink resource remains, the<br>
mobile station may additionally request for resource allocation to<br>
the base station by using the piggy back method.<br>
Subsequently, the bandwidth request process using the<br>
contention-free request method will now be described in detail with<br>
reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an uplink resource allocation procedure of<br>
the mobile station using polling among general non-contention request<br>
methods.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the base station periodically allocates<br>
an uplink resource enabling the mobile station to transmit a bandwidth<br>
request message through a polling process (S610).<br>
The mobile station uses the allocated uplink resource so as to<br>
transmit a bandwidth request message to the base station by using<br>
the contention-free request method, wherein the bandwidth request<br>
message uses a bandwidth request header (BR header) including<br>
information on the bandwidth corresponding to the size of the data<br>
that are to be transmitted by the mobile station (S620) .<br>
After receiving the corresponding bandwidth request, when the<br>
requested bandwidth is available, the base station allocates the uplink<br>
resource to the mobile station (S630).<br>
The mobile station then transmits the corresponding data to the<br>
uplink region allocated by the base station (S640).<br>
First Embodiment<br>
In a system more evolved (or advanced) than the general system,<br>
e.g., in a system following the IEEE 802.16m standard, in order to<br>
enable the mobile station to request the base station for a bandwidth,<br>
information other than those of the general system may be required.<br>
More specifically, in a bandwidth request header (BR Header)<br>
of the IEEE 802.16e system, a mobile station and a QoS (Quality of<br>
Service) may be identified by using a CID (Connection IDentifier)<br>
having the length of 16 bits. However, in an IEEE 802.16m system,<br>
a station identifier (STID) is used as a logical identifier for<br>
identifying themobile station. And, a connection of themobile station<br>
or the respective QoS may be identified through a flow identifier<br>
(FID).<br>
Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention proposes<br>
a method enabling the mobile station to efficiently transmit the<br>
above-described information to the base station, so as to request<br>
a bandwidth.<br>
In order to do so, the present invention proposes a Quick Access<br>
message. Herein, a Quick Access message refers to a message including<br>
information that is to be transmitted by the mobile station to the<br>
base station, in an advanced system, in order to request for a bandwidth.<br>
Such Quick Access message may include information for identifying<br>
the mobile station (AMS (Advanced Mobile Station)) (AMS addressing<br>
information (e.g., STID)), information on the size of the bandwidth<br>
that is to be requested (request size), information on an uplink<br>
transmission power (Uplink transmit power report or UL Tx power),<br>
a QoS identifier (e.g., FID), information on a buffer size of the<br>
mobile station, information on the priority level, and so on.<br>
Herein, when a Quick Access message is transmitted to the base<br>
station, the information on the Uplink transmit power report may<br>
indicate the power level used, or may indicate the remaining power<br>
from the maximum available power level of the mobile station.<br>
Furthermore, the information on the priority level may correspond<br>
to whether or not emergency transmission has been performed, priority<br>
levels respective to the mobile station class, or user level determined<br>
by the communications service provider.<br>
The Quick Access message including the above-described<br>
information may be transmitted along with the bandwidth request<br>
indicator in step S510 of FIG. 5 or with the bandwidth request message<br>
in step S530 of FIG. 5.<br>
In case the Quick Access message is transmitted along with the<br>
bandwidth request message, the Quick Access message may be transmitted<br>
to the base station through a bandwidth request header (BR header)<br>
for transmitting the bandwidth request message . In other words, each<br>
set of information included in the Quick Access message may be included<br>
in the bandwidth request header in the form of fields configuring<br>
the bandwidth request header.<br>
Accordingly, by using the method provided in the embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the mobile station may efficiently transmit<br>
information for requesting a bandwidth to the base station in an advanced<br>
system, without having to separately perform any additional process<br>
steps.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, by<br>
having the base station allocate an uplink resource enabling the mobile<br>
station to periodically transmit a bandwidth request message, the<br>
present invention provides a method enabling the mobile station to<br>
request for an uplink resource to the base station more quickly.<br>
In the general contention-based bandwidth request method<br>
described above with reference to FIG. 5, a delay may occur due to<br>
the procedure for being allocated with the uplink resource for<br>
transmitting the bandwidth request message, i.e., due to the process<br>
of transmitting a Bandwidth Request Indicator to the base station<br>
and the process of receiving an uplink resource information for<br>
transmitting a bandwidth request message as a response to the<br>
transmitted bandwidth request indicator (i.e., UL grant for BW REQ<br>
message) . This procedure will be described in detail with reference<br>
to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a general contention based 5-step bandwidth<br>
request procedure in a frame structure of an IEEE 802.16m system.<br>
In FIG. 7, a super-frame has the length of 2 0ms and includes<br>
4 frames. Herein, it is assumed that one frame includes 8 sub-frames,<br>
and, according to TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) 5 of the sub-frames<br>
are allocated as downlink sub-frames, and that the remaining 3<br>
sub-frames are allocated as uplink sub-frames. Furthermore, since<br>
the details on each step are similar to those of FIG. 5, the detailed<br>
description of the same will be omitted for simplicity.<br>
First of all, when data that are to be transmitted to the base<br>
station are generated, the mobile station uses one of the uplink<br>
sub-frames included in the last frame of the first super-frame to<br>
transmit a Bandwidth Request Indicator to the base station (S710) .<br>
Then, as a response to the received Bandwidth Request Indicator,<br>
the base station allocates an uplink resource for transmitting a<br>
bandwidth request message (CDMA alloc IE or UL grant for BW REQ) to<br>
the mobile station through a downlink sub-frame of the next frame<br>
(S720).<br>
The mobile station uses the allocated uplink resource (in case<br>
of FIG. 7, the mobile station uses an uplink sub-frame included in<br>
the same frame as the frame to which the CDMA alloc IE is transmitted)<br>
so as to transmit the bandwidth request message to the base station<br>
(S730) .<br>
Thereafter, the base station allocates information on the uplink<br>
resource (UL grant), which corresponds to the information included<br>
in the bandwidth request message, to the mobile station through a<br>
downlink sub-frame of the next frame (S740) .<br>
The mobile station uses the uplink resource indicated by an uplink<br>
grant (UL grant) information (in case of FIG. 7, the mobile station<br>
uses an uplink sub-frame included in the same frame as the frame to<br>
which the UL grant is transmitted) so as to transmit data to the base<br>
station (S750) .<br>
In case of the above-described FIG. 7, while being processed<br>
over the 5 steps, by using an uplink sub-frame and a downlink sub-frame<br>
of each frame, a total of 3 frames are used herein. If the process<br>
step S710 and step S720 can be omitted, the mobile station may be<br>
able to request for a bandwidth with more efficiency. In order to<br>
do so, this embodiment of the present invention proposes a method<br>
of having the mobile station periodically allocate an uplink resource,<br>
which can transmit the bandwidth request message using a<br>
contention-based method, and also a method of transmitting information<br>
on the allocated uplink resource through a predetermined broadcast<br>
channel. This process will hereinafter be described in more detail<br>
with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a bandwidth request procedure of the mobile<br>
station using a contention based request method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the base station (or ABS (Advanced Base<br>
Station)) may transmit information on uplink resources (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "BR (Bandwidth Request) channel information") , which<br>
are allocated so that the mobile station (AMS) can transmit the bandwidth<br>
request message by using the contention-based method through a<br>
predetermined broadcast channel (hereinafter referred to as a "BR<br>
(Bandwidth Request) channel") to the mobile station (S810).<br>
Herein, it is preferable that the predetermined broadcast channel<br>
is a Super Frame Header (SFH). More preferably, the predetermined<br>
broadcast channel may be a broadcast channel (BCH) of the super frame<br>
header, i.e.', a secondary super frame header (S-SFH) .<br>
Furthermore, the BR channel may correspond to an uplink resource<br>
identical to that of the generally used 5-step method for requesting<br>
a bandwidth, which is described with reference to FIG. 5, or the BR<br>
channel may correspond to an uplink resource that- is separately<br>
allocated to each group, which is classified (or differentiated) by<br>
mobile station type, service type, or priority level. In case the<br>
BR channel is differentiated for each group, a time-division method<br>
may be used. More specifically, a BR channel for each group may be<br>
allocated to different uplink sub-frames of each group, or a BR channel<br>
for each group may be allocated to different symbol regions.<br>
If a group is set-up, the group may be decided by SBC<br>
(Subscriber Station Basic Capability) or DSA (Dynamic Service Addition)<br>
procedures between the mobile station and the base station, and, then,<br>
the decided group may be notified to the mobile station.<br>
In this case, the base station may allocate any one identifier<br>
for identifying (or addressing) a group to which the mobile station<br>
belongs through the SBC procedure or the DSA procedure. Examples of<br>
the identifiers may include a broadcast connection identifier<br>
(broadcast CID), a multicast connection identifier (multicast CID) ,<br>
a broadcast station identifier (broadcast STID), and a multicast<br>
station identifier (multicast STID).<br>
When data that are to be transmitted to the base station are<br>
generated, the mobile station transmits a bandwidth request message<br>
to the corresponding BR channel based upon the information acquired<br>
in step S810.<br>
At this point, the bandwidth request message may be transmitted<br>
to the base station in a bandwidth request header (BR header) format.<br>
And, the bandwidth request messagemay include a preamble and additional<br>
information enabling the mobile station to request for the bandwidth<br>
to the base station, wherein the additional information may correspond<br>
to a Quick Access message.<br>
Herein, as described in the embodiment of the present invention,<br>
in addition to the conventional preamble (i.e., ranging preamble<br>
sequence), the Quick Access message may include an identifier for<br>
identifying (or addressing) the mobile station (CID or STID), QoS<br>
level information (i.e., an identifier for identifying the QoS (SF<br>
ID or FID)), information on the priority level, information on the<br>
size of the bandwidth that is being requested (BR length) , information<br>
on a buffer size of the mobile station, information on an uplink<br>
transmission power (UL Tx power or Uplink transmit power report),<br>
and so on.<br>
Herein, when a Quick Access message is transmitted to the base<br>
station, the information on the Uplink transmit power report may<br>
indicate the power level used, or may indicate the remaining power<br>
from the maximum available power level of the mobile station.<br>
Furthermore, the information on the priority level may correspond<br>
to whether or not emergency transmission has been performed, priority<br>
levels respective to the mobile station class, or user level determined<br>
by the communications service provider.<br>
After receiving the bandwidth request message including the<br>
above-described information, the base station may transmit a response<br>
signal respective to the received bandwidth request message to the<br>
mobile station. Based upon the information included in the bandwidth<br>
request message, the base station allocates an uplink resource to<br>
the mobile station through an uplink grant (UL grant) information<br>
(S830) .<br>
The mobile station may transmit data to the base station through<br>
the uplink resource indicated by the uplink grant (UL grant), and,<br>
if any, remaining resource may be requested for additional allocation<br>
in a piggyback format (S840).<br>
Hereinafter, a delay that may occur when using the above-described<br>
method for requesting a bandwidth will now be described in detail<br>
with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a bandwidth request procedure of the mobile<br>
station using a contention based request method in a frame structure<br>
of an IEEE 802 .16m system according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In FIG. 9, a super-frame has the length of 20ms and includes<br>
4 frames. Herein, it is assumed that one frame includes 8 sub-frames,<br>
and, according to TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) 5 of the sub-frames<br>
are allocated as downlink sub-frames, and that the remaining 3<br>
sub-frames are allocated as uplink sub-frames. Furthermore, since<br>
the details on each step are similar to those of FIG. 8, the detailed<br>
description of the same will be omitted for simplicity.<br>
First of all, BR channel information is included in a broadcast<br>
channel (BCH or S-SFH) of the first super-frame, and the BR channel<br>
information designates a second uplink sub-frame 900 of the last frame<br>
within the same sub-frame as the BR channel (S910).<br>
In case data that are to be transmitted to the base station exist,<br>
the mobile station transmits a bandwidth request message to the BR<br>
channel 900 by using a contention-based method (S920) . At this point,<br>
the above-described quick access message may be included in the<br>
bandwidth request message.<br>
The base station uses the information included in the bandwidth<br>
request message transmitted from the mobile station, so as to transmit<br>
downlink sub-frame of a next frame to the mobile station and uplink<br>
grant (UL grant) information, thereby allocating a bandwidth (S930) .<br>
The mobile station may transmit data to the base station by using<br>
the uplink resource indicated by the UL grant information and, then,<br>
may use the remaining resource so as to request the base station for<br>
additional allocation in a piggyback format (S940).<br>
If data that are to be transmitted to the mobile station generates<br>
from the second super-frame, the mobile station may request the base<br>
station for a bandwidth by using the BR channel 901, which is designated<br>
by the BR channel information included in the super-frame header of<br>
the second super-frame (S940) .<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the above-described method for requesting<br>
a bandwidth may transmit data from a BR channel within a delay<br>
corresponding to one frame. This indicates that the method for<br>
requesting a bandwidth provided by the present invention is<br>
advantageous in showing a large decrease in delay as compared to the<br>
delay corresponding to 3 frames, as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a mobile station and base station that can perform the above-described<br>
embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
The mobile station may operate as a transmitter in an uplink,<br>
and the mobile station may operate as a receiver in a downlink. Also,<br>
the base station may operate as a receiver in an uplink, and the base<br>
stationmay operate as a transmitter in a downlink. More specifically,<br>
the mobile station and the base station may each include a transmitter<br>
and a receiver for transmitting information or data to and from one<br>
another.<br>
The transmitter and receiver may each include a processor, a<br>
module, a part, and/or a medium. Most particularly, the transmitter<br>
and receivermay each include amodule (medium) for encrypting amessage,<br>
a module for interpreting an encrypted message, an antenna for<br>
transmitting and receiving messages, and so on. An example of such<br>
transmitting end and receiving end will now be described in detail<br>
with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a block view showing structures of a<br>
transmitting end and a receiving end according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the left side represents the structure<br>
of the transmitting end, and the right side represents the structure<br>
of the receiving end. Each of the transmitting end and the receiving<br>
end may include an antenna 1000 and 1010, a processor 1020 and 1030,<br>
a transmission module (Tx module) 1040 and 1050, a receiving module<br>
(Rx module) 1060 and 1070, and a memory 1080 and 1090. Each element<br>
may perform its corresponding function. Hereinafter, each element<br>
will now be described in detail.<br>
The antenna 1000 and 1010 either transmits a signal created from<br>
the Tx module 1040 and 1050 to the outside, or receives a wireless<br>
signal from the outside, thereby delivering the received signal to<br>
the Rx module 1060 and 1070. When a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output<br>
(MIMO) antenna function is supported, at least 2 or more antennae<br>
may be provided herein.<br>
The processor 1020 and 1030 generally controls the overall<br>
operations of the transmitting end or the receiving end. Most<br>
particularly, the transmitting end or the receiving end may perform<br>
a controller function for performing the above-described embodiments<br>
of the present invention, a MAC (Medium Access Control) frame variable<br>
control function based upon service characteristics and frequency<br>
environment (or condition), a hand over function, and authentication<br>
and encryption functions.<br>
For example, in performing the process steps associated with<br>
the above-described methods for requesting a bandwidth, the processor<br>
of the mobile station may determine whether or not data that are to<br>
be transmitted to the base station exist. If it is determined that<br>
data, which are to be transmitted to the base station, exist, contents<br>
that are to be included in the bandwidth request method including<br>
a bandwidth request indicator, a quick access message, and information<br>
corresponding to the data that are to be transmitted may be decided<br>
and generated. Also, the process of the mobile stationmay also control<br>
the transmitting module 1050 so that the generated indicator or message<br>
can be transmitted to the base station at an appropriate moment.<br>
Furthermore, the processor 1030 may control the receiving module 1070<br>
so as to interpret the contents included in the MAC message, such<br>
as uplink grant (UL grant) information being transmitted from the<br>
base station, thereby determining and performing an appropriate<br>
responsive operation with respect to the interpreted content.<br>
Additionally, the processor of the base station may interpret<br>
the bandwidth request message, MACmessage, or data that are transmitted<br>
to the base station from the mobile station, so as to allocate the<br>
required uplink resource to the mobile station, and the processor<br>
of the base station may also generate an uplink grant (UL grant) for<br>
notifying the mobile station of the allocation details and perform<br>
scheduling in order to transmit the generated UL grant. Furthermore,<br>
the processor of the base station may allocate identifiers, such as<br>
the STID, FID, and so on, required by the mobile station and may generate<br>
a MAC message including the corresponding information, thereby<br>
transmitting the generated MAC message to the mobile station.<br>
The Tx module 1040 and 1050 may perform predetermined coding<br>
and modulation processes on the data scheduled by the processor 1020<br>
and 1030 and to be transmitted to the outside, thereby delivering<br>
the processed data to the antenna 1010.<br>
The Rx module 1060 and 1070 may perform decoding and demodulation<br>
processes on a wireless signal received from the outside through the<br>
antenna 1000 and 1010, so as to recover the processed data to the<br>
original (or initial) state, thereby delivering the recovered data<br>
to the processor 1020 and 1030.<br>
A program for processing and controlling the processor 1020 and<br>
1030 may be stored in the memory 1080 and 1090. The memory 1080 and<br>
1090 may also perform functions for temporarily storing input/output<br>
data (in case of the mobile station, temporarily storing an uplink<br>
grant (UL grant), system information, STID, FID, operating time, and<br>
so on, which are allocated by the base station). Furthermore, the<br>
memory 1080 and 1090 may include at least one type of storage means,<br>
such as a flash memory type, a hard disk type, a multimedia card micro<br>
type, a card-type memory (e.g., SD or XD memory) , a RAM (Random Access<br>
Memory) , a SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) , a ROM (Read-Only Memory) ,<br>
an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), a<br>
PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), a magnetic memory, a magnetic<br>
disk, and an optical disk.<br>
Meanwhile, the base station may perform a controller function<br>
for performing the above-described embodiments of the present<br>
invention, an OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)<br>
packet scheduling, TDD (Time Division Duplex) packet scheduling, and<br>
channel multiplexing functions, MAC frame variable control function<br>
based upon service characteristics and frequency environment (or<br>
condition), a high-speed traffic real-time control function, a hand<br>
over function, authentication and encoding (or encryption) functions,<br>
packet modulation/demodulation functions for transmitting data, a<br>
high-speed channel coding function, and a real-time modem control<br>
function through at least one of the above-described modules, or the<br>
base station may further include a separate means, module, or part<br>
for performing such functions.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
modifications and variations can be made in the present invention<br>
without departing from the technical and essential spirit or scope<br>
of the invention. Therefore, the detailed description of the present<br>
invention should not be interpreted as limiting in all aspects of<br>
the present invention, but should be considered as exemplary. The<br>
scope of the appended claims of the present invention shall be decided<br>
based upon rational interpretation, and all modifications within the<br>
scope of the appended claims and their equivalents will be included<br>
in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Although the above-described method for requesting a bandwidth<br>
and a mobile station structure for the same have been described in<br>
detail based upon an example being applied to the IEEE 802.16 system,<br>
in addition to the IEEE 802.16 system, the present invention may also<br>
be applied to a wide range of mobile telecommunications systems having<br>
similar procedures for requesting a bandwidth.<br>

14. A mobile station for requesting a bandwidth in a broadband<br>
wireless access system, the mobile station comprising:<br>
a processor;<br>
a receiving module;<br>
a transmitting module; and<br>
an antenna configured to transmit radio signals received from an<br>
external source to the receiving module and to transmit radio signals<br>
being delivered from the transmitting module to an external source,<br>
wherein the receiving module performs demodulating and decoding<br>
on the wireless signals being delivered from the antenna, and wherein<br>
the transmitting module performs modulating and encoding on the data<br>
being delivered from the processor, and<br>
wherein the processor controls a bandwidth request preamble<br>
sequence (BR preamble sequence) and a quick access message to be<br>
transmitted to a base station through the transmitting module,<br>
controls uplink grant (UL grant) information corresponding to<br>
information included the quick access message to be received from the<br>
base station through the receving module, and controls data to be<br>
transmitted to the base station by using an uplink resource indicated<br>
by the uplink grant information, and<br>
wherein the quick access message comprises a mobile station<br>
identifier for identifying (or addressing) the mobile station and<br>
information representing quality of service (QoS) level and a size of<br>
the requested bandwidth.<br>
15. The mobile station of claim 14, wherein the controller<br>
controls allocation information of bandwidth request channels<br>
corresponding to an uplink resource for transmitting the BR preamble<br>
sequence to be received from the base station through a predetermined<br>
broadcast channel,<br>
wherein the BR preamble sequence and the quick access message<br>
are transmitted through randomly selected one of the bandwidth<br>
request channels.<br>
<br>
<br>
The present invention deals with a method for requesting and allocating<br>
an uplink resource efficiently in a broadband wireless access<br>
system. The method of the present invention wherein a terminal<br>
requests bandwidth in a broadband wireless access system may include<br>
a step in which a bandwidth request header (BR header), including<br>
a bandwidth request message and a high-speed access message, is<br>
transmitted to a base station; a step in which uplink grant (UL grant)<br>
information corresponding to the information included in said<br>
bandwidth request message and said high-speed access message is<br>
received from said base station; and a step in which the uplink resource<br>
indicated by said uplink grant information is used to transmit data<br>
to said base station.</td>
