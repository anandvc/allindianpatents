COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and process for treatment of effluents. More particularly the present invention relates to an apparatus and process for the electrochemical treatment of effluents.<br>
Background and Prior art<br>
Electrochemical treatment plays a significant role in the effluent treatment technology for the removal of many of the pollutants either completely or converting them to less toxic materials. Since these types of treatments do not add to the mineralisation of water nor do they result in the secondary pollution, the reuse of the treated water plays a very important role in an industry that requires a large quantity of water. The Electrochemical methods are based on the electrochemical reactions such as anodic oxidation, anodic dissolution that forms the precipitates, O2 &amp; H2 evolution at anode and cathode, electrodeposition, electro osmosis, etc. Depending on the nature of the pollutant, with due consideration for the toxicity of the reactions and products, appropriate choice of the method has to be made. The choice of the method of the treatment depends on the nature and the quantity of the pollutants. The pollution of any water or wastewater is determined in terms of color, odor, turbidity, pH, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Total Organic Content, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Suspended Solids, metals, oils and greases, microorganisms, etc. It may be necessary to adopt more than one method in order to achieve satisfactory results. Electrooxidation, Electro reduction, Electro deposition, Electroflotation, Electrocoagulation, Electroflocculation, Electro dialysis, Electro osmosis are some of the Electrochemical methods.<br>
In the prior art, devices for effluent treatment are based on the electrochemical treatment of wastewater. In particular, those based on the treatment of effluent are by electro flotation, electro coagulation and electro flocculation methods, due to their high performance  capabilities.   These  methods  are  accomplished  either  in  batches  or<br>
2<br><br>
continuously. These methods of electrochemical treatment of effluent have been tried for many years, but have not been made to work satisfactorily.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,872,959 to Herbst et al describes a tubular system in which the water passes between inner, outer and central electrodes, and is designed to add flocculating ions to settle the pollutants to the bottom of the settling tank into which the water will be passed. It uses iron and aluminium anodes, though suggests other metals as well, for example copper cathode, iron anode. It is not very successful because the electrodes have a tendency to clog. Further, the system is designed for specific conductivities of the water, and controlling the dose of coagulating ions required for a particular reaction is not easy.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,690 to Gardner-Clayson et al acknowledges that replacement of electrodes is a big problem and uses metallic, preferably aluminium, steel (alloy) or magnesium as method of overcoming the problem. The patent discloses the use of a layer of metal balls, shot, irregular shaped particles to be consumable, instead of sheet. Current is passed from metal anode to these balls etc., which then pass cations into the water and the process repeats itself. The drawback of this system is that large voltages are required to drive the electric current between the anode and cathode. Also there is no guarantee that the metal particles in this shape are well suited for the passage of an electric current. Also, it does not address the problems of variations in electrical conductivity of the water.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,755 to Gardner-Clayson et al is a continuation application of US 5372690 and discusses an apparatus that includes a fluidized bed of metallic particles through which the medium is flowed and through which an electric current is applied by electrodes for agglomerating contaminants in the medium. In order to allow the electrodes to be non-consumable so that they do not require frequent replacement, the particles are consumable.<br>
In JP52-14397, published Nov 30, 1977, the electrocoagulation chamber serves only to produce coagulants, for which purpose a pure electrolyte is fed there into, while<br>
3<br><br>
liquid purification is accomplished in another chamber where into the wastewater being purified is fed and where the wastewater is mixed with the electrolyte containing coagulants and fed from the electrocoagulation chamber.<br>
USSR Cert. No. 407844 comprises a settling chamber which houses an electrocoagulation chamber and communicates with the latter. The electrocoagulation chamber has soluble electrodes and an inlet pipe to feed wastewater disposed under the electrodes. The settling chamber comprises an outlet pipe to discharge the treated water. The wastewater is mixed with HC1; NaCl when it passes between the electrodes and current is applied. This brings about the formation of hydroxides of soluble electrode metal, which coagulates the impurities contained in the wastewater. The coagulated liquid passes into the settling chamber where the sludge separates from the liquid, following which sludge and the liquid are discharged separately. At the same time this process accelerates passivation of the electrodes and hence increases the power consumption and requires frequent cleaning of the electrodes, thus reduces the efficiency of the process.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,293,400 to Liggett and U. S. Patent No. 4,872,959 to Herbst, et al disclose a device utilizing electrodes in the form of metal tubes or pipes but require great effort in repairing or replacing the tubes. This amount of down time is unacceptable for many commercial applications.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,043,050 to Herbst discloses flat electrodes used within a coagulation chamber; however, in order for the apparatus of this invention to be used, the edges of the coagulation chamber must be tightly sealed. After long periods of use, the seals are difficult to maintain.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 3,925,176 to Okert discloses the use of a plurality of electrode plates for electrolytic treatment of liquids. However, these plates are not intended to be removed either as a whole or individually.<br>
4<br><br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,302,273 to Kemmerer discloses an ionic reaction device including a tubular housing with multiple circular electrode plates for the treatment of a fluid. Because of the torturous path utilized in the reaction chamber of this device, high pressures are required to move the liquid through the device, and the device appears susceptible to clogging and excessive gas buildup.<br>
PCT/US99/04312 discloses an electrocoagulation treatment device, which includes a plurality of spaced reaction plates, disposed within a reaction chamber.<br>
Drawbacks of the existing system<br>
•	The electrodes continually clog up, long before the metal plate has been adequately sacrificed into solution, which causes the high electrode replacement cost, making the process uneconomic.<br>
•	Variation in the feed quality results in difficulty in the process control.<br>
•	Commeicial viability is difficult.<br>
•	The impermeable oxide film may be formed on the cathode leading to the loss of the efficiency of the process.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
According to the present invention the apparatus and process for electrochemical treatment of wastewater comprises an Equalization Tank (ET), Electrochemical Reactor (ECR), Flash mixer (FM), Flocculent preparation Tank (FPT), Clarifier (CLR), Sludge conditioning tank (SCT) and sludge dewatering system (SDS).<br>
According to the present invention the Equalization tank may be made up of concrete, steel or mild steel. The inner side of the tank is provided with a rubber lining or Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) coating to prevent groundwater contamination. The tank is provided with drainage facility. Diffused air aeration or agitators are used to prevent septicity. The effluent is transferred from the equalization tank into the electrochemical reactor by a centrifugal or dosing pump. A flow-measuring device is provided to monitor the flow. Instrumentation is provided to control the level of the effluent in the Equalization tank.<br>
6<br><br>
According to the present invention the electrochemical reaction tank is made up of fiber reinforced composite without any metallic stiffeners/framework. The Fiber-reinforced composite tank is fully capable of resisting loads due to self- weight of electrode assembly, electrical assembly, hydrostatic pressure of influent etc. The tank is supported only at the base. The tank may alternatively be made of mild steel, stainless steel, concrete or other suitable material with rubber or FRP lining on the inner side. The inlet of the tank is at the lower end along the length or width of the reactor, outlet is at the upper end along the length or width of the reactor and drain at the lower end along the length or width of said reactor. A skimmer for full width of the tank is fitted on motorized stainless steel shaft that revolves at low speed.<br>
According to the present invention, the Electrochemical reaction chamber comprises a number of electrode plates that are arranged vertically and are spaced apart by a distance based on type of the effluent, application and the desired process reaction. The distance between the electrodes varies between 1 mm to 1000 mm. Continuous PVC blocks are placed between two adjacent plates to insulate them from each other. The reactor of the present invention comprises at least two electrode plates. The number of electrode plates depends on the reaction time, which is based on type of the effluent being treated, designed capacity and targeted quality of the output. The electrode assembly should not touch the tank. Alternate electrode plates are supported at either end on the top of the vertical walls of the FRP tank with the help of lugs. These lugs serve as electrical connections to the electrodes. The other electrodes are directly supported at the base of the FRP tank. A continuous PVC block with holes is positioned along the lower end of the first electrode for the effluent feed. Other continuous blocks are placed along the height between two adjacent plates, which insulates them from each other.<br>
Further, the electrode arrangement in the reactor is distinguished by the method of effluent feed. In a parallel flow system the effluent feed is divided and the effluent rises evenly in each electrode gap. While in series flow system, the effluent passes through each electrode gap.<br>
7<br><br>
According to the present invention the electrode plates are preferably rectangular in shape having sufficient thickness to withstand the pressure and to ensure the strength and life of the electrode plate for the designed period of operation, however, the electrodes maybe of any shape. The preferable length to width ratio of the electrode is between 1:1 to 1:3. The electrical connections are provided along the width of the electrodes, along the height of the reactor and at outer side of the reactor in order to protect the reactor from direct contact with effluent. The electrodes plates are preferably made of Aluminum or iron, however alternatively Titanium, Stainless steel, or Zinc electrodes may be used.<br>
Further, the capacity of the reactor may be increased by increasing the number of electrodes within the same reactor that increases the surface area of the electrodes in contact with the effluent stream and decreases the gap between the electrodes, which finally reduces the reaction time. In this case, the active reaction volume of the reactor remains unchanged.<br>
Further the capacity of the reactor maybe increased by increasing the size of the reactor itself keeping the gap between the electrode plates same and increasing the number of electrode plates which increases the active reaction volume of the reactor.<br>
The electrical connections of the plates are isolated from moisture ac^ effluent.. Further, a top cover is provided to isolate the chamber for safety purposes. The electrochemical chamber may be manufactured as a large industrial unit, a portable unit or a unit adapted for use within the home. The voltage and amperage of the electrical field within the reaction chamber may be adjusted as necessary. The reaction plates can be easily removed from the reaction chamber and may be replaced individually or as a ' set.<br>
According to the present invention DC Power is applied to electrode plates. The electrodes are connected in monopolar configuration. The electrodes are connected in parallel and therefore have the same potential difference across each anode-cathode pair.<br>
8<br><br>
Each anode-cathode pair consumes its own current; hence this configuration requires a low voltage source, but high current. The electrode connected in bipolar configuration can also be used. The applied voltage must be minimized by decreasing the Interelectrode gap whenever possible, increasing the electrical conductivity of the effluent, minimizing junction potential drops, selecting appropriate counter electrode reactions and using pure electrode material. Good potential and current distribution is achieved by effective electrode design and electrode arrangement. Heat generation due to the reaction itself, because of ohmic drops is also minimized by proper design of reactor.<br>
According to the present invention the DC Power unit consists of:<br>
1.	The AIR COOLED LINE CONTROLLER PANEL including the Incoming Circuit Breaker for isolation of Power to the Rectifier unit, Thyristor AC controller for automatic regulation of the voltage fed to the Transformer Rectifier, together with a set of front panel controls for setting current, Forward / Reverse duration and reversal time. Auto / Manual switch, Digital meters for indicating DC currents / voltages, and all relevant indications &amp; operator controls are provided on the front panel of the Controller. The Controller Panel is suitable for indoor installation and is provided with channels for mounting.<br>
2.	TRANSFORMER - RECTIFIER: A DC side electromechanical switch is provided for Periodic Reversal of the Rectifier. The Rectifier output connection busbars are available at the top of the enclosure. The Transformer - Rectifier enclosure is provided with wheels for mobility, and is suitable for outdoor mounting, in close proximity to the Effluent Treatment Tank.<br>
The DC currents in the Forward and Reverse polarities are settable by means of independent 10 turn potentiometers, with vernier dials on the Panel front.<br>
Once the current level is set, the Equipment automatically maintains it constant within 1%, regardless of variations in electrical supply and load conductivity.<br>
The DC Voltage &amp; DC Current is displayed by means of Digital or Analog Meters.<br>
9<br><br>
According to the present invention the Flash mixer is closed cylindrical Mild steel with rubber or FRP lining or stainless steel tank provided with a high-speed agitator (speed 80-120 rpm). The inlet for the effluent feed to the flash mixer is at the bottom and outlet is at the top of the flash mixer. Further, Drainage is provided at the bottom of the flash mixer. The effluent holding capacity of the flash mixer depends on the type of the effluent and time required to mix the polyelectrolyte with the electro-coagulated effluent properly to form floes from the finely electro-coagulated matter. The preferable effluent holding time of the flash mixer is 30 seconds.<br>
Flocculent preparation Tank according to the present invention is a cylindrical or rectangular tank provided with a low-speed agitator (speed 30-60 rpm). The flocculent solution preparation tank may be made up of mild steel or stainless steel having a rubber or FRP lining. The storage capacity of the flocculent preparation tank is dependent on the quantity of the flocculent solution required for 8-10 hrs.<br>
According to the present invention, the clarifier has a center-feed within a cylindrical tank made up of mild steel with rubber or FRP lining on the inner side. The effluent is carried to the center of the clarifier tank by gravity in a pipe from the flocculation chamber. At the center of the tank, the effluent enters in a circular well, which distributes the flow equally in all the direction. The center well has diameter preferably 15-20% of the diameter of the clarifier tank. The capacity of the clarifier depends on the nature and flow of the effluent.<br>
According to the present invention, the sludge-conditioning tank is a cylindrical open tank provided with low speed agitation made up of mild steel or stainless steel with rubber or FRP lining. The inlet is at the lower end of the tank and outlet is at the top end of the tank. A flocculent solution dosing is provided to the tank.<br>
The sludge dewatering system according to the present invention is a Belt filter press. It is a continuous feed sludge-dewatering device, which involves application of gravity drainage and mechanically applied pressure to dewater sludge. Following gravity<br>
10<br><br>
drainage, the sludge is squeezed between opposing porous cloth belts that passes through series of rollers releases additional water from the sludge.<br>
PROCESS DESCRIPTION<br>
-According to the process of the present invention, the effluent feed to the electrochemical reactor is prepared in the equalization tank to achieve better treatment efficiency of the Electrochemical treatment. The possibility of electrically charged particles adhering to the surface of the electrodes is more likely to occur if the effluent is at an extreme pH. This is overcome by maintaining the pH of the effluent to be close to 7.<br>
According to the present invention, the equalization of the quality and quantity of the effluent feed is done to prevent shock loads to the subsequent treatment units. Further, the equalization includes expulsion of any volatile matter that is present and the neutralization of the effluent if necessary, by addition of an acid or alkali, to maintain the pH of the effluent feed preferably in the range of 6.8-7.2, which is required for the subsequent treatment.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, the treated effluent feed from the equalization tank is passed to the electrochemical reactor through the inlet at the lower end along the length or width of the reactor. In the electrochemical reactor chamber it is passed through the electrode plates. For a continuous mode of operation appreciable flow of effluent is required preferably 0.01 to 100 cubic meters per hour. The electrode arrangement in the reactor is distinguished by the method of effluent feed into parallel flow or series flow system.<br>
In the parallel flow system the effluent feed is divided and the effluent rises evenly in each electrode gap. This type of flow is necessary for low values of Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Dissolved Solids, etc or if the effluent is gaseous.<br>
11<br><br>
According to the present invention, for a given effluent feed and electrode area the total current possible from a series flow system is greater than that of parallel flow system. This type of flow is necessary for high values of Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Dissolved Solids, etc. which requires more reaction time. In the series flow system; the effluent passes through each electrode gap.<br>
This system causes the sacrificial electrode ions to move into the effluent. The metal ions react with hydroxyl ions and form metal hydroxide (coagulant), which adsorb on the colloidal particles, other ions and emulsions. Due to the continuous flow of the effluent the metal hydroxide precipitate is carried out to flash mixer. The oxygen gas produced at the anode also oxidises the pollutants present in the effluent. At the same time, the hydrogen gas is evolved on the cathode surface. The generation of fine hydrogen gas bubbles over the whole area of the cathode, adsorb on the suspended particles and moves vertically towards the surface. At the surface a layer of foam is created which is removed by continuous skimmer fitted on motorized stainless steel shaft for full width of the tank that revolves at low speed. Alternatively, foam can be removed by applying a vacuum.<br>
In the present invention, the polarity of the electrode plates is automatically reversed on a periodic basis. Reversing of the polarity causes the material attracted to one polarity to be driven off by repelling the material, which was attracted. This action reduces the build up of electrically deposited material, maintains clean electrode surface and also equalizes the electrode sacrificial rate.<br>
Turbulence helps easy evolution of hydrogen gas at cathode and thus prevents the formation of nonconductive hydrogen layer. Also turbulence prevents metal hydroxides, deposition on the cathode and thus prevents cathode passivation. In the present invention turbulence of the liquid stream is increased either by maintaining the Reynolds number of the effluent stream more than 2000 or by injecting the air into the effluent stream from the bottom of the Reactor. Turbulence increases the efficiency of the electrolytic process..._.<br>
12<br><br>
The Electrochemical treatment of the effluent is dependent on the amount of the current (amperage). The current is passed through the effluent between cathode and anode. The amount of the current required depends on the type of the effluent being treated. To reduce the power consumption without changing the current and the degree of the separation, the resistance in the electrolyte can be reduced. Reducing the distance between the electrodes or increasing the conductivity of the electrolyte will reduce the power consumption without changing the degree of separation.<br>
According to the process of the present invention the electro-coagulated effluent from the electrochemical reactor chamber is carried to the flocculation chamber by gravity where an effective quantity of flocculent solution such as a polyelectrolyte is rapidly mixed by means of flash mixer. The polyelectrolyte added may be cationic, anionic or nonionic depending on the nature of the effluent. According to the present invention the preferable mixing time is about 30 seconds.<br>
Further, as per the process of the invention the flocculated effluent is carried to the center of the clarifier tank by gravity in a pipe from the flocculation chamber. At the center of the tank, the effluent enters in a circular well, which distributes the flow equally in all the directions. The flocculated effluent is allowed to gravity settle in the clarifier, the floes being higher in weight settle at the bottom of the clarifier leaving clear water (supernatant) at the top. The slurry containing most of the solids is removed as sludge through a drain at the bottom of the clarifier. Since the floes settle very fast at the bottom of the clarifier, the effluent holding capacity of the clarifier is reduced.<br>
Further, the slurry is taken from the bottom of the clarifier, flocculated by application of small quantity of polyelectrolyte in a sludge-conditioning tank and introduced on a gravity drainage section of belt press where it is allowed to thicken. In this section majority of free water is removed from the sludge by gravity. Following gravity drainage, the sludge is squeezed between opposing porous cloth belts, which passes through series of rollers releases additional water from the sludge.<br>
13<br><br>
The final dewatered sludge cake that comes out from the belt press contains approximately 30-35% solids.<br>
According to the present invention, the cleaning of the reactor is done in a closed system. Electrode clogging is a major problem that occurs during the electrochemical treatment of the effluent that prevents the proper functioning of the reactor. Clogging of the electrode occurs because the electrically charged particles adhere to the electrodes or an insulating oxide layer is formed on the surface of the electrode.<br>
In the present invention, the automatic polarity reversal of the electrodes on a periodic basis and turbulence in the effluent feed maintain the electrode surface clean for a long duration. To increase the life of the electrodes it is necessary to clean the electrodes chemically and mechanically after the efficiency of the reactor decreases by 10-15 %. The chemical cleaning is done by circulation of cleaning solution such as a diluted acid and keeping it in a reactor for a specified time and drained back to the chemical cleaning solution storage tank. The metal oxides &amp; hydroxides and other pollutant deposited on the electrode plates either get dissolved in the cleaning solution or are removed from the electrode plates.<br>
The apparatus and process of the present invention maybe used in the electrochemical treatment of effluents from varied industries such as distilleries, dairy, sewage, paper mill effluents, etc.<br>

The flocculent solution is prepared in the flocculent preparation tank (16) having a flocculent inlet (17) through which the flocculent in powder or liquid form is introduced into the flocculent preparation tank (16) and a water inlet (18) through which water is introduced and mixed together by slow speed agitator (19). The flocculent is carried to the flash mixer (14) through a dosing pump (20) and mixed together by high-speed agitator (21). The electro-coagulated flocculated effluent is transferred from the flash mixer (14) to a clarifier (22), having inlet (23) a well structure (24) and an outlet (25), where it is allowed to settle by gravity. Clear water is removed from the outlet (25) at the top of the clarifier to discharge or recycling and slurry is transferred from another outlet (26) at the bottom of the clarifier to a sludge-conditioning tank (27) having a flocculent inlet (28) for addition of flocculent<br>

solution. The flocculent inlet (28) is connected to the dosing pump (20). The flocculent solution is mixed together with slurry by low speed agitator (30). The sludge is transferred from outlet (31) the sludge-conditioning tank (27) to a sludge dewatering system - belt filter press (32) where it gets dewatered to thick sludge (33) and the filtrate (34) to discharge or reuse. The reactor is cleaned periodically. The cleaning solution storage tank (35) has an inlet (37) for addition of cleaning chemical and inlet (38) for addition of water. The cleaning chemical and water is mixed together in suitable proportion and stored in cleaning solution storage tank (35). The chemical cleaning is done by circulation of cleaning solution through the feed pump (06) from the outlet (36) of cleaning solution storage tank (35) and drained back at inlet (39) to the cleaning solution storage tank (35) after keeping it in a reactor for a specified time.<br>
Figure 2 is section of FRP reactor tank used in the effluent treatment system wherein electrodes assembly (9) is fitted in the reactor. Effluent feed Inlet (07) and drain (39) is at the lower end of the reactor. A skimmer (41) for full width of the tank is fitted on motorized Stainless Steel shaft that revolves at low speed and removes foam generated in the reactor which is collected in a foam collection chamber. The top cover (10) is provided to isolate the chamber for safety purposes. The outlet is taken from outlet PVC nozzle (13).<br>
Figure 3 is a section at center of Electrode Assembly that is used practically for the effluent treatment in series flow. The rectangular electrode plates (09) of thickness (42) spaced by a typical distance (43) are arranged vertically in the reactor. Alternate electrode plates are supported at either end on the top of the vertical walls of the FRP tank by way of lugs (45) and other electrode plates are directly supported at the base of the FRP tank. The continuous PVC block (44) with holes along the lower end of the first electrode is provided for the effluent feed. The continuous PVC block along the height between two adjacent plates insulates them from each other. The lugs (45) and (46) are provided for the electrical connections to the electrodes. The electrochemical reactor has inlet (07) for effluent feed at the lower end, outlet (13) at the top end and drain (39) at the lower end of the said reactor.<br>
