The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
23-9-2004<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a composition for use in a dishwashing machine.  More particularly, the invention is directed to a superior dishwashing composition that has a polymer comprising a positive charge and a water soluble polymer that reduces phosphate scale formation.  The dishwashing composition unexpectedly results in excellent cleaning properties and excellent glass appearance when used to clean glassware even in the presence of hard water and in the absence of conventional rinse aid compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dishwashing compositions constitute a generally recognized distinct class of detergent compositions, particularly when compared to detergents designed for fabric washing. „ For example.,, the. ultimate dishwashing composition results in a spotless and film-free appearance on glassware and silverware after a cleaning cycle in a dishwashing machine.  In fabric washing operations, on the otherhand, detergenr compositions which result in greasy, oily or soapy residues on items that were cleaned can be tolerated.<br>
Often, washing articles in a commercially available dishwashing machine entails using three products.  Salt is added to the salt compartment to recharge the ion exchanger<br><br>
which softens the water, a dishwashing formulation is used to clean the. articles and a rinse aid is used to ensure tha the articles are rinsed with no streaks or smears. Consumers generally find it very inconvenient, however, to replace or refill such products.<br>
In order to provide convenient products to consumers, manufacturers have been making dishwashing tablets in order to eliminate detergent handling and dosing issues.  Such tablets often have a detergent portion, and a wax portion which contains a rinse aid.  These types of tablets, which are sometimes referred to as 2-in-l tablets, have disadvantages since they may only be used in a wash cycle that does not exceed 55°C.  This is true because the wax portion which contains the rinse aid will completely dissolve in a wash cycle that exceeds 55°C.  This causes al of the rinse aid to drain out of the dishwashing machine before the actual rinse cycle.  Furthermore, such 2-in-l tablets require that salt be added to the dishwashing machine in order to obtain optimal results, and they are very complicated and expensive to produce.<br>
Other types of tablets that are, well known are often referred to as pH sensitive 2-in-l tablets .  These types of tablets have a detergent portion and rinse aid portion that is contained in a pH sensitive material.  The pH sensitive 2-in-l tablets may be used in wash cycles that exceed 55°C However, like the detergent tablets with the wax portion, the pH sensitive 2-in-l tablets require that salt be added to the dishwashing machine in order to obtain optimal<br><br><br>
cleaning results and they are extremely expensive to produce-.<br>
In view of the vast deficiencies of the conventional products, it is of increasing interest to provide a dishwashing composition, such as a dishwashing tablet, that works well at all wash temperatures of a dishwashing system (even temperatures greater than 55°C), provides antiscaling benefits in a system that is high in phosphate content (in hard water), does result in excellent cleaning benefits in water that has not been subjected to conventional water softening additives (i.e., hard water) and provides a glossy glassware appearance in the absence of conventional rinse aid compositions.  This invention, therefore, is directed to a dishwashing composition that has a polymer comprising a positive charge and a water soluble polymer that reduces phosphate scale formation on glassware being cleaned.  The dishwashing composition is superior in that it unexpectedly results in excellent cleaning properties, and reduced spotting and scale formation even when no salt is added to the dishwashing machine to soften hard water, when washing cycles exceed a temperature of 550C,   and" when no rinse aid composition is. added to the dishwashing machine.  In fact, the present invention is directed to a superior 3-in-l detergent composition that is inexpensive to produce, and very easy for the consumer to use.<br><br><br>
Background Material<br>
Efforts have been made to prepare dishwashing compositions.  In U.S. Patent No. 5,939,373, an automatic dishwashing detergent composition comprising a phosphate builder and a metal containing bleach catalyst is described.<br>
Still other efforts have been disclosed for making dishwashing compositions.  In WO 00/06688, a dishwashing composition with a coated core is described.  The coated core has a substance that exerts function in a clear rinse cycle.<br>
Even further, other efforts have been disclosed for making dishwashing compositions.  In DE 197 27 073 Al, coated detergent components are described.<br>
None of the material above describes a dishwashing composition that has a polymer with a positive charge and a water soluble polymer that reduces phosphate, scale formation wherein the dishwashing composition results in excellent cleaning properties and glass appearance when used, for example, in the presence of hard water, in the absence of rinse aid compositions and even in a washing cycle that exceeds a temperature of 55°C.<br><br><br>

There is no limitation with respect to the amount of polymer with a positive charge that may be used in this invention other than that the amount used results in a dishwashing composition.  Typically, however, from about 0.1<br><br><br>
to about 10.0, and preferably, from about 0.2 to about 7.0, and -most'preferably, from about 0.3 to about 5.0% by wt. of the dishwashing composition is a polymer comprising a positive charge, based on total weight of the dishwashing composition, including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
In general, the polymers comprising the positive charge which may be used in this invention are typically made commercially available from suppliers like Nalco and Rohm &amp; Haas.  The monomers used to make the polymers having a positive charge may be provided by suppliers like Aldrich and Sigma.  Such polymers may also ba prepared via conventional reactions which include free radical polymerizations.<br>
As to the water soluble polymer that reduces phosphate scale formation, such a polymer often comprises at least one structural unit derived from a monomer having the formula:<br><br>
■wherein R1 is a group comprising at least one sp2 bond, Z is 0, N, P, S, or an amido or ester link, A is a mono- or a<br><br><br>

It is further noted herein that it is within the scope of this invention for all the polymers used to be a homopolymer or copolymer, including terpolymers. Furthermore, the polymers of this invention may be terminated with conventional termination groups resulting from precursor monomers and/or initiators that are used.<br>
There is generally no limitation with respect to how much water soluble polymer that reduces phosphate scale formation is used in this invention as long as the amount used results in a dishwashing composition.  Often, from about 0.5 to about 10.0, and preferably, from about 1.0  to 7.0, and most preferably, from about 1.5 to about 4.5% by weight water soluble polymer is used, based on total weight<br><br>
of the dishwashing composition, including all ranges subsumed therein.  These water soluble polymers typically have a weight average molecular weight from about 1,000 to about 50,000.<br>
Phosphate containing builders are a preferred additive in this invention.  Such builders typically make up from about 5.0 to about 75.0% by weight of the total weight of the dishwashing composition, including all ranges subsumed therein.  Preferably, however, the amount of phosphate containing builder employed is from about 10.0 to about 70.0, and most preferably, from about 15.0 to about 65.0% by weight based on total weight of the dishwashing composition and including all ranges subsumed therein.  The phosphate containing builders which may be used in this invention are well known, for example, for binding metals such as Ca and Mg ions, both of which are often abundant in hard water found in dishwashing machines.  An illustrative list of the phosphate builders which may be used in this invention include sodium, potassium and ammonium pyrophosphate; alkali metal tripolyphosphates, sodium and potassium orthophosphate and sodium polymetaphosphate, with sodium tripolyphosphate being especially preferred.<br>
Other additives which may be used in this invention include well known items such as perfumes, antifoaming agents, anti-tarnish agents, disintegrants, and processing aids (e.g., polyethylene glycol) which aid in forming tablet-type dishwashing compositions.  Such additives, collectively, do not normally make up more than about 8.0%<br><br><br>
by.weight of the total weight of the dishwashing composition.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention to use conventional dishwashing bleaches and activators (e.g., from about 0.02 wt. % to about 20.0 wt. % based on total weight of the dishwashing composition).  Such bleaches include inorganic and organic peracids as well as salts thereof. Examples include epsilon phthalimido perhexanoic acid and Oxone®, respectively.<br>
Other bleaches which may be used in this invention include hydrogen peroxide and its precursors (e.g., sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate).<br>
If desired, conventional bleach activators (including catalysts) may be used with the bleaches described herein. These activators include N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetraacetylethylenediamine, nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate cationic nitriles, cholyl(4-sulfophenyl) carbonate, and quaternary imine. salts (e.g.,.. N-methyl-3,4-dihydrooisoquinolinium p-toluenesulfonate).<br>
Other bleach activators which may be used include transition metal-containing bleach catalysts such as [MnIV 2(M-0)3(Me3TACN)2] (PF6)2 (as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,728,455, 5,114,606, 5,153,161, 5,194,416, 5,227,084, 5,244,594, 5,246,612, 5,246,621, 5,256,779, 5,274,147, 5,280,117), [Fe11 (MeN4py) (MeCN) ] (CIO4)2 (as described in EP 0 909 809) and [Co111 (NH3) 5 (OAc) J (OAc) 2 (as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,559,261, WO 96/23859, WO 96/23860, WO<br><br><br>
96/23861T/" the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention to employ conventional dishwashing enzymes and buffers.  The former typically make up from about 0.5 to about 10.0% hy  weight of the total weight of the dishwashing composition and include proteases like Savinase®, Purafect Ox® and Properase® and amylases like Termamyl®, Purastar ST® and Purastar Ox Am®, all of which are commercially available.  The latter typically make up from about 5.0 to about 25.0% by weight of the total weight of the dishwashing composition and include well known buffers like sodium disilicate, sodium metasilicate and sodium carbonate.<br>
When washing glassware with the dishwashing composition of this invention, soiled glassware is typically placed in a conventional domestic or commercial dishwashing machine as is the dishwashing composition of this invention (in no particular order) .  The dishwashing composition, in the form of a liquid, powder or detergent tablet, preferably a tablet, then dissolves in the water of the dishwasher to wash the glassware.  The typical dishwashing cycle is from about 10 minutes until about 60 minutes and the typical temperature of the water in the dishwasher is from about 40°C to about 70°C.  The glassware resulting from the above-described cleaning method is clean and has an excellent glass appearance (i.e., substantially free of film and spots).  Such results are unexpectedly obtained even when hard water at high temperatures (greater than 55°C) is used, in the absence of rinse aid compositions.<br><br><br>
When marketing the superior dishwashing composition of this invention, it is preferred that the dishwashing composition is formed into a tablet and sold in a package with directions to add the dishwashing composition to the dishwashing machine as a 3-in-l product.  Thus, a dishwasher is charged with the dishwashing composition of this invention without having to add to the dishwasher conventional rinse aid compositions and sodium chloride.<br>

3 00 ppm. of total, hardness (Ca2+:Mg2+ = 4:1, expressed as CaC03) and 32 0 ppm of temporary hardness expressed as sodium carbonate (i.e. 300/320 ppm water hardness).  A typical dish-ware set for machine dishwasher tests included 8 clean drinking glasses (on the upper rack), 2 plastic containers, 6 tea cups, 1 melamine plate, 1 Teflon-coated frying pan and 16 clean plates to mimic the actual washing conditions.<br>
When a three-run build-up test was ready to be started, 18 g of base formulation (Table 2) was added in the dispenser cup of the dishwasher.  In addition, 0.27 g of cationic polymer (Merquat Plus 3331) and 0.54 g of antisealant (Table 3) were dosed via the dispenser cup or added directly into the machine at the dispenser cup opening at the beginning of the main wash.  Forty grams of A3TM standard food soil, described in Section 5.2 of ASTM Method D 3556-85, "Standard Test Method for Deposition on Glassware During mechanical Dishwashing" was spread on the dishwasher door prior to the beginning of each run.  This soil consists of 80' % margarine and 20 % low fat powdered milk.<br>
The same,.dishware set. was. put- through, three - consecutive cycles with the same detergent formulation and soil load. At the end of each machine run, drinking glasses were removed and graded inside a viewing cabinet according to extent of spotting and filming.  Both spotting and filming scores were recorded based on area covered by and intensity of spots and film, respectively.  Spotting scores are expressed on a 0 to 4 scale and filming scores  are recorded on a 0 to 5 scale, 0 being completely free of spots or film. The sum of spotting and filming score indicates the overall glass appearance, i.e. the higher the total score meaning a<br><br><br>
poorer final glass appearance.  Results are recorded in Table 3.<br>

As shown in Table 3, phosphate antiscaling polymers greatly enhance glass appearance in the presence of a cationic polymer under hard water washing conditions (Tests No. 2 and 3) .  Conventional dispersing polymers, such as polycarboxylate polymers, in fact, cause an increase of spots on glassware; as such, giving worsened glass<br><br><br>
appearance   (Test  No.   4) .     Inclusion of  a phosphonate de¬scaling seguestrant   (e.g.   K3DP)   does not provide any benefit on enhancing overall  glass appearance   (Test No.   5).<br>
Example  2<br>
Experiments were carried out in a Zanussi DWS 677 dishwasher, Economy 55°C program. Water used for the runs was adjusted to 300ppm permanent hardness with Ca:Mg=4:l and 320ppm of temporary hardness expressed as NaC03. Each experiment consisted of 3 consecutive machine runs where glass appearance data reported in the example is the result of the last run.<br>
Soils used in each run included:<br>
3 cerctmic plates coated with 2. Og egg yolk on each plate; 3 stainless steel plates coated with 2.Og each of egg yolk; 3 ceramic plates coated with 2.Og ea. of potato starch soil; 3 ceramic plates coated with 2.0g ea. of cream of wheat; 40g of ASTM butter-milk soil; 3 cups with 3x tea stain; 4 glasses with lipstick impression.<br>
5 clean glasses were placed onto the top rack of dishwasher and were kept there for all runs while above described soiled articles were replaced for each run.<br><br><br>
