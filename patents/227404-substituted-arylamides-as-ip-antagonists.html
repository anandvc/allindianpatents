This invention relates to prostaglandin I2 (IP) receptor antagonists, and associated pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods for their use as therapeutic agents.<br>
Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PG's) are a group of bioactive compounds derived from membrane phospholipids and are formed from 20-carbon essential fatty acids containing three, four, or five double bonds, and a cyclopentane ring. They fall into several main classes designated by the letters D, E, F, G, H, or I, and are distinguished by substitutions to the cyclopentane ring. The main classes are further subdivided by subscripts 1,2, or 3, which reflect their fatty acid precursors. Thus, PGI2 has a double ring structure, and the subscript 2 indicates that it is related to arachidonic acid,<br>
PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin) acts on platelets and blood vessels to inhibit aggregation and to cause vasodilation, and is thought to be important for vascular homeostasis. It has been suggested that PGI2 may contribute to the antithrombogenic properties of the intact vascular wall, PGI2 is also thought to be a physiological modulator of vascular tone that functions to oppose the actions of vasoconstrictors. The importance of these vascular actions is emphasized by the participation of PGI2 in the hypotension associated with septic shock. Although prostaglandins do not appear to have direct effects on vascular permeability, PGI2 markedly enhances edema formation and leukocyte infiltration by promoting blood flow in the inflamed region. Therefore, IP receptor antagonists may relieve hypotension related to septic shock, may reduce edema formation, and may prevent conditions associated with excessive bleeding such as, but not limited to, hemophilia and hemorrhaging,.<br>
Several in vivo analgesia studies in rodents suggest that PGI2 plays a major role in the induction of hyperalgesia. Likewise, in ritro studies provide substantial evidence to suggest that "PGl2-preferring" (IP) receptors act as important modulators of sensory neuron function [Bley et al, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 19(4):141-147 (1998)]. Since IP receptors in sensory neurons are coupled to activation of both adenylyl cyclase and phos-pholipase C, and hence, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, these receptors can exert powerful effects on ion channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release. Evidence of a prominent role for IP receptors in inflammatory pain has been ob-<br><br>
tained from recent studies in transgenic mice lacking the IP receptor [Murata et al., Nature 388:678-682 (1997)].<br>
In addition to being mediators of hyperalgesia, prostaglandins are known to be generated locally in the bladder in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle, injuries of the vesical mucosa, and nerve stimulation [Anderson, Pharmacological Reviews 45(3):253-308 (1993)]. PGI2 is the major prostaglandin released from the human bladder. There are suggestions that prostaglandins may be the link between detrusor muscle stretch produced by bladder filling and activation of C-fiber afferents by bladder distension. It has been proposed that prostaglandins may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder disorders. Therefore, antagonists of prostaglandin IP receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such conditions.<br>
Antagonists of IP receptors are also expected to find a utility in respiratory allergies wherein PGI2 production in response to an allergen is present or in respiratory conditions such as asthma.<br>
IP receptor antagonists, as well as a variety of other drugs, have come under increasing scrutiny with regard to cardiovascular side effects. Promising IP receptor antagonists have failed during clinical evaluation because of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly "torsade de points" (TdP), that can occur in clinical trial subjects. The mechanism by which these drugs lead to ventricular arrhythmias has been identified with modulation of the "human ether-a-go-go" or hERG ion channel. The hERG channel is a voltage-activated, inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, and is an important contributor to the repolarization of ventricular action potentials. Blockage of the hERG channel increases the duration of cardiac       ( action potentials, which leads to prolonged ventricular depolarization. Because of the potentially fatal nature of such hERG channel modulation, IP receptor antagonists that will ultimately be useful as drugs should cause minimal or no inhibition of the hERG channel.<br>
Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors is described in Goodman &amp; Gillman\ The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616.<br>

Acceptable protective groups for alcoholic or phenolic hydroxy! groups, which may be removed successively and selectively, include groups protected as acetates, haloalkyl carbonates, benzyl ethers, alkylsilyl ethers, heterocyclyl ethers, methyl or other alkyl ethers, and the like. Protective or blocking groups for carboxyl groups are similar to those described for hydroxyl groups, preferably fert-butyl, benzyl, or methyl esters. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene et aL, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 1999, J. Wiley, 2n ed., and Harrison et ah, Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, 1971-1996, Vols. 1-8, J. Wiley and Sons.<br>

Compounds of the present invention maybe made by the methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-20; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science'Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention may be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes may be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes may be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials maybe characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably take place at ' atmospheric pressure over a temperature range from about -7S°C to about 150°C&gt; more<br><br>
preferably from about 0°C to about 125°C&gt; and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.gn about 20°C.<br>
Schemes A and B describe alternative methods to generate the compounds of the invention. Scheme A illustrates a preferred procedure for preparation of compounds of the embodiment of formula II, wherein X is halo or other leaving group, and n, p, R2, Ra&gt; Rb and Rc are as described herein. The procedure of Scheme A is exemplary, and alternative synthetic routes to the compounds of the invention will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art<br><br>
SCHEME A<br>
In step 1 of Scheme A, an aminoalkyl arylamine a is reacted with an aroyl halide b, to afford an aryl amide compound c. Step 1 is a straightforward condensation reaction that provides quantitative or substantially quantitative yields under mild conditions using a variety of aminoalkyl arylamine such as 4-aminomethyl-phenylamine with various aroyl halides. The aroyl halide b is shown as an optionally substituted benzoyl halide. Numerous substituted benzoic acid compounds are commercially available, and the acid chloride compounds of such compounds may be used in this step. The aroyl halide b may alternatively comprise other types of aroyl halide, including naphthalene carbonyl halides such as naphthalene-1-carbonyl halide and naphthalene-2-carbonyl halide, which may optionally be substituted. In other embodiments of the invention aroyl halide b may be replaced with various heteroaroyl halides such as quinoline-5-carbonyl halide, quinoline-6-carbonyl halide, isoquinoline-5-carbonyl halide, isoquinoline-6-carbonyl halide, iso-nicotinoyl halide, pyrimidine-4-carbonyl halide, furan-3-carbonyl halide, thiophen-3-caxbonyl halide, and the like, which again may optionally be substituted. Also usable in<br><br>
place of aroyi halide b are substituted benzoic anhydrides and heteroaxomatic carboxylic anhydrides.<br>
The aryl amide compound c of step 1 may then, in step 2, be heated with 2-chloroimid-azoline sulfate under polar protic solvent conditions to provide an imidazolinylamino-substituted arylamide of formula II.<br>
Many variations on the procedure of Scheme A are possible. Where substituents R and/or R4 are incompatible with or otherwise sensitive to the chemistry of step 1 or step 2, suitable protecting group strategies may be utilized. Numerous well-known protecting group schemes maybe used in this regard. Exemplary protecting group strategies are described by, e.g., Greene et al. in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis-, 3rd. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999. In certain embodiments, although generally less preferred, chloroimidazoline may first be reacted with aminoalkyl aniline a, provided that the suitable protection of amino groups is made to prevent unwanted reaction. The resulting product can then be depro-tected or partially deprotected and reacted with aroyi halide b to yield imidazolinylamino-substituted arylamide II.<br>
Scheme B illustrates a preferred procedure for preparation of compounds of the embodiment of formula III, wherein n, p, R2, R\ R and Rc are as described herein.<br><br>
SCHEME B<br>
In step 1 of Scheme B, an aryl amine e is reacted with a nitroarylalkyl carboxyiic acid fin the presence of a carbodiimide such as EDC (l-(3-diine1iylajninopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodi-<br><br>
imide hydrochloride) to yield a nitro-substituted aryl amide compound g. The aryl amine e used in this step may comprise an optionally substituted phenylamine, many of which are commercially available, or an optionally substituted naphthalenylamine such as naph-thalen-1-ylamine or naphthalen-2-ylamine. Alternatively, the compound e may comprise an optionally substituted heteroaryi amine such as pyridin-4-ylamine, pyrimidin-5-yl-amine, quinolin-5-ylamine, quinolin-6-ylamine, isoquinolin-5-ylamine, isoquinolin-6-yl-amine, thiophen-3-ylamine, fiiran-3-ylamine, or the like.<br>
The nitro-substituted aryl amide g of step 1 is reduced in step 2 to provide an aminoaryl-allcyl carboxylic acid h. The reduction of step 2 maybe carried out using a platinum or palladium catalyst on activated carbon in the presence of hydrogen under mild conditions.<br>
The aminoarylalkyl carboxylic acid compound h of step 2 may then, in step 3, be heated with 2-chloroimidazoline sulfate under polar protic solvent conditions to provide an imid-azolinylamino-substituted aryl amide of formula HI.<br>
The procedure of Scheme B, like that of Scheme A, is only exemplary and many alternate procedures and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the nitro-substituted aryl amide compound g of step 1 maybe replaced by an aminoarylalkyl carboxylic acid compound wherein the amino group is protected. In this case, step 2 would involve deprotection to provide the free amino group instead of reduction of a nitro group. In another variation of the procedure of Scheme B, an amino-substituted aryl amide compound could first be reacted with chloroimidazoline, and the resulting product, using a suitable protection strategy, may then be reacted with aryl amine e to provide the aryl amide III.<br>

Example 4:      In vitro Human Platelet IP Receptor Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
The Assay of this example was used to measure the strength of a potential drug's binding affinity to its intended target<br>
For each drug tested, the concentration producing 50% inhibition of binding (IC50) and Hill slope was determined using iterative curve fitting techniques. If a radioligand Kd was known the inhibition dissociation constant (Ki) of each drug was determined according to the method of Cheng &amp; Prusoff (1973). For this receptor, a typical Kd, under the conditions of this example, was 1 E-8 M. Usually the negative logarithm of the Ki (pKO was presented..<br><br>
1.	Membrane Preparation<br>
250 mL Platelet Rich Plasma was transferred into 250 mL centrifuge tubes and spun at 6000g for 10 min at 20°C. Pellets were then resuspended in IP lysis buffer and homogenized using a polytron(setting 7,1x20 sec burst), brought up to a final volume of 180 mL and centrifiiged at 40,000g for 15 min at 4°C, The pellets were then resuspended in IP assay buffer, protein density determined by BCA method (Pierce) and stored in 2.0 mL vials at -80°C for subsequent assay use.<br>
To obtain at least 80 % specific binding, 50 j-tg protein/assay tube were used in a competition experiment The final radioligand concentration was 1 to 3E-8 M.<br>
2.	Competition Assay<br><br>
The membranes were thawed at room temperature and then diluted in assay buffer to the appropriate concentration.<br>
First buffer, drug, radioligand, and lastly, membranes were added to the assay tubes. The assay tubes were incubated at 25°C for 60 min. The assay tubes were filtered onto 0.3% PEI pre-treated glass fiber filtermats (GF/ B ) using Packard Top Count 96 well cell harvester. The tubes were rinsed three times with ice cold 20mM Tris-HCl, 5mM MgCl2&gt; pH=7.4 (3 x 0.5 mL/sample). Bound radioactivity was determined using liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention were found to have affinity for the IP receptor. For example, the compound 4-(2-chloro-fhiophen-3-yl)-N-[4-(4,5-di-hydro-lH-imidazol-2-ylamino)-benz)d]-benzamide exhibited a pKi value (10 \ig) of approximately 9.73.<br>
Example 5:      Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay<br>
The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention was determined by the Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw hyperalgesia in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Randall and Selitto [Archives of International Pharmacodynamics 11:409-419 (1957)], and Vinegar et al. [Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 166:96-103(1969)].<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n=10). To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and administered 1% carrageenan or vehicle 1 (100 pi) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Rats were administered vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.or 1 ml/kg, Lv) or compounds of this invention (at 1,3,10,30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or (0.3,1.0,3.0 and lOmg/kg, i.v.) one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The vehicle- or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw. The force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point<br>
Treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force (RESP). Pairwise comparisons for the drug-treated groups to the vehicle group were made using Fisher's LSD strategy and Dunn's procedure. Percent inhibition of<br><br>
mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated for each animal, and the average ID 50 value was estimated using the following sigmoidal model:<br>
% inhibition = 100 / (1 + exp ((ID50-dose) / N))<br>
where ID50 is the dose of the compound needed to inhibit half of the maximum response (z.e., 100% in this model) and N is a curvature parameter. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
Example 6:      Complete Freund's Adjuvant-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay<br>
The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention may also be determined using an adjuvant-induced arthritis pain model in the rat, where pain is assessed by the animal's response to the squeezing of the inflamed foot, using a modification of the method described in Hylden et al. [Pain 37:229-243 (1989)]. The modification includes the assessment of hyperalgesia instead of changes in activity of spinal cord neurons.<br>
Briefly&gt; rats were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and 100 ^1 of Complete Freund's Adjuvant or saline was administered into the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Twenty-four hours later, water (vehicle) or compounds of this invention were orally administered to the rats one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The saline or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw, and the force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. The treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force. Percent inhibition was calculated for each animal in the form:<br>
100 x ((c/d-c/v) -r (s/v - c/v))<br>
where c/d is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which drug has been administered; c/v is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered; and s/v is the paw withdrawal force for the saline-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been admini-<br><br>
stered. Significance was determined using Student's t-test The compounds of the invention were active in this assay.<br>
Example 7:     Inhibition of Bladder Contractions Induced by Isovolumetric Bladder Distension in Rats<br>
The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in Maggi et aL [J. Pharm. and Exper. Therapeutics 230:500-513 (1984)].<br>
Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. A catheter was inserted through the urethra into the bladder to induce bladder contractions, and a warm saline solution (5 mL) was infused. Rhythmic contractions were produced in about 30% of the animals. The compounds of the invention (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg) were administered intravenous at the onset of regular rhythmic contractions. The effects on rhythmic contracts were then measured. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
Example 8:     Inhibition of Volume-Induced Contractions in Rats<br>
The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in Hegde et aL, Proceedings of the 26th Annual Meeting of the Inter-national Continence Society (August 27th-30th&gt; 1996, Abstract 126.<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane and instrumented for intravenous administration of drugs and, in some cases, measurement of arterial pressure, heart rate and intra-bladder pressure. The effect of test compounds on volume-induced bladder contractions was determined in separate groups of animals. Volume-induced reflex bladder contractions were induced by filling the bladder with saline. The test compounds were administered intravenously in a cumulative manner at 10 minute intervals. Atropine (0.3 mg/kg, iv) was administered at the end of the study as a positive control. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
Example 9:     Reversal of Endotoxin-Induced Hypotension in Rats<br>
Septic shock, sometimes referred to as endotoxic shock, is caused by the presence of infectious agents, particularly bacterial endotoxins, in the bloodstream and is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction. Many symptoms of septic shock, in particular, hypo-<br><br>
tension, are induced in the rat by the administration of bacterial endotoxins. The ability of a compound to inhibit endotoxin-induced hypotension is therefore predictive of the utility of the compound in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock. The activity of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock was determined by measuring the reversal of endotoxin-induced hypotension in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Giral et al. [British Journal of Pharmacology 118:1223-1231 (1969)].<br>
Briefly, adult rats (&gt;200 g) were anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic and femoral arteries and veins were cannulated for insertion of blood pressure transducers and drug administration lines, respectively. They were placed in Mayo restrainers while still under the influence of the anesthetic. After recovery from anesthesia and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure (which typically required about 30 minutes), endotoxin (50 mg/kg E. coli and 25 mg/kg Salmonella) was administered intravenously. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. After one hour, compounds of this invention or vehicle were also administered intravenously, and cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored for the next three hours. Responses are represented as percentage return to initial diastolic blood pressure. Significance was determined using Student's t-test. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
Example 10:   hERG Potassium Channel Pharmacology Screening<br>
The effects of the subject compounds on recombinant hERG potassium channels expressed in CHO-K1 cells was determined according to the procedure reported by Hamill et al. [Pfliigers Arch. 391:85-100 (1981)].<br>
The following solutions were used to isolate potassium currents in cultured cell lines: extracellular (in mM), NaCl (150), KC1 (4), HEPES (10), CaCl2 (1.2), MgCl2 (1), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH; intracellular (in mM), KC1 (140), HEPES (10), EGTA (5), MgCl2 (6), ATP-Na2 (5), adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH.<br>
Whole-cell patch-clamp methods were used to record potassium currents from CHO.Kl cells expressing the human hERG channel. Each cell was held at a negative holding potential of -80 mV. At the beginning of each experiment, currents were characterized by obtaining current-voltage relationships. Cells were depolarized from -80 mV to 4-40 mV for 1 second followed by a 300 ms repolarization to potentials between -120 and +20 mV (in 20 mV increments). The stimulation frequency is 0.1 Hz. Peak tail current amplitudes at the different test potentials were measured to obtain the current-voltage relationship.<br><br>
A second protocol was used to investigate the effects of compounds on hERG currents. Cells were depolarized from -80 mV to -1-20 mV for 500 ms and then repolarized to -40 mV for 500 ms, followed by a 200 ms hyperpolarizing pulse to -120 mV. At the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse, the cells were returned to a holding potential of -80mV. Data points were collected at a frequency of 0.1Hz (1 stimulus every 10 seconds) using pClamp 8.0 software from Axon Instruments in Clampex mode. Drugs were applied once a stable baseline has been recorded for 5 min. Data are collected for 5 or 10 minute blocks. The number of stimuli and therefore blocks of data for a given drug concentration depends on how quickly the drug reaches equilibrium.<br>
If a compound had an effect on current amplitude, the reversibility of the effect was examined by returning the buffer to control solution. Compounds affecting the current were washed out and higher concentrations of the compound was applied to the same cells following full recovery.<br>
Voltage-dependent potassium currents were recorded from single cells at room temperature (20-22°C) using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Cells were voltage-clamped using a patch-clamp amplifier (e.g., Axopatch 200; Axon Instruments) which is controlled by computer via a Digidata 1200 Interface (Axon Instruments). The voltage-clamp protocols used in this Example were generated using PClamp software (version 7 or later; Axon Instruments)., Whole-cell currents were low-pass filtered (1-2 kHz, 4-pole Bessel), digitized (10 kHz) and stored on magnetic medium for off-line analysis using PClamp software, Microcal Origin, and Prism.<br>
The peak amplitude of outward currents are measured using Clampfit software to find peak amplitude. The peak amplitudes of tie inward tail currents evoked are fit using a single exponential function:<br>
f(t)=X M~t/T,)+c<br>
where A indicates the peak current, C is the plateau or anti-peak, and x is the time constant. The Chebyshev search method with a four point smoothing function was applied. Once the tail currents were fit and peak amplitudes measured, the effects of the compound were determined as a % change compared to the peak amplitudes of the control peaks. Statistics were calculated using Microcal Origin and Prism software, and results were reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean. A minimum of 3 cells/concentration of compound was required for testing of each compound.<br><br>
A compound, cisapride, known to inhibit hERG potassium channels, was used as a standard compound and a full concentration-response curve for cisapride was generated for comparison with the subject compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention did not significantly inhibit the hERG potassium channel using the above assay. Notably, the hERG outward current inhibition percentage for the representative compound N-[4-(4,5-dihydro-lH-imidazol-2-yl-ajn2ino)--benzyl]-4-meth-oxy-benzamide was 4.3 + 4.4% at 1 jiM, and 10.8 + 7.2% at 10 [iM.<br>
