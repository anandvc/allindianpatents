COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF FORMULATION FOR ENTERAL FORMULAS CONTAINING SIALIC ACID<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]   The present invention relates generally to infant's and children's nutritional formulas containing sialic acid and methods for manufacturing such formulas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]   Sialic acid is a naturally occurring component of human breast milk, where it is found associated with various oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. While human breast milk contains substantial amounts of sialic acid, most infant formulas contain less than 25% of the sialic acid found in colostrum. Moreover, 70% of the sialic acid in formulas is glycoprotein-bound, unlike human breast milk in which 75% of sialic acid is bound to oligosaccharides. See Heine, W., etal., Monatsschr Kinderheilkd 141:946-50 (1993), Wang, B„ etal., Am J Clin Nutr74:510-5 (2001), and Nakano, T., et al., Acta Paediatr Taiwan 42:11-17 (2001). Not surprisingly, the accumulation of sialic acid by breast-fed infants is generally higher than for formula-fed infants. See Wang, B., et al., J Pediatr 138:914-6 (2001). Evidence suggests that N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA, or sialic acid) is important in the development and function of the neonatal brain where it is a major component of gangliosides. See Carlson, S.E., Am J Clin Nutr 41:720-6 (1985), Morgan, B. and Winnick, M., J Nutr 110:416-24 (1980), Svennerholm, L, etal., Biochim Biophys Acta 1005:109-17 (1989), and Wang, B., et al., Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol 435-9 (1998). Therefore, infants fed commercial formulas may not be acquiring sufficient quantities of a nutrient important for early development. [0003]   Cow's milk-based formulas generally have low sialic acid content. In one study, the concentration of sialic acid in several casein/whey combination formulas was less than 200 mg sialic acid/L. Moreover, soy protein-based formulas contain substantially reduced levels of sialic acid<br>
V*<br><br>
as compared to cow's milk-based formula. Therefore, formulas that are<br>
both lactose free and soy protein-based would exhibit very low sialic acid<br>
content.<br>
[0004]   There are several known sources of sialic acid in its various<br>
conjugated forms. These include, but are not limited to, free N-<br>
acetylneuraminic acid (or sialic acid), the oligosaccharide sialyllactose,<br>
sialic acid-containing gangliosides, and the protein casein macropeptide<br>
(CMP), also referred to as glycomacropeptide (GMP).<br>
[0005]   The addition of sialic acid or sources of sialic acid to certain<br>
nutritional formulas is somewhat known in the art. For example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,506,422 discloses a particular nutritional formula containing<br>
casein glycomacropeptide and complimentary essential amino acids other<br>
than phenylalanine for administration to patients suffering from<br>
phenylketonuria. The levels of sialic acid found in infant formulas are not<br>
mentioned.<br>
[0006]   U.S. Patent No. 6,270,827, discloses a formulation containing<br>
human milk proteins or recombinant host resistance factors, one of which<br>
is recombinant human kappa-casein, to supplement synthetic infant<br>
formulas.<br>
[0007]   U.S. Patent No. 4,762,822 discloses the use of N-<br>
acetylneuraminic acid or gangliosides containing sialic acid in infant<br>
formula to protect the newborn from gastrointestinal disease-producing<br>
organisms.<br>
[0008]   International patent application WO 01/60346 A2 discloses a<br>
nutritional formulation containing the oligosaccharides oligofructose and<br>
sialyllactose as prebiotic substances to promote the growth of<br>
bifidobacteria in the gut that may be used in conjunction with infant<br>
formula.<br>
[0009]   While the use of sialic acid and sialic acid sources in infant<br>
formula appears to be present in some of the prior art, the particular<br>
features of the present invention which provide a nutritionally complete<br>
J<br><br>
milk protein fractions containing sialic acid, or sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides other than lactose may be used. The fat, vitamin, and mineral concentrations of these compositions are otherwise nutritionally appropriate for infants. The total concentration of sialic acid in these formulations would mimic that found in breast milk and may typically be within a range of about 250 mg/L (as found in mature human breast milk) to about 1500 mg/L (as found in human colostrums).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013] Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment.<br>
[0014] Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects, features and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in or are obvious from the following detailed description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention.<br>
[0015] The present invention provides a nutritionally complete formulation that includes one or more sources of sialic acid, in amounts which mimic the concentration of sialic acid found in human breast milk. The present invention additionally provides a method of making such formulations, in the form of milk protein-based formulas, both with and without lactose, non-milk-based formulas, including soy protein-based formulas, amino acid formulas, and rice protein formulas.<br>
The present invention provides a nutritionally complete composition comprising protein wherein said protein comprises casein glycomacropeptide ("cGMP") in an amount sufficient to achieve a total sialic acid content of from 250 mg to 1500 mg per liter of composition, fats in an amount from 3 to 7 g/100 kcal of formula; proteins in an amount from 1 to 5 g/100 kcal of composition; carbohydrates in an amount from 6 to 16 g/100 kcal of formula; vitamins; minerals, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.<br><r></r><br>
[00016] The form of administration of and incorporation of sialic acid in the method of the present invention is not critical, as long as an effective amount is administered. A convenient form of administration is to add sialic acid to an infant formula (including those for both term and preterm infants), follow-on formula, toddler's beverage, milk, yogurt, or fermented product. Alternatively, sialic acid can be administered as a supplement that is not part of a formula feeding such as, for example, drops, sachets or combinations with other nutrients such as vitamins. Sialic acid can be also added to other nutrients suitable for feeding to young children such as, for example, solid baby food, fruit juices, gelatines, cookies, candies, etc. Other examples of administering sialic acid in nutrients can be developed by a person with ordinary skill in the art of infant and child nutrition. All these forms of sialic acid administration, as well as others, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[00017] In one embodiment of the invention, sialic acid is administered as part of an infant formula. The infant formula for use in the present invention is, typically, nutritionally complete and contains suitable types and amounts of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals. The amount of lipids or fats typically can vary from about 3 to about 7 g/100 kcal. The amount of proteins typically can vary from about 1 to about 5g/100 kcal. The amount of carbohydrates typically can vary from about 6 to about 16 g/100 kcal. Protein sources can be any used in the art, and may include, for example, nonfat milk, whey protein, casein, soy protein, hydrolyzed protein, and amino acids. Lipid sources can be any used in the art such as, for example, vegetable oils such as palm oil, soybean oil, palm olein oil, corn oil, canola oil, coconut oil, medium chain triglyceride oils, high oleic sunflower oil, and high oleic safflower oil. Carbohydrate sources can be any known in the art such as, for example, lactose, glucose polymers, corn syrup solids, maltodextrins, sucrose, starch, and rice syrup solids.<br>
[00018] Conveniently, several commercially available infant formulas can be used as the basic formula for the sialic acid or sialic acid-sources<br>
4<br><br>
additions. For example, Enfamil® Lipil with iron (available from Mead Johnson &amp; Company, Evansville, Indiana, U.S.A.) may be supplemented with an effective amount of sialic acid and used to practice the method of the present invention. Particular infant formulas suitable for use in the present invention are described in the Examples herein. [00019] The total protein in the formulation from all protein sources should be nutritionally appropriate for infants, which is typically from about 12 g per liter to 18 g per liter and, in some embodiments, may be about 14 g per liter. The total sialic acid in the formulation may be between about 250 and about 1500 mg per liter and, in one embodiment, between about 300 and about 600 mg per liter. The formulation may contain one or a combination of the following sialic acid-containing protein components: (1) Up to 100% of the protein fraction from a whey protein concentrate, as commercially available from several sources including Davisco, New Zealand Milk, or Formost Farms, exhibiting about 20 - 30 mg sialic acid per gram of protein and, thus, contributing between about 140 and about 560 mg sialic acid per liter of formula; (2) up to 100% of the protein fraction from a nonfat dry milk product, as commercially available from several sources including New Zealand Milk, exhibiting about 2 - 10 mg sialic acid per gram protein and, thus, contributing between about 27 and about 139 mg sialic acid per liter of formula; and (3) up to 6 mg per liter of casein glycomacropeptide (cGMP) or related protein fraction, as commercially available from various sources, exhibiting between about 40 and about 300 mg sialic acid per gram of protein and, thus, contributing between about 194 and about 1458 mg sialic acid per liter of formula.<br>
[00020] When cGMP is employed, the particular casein glycomacropeptide used in the protein source is not critical to the invention. For example, the caseino-glyco-macropeptide may be extracted from milk using suitable processing. For example, the casein glycomacropeptide may be extracted from the retentate obtained from the concentration of whey protein. This may be done by at least partially removing lactose from the retentate and then adding ethanol to cause<br>
1<br><br>
precipitation. The supernatant is then collected and dried to provide the casein glycomacropeptide. U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,129, which is incorporated herein entirely by reference thereto, provides a more detailed description of this process. Alternatively, the casein glycomacropeptide may be purchased from commercial sources. For example, the casein glycomacropeptide may be purchased from MD Foods Ingredients amba of DK-6920 Videbaek, Denmark or from DMV International of NCB-laan 80, NL-5460 BA Veghel, The Netherlands.<br>
[00021] The remainder of the components of the formula, including fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, should be nutritionally appropriate for infants, as found for example in various commercial formulas such as Enfamil with LIPIL, Similac with Iron, or Similac Advance. [00022] The infant formula supplemented with sialic acid for use in the present invention can be made using standard techniques known in the art. For example, sialic acid can be added to the formula by replacing an equivalent amount of other proteins or oligosaccharides. [00023] The following examples describe exemplary embodiments of the invention. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the specification or practice of the invention as disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification, together with the examples, be considered to be exemplary only, with the scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the claims which follow the examples. In the examples all percentages are given on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1 [00024] This example illustrates the nutrient components in a commercial infant formula suitable for sialic acid addition for use in the present invention.<br>
