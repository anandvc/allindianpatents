				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of p-methoxy phenylacetic acid<br>
from p-methoxy acetophenone using sulphur, ammonia as reagents and isopropylalcohol as<br>
media<br>
This invention particularly relates to an economically and technically feasible process for the<br>
preparation of p-methoxy phenylacetic acid from p-methoxy acetophenone using sulphur<br>
ammonia as reagents and isopropyialcohol as solvent dispensing the use of morpholine as<br>
amine for Willgerodt - Kindler reagents. The p-methoxy phenyl acetamide after purification by<br>
crystallization was hydrolyzed in a base at refluxed temperature. The crude phenylacetetic acid<br>
obtained after workup was extracted into hot water, followed by recrystallisation from toluene<br>
there by making the process more economical and convenient yielding the pure product.<br>
p-Methoxy phenylacetic acid is a versatile intermediate used extensively in synthetic orqanic<br>
chemistry. Arylalkanoic acids are used predominantly as building blocks for the production of<br>
, such as dextromethorphan, anti-cough medicine; homoveratric<br>
acid, obtained from 3,4 dimethoxy acetophenone (DMAP) is an importantant pharmaceutical<br>
intermidiate; 4-phenyl phenylacetic acid an analagesic is produced from 4-phenyl acetophenone<br>
and are showing broad range of biological activity i.e., antibacterial, anlagesic, virucida,<br>
prostaglandin synthetase response, plant growth regulator]. It is used as an additive in the<br>
manufacture of (un)substituted indigo dyes. It is also used as corrosion inhibitor for aluminum in<br>
acidic and alkaline solution.<br>
Extensive literature search reveals that the preparation of Arylalkanoic acids from thioamide<br>
proceeds via Willgerodt -Kindler reaction. The thioamide can be synthesied by reacting an aryl<br>
alkanoic ketone or other starting material, sulphur and primary or secondary amine following the<br>
preparation of thioamide which can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding alkanoic acid. The<br>
Willgerodt reaction is well documented reaction between an aryl alkanoic ketone and aq.<br>
ammonium polysulphide to produce an aromatic amide or ammonium salt of the corresponding<br>
acid. It is also applicable for the production of amide for other compounds such as dialkyl<br>
ketone, alphatic mercaptain, secondary and tertiary alcohol, acetals, and aromtic hydrocarbon.<br>
A mixture of sulphur and ammonia is known to be equivalent to ammonium polysulphide in<br>
obtaining the reaction. Kindler's modification to the Willgerodt reaction indicated the use of an<br>
aryl alkanoic ketone, which can be heated with sulphur and primary, secondary amine such as<br>
morpholine and the product is thiomorpholide.<br>
Refernce may be made to J. Sci. Ind. Res., 21B, 1962, 284-5 which reports a method for the<br>
preparation of arylacetic acid from the arylalkyl ketone by modification of Willgerodt -Kindler<br>
reaction involving the use of morpholine and sulphur and reflux with ketone followed by<br>
basification, cooling, filtration and acidification. However this process does not indicate the use<br>
of sulphur removal technique. Refernce may be made to U. S. patent No. 2,489,348 issued<br>
Nov. 29, 1949 which reports the preparation aryl acetic acid and amide. Some examples reveal<br>
the purification of crude acid by basification, filtering and acidification to yield the free acid. This<br>
method does not indicate the use of sulphur nor function like Willgerodt- Kindler reaction.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Patent 2,459,706,1949 wherein the production of amides is<br>
realized by reacting aliphatic mercaptans, ammonia or amine with ammonium polysulphide or<br>
sulphur in secondary or tetairy alcohol via Willgerodt reaction. Reference may be made to U.S.<br>
Patent No. 2,572,809,1951 wherein the Willgerodt reaction between acetal and ammonium<br>
polysulphide or ammonium hydroxide and sulphur in aq. System, secondary or primary amine<br>
and sulphur in anhydrous system to produce amides. Reference may be made to U.S.Patent<br>
2,610,980, 1952 discloses the formation of amide by reacting aromatic hydrocarbon with<br>
ammonium polysulphide or sulphur and ammonia in the presence of water as well as under<br>
anhydrous conditions. Reference may be made to U.S. Patent No.2,689,246,1954 indicates<br>
the Willgerodt reaction of unsaturated nitro compounds with ammonium polysulphide or<br>
ammonia or an amine and sulphur in aq. system for a carboxylic acid amine or an anhydrous<br>
system to form the corresponding thioamide.<br>
Reference may be made to German Patent No. 405,675 ,1924 reports the preparation of<br>
thioamide by reacting aldehyde or ketone with ammonia, primary or seconday amine with<br>
sulphur. However the only specific example utilizing ammonia gas , benzaldehyde is reacted to<br>
form thiobenzamide, Reference may be made to "The Willgerodt Reaction " synthesis 1975, p.<br>
358 wherein reports the Willgerodt reaction of various aryl methyl ketones and other<br>
compounds with ammonium polysulphide or suphur and ammonium hydroxide in an aq. system<br>
to produce aryl acetamide or sulphur and amine such as morpholine in Willgerodt-Kindler<br>
reaction to produce thioamide.<br>
Reference may be made to "The willgerodt reaction " Vol.111 ,1946, 83 reports the Willgerodt<br>
reaction of several aryl ketones with ammonium polysulphide or sulphur and aq. ammonia to<br>
produce aromatic acetamide and also shows example of the Kindler modification involve the<br>
reaction any of various methyl aryl ketones with sulphur and amine in an anhydrous system to<br>
produce acetothioamide. Reference may be made to J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 68, 1946, 2633<br>
describe the preparation of p-hydroxy phenyl acetamide by Willgerodt reaction of p-hydroxy<br>
acetophenone and ammonium sulphide in an aq. System.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to develop an alternative, efficient, eco-nomical<br>
technology for the synthesis of p-methoxy phenylacetic acid from p-methoxy acetophenone by<br>
reacting p-methoxy acetophenone with sulphur in alcoholic ammonia by Willgrodt reaction. In<br>
order to achieve this goal, the process was developed using ammonia as amine in the<br>
Willgerodt reaction under pressure and elevated temperature in alcoholic media. In compliance<br>
with this objective the present invention describes a convenient approach to the desired<br>
synthesis of p-methoxy phenylacetic acid utilizing ammonia as amine, which is commercially<br>
available at affordable price.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The interesting improvement of the invention lies in the use of commercially available ammonia<br>
in isopropyl alcohol as medium wherein p-methoxy actophenone and sulphur are reacted under<br>
pressure and elevated temperature to yield the amide which on hydrolysis in base followed by<br>
work up to yield crude p-methoxy phenylacetic acid which was further purified by extraction into<br>
hot water and subsequent crystallized from toluene. This invention offers good yield,<br>
technically feasible and economically viable. These advantages are quite an impivssing. when compared with the process currently practiced utilizing expensive and non-recoverable morpholine reagent.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the prcpartion of p-substituted phenylacetic acid from p-substituted acetophenone which comprises of following steps:<br>

is employed in amount in the presence of isopropanol as solvent at temperatiution<br>
the range of 100-145°C for a period of 8-10 hrs.<br>
b.	cooling the reaction mixture to 60-65°C and passing through the sodium<br>
hydroxide scrubber (10%, 2.5 Lit) and then cooled to -10°C to obtain phenyl<br>
acetamide;<br>
c.	suspending the above said phenyl acetamide 1.30 moles in about I5° solroer<br>

In one of the embodiment of the present invention, the amine representing ammonia, is<br>
employed in amount such as 6-7mol% with respect to the substrate to obtain highest selectivity<br>
of the desired product.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the solvent represents isopropyl alcohol<br>
that is isopropyl alcohol recovered from previous experiment and re-used in the process without<br>
further purification and treatment.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction is affected at a<br>
temperature preferably in the range of 140-145°C for 8-9 hrs.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the crude product of p-substituted<br>
phenylacetic acid is extracted with hot water to obtain pure product free from sulfur and in-situ<br>
formed sulfide.<br>
In further embodiment of the present invention, A process as claimed in claims 1-5, wherein<br>
the product p-substituted phenylacetic acid finally purified from toluene.<br>
In yet further embodiment of the present invention, the improvement comprising the<br>
employment of ammonia as amine substantially reduces difficulties pertaining to process<br>
operation for the recovery of amine such as morpholine.<br>
In yet further embodiment of the present invention, the improvement comprising the<br>
employment of ammonia as amine makes the process more viable and economical.<br>
In still further embodiment of the present invention, the improvement resulting from the<br>
method of claims 6&amp;7 offers convenience and eliminates steps of purification such as high<br>
vacuum distillation.<br>
Scientific Explanation<br>
The use of morpholine for Willgerodt reaction posed serious problem of recovering the<br>
morpholine. The use of dimethyl amine as amine for Willgerodt reaction did not add any<br>
advantage either economically or technically and thus made the.process more un-economical<br>
by using other amines. The use of ammonia is proved to be the best in terms of economics of<br>
the process. The use of sulphur leads to the formation of H2S, which was well protected, from<br>
the environment by using the autoclave under pressure followed by digesting the effluent with<br>
an appropriate scrubber and thus to make the process more ecofriendly and technically feasible.<br>
The formed amide was purified from impurities like colour and polymeric material by<br>
crystallization from alcohol used as medium for the reaction. Initially the crude target product<br>
obtained after hydrolysis has been purified from the unreacted sulphur and insitu formed<br>
suifides by extracting into water instead of using organic solvents for the same and finally by<br>
crystallization from toluene made the process more economical, simple and viable. Finally, this<br>
invention also explores the reusability of the solvent isopropyl alcohol, recovered from the<br>
reaction mixture, without further purification. Thus, the invented strategy offers an economical,<br>
simple and viable process for the synthesis of p-methoxy phenyl acetic acid from p-methoxy<br>
acetophenone in a batch process.<br>
The invention is described in the examples given below which are produced by way of<br>
illustrations only and therefore should not be constrained to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
Reagents used are purified as follows: Isopropyl alcohol freshly distilled, Sulphur and ammonia<br>
gas are used as commercially available grade.<br>
4-methoxy acetophenone in an amount of 300 g (2 mol.), sulfur in an amount of 192 g (6 mol)<br>
and isopropanol in an amount 1700 g saturated with ammonia gas (238 g ,14 mol) at -5°C<br>
were charged into a 5 lit titanium autoclave. The autoclave was sealed. The reaction mixture<br>
was heated to 140 °C under vigorous stirring and continued the stirring for 8hrs at 140 °C<br>
during which time the autogenous pressure in the autoclave rose from 15 psig upto 250 psig at<br>
the end of reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to 60-65°C and slowly digested the effluent<br>
gas by passing through the sodium hydroxide scrubber (10%, 2.5 lit.) to minimize the effluent<br>
generated during the reaction. The mixture was discharged from the reactor and then cooled to<br>
-10 °C and obtained the crystalline phenyl acetamide in 65% after filtration and drying in air.<br>
The phenyl acetamide 215 g(1.30 moles), was suspended in 15 % solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
235 g.(5.88 moles). The reaction mixture was heated slowly to102°C under stirring. After<br>
hydrolysis, the reaction mixture was moderately cooled to 45 to 50°Cand filtered off the<br>
insolubles, polymeric materials. The filtrate was further cooled to room temperature and acidified<br>
using 30-35% HCI acid 450g to pH 6 and filtered again to remove any solid effluent. The filtrate<br>
obtained at pH 6 was cooled 5°C and acidified again using 30-35 % HCI acid 55 g to pH 4 to<br>
obtained crude p-methoxy phenylacetic acid 249g (75%).<br>
The crude phenyl acetic 100 g was extracted into hot water 1000ml at 90°C. The water extract<br>
was cooled to 5°C and obtained white crystals of p-methoxy phenylacetic acid which was further<br>
purified by crystallization from 500 ml toluene and obtained pure apha white crystals of<br>
phenylacetic acid 55%.<br>

EXAMPLE 4:<br>
Following the standard procedure as above and utilizing the following amounts of reagents:<br>
p-hydroxy acetophenone 272g,(2moles), sulphur 192g(moles), isopropanol 1700 g, ammonia<br>
gas (238 g ,14 mol),for hydrolysis sodium hydroxide 235 g.(5.88 moles),30-35% HCI acid 505 g.<br>
afforded pure(&gt;99) p-hydroxy phenylacetic acid (152g 50% yield).<br>
EXAMPLE 5:<br>
The solvent isopropyl alcohol, recovered from the first experiment (Example 1), is used here<br>
without further purification. All other reagents are purified as described earlier.<br>
Following the standard procedure as above and utilizing the following amounts of: p-methoxy<br>
acetophenone 300g, (2.0moles), sulphur 192g(6.0moles), isopropanol 1700 g, ammonia gas<br>
(238 g ,14 mol), for hydrolysis sodium hydroxide 235 g.(5.88 moles),30-35% HCI acid 505 g.<br>
afforded pure(&gt;99%) p-methoxy phenylacetic acid (182g 55% yield).<br>
The present process has several advantages as described below:<br>
1 The process is economically and technically feasible.<br>
