				<td>DETERGENT ALKYLATION USING A RARE EARTH EXCHANGED CATALYST<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention is directed to highly selective, modified catalysts and the<br>
process of using the catalysts. The catalysts are for use in the alkylation of aromatic<br>
compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Alkylation of benzene produces alkylbenzenes that may find various commercial<br>
uses, e.g., alkylbenzenes can be sulfonated to produce surfactants, for use in detergents. In<br>
the alkylation process, benzene is reacted with an olefin the desired length to produce the<br>
sought alkylbenzene. The alkylation conditions comprise the presence of homogeneous or<br>
heterogeneous alkylation catalyst such as aluminum chloride, hydrogen fluoride, or zeolitic<br>
catalysts and elevated temperature.<br>
[0003] Various processes have been proposed to alkylate benzene. One commercial<br>
process involves the use of hydrogen fluoride as the alkylation catalyst. The use and<br>
handling of hydrogen fluoride does provide operational concerns due to its toxicity,<br>
corrosiveness and waste disposal needs. Solid catalytic processes have been developed that<br>
obviate the need to use hydrogen fluoride. Improvements in these solid catalytic processes<br>
are sought to further enhance their attractiveness through reducing energy costs and<br>
improving selectivity of conversion while still providing an alkylbenzene of a quality<br>
acceptable for downstream use such as sulfonation to make surfactants.<br>
[0004] Alkylbenzenes, to be desirable for making sulfonated surfactants must be capable<br>
of providing a sulfonated product of suitable clarity, biodegradability and efficacy. With<br>
respect to efficacy, alkylbenzenes having higher 2-phenyl contents are desired as they tend,<br>
when sulfonated, to provide surfactants having better solubility and detergency. Thus,<br>
alkylbenzenes having a 2-phenyl isomer content in the range from 25 to 35 percent are<br>
particularly desired.<br>
[0005] Improvements in the catalysts have facilitated the production of linear<br>
alkylbenzenes, as shown in US 6,133,492, US 6,521,804, US 6,977,319, and US 6,756,030.<br>
However, problems exist with many existing catalysts, and a better understanding, can lead to<br>
further improvements in the catalysts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention provides for a process for producing a monoalkylated<br>
aromatic compound having an increased linearity of the alkyl group. The process comprises<br>
reacting an aromatic feedstock with an olefinic compound in an alkylation reactor at reaction<br>
conditions using a catalyst, where the catalyst has a rare earth element incorporated into the<br>
zeolitic framework. The catalyst has a silica to alumina ratio of less than 8, and the rare earth<br>
element is exchanged to a degree such that the molar ratio of rare earth element to aluminum<br>
is between 0.17 and 0.4. When taking valance charge into account, the ratio is between 0.51<br>
and 1.2, with the balance being alkali, alkaline earth, ammonium cations or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0007] In one embodiment, the process includes adding water to the feed to the reactor.<br>
The water is added in an amount to keep the water below 1000 ppm by weight of the total<br>
feed to the reactor. The process is operated at conditions to keep the reactants in the liquid<br>
phase.<br>
[0008] Other objects, advantages and applications of the present invention will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from the following drawings and detailed description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0009] Figure 1 shows the linearity of catalysts that have retained some alkali cations.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] Catalysts are strongly affected by materials that either combine with the catalyst,<br>
or can in one form or another reduce the catalytic activity of the catalyst. These materials are<br>
poisons to the catalyst, and include materials such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals,<br>
ammonia, amine and their ions. These poisons are typical, and lead to pretreatments of feeds<br>
to catalytic reactors to protect the catalyst, by removing any poisons in the process stream.<br>
As shown by Venuto, P. B., et al., J of Catal, 4, 81-98, 87 (1966), "[l]ow sodium levels were<br>
critical for high alkylation activity with REX catalyst." As the sodium level was increased<br>
from 0.22 wt. % to 0.79 wt. %, the activity decreased to almost half.<br>
[001 1 ] The alkylation of aromatics with olefins in important for several commercially<br>
important technologies. Ethyl benzene (EB), cumene (isopropyl benzene), and larger chained<br>
alkylbenzenes (detergents) are the three most economically important examples. The<br>
detergents preferably made using longer chained linear alkyl groups, such as C8 to CI3, to<br>
form linear alkyl benzenes. These alkylation reactions are carried out using acid catalysts,<br>
either homogeneous catalysts such as HF, or heterogeneous catalyst such as A1C13, silicaalumina,<br>
and zeolites. Although these are all acid catalyzed processes, there are enough<br>
differences that they are all practiced with different catalysts. Skeletal isomerization is an<br>
example of a concern in the LAB process, and which makes the use of catalysts suitable for<br>
EB or cumene of less value in the LAB process.<br>
[OO 12] The production of linear alkylbenzenes has traditionally been made in two<br>
commercial forms, low 2-phenyl and high 2-phenyl. Low 2-phenyl LAB is made by HF<br>
alkylation and results in a 2-phenyl concentration between 15 and 20 mass percent of the<br>
LAB. This is due to the homogeneous acid, HF, lack of preference for catalyzing the<br>
attachment of the benzene to the olefin chain. There is not alkylation on the terminal<br>
carbons, and the internal carbons have a nearly equal probability of alkylation, and which<br>
produces shorter chained alkyl groups extending from the benzene. High 2-phenyl LAB has<br>
historically been made using AICI 3 alkylation and results in a 2-phenyl concentration<br>
between 30 and 35 mass percent of the LAB. While it is possible to produce LAB with<br>
different 2-phenyl contents, there is no market for these products, and consequently the<br>
efforts have been to replace these environmentally unfriendly catalysts.<br>
[0013] In 1995, UOP and Cepsa introduced a detergent alkylation process using the first<br>
environmentally friendly solid bed alkylation process for the production of LAB. The<br>
catalyst was a fluorided silica-alumina catalyst, and the process produces a high 2-phenyl<br>
LAB product. This process has nearly completely replaces the use of AICI 3 in detergent<br>
alkylation. However, it uses considerably more energy than the HF process due to the much<br>
higher benzene to olefin ratio in the process, and produces slightly more dialkylate than the<br>
HF process.<br>
[0014] While ethylbenzene, cumene and LAB are all produced in processes using acid<br>
catalysts, there are a number of key features that differentiate LAB from either ethylbenzene<br>
or cumene. One is the length of the olefin and the reactions that the olefin can undergo.<br>
Solid acid catalysts are know to catalyze both double bond isomerization and skeletal<br>
isomerization in linear olefins. Most studies of double bond and skeletal isomerization of<br>
linear olefins has focused on 1-butene. This is due to the desire to make isobutene for<br>
MTBE, an oxygenate for gasoline, or polyisobutene. Gee and Prampin, Applied Catalysis A:<br>
General 360 (2009), 71-80. Even a week acid catalyst, like SAPO-1 1, produces skeletal<br>
isomerization, and is easily observed at 142C, and that skeletal isomerization is temperature<br>
dependent.<br>
[0015] It is known that skeletal isomerization of linear olefins occurs in the production of<br>
LAB over solid acid catalysts. In 1965, in an article titled "Hydroisomerization of Normal<br>
Olefins Under Alkylation Conditions" showed that skeletal isomerization was favored by<br>
high acid concentrations and high temperatures (Peterson, A. H.; Phillips, B. L.; and<br>
Kelly, J . T.; I&amp;EC, 4, No. 4, 261-265, 1965). Also, as shown in US 4,301,317 to Young,<br>
Table 2, in the reference, compares the amount of linear phenyldodecane produced by<br>
alkylation of 1-dodecene with benzene over eight different zeolites. All of the zeolites<br>
exhibited skeletal isomerization. Inhibiting skeletal isomerization is an important challenge<br>
to be addressed, if one is to produce highly linear detergent range alkylbenzenes. It is further<br>
worth noting that Beta zeolite, which is commonly used in the production of ethylbenzene<br>
and cumene is unsuitable for detergent range LAB production due to its tendency to<br>
skeletally isomerizes the linear olefins prior to their alkylation. Because ethylene and<br>
propylene only have one isomer, both the double bond and skeletal isomerization of the<br>
catalyst are moot and for this reason one cannot predict that a process or catalyst for<br>
ethylbenzene or cumene production will necessarily extend to LAB.<br>
[0016] A second difference between alkylation of long chain linear olefins with benzene<br>
differs from that of ethylbenzene or cumene is the number of products. Ethylbenzene and<br>
cumene are unique chemical compounds whereas LAB is a mixture of compounds that results<br>
from the fact that long chain linear olefins have multiple positions for the benzene to insert<br>
itself. As can be seen from Young's data in US 4,301,317, molecular sieves can reduce or<br>
prohibit the formation of some phenylalkane isomers. This is phenomena is called shape<br>
selectivity and occurs because the molecular sieve doesn't possess enough space for the<br>
molecule to be formed. Since the commercially desirable detergent range linear<br>
alkylbenzenes, "low 2-phenyl LAB" and "high 2-phenyl LAB" have relative narrow<br>
windows on their 2-phenylalkane content, an acidic molecular sieve catalyst that has good<br>
characteristics for producing ethylbenzene or cumene cannot be assumed to be appropriate<br>
for producing commercially acceptable detergent range LAB.<br>
[00 17] A third way in which the alkylation of long chain linear olefins with benzene<br>
differs from that of ethylbenzene or cumene is in the impact of the benzene to olefin ratio.<br>
Alkylation processes to convert ethylene to ethylbenzene and propylene to cumene operate at<br>
significantly low benzene to olefin ratios than solid detergent alkylation processes. It has<br>
long been known that monoalkylate selectivity can be maximized by operating at high<br>
benzene to olefin ratios. High benzene to olefin ratios also means the ratio of benzene to<br>
monoalkylate is high and the higher the weight fraction of benzene relative to other<br>
aromatics, the higher the yield of monoalkylate. In the production of ethylbenzene or<br>
cumene low benzene to olefin ratios can be employed to minimize energy usage because the<br>
polyethylbenzene or polypropylbenzene can be easily transalkylated with benzene to produce<br>
the desired product, ethylbenzene or cumene. In the detergent alkylation process, where a<br>
solid fluorided amorphous silica-alumina catalyst is employed, shape selectivity does not<br>
come into play due to the very large pores and the only way to control the amount of<br>
dialkylbenzene is to use high benzene to olefin ratios. Converting long chain linear<br>
dialkylbenzenes back to long chain linear monoalkylbenzenes can be done, but with<br>
significantly lower efficiency than for ethylbenzene or cumene. Some of the transalkylation<br>
occurs though dealkylation followed by alkylation with benzene. When transalkylation<br>
occurs through this pathway some of the olefin undergoes skeletal isomerization, which<br>
lowers overall product linearity.<br>
[0018] Low benzene to olefin ratios also promotes the skeletal isomerization of linear<br>
olefins. Because skeletal isomerization is a monomolecular reaction and alkylation is a<br>
bimolecular reaction, lowering the benzene to olefin ratio effectively increases the olefin<br>
concentration which causes the rate of olefin skeletal isomerization to increase faster than the<br>
rate of olefin alkylation. Thus, in solid detergent alkylation processes, one is faced with the<br>
choice of operating at high benzene to olefin ratios and accepting the high energy cost or<br>
finding catalysts with the appropriate acidity such that skeletal isomerization of the linear<br>
olefins is minimal.<br>
[0019] It has been found that incorporating some rare earth elements into a zeolite<br>
supercage, the efficiency is increased in producing a primary alkylation product. The means<br>
to achieve an increasing amount of rare earth into the structure is by using a lower ratio<br>
Faujasite and a designed rare earth incorporation technique. By low ratio, it is meant to<br>
indicate the silica to alumina ratio.<br>
[0020] The incorporation of rare earth exchanged low ratio zeolite reduces the geometric<br>
space in the supercage, and it also reduces acidity due to an increase in the number of<br>
framework aluminum at the low ratios. The reduced space and acidity significantly<br>
suppresses the isomerization and cracking pathways, while the primary alkylation pathway is<br>
not affected. This increases product by decreasing the undesired side reactions that occur.<br>
One of the benefits from the new catalyst is a high linearity of the alkylbenzene for use in<br>
detergent alkylation. Contrary to what one would expect, it was found that incorporating or<br>
leaving some alkali or alkaline earth cations in the catalyst significantly improves catalyst<br>
performance. And especially in the performance around the linearity of the alkylbenzene,<br>
and the retention of linearity at increased operating temperatures. The present invention is<br>
aimed at producing a product having a linearity of at least 90%.<br>
[002 1] The present invention comprises a new catalyst for alkylation of aromatics<br>
comprising a zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio of less than 8, and a rare earth<br>
element incorporated into the zeolitic framework. The silica to alumina molar ratio is<br>
preferably less than 6 and more preferably less than 5.6. The catalyst can be a low silica to<br>
alumina molar ratio Y type zeolite, X type zeolite, or a zeolite have EMT/FAU intergrowth.<br>
[0022] The catalyst is formed by using a Y zeolite or X zeolite and modified with an<br>
alkali or alkaline earth element or nitrogen compound, such as sodium, barium, ammonia or<br>
amine to control the acidity. The catalyst is then ion exchanged with a rare earth element to<br>
remove a portion of the alkali or alkaline earth elements, and to provide for larger ions in the<br>
zeolites cages. The catalyst can be in extruded or bead form. The catalyst can be prepared<br>
by first exchanging the zeolite powder with a rare earth element and then forming the zeolite<br>
into pellets or beads. An alternative is to form the zeolite into pellets or beads and then<br>
perform the rare earth exchange.<br>
[0023] When the catalyst is a Y type zeolite, the silica to alumina molar ratio is between<br>
2.8 and 8, and preferably between 3 and 6, and when the catalyst is an X type zeolite, the<br>
silica to alumina molar ratio is between 2 and 2.8.<br>
[0024] The catalyst includes a rare earth element that is incorporated into the supercages<br>
of the zeolite to provide some steric restraint. The supercages are large cavities, relative to<br>
the pores, in the zeolites that usually have a diameter greater than 1 nm. The supercages are<br>
sometimes cavities formed with the intersection of different pores in the zeolite. This is a<br>
region where there is less steric hindrance for some catalytic reactions when compared with<br>
the pores. This limits undesirable side reactions. Rare earth elements that can be used<br>
include at least one of the following: scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium<br>
(Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), europium<br>
(Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thullium<br>
(Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium (Lu). Preferred rare earth elements include at least one<br>
of yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd),<br>
gadolinium (Gd), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), and ytterbium (Yb).<br>
[0025] The rare earth element is cation exchanged with the zeolite sufficient to where the<br>
rare earth element to aluminum molar ratio is between 0.5 1 and 1.2. The catalyst is further<br>
cation exchanged with an alkali, an alkaline earth element, or nitrogen compound cation.<br>
[0026] The catalyst can further include a binder wherein the binder comprises alumina,<br>
silica, magnesium silicates, zirconia, and mixtures thereof. The binder can also comprise<br>
natural or synthetic clays, which are made up of various metal oxides. The binder provides<br>
hardness to the catalyst to improve the physical durability of the catalyst from abrasion<br>
during operation.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the catalyst is an X type zeolite having an alumina molar ratio<br>
less than 2.8. A rare earth element is incorporated into the zeolitic framework. The rare<br>
earth elements include yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr),<br>
neodymium (Nd), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium<br>
(Ho), erbium (Er), thullium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium (Lu). Preferred rare earth<br>
elements include yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium<br>
(Nd), gadolinium (Gd), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er) and ytterbium (Yb). The rare earth<br>
elements contribute to developing steric hindrance within the zeolite pores, and modifying<br>
the acidity of the X type zeolite, to reduce the acidity from strong to moderate. It is preferred<br>
that the silica to alumina molar ratio is less than 2.8, and more preferably less than 2.5, with a<br>
most preferred ratio between 1 and 2.4.<br>
[0028] The catalyst has the rare earth elements exchanged to a degree that the molar ratio<br>
of rare earth elements to aluminum in the catalyst is in the range between 0.5 1 and 1.2. A<br>
balance of the cation exchange to control the acidity is with alkali or alkaline earth elements.<br>
[0029] In the detergent alkylation process, the retention of linearity of the alkyl group is<br>
important for the quality of the detergents produced from alkylaromatics. It was found that<br>
the incorporation of some alkali, or alkaline earth, elements on the catalyst improved the<br>
catalyst performance with respect to retaining linearity of the alkyl group without affecting<br>
the activity adversely. The results of alkylation tests with the rare earth exchanged catalyst<br>
show the high degree of linearity of the product over a wide range of operating temperatures<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
[0030] The process for producing a monoalkylated aromatic compound comprises:<br>
passing an aromatic feedstock and an olefinic compound to an alkylation reactor. The<br>
alkylation reactor has an alkylation catalyst comprising a zeolite having a silica to alumina<br>
molar ratio less than 8 and includes a rare earth element incorporated into the zeolitic<br>
framework. The reactor generates an effluent stream comprising the monoalkylated aromatic<br>
compound, and is passed to a separation unit. The separation unit recovers the<br>
monoalkylated aromatic compound, and generates an aromatic stream and a non-product<br>
alkylated aromatic stream. The non-product alkylated aromatic stream generally comprises<br>
dialkylated aromatic compounds and can be passed to a transalkylation reactor to improve the<br>
product yield.<br>
[0031] Aromatic compounds and olefins are reacted under alkylation conditions in the<br>
presence of a solid alkylation catalyst. The alkylation conditions generally include a<br>
temperature in the range between 80°C and 200°C, most usually at a temperature not<br>
exceeding 175°C, e.g., 100°C to 160°C. Typically, as the catalyst ages, the temperature of<br>
the alkylation is increased to maintain desired activity. The alkylation is an exothermic<br>
reaction and thus in a substantially adiabatic reactor, the effluent is at a higher temperature<br>
than that of the feed. A substantially adiabatic reactor is one where the increase in<br>
temperature of the effluent over that of the feed accounts for at least 75 percent of heat<br>
generated by the reactions in the reaction zone. The preferred aromatic compound is<br>
benzene, and the preferred olefins are linear alpha olefins having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
During the alkylation process, the catalyst deactivates, and the temperature is allowed to<br>
increase to compensate for catalyst deactivation. With deactivation, and with increases in<br>
temperature, product linearity is reduced. This catalyst minimizes the changes in the product<br>
linearity over the life of the catalyst and extends the useful life of the catalyst, by maintaining<br>
a higher product linearity during the process, such that with increasing temperature, there is<br>
still a high degree of linearity maintained over prior catalysts.<br>
[0032] The temperature within a reaction zone is maintained within a suitable range by<br>
providing a large excess of aromatic compound to the reaction zone to absorb heat. Where<br>
the aliphatic feedstock contains paraffins, the paraffins also serve to absorb heat from the<br>
exothermic reactions. High exothermic temperatures during the alkylation can result in<br>
untoward effects in terms of not only catalyst deactivation but also in product quality<br>
degradation, especially skeletal isomerization, and, in particular, skeletal isomerization of the<br>
olefin.<br>
[0033] The alkylation reactor is generally a fixed bed type reactor, where the reactants<br>
flow over the catalyst as the reactants flow through the reactor. The catalyst can be<br>
regenerated in the alkylation reactor to remove carbon deposits by taking the reactor off-line.<br>
[0034] The alkylation reactor can also comprise a plurality of reactors with intercoolers<br>
between the reactors to remove heat and maintain the operation in a desirable temperature<br>
range.<br>
[0035] In one embodiment, the catalyst in the present alkylation reaction process is an X<br>
type zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio less than 2.8, and the zeolite includes a rare<br>
earth element incorporated into the zeolitic framework. The rare earth elements include at<br>
least one from the group comprising: yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce),<br>
praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb),<br>
dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thullium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium<br>
(Lu).<br>
[0036] The alkylation process with the new catalyst also can include the addition of water<br>
to the alkylation reactor. The water in the reactor adsorbs onto the catalyst during the<br>
reaction, and comprises between 0.5 and 6 weight percent of the total catalyst weight. A<br>
preferred amount of water adsorbed onto the catalyst comprises between 1 and 3 weight<br>
percent of the total catalyst weight. The amount of water is low and kept to below 1000 ppm<br>
by weight of the combined feed of aromatic compound and olefin to the alkylation reactor.<br>
Preferably, the amount of water is less than 900 ppm by weight of the combined feed to the<br>
reactor.<br>
[0037] The alkylation process for detergent alkylation is preferably operated in the liquid<br>
phase. To maintain the reactants in the liquid phase, the reactor is operated at a pressure<br>
between 1300 and 7000 kPa, with a preferred operating pressure between 2500 and 4500 kPa.<br>
[0038] In an alternate embodiment, the process of benzene alkylation comprises passing<br>
an aromatic feedstock and an olefinic compound to an alkylation reactor. The alkylation<br>
reactor has an alkylation catalyst comprising a Y or X type zeolite having greater than<br>
16.5 wt% of rare earth in the zeolite with the balance being alkali, alkaline earth element, or<br>
nitrogen compound cations incorporated into the zeolitic framework. The choice of rare<br>
earth elements is as stated above. In the preferred operation the catalyst has a silica to<br>
alumina molar ratio between 3 and 6.<br>
[0039] Experiments were performed where catalyst A is the catalyst of the present<br>
invention and catalysts B, C, D and E were prepared for comparative purposes. Catalyst A<br>
was prepared by rare earth exchange of Y-54 of 0.3 M of rare earth solution made up from<br>
rare earth stock solution obtained from Moly Corp. at 75-80°C for 2 hours. The exchange<br>
utilizes 1.0 gm of rare earth solution per gram of Y-54 powder on an as received basis. At<br>
the end of the rare earth exchange, the slurry is filtered under vacuum and the resulting filter<br>
cake is washed with 10 grams of de-ionized water per gram of powder. The filter cake is<br>
dried and then steamed at 550°C at 50% steam for 1.5 hours. The steamed rare earth<br>
exchanged powder is exchanged with a second rare earth solution and water wash following<br>
the same procedure as above. The powder is formulated into a catalyst of cylindrical pellets<br>
with 1/16" (0.16 cm) diameter consisting of 80 wt% zeolite and 20 wt% binder on a volatile<br>
free basis.<br>
[0040] Catalysts B, C, D and E are prepared following the same procedure used for<br>
preparing catalyst A, with the exception that no second rare earth exchange is performed.<br>
Instead, an ammonium exchange step of various degrees is performed following the steaming<br>
step to yield a final powder of different rare earth and sodium contents. The ammonium<br>
exchange is typically done at 70°C for 1 to 2 hours using a 10 wt% NH4NO3 solution.<br>
Table - Catalyst Property and Sensitivity of Product Linearity to Temperatures<br>
[0041] The catalyst is tested in a plug flow reactor operating at inlet temperatures from<br>
95 to 130°C. The test condition includes a benzene to olefin molar ratio of the feed of 30, a<br>
pressure of 500 psig, and catalyst LHSV is 3.75 hr 1. The reaction is carried out in liquid<br>
phase condition. The olefin conversions are 100% or close to 100% with the calculations<br>
based on the Bromine Index in the feed and the product. The composition of the product is<br>
analyzed by gas chromatography. The product linearity is summarized in Figure 1. The<br>
sensitivity of product linearity to temperature is shown in Figure 1 and reported also in the<br>
Table along with the zeolite properties. The data show that product linearity and the<br>
sensitivity of product linearity to temperatures are a function of rare earth and sodium<br>
contents. As shown in the Table, Catalyst A contains greater than 16.5 wt% rare earth and<br>
has higher sodium content. It shows higher product linearity, which is not sensitive to<br>
temperature changes. Conceivably, the catalyst is capable of operating over a wide range of<br>
temperatures without incurring changes in product linearity. Furthermore, as the catalyst<br>
deactivates with time, the operating temperature needs to be adjusted upward to compensate<br>
for the activity degradation. Catalyst A can achieve the goal of maintaining the activity via<br>
raising the operating temperature without sacrificing the product linearity.<br>
[0042] While the invention has been described with what are presently considered the<br>
preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments, but it is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements<br>
included within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
