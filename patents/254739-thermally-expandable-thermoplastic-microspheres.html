				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br>
The present invention relates to thermally expandable thermoplastic<br>
microspheres, production and use thereof, and an aqueous slurry comprising such<br>
microspheres, as well as expanded microspheres.<br>
Expandable thermoplastic microspheres comprising a thermoplastic polymer<br>
shell encapsulating a propellant are commercially available under the trademark<br>
EXPANCEL® and are used as a foaming agent in many different applications.<br>
In such microspheres, the propellant is normally a liquid having a boiling<br>
temperature not higher than the softening temperature of the thermoplastic polymer shell.<br>
Upon heating, the propellant evaporates to increase the internal pressure at the same<br>
time as the shell softens, resulting in significant expansion of the microspheres. The<br>
temperature at which the expansion starts is called Tstart, while the temperature at which<br>
maximum expansion is reached is called Tmax. Expandable microspheres are marketed in<br>
various forms, e.g. as dry free flowing particles, as an aqueous slurry or as a partially<br>
dewatered wet-cake.<br>
Expandable microspheres can be produced by polymerising ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers in the presence of a propellant. Detailed descriptions of various<br>
expandable microspheres and their production can be found in, for example, US Patents<br>
3615972, 3945956, 4287308, 5536756, 6235800, 6235394 and 6509384, in US Patent<br>
Applications Publications US 2004/0176486 and 2005/0079352, in GB 1024195, in EP<br>
486080 and EP 1288272, in WO 2004/072160, and in JP Laid Open No. 1987-286534,<br>
2005-213379 and 2005-272633.<br>
One important application for expandable microspheres is paper making as<br>
described in e.g. US Patents 3556934 and 4133688, JP Patent 2689787, JP Laid Open<br>
No. 2003-105693, WO 2004/113613, WO 2006/068573, WO 2006/068574 and in Ö.<br>
Soderberg, "World Pulp &amp; Paper Technology 1995/96, The International Review for the<br>
Pulp &amp; Paper Industry" p. 143-145.<br>
Other important applications for expandable microspheres are printing inks, vinyl<br>
foams (e.g. plastisols), non-woven and artificial leather.<br>
In some applications it is desirable that the microspheres have a comparatively<br>
low Tatarl. However, the polymer shell in commercially available microspheres with a low<br>
Tstart are usually made of a monomer mixture comprising halogen containing monomers<br>
like vinylidene chloride. Such microspheres usually suffer from high amounts of residual<br>
monomers and poor resistance to chemicals, like solvents and plasticisers used in<br>
artificial leathers and plastisols. Attempts to make microspheres with low Tstart and high<br>
expansion capability without halogen containing monomers have not yet solved these<br>
problems satisfactorily<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to provide expandable microspheres with high<br>
expansion capability and low Tstart, preferably having high resistance to chemicals and<br>
without including high amounts of halogen containing monomers.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to provide expandable microspheres<br>
useful in paper making or in printing inks, for example as a foaming agent therein.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the production of<br>
paper.<br>
It is still a further object of the invention to provide an aqueous slurry comprising<br>
expandable microspheres useful in the production of paper.<br>
It has surprisingly been found possible to fulfil these objects by providing<br>
microspheres with a polymer shell made from certain combinations of monomers.<br>
One aspect of the invention concerns thermally expandable thermoplastic<br>
microspheres comprising a polymer shell made from ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
encapsulating a propellant, said ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising from 20<br>
to 80 wt% of acrylonitrile and from 1 to 70 wt% of vinyl ether having only one carbon-to-<br>
carbon double bond, the total amount of acrylonitrile and vinyl ether having only one<br>
carbon-to-carbon double bond being from 30 to 100 wt%, preferably from 50 to 100 wt%<br>
or from 65 to 100 wt% of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated monomers preferably comprise from 1 to 60 wt%,<br>
most preferably from 1 to 50 wt% or 5 to 50 wt% of vinyl ether having only one carbon-to-<br>

The ethylenically unsaturated monomers may further comprise one or more<br>
esters of acrylic acid, esters of methacrylic acid and mixtures thereof. The amount of such<br>
monomers may, for example, be from 1 to 50, preferably from 5 to 40.<br><br>
If included, esters of methacrylic acid may, for example, be one or more of<br>
methyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate or<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate, of which methyl methacrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
If included, esters of acrylic acid may, for example, be one or more of methyl<br>
acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate or<br>
hydroxyethylacrylate, of which methyl acrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
It is preferred that the ethylenically unsaturated monomers are substantially free<br>
from vinylidene chloride. If included, the amount thereof is preferably less than 10 wt%,<br>
most preferably less than 5 wt%, or even less than 1 wt% of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers. It is also preferred that the ethylenically unsaturated monomers are<br>
substantially free from any halogen containing monomers. If included, the amount thereof<br>
is preferably less than 10 wt%, most preferably less than 5 wt%, or even less than 1 wt%<br>

functional monomers may, for example, be from 0.1 to 10 wt% or from 0.1 to 1 wt% or<br>
from 1 to 3 wt% of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers, 0.1 to 1 wt% being<br>
particularly preferred in case the one or more multifunctional monomers are at least tri-<br>

multifunctional monomers are di-functional.<br>
If ethylenically unsaturated monomers other than acrylonitrile, vinyl ether,<br>
methacrylonitrile, esters of acrylic acid, esters of methacrylic acid and one or more<br><br>
crosslinking multifunctional monomers, are included, the amount thereof is preferably<br>
from 0 to 10 wt%, most preferably from 0 to 5 wt%. Examples of such other kinds of<br>
monomers that may be included are nitrile containing monomers such as α-<br>
ethoxyacrylonitrile, fumaronitrile or crotonitrile; vinyl pyridine; vinyl esters such as vinyl<br>
acetate; styrenes such as styrene, halogenated styrenes or a-methyl styrene; dienes<br>
such as butadiene, isoprene and chloroprene; unsaturated carboxylic compounds like<br>
acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and salts thereof; or other unsaturated monomers like<br>

In an embodiment of the invention the ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
substantially consist of acrylonitrile, alkyl vinyl ether, methacrylonitrile, one or more esters<br>
of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and one or more crosslinking multifunctional<br>
monomers. In another embodiment the ethylenically unsaturated monomers substantially<br>

multifunctional monomers. In still another embodiment the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers substantially consist of acrylonitrile, alkyl vinyl ether, one or more esters of<br>
acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and one or more crosslinking multifunctional monomers.<br>
In a further embodiment the ethylenically unsaturated monomers substantially consist of<br>
acrylonitrile, alkyl vinyl ether, and one or more crosslinking multifunctional monomers.<br>
The softening temperature of the polymer shell, normally corresponding to its<br>
glass transition temperature (Tg), is preferably within the range from 0 to 140°C, most<br>
preferably from 30 to 100°C.<br>
The propellant is normally a liquid having a boiling temperature not higher than<br>
the softening temperature of the thermoplastic polymer shell and may comprise one or<br>
more hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane,<br>
isopentane, neo-pentane, cyclopentane, hexane, isohexane, neo-hexane, cyclohexane,<br>
heptane, isoheptane, octane and isooctane, isododecane. Aside from them, other<br>
hydrocarbon types can also be used, such as petroleum ether, or chlorinated or<br>
fluorinated hydrocarbons, such as methyl chloride, methylene chloride, dichloroethane,<br>
dichloroethylene, trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, trichlorofluoromethane, perfluorinated<br>
hydrocarbons, fluorine containing ethers, etc. Preferred propellants comprise at least one<br>
of propane, n-butane, isobutane or isopentane, alone or in mixture, or in a mixture with<br>
one or more other hydrocarbons. The amount of n-butane and/or isobutane and/or<br>
isopentane in the propellant is preferably from 50 to 100 wt%, most preferably from 75 to<br>
100 wt%. If propane is present, the amount thereof in the propellant is preferably from 10<br>
to 50 wt%. The boiling point of the propellant at atmospheric pressure is preferably within<br>
the range from -50 to 100°C, most preferably from -40 or -30 to 50°C, or from -30 or -20<br>
to 30°C.<br><br>
Tstart for the expandable ..microspheres is preferably from 40 to 140°C, most<br>
preferably from 50 to 100°C. Tmax for the expandable microspheres is preferably from 80<br>
to 200°C, most preferably from 100 to 170°C.<br>
Apart from the polymer shell and the propellant the microspheres may comprise<br>
further substances added during the production thereof, normally in an amount from 0 to<br>
20 wt%, preferably from 1 to 10 wt%. Examples of such substances are solid suspending<br>
agents, such as one or more of starch, crosslinked polymers, gum agar, derivated<br>
cellulose like for example methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellolose and carboxy methylcellulose, silica, colloidal clays like for example<br>
chalk and bentonite, and/or one or more salts, oxides or hydroxides of metals like Al, Ca,<br>
Mg, Ba, Fe, Zn, Ni and Mn, for example one or more of calcium phosphate, calcium<br>
carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, barium sulphate, calcium oxalate, and hydroxides of<br>
aluminium, iron, zinc, nickel or manganese. If present, these solid suspending agents are<br>
normally mainly located to the outer surface of the polymer shell. However, even if a<br>
suspending agent has been added during the production of the microspheres, this may<br>
have been washed off at a later stage and could thus be substantially absent from the<br>
final product.<br>
The expandable microspheres preferably have a volume median diameter from 1<br>
to 500 urn, more preferably from 5 to 100 urn, most preferably from 10 to 50 urn. The<br>
amount of propellant in the expandable microspheres is preferably from 5 to 50 wt%,<br>
more preferably from 10 to 50 wt%, most preferably from 15 to 40 wt%, particularly most<br>
preferably from 20 to 35 wt%.<br>
The term expandable microspheres as used herein refers to expandable<br>
microspheres that have not previously been expanded, i.e. unexpanded expandable<br>
microspheres.<br>
A further aspect of the invention concerns a process for the production of<br>
expandable thermoplastic microspheres as described above. The process comprises<br>
polymerising ethylenically unsaturated monomers as described above in a preferably<br>
aqueous suspension in the presence of a propellant to yield microspheres comprising a<br>
polymer shell encapsulating said propellant. Regarding the kinds and amounts of<br>
monomers and propellant, the above description of the expandable microspheres is<br>
referred to. The production may follow the same principles as described in the earlier<br>
mentioned US Patents 3615972, 3945956, 4287308, 5536756, 6235800, 6235394 and<br>
6509384, US Patent Applications Publications US 2004/0176486 and 2005/0079352, GB<br>
1024195, EP 486080, EP 1288272, WO 2004/072160 and JP Laid Open No. 1987-<br>
286534, 2005-213379 and 2005-272633.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the microspheres are produced in a batchwise<br>
process and the polymerisation may then be conducted as described below in a reaction<br>
vessel. For 100 parts of monomer phase (suitably including monomers and propellant,<br>
the proportions of which determine proportions of monomers in the polymer shell and the<br>
amount of propellant in the final product), one or more polymerisation initiator, preferably<br>
in an amount from 0.1 to 5 parts, aqueous phase, preferably in an amount from 100 to<br>
800 parts, and one or more preferably solid colloidal suspending agent, preferably in an<br>
amount from 1 to 20 parts, are mixed and homogenised. The size of the droplets of the<br>
monomer phase obtained determines the size of the final expandable microspheres in<br>
accordance with the principles described in e.g. US Patent 3615972, that can be applied<br>
for all similar production methods with various suspending agents. The temperature is<br>
suitably maintained from 40 to 90°C, preferably from 50 to 80°C, while the suitable pH<br>
depends on the suspending agent used. For example, a high pH, preferably from 5 to 12,<br>
most preferably from 6 to 10, is suitable if the suspending agent is selected from salts,<br>
oxides or hydroxides of metals like Ca, Mg, Ba, Zn, Ni and Mn, for example one or more<br>
of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide,<br>
barium sulphate, calcium oxalate, and hydroxides of zinc, nickel or manganese. A low<br>
pH, preferably from 1 to 6, most preferably from 3 to 5, is suitable if the suspending agent<br>
is selected from starch, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, carboxy methylcellulose, gum agar, silica, colloidal clays, or oxide or<br>
hydroxide of aluminium or iron. Each one of the above agents has different optimal pH,<br>
depending on, for example, solubility data.<br>
In order to enhance the effect of the suspending agent, it is also possible to add<br>
small amounts of one or more promoters, for example from 0.001 to 1 wt%. Usually, such<br>
promoters are organic materials and may, for example, be selected from one or more of<br>
water-soluble sulfonated'polystyrenes, alginates, carboxymethylcellulose, tetramethyl<br>
ammonium hydroxide or chloride or water-soluble complex resinous amine condensation<br>
products such as the water-soluble condensation products of diethanolamine and adipic<br>
acid, the water-soluble condensation products of ethylene oxide, urea and formaldehyde,<br>
polyethylenimine, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylamine, amphoteric<br>
materials such as proteinaceous, materials like gelatin, glue, casein, albumin, glutin and<br>
the like, non-ionic materials like methoxycellulose, ionic materials normally classed as<br>
emulsifiers, such as soaps, alkyl sulfates and sulfonates and long chain quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds.<br>
Conventional radical polymerisation may be used and initiators are suitably<br>
selected from one or more of organic peroxides such as dialkyl peroxides, diacyl<br>
peroxides, peroxy esters, peroxy dicarbonates, or azo compounds. Suitable initiators<br><br>
include dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, di(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate,<br>
dioctanoyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, didecanoyl peroxide, tert-<br>
butyl peracetate, tert-butyl perlaurate, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide,<br>
cumene hydroperoxide, cumene ethylperoxide, diisopropylhydroxy dicarboxylate, 2,2'-<br>
azobis(2,4-dimethyl valeronitrile), 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile), 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexane-1-<br>
carbonitrile), dimethyl 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionate), 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)propionamide] and the like. It is also possible to initiate the polymerisation<br>
with radiation, such as high energy ionising radiation.<br>
When the polymerisation is essentially complete, microspheres are normally<br>
obtained as an aqueous slurry or dispersion, which can be used as such or dewatered by<br>
any conventional means, such as bed filtering, filter pressing, leaf filtering, rotary filtering,<br>
belt filtering or centrifuging to obtain a so called wet cake. However, it is also possible to<br>
dry the microspheres by any conventional means, such as spray drying, shelf drying,<br>
tunnel drying, rotary drying, drum drying, pneumatic drying, turbo shelf drying, disc drying<br>
orfluidised bed-drying.<br>
If appropriate, the microspheres may at any stage be treated to reduce the<br>
amount of residual unreacted monomers, for example by any of the procedures described<br>
in the earlier mentioned WO 2004/072160 or US 4287308.<br>
A further aspect of the invention concerns expanded microspheres obtained by<br>
expanding expandable microspheres as described above, for example to a particle<br>
diameter from 2 to 5 times larger than the diameter of the unexpanded microspheres. The<br>
density of the expanded microspheres may, for example, be from 0.005 to 0.06 g/cm3.<br>
The expansion is effected by heating the expandable microspheres to a temperature<br>
above Tstart. The upper temperature limit is set by when the microspheres start collapsing<br>
and depends on the exact composition of the polymer shell and the propellant. In most<br>
cases a temperature from 80°C to 150°C is suitable. The density of the expanded<br>
microspheres can be controlled by selecting temperature and time for the heating. The<br>
expansion can be effected by any suitable means for heating in any suitable device, as<br>
described in e.g. EP 0348372, WO 004/056549 or WO 2006/009643.<br>
The expandable and expanded microspheres of the invention are useful in<br>
various application such as paper making, printing inks (such as waterborne inks, solvent<br>
borne inks, plastisols, UV-curing inks etc. e.g. for textile, wall paper etc.), putties,<br>
sealants, toy-clays, underbody coatings, adhesives, debonding of adhesives, artificial<br>
leather, genuine leather, paint, non-woven materials, paper and board, coatings (e.g anti-<br>
slip coating etc.) for various materials such as paper, board, plastics, metals and textile,<br>
explosives, cable insulations, thermoplastics (such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
and ethylene-vinylacetate) or thermoplastic elastomers (such as styrene-ethylene-<br><br>
butylene-styrene co-polymer, styrene-butadiene-styrene co-polymer, thermoplastic<br>
polyurethanes and thermoplastic polyolefins), styrene-butadiene rubber, natural rubber,<br>
vulcanized rubber, silicone rubbers, thermosetting polymers (such as epoxies,<br>
polyurethanes and polyesters). In some of these applications expanded microspheres are<br>
particularly advantageous, such as in putties, sealants, toy-clays, genuine leather, paint,<br>
explosives, cable insulations and thermosetting polymers (like epoxies, polyurethanes<br>
and polyesters). In some cases it is also possible to use a mixture of expanded and<br>
expandable microspheres of the invention, for example in underbody coatings, silicone<br>
rubbers and light weight foams.<br>
Still a further aspect of the invention concerns an aqueous slurry comprising<br>
expandable thermoplastic microspheres as described above, preferably in an amount<br>
from 5 to 55 wt%, most preferably from 20 to 55 wt%. Such a slurry is useful for various<br>
applications of the expandable microspheres, including e.g. paper making. The slurry<br>
preferably also comprises at least one thickener, preferably compatible with paper<br>
making. Examples of such thickeners include at least partially water soluble polymers<br>
selected from the group consisting of starch, gums, celluloses, chitins, chitosans, glycans,<br>
galactans, pectins, mannans, dextrins, co-polymers made from monomers comprising<br>
acrylic acid or salts thereof (preferably up to 50 mol%, most preferably up to 20 mol%<br>
acrylic acid or salt thereof), homo- and co-polymers made from monomers comprising<br>
esters or amides of acrylic acid, homo and co-polymers made from monomers comprising<br>
methacrylic acid, esters or amides thereof, rubber latexes, polyvinyl chloride) and<br>
copolymers, polyvinyl esters) and co-polymers (e.g. with ethylene), polyvinyl alcohol),<br>
polyamines, polyetyleneimine, polyethylene/ polypropylene oxides, polyurethane, and<br>
aminoplast and phenoplast precondensates such as urea/ formaldehyde, urea/<br>
melamine/ formaldehyde or phenol/ formaldehyde and polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin<br>
resins. Examples of suitable gums include guar gums, tamarind gums, locust bean gums,<br>
tare gums, karaya, okra, acacia, xanthan gums etc. and mixtures thereof, of which guar<br>
gums are particularly preferred. Examples of suitable celluloses include derivatives such<br>
as optionally chemically modified CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) and cellulose ethers like<br>
EHEC (ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose) and HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose), and mixtures<br>
thereof. Chemically modified cellulose derivatives include, for example, those modified<br>
with various functional groups such as quaternary amines, other amines, sulphates,<br>
sulphonates, phosphates, phosphonates, polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide.<br>
The at least partially water soluble polymer can be straight chained, branched or<br>
cross-linked. The average molecular weight can vary within wide limits, depending on the<br>
kind of polymer. In most cases the preferred average molecular weight is at least 500,<br>
more preferably at least 2000 and most preferably at least 5000. The upper limit is not<br><br>
critical and in most cases the average molecular weight is preferably up to 50 000 000,<br>
more preferably up to 10 000 000, most preferably up to 1 000 000.<br>
Particularly preferred polymers include starch, CMC, EHEC, Guar gum,<br>
polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin resins, co-polymers of acrylic acid with other monomers<br>
(e.g. with acrylamide), and homo- or co-polymers of polyacrylamides, polyamine,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol) and polyethylene/ polypropylene oxides.<br>
One or more at least partially water soluble polymers effective as thickener are<br>
preferably present in an amount to stabilise the slurry against substantial sedimentation<br>
or flotation of the microspheres to an extent that they cannot be re-dispersed again. In<br>
many cases this can be achieved by adding sufficient polymer to obtain a preferred<br>
viscosity of the slurry from about 150 to about 1000 mPas at 25°C, most preferably from<br>
about 200 to about 600 mPas at 25°C (refers to measurement with an Anton Paar DV-1P<br>
viscosimeter equipped with a spindle L3). The amount required to stabilise the slurry<br>
depends on the polymer and other circumstances such as the pH. In many cases a<br>
preferred content of at least partially water soluble polymer in the slurry is from about 0.1<br>
to about 15 wt%, most preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 wt%, particularly most<br>
preferably from about 0.5 to about 10 wt%.<br>
All thickeners and other additives disclosed in any of the earlier mentioned WO<br>
2006/068573 and WO 2006/068574 may be used in the aqueous slurry of the invention in<br>
the preferred amounts also disclosed therein.<br>
Particular aspects of the invention relates to the use of expandable microspheres<br>
as described above in printing inks, , artificial leather, nonwoven and in the production of<br>
paper, particularly from a stock containing cellulosic fibres. A further aspect relates to the<br>
use of expanded microspheres as described above in the production of paper.<br>
When used in printing inks, in particular water borne printing inks, the<br>
expandable microspheres, preferably wet unexpanded microspheres, are added to<br>
standard formulations well known to those skilled in the art. Such formulations usually<br>
include one or more binders and one or more thickeners. Other components may include,<br>
for example, pigments, anti-foaming agents, fillers, chemicals for preventing skinning or<br>
clogging, etc. Printing inks may also be based on acrylate dispersions or plastisols<br>
comprising expandable microspheres. After printing, the microspheres are expanded by<br>
heating, before, during or after the drying of the ink. Such printing inks are particularly<br>
suitable for printing on textiles or wallpaper.<br>
When used in artificial leather, the expandable microspheres, preferably dry<br>
unexpanded microspheres, are used in standard formulations in standard procedures<br>
known by those skilled in the art, for example in the surface layer of multilayer artificial<br>
leather, for example of suede type or any other kind of structure. The artificial leather can<br><br>
be produced by any standard process, such as Release paper process, Direct coating of<br>
woven or non-woven, or the Coagulation process, from any standard material such<br>
polyurethane (PU), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and mixtures thereof. Usually, artificial<br>
leather produced by any of the above processes is coated with PU or PVC paste<br>
containing expandable microspheres and is then heated to expand the microspheres.<br>
Production of nonwoven may comprise the steps of forming a web of fibres, adding<br>
to said web a binder and expandable microspheres as described above, and forming<br>
nonwoven and applying heat to raise the temperature of the microspheres sufficiently for<br>
them to expand and thereby increase the bulk nonwoven. The expandable microspheres<br>
and the binder may be added separately or as a mixture. The amount of expandable<br>
microspheres added is preferably from about 0.1 to about 30 wt% of dried product, most<br>
preferably from about 0.5 to about 15 wt% of dried product. The amount of binder added is<br>
preferably from about 10 to about 90 wt% of dried product, most preferably from about 20 to<br>
about 80 wt% of dried product. Further details can be found in the previously mentioned WO<br>
2004/113613.<br>
In production of paper the expandable microspheres are preferably used to<br>
increase the bulk of the paper, but may also serve other purposes. The microspheres are<br>
then preferably added to a stock containing cellulosic fibres, which then is dewatered and<br>
dried, wherein the microspheres expand and contribute to increasing the bulk of the<br>
paper.<br>
A special aspect of the invention relates to a process for the production of paper<br>
comprising the steps of adding thermally expandable microspheres as described above<br>
to a stock containing cellulosic fibres, dewatering the stock on a wire to obtain paper, and<br>
drying the paper by applying heat and thereby also raising the temperature of the<br>
microspheres sufficiently for them to expand and increase the bulk of the paper.<br>
The amount of expandable microspheres added to the stock is preferably from<br>
0.1 to 20 wt%, most preferably from 0.2 to 10 wt% dry microspheres of the dry content in<br>
the stock. Any kind of paper machine known in the art can be used.<br>
The term "paper", as used herein, is meant to include all types of cellulose-based<br>
products in sheet or web form, including, for example, board, cardboard and paper board.<br>
The invention has been found particularly advantageous for the production of board,<br>
cardboard and paper board, particularly with a basis weight from 50 to 1000 g/m2, preferably<br>
from 150 to 800 g/m2.<br>
The paper may be produced as a single layer or a multi-layer paper. If the paper<br>
comprises three or more layers, the expandable microspheres may be added to the portions<br>
of the stock forming one or several of these layers, for example only to the portions of the<br>
stock not forming any of the two outer layers.<br><br>
The stock preferably contains from 50 to 100 wt%, most preferably from 70 to 100<br>
wt% of cellulosic fibres, based on dry material. Before dewatering, the stock besides<br>
expandable microspheres, may also contain one or more fillers, e.g. mineral fillers like<br>
kaolin, china clay, titanium dioxide, gypsum, talc, chalk, ground marble or precipitated<br>
calcium carbonate, and optionally other commonly used additives, such as retention aids,<br>
sizing agents, aluminium compounds, dyes, wet-strength resins, optical brightening agents,<br>
etc. Examples of aluminium compounds include alum, aluminates and polyaluminium<br>
compounds, e.g. polyaluminium chlorides and sulphates. Examples of retention aids include<br>
cationic polymers, anionic inorganic materials in combination with organic polymers, e.g.<br>
bentonite in combination with cationic polymers or silica-based sols in combination with<br>
cationic polymers or cationic and anionic polymers. Examples of sizing agents include<br>
cellulose reactive sizes such as alkyl ketene dimers and alkenyl succinic anhydride, and<br>
cellulose non-reactive sizes such as rosin, starch and other polymeric sizes like<br>
copolymers of styrene with vinyl monomers such as maleic anhydride, acrylic acid and its<br>
alkyl esters, acrylamide, etc.<br>
At drying, the paper, and thereby also the microspheres, is preferably heated to<br>
a temperature from 50 to 150°C, most preferably from 60 to 110°C. This results in<br>
expansion of the microspheres and thereby also a bulk increase of the paper. The<br>
magnitude of this bulk increase depends on various factors, such as the origin of<br>
cellulosic fibres and other components in the stock, but is in most cases from 5 to 70 % or<br>
more per weight percentage of retained microspheres in the dried paper, compared to the<br>
same kind of paper produced without addition of expandable microspheres or any other<br>
expansion agent. Any conventional means of drying involving transferring heat to the<br>
paper can be applied, such as contact drying (e.g. by heated cylinders), forced<br>
convection drying (e.g. by hot air), infrared techniques, or combinations thereof. In the<br>
case of contact drying, the temperature of the contact surfaces, e.g. the cylinders, is<br>
preferably from 20 to 150°C, most preferably from 30 to 130°C. The paper may pass a<br>
series of several cylinders, e.g. up to 20 or more, of increasing temperature. The paper<br>
may then undergo any kind of conventional treatment such as surface sizing, coating,<br>
calendering and the like.<br>
The cellulosic fibres in the stock may, for example, come from pulp made from any<br>
kind of plants, preferably wood, such as hardwood and softwood. The cellulosic fibres may<br>
also partly or fully originate from recycled paper, in which case the invention has been found<br>
to give unexpectedly good results.<br>
The expandable microspheres can be added in any form, although it from a<br>
practical point of view is most preferred to add them in the form of an aqueous slurry as<br>
described above.<br><br>
A further aspect of the invention concerns paper comprising expanded<br>
microspheres obtained from expandable microspheres as earlier described. The paper<br>
may further comprise cellulosic fibres and other conventional components. The<br>
microspheres may have been expanded in the process for the production of the paper as<br>
described above or been expanded separately and then added to the stock containing<br>
cellulosic fibres from which the paper is produced.<br>
The invention will be further described in connection with the following Examples<br>
which, however, are not to be interpreted to limit the scope of the invention. If not<br>
otherwise stated, all parts and percentages refer to parts and percent by weight.<br>

otherwise stated, all parts and percentages refer to parts and percent by weight.<br>
The expansion properties of the microspheres were evaluated on a Mettler TMA<br>
40 with a TC15 TA processor and a PC with STAR8 software using a heating rate of 20°C<br>
/ min and a load (net.) of 0.06 N. Tstat is the temperature at which the expansion starts,<br>
Tmax is the temperature at which maximum expansion is obtained and TMA-density is the<br>
density of the microspheres at Tmax.<br>
The particle size and size distribution was determined by laser light scattering on<br>
a Malvern Mastersizer Hydro 2000 SM apparatus on wet samples. The mean particle size<br>
is presented as the volume median diameter d(0.5).<br>
The amount of propellant was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)<br>
on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e. All samples were dried prior to analysis in order to<br>
exclude as much moisture as possible and if present also residual monomers. The<br>
analyses were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen using a heating rate at 20°C<br>
min"1 starting at 30°C.<br>
Example 1: A reaction mixture containing Mg(OH)2-stabilised organic droplets in<br>
water was created by mixing the phases and stirring vigorously until a suitable droplet<br>
size had been achieved. The water dispersion contained 2.2 parts of Mg(OH)2 and 332<br>
parts of water. The organic droplets contained 2 parts of dilauroylperoxide, 38 parts of<br>
isobutane, 52 parts of acrylonitrile, 28 parts of methacrylonitrile, 20 parts of ethyl vinyl<br>
ether and 0.3 parts of trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. Polymerisation was performed<br>
at 62°C in a sealed reactor under agitation. After cooling to room temperature a sample of<br>
the obtained microsphere slurry was removed for determination of the particle size<br>
distribution. After filtration, washing and drying the particles were analysed by TMA. The<br>
dry particles contained about 23% by weight of isobutane and had a mean particle size of<br>
about 25 urn. The TMA-results are found in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Examples 2-30: Microspheres were prepared in a plurality of polymerisation<br>
experiments performed as in Example 1 except for monomers and propellants, which<br>
were added according to Table 1. As crosslinking monomer 0.3-1 parts of<br>
trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (Examples 2-10 and 17-30) or di(ethylene glycol)<br>
dimethacrylate (Examples 11-16) was used and as initiator 2.0-2.5 parts of<br>
dilauroylperoxide was used. In Examples 17 and 18 the propellants were 38 parts of n-<br>
butane and a mixture of propane and n-butane (14/86 w/w), respectively.The amounts of<br>
water and Mg(OH)2 in the examples varied between 251-332 parts and 2.2-4.8 parts<br>
respectively. This is due to small differences in the recipes in different, polymerisation<br>
reactors but does not influence the thermal properties of the polymerised particles.<br>
Polymerisation was performed at 61-62°C as described in Example 1. In Example 2, prior<br>
to handling the particles outside the reactor, the amount of residual monomers was<br>
reduced by treatment with 2.1 parts NaHSO3 for 4 hrs at 73°C, after which the<br>
temperature was lowered to room temperature and the particles were isolated and<br>
analysed. In Examples 22 and 23 the product contained high amounts of unreacted<br>
monomers and the samples were difficult to analyze. The dry particles from Examples 30<br>
contained a low amount of propellant, probably due to leakage during drying of the<br>
particles. Analytical results can be found in Table 1.<br>
Examples 31-32: Microspheres were prepared as in Example 1 except for<br>
monomers and propellants, which were added according to Table 1, and stabilizing the<br>
organic droplets by using a water dispersion of silica instead of Mg(OH)2. The water<br>
dispersion was prepared by mixing 252 parts of water, 11 parts of 1M NaOH, 19 parts of<br>
10% acetic acid, 0.3 parts of Cr(NO3)3, 10 parts of 40% colloidal silica, 0.6 parts of a<br>
condensation product of diethanolamine and adipic acid. After cooling to room<br>
temperature a sample of the obtained microsphere slurry was removed for determination<br>
of the particle size distribution. After filtration, washing and drying the particles were<br>
analysed by TMA. Analytical results can be found in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 33-38: Microspheres were prepared in a plurality of polymerisation<br>
experiments performed as in Example 1 except for monomers and propellants, which<br>
were added according to Table 2. The amounts of water in the examples varied between<br>
320-332 parts. This is due to small differences in the recipes in different polymerisation<br>
reactors but does not influence the thermal properties of the polymerised particles.<br>
Analytical results can be found in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Examples 39-43: Microspheres were prepared in a plurality of polymerisation<br>
experiments performed as in Example 1 except for monomers and propellants, which<br>
were added according to Table 3. In Examples 39-40 and 43, 1 part of the crosslinking<br>
monomer, di(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate was used, while in Examples 41-42 no<br>
crosslinking monomer other than BDVE was used. As initiator 2.0-2.5 parts of<br>
dilauroylperoxide was used. The amounts of water and Mg(OH)2 in the examples varied<br>
between 251-332 parts and 2.1-4.8 parts respectively. This is due to small differences in<br>
the recipes in different polymerisation reactors but does not influence the thermal<br>
properties of the polymerised particles. Polymerisation was performed at 61-62°C as<br>
described in Example 1.,As can be seen in Table 3, when using 1,4-butanediol divinyl<br>
ether as monomer the particles show poor or no expansion compared to e.g. Example 4<br>
and 12 in Table 1.<br><br><br>
73.9 parts of vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer dispersion binder (Mowilith DM-107 from<br>
Celanese, 60% dry weight), 66.3 parts of methyl methacrylate-ethyl acrylate copolymer<br>
emulsion binder (Primal ECO-16 from Rohm and Haas, 45.5% dry weight), 10.0 parts of<br>
glycerol, 0.8 parts of a mineral oil based defoamer (Nopco ENA-515 from Cognis) and<br>
29.9 parts of water, using a Silverson mixer. Then 3.0 parts of an acrylic polymer<br>
dispersion thickening agent (Alcoprint PT-XN from Ciba) was added, followed by further<br>
mixing with a dissolver mixer until thickening was complete and a smooth mixture was<br>
obtained. This resulted in a print containing 12% by dry weight of microspheres. Screen<br>
prints were made which were dried over night at room temperature. Then the thickness of<br>
the unexpanded prints were measured with a coating thickness gauge (Elcometer 355<br>
Standard) and was found to be 40 urn. The prints were expanded for 60 sec at 90 -<br>
160°C in a Mathis labdryer hot air oven. The thickness of the expanded prints were<br>
measured and the expansion factors were calculated by dividing with the thickness of the<br>
unexpanded print. An expandable printing ink, created from commercially available<br>
microspheres having polymer shells of 58% vinylidene chloride, 33% acrylonitrile and 9%<br>
methyl methacrylate and having isobutane as propellant, was tested in the same way.<br>
The expansion factors are presented in Table 3.<br><br>
The results show that the expansion factor of the ink from the chlorine-free microsphere<br>
of the invention are higher compared to the expansion factors from the chlorine<br>
containing microspheres, especially in the region between 110-150°C.<br>
Example 45: A single layer paper board with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2<br>
was produced on a pilot paper machine with a machine speed of about 4 m/min and not<br>
having recirculated process water. The pulp was composed of 42.5 wt% hardwood, 42.5<br>
wt% softwood pulp and 15.0% filler (GCC) and was beaten to a Schopper-Riegler value<br>
of 28°SR and then dispersed to give a pulp slurry/stock. An aqueous slurry of expandable<br><br>
microspheres was added to the stock before the mixing box in an amount of about 2.0<br>
wt% dry microspheres of the dry substance in the stock. As retention aid Compozil® (Eka<br>
Chemicals) was used and AKD was used as sizing agent. In the drying section the paper<br>
web was heated by cylinders having a temperature profile from 70 to 120°C. Expandable<br>
microspheres from Example 2 were tested. Commercially available microsphere slurries,<br>
with microspheres having a polymer shell of 73% vinylidene chloride, 24% acrylonitrile<br>
and 3% methyl methacrylate and having isobutane as propellant, were tested as<br>
Reference microspheres. Starch (Solvitose C5™ from Avebe Starches North Europe)<br>
was added as a thickening agent to the microsphere slurries to stabilise against flotation<br>
or sedimentation. In order to determine the retention of the microspheres, paper samples<br>
were taken before the press section for determination of the amount of microspheres.<br>
This was done by quantification of the amount of isobutane present in the paper by GC<br>
and from that the amount of microspheres was calculated. The retention was calculated<br>
from the microspheres addition and the content of microspheres in the paper. Moreover,<br>
samples from the dried paper were taken for determination of bulk and thickness. The<br>
results are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
The results show that the increase of the bulk of the paper from the chlorine-free<br>
microspheres of the invention is better compared to the increase of the bulk from the<br>
chlorine containing microspheres.<br><br>
