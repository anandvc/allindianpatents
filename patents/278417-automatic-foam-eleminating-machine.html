[DESCRIPTION]<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a foam eliminating device and more particularly   to   an   automatic   foam   eliminating   machine   used   in fermentation process. [Background Art]<br>
Nowadays, it is inevitable to generate masses of foam which will influence production severely if not eliminated during the production process in the field of biological aerobic fermentation such as citric acid, glutamate, lysine, enzyme preparation, antibiotics, etc. However, in real life, people usually use conventional ways of eliminating foam, i.e., using foam eliminating harrow and defoamer simultaneously. The disadvantage of the way mentioned above is: as to the foam eliminating harrow, raking-type scraper installed at the upper portion of the liquid level of the can shatters the big foam on the surface of the liquid level into small foam which can not be eliminated fully; in that case, we have to use chemical agents (e.g., defoamer or vegetable oil) to eliminate the foam again, which eliminate the foam with high cost and also pollute the environment. The utility model named "foam eliminating machine" (ZL 99247539.2)<br>
filled in 1999 is used in probation period by some factories in succession<br>
and its way of eliminating foam is driven by sterile compressed air and<br>
implemented by gasbag, straw, vane wheel and spiral. The mentioned<br>

 <br>
foam eliminating machine saves massed of defoamer, however, it needs long time to eliminate foam due to the limitation of the quality of straw and needs manual operation due to not equipped with self-control system that may cause trouble to production.<br>
[Contents of the invention]<br>
In view of the above-noted technical problems, the present invention provides an automatic foam eliminating machine used in fermentation process according to fluid dynamics, isokinetic spiral, air suction and jet principle.<br>
To achieve the purpose of the present invention, the automatic foam eliminating machine according to the present invention includes five spouts with different sizes of diameter. The spouts connect to one another, forming a flared spraying cavity shaped from small to wide, the smallest port is an air intake, and the widest port is a discharge jet. Four annulate foam suction ports are formed among the five spouts, and an annualte outer edge is located around each annulate foam suction port.<br>
There is a rear sucking pipe located on the wall of a certain spout.<br>
Wherein , the wall of spouts are connected through welding plate.<br>
There is isokinetic spiral configured in the smallest spout of the five spouts.<br>
The smallest spout is connected to a flange, which is used to connect a gas pipeline.<br>
There is a direction filter inserted in the widest spout close to the discharge jet.<br>
The outer edge is used to enhance negative pressure and the rear sucking pipe is used to balance airflow.<br>

 <br>
The present automatic foam eliminating machine can implement automatic control and further includes a self-control system which consists of a sensor, a foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve and a controller. One port of the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve is connected to a fermentation gas pipeline and the other port is connected to the annulate gas pipeline in a fermentation can. The annulate gas pipeline connects to the air intake; the sensor connects to the controller which is connected to the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve.<br>
After the fermentation can begins to run, the controller starts to work, the power switch is opened while the green work light runs to blink and shine indicating to-be-work status. When the foam in the fermentation can reaches a preset height, the self-control system monitors the foam and then emits signals to the controller. Then the controller starts the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve rapidly. At this point, the airflow with certain pressure enters into the foam eliminating machine through the annular gas pipeline and the foam eliminating machine starts to eliminate the foam and then red work light shines indicating the foam eliminating machine begins to work. At that time, the readings of the flow meter in exhaust pipeline will raise slowly; when the foam is eliminated completely, the foam eliminating machine will stop working automatically, the red work light will be off, the readings of the flow meter will return to the initial status. The controller will stop working and the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve will be closed. When the foam surges again for the next time, the automatic foam eliminating machine will work again, the process will be repeated in cycle.<br>
The self-control system can further include a spare Polyether electromagnetic valve as a spare security system, whose one port is<br>

 <br>
connected to a Polyether pipe and the other is connected to the annulate gas pipeline. When fermentation liquid behaves abnormally, i.e., the conditions of liquid-escape and run-tank occur, the controller will start the spare foam-enemy electromagnetic valve and the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve simultaneously, and then eliminate the foam together through the spraying of the foam eliminating machine and the Polyether, which effectively prevents the condition of run-tank from happening.<br>
The automatic foam eliminating machine of the present invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	it can save defoamer by more than 80%, which brings rather considerable economic benefits;<br>
2.	it can increase the capacity of the can by 1% to 3%, which enhances the yield per unit;<br>
3.	it can decrease the discharge of hazardous substances, which improves environmental benefits and reduce the encroachment to human body caused by chemical eliminating foam agents at the same time.<br>
4.	it can decrease the viscosity of liquid, which benefits the process of distilling;<br>
5.	it can completely implement automatic control, which avoids much inconvenience and loss caused by manual operation.<br>

[Mode of Carrying out the Invention]<br>
The following embodiments are used to describe the present invention , but not to limit the extent of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrates the structure of the automatic foam eliminating machine of this present invention; Fig. 2 is the section view of Fig 1. As shown in FIG. 1 and 2, the automatic foam eliminating machine of the present invention comprises five spouts. Spout 1 connects to spout 2, spout 2 connects to spout 3, spout 3 connects to spout 4, and spout 4 connects to spout 5. The five spouts with different sizes of diameter connect to one another, forming a flared spraying cavity shaped from small to wide, the smallest port (i.e., one port of spout 1) is an air intake 11, and the widest port (i.e., one port of spout 5) is a discharge jet 13. Four annulate foam suction ports 9 are formed among the five spouts, and an annulate outer edge 8 is located around each anuulate foam suction port 9 to enhance negative pressure. There is a rear sucking pipe 10 located on the wall of spout 2 to balance airflow.<br>
The walls of the spouts connect to one another through welding plate 7.<br>
There is isokinetic spire 31 configured in one port of the flared spraying cavity, i.e., the smallest spout 1, as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
There is direction filter 6 inserted in spout 5 close to discharge jet 13, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Flange 12 is welded on spout 1, which is used to connect a gas pipeline.<br>
The foam eliminating machine is connected with five spouts (spouts 1 to 5), forming a spraying cavity shaped from small to wide. After the self-control system is provided with gas, the gas with certain pressure<br>
7<br>
1 6 APR 2009<br>
 <br>
from air intake llenters into spout 1 through flange 12, flows along the gap of isokinetic spire 31, shoots aimed at the spraying cavity and then at direction filter 6 and finally sprays out from spout 13. At this point, a negative pressure area is formed around the foam eliminating machine by the enhanced negative pressure of annulate outer edge 8, and then masses of foam in fermentation can 33 is rapidly sucked into the spraying cavity from annulate foam suction port 9 under the action of the negative pressure. Under the action of strong airflow and isokinetic spiral 31 as well as direction filter 6, the foam is shattered and atomized and then sprayed from spout 13 along the direction of airflow to revert into liquid. Finally air is discharged outside the can along an exhaust pipeline. Fig. 6 is a status diagram before the automatic foam eliminating machine of the present invention works; Fig. 7 is a status diagram after the automatic foam eliminating machine of the present invention works. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the foam is eliminated after working.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the self-control system consists of sensor 29, foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve 30, spare Polyether electromagnetic valve and controller 20. One port of foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve 30 connects to fermentation gas pipeline 27 and the other connects to annulate gas pipeline 26 in fermentation can 33. The flange on annulate gas pipeline 26 connects to air intake 11 (see FIG. 11) of foam eliminating mechine 25.<br>
After fermentation can 33(Fig. 6 and 7) begins to run, controller 20 includes power supply 21, green work light 22, red work light 23 and display 24. Controller 20 (see Fig. 5) begins to work, the switch of power supply 21 of the self-control system is opened while the green work light 22 runs to blink and shine indicating to-be-work status. When the foam in<br>
8<br>
1 6 APR 2009<br>
 <br>
the fermentation can 33 reaches a preset height, the self-control system 29 monitors the foam and then emits signals to the controller 20. Then the controller 20 starts the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve rapidly 30. At this point, the airflow with certain pressure enters into the foam eliminating machine 25 through the annulate gas pipeline 26 and the foam eliminating machine starts to eliminate the foam and then red work light 23 shines indicatinig the foam eliminating machine 25 begins to work. At that time, the readings of flow meter in exhaust pipeline 28 will raise slowly; when the foam is eliminated completely, the foam eliminating machine 25 will stop working automatically, the red work light 23 will be off, the readings of the flow meter will return to the initial status. The controller will stop working and the foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve 30 will be closed. When the foam surges again for the next time, the automatic foam eliminating machine 25 will work again, the process will be repeated in cycle.<br>
Spare Polyether electromagnetic valve 32 is a spare security system, whose one port is connected to a foam-enemy pipe and the other is connected to annulate gas pipeline 26. When fermentation liquid behaves abnormally, i.e., the conditions of liquid-escape and run-tank occur, the controller will start spare Polyether electromagnetic valve 32 and foam eliminating air electromagnetic valve 30 simultaneously, and then eliminate the foam together through the spraying of foam eliminting machine 25 and the Polyether. The way of eliminating foam effectively prevents the condition of run-tank from happening.<br>
Although the present invention has been described herein with reference to particular exemplary embodiments, certain alterations and modifications may be apparent to those skilled in the art, without<br>
