3 PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly descibes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
27NOV 2006<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for producing constrained angular motion and, in particular, to a system for precision angular motion mechanism for alignment and positioning of optical elements using a selective combination of turning pair-screw pair and self aligning ball-bearing. The system is specifically adapted for use in precision angular motion mechanism when the output is monitored (photon detectors or interference patterns) such as monochromators in hard X-ray and positioning devices in various visible optical setups. The system is also adapted for angular positioning of optical elements when it is calibrated, also in miniature and large angular stages with fine resolutions in different mechanical applications. The invention also relates to a small sized translation stage involving micrometer head such that the combination of the angular and translation stages is small sized, having good resolution and range and is less weight and cost effective. The system is compact, user-friendly and also cost-effective for wide scale use /application<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The provision of mechanism for use in angular positioning of optical elements is well known. Conventional devices and mechanisms known for such angular positioning of optical elements include:<br>
Worm and gear driven goniometers, which produce fine resolutions when worm rotates a gear. Gear ratio determines the magnitude of such resolution. Many commercial designs, which work on this principle are also available. (Foundations of mechanical accuracy Moore special tool company, Library of Congress Catalogue No. - 73-127307)<br>
Micrometers used push an extended rod in swivel stages having arc shaped crossed roller guide to produce constraint angular motion is also known. Such system is commercially made available by M/s Kohzu Precision Company Limited Item No. -ST05A-SIT and the complete series.<br>
2<br><br>
Standard sine-bar mechanism and its applications are also known wherein micrometer pushes a sine-bar to produce angle. Tiwari M.K., Gowri Sankar B., Raghuvanshi V.K., Nandedkar R.V. and Sawhney KJ.S. "Development of total reflection X-ray fluorescent spectrometer for ultra trace analysis Bull Mater. Sci. Vol 25 No. 5, October 2002, pp435-441.<br>
It is also known in the art to provide variety of mirror tilt mounts using screws and spring force.<br>
US 3814365 disclose an adjustable mount for rotatably orienting a structure such as an optical element, about two orthogonal axes comprising first and second orthogonal cross-spring pivots and respectively associated first and second coarse fine adjustment mechanism. Each cross spring pivots includes a first member and a second member which is rotatable relative to the first member, these two members being connected by first and second interleaved flat leaf springs which intersects along the respective axes of rotation. Application of a torque of a second member, which has the optical element, mounted thereon, causes rotation thereof relative to the first member about the axis of rotation. Utilizing at least five interleaved spring portions provide substantially improved mechanical stability.<br>
US 5019837 discloses a mirror mounting structure with low thermal drift which is enabled by providing a mirror mounting structure which vertically and/or horizontally aligns the mirror by providing two point forces against the mirror holding structure. The mirror holding arm is connected to a thick more rigid arm by resilient narrow slightly flexible neck portion. Screws threaded through the large arm contact alignment points on the mirror mount portion and permit accurate alignment in a desired plane. Thermal drift and hysteresis is minimized since the alignment forces are acting upon the mirror mount portion in the same direction and minimize the deviations caused by thermal expansion.<br>
It is also known to achieve angular positioning of optical elements by way of three point adjustments using screws. One of the screws is rotated to get the desired tilt. Likewise four point adjustments are also proposed in the art.<br>
3<br><br>
While the above state of the art reveal the knowledge prevailing in the art on the provision of variety of devices / mechanisms for angular positioning of optical elements, however, such known mechanisms /devices are found to have some inherent limitation/drawbacks. The drawbacks associated with the known systems include the following:<br>
i)	Construction of precise goniometer requires accurate fabrication of worm<br>
and gears. The processes thus require special purpose machines and metrology. Such factors usually tend to increase the cost of the optical positioning device.<br>
ii) The Micrometer push driven stages which is provided with arc shaped cross roller guides have less range of ~±3°.<br>
iii) It is also known to use inexpensive alternative to goniometer by use of precise linear drives (such as Micrometer head) and convert it into angular motion. In the same principle sine-bar mechanism also works. Importantly while the sine-bar mechanism can also be efficiently used for precise motions, but such mechanism involves spring loading or gravity returns and is found to be not stable when mounted on other parts rotating about horizontal axis.<br>
iv) Importantly it is found that various springs used in optical tilt mounts cause problems in stable optics especially when these mounts are mounted on another rotating part of high precision system. Also angular adjustments introduce some linear variation of optical elements along with rotation because optical elements are mounted away from pivot (axis of rotation do not pass through the reflecting surface of optical elements). Similar problems persist in the US 3814365.<br>
v) Angular adjustments using two point forces using screws against resilient neck portion of the structure that allows elastic deformation is a design meant for stable mirror mounting with low thermal drift. This design does not provide continuous variation of angle with good resolution and range using a single input, which is a problem in using them as optical rotational stages.<br>
vi) Also three point and four point adjustable mechanisms usually do not provide completely constrained angular motion about a single axis. Also<br><br>
4<br><br>
angular   motion   is   found   to   cause   some   linear  displacement   of  optical elements.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a system for precision and constrained angular motion about single axis of rotation at any orientation using linear drives along with possible translation drive to preciously position the optical element involving independent linear and angular motions involving mechanism comprising selectively of turning pair, screw pair and self-aligning bearings without the need for spring returns.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for precision and constrained angular motion for alignment and positioning of optical elements comprising selectively features including fine resolution, good range and repeatability, self locking, less weight, small size and cost effective.<br>

A further object of the present invention is to provide precision angular motion mechanism for alignment and positioning of optical elements which can be carried out using linear drive and would favour stable angular positioning and alignment stages.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide constrained angular motion stages of different sizes depending upon the end use/application.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide a system for angular positioning and alignment for optical elements, which would be cost effective for constructing precision stages without the use of worm and gear.<br>

2 1 MAR 2007<br><br>
angular and translation stages is small sized, provide good resolution and range and is less weight and cost effective.<br>

Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 1 which provides schematic illustration of embodiment of the system for precision angular motion mechanism for alignment and positioning of optical elements involving a turning pair-screw pair and self aligning ball bearing wherein the system provides an open-ended micrometer clamp type mechanism.<br>
As illustrated in said figure the system basically involves linkage mechanism consisting of turning pair-screw pair and self-aligning bearing to achieve the precision angular motion required for alignment and positioning of optical elements. In particular, the pair between the fixed frame link (LI) and another link denoted as micrometer clamp (L2) is a turning pair, while micrometer head (L3) which is clamped in L2 provides the screw pair and the pair there between the micrometer head (L3) and the rotary shaft link (L4) is self aligning ball bearing for effective precision motion (successively the said pairs are between L1-L2; L2-L3 and L3-L4). The mechanism is completed with another properly constrained turning pair between frame (LI) and rotatable link (L4)<br>
The fixed frame link (LI) acts as a frame of the angular stage, the rotatable link (L4) carries a coarse positioning top adapted for mounting for optical elements, the link comprising micrometer head clamp (L2) holds the micrometer head while the micrometer head constitutes the further link (L3). Preferably the micrometer is selected to have a resolution of 10 Microns or better.<br>
Importantly the fixed frame link (LI) and the rotary link (L4) are adapted to have no limitation to hold either reflection optics such as monochromators or transmission optics. Transmission through the axis of the stage can also be achieved by provision of hollow path through the stages preferably involving selective bearings for such purpose. Since the link 1 is provided as a frame structure, it can be provided either in a single piece or in more than one pieces and screwed and joint together. The links comprising the frame (LI) and the rotary link (L4) is properly constrained preferably by use of bearings. For the purpose bearings can be selected from variety<br>
15<br>
21 MAR 2001<br><br>
of options with the primary object of constraining to avoid any coupled orientation. Preloaded bearings, assembly preloading or established precision assemble methods in optical stages are followed. Likewise the fixed frame link (LI) and the clamping link (L2) are also required to be properly constrained to achieve the desired precision angular motion, the micrometer head (L3) and the rotary link (L4) are assembled through self-aligning bearing.<br>
The assembling of micrometer head (L3), the clamping link (L2) and the rotary link (L4) are assembled such as not to give any linear movement (slip in assemble, creeping) other than provided by micrometer head. The self-aligning bearing is thus adapted to be prevented from sliding or linear movement. The micrometer should also be prevented from sliding at the assembling with the micrometer clamp (L2).<br>
The manner of assembling of the system to achieve the above is explained in greater detail in relation to accompanying figures 1A to 1H illustrate the operative components connecting the linkage mechanism used in the system comprising the fixed frame link (LI), rotatable link (L4), link (L2) to position the micrometer clamp or the link (L3) comprising the micrometer spindle.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying fig 1A, which illustrates by way of an exploded view the operative connection and components details of the open-ended micrometer clamp type system of the embodiment of figure 1. As shown in said figure the link (LI) is obtained of the frame (1), the rotary link (L2) comprising of rotary shaft (2) and bearings (8 &amp; 9) used between said frame (1) and the rotating link (2), a micrometer clamp/split type constituting the link (L2) while the micrometer head constitutes link (L3). As further apparent of said figure in order to achieve the desired constraining of the link between the micrometer head (6) and the rotary shaft (2), the micrometer head (6) is operatively connected to the WL" bracket (5) through the micrometer end connector (4) and the self aligning bearing (11) and the snap ring (12). Also for proper constraining and non-slip positioning of the micrometer head the micrometer clamp (3), and bearings (10) are used there between the frame and the micrometer clamp.<br><br>
16<br><br>
The above discussed assembling of components to achieve the desired constrained precision angular motion would be further apparent by way of the illustrated component configuration further detailed by way of accompanying figures 1C to 1H.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying Figure IF, which illustrates the assembly of fixed and rotatable links<br>
Reference is invited to Figure 1G, which illustrates the micrometer end connector used in the system of the invention. The said micrometer end connector is adapted such that it connects micrometer head and self-aligning bearing. Preferably, it is connected to the micrometer head with force fit and similarly it is connected to the inside diameter of self-aligning bearing with a force fit. Importantly, there should be no slip between micrometer head and the connector. Similarly there should be no slip between inside diameter of self-aligning bearing and connector. Alternatively, it is also possible that the connector be joined to the micrometer using any temporary or permanent joining methods such as welding, adhesives etc. Similarly it may be joined to bearing using adhesives or any other standard practice provided the required purpose is served.<br>
The end connector functions such that it transmits micrometer motion to the bearing without any slip. The diameter of the connector is selected to give a calculated pre load to the self-aligning bearing (a slight interference) by which the radial clearance of the bearing is reduced. This improves the performance (sensitivity) of the angular positioning stage.<br>
It is also possible that the micrometer head is directly connected to the bearing in the absence of end connector. But in such case the system does not include the favorable features of the end connector discussed above. Also any standard size of the suitably selected bearing and a standard micrometer head can be used if the end connector is used (because if the end connector is used it is not necessary that basic dimension of inside diameter of the bearing and out side diameter of the micrometer head are equal). This is not possible if the micrometer is directly connected to the bearing. The role of end connector in linear motion stage is also similar to its function in angular stage i.e. to transmit the micrometer feed to the inner race of bearing without slip. However in case of linear motion stage deep groove ball bearing can be used in place of self-aligning bearing.<br><br>
17<br><br>
The critical dimensions of the end connector depends on the inside diameter of the bearing and out side diameter of the micrometer head. However there is no restriction to use only a small sized bearing in comparison to out side diameter of the micrometer head. The bearing can be selected by considering other factors such as size of the stage, load-carrying capacity etc.<br>
Importantly, the above system achieves precision angular motion by way of a) selective properly constrained assembling of link (LI) and link (L4) whereby it is possible to achieve the required accuracy of angular motion about the rotating axis. Any improper assembling or excessive radial play causing coupled angular motion is effectively taken care of, b) the self aligning bearing is prevented from sliding or linear motion in its housing and also between end connector and inner race of bearing. The sliding between the micrometer clamp and the micrometer head is also prevented, c) the linkage mechanism as above is further adapted to support the reflection optics such as monochromators and also transmission through the axis of angular stage.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figures 2A to 2C which illustrate in greater detail the manner of achieving the turning pair, screw pair and self aligning bearing to produce the constrain angular motion.<br>
As apparent from figure 2A the mechanism of operation of the system for precision angular motion of the invention involving the operative linking mechanism of the fixed frame link (LI), the micrometer clamp link (L2), micrometer spindle link (L3) and rotary link (L4) are all illustrated in said figure. Importantly the manner of providing for the turning pair is represented by PI and P2 while the screw pair is represented by P3 and the self aligning bearing provision by P4.<br>
Further the relation between geometry and the mechanism of action to achieve the precision angular motion using the above link mechanism is further shown in figure 2B. as illustrated in said figure 2B, in the above system, the link (L2) for positioning the micrometer clamp is perpendicular to the plane of paper. The orientation (angular) of micrometer head (L3) is changed with respect to both the fixed and rotatable links. It would be apparent from the representative triangle in the figures that <abc and also are changed when the length bc is></abc>
18 21MAR 2007<br><br>
length of the other two sides remain unaltered. The side BC in the representative triangle correspond to the micrometer spindle while <cab illustrates the angle produced by mechanism.></cab>
Reference is further invited to figure 2C, which illustrate the geometrical relation between fixed and rotatable link in the linkage mechanism using a linear drive. Whenever a feed is given to micrometer head to produce angle, the orientation of this linear drive in different position 1, 2,3, 4 &amp; 5 varies with respect to both the fixed link and also the rotatable link. The distance between point F and the intersection of circle in the said positions 1,2,3,4 &amp; 5 represents length of micrometer spindle link<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 3A to 3K, which illustrate another embodiment of the system for precision angular motion mechanism for alignment and positioning of optical elements of the invention involving hinged type angular stage.<br>
As clearly illustrated in figure 3, the system according to this embodiment basically involves the operative linkage mechanism involving the fixed frame link (LI), the rotary link (L4), the micrometer clamp link (L2) and the micrometer spindle (L3) to achieve the desired angular precision motion. Importantly however in this embodiment involving the hinged type angular stage, the micrometer clamp link (L2) is guided at both ends i.e. the top and bottom end by provision of selective guides to effectively constrain the micrometer clamp link. For this purpose the clamp link is supported with the bearings in bearing blocks that provide the desired constrained guiding of the clamp link.<br>
The fixed frame link (1) in this embodiment is basically comprised of a mounting block, a T" holder which is joined to the mounting block at one end and to a fixture plate at other end, which in turn connected to the bearing blocks to provide for a fixed frame assembling. However fixure plate and "T" holder and bottom bearing block can also be made from a single piece.<br>
The operative components activating the above link mechanism for the constrained angular motion is explained in greater detail hereunder in relation to figures 3A to 3K.<br><br>
19<br><br>
As shown by way of the exploded view of the system of figure 3 in the accompanying figure 3A, in such an embodiment the system basically involves the frame/mounting block (1) which is joined to the bearing guides of the micrometer clamp link (3) through the T" holder (6) and the fixture plate (7). Once assembled the mounting block (1), the WT" holder (6), fixture plate (7) and the bearing blocks (8) provide a fixed frame structure (LI).<br>
The rotary shaft (2) is supported with respect to the mounting block (1) through selective bearing arrangement and carries at the top, the coarse positioning top (9). The link comprising micrometer head (L3) is operatively connected to said rotary shaft link (L4) . the micrometer head (12) is clamped with micrometer clamps (3) with said micrometer head operatively connected to said rotary shaft via micrometer end connector (5), self aligning bearings (13) and the "L" bracket (4). Once assembled the above operative linkage mechanism provides the desired constrained angular motion for alignment and positioning of optical elements involving turning pair, screw pair and self aligning bearing. The component configuration involved in the above system is illustrated by way of the component specification as per figures 3B to 3K.<br>
[n accordance with another aspect of invention, there is provided a translation stage adapted to carry the holder on a movable slide to hold optics for monochromator. Alternatively the stage can also carry a plate having a step in the height to thereby provide for a wide flat platform covering length equal to the mounting block for supporting any other mounts/optics. Reference is invited to accompanying figure 4, which provides for a schematic illustration of the translation stage in accordance with present invention. As shown in said figure and also in the accompanying figure 4A (exploded view) the translation stage is provided to comprise of the mounting block (1) which is provided to securely hold the micrometer clamp (5) with the micrometer head (6) effectively clamped with respect to said micrometer clamp (5). A micrometer end connector (7) is shown operatively connected at one end to the micrometer head and at its other end to the bearing block (4). movable slide (2) is joined with the bearing block and guided by guides (3). This movable slide is adapted to move and carry the holder holding the optics for the monochromator. The exploded view further illustrates the operative connection of the components<br><br>
20<br><br>
constituting the translation stage system of the invention including the provision of preloading screws (8) and the locking screws (9) of the guides. The design of movable slide and the use of micrometer end connector-bearing joint made the size of translation stage very small. The size of this stage is 54mm (length-excluding micrometer) x 35mm (width) x 29.6mm (height- including projected height) and this stage produces a travel of 22mm.<br>
The material of construction can be stainless steel for different links, but use of other ferrous materials and also non-ferrous materials like Aluminum alloys are also suitable. Nylon can be used for very lightweight stages. The weight of the combination stage (including angular and translation stage as per the disclosed size, higher bearing size with a base size 45mmSq.) is about l000gms when the material is steel. But when the components of the angular stage are made using Aluminum the weight of the stage was 600gms. The weight can be further reduced using nylon for construction of angular stage in suitable cases.<br>
The resolution of the angular stage with the given dimensions is ~ 0.01° when the micrometer head used is having a resolution of 10 microns. The resolution is improved to ~ 0.001° when 1 micron resolution micrometer head is used for hinged type stage. Range of the instrument is 0 to 22° when 25mm micrometer head is used with the given dimensions of angular stage. If 50mm micrometer head is used the range become 0 to 47°. Initially some (up to 3mm) motion of micrometer will be reduced due to the fitting of end connector. Range of linear motion stage is 0 to 22mm and resolution of linear motion stage is 10-micron when using a micrometer of 10-micron resolution and 25mm travel<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above-disclosed system of the invention to eliminate spring in angular and linear motion stages using bearing joint and increasing the performance using end connector. In particular for said angular motion stage, the turning pair-screw pair and self-aligning bearing combination act as a joint between the rotating link (L4) and the micrometer head (13). Whenever the feed is given by the micrometer head the motion is transferred to the rotating link (L4) through the self aligning bearing. However, as the direction is reversed some error comes into play, which depends on bearing clearance and also on micrometer accuracy. Similarly, sensitivity- response, resolution of stage is also<br><br>
21<br><br>
affected by bearing clearances. Thus in both the cases dimensions of end connector play an important role to introduce suitable interference with the inner race of bearing and reducing the radial clearance. As regards linear motion stage here also bearings act as a joint between the moving and fixed plates and the radial clearances are affected by the end connection dimensions.<br>
Importantly, comparative tests carried out of the system for precision angular motion of the invention with respect to a goniometer has confirmed the fine resolution, good range and repeatability achieved by the system of the invention. The turning -pair, screw pair and self -aligning bearing combination of the system is found to achieve required resolution of 0.001° and respond to minute linear feed of 1 micron and transfer the motion to the operative rotating link. The repeatability of the system was found to be better than 9 arc seconds. Translation stages made using micrometer end connector and deep groove ball bearing as a joint can also be used for resolution better than 10 microns.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system for precision angular motion to achieve precision and constrained angular motion about single axis of rotation at any orientation using linear drives along with translation drive to preciously position the optical element involving independent linear and angular motions. The system combines selectively fine resolution, good range and repeatability, self-locking, less weight, small size and cost effective.<br><br>
