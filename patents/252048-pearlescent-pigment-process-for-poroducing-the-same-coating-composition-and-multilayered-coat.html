				<td>PEARLESCENT PIGMENT, PROCESS FOR PRODUCTING<br>
THE SAME, COATING COMPOSITION<br>
AND MULTILAYERED COAT<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a pearlescent pigment <br>
obtained by coating surfaces of specific flaky substrate<br>
particles (which may hereinafter be called simply "substrate<br>
particles") with a metal oxide, its production process, and<br>
its use.<br>
Background Art<br>
Known pearlescent pigments include those obtained by<br>
coating surfaces of substrateparticles, suchasmica flakes,<br>
with a metal oxide of large refractive index like titanium<br>
dioxide. In recent years, pearlescent pigments making use<br>
of thin alumina flakes as substrate particles improved in<br>
smoothness, heat resistance and transparency, in which mica<br>
flakes are deficient as substrate particles, have been<br>
proposed (Patent Document 1) . However, when plate alumina<br>
produced by a hydrothermal process is used as substrate<br>
particles in the process described in the above patent<br>
document, adsorbability of particles of a metal oxide on<br>
the alumina is very low, and hence, the particles of the<br><br>
metal oxide are bound into large aggregates , thereby failing<br>
to provide a pigment equipped with satisfactory<br>
photoluminescence. Even if the metal oxide particles are<br>
adsorbed on the plate alumina, the particles of the metal<br>
oxide which cover the substrate particles are so large that<br>
wholly uniform photoluminescence, from which no graininess<br>
is felt, or smooth and elegant photoluminescence, that is,<br>
silky pearlescence is hardly available. It has, therefore,<br>
been unable to fully satisfy artistry required for various<br>
applications.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-09-255891<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
When the metal oxide coating is conducted using<br>
ordinary substrate particles, the pearlescence of the<br>
conventional pearlescent pigments is not uniform and is<br>
deficient in smoothness as a whole due to the inclusion of<br>
large substrate particles having a large average particle<br>
size and wide reflection areas as mentioned above, although<br>
it has discontinuous strong photoluminescence. In an<br>
attempt to overcome this problem, substrate particles of<br>
small average particle size were used. The above-described<br>
grainy feel was reduced, but it was still unable to derive<br>
any pearlescence having a smooth, elegant, photoluminescent<br>
and silky feel.<br><br>
With the foregoing circumstances of the conventional<br>
art in view, an object of the present invention is, therefore,<br>
to provide a pearlescent pigment, which has, as a whole,<br>
both uniform photoluminescence and an elegant and silky feel<br>
and can fully satisfy artistry as required.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a coating composition capable of forming a coat having<br>
characteristic photoluminescence in a single-apply coating<br>
process, a 2-coat 1-bake coating process, a 3-coat 2-bake<br>
coating process or a coating process that forms at least<br>
one pearlescent coat layer between stacked at least one<br>
desired coat layers or on a coat layer.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
The above-described objects can be achieved by the<br>
present invention to be described hereinafter.<br>
Described specifically, the present invention<br>
provides a pearlescent pigment comprising flaky alumina<br>
substrate particles produced by a hydrothermal process and<br>
coat layers formed on the substrate particles and composed<br>
of at least one metal oxide comprising at least a titanium<br>
oxide, wherein the metal oxide has an average particle size<br>
of from 1 to 500 nm.<br>
In the above-described pearlescent pigment according<br>
to the present invention, it can be preferred that the coat<br>
layers of the metal oxide are mixed layers and/or stacked<br><br>
layers of two or more metal oxides comprising at least the<br>
titanium oxide; that the flaky alumina substrate particles<br>
have an average particle size of from 0.1 to 50 µm; that<br>
the alumina substrate particles have an aspect ratio<br>
(particle size/thickness) of from 5 to 500; that the alumina<br>
substrate particles have an average particle size a<br>
statistical variation coefficient of which is from 20 to<br>
90; and that the pearlescent pigment has an average particle<br>
size a statistical variation coefficient of which is from<br>
20 to 90.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
production of a pearlescent pigment, which comprises<br>
dispersing in water flaky alumina substrate particles<br>
produced by a hydrothermal process and activated at surfaces<br>
thereof by at least one method selected fromplasma treatment,<br>
ultrasonic treatment, acid treatment, alkali treatment,<br>
shock treatment or chemical etching treatment, hydrolyzing<br>
in the resulting dispersion a metal salt comprising at least<br>
a salt of titanium, allowing the resulting metal hydroxide<br>
or metal oxide to deposit on surfaces of the alumina substrate<br>
particles, and then subjecting the resulting deposit to heat<br>
treatment to form, on the surfaces of the substrate particles,<br>
metal oxide coat layers having an average particle size of<br>
from 1 to 500 nm.<br>
Further, the present invention also provides a coating<br>
composition comprising the above-described pearlescent<br><br>
pigment of the present invention and a film-forming resin.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition can further contain a<br>
liquid medium.<br>
Still further, the present invention also provides<br>
a multilayered coat comprising a base coat layer formed from<br>
the above-described coating composition of the present<br>
invention and a clear coat layer formed on the base coat<br>
layer.<br>
Preferably, the above-described multilayered coat<br>
can have reflected light intensities having a statistical<br>
variation coefficient of not greater than 5 when measured<br>
by a photometer; or a 45°/0° reflection intensity ratio of<br>
not greater than 100 when measured at an elevation angle<br>
of not smaller than 0° by a goniophotometer.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a<br>
multilayered coat comprising a colored first base coat layer<br>
formed on a surface of a substrate, a second base coat layer<br>
formed from the above-described coating composition of the<br>
present invention on the colored first base coat layer, and<br>
a clear coat layer formed on the second base coat layer;<br>
a multilayered coat comprising a first coat layer formed<br>
on a surface of a substrate and at least one second coat<br>
layer formed from the above-described coating composition<br>
of the present invention on the first coat layer; and also<br>
a multilayered coat comprising at least two first coat layers<br>
formed one over the other on a surface of a substrate and<br><br>
at least one second coat layer formed from a coating<br>
composition according to claim 8 between the at least two<br>
first coat layers.<br>
Advantageous Effects of the Present Invention<br>
The present inventors have proceeded with extensive<br>
research to achieve the above-described objects of the<br>
present invention. As a result, it has been found that color<br>
visions of a pearlescent pigment, which was obtained by<br>
activating surfaces of substrate particles obtained by a<br>
hydrothermal process and then by coating the substrate<br>
particles with at least one metal oxide of a particle size<br>
in a range of from 1 to 500 nm, and colored articles making<br>
use of the pigment have such artistry as giving a<br>
graininess-free, smooth, elegant, photoluminescent and<br>
silky color tone. In addition, it has also been found that,<br>
when the above-described various coats are formed on<br>
substrates by using coating compositions containing the<br>
above-described pearlescent pigment, the coats fully show<br>
good artistry.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention will next be described in further<br>
detail based on certain preferred embodiments.<br>
The term "hydrothermal process" as used herein means<br>
a process that allows crystals of a substrate material such<br><br>
as alumina to grow in a solvent of high temperature and high<br>
pressure. Conditions for the crystal growth are specific<br>
to the chemical structure of the substrate material, the<br>
solvent, temperature and pressure used, and the like. It<br>
is, therefore, possible to synthesize desired substrate<br>
particles in accordance with an average particle size, an<br>
aspect ratio and the like, which are required for the<br>
substrate particles. The chemical and physical properties<br>
of the substrate particles produced by the hydrothermal<br>
process are unique properties not available from any process<br>
other than the hydrothermal process.<br>
Substrate particles which can be obtained by the<br>
hydrothermal process can include alumina, boehmite, iron<br>
oxide, hydroapatite, zirconia, titanates, titanium oxide,<br>
cobalt hydroxide oxide, calcium silicate and the like. Any<br>
substrate particles may be used insofar as they have<br>
uniformity, smoothness, heat resistance, transparency and<br>
the like and provide artistry as required. However,<br>
preferred is alumina which satisfies the above-described<br>
conditions with a good balance. Flaky alumina substrate<br>
particles which are preferred as mentioned above are known<br>
by themselves, and are available for use in the present<br>
invention, for example, from Kinsei Matec Co., Ltd., for<br>
example, under the trade names of "YFA-02050" (average<br>
particle size: 2.0 µm, aspect ratio: 50), "YFA-07070"<br>
(average particle size: 7.0 µm, aspect ratio: 70),<br><br>
"YFA-05070" (average particle size: 5.0 µm, aspect ratio:<br>
70), "YFA-10030" (average particle size: 10.0 µm, aspect<br>
ratio: 27), etc.<br>
The average particle size of the substrate particles<br>
may be from 0.1 to 50 µm, preferably from 0.3 to 30 µm, more<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 20 µm. An average particle size<br>
greater than 50 µm is not preferred in that the resulting<br>
pearlescent pigment strongly reflects light to impair a silky<br>
color tone. On the other hand, an average particle size<br>
smaller than 0.1 µm is not preferred in that the resulting<br>
pearlescent pigment strongly scatters light to impair a silky<br>
color tone. The aspect ratio of the substrate particles<br>
may be from 5 to 500, preferably from 7 to 300, more preferably<br>
from 10 to 200. An aspect ratio smaller than 5 is not<br>
preferred in that the substrate particles is poor in<br>
orientation and interference light (pearlescence) is hardly<br>
available from the resulting pearlescent pigment. On the<br>
other hand, an aspect ratio greater than 500 is not preferred<br>
in that the substrate particles are prone to breakage during<br>
handling such as circulation, mixing and dispersion.<br>
Further, the particle size distribution of the<br>
substrate particles may be from 20 to 90, preferably from<br>
25 to 80, more preferably from 30 to 70 in terms of statistical<br>
variation coefficient (CV value) . This CV value means the<br>
percentage of a standard deviation based on an average<br>
particle size in a particle size distribution, and indicates<br><br>
the degree of scattering of the particle size distribution.<br>
It is to be noted that each particle size distribution was<br>
measured by "MULTISIZER3 COULER COUNTER" (trade name;<br>
manufacture by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and its statistical<br>
variation coefficient was also calculated.<br>
When the CV value of the substrate particles is 20<br>
or greater, small particle-size particles, which produce<br>
scattered light, and particles, which produce rather strong<br>
reflected light, are well-balanced so that the resulting<br>
pearlescent pigment can be provided with a silky color tone.<br>
When the CV value of the substrate particles is smaller than<br>
20, on the other hand, the particle size distribution of<br>
the substrate particles is extremely narrow, but small<br>
particle-size particles, which produce scattered light, and<br>
large particle-size particles, which produce rather strong<br>
reflected light, both decrease, resulting in the lack of<br>
a balance between scattered light and reflected light so<br>
that the resulting pearlescent pigment is deprived of a silky<br>
color tone. On the other hand, a CV value of the substrate<br>
particles, which is greater than 90, is not preferred in<br>
that scattered light and reflected light are poorly balanced<br>
and the resulting pearlescent pigment is also provided with<br>
an impaired silky color tone.<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention can be obtained by activating the surfaces of the<br>
substrate particles and then coating the surfaces with at<br><br>
least one metal oxide. In the pearlescent pigment according<br>
to the present invention, the metal oxide is required to<br>
have a particle size of from 1 to 500 nm, preferably from<br>
3 to 300 nm, more preferably from 5 to 200 nm. When the<br>
particles size of the metal oxide with which the substrate<br>
particles are coated fall within the range of from 1 to 500<br>
nm, the metal oxide has high crystallinity so that the<br>
refractive index inherent to the metal oxide is fully<br>
exhibited. Moreover, the top surfaces of the coats of the<br>
pearlescent pigment are smooth and produce sufficient<br>
reflected light. As a result, a satisfactory interference<br>
color is produced, so that graininess-free, smooth and<br>
elegant photoluminescence, that is, a silky feel is higher,<br>
thereby making it possible to fully satisfy artistry as<br>
desired.<br>
It is to be noted that the above-described particle<br>
size indicates the particle size of metal oxide particles<br>
or aggregates of metal oxide particles after hydrolysis or<br>
sintering. The average particle size of each metal oxide<br>
was calculated from 50 particles chosen at random from a<br>
micrograph obtained by a scanning electron microscope,<br>
"FE-SEMS-4800" (tradename; manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.) .<br>
When the particle size of the metal oxide exceed 500<br>
nm, the metal oxide layers have substantial surface roughness<br>
so that reflected light from the pearlescent pigment is<br>
considerably weakened and no sufficient interference color<br><br>
is produced. When the particle size of the metal oxide is<br>
smaller than 1 nm, on the other hand, the metal oxide is<br>
provided with substantially reduced crystallinity so that<br>
the refractive index inherent to the metal oxide is not<br>
available. As a result, the pearlescent pigment does not<br>
produce any sufficient interference color. Even if the<br>
coats of the metal oxide are specified in thickness, a<br>
sufficient interference color cannot be obtained unless the<br>
metal oxide forming the coat layers is controlled in particle<br>
size.<br>
By the coats of the metal oxide, the resulting<br>
pearlescent pigment is provided with a silver tone color<br>
or, when the coats is increased in thickness, with an<br>
interference color. Further, the surf aces of the substrate<br>
particles may be coated with a colored metal oxide, for<br>
example, with an iron oxide to obtain a reddish or blackish,<br>
pearlescent pigment. Furthermore, the pearlescent pigment<br>
may be provided with still higher saturation by adsorbing<br>
fine particles of a coloring pigment, which will be described<br>
subsequently herein, on the surfaces of the pearlescent<br>
pigment.<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention can also be obtained by coating the surfaces of<br>
the above-described substrate particles with a mixture of<br>
two or more metal oxides or by stacking and coating two or<br>
more metal oxide layers stepwise on the surfaces of the<br><br>
above-described substrate particles. By coating with such<br>
a mixture or by conducting such stacking and coating,<br>
physical properties not available from a single metal oxide<br>
alone can be obtained, for example, light resistance, water<br>
resistance and the like can be improved. Especially by<br>
successively stacking two or more metal oxides into an<br>
increased number of layers, a pearlescent pigment of still<br>
higher photoluminescence can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, the pearlescent pigment according to the<br>
present invention may preferably have a particle size<br>
distribution the statistical variation coefficient (CV<br>
value) ranges from 20 to 90. Its reasons are similar to<br>
those mentioned above in connection with the substrate<br>
particles.<br>
A description will next be made of the process of the<br>
present invention for the production of the pearlescent<br>
pigment. The pearlescent pigment can be obtained by coating<br>
the surfaces of the substrate particles with the metal oxide<br>
having the particle size of from 1 to 500 nm.<br>
For a general pearlescent pigment, it is necessary<br>
to control the particle size of a metal oxide to be deposited<br>
on substrate particles after hydrolysis or sintering and<br>
the aggregation property of the particles such that the<br>
particles of the metal oxide are arrayed on the surfaces<br>
of the substrate surfaces. The process described in Patent<br>
Document 1 referred to in the above, however, is practically<br><br>
impossible to control the partible size, aggregation and<br>
arraying of the metal oxide, and therefore, cannot obtain<br>
a pearlescent pigment capable of producing sufficient<br>
interference light, because substrate particles produced<br>
by a hydrothermal process are extremely high in surface<br>
smoothness and have low adsorbing ability for the metal oxide<br>
on their surfaces, and the aggregation of the metal oxide<br>
itself tends to proceed easily. As a result, the metal oxide<br>
exists as large aggregates and has low adsorbability on the<br>
surfaces of the substrate particles. Even when adsorbed,<br>
the resulting coats of the metal oxide are not uniform in<br>
thickness and the top surfaces of the coats become rough.<br>
Accordingly, reflected light is considerably weakened so<br>
that no sufficient interference color is produced.<br>
Even if the substrate particles produced by the<br>
hydrothermal process are coated with the metal oxide by a<br>
known technique and moreover, the resulting coats are<br>
specified in thickness, it is still impossible to control<br>
the particle size and aggregation property of the metal oxide<br>
forming the coat layers and to obtain a pearlescent pigment<br>
having a sufficient interference color unless the adsorbing<br>
ability of the surfaces of the substrate particles is<br>
improved.<br>
In the present invention, it was found that by<br>
activating beforehand the surfaces of the substrate<br>
particles produced by the hydrothermal process, the<br><br>
particles of the metal oxide can be eVenly adsorbed as fine<br>
particles on the surfaces of the substrate particles. For<br>
the above-described surface activation, usable examples<br>
include plasma treatments such as thermal plasma treatment<br>
and low-temperature plasma treatment, ultrasonic treatment,<br>
acid treatment, alkali treatment, tumbling-medium-assisted<br>
dispersion treatment, shock treatments such as<br>
high-pressure shock treatment and sand blasting treatment,<br>
ozone treatment, and chemical etching treatments such as<br>
electrochemical treatment. These treatments can be applied<br>
either singly or in combination.<br>
Treatment gas usable in plasma treatment can be one<br>
of or a combination of two or more of nitrogen, ammonia,<br>
a mixed nitrogen-hydrogen gas, oxygen-containing gases such<br>
as oxygen, ozone, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, rare gases<br>
such as helium, argon, neon and xenon, halogen gases such<br>
as fluorine, chlorine and iodine, and mixed gases obtained<br>
by mixing fluorocarbon gases, such as tetrafluorocarbon,<br>
hexafluorocarbon and hexafluoropropylene, in<br>
oxygen-containing gases at volume ratios not greater than<br>
1/2.<br>
Examples of a method for generating the<br>
above-described plasma include the method that a direct<br>
current is applied to a gas to effect plasma decomposition,<br>
the method that a radiofrequency voltage is applied to a<br><br>
gas to effect plasma decomposition, the method that a gas<br>
is subjected to plasma decomposition by electron cyclotron<br>
resonance, and the method that a gas is thermally decomposed<br>
by a hot filament.<br>
As the pressure of the treatment gas upon the<br>
above-described plasma treatment, 1 x 10"4 to 100 Torr is<br>
preferred because a low pressure requires a costly vacuum<br>
chamber and vacuum pumping system. The actual treatment<br>
gas pressure is appropriately determined depending on the<br>
excitation means within the above-described pressure range.<br>
However, 1 x 10-2 to 100 Torr is more preferred because it<br>
is possible to apply a direct current or radiofrequency<br>
current capable of generating a plasma even when the system<br>
is simple and the treatment gas pressure is relatively high.<br>
The inputted electric power required for the<br>
above-described plasma treatment differs depending on the<br>
area and shape of electrodes. Lower electric power results<br>
in a low plasma density so that more time is required for<br>
the treatment. On the other hand, higher electric power<br>
induces uneven treatment. The electric power may,<br>
therefore, be from 20 to 200 W preferably.<br>
When the construction of the electrodes employed in<br>
the above-described plasma treatment is the parallel plate<br>
type, the coaxial cylinder type, the curved counter plate<br>
type or the hyperbolic counter plate type, a voltage is<br>
applied by the capacity coupling method. When a<br><br>
radiofrequency voltage is applied, it can be applied in an<br>
induction manner by using external electrodes. The<br>
distance between the electrodes is appropriately determined<br>
depending on the treatment pressure and the substrate<br>
particles, and can be set desirably at a possible shortest<br>
distance for plasma treatment because a longer distance leads<br>
to a lower plasma density and requires higher electric power.<br>
The time of the plasma treatment is determined<br>
depending on the inputted electric power. In general,<br>
however, 1 to 60 minutes are preferred because a shorter<br>
plasma treatment time cannot achieve a sufficient degree<br>
of activation of the substrate particles while no significant<br>
improvement can be expected in the degree of activation of<br>
the substrate particles even when the plasma treatment time<br>
is made excessively long. Concerning the temperature<br>
during the plasma treatment, neither heating nor cooling<br>
is absolutely needed.<br>
The above-described plasma treatment is required to<br>
be evenly applied over the entire surfaces of the flaky<br>
substrate particles. It is, therefore, preferred to<br>
conduct the plasma treatment while rolling the flaky<br>
substrate particles. Such mixing methods can include the<br>
method that the flaky substrate particles are sealed in a<br>
vessel and are tumbled together with the vessel and the method<br>
that the flaky substrate particles are mixed by vibrations.<br>
An appropriate mixing method can be determined depending<br><br>
on the particle size and amount of the flaky substrate<br>
particles to be treated.<br>
Any ultrasonic oscillator can be used in the ultrasonic<br>
treatment insofar as its oscillating frequency is in a range<br>
of from 50 Hz to 100 KHz and its output power is in a range<br>
of from 20 to 1, 000 W. An oscillating frequency lower than<br>
50 Hz leads to a substantial reduction in the surface<br>
uniformity of the energy distribution of ultrasonic waves<br>
striking the flaky substrate particles, and hence to<br>
insufficient activation. An oscillating frequency higher<br>
than 100 KHz, on the other hand, leads to a substantial<br>
reduction in the overall energy density, and also to<br>
insufficient activation of the substrate particles. Even<br>
within the above-described range, cavitations may still<br>
occur depending on the structure and material of a tank to<br>
be used and on the kind of a dispersing medium to be used.<br>
In such a case, it is desired to increase the oscillation<br>
frequency or to lower the output power such that the treatment<br>
system can be kept under conditions which do not cause<br>
cavitations.<br>
In the present invention, ultrasonic vibrations can<br>
be applied either continuously or intermittently. It is,<br>
however, preferred to apply ultrasonic vibrations by<br>
controlling them to appropriate conditions within the<br>
above-described frequency range of from 50 Hz to 100 KHz<br>
and the above-described power output range of from 20 to<br><br>
1,000 W.<br>
An acid usable in the acid treatment can be one of<br>
or a combination of two or more of inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric<br>
acid and carbonic acid, organic acids such as acetic acid,<br>
citric acid and benzoic acid, and resin acids such as acrylic<br>
resins and rosin. An alkali usable in the alkali treatment<br>
can be one of or a combination of two or more of alkali metal<br>
salts such as caustic soda and caustic potash, alkaline earth<br>
metal salts such as calcium hydroxide, and weak bases such<br>
as ammonia, sodium carbonate, aniline and phenol.<br>
The concentration and temperature of an acid or alkali<br>
solution in the acid treatment or alkali treatment may be<br>
in a range of from 0.1 to 99 wt% and a range of from 5 to<br>
95°C, respectively, although an efficient treatment<br>
temperature may be more preferably from 15 to 70°C. The<br>
treatment time is suitably determined depending on the<br>
concentration and temperature, with a range of from 5 minutes<br>
to 6 hours being preferred. The acid or alkali treatment<br>
may be repeated twice or more, or the acid and alkali<br>
treatments may be alternately conducted at least once. The<br>
acid treatment or alkali treatment also effects a pH<br>
adjustment, so that a pH buffer may be used. Further, a<br>
surfactant, organic solvent and/or the like may also be used<br>
as aid(s) in combination.<br>
The shock treatment is a method for physically<br><br>
activating the substrate particles. Specific methods<br>
include partial grinding of the surfaces of the substrate<br>
particles by shaking or collision, and also, polishing by<br>
tumbling. Treatment methods which can achieve such partial<br>
grinding or polishing include dispersing shock treatment<br>
by a homogenizer, dissolver, sand mill, high-speed mixer<br>
or paint conditioner, high-pressure shock treatment by a<br>
high-pressure homogenizer, sand blasting treatment, jet<br>
mill treatment, and the like.<br>
The concentration of the substrate particles in the<br>
liquid medium in the shock treatment may be from 1 to 200<br>
wt%, with from 5 to 150 wt% being preferred. A concentration<br>
lower than 1 wt% results in a poor shock efficiency, while<br>
a concentration higher than 200 wt% results in thickening<br>
so that the shock treatment is rendered difficult. For the<br>
shock treatment that needs a medium upon effecting the same,<br>
glass beads, steel balls, zirconia beads and the like can<br>
be used, and the weight ratio of the medium to the substrate<br>
particles may be from 0 to 1,000 wt%, preferably from 0 to<br>
500 wt%. It is not particularly needed to use a medium when<br>
the activation of the surfaces of the substrate particles<br>
can be sufficiently achieved by the collision of the<br>
substrate particles themselves.<br>
In the shock treatment, a pH buffer may be used.<br>
Further, a surfactant, organic solvent and/or the like may<br>
also be used as aid(s) in combination. The time of the<br><br>
shock treatment is determined depending on the concentration<br>
of the substrate particles and the type and amount of the<br>
medium. However, the substrate particles cannot be<br>
provided with a sufficient degree of activation when the<br>
time of the shock treatment becomes short, and no substantial<br>
improvement can be expected in the activation degree of the<br>
substrate particles even when the time of the shock treatment<br>
is made excessively long. Therefore, 1 to 60 minutes are<br>
preferred in general. It is to be noted that the<br>
above-described physical activation treatment requires the<br>
payment of an attention to substantial changes in particle<br>
size distribution and CV value because, when the intensity<br>
of shock on the substrate particles is increased, the<br>
treatment is not limited to the surface activation of the<br>
substrate particles and may also break the substrate<br>
particles.<br>
In addition, other conventional treatments,<br>
including chemical etching treatments such as ozone<br>
treatment, UV treatment and electrochemical treatment, can<br>
also be used widely.<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention can also be obtained by adsorbing a hydrated oxide<br>
of a metal such as titanium, zirconium, tin or iron with<br>
a particle size of from 1 to 500 nm on the surface-treated<br>
substrate particles by a known method, for example, by a<br>
method that thermally hydrolyzes a salt of the metal in water<br><br>
in which the substrate particles have been dispersed or by<br>
a method that subjects the salt of the metal to neutralization<br>
hydrolysis with an alkali in the water; and then by calcining<br>
the hydrated oxide. By conducting this calcination step<br>
in a reducing atmosphere, the metal oxide is converted into<br>
a low-valence titanium oxide or a low-valence iron oxide,<br>
so that a pearlescent pigment tinged in a black color can<br>
be obtained. Additional artistry can be also imparted by<br>
a known method in addition to the use of the metal oxide.<br>
The atomic weight of the metal in the water-soluble<br>
metal salt required to obtain pearlescence (interference<br>
color) may be from 2.0 x 10-5 mol to 2.0 x 10-1 mol, more<br>
preferably from 4.0 x 10-5 mol to 1.0 x 10-1 mol. If the<br>
atomic weight of the metal is lower than 2.0 x 10-5 mol,<br>
the flaky substrate particles cannot be coated so that no<br>
interference light is produced. If the atomic weight of<br>
the metal exceeds 1.0 x 10-1 mol, inconveniences arise in<br>
that, even if the flaky substrate particles can be coated,<br>
cracks tend to occur in the coat layers after calcinations,<br>
and as a result, the intensity of interference light is<br>
lowered.<br>
A description will next be made about the coating<br>
composition according to the present invention. The<br>
coating composition according to the present invention<br>
contains the above-described pearlescent pigment of the<br>
present invention and a film-forming resin, and preferably,<br><br>
may contain the pearlescent pigment and film-forming resin<br>
in a liquid medium. Usable examples of the film-forming<br>
resin include, but are not limited to, film-forming resins<br>
employed in the field of conventionally-known coating<br>
compositions, such as acrylic resins, acrylic melamine<br>
resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer resins,<br>
alkyd resins, polyester resins, polyurethane resins and<br>
amino resins.<br>
As a solvent for dissolving or dispersing the<br>
pearlescent pigment and film-forming resin, one<br>
conventionally and commonly known to be useful in coating<br>
compositions can be used. Specific examples include water,<br>
toluene, xylene, butyl acetate, methyl acetate, acetone,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methanol,<br>
ethanol, butanol, cyclohexane, and the like. These<br>
solvents may also be used as mixed solvents.<br>
In the coating composition according to the present<br>
invention, the pearlescent pigment of the present invention<br>
may be used in a proportion of from 0.005 to 50 parts by<br>
weight, preferably from 0.1 to 30 parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of the film-forming resin. Use of the<br>
pearlescent pigment in a proportion of smaller than 0.005<br>
parts by weight cannot obtain a coating composition the<br>
provision of which is one of the objects of the present<br>
invention. On the other hand, use of the pearlescent pigment<br>
in a proportion of greater than 50 parts by weight can obtain<br><br>
a coating composition the provision of which is one of the<br>
objects of the present invention, but is not preferred<br>
because the resulting coats are provided with reduced<br>
physical properties.<br>
In the present invention, the above-described<br>
pearlescent pigment can be used singly or in combination<br>
with one or more other pigments. As coloring pigments usable<br>
in combination, pigments employed in ordinary coating<br>
compositions and the like can be used. Specific examples<br>
include phthalocyanine pigments, quinacridone pigments,<br>
perylene pigments, anthraquinone pigments, DPP pigments,<br>
metal complex pigments, transparent iron oxide pigments,<br>
carbon black, titanium oxide, and zinc oxide. Further, as<br>
metal powder pigments, aluminum powder, copper powder,<br>
stainless steel powder, and the like can be mentioned. Among<br>
these, aluminum powder is used most commonly. As special<br>
metal pigments, metal colloids and the like can be used.<br>
As mica pigments usable in combination in the present<br>
invention, conventionally-known mica pigments can be widely<br>
used in combination, and illustrative are transparent pearl<br>
mica and colored mica. As light interference pigments,<br>
interference mica, interference alumina, interference mica<br>
(interference glass) and the like can be mentioned. In<br>
addition, one or more of fillers, antistatic agents,<br>
stabilizers, antioxidants, UV absorbers and the like can<br>
also be added as needed in the coating composition according<br><br>
to the present invention.<br>
When the coating composition according to the present<br>
invention contains the pearlescent pigment of the present<br>
invention and another pigment, a base coating composition<br>
containing the pearlescent pigment of the present invention<br>
and another base coating composition containing the another<br>
pigment can be prepared beforehand and these two types of<br>
base coating compositions can then be blended together into<br>
the coating composition as desired, or as an alternative,<br>
the pearlescent pigment and the another pigment can be mixed<br>
together at the beginning and can then be formulated into<br>
the coating composition.<br>
The coating composition obtained as described above<br>
is applied onto a substrate such as a metal plate, glass<br>
plate, ceramic plate or plastic plate, to which surface<br>
preparation may have been applied as needed, by spray coating,<br>
electrostatic coating, flow coating, roll coating or the<br>
like, dried and then crosslinked and cured to form a colored<br>
coat layer.<br>
The coat formed by applying the coating composition<br>
of the present invention onto a substrate has a color tone<br>
of a graininess-free, smooth, elegant and silky feel,<br>
compared with conventional TiO2-based pearlescent pigments<br>
for coatings. Owing to the possession of the<br>
above-described properties, coats having excellent<br>
characteristic photoluminescence, which are not seen on<br><br>
coats available from conventional coating<br>
compositions, can be formed in a single-apply coating<br>
process, a 2-coat 1-bake coating process, a 3-coat 2-<br>
bake coating process or a coating process that forms,<br>
with a coating composition containing the pearlescent<br>
pigment of the present invention, at least one coat<br>
layer between stacked two desired coat layers of at<br>
least one kind or on a desired coat layer.<br>
 A coat can also be formed by using the above-<br>
described colored coat layer as a base coat layer;<br>
applying a clear coating composition, which has been<br>
prepared by dissolving or dispersing a resin having<br>
low compatibility with the above-described film<br>
forming resin in an organic solvent, on the base coat<br>
layer; drying the clear coating composition; an then<br>
subjecting it to heat treatment. The coat formed by<br>
applying the coating composition of the present<br>
invention onto the substrate has graininess-free<br>
smooth, elegant, silky photoluminescence. Namely, the<br>
pearlescent pigment according to the present invention<br>
is formed of uniform particles, and therefore, is free<br>
of a localized strong photoluminescent feel associated<br>
with large particles and has continuous uniform<br>
photoluminescence. Moreover, reflected light and<br>
scattered light are well-balanced, thereby presenting<br>
a smooth, elegant and silky feel.<br>
 A localized strong photoluminescent feel occurs<br>
as a result of discontinuous specular reflection of<br>
light, which has entered into the coat, by the<br>
pearlescent pigment. A<br><br>
difference between a localized strong photoluminescent feel<br>
and a uniform photoluminescent feel can be quantitated by<br>
measuring specular light intensities of a continuous surface<br>
of a coat, statistically calculating the degrees of<br>
scattering, that is, the dissemination of the specular light<br>
intensities, and comparing their variances with each other.<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on a photometer insofar<br>
as it can measure the specular light intensities of the<br>
continuous surface of the coat, but preferred is a photometer<br>
which can measure specular light intensities while moving<br>
a surface of a specimen in the direction of an X-axis on<br>
the system. As a specific example, a three-dimensional<br>
goniophotometer, "GP-200" (trade name; manufactured by<br>
Murakami Color Research Laboratory Co., Ltd.) , or the like<br>
can satisfy the above-mentioned measurement conditions.<br>
 A coat obtained from the coating composition according<br>
to the present invention is provided with uniform,<br>
graininess-free, smooth photoluminescence in visual<br>
perception when its quantitated variance is 5 or smaller.<br>
When its quantitated variance is greater than 5, on the other<br>
hand, the coat is provided with glaring, grainy<br>
photoluminescence in visual perception and cannot be<br>
provided with uniform, graininess-free, smooth<br>
photoluminescence in visual perception.<br>
Light, which has entered into a coat, is separated<br>
into specular light and scattered light, and is reflected<br><br>
out of the coat. By balancing the specular light and the<br>
scattered light with each other, a smooth, elegant, silky<br>
color tone is obtained as visual perception. Light other<br>
than specular light scatters in all directions, and exists<br>
as three-dimensional scattered light. By<br>
three-dimensionally capturing the specular light and the<br>
three-dimensional scattered light, a perception close to<br>
a state that they are viewed by the human can be reproduced.<br>
The above-mentioned specular light can be measured by a<br>
photometer shown in the system. No particular limitation<br>
is imposed on the photometer insofar as it can measure the<br>
reflection intensity at a desired elevation angle while<br>
changing the receiving angle. Preferred is, however, a<br>
three-dimensional goniophotometer which can continuously<br>
measure reflected light. As a specific example, a<br>
three-dimensional goniophotometer, "GP-200", or the like<br>
can satisfy the above-mentioned measurement conditions.<br>
A silky feel of a coat can be quantitated by measuring<br>
the intensities of reflected light and scattered light at<br>
a desired elevation angle with a three-dimensional<br>
goniophotometer; measuring the reflection intensity at 45°<br>
receiving angle, which is in the neighborhood of specular<br>
light, and the reflection intensity at 0° receiving angle,<br>
which corresponds to representative scattered angle; and<br>
then determining the intensity ratio (45°/0°) of the<br>
intensity at 45° to that at 0°. A coat obtained from the<br><br>
coating composition according to the present invention is<br>
provided with a smooth, elegant, silky photoluminescent feel<br>
in visual perception when the (45°/0°) reflection intensity<br>
ratio of the intensity at 45° receiving angle to that at<br>
0° receiving angle is 100 or smaller. When the (45°/0°)<br>
reflection intensity ratio of the intensity at 45° receiving<br>
angle to that at 0° receiving angle is greater than 100,<br>
on the other hand, no silky photoluminescent feel can be<br>
obtained in visual perception.<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention has a small particle size and a large aspect ratio<br>
so that, even when its content is high in a coat, it is oriented<br>
and the surface smoothness is not lost. Because the<br>
pearlescent pigment according to the present invention is<br>
a pearlescent pigment making use of chemically-unif ormplate<br>
particles produced by a hydrothermal process, it is also<br>
unique in optical characteristics, is excellent in the<br>
balance between reflected light and scattered light,<br>
presents photoluminescence of a graininess-free, smooth,<br>
elegant and silky feel, and can provide a coat of excellent<br>
finish. In a coated color making use of a general pearlescent<br>
pigment, on the other hand, the adoption of a small average<br>
particle size results in non-uniform plate particles having<br>
a small aspect ratio and the fine pigment is not oriented<br>
in the resulting coat, leading to a drawback that the coat<br>
is provided with significantly-reduced photoluminescence<br><br>
or the smoothness of a clear finish is impaired. As an<br>
optical characteristic, reflected light and scattered light<br>
are poorly balanced so that an elegant and silky feel cannot<br>
be obtained.<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention is extremely good, as it is, as a pigment for<br>
ceramics, plastics, inks, toners, inkjet inks and cosmetics.<br>
Further, depending on these applications, treatments are<br>
applied the pearlescent pigment to impart water resistance,<br>
weatherability, chemical resistance, color fastness and<br>
high dispersibility as needed, and the thus-treated<br>
pearlescent pigment is used for the respective applications.<br>

plasma treatment system ("PT-500", trade name; manufactured<br>
by Samco International, Inc.) to conduct plasma treatment<br>
at room temperature for 5 minutes (inputted electric power:<br>

Example 7 &amp; Example 8<br>
"YFA-10030" (average particle size: 10.0 µm, aspect<br>

applied under a water vapor atmosphere at 0.11 Torr by the<br>
powder plasma treatment system ("PT-500") to conduct plasma<br>
treatment at room temperature for 5 minutes (inputted<br>

capacity of 1 L, sodium sulfate (anhydride, 20 g) was added<br>
to desalted water (300 mL) and was dissolved with stirring.<br><br>
To the resultant solution, the plate alumina (20 g) which<br>
had been subjected to plasma treatment as described above<br>
was added, followed by dispersion with stirring.<br>
On the side, a solution (50 g) of titanium chloride,<br>
the titanium concentration of which was 16.5%, was dissolved<br>
in desalted water (300 mL) to provide a solution A. After<br>
the plate alumina dispersion was adjusted to pH 2.0 with<br>
hydrochloric acid and was heated to 80°C, the solution A<br>
was charged at a constant rate over 4 hours by a metering<br>
pump until the substrate particles were provided with an<br>
interference silver color. During the charging, a 10%<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide was added to maintain the pH<br>
of the dispersion at 2.0 and the temperature of the dispersion<br>
was also maintained at 80°C.<br>
After the solution A was charged until the substrate<br>
particles were provided with the interference silver color,<br>
the dispersion was heated for 1 hour under reflux.<br>
Subsequently, insoluble solid matter was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water, dried, and then subjected<br>
to heat treatment at 700°C for 1 hour. Water was added to<br>
the thus-obtained treated matter, and with stirring, the<br>
free salts were caused to dissolve. Insoluble solid matter<br>
was then collected by filtration, washed with water and dried<br>
to obtain TiO2-coated plate alumina (Example 7) . Further,<br>
TiO2-coated plate alumina (Example 8) was obtained by<br>
conducting similar processing as in Example 7 except that<br><br>
the hydrothermally-produced alumina was changed to<br>
"YFA-07070".<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Sodium sulfate (anhydride, 20 g) was added to desalted<br>
water (300 mL) and was dissolved with stirring. To the<br>
resultant solution, plate alumina A (average particle size:<br>
55 µm, aspect ratio: 30, CV value: 95) (20 g) which was not<br>
a hydrothermal product was added, followed by dispersion<br>
with stirring. A solution (30 g) of titanium chloride, the<br>
titanium concentration of which was 16.5%, was charged into<br>
the dispersion. The thus-obtained mixture was stirred,<br>
heated and then refluxed for 4 hours. Subsequently,<br>
insoluble solid matter was collected by filtration, washed<br>
with water, dried, and then subjected to heat treatment at<br>
700°C for 1 hour. Water was added to the thus-obtained<br>
treated matter, and with stirring, the free salts were caused<br>
to dissolve. Insoluble solid matter was then collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water and dried to obtain TiO2-coated<br>
plate alumina (Comparative Example 1).<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
Sodium sulfate (anhydride, 20 g) was added to desalted<br>
water (300 mL) and was dissolved with stirring. To the<br>
resultant solution, plate alumina B (average particle size:<br>
10 µm, aspect ratio: 4.0, CV value: 60) (20 g) which was not<br>
a hydrothermal product was added, followed by dispersion<br>
with stirring. A solution (30 g) of titanium chloride, the<br><br>
titanium concentration of which was 16.5%, was charged into<br>
the dispersion. The thus-obtained mixture was stirred,<br>
heated and then refluxed for 4 hours. Subsequently,<br>
insoluble solid matter was collected by filtration, washed<br>
with water, dried, and then subjected to heat treatment at<br>
700°C for 1 hour. Water was added to the thus-obtained<br>
treated matter, and with stirring, the free salts were caused<br>
to dissolve. Insoluble solid matter was then collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water and dried to obtain TiO2-coated<br>
plate alumina (Comparative Example 2).<br>

Comparative Example 7<br>
A commercial product composed of mica coated with<br>
titanium oxide, "IRIODIN 225 WII" (trade name, product of<br>
Merck Ltd., Japan) , was provided as Comparative Example 7.<br>
The average particle sizes (µm), aspect ratios and<br>
CV values of the substrate particles used in Examples 1-8<br>
and Comparative Examples 1-6 and the particle sizes (nm)<br>
and CV values of the metal oxides of the pearlescent pigments<br>
obtained in Examples 1-8 and Comparative Examples 1-7 were<br>
determined and presented together in Table 1. Each average<br>
particle size and its corresponding aspect ratio were<br>
calculated from 50 particles chosen at random from a<br>
micrograph obtained by a scanning electron microscope<br>
"ERA-8000" (manufactured by Elionix Inc.). Each CV value<br>
is a value calculated as a statistical variation coefficient<br>
based on a measurement performed by using "MULTISIZER3<br>
COULTER COUNTER". The average particle size of each metal<br>
oxide was calculated from 50 particles chosen at random from<br>
a micrograph obtained by "FE-SEM S-4800".<br><br><br><br>
Production Example of Automotive Paints<br>
This example illustrates production and evaluation<br>
examples upon using the pearlescent pigments of the present<br>
invention as coating compositions. Evaluated formulation<br>
examples are presented together in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Mixtures of the formulations A-H were separately<br>
subjected to simple dispersion processing in a sand mill.<br>
Further, the resulting dispersion (50 parts, each) of the<br>
formulations A-H and a mixture (50 parts) of the formulation<br>
P were combined into intimate mixtures, respectively, to<br>
obtain coating compositions A-H (Table 3) . Those coating<br>
compositions each contained 8.55 parts of the pearlescent<br>
pigment per 100 parts of the coating composition, and will<br>
be referred to as "example paint A-H".<br>
Mixtures of the formulations I-O were separately<br>
subjected to simple dispersion processing in a sand mill.<br>
Further, the resulting dispersion (50 parts, each) of the<br>
formulations I-O and a mixture (50 parts) of the formulation<br>
P were combined into intimate mixtures, respectively, to<br>
obtain coating compositions I-O (Table 3). Those coating<br>
compositions each contained 8.55 parts of the pearlescent<br>
pigment per 100 parts of the coating composition, and will<br>
be referred to as "comparative example paint I-O".<br>
The example paints A-H, which contained the<br>
pearlescent pigments obtained above in Examples 1-8,<br>
respectively, and the comparative example paints I-O, which<br>
contained the pearlescent pigments obtained above in<br>
Comparative Examples 1-7, respectively, were applied on<br>
black coat paper sheets by a bar coater (No. 6), respectively.<br>
After dried at room temperature for 30 minutes, the paints<br>
were baked and cured at 120°C for 30 minutes to prepare coated<br><br>
specimens.<br>
 With respect to each of those coated specimens, the<br>
uniformity of photoluminescence was evaluated visually and<br>
was also measured by a three-dimensional goniophotometer<br>
("GP-200") under the following conditions: reflectance<br>
measurement, light source: A light, incident angle: 45°,<br>
receiving angle: 45°, receiver slit: 0.4 mm square, moving<br>
measurement over 40 mm along X-axis on specimen surface,<br>
data sampling intervals: 0.1 mm; and the statistic variance<br>
of the reflection intensity was calculated. The measuring<br>
instrument is depicted in FIG. 1, one example of graphs<br>
obtained by the measurements is shown in FIG. 2, and the<br>
measurement results are presented in Table 3.<br>
] Further, graininess-free, smooth conditions of each<br>
coated specimen were evaluated visually and were also<br>
measured by the three-dimensional goniophotometer<br>
("GP-200") under the following conditions: reflectance<br>
measurement, light source: A light, incident angle: 45°,<br>
receiving angles: 45° and 0°, elevation angle: 2.5°; and the<br>
reflection intensity ratio (45°/0°) was calculated. One<br>
example of graphs obtained by the measurements is shown in<br>
FIG. 3, and the measurement results are presented in Table<br>
3.<br><br><br><br>
Compared with the comparative example paints, the<br>
example paints were lower in variance that indicates the<br>
degree of scattering of photoluminescence and had uniform<br>
photoluminescence as a whole. In addition, the example<br>
paints were lower in reflection intensity ratio at receiving<br>
angles 45° and 0° than the comparative example paints, and<br>
also had a smooth and silky feel well-balanced in specular<br>
light and scattered light.<br>
Moreover, cosmetics, plastics, ceramics, inks,<br>
toners and inkjet ink compositions which contain pearlescent<br>
pigments of the present invention also have, as a whole,<br>
both uniform photoluminescence and graininess-free, smooth<br>
and elegant photoluminescence, that is, a silky feel, and<br>
can fully satisfy artistry as required.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The pearlescent pigment according to the present<br>
invention has, as a whole, uniform photoluminescence and<br>
a color tone having a graininess-free, smooth and elegant<br>
photoluminescence, that is, a silky feel, and therefore,<br>
is optimal for fields where such a color tone is required,<br>
for example, for fields such as ceramics, resins, paints,<br>
construction materials, inks, toners, inkjet ink<br>
compositions and cosmetics and also for fields where<br>
artistry is required.<br><br>
