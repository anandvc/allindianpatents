It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or fertilizers and growth regulators, safeners and semiochemicals.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can<br>
15	furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use<br>
forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
20	When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can<br>
furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce the degradation of the active compound after use in the vicinity of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissue.<br>
25<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>

Le A 35 633-Foreign countries<br><br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as by a good stability to alkali on limed substrates. 5<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic<br>
10	plants  and plant cultivars  obtained by  genetic  engineering,  if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
15	Particularly preferably,  plants  of the  plant cultivars  which  are  in  each  case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with novel properties ("traits") which are grown by conventional cultivation, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These may be cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
20<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
25	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
30	stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the<br>
effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br><br>
Le A 35 633-Foreign countries<br><br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,<br>
in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
5	advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br>
are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
10	processability of the  harvested products.  Further and particularly emphasized<br>
examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
15	important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and<br>
20	snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the<br>
genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of plants to fungi,<br>
25	bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins,<br>
elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The<br>
30	genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination<br>
with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be<br>

mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato<br>
varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize,<br>
cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example<br>
maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of<br>
5	herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton<br>
varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones)  and  STS®  (tolerance to  sulphonylureas,  for example  maize).<br>
10	Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in  a conventional manner for herbicide<br>
tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>

dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders<br>
in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents,<br>
20	odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known<br>
per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to<br>
comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
25	resin and/or one drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than<br>
45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a<br>
30	plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the<br>

Le A 35 633-Foreign countries<br>
active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
5	dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl<br>
phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
10<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br>
15	consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy<br>
consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium s., in<br>
particular fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic<br>
20	term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>

action in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the<br>
10	plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, plant-fortifying (resistance-inducing) substances are to be<br>
understood as meaning those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence<br>
system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with<br>

against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period for which protection is provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
25	The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the<br>

and preparations which comprise insecticidally active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers<br>
5	and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for<br>
10	example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata), and<br>
Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
15<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting,<br>
20	dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active<br>
compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the plants.<br>
25	When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and l0 000g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally<br>
30	between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per<br>
