				<td>CONTRAST AGENT<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to diagnostic contrast agents suitable for use in diagnostic<br>
imaging techniques in which a disease state may be imaged using such contrast agents.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to contrast agents in which the targeting vector binds to<br>
angiotensin II receptors.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Angiotensin II (Ang II) - the octapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-lle-His-Pro-Phe) - is a pleiotropic vasoacth/e peptide that binds to two distinct receptors: the Ang II type 1 (AT^and type 2 (AT2) receptors. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldostrone system (RAAS) results in vascular hypertrophy, vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, and hypertension. These effects are mediated predominantly by A^ receptors. Paradoxically, other Ang ll-mediated effects, including cell death, vasodilation, and natriuresis, are mediated by AT2 receptor activation. The understanding of Ang II signalling mechanisms remains incomplete. AT! receptor activation triggers a variety of intracellular systems, including tyrosine kinase-induced protein phosphorylation, production ofarachidonic acid metabolites, alteration of reactive oxidant species activities, and fluxes in intracellular Ca2* concentrations. AT2 receptor activation leads to stimulation of bradykinin, nitric oxide production, and prostaglandin metabolism, which are, in large part, opposite to the effects of the ATj receptor. (See: Berry C, Touyz R, Dominiczak AF, Webb RC, Johns DG.: Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2001 Dec;281(6):H2337-65. Angiotensin receptors: signalling, vascular pathophysiology, and interactions with ceramide).<br>
Ang II is the active component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). It plays an important physiological role in the regulation of blood pressure, plasma volume, sympathetic nervous activity, and thirst responses. Ang II also has a pathophysiological role in cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver fibrosisand atherosclerosis. It is produced systemically via the classical RAAS and locally via tissue RAAS. In the classical RAAS, circulating renal-derived renin cleaves hepatic-derived angiotensinogen to form the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I), which is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs to the active Ang II. Ang I can also be processed into the heptapeptide Ang-(1-7) by tissue endopeptidases. The RAAS system is illustrated schematically in Figure 1 hereto which is based on Figure 1 in the article by Foote et al. in Ann.. Pharmacother. 27:1495-1503 (1993).<br>
In addition to the RAAS playing an important role in the normal cardiovascular homeostasis, over activity of the RAAS has been implicated in the development of various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary ischemia and renal insufficiency. After myocardial infarction (Ml), RAAS becomes activated. Specifically the ATi receptor seems to play a prominent role in post-Mi remodelling, since ATi receptor<br><br>
expression is increased after Ml and in left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore drugs that interfere with RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors and A"^ receptor antagonists, have been shown to be of great therapeutic benefit in the treatment of such cardiovascular disorders.<br>
For heart, kidneys, lungs and liver alike, fibrosis represents a common pathway to their failure. Understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in organ fibrosis is therefore of considerable interest, particularly given the potential for protective pharmacological strategies. Tissue repair involves inflammatory cells, including members of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, integral to initiating the repair process; and myofibroblasts, phenotypically transformed interstitial fibroblasts, responsible for collagen turnover and fibrous tissue formation. Each of these cellular events in the microenvironment of repair are associated with molecular events that lead to the de novo generation of angiotensin II (Ang II). In an autocrine/paracrine manner, this peptide regulates expression of TGF-beta 1 via angiotensin (ATi) receptor-ligand binding. It is this cytokine that contributes to phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (myoFb) and regulates myofibroblast turnover of collagen. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or ATt receptor antagonism each prevent many of these molecular and cellular responses that eventuate in fibrosis and therefore have been found to be protective interventions.<br>
(See: Weber KT. Fibrosis, a common pathway to organ failure: angiotensin II and tissue repair. Semin Nephrol. 1997 Sep;17(5):467-91 and references therein).<br>
Ang II may regulate tissue fibrosis via the activation of mesenchymal cells. For example, Ang II stimulates the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts in vitro via activation of AT,. The presence<br>
' of AT, receptors has also been demonstrated on cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Most of the profibrotic effects of Ang II appear to be mediated via this receptor; however, increased AT2<br>
.   expression on cardiac fibroblasts has been detected in hypertrophied human heart, and the balance between the expressions of these two subtypes may be critical in determining the response to Ang II.<br>
(See: Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., Volume 161, Number 6, June 2000,1999-2004Angiotensin II Is Mitogenic for Human Lung Fibroblasts via Activation of the Type 1 Receptor Richard P. Marshall, Robin J. McAnulty, and Geoffrey J. Laurent and references therein).<br>
The Ang II receptors can be distinguished according to inhibition by specific antagonists. ATi receptors are selectively antagonized by biphenylimidazoles, such as Losartan, whereas tetrahydroimidazopyridines specifically inhibit AT2 receptors. The AT2 receptor may also be selectively activated byCGP-42112A. This is a hexapeptide analog of Ang II, which mayalso inhibit the AT2 receptor, depending on concentration). Two other angiotensin receptors have been described: AT3 and AT4 subtypes.<br>
In rodents, the A^ receptor has two functionally distinct subtypes, AT1A and ATiB, with &gt;95% amino acid sequence homology.<br><br>
The second major angiotensin receptor isoform is the AT2 receptor. It has low amino acid sequence homology (-34%) with AT1A or AT^ receptors. Although the exact signalling pathways and the functional roles of AT2 receptors are unclear, these receptors may antagonize, under physiological conditions, ATrmediated actions inhibiting cell growth and by inducing apoptosis and vasodilation. The exact role of AT2 receptors in cardiovascular disease remains to be defined.<br>
Other receptors for Ang II besides ATi and AT2 are known and are generally referred to as i (see Kang et al., Am. Heart J. 127: 1388-1401 (1994)). '<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
WO 98/18496 (Nycomed Imaging AS) discloses contrast agents comprising Ang ll-receptor<br>
antagonists labelled for in vivo imaging.<br>
US patent no. 5,138,069 discloses substituted imidazoles for use as Ang II receptor blockers. Further, US patent no. 5,264,581 (Cariani) discloses radioiodinated imidazole Ang II antagonists.<br>
The present invention<br>
It has now been found that Ang ll-receptor antagonists such as e.g. Losartan, Valsartan, Candesartan and Eprosartan and derivatives thereof labelled with a moiety or moieties detectable in vivo are useful diagnostic imaging agents for in vivo imaging of a human or animal body.<br>
The contrast agents of the present invention are useful in imaging of Ang II receptor sites in vivo i.e. using targeted contrast agents in which the targeting vector has affinity for Ang ll-receptor sites. The Ang II receptors are generally located within the cardiovascular system and are accessible to such contrast agents when they are administered into the blood stream. Accordingly, using such targeted contrast agents it is possible to detect diseases and disorders such as heart failure, atherosclerosis and restricted blood flow, as well as other vascular diseases and disorders, and diseases where fibrosis is prominent, and also to monitor the progression of treatment for such diseases and disorders.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a contrast agent as defined by formula I,<br>
wherein V is a non-peptidic vector having affinity for the Angiotensin ll-receptor, L represents a bond, a spacer or linker and Z represents a moiety detectable in an in vivo imaging procedure of a human or animal body.<br><br>
The vector V is a non-peptidic targeting moiety having affinity for the Ang II receptor. V further represents an imidazole Ang II anatagonist such as e.g. Losartan, Valsartan, Caldesartan and Eprosartan and derivatives thereof.<br>
The role of the linker L is to couple vector to the imaging moiety, and where L is a spacer moiety the role of L is to distance a relatively bulky imaging moiety, Z, from the active site of the vector, V.<br>
A linker moiety may serve to link one vector to one imaging moiety; alternatively it may link together more than one vector and/or more than one imaging moiety. Likewise an imaging moiety or a vector may be linked to more than one linker. Use in this way of a plurality of imaging moieties (e.g. several linker-imaging moieties attached to one vector or several imaging moieties attached to one linker itself attached to one vector) may enable the detectability of the contrast agent to be increased (e.g. by increasing its radioopacity, echogenicity or relaxivity) or may enable it to be detected in more than one imaging modality. Use in this way of a plurality of vectors may e.g. increase the targeting efficiency of a contrast agent or may make the contrast agent/therapeutic agent able to target more than one site, e.g. different receptors for an agent which has receptor heterogeneity.<br>
The linker moiety L may be a simple bond, glutaric acid, diglycolic acid, PEG units, PEG-like linkers or may be represented by other linkers well known in the art, e.g. as described in WO 01/77145 pages 23-27, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference. L may also be represented by a combination of the linker units.<br>
The imaging moieties (Z) in the compounds of the invention may be any moiety capable of detection either directly or indirectly in an in vivo diagnostic imaging procedure.<br>
For Pharmaceuticals useful in diagnosis and particularly in in vivo diagnosis the moiety Z must be able to carry the imageable moiety or moieties denoted M. By carrying is meant any form of association between the moiety Z and M such as a chemical bond, e.g. covalent bond or electrovalent or ionic bonds or by absorption or any other kind of association.<br>
Chelating agent of formula (II) and (e) hereafter are particularly preferred.<br>
M can be any imageable moiety. The nature of M will depend of the imaging modality utilised in the diagnosis. M must be capable of detection either directly or indirectly in an in vivo diagnostic imaging procedure, eg. moieties which emit or may be caused to emit detectable radiation (eg. by radioactive decay, fluorescence excitation, spin resonance excitation, etc.), moieties which affect local electromagnetic fields (eg. paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic species), moieties which absorb or scatter radiation energy<br><br>
(eg. chromophores, particles (including gas or liquid containing vesicles), heavy elements and compounds thereof, etc.), and moieties which generate a detectable substance (eg. gas microbubble generators).<br>
A wide range of suitable imageable moieties are known from e.g. WO 98/18496, the content of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
Imaging modalities and imageable moieties M are described in more detail hereinafter<br>
In a first embodiment, the compound of formula (I) comprises a moiety Z carrying one or more imageable moieties M useful in the Radio and SPECT imaging modality. Preferably M is a gamma emitter with low or no alpha- and beta-emission and with a half-life of more than one hour. Preferred groups M are the radionuclides <br>
When M denotes a metallic radionuclide then Z comprises a chelating agent suitable for forming a stable chelate with M. Such chelating agents are well known from the state of art and typical examples of such chelating agents are described in Table I of WO 01/77145.<br>
Particularly preferred are chelating agents of Formula II<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
where:<br>
each R1, R2, R3 and R4 is independently an R group;<br>
each R group is independently H or C^o alkyl, C^o alkylaryl, C2.io alkoxyalkyl, C,.10<br>
hydroxyalkyl, Ci.i0alkylamine, d-iofluoroalkyl, or 2 or more R groups, together with the<br>
atoms to which they are attached form a carbocyclic, heterocyclic, saturated or unsaturated<br>
ring.<br><br>
More preferred are chelating agent represented by formulas a, b, c and d.<br><br>

An even more preferred example a chelating agent is represented by formula e, herein denoted cPn216. Most preferred for Z is when the chelating agent is cPn216 and imaging moiety M is 89mTc<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
Conjugates comprising chelating agents of Formula II can be radiolabelled to give good radiochemical purity, RCP, at room temperature, under aqueous conditions at near neutral pH. An advantage of radiolabelling the conjugates at room temperature is a simplified procedure in a hospital pharmacy. For the synthesis of chelating agent of formula (I it is referred to WO 03/006070, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Non-metal radionuclides such as 1231,125I and 131I may be covalently linked to the moiety Z a substitution or addition reaction well known from the state of art.<br>
In a second embodiment, the compound of formula (I) comprises a moiety Z carrying one • more imageable moieties M useful in the PET imaging modality. M then denotes a radioemitter with positron-emitting properties. Preferred groups M are the radionuclides 11( 18F, ^Ga, 13N, 15O and 82Rb. 18F is specifically preferred.<br>
When M denotes a metallic radionuclide then Z comprises a chelating agent suitable for forming a stable chelate with M. Such chelating agents are well known from the state of ar and typical examples of such chelating agents are described in Table I of WO 01/77145 ar to the previous part on Radio and SPECT imaging.<br>
In another preferred embodiment Z is the DOTA chelating agent and M is ^Ga which can readily introduced in to the chelate using microwave chemistry.<br>
Non-metal radionuclides such as 18F may be covalently linked to the moiety Z by a substitution or addition reaction well known from the state of art and also described eg. in WO03/080544 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a third embodiment, the compound of formula (I) comprises a moiety Z carrying one or more imageable moieties M useful in the MR imaging modality. M here denotes a paramagnetic metal such those mentioned in US patent 4,647,447, Gd3+, Dy3*' Fe3+and IV are particularly preferred and Z comprises a chelating agent, in particular a chelating agen such as acyclic or cyclic polyaminocarboxylates (e.g. DTPA, DTPA-BMA, DOTA and DO3^ as described e.g. in US patent 4,647,447 and WO 86/02841. M may also denote metal oxi such as superparamagnetic, ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic species which are absorbed b; e.g. such that Z function as a coating to the metal oxide. Metal oxides for use as MR contn agents are described e.g. in US patent 6,230,777 which is hereby incorporated by referenc<br>

M here denotes a heavy metal such as W, Au and Bi preferably in the form of oxides which may be absorbed to Z. lodinated aryl derivatives are particularly well known as X-ray contrast agents, e.g. lopamiron™ and Omnipaque™.<br>
Ultrasound imaging agents in the form of gas filled microvesicles can be utilised in the imaging of receptors e.g. when they are functionalised for binding to the vector V as described in the state of art e.g. in WO98/18500.<br><br>
The imaging moiety Z may also represent a chromophore to be used in light imaging<br>
procedure. By chromophore is meant a group in a composition of matter, e.g. an organic or<br>
inorganic group which absorbs and/or emits light.<br>
By light is meant electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths from 300-1300 nm.<br>
Chromophores having absorption and/or emission maxima in the visible to far infrared range<br>
are particularly relevant.<br>
Use of contrast agents for optical imaging with affinity for biological targets can further be<br>
provided following the procedures in the state of art e.g. as described in WO 96/17628 which<br>
is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
The invention may be exemplified by Losartan derivatives and is based on attachment of linker (L) and imaging moieties (Z) to the imidazol 5-position. The principle also applies to other compounds having structural similarities, e.g. Valsartan, Candesartan and Eprosartan, possessing suitable anchoring sites in the part of the molecule corresponding to the Losartan imidazole ring.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
Scheme 1 shows an example of how the imidazole 5-position can be used to anchor a chelating agent of formula e to give a derivatised Losartan molecule for Tc-chelation. Parent Losartan molecule is transformed to the azide-derivative followed by reduction to the corresponding amine. The amine is reacted with diglycolic anhydride, followed by activation and reaction with a suitable derivative of the chelating agent of formula e.<br><br>
