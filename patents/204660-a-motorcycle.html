DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD TO WHICH THE INVENTION BELONGS]<br>
The present invention relates to an arranging construction of an engine intake system and a housing box of a motorcycle.<br>
[PRIOR ART]<br>
In some of motorcycles, an engine and a housing box are arranged under a seat as in a scooter type motorcycle. For the motorcycle of this kind, there has been known, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2525573 Publication "Air cleaner case for a scooter type vehicle" (hereinafter referred to as "prior art").<br>
In the aforementioned prior art, as shown in FIG. 2 of the Publication thereof, an air cleaner case 29 is arranged at the rear of an engine body 25 (numeral is cited from those described in the<br><br><br>
Publication, and the same is true for the following) , chambers 41 and 42 are arranged in front of the engine body 25, the chamber 42 is connected to the air cleaner case 29 through a connecting tube 37, the chamber 41 is provided integral with the chamber 42, and an intake port of the engine body 25 is connected to the chamber 41 through a carburetor 27.<br>
Further, in the aforementioned prior art, as shown in FIG. 1 of the Publication, a power unit 13 having a power transmission device incorporated in the engine is mounted on a body frame 2 under a tandem seat 24 so as to be swung up and down.<br>
[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]<br>
In the aforementioned prior art, preferably, the engine intake systems such as the air cleaner case 29 and the chambers 41 and 42 are of a relatively large capacity in order to sufficiently exhibit the performance of the engine body 25.<br>
Incidentally, in the scooter type motorcycle as in the aforementioned prior art, a housing box not shown is often arranged under the tandem seat 24. Preferably, the housing box is also large in housing capacity in term of a role. However, an arranging space under the seat is limited. When the large capacity engine intake systems and the large capacity housing box are arranged under the seat, the tandem seat 24 is unavoidably raised in order to secure the arranging space. The tandem seat 24 cannot be raised or lowered simply due to the foot-landing performance.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide the technique capable of increasing the capacity of an engine intake<br><br>
system or the capacity of a housing box without making a height of a seat higher.<br>
[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM]<br>
For achieving the aforementioned object, according to claim 1, there is provided a motorcycle in which a crank case, an engine with a cylinder extended forward from the crank case, and a housing box are arranged under a seat, characterized in that an intake passage is extended rearward from an upper part of the cylinder, an air chamber arranged above the crank case is connected to an intake port of the intake passage, the housing box is arranged rearward of the air chamber, an air cleaner is arranged sideways of the housing box, and the air cleaner and the air chamber are connected by a communication path.<br>
The cylinder is extended forward from the crank case, a space above the crank case can be secured. The air chamber is arranged in this surplus space, the housing box is arranged in the surplus space rearward of the air chamber, and the air cleaner is arranged in the surplus space sideways of the housing box. Further, the surplus space above the cylinder is utilized to extend the intake passage rearward from the above of the cylinder, and the air chamber is connected to the intake port of the intake passage. And the air cleaner is connected to the air chamber by the communication path.<br>
As described above, the engine intake system comprising the air cleaner, the communication path, the air chamber and the intake passage, and the housing box can be arranged effectively making use of the surplus space under the seat.<br><br>
