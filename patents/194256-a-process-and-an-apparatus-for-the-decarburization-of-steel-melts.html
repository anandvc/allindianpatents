A process for decarburizing steel melt in a closed metallurgical vessel that is connected to a vacuum unit.<br>
In the so-called forced decarburization, it is known for oxygen to be added during the decarburization phase. This addition of oxygen is always necessary in cases when the oxygen present in the steel is not sufficient for decarburization purposes, or is so low that the removal of carbon is not completed in the time available. In a process of this kind, for example, immersion pipes of an RH-vessel are dipped into the melt. The decarburization process starts at the same time as the commencement of the reduction in pressure, as a factor depending on the lowering in pressure. When a negative pressure of p 
In the course of decarburization, up to 70 % of CO is formed. Part of this gas<br>
automatically reacts with parts of the oxygen added to form CO2. The degree of<br>
afterburning with this type	<br><br>
of operation is less than 30 %.<br>
It is also common practice in the field of metallurgy to use aluminium for chemically heating steel melts in atmospheric plants. In this chemical heating procedure, the energy yield resulting from the combustion of the aluminium with the added oxygen is used to heat the melt.<br>
In addition to the purely thermal heating using aluminium, it is possible for the latter to be used together with other matter for treating the melt. Thus, a process for treating steel in the ladle with reactive slags is known from EP 0 110 809, a metallothermic reaction being provided in said process, in which a lance is used to inject oxygen into a bubble cap which is dipped into the melt, combustible metallic materials react, forming reactive slags, and a neutral or reducing circulation gas is injected below the pipe in which the steel treatment is taking place.<br>
The drawback of this process involving desulphurization, deoxidation and cleaning reactions in respect of steel melts is the formation of the reactive slags which takes place in the bubble cap which is dipped into the liquid metal.<br>
In addition, a process for degassing and decarburization of molten steel is known from EP 0 347 884 Bl, in which steel is directed from a container into a vacuum chamber, an oxygen lance being arranged at a predetermined spacing, in said vacuum<br><br>
chamber, from which lance oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas is injected for the combustion of the CO in the vicinity of the surface of the molten steel disposed in the vacuum chamber. Taking into consideration a predetermined ratio of (CO + CO2) / quantity of waste gas or CO / (CO + CO2)., oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas is injected by a lance for the combustion of CO in the vicinity of the surface of the molten steel disposed in the vacuum chamber.<br>
In connection with this process, no mention is made of a chemical heating of the melt under specific pressure conditions and injecting a defined excess quantity of oxygen.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a process and a suitable apparatus for the decarburization of a steel melt, in which, while ensuring a high degree of oxidic purity, the decarburization time is reduced and/or the final carbon content is reduced.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a process for the decarburization of steel melts in a closed metallurgical vessel which is connected to a vacuum plant and into which oxygen is designed to be injected via a lance and combustible material is designed to be introduced via a feeding device, which process includes the following steps:<br>
a) once the vessel is filled with melt and after continuous lowering of the pressure to below 100 mbar, a predeterminable quantity of excess oxygen is<br><br>
injection in addition to supplementary oxygen which is used during the decarburization phase for carrying out the combustion of carbon, and b) when there is a partial oxygen surplus, metallic combustible material is added in a uniformly distributed manner.<br>
The metallic combustible material may be aluminium powder or aluminium grit or a mixture of combustible material, e.g. Al, Fe, Si, Mn. The metallic combustible material may be added discontinuously in portions. The excess oxygen may be injected during the first 10 minutes injection time, once the pressure is below p = 100 mbar.<br>
The' invention further provides an apparatus for the decarburization of steel melts, comprising a sealable vessel which is connected to a vacuum plant and into an interior of which gases and granular solid material are designed to be fed via supply means, for carrying out the process according to claim 1, in which measuring elements are provided in the sealable vessel for detecting the melt temperature or pressure, which elements are connected, via a measuring and controlling instrument, to control means for supplying oxygen and metallic combustible material.<br>
In the above apparatus, the sealable vessel may be a vacuum vessel which is provided with a cover and in which a metallurgical vessel is designed to be placed in position, in<br><br>
which a lance, which is provided with a measuring element and projects into the melt disposed in the metallurgical vessel, is designed to be directed through the cover, and in which supply pipes for oxygen and metallic combustible material project through the cover, the control means being arranged on said supply pipes.<br>
In the above apparatus, the sealable vessel may be designed to be an RH-vessel, the supply and discharge pipes of which dip into the melt disposed in a metallurgical vessel, and in which the control means are connected to shut-off means which are arranged in supply pipes for oxygen and/or combustible material.<br>
In the above apparatus, a bubble cap may be provided and is directed through a cover which seals off the vessel opening of the metallurgical vessel, projecting into the melt, and in which apparatus supply pipes for oxygen and metallic combustible material are provided, which pipes project into an interior of the bubble cap and on which are arranged control means which control shut-off means.<br>
A combination lance may be provided and in it are arranged the supply pipes for oxygen and/or metallic combustible material.<br>
In addition to the supply pipe for metallic combustible material in the combination lance, a pipe may be provided to project into the vessel for supplying, in particular, coarse<br><br>
solid material from a container.<br>
According to the invention, in addition to the supplementary-oxygen used during the decarburization phase for carrying out the removal of the carbon, additional oxygen is injected and, simultaneously, metallic combustible material is added and distributed.<br>
In known vacuum plants, only killed cast (Al, Si or Al-Si deoxidation) melts or rimmed cast melts (decarburization melts) were previously chemically heated after completed decarburization and subsequent deoxidation. The reason was the reduction of the oxygen required for decarburization when adding the heating aluminium. The energy yield, which results from the reaction from the combustion of the aluminium with the added oxygen, is used. In this process, however, the decarburization reaction was slowed down considerably, and the anticipated decarburization oxygen was not obtained.<br>
According to the invention, this drawback is circumvented and the drop in temperature occurring during decarburization is compensated for by the heating operation using aluminium or similar products. With the suggested addition of oxygen, a time-limited partial oxygen surplus arises in the melt. Partial oxygen surplus is the additional oxygen which is additionally required during the decarburization of rimmed cast melts in vacuum plants for the combustion of metallic combustible material or mixtures of combustible materials.<br><br>
without thereby adversely affecting the decarburization process. This surplus manifests positive thermodynamic and kinetic effects and, in a surprising manner, assists the decarburization process. The decarburization reaction [C] + [0] = (CO) , which is not only highly pressure-dependent but especially also temperature-dependent, is accelerated in that the superheating of part of the melt, in particular in the RH--vessel, briefly occurring during the chemical heating procedure, has a catalytic effect on the decarburization reaction.<br>
In addition, it is possible, in particular, for the chemical heating agent, for example in the form of aluminium grit, to be used to accelerate the decarburization process. This, because, in addition to the thermodynamic effect, the kinetics of the reaction are influenced by the AI2O3 particles formed during heating. These deoxidation products serve as foreign nuclei and are thus capable of forcing the rate of decarburization, in particular by forming CO bubbles.<br>
In an advantageous further development, a combination lance is used for conveying the oxygen and the metallic combustible material. In the event of particularly granular material, it is suggested that this be fed into the vessel through a separate pipe.<br>
Applying this process, it is possible to provide any partial temperature increase during a decarburization procedure under<br><br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides an apparatus for decarburization of steel as described above, comprising a scalable vessel provided with a cover member connected to a vacuum plant, said cover having a supply means for the supply of oxygen and metallic combustible material, said supply means being provided with control means, a metallurgical vessel positioned within said isealable vessel, a lance with measuring elements projecting into the melt disposed within said vessel, said measuring elements are provided with temperature and pressure detecting means and said control means are provided with means to control the supply of oxygen and metallic combustible material into said metallurgical vessel.<br>

The RH-vessel is connected to a vacuum plant 41 via a suction pipe 42. In addition to the combination lance 31, a pipe 38, for the supply, in particular, of coarse solid material,, projects into<br><br>
•the RH-vessel, and this pipe is in communication with a container 36 via a shut-off means 37. The measuring and controlling device and the control device are the same as illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
