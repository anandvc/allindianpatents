				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to allocating connectivity solutions for network elements.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a method of finding connectivity<br>
solutions for network elements to be switched into a path selected in a network<br>
managed by a network management system. The invention further relates to a<br>
network management system implementing the method of finding connectivity<br>
solutions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modern telecommunication networks comprise huge numbers of network nodes<br>
(network elements), and a great number of the nodes are switching elements<br>
such as cross-connects having a complex system of input and output: ports. Each<br>
of the input and output ports usually comprises a plurality of connections and is<br>
characterized by various functions. For example, some output ports may serve<br>
for dropping portions of a signal, while other output ports provide a throughput<br>
of the inputted signal. The switching elements not only comprise various types of<br>
ports and connections, but usually have particular equipment limitations so that<br>
not each and every input connector can work with an arbitrary output connector<br>
of the same or other switching element in the network. There may be a number<br>
of reasons for such limitations, including differences in protocols, physical<br>
characteristics, incompatible locations in space, preferred or non-preferred<br>
connections, cost-related limitations etc.<br>
For solving various tasks related to finding appropriate connections in the<br>
modern networks, the following hierarchy of management systems is usually<br>
provided and utilized.<br>
a Network Management System (NMS) of the network, NMS having a<br>
network-wide view i.e., possessing information on types of all existing<br>
network nodes and their connections at the current moment,<br>
an Element Management System (EMS) of a particular network element,<br>
EMS having an element-wide view i.e., holding information on various<br>
types of connections the network element (node) comprises, and on<br>
various equipment limitations the network element has.<br>
The NMS sees the network as a current configuration of the network<br>
nodes and may contact any node by contacting its EMS.<br>
When a path is to be found between two points in the network} a<br>
program usually called pathfinder applies to the NMS for allocating such<br>
a path between the available network elements. Upon finding a<br>
preliminary path which, for example, is determined as a shortest path, a<br>
detailed connectivity pattern should be found via the elements planned for<br>
the path. To do that, the NMS applies to EMS of each node in the paths to<br>
allocate specific connectivity solutions.<br>
A similar method is described in EP 1130942A2, where the<br>
network manager queries a resource management mechanism to allocate<br>
an output port for an input port in an optical packet switching apparatus.<br>
The resource management mechanism then applies to a port availability<br>
database of a switching element, and upon reserving a spare output port,<br>
the optical switch control mechanism is activated.<br>
The iterations between the NMS and each of the EMS are time<br>
consuming, require multiple exchange of protocols. Sometimes, the<br>
connectivity solution for a particular node cannot be found due to any of<br>
its equipment limitations unknown to the NMS, and a substantive portion<br>
of the pathfinder process must be repeated i.e., a number of searches,<br>
performed by the NMS in interaction with EMS, increases. As a result,<br>
the process requires more time and is inefficient.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide such a<br>
technology for finding connectivity solutions in a network comprising a<br>
great number of switching network elements and NMS, which enables<br>
effectively performing it at the NMS level.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In order to reduce the time required for finding connectivity<br>
solutions in network elements, NMS (Network Management System)<br>
may comprise a centralized connectivity database or table formed from<br>
component connectivity databases of a plurality of the network elements.<br>
Each of the component connectivity databases can be copied from EMS<br>
(Element Management System) of the corresponding network element. In<br>
such a case, the NMS will exactly "know" the structure of each and every<br>
network element.<br>
In the present application, the term NMS should be understood as a<br>
managing entity responsible for management of a particular group of<br>
network elements forming a network or part thereof.<br>
In other words, the object of the invention can be achieved2cby<br>
providing a method of finding connectivity solutions for network<br>
elements to be switched into a path selected in a network managed by a<br>
network management system (NMS), wherein each network element<br>
comprises input ports and output ports, each of the ports enabling a<br>
plurality of connection points, the method including providing, at the<br>
level of NMS, a connectivity table (CT) comprising data on possible<br>
internal connections between connection points of any input port and any<br>
output port of any of the network elements managed bv said NMS,<br>
thereby enabling, whenever a particular network element is selected with<br>
its input port and its output port to be used in the path, obtaining a<br>
connectivity solution for said particular network element at the level of<br>
NMS.<br>
The method also comprises continuous updating the NMS by the<br>
EMS of the respective managed network elements concerning any<br>
changes in the component connectivity tables, for example, concerning<br>
availability of particular connection points.<br>
However, to reduce the memory required for storing such a tablo in<br>
NMS, the object of the invention can be achieved without "knowing"<br>
each particular network element by the NMS. by performing the<br>
following steps:<br>
- classifying connection points of both the input ports and the output<br>
ports of all network elements into a number of connection groups<br>
marked 1, 2, 3 ...n, wherein each of the groups is characterized by<br>
similar properties and/or limitations<br>
- assigning one or more of said connection groups to each input port<br>
and each output port of a particular network element,<br>
forming the connectivity table to represent common connectivity<br>
rules stating possibility of creating connection between any arbitrary<br>
connection group of the 1, 2, 3...n belonging to an input port of a<br>
network element and any arbitrary connection group of the 1, 2, 3... n<br>
belonging to an output port of the network element,<br>
thereby enabling, whenever a particular network element is selected with<br>
its input port and its output port to be used in the path, obtaining a<br>
connectivity solution for said particular network element at the level of<br>
NMS, by applying the connectivity rules to the connection groups<br>
assigned to the selected input and output ports.<br>
It goes without saying that the above method is universal for any of<br>
the network elements managed by the NMS.<br>
According to the preferred, version of the method, it comprises<br>
arranging the connectivity table (CT) so that rows of the table being the<br>
connection groups 1, 2, ... n of the input ports, columns of the table are<br>
the connection groups 1,2, ...n of the output ports, and each intersection<br>
cell between a particular row and a specific column comprises<br>
information about a possibility of creating an internal connection between<br>
a connection point belonging to said particular group of the input ports<br>
and a connection point belonging to said specific group of the output<br>
ports.<br>
It should be emphasized that, in the preferred version of the present<br>
invention, the NMS does not have to know (store) the connectivity<br>
structure of each and every network element (NE). Instead, it stores a<br>
single and relatively small connectivity table (CT) which is built to reflect<br>
common connectivity rules in the network elements and thus effectively<br>
assists in finding real connectivity solutions. Some additional information<br>
might be held in the NMS, which will be mentioned later on.<br>
According to a further, more elaborated version of the method, the<br>
method comprises:<br>
- applying to the NMS, by indicating a particular network element with<br>
its input port and its output port required for the selected path, to find<br>
a connectivity solution for said network element,<br>
- checking in NMS which connection groups of said 1, 2, ...n are<br>
present in said input port, and which - in said output port,<br>
applying the connectivity rules by using said connectivity table (CT)<br>
at the NMS to define, whether the desired connection can be<br>
accomplished between at least one group of the input port's<br>
connection groups and at least one group of the output port's<br>
connection groups;<br>
- if in the affirmative, considering the connectivity solution to be found<br>
and<br>
- applying from the NMS to an Element Management System (EMS) of<br>
the particular network element to activate a specific internal<br>
connection in the element,<br>
- if in the negative, issuing a message from the NMS that no<br>
connectivity solution is found for the indicated said input port and said<br>
output port of the NE.<br>
The selection of the NE with its ports for a path can be performed,<br>
say, by a Pathfinder program forming part of the NMS. If no connectivity<br>
solution is found for the NE selected by the Pathfinder, it should be<br>
accordingly informed.<br>
The above version of the method demonstrates that only the lower<br>
level operation (activation of the internal connection) is performed at the<br>
network element level, and there are practically no iterations from the<br>
element (EMS) level to the NMS level. Would the principal solution on<br>
the connectivity between an input port and an output port of a particular<br>
network element (NE) be taken at the level of NE, there would be many<br>
iterative communications between EMS and NMS.<br>
The task of finding connectivity solutions for network elements an<br>
be almost completely resolved at the level of NMS, so that only<br>
activation of the internal connection is left to the level of EMS, due to the<br>
fact that at the level of NMS, there is already all information concerning<br>
connection groups associated to each particular port in each NE, and all<br>
the information on possible connectivity between any of the "input"<br>
connection groups and any of the "output" connection groups.<br>
The method, in particular the step of applying the connectivity<br>
rules, may further comprise a step of pointing out, at the level of NMS,<br>
an internal connection between a contact point from the input connection<br>
group and a contact point from the output connection group, wherein said<br>
input connection group and said output connection group are selected at<br>
the level of NMS for a particular network element as a connectivity<br>
solution.<br>
The search for a connectivity solution (either using the CT<br>
composed from the component connectivity tables, or using the CT of<br>
common connectivity rules) may be terminated by checking information<br>
on busy connections. In particular, it can be made by preliminary<br>
providing and further referring to a data base of busy connections (or a<br>
so-called hash table HT) in the NMS, indicating internal connections<br>
which are presently occupied in the network elements. The HT is<br>
composed of a plurality of Hash sub-tables assigned to respective<br>
'network elements. Each of the Hash sub-tables comprises only a list of<br>
busy internal connections of the element, and therefore is economical<br>
from the point of memory since there is no need in storing status of all<br>
possible real connections which might be arranged in the NE between all<br>
its input and output connection points.<br>
When using the CT of common connectivity rules, the step of<br>
checking information on busy connections may comprise preliminary<br>
providing and further referring to a data base for docketing a number of<br>
existing connection points in each connection group of a particular<br>
element; the pointing out being effected upon comparing information<br>
about existing connection points in the selected input and output<br>
connection groups with the information on busy connections.<br>
To explain the method in more detail, some information should be<br>
given on how the NMS is organized. From the request pointing out a<br>
particular selected network element, the NMS obtains indications on the<br>
element's input and output ports. For this purpose, any NMS holds its<br>
topological information, preferably in the form of a network graph. As<br>
has been mentioned before, the NMS comprises the Connectivity Table<br>
(CT) enabling to decide whether the selected ports are capable of creating<br>
an internal connection there-between. The Connectivity Table (CT) can<br>
be built from component connectivity tables of the managed network<br>
elements. If so, the CT "knows" all limitations of the connectivity points<br>
of these network elements and enables to find a connectivity solution at<br>
the level of the NMS.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
topologic information additionally describes which connection groups are<br>
present in which ports, concerning any of the network elements managed<br>
by the NMS. Optionally, the topological information may comprise<br>
docketing of existing connection points in each connection group of any<br>
port of a managed network element. Though this information is quite<br>
detailed, it is still far from the complete information on the network<br>
elements' internal structure as in some of the prior art solutions. The<br>
Connectivity Table (CT) of the NMS reflects common connectivity rules<br>
enabling to decide whether the selected ports (by virtue of the connection<br>
groups they comprise) are capable of creating an internal connection<br>
there-between. Actually, such a Connectivity Table takes into account<br>
and generalizes all limitations of the connectivity points, known to the<br>
managed network elements.<br>
Based on the above, and according to another aspect of the<br>
invention, there is provided an improved network management system<br>
(NMS) comprising a Connectivity Handler (CH) block enabling finding,<br>
at the level of NMS, connectivity solutions for a particular network<br>
element to be switched in a path selected over a network managed by the<br>
NMS, wherein the Connectivity Handler comprising a connectivity table<br>
(CT) holding data on possible internal connections within any of the<br>
network elements managed by said NMS.<br>
In one embodiment, the CT is composed from connectivity<br>
databases obtained from EMS of respective network elements.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the said NMS, the NMS<br>
comprises:<br>
- modified topologic data concerning the network elements of said<br>
network and their ports, wherein to each input port and to each output<br>
port of any network element there are respectively assigned one or<br>
more connection groups 1,2, ...n of connection points such that each<br>
connection group is characterized by similar features and/or<br>
limitations, and<br>
the CT comprises:<br>
common connectivity rules stating possibility of creating<br>
connection between any arbitrary connection group of the 1, 2, 3...n<br>
belonging to an input port of a network element and any arbitrary<br>
connection group of the 1, 2, 3... n belonging to an output port of the<br>
network element,<br>
the CT thereby enabling NMS, upon obtaining a request indicating a<br>
particular network element with a pair of desired input and output ports to<br>
be used in a selected path, to determine whether there is a connectivity<br>
solution in said network element.<br>
The connectivity table (CT) is preferably arranged so that rows ®f<br>
the table are the connection groups 1,2, ... n belonging to input ports,<br>
and columns of the table are the connection groups 1, 2, ... n belonging to<br>
output ports, and each intersection cell between a particular row and a<br>
specific column comprising information concerning a possibility of<br>
creating an internal connection between at least one connection point<br>
from the connection group belonging to an input port of a network<br>
element, and at least one connection point from the connection group<br>
belonging to an output port of said network element<br>
Optionally, the Connectivity Handler in the NMS may comprise a<br>
busy connections database (a so-called hash table) in the form of<br>
information strings, each indicating internal connections which are<br>
currently busy in a particular network element of the network. Each string<br>
is intended for one busy connection, wherein the strings belonging to one<br>
network element forming a hash-sub-table of that element.<br>
In case the CT is built for groups of contact points, the modified<br>
topological data may optionally comprise a data base for docketing a<br>
number of existing connection points in each connection group of each<br>
port of each particular element. To point out a real connection, the CH<br>
should then be capable of comparing information about existing<br>
connection points in the selected input and output connection groups with<br>
the information on busy connections.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is also<br>
provided a computer program product directly loadable into the internal<br>
memory of a digital computer, comprising software code portions for<br>
performing the steps of the above-described method when said product is<br>
run on the computer.<br>
The computer program product, stored on a computer usable<br>
medium, comprises computer readable program means for causing a<br>
computer to control execution of functions of the Network Management<br>
System as described above.<br>

Detailed description of exemplary embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a known type of interaction between NMS and EMS for finding a<br>
connectivity solution in a network element selected to form part of a path in a<br>
network (not shown). NMS (Network Management System) is marked 10, and<br>
comprises a pathfinder program (marked 12) and data on the network topology<br>
(marked 14), which is usually built as a graph reflecting the existing network<br>
elements, ports and arrangement of the elements in the network. The<br>
pathfinder's function is to select a path in the network according to a number of<br>
conditions and based on the network topology, and to form in the NMS a request<br>
indicating particular network elements and ports thereof which are to be utilized<br>
(i.e., the selected input port and the selected output port). The information on<br>
the selected ports are then transmitted from the NMS to EMS (Element<br>
Management System) of each element selected for the path (the EMS blocks: 1,<br>
i....n are marked with 16) . The EMS of a particular network element looks for an<br>
internal connection between the selected input port and the selected output port<br>
using information, available in the ports and based on specific limitations known<br>
to the EMS. The limitations can be as follows: the selected ports may be<br>
available or not, connection points in the selected ports may be available or not,<br>
some available connection points may be prevented from using for the required<br>
type of connection, etc. The limitations and physical availability of connections<br>
can be reflected in a so-called port availability data associated with a particular<br>
port, and there are as many of such data(bases) in the EMS, as the number of<br>
ports in the element. After clearing up all availability questions, the relevant EMS<br>
will report to the<br>
NMS whether the connectivity solution is found. Interaction between the<br>
NMS and EMS may include multiple steps and is therefore time<br>
consuming. The path finding process is complex and long; when during<br>
the process there are stops for inquiring EMS, such interrups/interactions<br>
become time consuming.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a diagram reflecting interaction between a<br>
modified NMS and a number of EMSs according to one embodiment of<br>
the proposed invention. The modified NMS comprises a Connectivity<br>
Handler (CH) with a Connectivity Table (CT) which, in general, may be<br>
composed from connectivity tables of all respective EMSs in order to<br>
make connectivity decisions at the level of NMS. Dynamic update of the<br>
Connectivity Handler on limitations at the elements, for example - on<br>
changes in status of the connection ports/points can be provided and is<br>
marked by dotted lines.<br>
Preferably, all connection points existing in the ports of network elements<br>
(see also Fig. 3) managed by the NMS, are classified into connection<br>
groups. Each of the groups is characterized by specific properties and<br>
limitations. By doing that, a huge plurality of connection points of all the<br>
network elements are divided into a relatively small number of groups,<br>
each having a known behavior. The NMS 20 comprises a pathfinder -2.2,<br>
a modified topology data 24 which additionally holds information about<br>
specific connection groups which exist in (or are assigned to) each of the<br>
ports of the network elements.<br>
The modified NMS further comprises a new connectivity handler (CH)<br>
block 26 which comprises a connectivity table (CT) 28. One preferred<br>
example of the connectivity table is shown below in Fig. 4. The<br>
connectivity table 28 actually stores so-called common connectivity rules<br>
which, in order to formulate (at the level of NMS), whether and how the<br>
ports selected by the pathfinder can be interconnected, introduce terms of<br>
compatibility/incompatibility between connection groups of input and<br>
output ports. Since the connection groups of the connection points are<br>
formed over all the network, these terms of compatibility will apply to<br>
any network element having ports comprising any of such groups.<br>
The connectivity table CT (28) of the CH block (26), upon receiving<br>
information on connection groups existing in the selected ports of the<br>
element pointed out for a path, is capable of giving answers which<br>
connections are possible. This information may be forwarded too a<br>
corresponding EMS 32 for selecting a real internal connection and<br>
activating it. However, to minimize a chance that the desired connection<br>
will be busy, the NMS may apply to the EMS level only upon consulting<br>
with an optional block 30 of the connectivity handler 26. This block is<br>
called a hash table (HT) and registers only busy connections of each<br>
network element; it is continuously updated by the EMS l,...m. When a<br>
possible connection is allowed by CT and checked with the HT, an<br>
internal connection may actually be pointed out and transferred for<br>
activation to a corresponding EMS 32.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a network element 40 having a plurality of input<br>
ports 42 ( 1,... K) and a plurality of output ports 44 (1,...F). Each of the<br>
ports comprises connection points illustrated as circles and marked 46.<br>
All the connection points existing in the network elements, managed by<br>
the inventive NMS, are schematically divided into a number of<br>
connection groups 1, 2, ... n. Each of the groups is characterized by its<br>
particular limitations and behavior (properties, features) of the connection<br>
points.<br>
For example, connection points of a specific group positioned at input<br>
ports can be connected only to connection points of this same group<br>
positioned at output ports. In one case, connection points at an input port<br>
can be intended tor entering, into the network element such as cross-<br>
connect, virtual containers carrying data according to; the SDH/SONBT<br>
data transmission hierarchy. In such a case, the connection point can be<br>
called a VC point. In SDH switching equipment, the VC points are<br>
usually intended for inputting/outputting VC-4 data streams.<br>
Each port comprises connection points 46 belonging to one or more<br>
groups 48. For example, the Input Port 1 (marked 50) comprises<br>
connection points 46 belonging to three connection groups 48, namely to<br>
connection groups 1, 2 and 5. Each of the connection points within one<br>
group has its serial number or other indication.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an example of the preferred embodiment of a<br>
connectivity table (CT) 52, which comprises n columns 54 and n rows<br>
56, where each of the rows is assigned to a particular connection group of<br>
input ports or simply to "input connection groups", and each of the<br>
columns is assigned to a particular "output connection group". Symbols<br>
in the intersection of a particular row and a specific column have the<br>
meaning that an internal connection between the particular input<br>
connection group and the specific output connection group is either<br>
impossible or possible with or without some conditions.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a fragment of a data base of busy connections or a<br>
so-called hush sub-table 58 for a particular network element. The table<br>
does not have any standardized volume and comprises only strings 60<br>
which announce on currently busy connections in the network elements.<br>
The table is used as follows: upon finding a possible connectivity<br>
solution, say, between the input connection group 1 and the output<br>
connection group 2, NMS checks the hash sub-table of the element of<br>
interest to point out particular connection points to the EMS. Since the<br>
connection points 4 and 1 of the input connection group 1 are already<br>
busy, they will not be pointed out in the order. Also, connection point55<br>
of the output connection group 2 cannot be pointed out. It is assumed,<br>
that other connection points exist in the selected groups of the respective<br>
input and output ports of the required element, and they will be approved<br>
by EMS. However, the table will not be helpful if there is no extra<br>
connection points in the relevant groups, except for those already<br>
occupied. In this case, a negative response will be received from the EMS<br>
and, in this special case iterations will occur between the NMS and EMS.<br>
To avoid such a situation, the modified topology data may optionally<br>
comprise information on the total number of input contact points (output<br>
contact points) of each group in an input (output) port. This information<br>
would be compared with the information on busy connections in the<br>
hush-table to know exactly whether there is at least one available<br>
combination, and based on that comparison would produce a specified<br>
connectivity order to the EMS if the answer is positive, or prevent<br>
applying to the EMS if the answer is negative.<br>
While the present invention has been described using on a number of<br>
specific examples, one should appreciate that one might propose other<br>
implementations of a Network Management System capable of finding<br>
connectivity solutions for its managed network elements at the level of<br>
NMS by creating and using common connectivity rules, and modified<br>
methods of using such NMS, though all these implementations/methods<br>
