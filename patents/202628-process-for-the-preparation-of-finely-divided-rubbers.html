The invention relates to a process for the preparation of rubber powders, comprising fillers modified with organosilicon compounds, and the powders thus prepared.<br>
A large number of publications have appeared relating to the aim and purpose of the use of powdered rubbers and possible processes for their preparation.<br>
The explanation of the interest in pulverulent rubbers can readily be found from the processing techniques of the -rubber industry. There, rubber mixtures are prepared with a high expenditure on time, energy and personnel. The main reason for this is that the raw material rubber is present in the form of balls, and the other constituents of the vulcanizable mixture must be incorporated.<br>
Comminution of the balls and intimate mixing with fillers, mineral oil plasticizers and vulcanization auxiliaries takes place on mills in internal mixers in several process stages. Between the stages, the mixture is in general cooled on a batch-off line, deposited on pallets as rolled sheet and intermediately stored. The internal mixers or mills are followed by appropriate extruders or calendering processes.<br>
Only a completely new processing technology can lead away from this very involved technique of rubber processing. The use of free-flowing rubber powders has therefore been discussed for a relatively long time, because this results<br><br>
2<br>
in the possibility of being able to process rubber mixtures easily and quickly in the same way as thermoplastic powders.<br>
DE-PS 2822 148 discloses a process for the preparation of a pulverulent, filler-containing rubber.<br>
According to this patent specification, an aqueous filler emulsion is added to a rubber latex (e. g. natural rubber) a rubber solution (e. g. BR) or an aqueous emulsion of a synthetic rubber (e. g. SBR) and the desired rubber powder is precipitated out.<br>
To avoid the particle size-dependent filler contents obtained by this process, patents have been applied for relating to variants, which belong to the prior art as DE-PS 3723 213 and DE-PS 3723 214.<br>
According to DE-PS 3723213, in a process which proceeds in two stages, an amount of &gt;50 % of the filler is first integrated into the rubber powder particles. In the second step, the remainder of the filler is absorbed on to the so-called rubber base particles.<br>
This can be regarded as a variant of powdering, since no bond is formed between the filler and rubber.<br>
As E.T. Italiaander (Paper 151. Technische Tagung der Rubber Div. der ACS [Technical Conference of the Rubber Div. of the ACS], Anaheim, California, 6th - 9th May 1997 (GAK 6/1997 (50) 456-464) found, however, regardless of the great future predicted in the Delphi Report (Delphi Report "Kunftige Herstellverfahren in der Gummiindustrie [Future Production Processes in the Rubber Industry]" Rubber Journal, vol. 154, no. 11, 20-34 (1972)) for pulverulent and granulated rubber, and numerous attempts undertaken by<br><br>
3<br>
well-known polymer producers from the middle of the seventies into the early eighties to prepare pulverulent NBR, SBR-carbon black masterbatches and granulated NR, the standard delivery form of polymers has remained rubber balls.<br>
A disadvantage of the known processes on the one hand lies in the fact that a grinding operation is required in order to establish the particle diameter of the filler particles of 10 ?m regarded as necessary for the quality of the end product.<br>
However, this not only results in a high expenditure on energy, but also causes damage to the filler structure, which, in addition to the active surface area, is an important characteristic parameter for the effectiveness in use in rubbers.<br>
On the other hand, the ease of handling of the products according to the prior art suffers due to the particles sticking to one another during storage<br>
A precipitation process has now been applied for under number P 198 16 972.8, in which suspensions of fillers modified with organosilicon compounds are prepared and these are stirred into the rubber emulsion. The rubber powder is then precipitated out of this mixture.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a process which leads with few process stages to a rubber powder which can advantageously be employed and comprises modified fillers.<br><br>
4<br>
The invention provides a process for the preparation of finely divided rubbers (rubber powders) by precipitation from aqueous mixtures which comprise filler in the form of suspensions, water-soluble salts of a metal of groups IIa, IIb, IIIa and VIII of the periodic table of the elements and a rubber latex, an aqueous emulsion of a rubber or a rubber solution, which is characterized in that<br>
a)	one or more organosilicon compound(s) containing at<br>
least one alkoxy group is or are dissolved or<br>
emulsified, optionally in the presence of a surface-<br>
active substance, in water, or the compounds mentioned<br>
are mixed directly, optionally with a surface-active<br>
substance, with an aqueous suspension of an oxidic or<br>
silicatic finely divided filler or a mixture of these<br>
fillers at a temperature of 10 to 60 Â° C, preferably at<br>
room temperature, while stirring, the amount of this<br>
mixture envisaged for incoporation in the rubber, based<br>
on the filler content, in general being divided into two<br>
batches, and<br>
b)	a first batch is mixed with the polymer latex, the<br>
polymer emulsion or the polymer solution, the pH of this<br>
mixture is lowered to a pH of 6.0 to 4.5 with an acid,<br>
in particular a Lewis acid (first batch, first stage),<br>
c)	the remaining content (second batch, splitting amount)<br>
is added with further lowering of the pH to 4.5 to 2.6,<br>
in particular approx. 3.2 (second stage), so that the<br>
rubber in the mixture precipitates out together with the<br>
filler modified by organosilicon compound(s)<br><br>
5<br>
d)	the solid which has precipitated out is separated off by-<br>
measures known per se,<br>
e)	it is preferably washed, in order to adjust the pH to a<br>
value of approx. 6 to 7 which is more compatible with<br>
the further processing, and<br>
f)	the filler-containing rubber is dried.<br>
Drying is advantageously carried out in a drier at a gas intake temperature of 140 to 160Â°C and a gas discharge temperature of 50 to 70Â°C. The temperature of the product should not exceed 40 to 50 Â°C.<br>
The duration, which depends on the pH and the filler content, and the extent of the precipitating operation can easily be determined within a measurement series.<br>
In the case of a powdered rubber with a high filler content (&gt;80 parts of filler phr), 1 to 10 parts of this amount will in general be employed as the remaining content in the second stage in the precipitation of the powdered rubber.<br>
If the powdered rubber comprises less than 80 parts of filler phr, e. g. only 50 parts phr in total, &gt;10 to 20 parts of this amount is further introduced into the mixture in the form of a suspension before the conclusion of the precipitating operation.<br>
The fillers are bonded into the outer particle region (margin region) of the rubber powders in this manner.<br><br>
6<br>
These contents of the filler are therefore not absorbed externally on to the individual rubber particles (see DE-PS 37 23213), but are integrated into the rubber surface.<br>
This distribution of the filler and the nature of the bonding of the fillers in the rubber composition cause the high flowability of the powders according to the invention and prevent agglutination during storage of the powders, without these properties being lost due to mechanical stresses during conveying, silation etc.<br>
Further fillers which are optionally employed are the carbon blacks known from the rubber industry, preferably in finely divided form (fluffy), which in general have an average particle diameter of 1 to 9 ?m, preferably 1 to 8 ?m, without mechanical treatment, before they are suspended.<br>
This facilitates dispersion, so that aqueous suspensions with filler particles having an average particle diameter of significantly less than 10 ?m are obtained without a high expenditure of energy.<br>
Precipitated silica can advantageously be employed in the form of a filter-cake which has been washed free from salts.<br>
Possible metal salts are those which originate from elements of groups IIa, IIb, IIIa and VIII of the periodic table of the elements. This classification into groups corresponds to the old IUPAC recommendation (see Periodisches System der Elemente [Periodic Table of the Elements] , Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, 1985) . Typical<br><br>
7<br>
representatives are magnesium chloride, zinc sulfate, aluminium chloride, aluminium sulfate, iron chloride, iron sulfate, cobalt nitrate and nickel sulfate, the salts of aluminium being preferred. Aluminium sulfate and other Lewis acids are particularly preferred.<br>
The salts are employed in an amount of 0.1 to 6.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber. The metal salts prove to be particularly suitable for influencing the particle size of the precipitated products in the desired manner. Mineral acids, such as e. g. sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid, are optionally additionally used to establish the desired pH, sulfuric acid being particularly preferred. However, it is also possible to employ carboxylic acids, such as e. g. formic and acetic acid.<br>
The amount of acid depends on the nature and amount of the water-soluble metal salt, of the filler, of the organosilane employed, of the rubber and of the alkali metal silicate optionally present. It can easily be determined by a few orientating experiments.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, up to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of rubber, of silica (SiO2) in the form of an alkali metal silicate solution, preferably as water-glass with an Na2O: SiO2 molar ratio of 2 : 1 to 1 : 4, are also additionally employed. The alkali metal silicate solution can be added here both to the rubber component and to the filler suspension. Addition to the rubber component is preferred, especially in the continuous procedure.<br><br>
8<br>
The process according to the invention is in general carried out as follows:<br>
A filler suspension is first prepared by dispersing a portion, preferably &gt;50 %, of the filler contained in the end product, together with the metal salt, the organosilane compound and optionally the alkali metal silicate solution, in water, optionally in the presence of an emulsifier. The total amount of water employed depends on the nature of the filler and the degree of breakdown. In general, the water-insoluble constituents of the suspension are about 4 to 15 per cent by weight. This value is not a binding limitation, and the actual value can also be either below or above this. The maximum content is limited by the ability of the suspension to be pumped.<br>
The filler suspension thus prepared in then mixed intimately with the rubber latex, which optionally contains alkali metal silicate solution, or the aqueous emulsion, which optionally contains alkali metal silicate solution, of a rubber solution (first batch, first stage). Known stirrer units, such as e. g. propeller stirrers, are suitable for this.<br>
After the mixing, a pH in the range from 6.0 to 4.5 is first established with further stirring, preferably of a Lewis acid, in particular A12(SO4)3 with the aid of an acid [sic]. Rubber base particles with a constant filler and organosilane content are obtained here. The size of these base particles is controlled by the amount of metal salt chosen, in the range from 0.1 to 6.5 phr. The control takes place such that the largest particle size is obtained with the lowest amount of metal salt.<br><br>
9<br>
The remaining content of the filler suspension (second batch, splitting amount) is added with further lowering of the pH to 4.5 to 2.6, in particular approx. 3.2 (second stage), so that the rubber in the mixture precipitates out together with the filler modified by organosilicon compound(s).<br>
The solids content of the latices employed is in general 20 to 25 wt.%. The solids content of the rubber solutions is in general 3 to 35 wt.%, and that of the rubber emulsions is in general 5 to 3 0 wt.%.<br>
For working up of rubber powders with filler contents of &gt;100 phr it is advantageous to lower the pH to 2.5 before the phase separation. An acid from the abovementioned group of acids is expediently used for this.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out both discontinuously and continuously.<br>
The rubber powder which has precipitated out is advantageously separated off with the aid of a centrifuge and then dried to a residual water content of in general 
The rubber powders according to the invention are prepared using one or more organosilicon compounds of the general formula<br><br><br>
10 or<br>
R1,, (RO)3-n Si-(alkenyl)	(III)<br>
in which the symbols denote<br>
B:	-SCN, -SH, -Cl, -NH2 (if q = 1) or -Sx- (if q =<br>
2)<br>
R and R1 :   an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, branched or unbranched, the phenyl radical, where all the radical [sic] R and R1 in each case can have the same or a different meaning, preferably an alkyl group,<br>

n:	0; 1 or 2,<br>
Alk:       a divalent straight-chain or branched carbon [sic] radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
m:	0 or 1<br>
Ar:         an arylene radical having 6 to 12 C atoms<br>
p:	0 or 1, with the proviso that p and n do not<br>
simultaneously denote 0<br>
x:	a number from 2 to 8,<br>
alkyl:      a divalent straight-chain or branched<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 2 0 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms,<br><br>
11<br>
alkenyl:   a divalent straight-chain or branched<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
These compounds, if they are water-soluble, are in general employed in the form of solutions, or otherwise in the form of emulsions, it also being possible for the emulsions to be formed in the presence of the silica suspension.<br>
The emulsion or solution is preferably prepared at room<br>
temperature. However, temperatures of 10 to 60 Â° C are also<br>
suitable.<br>
The concentration of the organosilicon compound(s) in the<br>
suspension is 0.5 to 20 wt.%, preferably 5 to 12 wt.%,<br>
based on the total amount of filler employed.<br>
The pH of the emulsion or solution, like the pH of the<br>
filler suspension, after admixing of the emulsion is in the<br>
weakly acid or weakly alkaline range, but preferably at a<br>
pH of about 7.<br>
The term water-insoluble used is to be understood as follows:<br>
After mixing of the organosilane compound (without surface-active substance) with the suspension of the filler, no clear solution is formed around the filler particles in the desired pH and concentration range. Rather, the separate phases comprising water, solid and organosilicon compounds remain. The oligosulfidic organosilanes according to the general formula I given above are known per se and can be prepared by known processes. Examples of organosilanes which are preferably employed are the bis(trialkoxysilyl-alkyl) oligosulfides which can be prepared e.g. in<br><br>
12<br>
accordance with BE-PS 787 691, such as bis-(trimethoxy-, triethoxy-, -trimethoxy- ethoxy-, -tripropoxy-, -tributoxy-, -tri-i-propoxy- and -tri-i-butoxy-silyl-methyl) oligosulfides, and in particular the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexasulfides etc., furthermore bis-(2-tri-methoxy-, -triathoxy-, -trimethoxyethoxy-, -tripropoxy- and -tri-n-and -i-butoxy-ethyl) oligosulfides and in particular the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexasulfides etc., and furthermore the bis-(3-trimethoxy-, -triethoxy-, -trimethoxyethoxy-, -tripropoxy-, -tri-n-butoxy- and tri-i-butoxysilyl-propyl) oligosulfides and in particular in turn the di-, tri-,  tetrasulfides etc. up to octasulfides, and moreover the corresponding bis-(3-trialkoxysilylisobutyl) oligosulfides, the corresponding bis-(4-trialkoxysilylbutyl) oligosulfides. Of these selected organosilanes of the general formula I which are built up relatively simply, the bis-(3-trimethoxy-, -triethoxy- and tripropoxysilylpropyl) oligosulfides are in turn preferred, and in particular the di-, tri-, tetra- and pentasulfides, especially the triethoxy compounds with 2, 3 or 4 sulfur atoms, and mixtures thereof. Alk in the general formula I denotes a divalent, straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon radical, preferably a saturated alkylene radical with a straight carbon chain having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Compounds which are also specifically suitable are the silanes with the following structural formula<br><br>
13<br><br>
and methoxy analogues thereof, which can be prepared in accordance with DE-AS 25 58191. These compounds are not soluble in water.<br>
Surface-active substances which are used in this case are, preferably, nonionic, cationic and anionic surfactants. Their concentration in the emulsion is 1 to 15 wt.%, preferably 2 to 10 wt.%, based on the amount of organosilane compounds.<br>
Examples of such surfactants are alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, alkyl polyglycol ethers,polyglycols,<br>
alkyltrimethylammonium salts, dialkyldimtheylammonium [sic] salts, alkylbenzyltrimethylammomium salts, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl hydrogen sulfates, alkyl sulfates.<br>
The naturally occurring or precipitated fillers to be modified, also as a mixture of two or more of these fillers, are fillers which are known per se in rubber technology. An essential prerequisite for their suitability is the presence on the surface of the filler particles of OH groups which can react with the alkoxy groups of the organosilicon compounds. These are oxidic and silicatic fillers which are compatible with rubbers and which have the fine division necessary and known for this use.<br><br>
14<br>
Kaolins or clays are particularly suitable as naturally occurring silicates. However, kieselguhr or diatomaceous earth can also be employed<br>
Examples of oxidic fillers which may be mentioned are aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide or trihydrate and titanium dioxide.<br>
"Modified fillers" in this connection means that the organosilane compounds are bonded to the surface either by chemical reaction (OH groups) or adsorptively.<br>
The adsorptively bonded groups are converted into chemically bonded groups by the drying step.<br>
The emulsion is mixed with the filler suspension in amounts such that the concentration of the organosilicon compound is 0.5 to 20 wt.%, preferably 5 to 12 wt.%, based on the amount of filler.The modified fillers comprise 0.5 to 20 wt.%, preferably 0.5 to 12 wt.% of the organosilicon compounds, based on the dry filler.<br>
They are particularly suitable for use in rubber mixtures<br>
which can be vulcanized and shaped.<br>
A filter-cake from the silica precipitation which has been<br>
washed free from salts is advantageously employed for the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
Suspensions such as are obtained by working up naturally<br>
occurring fillers, such as clays, are also suitable.<br>
An energy-intensive drying step is thus saved, compared with the prior art.<br><br>
15 The silicas employed are known from the rubber sector.<br>
In general, they have an N2 surface area, determined by the known BET method, of 35 to 700 m2/g, a CTAB surface area of 30 to 500 m2/g, and a DBP number of 150 to 400 ml/l00g. The product according to the invention comprises these silicas in an amount of 5 to 250 parts, in particular 20 to 100 parts, based on 100 parts of rubber.<br>
If the fillers are white naturally occurring fillers, such as clays or siliceous chalks with an N2 surface area of 2 to 35 m2/g, these are employed in an amount of 5 to 350 parts, based on 100 parts of rubber.<br>
Filler-containing rubber powders which comprise silicas and carbon black as a mixture can also be prepared. However, the total amount of filler does not exceed 250 phr.<br>
Carbon blacks such as are generally employed in rubber processing are particularly suitable.<br>
These include furnace blacks, gas and flame blacks with an iodine adsorption number of 5 to 1000 m2/g, a CTAB number of 15 to 600 m2/g, a DBP adsorption of 30 to 400 ml/100 g and a 24 M4 DBP number of 50 to 3 70 ml/100 g, in an amount of 5 to 100 parts, in particular 20 to 100 parts per 100 parts of rubber.<br>
It has been found possible to employ as rubber types and prepare as aqueous emulsions the following species, individually or as a mixture with one another: Natural rubber, emulsion SBR with a styrene content of 10<br><br>
16<br>
to 50 %, butyl-acrylonitrile rubber.<br>
Butyl rubbers, terpolymers of ethylene, propylene (EPM) and non-conjugated dienes (EPDM), butadiene rubbers, SBR, prepared by the solution polymerization process, with styrene contents of 10 to 25 %, and contents of 1,2-vinyl constituents of 20 to 55 % and isoprene rubbers, in particular 3,4-polyisoprene.<br>
In the case of polymers prepared by solvent processes, particular safety measures should be taken because of the solvent content.<br>
In addition to the rubbers mentioned, the following elastomers are possible, individually or as a mixture: carboxyl rubbers, epoxide rubbers, trans-polypentenamer, halogenated butyl rubbers, rubbers of 2-chloro-butadiene, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, epichlorohydrins, optionally also chemically modified natural rubber, such as e. g. epoxidized types.<br>
In addition to the fillers already mentioned, the rubber powders according to the invention optionally comprise known processing or vulcanization auxiliary substances, such as zinc oxide, zinc stearate, stearic acid, polyalcohols, polyamines, plasticizers, antioxidants against heat, light or oxygen and ozone, reinforcing resins, flameproofing agents, such as e. g. Al(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2, pigments, various crosslinking chemicals and optionally sulfur, in the conventional concentrations of rubber technology.<br>
It is possible according to the invention to prepare a finely divided rubber powder which comprises silica<br><br>
17<br>
modified with organosilicon compounds, is free-flowing and also remains free-flowing after exposure to mechanical stresses (e. g. conveying, packing).<br>
Because of its finely divided nature, no grinding or other comminution measures are necessary to obtain finely divided dispersions.<br>
These then lead to the finely divided rubber powders which are easy to process, and to vulcanization products with improved properties.<br>
The ease of implementation and the advantages of the present invention are explained in the following examples, without the invention being limited to these measures demonstrated.<br><br>

Process for the preparation of finely divided rubbers (rubber powders) by precipitation from aqueous mixtures which comprises 50 to 350 parts based on 100 parts of rubber of a filler such as herein described in the form of suspensions, 0,1 to 8.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber of a water-soluble salts of a metal of groups IIa, IIb,IIIa and VIII of the periodic table of the elements and a rubber latex (polymer latex), aqueous emulsions of a rubber or rubber solution, characterized in that a) 0.5 to 20 wt % based on the total amount of filler of one or more organosilicon compound(s) such as herein described containing at least one alkoxy group is or are dissolved or emulsified, optionally in the presence of a surface-active substance such as herein described, in water, or the compounds mentioned are mixed directly, optionally with a surface-active substance, with an aqueous suspension of an oxidic or silicate finely divided filler or a mixture of these Fillers at a temperature of 10 to 60Â°C, preferably at room temperature, while stirring, the amount of this mixture envisaged for incorporation in the rubber, based on the filler content, in general being divided into two batches, and<br>
b)	a first batch is mixed with the polymer latex, the polymer emulsion or the polymer<br>
solution, the pH of this mixture is lowered to a pH of 6.0 to 4,5 with an acid, in particular a<br>
Lewis acid (first batch, first stage),<br>
c)	the remaining content (second batch, splitting amount) is added with further lowering of<br>
the pH to 4,5 to 2.6, in particular approx, 3.2 (second stage), so that the rubber in the<br>
mixture precipitates out together with the filler modified by organosilicon compound(s)<br>
d)	the solid which has precipitated out is separated off by measures known per se,<br>
e)	it is preferably washed, in order to adjust the pH to a value of approx 6 to 7 which is<br>
more compatible with the further processing, and<br>
f)	the filler-containing rubber is dried.<br></td>
