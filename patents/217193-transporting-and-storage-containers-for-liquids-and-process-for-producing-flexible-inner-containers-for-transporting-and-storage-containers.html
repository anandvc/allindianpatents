				<td>The invention relates to transporting and storage containers for liquids and process for producing flexible inner containers for transporting and storage containers.<br>
Transporting and storage containers of the generic type which are known from DE 197 22 194 C2 and have a blow-molded inner container made of plastic are used for storing and for transporting all types of liquids in the chemical, pharmaceutical, mineral-oil and foodstuff industries.<br>
The stringent legal environmental-protection regulations require transfer from disposable containers, such as pallet containers and drums or barrels, for transporting and for storing different types of liquids to reusable containers, a changeover to larger-volume containers with the aim of reducing the residual quantities, and the development of new reusable containers which, in terms of relieving the environment of harmful substances, can be reconditioned and of which the plastic constituent parts contaminated by the liquid transporting and storage contents can be disposed of in optimum fashion by a low-pollutant or even pollutant-free destruction operation, e.g. by incineration.<br>
The object of the invention is further to develop the transporting and storage container of the generic type in terms of a cost-effective reconditioning capacity by inexpensive production and optimum disposal of the plastic inner container.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the transporting and storage container for liquids having the features and production steps as described<br>
herein.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides transporting and storage containers for liquids, having a pallet-like substructure which is designed for handling by a stacker truck, storage and retrieval unit or similar transporting means, having a cubical or cubic inner container made of plastic with in each case a closable filling and outlet opening or a closable filling and removal opening, and having a metal grid casing which butts against the inner container and is made of cross-crossing horizontal and vertical grid bars made of metal, characterized in that the flexible inner container comprises an inner enclosure made of plastic sheet material and an outer enclosure made of a woven fabric material, the inner container is fastened on the top frame of the grid casing and/or on a protective covering (cover bars) of the transporting container, and the inner enclosure is positioned in the outer enclosure of the inner container.<br>
The transporting and storage container for liquids according to the invention and the process for producing the plastic inner container of the transporting container are distinguished by the following advantages:<br>
Designing the inner container as a flexible container, which comprises an inner enclosure made of plastic sheet material and an outer enclosure made of a woven fabric material, makes it possible, in relation to liquid containers having an inner container blow-moulded from plastic, to reduce the empty weight and the transportation costs on account of the low thickness of the sheeting and of the woven fabric material and to decrease to a considerable extent the amount of plastic material contaminated by paints, varnishes and similar environmentally harmful liquids, with the result that the disposal of said plastic material does not pose any problems. The transporting container can be reconditioned cost-effectively at the production and liquid-filling companies by straight-forwardly exchanging the inexpensive inner container, the small amount of space required for the flexible inner container, on account of the fact that it can be folded together, and the low production costs of the inner container making inexpensive storage possible. Finally, the production of the flexible inner container<br><br>
from a plastic sheet material and a woven fabric material preferably made of plastic is more cost-effective than the production of blow-moulded plastic inner containers using expensive blow-molding machines, which require high investment costs.<br>
The transporting and storage container according to the invention and the process for producing the flexible inner container of the transporting container are explained hereinbelow with reference to the schematic drawings, in which:<br>
