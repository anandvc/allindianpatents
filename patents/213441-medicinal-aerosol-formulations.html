The present invention relates to a pressure-liquefied propellant mixture based on hydrofluoro-aikanes, the use of this propellant mixture in aerosol formulations/ and a process for the preparation of the aerosol formulations.<br>
Many gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, can indeed be liquefied under pressure, but are not suitable as propellants for metered-dose aerosols, because the internal pressure in the container decreases very greatly as it becomes more empty. For this reason, only those propellants are used for medicinal metered-dose aerosols, which propellants can be liquefied at room temperature and in any case only lead to a slight decrease in the internal pressure in the container when the contents are successively removed by spraying. These include the short-chain alkar.es, such as propane, butane and isobutane, and the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as trichlorofluoromethane (Fll), dichlorodifiuoromethane (F12) and 1,2-dichloro-l, 1,2, 2-tetrafluoroethane (F114).<br>
WO-A-93/17665 in fact discloses a method for the administration of physiologically active compounds, in which a supercritical liquid solution is formed from a supercritical liquid solvent and the active compound and this is then converted into the subcritical range. The supercritical solvent used was carbon dioxide, it being  stated  that,  in  addition  to  carbon dioxide, dinitrogen   oxide,    chlorofluorocarbons   such   as dichlorodifluoromethane   and   trichlorofluoromethane, xenon, sulfur hexafluoride, ethanol, acetone, propane, water and mixtures thereof are suitable.<br>
In Research Disclosure (1978), 170, 58, XP-002090730, it was further mentioned that some fluorocarbon and chlorofluorocarbon propellants can be used in aerosol products such as hairsprays, deodorants<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
and antiperspirants as co-propellants together with<br>
carbon dioxide or dinitrogen monoxide. The<br>
2, 2-dichloro-l,1,1-trifluoroethane	(F123),<br>
1, 2-dichloro-l,1-difluoroethane (F132b), 2-chloro-1,1, 1-trifluoroethane (F133a), 1, 1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (F141b) and 1-chloro-l, 1-difluoroethane (F142b) mentioned as examples are chlorinated and, moreover, not very customary propellants. A hairspray in which trifluoromonochloroethane {F133a} together with carbon dioxide and/or dinitrogen monoxide is used as a propel1ant mixture is also disclosed in US-A-4 397 836.<br>
On account of the ozone problem caused by the elimination of free-radical chlorine atoms from CFCs, in the Montreal Agreement many countries came to an understanding that they would no longer use CFCs as propellants in future. Suitable CFC substitutes ror tne medicinal field are fluorinated alkanes (in the context<br>
of  the -pTesent  invention also _desi.gnated	as  HFA) ,<br>
especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2/3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227), as; these are inert and have a very low toxicity. On__account of<br>
their physical properties, such as pressure,	density,<br>
etc., they are particularly suitable for replacing CFCs such as Fll, F12 and F114 as propellants in metered-dose aerosols.<br>
US-A-4 139 607, on the other hand, proposed a propellant    system    formed    from    liquefied bis(difluoromethyl) ether and gaseous carbon dioxide, which in contrast to combinations of carbon dioxide with  other  known  propellants  such  as  trichloro-fluoromethane  or  methylene . chloride  should  afford satisfactory., aerosol samples,  but,  however,  has_not been accomplished. The document .,in_fact_mentions___yia__t other   propellants   such  as   dinitrogen  monoxide, hydrocarbons and fluorohydrocarbons or liquid carriers, such as ethanol, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, acetone, amyl acetate, water and the like, can be added<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
to the propellant system; the disclosed formulations/ however, mostly contain about 50% of ethanol. In Derwent Abstract AN 89-184245, it is only stated that in aerosol pressure packs for the administration of medicaments instead of CFCs, hydrocarbons, such as butane and pentane, other compressed gases, such as carbon dioxide, dimethyl ether, nitrogen and dinitrogen oxide, or fluorohydrocarbons could also be used.<br>
Medicinal   aerosol   preparations   containing hydrofluoroalkanes  such  as  HFA 134a  are  already embraced  by  the  teaching  of  US-A-2 868 691  and US-A-3 014 844  and  disclosed  in  DE-A-2 736 500  and EP-A-0 372 777.  Examples  of  formulations  containing HFA 227  are  found,  for  example,  in  WO-A-91/11495, EP-A-0 504 112 and EP-B-0 550 031.  It is known from various publications that the customary excipients used in  CFC-containing  metered-dose  aerosols,  such  as lecithin,  sorbitan  trioleate  and  oleic  acid,  only dissolve  inadequately  in hydrofluoroalkanes  such  as HFA 134a and HFA 227, because a chain extension and the substitution of the chlorine atoms by fluorine atoms leads to a worsening of the solubility properties of the permitted excipients mentioned. Even in the case of CFCs, which are considerably better solvents than HFAs, ethanol or other cosolvents were often added to improve the  solubility  in order  to be  able  to  administer pharmaceutical  substances  such  as  isoprenaline  and epinephrine (cf. US-A-2 8 68 691) as an aerosol. It was therefore obvious to improve not only the solubility of CFCs, but also that of HFAs, by addition of ethanol. Examples of this are found in the technical literature and in various patent applications. Alternatively to this, there are a number of developments of pressure-liquefied  aerosol  preparations  containing  HFA 134a and/or HFA 227 which use propellant-soluble excipients, such   as   fluorinated   surface-active   substances (WO-A-91/04011),  mono-  or  diacetylated  glycerides (EP-A-0 504 112)    or    polyethoxylated    compounds<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
(WO-A-92/000 61) , which can be dissolved in the necessary amount in the two propellants even without addition of ethanol.<br>
For CFC-free medicinal aerosol preparations having a high vapor pressure, the propellant__preferabley used today is usually HFA 134a (vapor pressure about 6 bar at 20°C) and for those with a lower vapor pressure it is HFA 227 (vapor pressure about 4.2 bar at 20°C) . Both propellants differ with respect to their density (about 1.4 mg/ml for HFA 227 and about 1.2 mg/ml for HFA 134a at 20°C), which is particularly, of importance for suspensions. If the active compound has a higher density than the propellant, sedimentation occurs; if its density is lower, flotation 'occurs. To solve the problem, it is therefore suggested under certain circumstances to use propellant mixtures and/or, to lower the density, to add cosolvents. such as., ethanol, diethyl ether or other low-boiling solvents or propellants such as n-butane. A significant, disadvantage of the hydrofluoroalkanes is their relatively low dissolv.ing ,ppwe_r in.,, comparison with CFCS/ in particular in comparison with Fll. The solvent properties decrease with increasing__ch.a±n Lena-th jja__the sequence Fll &gt; HFA 134a &gt; HFA 227. For this reason, the suspending aTds" customarily used in CFCs, such as sorbitan trioleate, lecithin and oleic acid, can no longer be. dissolved in the customary concentrations (weight ratios of typically approximately 1:2 to 1:20, based on the active compound) by addition of polar solvents without increasing the hydrophilicity.<br>
It is generally known that in the case of suspension formulations only active compound particles which are smaller than 6 um are respirable. For the desired deposition thereof in the lungs, these must therefore be comminuted or micronized before processing by means of special procedures, such as using pinned-disk, ball or air-jet mills. A grinding process as a rule leads to an increase in surface area, which is<br><br>
- 5-<br>
accompanied by an increase in the electrostatic charge of the micronized active compound, on account of which the flow behaviour and the active compound dispersion is usually impaired. As a result of the interfacial and charge activities, there is often an agglomeration of active compound particles or alternatively adsorption of active compound at interfaces, which becomes conspicuous, for example, in the accumulation on equipment or container surfaces.<br>
In aerosol preparations in which the active compound is present suspended in liquefied propellant, adsorption or ring formation in the container can occur at the place where the liquid phase changes into the gas phase. Without wetting the micronized active compound particles or conducting away charges and modifying their surface properties, problems can occur during dispersion or suspension, in the hydrofluoroalkanes mentioned. The lack of wetting or dispersion of the active compound particles also results in these in many cases having a high adsorption tendency and adhering to surfaces, such as the container inner wall or the valve, which then leads to an underdo sage and to a poor dosage accuracy from puff of spray to puff of spray. In the case of suspensions, it is therefore necessary as a rule to add a surface-active substance or a glidant in order to lower the adsorption at interfaces, to stabilize the suspensions and to ensure the dosage accuracy. A change or reduction in the proportion of . the inhalable, respirable particles, the so-called fine particle fraction (FPF) or fine particle dose (FPD), occurring in the course of storage, which leads to a decrease in the activity of the HFA preparation, is particularly problematical.<br>
To overcome the problems presented above, as a rule surface-active substances are therefore added, as were already used earlier in the CFC-containing formulations. Alternatively to this, in certain cases a<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
modification of the surface properties by means of various measures (e.g. coating) may help to minimize these undesired effects. Because, however, surface-active agents such as oleic acid, sorbitan trioleate and lecithin only dissolve inadequately in hydro fluoroalkanes such as HFA 134 a and HFA 22 7, in many cases ethanol is or must be added as a cosolvent so that the pharmaceutical technology problems can be controlled better.<br>
If, however, ethanol is added in a higher concentration, the density of the propellant mixture is reduced, which can lead to an undesired sedimentation of active compound, especially in the case of suspensions. Moreover, a "wet spray" can undesirably be obtained, because the propellant evaporates much more rapidly than ethanol. In addition, however, as a result of the increase in solubility during storage, the active compounds can also start to dissolve, which then, leads to crystal growth  and thus, in turn, to a reduction in the amount of inhalable, respirablel particles, the so-called fine particle dose (FPD) .<br>
To measure the aerodynamic particle size distribution or the proportion of the dose which can be deposited in the lungs, the so-called fine particle dose (FPD), of inhalable, respirable particles in an aerosol, impactors, such as the 5-stage multistage liquid impinger (MSLI) or the 8-stage Andersen cascade impactor (ACI), which are described in Chapter  of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or in the Inhalants Monograph of the European Pharmacopeia {Ph. Eur.) are suitable. Using these apparatuses, the aerodynamic deposition behaviour of the aerosol cloud can be investigated in the laboratory (in vitro) . By means of a "log-probability plot" (logarithmic representation of the probability distribution) , the mean aerodynamic particle diameter (Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD)) of aerosol preparations can then be calculated. From this, it can be deduced<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
whether  the  active  compound  is  more  likely  to  be deposited in the upper or lower area of the lungs.<br>
If the active compound is. present in the HFA propellant/ethanol mixture not in suspended form, but in dissolved form, problems with respect to the standard deviation of the dosage accuracy per stroke are usually less pronounced. If, however, a larger amount of ethanol is used for this, on rinsing empty the container a "head space7' effect occurs as follows: the proportion of ethanol, which has a lower vapor pressure and a lower density, increases and that of propellant having higher density and higher vapor pressure decreases. On spraying or. as the container becomes more empty, the concentration ratio of propellant to ethanol changes, which on account of the density difference leads to a reduction in the mass of a puff of spray and thus also in the content of a puff of spray or active compound. It is additionally disadvantageous that at higher ethanol concentrations of, for example, 10%-30%, the content of inhalable particles (
In a solution aerosol with the same ethanol content, a higher fine particle fraction (FPF), i.e. a greater percentage of inhalable droplets, is customarily obtained with HFA 134a in comparison to HFA 227, which is to be attributed to the higher pressure of HFA 134a. In principle, it is true that the higher the internal pressure in the aerosol container, the finer the particle spectrum of the aerosol cloud. Solution aerosols having a low ethanol content therefore as a rule have a smaller MMAD (0.8-1.5 m) than suspension aerosols (2-4  m) , when using fine atomizing nozzles. This is connected with the fact that<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
droplets are generated as an aerosol cloud in the case of solution aerosols and particles in the case of suspension aerosols.<br>
For the topical application of active compounds in the area of the bronchi and bronchioles, particle sizes of about 2-4 urn are advantageous, as are customarily achieved with suspension formulations. Smaller particles which pass into the alveolar area are partly exhaled (
In the case of ethanol-containing solution aerosols, unfortunately there are frequently problems concerning the active compound stability. Active compounds, such as fenoterol and salbutamol are affected by this, which is why such active compounds have preferably been formulated as suspensions until now. To reduce their solubility in the propel1ant mixture, the polar salts such as fenoterol hydrobromide are also frequently employed.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of making available a propellant system with which:<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
-	active compounds can be better wetted;<br>
-	suspension aerosols having improved suspension and<br>
shelf-life properties can be prepared;<br>
-	solution aerosols having improved storage stability<br>
and lower addition of ethanol can be prepared;<br>
-	the dosage accuracy can be improved;<br>
-	the particle size distribution spectrum and the MMAD<br>
can be better adjusted; and/or<br>
-	the fine particle dose (FPD) can be increased and the<br>
oropharyngeal deposition can be reduced.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a pressure-liquefied propellant mixture for aerosols, comprising dinitrogen monoxide and a hydrofluoroalkane of the general formula<br>
CxHyFz	(I)<br>
in which x is the number 1, 2 or 3, y and z are each an integer &gt; 1 and y + z = 2x + 2.<br>
, Surprisingly, it was in fact found that the targets mentioned are achieved and propellant mixtures having more advantageous properties can be obtained if a small amount of dinitrogen monoxide (laughing gas) is added to propellants based on hydrofluoroalkanes. If desired, a small amount of carbon dioxide, which brings about similar improvements, can additionally be added to the propellant. Gas mixtures of this type - in contrast to dinitrogen oxide or carbon dioxide as the sole propellant - show only a slight decrease in the internal pressure in the container as it becomes more empty, which makes possible their use as propellants for metered-dose aerosols. As is illustrated in Table 1 with the aid of some examples, propellant mixtures of this type can be employed in a wide temperature range for metered-dose aerosols. This effect is also observed if the propellant mixture or the aerosol formulation additionally contains a cosolvent such as ethanol."<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
Table 1<br>

as cosolvent<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has further been found that by the addition of dinitrogen oxide and, if desired, carbon dioxide to hydrofluoroalkanes such as HFA 134a and/or HFA 227 the suspension of pharmaceutical active compounds is facilitated and the tendency to adhesion and adsorption of active compounds on interfaces is decreased. Using propellant mixtures of this type, suspensions which are distinguished by controlled flocculation.can therefore be prepared more easily, and as a result of the better suspension properties, in many cases the addition of - in some cases undesired -surface-active suspension aids and/or cosolvents can be dispensed with or at least their proportion can be decreased. By addition of glidants such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol, suspension or solution aerosols having improved properties can often be obtained.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
In addition, it has been found that the undesired deposition of active compound in the oropharynx can be reduced and at the same time the FPD can be increased.<br>
With  the  aid  of  dinitrogen  oxide ' and,  if desired,  carbon  dioxide,  it  is  also  possible  to displace  oxygen  from  the  hydrofluoroalkanes,  as  a result of which the storage stability of oxidation-sensitive active compounds is improved. Moreover,  by addition of dinitrogen oxide and,  if desired,  carbon dioxide, the internal pressure in the aerosol container can  be . adjusted  such  that  in  comparison  to  a conventional CFC or HFA metered-dose aerosol the FPF and MMAD can be virtually aligned as appears most sensible for the respective application.  It is thus possible to produce MDIs  (Metered-dose Inhalers)  for both topical application and systemic administration. In particular for systemic administration, completely new  possibilities  of  use  are  opened  up,  because virtually monodisperse aerosols having high respirable fractions can be produced in combination with suitable atomizing nozzles.<br>
The propellant mixture according to the invention thus also offers advantages in the case of suspension and solution aerosol formulations, in which a surface-active agent and/or a cosolvent is necessary or desired. On the one hand, the use of propellants which contain dinitrogen oxide and, if desired, carbon dioxide frequently permits a reduction in the amount of cosolvent needed and a better solubility of conventional surface-active agents. On the other hand, the disadvantageous influence of cosolvents such as ethanol on the droplet size can be avoided completely or to the greatest possible extent, since as a result of a corresponding increase in the concentration of dinitrogen oxide and, if desired, carbon dioxide even at comparatively high cosolvent concentrations, the internal pressure and the deposition behaviour can be<br><br>
- 12. -<br>
adjusted such that both the fine particle dose and the MMAD can be adjusted in a therapy-compliant manner.<br>
The preparation of the propellant mixtures according to the invention can be carried out in a manner known per se by introducing dinitrogen monoxide and, if desired, carbon dioxide, under pressure into a hydrofluoroalkane of the formula I.<br>
The propellant mixture according to the invention is suitable in principle for any desired aerosol applications such as cosmetic and household sprays. On account of the advantages described - such as the small fall in the internal pressure on emptying, lower temperature dependence and easier adjustability of the internal pressure, improved wetting properties for pharmaceutical active compounds and usability of conventional surface-active agents such as oleic acid, lecithin and sorbitan trioleate - the propellant mixture according to the invention, however, is especially also suitable for medicinal aerosol formulations and in particular for inhalation aerosols.<br>
The invention therefore likewise relates to a medicinal aerosol formulation, comprising an efficacious amount of a pharmaceutically active compound, and a pressure-liquefied propellant mixture, containing dinitrogen monoxide and a hydrofluoroalkane of the general formula<br>
CxHyFz	(I)<br>
in which x is the number 1, 2 or 3, y and z are each an integer &gt; 1 and y + z = 2x + 2.<br>
Examples of suitable hydrofluoroalkanes which can be used in the propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations according to the invention are: difluoromethane (HFA 32), pentafluoroethane (HFA 125) , 1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134), 1,1,1,2-tetra-fluoroethane  {HFA 134a),  1,1,2-trifluoroethane  (HFA<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
143),  1, 1/ 1-trifluoroethane  (HFA 143a),  1,1-difluoro-ethane   (HFA 152a),   1,1,1,2,3, 3, 3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227),  hexafluoropropane  (HFA 236),  pentafluoro-piropane   {HFA 245)   and   the   like.   In   general, hydrofluoroalkanes  having  2  or  3  hydrocarbons  are preferred.  Particularly preferred propellant mixtures and  aerosol  formulations  are  those  which  contain 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane   (HFA 134a),   1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227) or a mixture of the two, for example a 1:1 mixture.<br>
The propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations according to the invention preferably contain at least approximately 0.0001% bv weiaht, in particular at least approximately 0.01% by weight, of dinitroqen monoxide. If desired, the propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations can additionally contain a small amount of carbon dioxide. The content of dinitrogen monoxide and carbon dioxide is dependent, inter alia, on the pressure desired, the nature of. the hydrofluoroalkanes used and the nature and amount of possible further propellants and cosolvents and the like. In general, however, the content of dinitrogen monoxide or the content of dinitrogen monoxide and carbon dioxide together is approximately 0.0001 to 10% by weight, preferably approximately 0.01 to 6% by weight and particularly preferably approximately 0.1 to 3% by weight. In the case of medicinal aerosols and in particular in inhalation aerosols, in general a content of dinitrogen monoxide or of dinitrogen monoxide and carbon dioxide together of approximately 0.01 to 2% by weight, typically approximately 0.1 to 1.0% by weight; is preferred; as a rule higher concentrations are only indicated if the formulation contains a comparatively high content of cosolvents such as ethanol or water.<br>

The active compounds mentioned can optionally be used in the form of their isomers, enantiomers or racemates and, in the case of acids or bases, as such or in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives. The optimum amount of active compound in the formulations according to the invention depends on the particular active compound. As a rule, however, aerosol formulations are preferred which contain at least approximately 0.0001 and at most approximately 5% by weight, in particular approximately 0.01 to 3% by weight, of active compound.<br>
Examples of active compounds which can be preferably used are the antiasthmatics such as beta-mimetics, corticosteroids and anticholinergics and antiallergics such as mast cell inhibitors. Aerosol formulations which contain salbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, fluticasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, cromoglycic acid, nedocromil, mometasone, sildenafil, beclomethasone, levalbuterol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative of these active compounds are particularly preferred.<br>
Depending on the nature of the active compounds and further additives, the aerosol formulations according to the invention can be present in the form<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
of suspensions/ emulsions or solutions. The aerosol formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se by introducing dinitroaen monoxide .under ares_s_u_re into a liquefied hydrofluoroalkane of the formula I and adding the pharmaceuticaily active compound. The dinitrogeri monoxide and the active compound can basically be added in any desired sequence. In the case of suspension formulations, however, as a rule it is preferred firstly to introduce the dinitrogen monoxide into the propellant and then to add the micronized active compound. The micronization of the active compound can take place in a known manner and is preferably carried out such that a particle size of approximately 0.5 to 6 jam is obtained. If carbon dioxide is additionally added to the aerosol formulation, this can be introduced under pressure to the liquefied hydrofluoroalkane either separately or together with the dinitrogen monoxide.<br>
The prcpellant mixtures . and aerosol formulations according to the invention can contain drfe or more hvdrofluoroalkanes and, if desired, further propellants. Preferably, however, they contain no chlorofluorocarbons. Particularly preferred propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations are in general those which - apart from compounds such as water, lower alkanes, lower alcohols and lower ethers which can be used, if desired, as cosol vents - contain as propellants only dinitrogen monoxide and one or more hydrofluoroalkanes of the formula I and, if desired carbon dioxide. The hydrofluoroalkane or the hydrofluoroalkanes and the carbon dioxide concentration are preferably selected such that an internal pressure of approximately 3 to 10 bar, particularly preferably approximately 3.5 to 6 bar, can be established at 20°C in the aerosol container.<br>
The aerosol formulations according to the invention are suitable for suspension, emulsion and solution formulations, and they can contain customary<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
additives such as cosolvents, glidants or lubricants (e.g. glycerol) and surface-active agents. The addition of the active compound and possible further additives can be carried out in a manner known per se. As a result of the improvement of the fine particle fraction achievable according to the invention and the simultaneous reduction in the undesired oropharyngeal deposition, it is frequently possible to decrease the active compound concentration significantly in comparison to a CFC-containing metered-dose aerosol.<br>
The use of a cosolvent is frequently indicated, in particular in solution formulations, but can occasionally also be advantageous in suspension formulations.<br>
Suitable cosolvents are in particular water, lower alcohols, lower alkanes and lower ethers, preferably water, alcohols having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, alkanes having 3 to 6 carbon atoms and dialkyl ethers having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as water, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether and the like. Diethyl ether and in particular ethanol are particularly preferred. The proportion of cosolvent in the propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations according to the invention, if present, can in general..be approximately 0.01 to 40% by weight, in particular approximately 0.1 to 15%' by 'weight, based on the total mixture or the total formulation.<br>
The proportion of one or more hydrofluoroalkanes of the formula I in the propellant mixtures and aerosol formulations according to the invention is in general at least approximately 40% by weight, preferably at least approximately 64% by weight and particularly preferably at least approximately 87% by weight, of the total mixture or of the total formulation. In the case of the medicinal aerosol formulations,     however,     the     proportion     of<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
hydrofluoroalkanes with respect to the content of active compound, surface-active agent and possible further additives can also be lower and can be, for example, at least approximately 30% by weight.<br>
The use of a surface-active agent is frequently indicated,  in particular in the case of suspension formulations, but can also be advantageous in solution formulations/ e.g. for valve lubrication. In principle all customary surface-active agents are suitable, such as   oleic   acid,   lecithin,   sorbitan   trioleate, cetylpyridinium   chloride,   benzalkonium   chloride, polyoxyethylene      (20)     sorbitan     monolaurate, polyoxyethylene (10) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (2) oleyl    ether,    polyoxyethylene    (20)    sorbitan monostearate, polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate, polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene   block   copolymers, polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene/ethylenediamine  block copolymers,  ethoxylated castor oil and the like.  In general,  oleic 'acid,  scrbitan trioleate and lecithin are preferred. The proportion of surface-active agent, if present, can preferably be approximately 0.0001 to 1% by weight, in particular approximately 0.001 to 0.1% by weight, based on the total formulation. Preferably, however,  the  aerosol  formulations  according  to  the invention can also be  essentially  free of  surface-active agents,  i.e. can contain less than 0.0001% by weight of surface-active agents.<br>
Furthermore, the aerosol formulations according to the invention can contain, if desired, buffer substances or stabilizers such as citric acid, ascorbic acid, sodium EDTA, vitamin E, N-acetylcysteine and the like. In general, such substances, if present, are used in amounts of not more than approximately 1% by weight, for example approximately 0.0001 to 1% by weight, based on the total'formulation.<br>
The aerosol formulations according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se using stirrers  and homogenizers.  For filling,  known<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
processes, such as the cold- or pressure-filling technique or modifications of these techniques, can be employed. Suitable containers are, for example, pressure-resistant containers made of glass, plastic or aluminum, which can be equipped with metered-dose valves of, for example 10 to 140 \xl and can be provided with commercially available - also inspiration-triggered - mouth tube adapters.<br>
In the preparation of aerosol formulations, the propellant mixtures according to the invention thus offer a number of advantages, such as better wetting of active compound, improved suspension and shelf-life properties of suspension formulations, improvement in the dosage accuracy, increase in the fine particle dose and, if desired, a decrease in the amounts of cosolvent or the wide avoidance of the disadvantages of high amounts of cosolvent.<br>
The invention therefore likewise relates to the use of the propellant mixtures according to' the invention as propellants for aerosols, the use for medicinal aerosols and in particular for nasal or inhalant aerosols (which can preferably have an aerodynamic particle or droplet diameter of approximately 0.5 to 40 um, in particular approximately 0.5 to 6 urn) being preferred, and the use in a pressure-resistant container having a metered-dose valve and a suitable adapter for the atomization or inhalation of pharmaceutical active compounds.<br>
Using the propellant system according to the invention,  it is possible to prepare,  for example, a budesonide metered-dose aerosol which, in comparison to a CFC-containing commercial product (Pulmicort®, Astra, Sweden)  has a far better dosage accuracy and an FPF which is almost twice as high. Supplementary to this, the  deposition  in the  mouth  tube  is  approximately halved  and  that  in  the  "sample  induction  port" {artificial oropharynx)  is reduced from about 50% to 20%. The formulation according, to the invention thus<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
makes, it possible to formulate the metered-dose aerosol more advantageously with respect to a number of aspects, as the respirable dose can be virtually doubled and the undesired oropharyngeal in-vitro deposition in the sample induction port can be reduced, as can be shown by the example of beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide and disodium cromoglycate. It is therefore to be expected that in the case of budesonide the same therapeutic effect as, for example, with the commercial product Pulmicort® is presumably achieved using half the dosage.<br>
The invention is illustrated further by the following examples. The homogenization of active compound suspensions was in each case carried out using a rotor-stator homogenizer (Kinematika).<br>

claim 24,   wherein said propellant mixture is useful as a<br>
propellant for medicinal aerosols, in particular for nasal<br>
and inhalant aerosols.<br>
26.	A pressure liquified propellant mixture, as claimed in<br>
any one of claims 1-9,  wherein said mixture is useful as a<br>
propellant  in  a  pressure  resistant  container  having  a<br>
metered  dose  valve  and  a  suitable  adapter  for  the<br>
atomization   or   inhalation   of   pharmaceutical   active<br>
compounds.<br>
A pressure-liquefied propellant mixture for aerosols, comprising dinitrogen monoxide and a hydrofluoroalkane having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, in particular 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and/or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, makes possible an improvement in the wetting properties of pharmaceutically active compounds, whereby the formulation problems existing with hydrofluoroalkanes can be overcome with respect to suspension and solution aerosols and thus improved medicinal aerosol formulations can be obtained. With the aid of dinitrogen monoxide, it is also possible to influence the pressure and thus the particle size distribution specifically and, by displacement of oxygen from the hydrofluoroalkanes, to improve the storage stability of oxidation-sensitive active compounds. If desired, the propellant mixture can additionally contain carbon dioxide.</td>
