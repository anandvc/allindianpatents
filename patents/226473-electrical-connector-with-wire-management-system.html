				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to the art of electrical connectors and,<br>
particularly, to a connector having a wire management means for facilitating<br>
terminating the conductors of a plurality of electrical wires to the terminating portions<br>
of the connector terminals.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A known type of input/output (I/O) electrical connector includes an elongated<br>
dielectric housing having a front mating face and a rear face with a plurality of<br>
terminal-receiving passages extending therebetween. The faces extend longitudinally<br>
between opposite ends of the elongated housing. A plurality of terminals are received<br>
in the passages. Each terminal includes a forwardly projecting contact portion and a<br>
tail portion projecting rearwardly from the housing beyond the rear face thereof. The<br>
tail portions typically are inserted into holes in a printed circuit board, surface<br>
mounted to circuit traces on a circuit board or connected directly to the center<br>
conductors of discrete electrical wires.<br>
With the ever-increasing miniaturization of the electronics in various<br>
industries, such as in the computer and telecommunications industries, along with the<br>
accompanying miniaturization of electrical connectors, considerable problems have<br>
been encountered in terminating miniature terminals, particularly the terminal tails.<br>
This is particularly true when the tail portions of the terminals are terminated to<br>
"loose" or freely movable electrical wires (versus more stationary circuit traces of a<br>
generally rigid circuit board). This problem of terminating the tiny terminal tails to<br>
the conductors of discrete electrical wires is magnified or compounded when the<br>
terminals are mounted in the connector housing in a plurality of closely spaced rows<br>
which is typical in many known I/O electrical connectors. The present invention is<br><br>
directed to solving these problems by providing a unique wire management system in<br>
such an electrical connector.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide a new and improved<br>
electrical connector of the character described, including a wire management means<br>
for facilitating termination of the tail portions of a plurality of terminals to the<br>
conductors of a plurality of electrical wires, particularly when the terminals are<br>
mounted in rows in the connector housing.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the connector includes an<br>
elongated dielectric housing having a central body portion with a front face, a rear<br>
face and three rows of terminal-receiving passages extending therebetween and<br>
including a top row, a middle row and a bottom row. A plurality of terminals are<br>
received in the passages and include top terminals received in at least some of the<br>
passages of the top row, middle terminals received in at least some of the passages of<br>
the middle row and bottom terminals received in at least some of the passages of the<br>
bottom row. All of the terminals have forward contact portions and tail portions<br>
projecting rearwardly from the body portion beyond the rear face thereof. The tail<br>
portions of the middle terminals are longer than the tail portions of the top terminals.<br>
The invention contemplates a wire management platform projecting from the<br>
rear face of the central body portion. The platform includes a first top surface at<br>
which the tail portions of the top terminals are juxtaposed. A second top surface is<br>
offset from the first top surface and projects further from the rear face of the body<br>
portion than the first top surface and at which the longer tail portions of the middle<br>
terminals are juxtaposed. A bottom surface is provided at which the tail portions of<br>
the bottom terminals are juxtaposed. The three distinct surfaces facilitate connection<br>
of the tail portions of the terminals to the conductors of a plurality of appropriate<br>
electrical wires.<br>
As disclosed herein, a plurality of grooves are provided in at least one of the<br>
platform surfaces, aligned with the tail portions juxtaposed thereat. The grooves<br><br>
facilitate aligning the electrical wires and respective conductors with the tail<br>
portions of the terminals.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a wire management platform may<br>
include a first top surface and an offset, longer second top surface for use in a<br>
connector having only two rows of terminals, with the tail portions of the bottom<br>
row being longer than then the tail portions of the top row. According to a<br>
further aspect of the invention, a wire management platform for a single row of<br>
terminals may include grooves for aligning the conductors of the wires with the<br>
tail portions of the terminals.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from<br>
the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring to the drawings in greater detail, and first to Figures 1 -5, the<br>
invention is embodied in an electrical connector, generally designated 14, which<br>
includes an inner dielectric housing (described hereinafter) substantially surrounded<br>
by a front shield, generally designated 16, and a back shield, generally designated 17.<br>
Each of the shields 16 and 17 is a one-piece structure stamped and formed of<br>
conductive sheet metal material.<br>
The connector is an input/output (I/O) electrical device wherein front shield 16<br>
defines a front mating face 18 of the connector, and rear shield 17 defines a rear<br>
terminating face 20. The front face actually is formed by a shroud portion 22 of<br>
shield 16 surrounding forwardly projecting contact portions of three rows of data<br>
transmission terminals. The top row of terminals are generally designated 24A; the<br>
middle row of terminals are generally designated 24B; and the bottom row of<br>
terminals are generally designated 24C. The data transmission terminals project<br>
through terminal-receiving passages 26 (Fig. 2) in the connector housing. It should be<br>
noted in Figures 1 and 2 that terminals are not inserted into all of the passages in the<br>
all of the rows. The terminal configuration or array is determined by the particular<br>
specifications or application of the connector.<br>
A conductive ground blade 28 projects through a blade-receiving passage 30<br>
(Fig. 2) in the connector housing. A pair of high speed signal terminals 32 (Figs. 1<br>
and 3) project through a pair of terminal-receiving passages 34 (Fig. 2) in the housing<br>
on each opposite side of ground blade 28. Terminating tail portions 34c (Fig. 4) of<br>
the high speed signal terminals 32 project rearwardly of rear shield 17. The top row<br>
of terminals 24A have tail portions 36A projecting rearwardly of the shield. The<br>
middle of terminals 24B have tail portions 36B (Figs. 4 and 5) projecting rearwardly<br>
of the rear shield. The bottom row of terminals 24C have tail portions 36C (Fig. 5)<br>
projecting rearwardly of the rear shield. All of the tail portions of all of the terminals<br>
project rearwardly of rear shield 17 on a rear wire management platform 40 of the<br>
connector housing.<br><br>
At this point, it should be understood that the use of the terms "top", "bottom"<br>
and "middle" herein and in the claims hereof is not in any way intended to be limiting.<br>
These terms are used herein to provide a clear and concise understanding of the<br>
invention. Electrical connector 14 is omnidirectional in use and such terms are used<br>
basically in reference to the depiction or orientation in the drawings to best understand<br>
the invention.<br>
Front shield 16 has a pair of rearwardly formed tabs 42 on both the top and<br>
bottom thereof to embrace the housing as will be seen hereinafter. Four rearwardly<br>
formed tabs 44 are bent from a base plate 46 of front shield 16 over a base plate 48 of<br>
rear shield 17 to secure the front and rear shields about the connector housing.<br>
Referring to Figures 6 and 7, connector 14 includes a two-part dielectric<br>
housing, generally designated 60, which is formed of a front housing or housing part,<br>
generally designated 62, and a rear housing or housing part, generally designated 64.<br>
The front housing part defines a front mating end 66 of the housing, and the rear<br>
housing part defines a rear end 68 of the housing. The front housing part includes a<br>
central body portion 69 which includes terminal-receiving passages 26 for data<br>
transmission terminals 24A-24C, terminal-receiving passages 34 for high speed signal<br>
terminals 32 and blade-receiving passage 30 for receiving ground blade 28. Tail<br>
portions 36A-36C of the data transmission terminals and tail portions 32c of the<br>
signal terminals project rearwardly of front housing part 62. The rear end of ground<br>
blade 28 also projects rearwardly of the front housing part. The front housing part has<br>
end recesses 70 and top and bottom recesses 72, along with upwardly and<br>
downwardly projecting tabs 74, for purposes described hereinafter.<br>
Rear housing part 64 includes a central body portion 76 for abutting against<br>
the rear of front housing part 62 when the housing parts are assembled in the direction<br>
of arrows "A" (Fig. 6). The rear housing part has side wings 78 and top and bottom<br>
wings 80 which move into recesses 70 and 72, respectively, of the front housing part<br>
when the two housing parts are assembled as shown in Figure 7. Rear housing part 64<br>
also has upwardly and downwardly projecting tabs 82 which become juxtaposed with<br>
tabs 74 of the front housing part when assembled.<br><br>
After data transmission terminals 24A-24C, high speed signal terminals 32<br>
and ground blade 28 are mounted in front housing part 62, and rear housing part 64 is<br>
juxtaposed against the front housing part, the front and rear shields of the connector<br>
are assembled to complete the assembly of the connector as shown in Figures 8 and 9.<br>
More particularly, as seen in Figure 8, the subassembly of the two-part housing 60,<br>
the data transmission terminals, the high speed signal terminals and the ground blade<br>
are assembled to front shield 16. A forwardly projecting portion 84 of the front<br>
housing part is properly positioned within shroud 22 of the front shield. Tabs 42 at<br>
the top and bottom of base plate 46 of the front shield then are bent into recesses 86 in<br>
the top and bottom of rear housing part 64, about tabs 74 and 82 (Figs. 6 and 7) of the<br>
front and rear housing parts, respectively. Therefore, tabs 42 of the front shield are<br>
effective to not only hold the front shield to housing 60, but to hold the two housing<br>
parts 62 and 64 together.<br>
Rear shield 17 then is assembled as shown in Figure 9. The rear shield has a<br>
shroud 88 which substantially surrounds the two-part housing, except for rearwardly<br>
extending wire management platform 40 of the rear housing. Shroud 88 has apertures<br>
90 for accommodating rearwardly formed tabs 42 of the front shield. In final<br>
assembly, tabs 44 of the front shield are bent or formed around the back side of base<br>
plate 48 of the rear shield to hold the two shields together and the connector in fully<br>
assembled condition.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 best show that ground blade 28 has a pair of positioning arms<br>
28a which project from each opposite side of the ground blade at a rear terminating<br>
end thereof. The rear housing has partitions 92 which project between each pair of<br>
positioning arms to form four quadrants for receiving four coaxial cables for<br>
termination to tail portions 32a of high speed signal terminals 32.<br>
Referring to Figures 10-12 which show rear housing part 64 and Figures 8 and<br>
9 which show the assembled connector, the invention contemplates a particular<br>
configuration of wire management platform 40 to facilitate connection of tail portions<br>
36A-36C of terminals 24A-24C to the conductors of a plurality of discrete electrical<br>
wires. More particularly, the wire management platform projects rearwardly from<br><br>
rear face 68 of rear housing part 64. The platform includes a first top land or surface<br>
94A at which tail portions 36 A of the top row of terminals are juxtaposed as clearly<br>
shown in Figures 8 and 9. The platform includes a second top land or surface 94B<br>
offset from the first top surface and projecting further from rear face 68 than first top<br>
surface 94A, and at which tail portions 36B of the middle row of terminals are<br>
juxtaposed. As seen in Figures 8 and 9, as well as in Figure 4, the tail portions of the<br>
middle row of terminals are longer than the tail portions of the top row of terminals.<br>
Finally, the platform includes a bottom land or surface 94C at which tail portions 36C<br>
of the bottom row of terminals are juxtaposed.<br>
In order to further facilitate managing and terminating the tail portions of the<br>
terminals to the conductors of a plurality of discrete electrical wires, grooves 96A are<br>
formed in first top surface 94A in alignment with tail portions 36A of the top row of<br>
terminals as seen clearly in Figures 4, 8 and 9 as well as the top view of the rear<br>
housing part in Figure 11. Grooves 96B are formed in second top surface 94B in<br>
alignment with tail portions 36B of the middle row of terminals. Grooves 96C are<br>
formed in bottom surface 94C as best seen in Figure 12 in alignment with tail portions<br>
36C (Fig. 5) of the bottom row of terminals. These grooves facilitate positioning the<br>
discrete electrical wires in alignment with the respective tail portions of the terminals,<br>
so that the center conductors of the wires can be laid immediately onto the tail<br>
portions for soldering purposes.<br>
This is seen in the sectional view of Figure 13, wherein an electrical wire 98A<br>
is shown with a conductor 100 on top of the tail portion 36A of one of the terminals<br>
24A in the top row thereof. Another wire 98B is shown with its conductor 100 on top<br>
of the tail portion 36B of one of the terminals 24B in the middle row thereof. A third<br>
wire 98C is shown with its conductor 100 immediately below tail portion 36C of one<br>
of the terminals 24C in the bottom row thereof. The discrete wires are shown with a<br>
portion of their outer insulating sheaths removed to expose their conductors 100. The<br>
insulated wires are positioned in grooves 96A-96C, as described above, whereupon<br>
their respective conductors are positioned against tail portions 36A-36C as seen in<br><br>
Figure 13, whereupon the conductors can be easily connected, as by soldering,<br>
to the tail portions of the terminals.<br>
It will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms<br>
without departing from the spirit or centra) characteristics thereof. The present<br>
examples and embodiments, therefore, are to be considered in ail respects as<br>
illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details<br>
given herein.<br><br><br>

least three rows of terminal-receiving passages (26) extending therebetween and<br>
including a top row, a middle row and a bottom row. A plurality of terminals (24A-<br>
24C) are received in the passages (26) and include top terminals (24A) received in at<br>
least some of the passages in the top row, middle terminals (24B) received in at least<br>
some of the passages in the middle row and bottom terminals (24C) received in at<br>
least some of the passages in the bottom row. All of the terminals (24A-24C) have<br>
forward contact portions and tail portions (36A-36C) projecting rearwardly from the<br>
body portion beyond the rear face thereof. The tail portions (36B) of the middle<br>
terminals (24B) are longer than the tail portions (36A) of the top terminals (24A). A<br>
wire management platform (40) projects from the rear face of the central body portion<br>
and includes a first top surface (94A) at which the tail portions (36A) of the top<br>
terminals (24A) are juxtaposed. A second top surface (94B) of the platform is offset<br>
from the first top surface (94A) and projects further from the rear face of the body<br>
portion than the first top surface and at which the longer tail portions (36B) of the<br>
middle terminals (24A) are juxtaposed. The platform includes a bottom surface (94C)<br>
at which the tail portions (36C) of the bottom terminals (24C) are juxtaposed.</td>
