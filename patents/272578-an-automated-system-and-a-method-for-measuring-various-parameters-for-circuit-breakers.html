DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an automated system for measurement of various parameters for circuit breakers. It is known in the circuit breakers/air circuit breakers (ACB) drive shaft is the moving part which has moving contacts, when the breaker is closed or opened the shaft rotates, during its rotation the contacts closes at some point of travel and finally shaft stops. During opening similarly the shaft rotates in reverse direction and contacts opens.<br>
The system of the present invention facilitates measurement of closing speed, opening speed angle of rotation, bounce time, number of bounce, closing and opening time, rebounce angle and the like and combinations thereof. The system of the present invention comprises a sensing means mounted on the shaft of the circuit breakers (herein the circuit breaker is an air circuit breaker) . However, air circuit breaker does not restrict the scope of the present invention and the system of<br>
5<br>
 <br>
the present invention can be used in any other circuit breakers. The sensing means is a rotary potentiometer mounted on the shaft of the product under test. The mounting of the potentiometer is done in a manner that rotation of shaft makes the potentiometer to rotate and the angle of rotation is transferred to converter means.<br>
The converter means is a signal conditioning module which measures the resistance change of potentiometer in the form of potential change. The breaker contact continuity signal is also converted into potential change. The system further comprises a high speed data acquisition card which receives the data output from the said potentiometer. The data acquisition card used in the present invention has sample frequency upto 100 KHz where each signal is sampled by 10 KHz. However, this sample frequency is not to be considered as restricting the scope of the present invention and any other data acquisition card with high order or lower order of sample frequencies can be used and still the invention can be performed.<br>
The processing means of the present invention receives the sampled data output from the data acquisition means. The captured data is analyzed adopting a computer program. Velocity of the shaft at the point of closing and/or opening of contacts, total angle of rotation, bounce time and number of bounce for the breaker contacts, closing/opening time and re-bounce angle are the parameters derived and displayed on computer screen. Graphical display of all channels is also available to analyze the signal manually.<br>
Data captured is stored in the database for analysis on product and processes. The reference values are also stored in the database, actual values are compared with reference value<br>
6<br>
 <br>
and OK / not OK decision also given by the software. Additionally, data can be viewed and reproduced graphically in testing station from stored data and can also be analyzed at a remote place. Further the system can be further enhanced through data/screens in HTML format over internet for remote analysis. However, such HTML format should not be considered as restriction of the present invention and any other format can be used and still the invention can be performed.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention describes a method for measuring closing speed, opening speed angle of rotation, bounce time, number of bounce, closing and opening time, rebounce angle and the like for circuit breakers. The position changes of contactors are sensed in form of resistance changes. The acquired information/data on the breaker contact travel or position change measured in the form of change in resistance of the potentiometer is then converted into potential changes by means of converter means and communicated to a data acquisition means for sampling wherein all potential changes are sampled. The sampled data/information are then analyzed in a processing means so as to extract required information on closing speed, opening speed angle of rotation, bounce time, number of bounce, closing and opening time, rebounce angle and the like for the circuit breakers.<br>
Advantages :<br>
•	It gives indication on proper working of mechanism which is heart of the circuit breaker.<br>
•	The measurement of the parameters is done in a manner that there is no physical device pushing the shaft of the breaker. So the measurement is true reflection of actual operation.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
•	Correctness  of  critical  items  and  freeness  of moving parts, spring values etc. can be verified in one shot.<br>
•	Helps  in  analyzing  effect  of  change  in  component  or process.<br>
•	Historical  trend  and  analysis  possible  for  selected parameters.<br>
