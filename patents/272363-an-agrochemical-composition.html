3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an agricultural composition comprising an effective amount of at least one pesticidal active ingredient, an effective amount of sulphur, an effective amount of zinc and at least one agrochemically acceptable excipient. The invention further relates to a method of application of the agricultural composition to crops.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Current farming practices are greatly challenged with an increasing labour shortage, water shortage, demand on high and quality yields, leaching of fertilizers and pesticides, micronutrient deficiencies in the soil, etc. There is a greater need today to optimize farming practices by reducing the number of applications of various fertilizers and pesticides, reduce the burden on the environment by reducing the number of chemical adjuvants and excipients being added to the soil and the crops, and despite that increase the yield of crops.<br>
Besides the application of the larger nitrogen and phosohate fertilizers, there is a need to apply sulphur as well as zinc in the early stages of the plant cycle, for instance in some cereal crops, typically in the first 5-35 days after planting or at the time of land preparation. There is also a need to apply certain pesticides thereafter, for instance, certain insecticides to control infestation of soil hibernating pest species. It is observed that many of the above applications of fertilizers and the pesticides, due to their current forms, are applied at higher rates, with increased number of applications, which also end up placing a large burden on the environment in terms of chemical excipients and adjuvants added  to the soil or applied to the crops. This also increases the cost of the application for the farmers.<br>
In view of the same, there is a need to develop a composition, which is synergistic and provides suitable nutrients to the soil on one hand, and is also simultaneously able to provide a pesticidal control for managing various pests. There is also a need to reduce the burden on<br>
 <br>
the environment, reduce the amount of chemicals added to the soil and the crop and also reduce the burden on the farmer, in terms of labour and costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have determined that an agricultural composition comprising an effective amount of at least one pesticidal active ingredient, an effective amount of sulphur, an effective amount of zinc and at least one agrochemically acceptable excipient, not only demonstrated excellent efficacy against various pests, but also improved various physiological factors like tillering, while providing a higher yield at lower rates of application.<br>
It has now been observed, that the compositions at very low concentrations of the active ingredients along with reduced quantities of excipients can be applied effectively, with minimum number of applications, thereby reducing the burden on the environment. The compositions disclosed herein, can also be applied effectively as a single application comprising sulphur, zinc and pesticidal active ingredient that saves not only the additional labour but also the vital cost of solo application of individual components as per conventional farming practices. The compositions also effectively address the need of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) in a single application.<br>

 <br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates a comparison of the dispersibility of the prior art fertilizer composition (110) and a composition in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention (120) after 30 minutes.<br>
According to an embodiment FIGURE 3 illustrates a top view of a comparison of the dispersibility of the prior art fertilizer composition (110) and a composition in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention (120) after 30 minutes.<br>
The prior art fertilizer composition (110) does not disperse even after 30 minutes and thus it cannot be effectively used in micro irrigation systems. This poses a great challenge to the end user. The composition (120) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention remains uniformly suspended in water over an extended period of time showing a full bloomed dispersion. The composition according to the embodiment can be used effectively and efficiently in micro irrigation systems such as trickle, drip or sprinkler irrigation.<br>
According to an embodiment, water dispersible granule compositions comprising sulphur, zinc and a pesticidal active ingredient can be made by various processes such as spray drying, fluid bed spray drying, extrusion, pan granulation, etc. One way of making water dispersible granular compositions which include sulphur, zinc and the pesticidal active ingredient, involves initially blending required additives such as wetting agents, dispersing agents, fillers to obtain an additive mix. The above mixture is wet milled using a bead mill to obtain an average particle size of the mixture of less than 50 μ, preferably less than 15 μ, preferably 0.2 to 10 u to obtain the mill base. The mill base is granulated in an appropriate spray drier or other drying methods with an outlet of a suitable temperature followed by sieving to remove the under sized and oversized granules, to obtain a WG formulation comprising sulphur, zinc and a pesticidal active ingredient in combination.<br>
Alternately, wettable powder compositions of sulphur, zinc and a pesticidal active ingredient can be prepared by blending required additives such as wetting agents, dispersing agents, fillers to obtain an additive mix. The mixture is then micronized using a suitable mill like fluid energy mill, jet mill, pin mill, hammer mill to an average particle size of the mixture of less than 50 u, preferably less than 15 u, preferably 1 to 15 u to get the WP formulation comprising sulphur, zinc and pesticidal active ingredient in combination. Wettable Powder<br>
 <br>
can be made in broadcast granules by various processes such as pelletization, compaction etc or other techniques known in art.<br>
According to an embodiment, the invention relates to a method of application of an effective amount of the agricultural composition, wherein the composition is applied to crops through foliar spray or soil application or through drip irrigation or trickle irrigation. Preferably the composition is applied as a soil application, for example, broadcast granules. More preferably the composition is applied through various micro irrigation systems such as drip, trickle or sprinkler irrigation.<br>
It has been observed that the number of applications to control wide range of pests appearing at the same time is minimized. The compositions display excellent synergy and are highly safe to the user and to the environment. The compositions are also cost-effective, as they provide much greater simultaneous control and can be used in a variety of crops with a broader spectrum of protection healthy foliage, improved crop yield and better grain quality. The agrochemical compositions in practice, reduces the number of applications of various individual fertilizer and pesticidal treatements and serves a dual purpose of simultaneously managing the damage caused by pests and meeting the fertilizer requirement in the initial stages of plant growth. One of the major advantages of the composition is the application in micro irrigation systems such as drip, trickle or sprinkler irrigation. The other advantages include reduction in the costs from water, energy, labour, chemical sources. The composition of the present invention improves plant vigour by delivering water, pesticide and nutrients directly to the plant roots and rhizophere in a single application. The composition is thereby more economical and beneficial to the end-users when compared with the present practices of solo application of the pesticide granules or zinc and sulphur fertilizer that saves not only the additional labour but also the vital cost of solo Sulphur fertilizer.<br>

It is also to be noted that the three way application of Sulphur 50% + ZnS04 30% + Fipronil 0.4 Gr. at 6250+1237+50 grams (active ingredient), per ha (Treatment 5) at reduced dosages also showed more number of tillers and high grain and straw yield in comparison to Sulphur 90%WG at 6750 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 9) , ZnS04 (33%) powder at 4125 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 10) and Fipronil 0.3 Gr at 75 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 11) used alone.<br>
It was also noticed that the application of Sulphur 78% + ZnO 10%+ Fipronil 0.6% Gr. at 9750 + 1000 + 62.5 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 8) proved to be effective and showed high number of tillers and high yield in comparison to Sulphur 90%WG at 6750 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 9), Fipronil 0.3 Gr at 75 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 11) used alone and Sulphur 65% + Zn018% pastilles (prior art fertilizer composition) at 8125+1800 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 7). It was further observed that the composition showed dispersibility greater than 90% when added to water.<br>
It was observed that the application of Sulphur 65% + Zn018% pastilles (prior art fertilizer composition) at 8125+1800 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 7) did not exhibit dispersibility in water and were observed to settle down when added to tanks containing water.<br>
It was also observed that the application of Sulphur 30%+ ZnS04 45%+ Cartap HCL 10%Gr. at 3750+ 1856 + 1250 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 3) was highly effective in comparison to stand alone application of Sulphur 90%WG at 6750 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 9), ZnS04 (33%) at 4125 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 10) and Cartap HCL 4% WP at 1000 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 12)<br>
 <br>
Apart from controlling the larvae of Scirpophaga incertulas, the composition in varying concentrations also displayed a valuable impact on the physiological factors like improved foliage (greenness) in paddy and an increase in the number of tillers, contributing to higher yield.<br>
The above compositions serve a dual purpose of simultaneously managing the damage caused by shoot borer and meeting the sulphur and zinc requirements in the initial stages of plant growth with a reduced number of applications.. The composition is thereby more economical and beneficial to the end-users when compared with the present practices of solo application of fipronil granules, zinc and sulphur fertilizer that saves not only the additional labour but also the vital cost of solo Sulphur fertilizer.<br>
Example 2: Bio-efficacy of Sulphur+ Zinc sulpahate + Imidacloprid Granule:   .<br>
The trial was conducted in Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh State in India on sugarcane. The experiments were conducted using Sulphur 90% WG standalone, Imidacloprid 70%WS standalone and Zinc Sulphate 33% standalone used as standards for comparison as well as an untreated control. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design and keeping all the agronomic practices uniform for all the treatments.<br>
It is to be noted that all the treatments were applied at 45th DAP {Days after planting) and 25 suckers were planted in a row for each treatment, along with setts of furrows at the time of planting and the same dose were applied<br>
It is also to be noted that the combination and the insecticide used alone with the untreated check were evaluated against termites on sugarcane.<br>
The data represents the cumulative presentation after both the application (at planning and at 50th Days after planting)<br>
The germination percentage was noted down in all the treatments and replications<br>

It was observed that the application of Sulphur 35% +ZnS04 45% + Imidacloprid 0.3% Gr. at 6300+2673+54 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 2) at reduced dosages as compared to standard practices, surprisingly proved to be highly effective, showed eighty eight percent of successful sett germination, with least percentage of termite attack and also showed maximum yield in comparison to Sulphur 90% WG at 6750 grams (active ingredient) per ha (Treatment 5), ZnS04 33% at 4125 grams (active ingredient) per ha (Treatment 4) and Imidacloprid 70% WS at 87.5 grams (active ingredient) per ha (Treatment 6) used alone.<br>
 <br>
The three way application of Sulphur 30% +ZnS04 60% Imidacloprid 0.5% Gr. at 5400+3564+90 (Treatment 3) also showed seventeen percent more germination and high yield in comparison to Sulphur 90% WG at 6750 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 5), ZnS04 33% powder at 4125 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 4) and Imidacloprid 70% WS at 87.5 g.a.i per ha (Treatment 6) used alone.<br>
The composition not only provided an effective control over termites but also displayed an increase in the thickness of the sugarcane stem. Besides the internodes length and eventually the height of the cane was significantly improved when compared with the treatment where sulphur and Imidacloprid used alone.<br>
The composition also demonstrated various other benefits such as increase in the girth, height, internode lengths and thickness of the cane as compared to the observations with the use of imidacloprid alone.<br>
The above composition in practice serves the purpose of simultaneously managing the damage caused by termites and the need of sulphur and zinc required in the initial stages of plant growth. The composition is thereby rendered highly economical and beneficial to the end-users when compared to the standalone compositions of Imidacloprid or sulphur or zinc sulphate. The above composition also restricts the undue loading of a carrier such as sand which is present upto a large extent in standalone pesticidal compositions<br>
