				<td>A METHOD FOR MOLDING SYNTHETIC RESIN MOLDINGS<br>
The description of this application claims benefit of priority based on Japanese Patent Application No.2005-154944, the entire same contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for molding various kinds of synthetic resin moldings. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for molding thermoplastic elastomer resin moldings preferably used as medical containers such as infusion containers, blood collecting tubes, and the like, or as plug bodies to which a needle can be stuck in medical caps.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Conventionally, as a method for molding using synthetic resin raw materials, compression molding methods by which resin raw materials which were put in a mold are pressurized and molded has been proposed as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.2003-275378 .<br>
However, unlike generally used injection moldings, in the above mentioned compression moldings, a block of a resin raw material is pressurized and molded in a mold, and therefore,<br><br>
metering and injection are not conducted at the same time, while pressurizing is applied while filling in the mold as injection moldings. Therefore, in compression moldings, a resin cannot be replenished during the molding process and contents or shapes change in said mold. Therefore, when the amount of resin raw materials to be put is too much, burr is likely to occur, while on the other hand, when the amount of resin raw materials to be put is too little, prescribed moldings cannot be obtained and become defective. Therefore, to establish a method for putting raw materials in a mold made up of a bottom force and an top force, and to set condition for putting raw materials are the important issues to be solved in a compression molding method. In particular, in the case of a plug body for infusion in which sticking operations are conducted using injection needles and the like, unlike thin moldings such as packings obtained by compression moldings such as mere press moldings/ single resin moldings must be obtained which hhave thickness and have uniform quality as a whole since it is necessary that said moldings are provided in an opening portion of an infusion container which is set upside down at the time of use and that liquid leakage of infusion in a container must be prevented in keeping the state of the infusion container being upside down. In this regard, such kinds of conventional molding methods do not necessarily disclose satisfactory technology regarding methods for feeding rawmaterials inmolds and feeding condition,<br><br>
and in particular, there has been no disclosure as to the methods for molding thick molds having uniform quality as a whole by compression molding methods.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to solve the above mentioned problems and the object of the present invention lies in providing a method for molding synthetic resin moldings capable of continuously obtaining thick synthetic resin moldings having uniform quality as a whole.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, as one embodiment of the present invention, the molding method of a medical plug body is explained. However, the present invention is not limited to the explanation below.<br>
The molding method of the present invention at least comprises the steps of a heating process in which resin raw materials are heated, a raw material metering process in which said heated resin raw materials are metered and introduced into a cavity in a mold, and a compressing process (molding process) in which said introduced resin raw materials are molded (formed) applying pressure and compressing the resin raw materials to have plug body shapes. The specification of the present application hereby calls this series of process a compression molding method in the present invention.<br>
Fig.l is a schematic plan view showing one example of compression molding devices for carrying out the method of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a schematic side view in Fig.l. In Figs. 1 and 2, 100 is an extruder and 200 is a molding machine.<br>
101	is a hopper which puts raw materials in the extruder 100.<br>
102	is a nozzle for transmission which transmits melted resin<br>
raw materials which were heated and extruded by the extruder 100 to the molding machine 200.<br>
A molding machine 200 is, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, provided with a molding table 201 which intermittently rotates clockwise (in the direction of the arrow shown in Fig.l) . The molding table 201 is provided with a metering station 202 which meters melted resin raw materials fed from said nozzle for transmission 102, a compressing station which compresses and molds (forms) resin raw materials metered by this metering station 202, a cooling station which cools the moldings (molded products) molded in the compressing station, and an ejecting station 205 which ejects the moldings cooled in the cooling station 204. In addition, 210, 211, 212, and 213 are bottom forces installed on all sides of the molding table 201, and 103 is a top force forfeeding resin raw materials provided at the tip end portion of the nozzle for transmission 102, and 104 is a top force for molding.<br>
Therefore, according to this molding device, melted resin raw materials extruded from the extruder 100 are fed to the metering station 202 from the nozzle for transmission 102, and are metered by the top force for feeding 103 and the bottom force 210. The resin raw materials metered and put on the bottom force 210 rotates together with this bottom force 210 and after shifting to the position of the bottom force 211 of the compressing station 203, resin raw materials are compressed and molded (formed) by<br>
the rotated bottom force 210 and the top force for molding 104. After such molding, resin raw materials further rotate and shift to the position of the bottom force 212 of the cooling station 204 together with the bottom force 210, and then are cooled, and these cooled resin raw materials further rotate and shift to the ejection station 205 together with the bottom force 210 and are ejected.<br>
(Example 1 of a metering process)<br>
In the present embodiment, particular characteristics lie in the metering process in said metering station 202. Figs . 3-1 to 3-5 are schematic cross-sectional views of a nozzle for transmission 102 and the bottom force 210 of resin raw materials showing the metering process in the present embodiment in order. Fig.3-1 shows beginning, Fig.3-2 shows mold closing, Fig.3-3 shows filling of resins, Fig. 3-4 shows beginning of tearing off, and Fig.3-5 shows completion of metering.<br>
In the present embodiment, in Figs. 3-1 to 3-5, at the tip end portion 1021 of the nozzle for transmission 102, the top force for feeding 103 is provided. That is, as shown in drawings, the top force for feeding 103 makes up the tip end portion of the nozzle for transmission of melted synthetic resin raw materials. Inaddition, the top force for feeding 103 isprovided with the top force main body portion 1031 which closes the bottom force 210. Inside of the top force main body portion 1031, the<br>
feeding path 1032 to the bottom force continuously connected from the transmitting path 1023 in the main portion 1022 of said nozzle for transmission!02 is formed. Further, the feedingpath 1032 has the first feeding path 1032a which leads to a transmitting path 1023 of said main portion of the nozzle for transmission 1021 and the second feeding path 1032b which continues to the first feeding path and whose cross-sectional area gradually increases towards an opening portion 2101 of the bottom force. R are melted resin raw materials. Y is a virtual axis connecting a central axis of the nozzle for transmission 102, of the top force for feeding 103, and of the bottom force 210. In addition, in the present embodiment, although the feeding path 1032 has the second feeding path 1032 b whose cross-sectional area increases, it is naturally possible that the feeding path 1032 is made up of solely the first feeding path 1032a whose cross-sectional area does not increase.<br>
Therefore, in metering melted resin raw materials R, to a contact surface 1033 of the top force for feeding 103 which contains resin raw materials R in a melted state transmitted to the feeding path 1032 of the tip end portion 1021 from the transmitting path 1023 of main portion of the nozzle for transmission 1022 as shown in Fig. 3-1 (beginning), moldings are closed pressing a contact surface 2102 of the bottom force 210 as shown in Fig.3-2. In addition, as shown in Fig.3-2, CT1 is a cavity in a mold made up by closing the mold by an top force<br>
for feeding 103 and a bottom force 210.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 3-3 (filling of a resin) , resin raw materials R in a melted state transmitted from an extruder through the nozzle for transmission 102 are fed in a melted state to the opening portion 2101 in the bottom force 210 through a feeding path 1032 of said top force for feeding 103. By this, as shown in Fig. 3-3 (filling of a resin), said melted resin raw materials R are filled in the cavity in the mold CT1 formed by the feeding path 1032 and the cavity in a mold 2101 of the bottom force.<br>
After that, as shown in Fig. 3-4 (beginning of tearing of f), the bottom force 210 is pushed down, said synthetic resin raw materials R contained in said feeding path 1032 are extended, and as shown in Fig.3-4, the raw materials are torn off at the portion X where the rawmaterials have prescribed amount of resin blocks RX for molding, thereby obtaining molding resin blocks RX as shown in Fig.3-5(completion of metering).<br>
By the way, in the present embodiment, regarding the timing of pulling the end portion to which said melted synthetic resin raw materials R are fed, the pulling is made during the process where an outer surface or a surface is solidified, while an internal portion of the tip end portion maintains amelted state. To be specific, the pulling is made during the process of solidification by regulating a temperature of an inner wall surface of the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210 to be set below the melting point of resin raw materials which are<br>
filled in the opening portion 2101 so that the internal portion of resin raw materials filled in the opening portion 2101 maintains a melted state while the outer surface or the surface maintains solidification.<br>
Therefore, while the outer surface or the surface of the raw materials filled in the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210 are in the solidification process, the resin raw materials contained in the feeding path 1032 of the top force for feeding 1031 are in the melted state or closer to the melted state compared with the raw materials contained in the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210. Therefore, since the resin raw materials contained in the opening portion 2101 and the resin raw materials contained in the feeding path 1032 are in mutually different plural-phase states, the lowering of the bottom force 210 to the top force for feeding 1031 is realized as a state of extending the resin raw materials which are contained in the feeding path 1032, and further, by lowering the bottom force 210, the extended portion is torn off.<br>
From these, the temperature of the feeding path 1032 of the top force for feeding 1031 is preferably set over the melting point of said synthetic resin raw materials, and the temperature of the bottom force 210, in particular, the temperature of the inner wall surface of its opening portion 2101 is set to be less than the melting point of said synthetic resin raw materials. Although the embodiment of the present invention is not<br>
specifically limited, it is preferable that the temperature of said f eedingpath is set higher than themeltingpoint of synthetic resin raw materials by 10 to 20°C and that the temperature of the bottom force is set to be within the range of 10 to 80°C.<br>
In addition, although said embodiment makes the bottom force 210move vertically to the top force for feeding 1031 thereby detaching and shifting said bottom force 210 from said feeding path 1032 for tearing off, the top force for feeding 1031 may move vertically to the bottom force 210.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment, regarding the feeding path 1032 to said bottom force, by providing not only the first feeding path 1032a which leads to the transmitting path 1023 of said main portion of the nozzle for transmission 1022 but also the second feeding path 1032b which continues to the first feeding path and whose cross-sectional area gradually increases towards an opening portion 2101 of the bottom force, as shown in Figs. 3-3 and 3-4, pulling and tearing off of the resin raw materials are easily made and the shapes of resin raw materials RX which were placed and remained on the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210 are easily modified and therefore, such embodiment is preferable. However, it is possible to provide the feeding path 1032 in which the first feeding path 1032a continues without providing the second feeding path 1032b.<br>
(Compressing process (molding process))<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 4-1, the resin rawmaterials RX which are metered, placed and remained on the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210, with the rotational movement of the bottom force 210 together with the molding table 201, shift to the compressing station 203. In addition, in this compressing station 203, the top force for molding 104 of the present embodiment is made up of a tubular body, and in the axis direction in this top force for molding 104, a molding pin is internally installed and is vertically slidable.  In addition, at the initial stage of the compressing process, as shown in Figs.4-1 and 4-2, this top force for molding 104 is holding the space SI which takes in the resin raw materials RX which have jumped out of the upper side being left from the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210.<br>
Therefore, as shown in Fig.4-2, the bottom force 210 in which these torn resin blocks RX for molding are placed and remained is pushed up to the top force for molding 104, and the mold is closed by bringing a contact face 2102 of the bottom force 210 into contact with a contact face 1042 of the molding top force 104. Further, after taking the resin raw materials RW which were jumped out of the opening portion 2101 in the space SI, as shown in Fig.4-3, by making the molding pin 1041 in the top force for molding 104 slide downward, the above mentioned resin raw materials RW are compressed and molded (formed) by the cavity in the mold CT2 formed by this top force for molding<br>
104 and the bottom force 210.<br>
(Other metering process/metering process 2) Fig.5-1 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the other metering process in the molding method of the present invention, and said Fig.5-1 shows the state in which the top force for feeding 300 and the bottom force 210 close the mold and the melted resin raw materials R are filled in the cavity CT3 formed by the feeding path 301 of the top force for molding 300 and the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force.<br>
In this embodiment, unlike the above mentioned embodiment, as shown in Fig.5-1, the top force for feeding 300 is made up as the top force which is separate and independent from the nozzle for transmission 102. In other words, as shown in Fig. 5-1, the top force for feeding 300 is made up of a sliding portion 302 attached in the nozzle for transmission 102 vertically slidable in the axis direction to the nozzle for transmission 102 and the flange-like main body portion of the top force 303 continuing to this slide portion 302 and contacting with the nozzle for transmission 102 at the time of closing the mold, and inside of the top force for feeding 300 which leads from the sliding portion 302 to the main body portion of the top force 303, at the time of closing the mold, the feeding path 301 is provided in which one leads to the transmitting path 1023 of the main portion 1022 of said nozzle for transmission 102, and the other<br>
leads to the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210.<br>
Therefore, according to said top force for feeding 300, as shown in Fig.5-1, pressing the bottom force 210 to this top force for feeding 300, the mold is closed pushing up the top force for feeding 300 making the top force for feeding 300 slide to said nozzle for transmission 102, followed by feeding the melted synthetic resin raw materials from said feeding path 301 of the top force for feeding 300 to the opening portion 2101 inside of the bottom force, said synthetic resins are filled in the cavity in the mold CT3 made up by closing the mold with the top force for feeding 200 and the bottom force 210.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 5-2, by pushing down the bottom force 210, followed by sliding and lowering the top force for feeding 300 from the nozzle for transmission 102, the synthetic resin raw materials contained in this feeding path 301 are extended and are torn off at the portion X where the resin blocks RX have the prescribed amount, and as shown in Fig.5-3, the prescribed amount of resin blocks RX are placed and remained in the bottom force 210.<br>
According to this method, since the top force for feeding 300 is made up as a top force which is separate and independent from the nozzle for transmission 102 and since the synthetic resin raw materials are extended and torn off by making the top force main body portion 303 having the sliding portion 302 vertically slide, said extending and tearing can be achieved<br>
very easily. In addition, in the present embodiment, although the feeding path is made up of the first feeding path 3010 and the second feeding path 3011 which is continuous from the first feeding path 3010 and whose cross-sectional area gradually increases toward the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force as in said embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this as it is not limited to already mentioned embodiment.<br>
In the case of the present embodiment, regarding the timing of pulling the end portion to which said melted synthetic resin raw materials R are fed, the pulling is made during the process where the outer surface or the surface is solidified, while an internal portion of the end portion maintains melted state.<br>
To be specific, the pulling is made during the process of solidification by regulating a temperature of an inner wall surface of the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210 to be set below the melting point of resin raw materials which are filled in the opening portion 2101 so that the internal portion of resin raw materials filled in the opening portion 2101 maintains a melted state while the outer surface or the surface maintains solidification.<br>
Therefore, while the resin raw materials filled in the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210 are in the process of solidification, the resin raw materials contained in the feeding path 301 of the top force for feeding 300 is in a melted or nearly melted state. Thus, since resin raw materials<br>
contained in the opening portion 2101 and the resin raw materials contained in the feeding path 301 are in mutually different plural- phase state, lowering of the bottom force 210 to the top force for feeding 300 is realized as a state of extending the resin raw materials which are contained in the feeding path 1032, and further, by lowering the bottom force 210, the extended portion is torn off.<br>
From this, it is preferable that the temperature of the feeding path 301 of the top force for feeding 300 is set over the melting point of said synthetic resin raw materials as in the already mentioned embodiment and that the temperature of the bottom force 210, in particular, the temperature of the inner wall surface of the opening portion 2101 is set to be lower than the melting point of said synthetic resin raw materials. Although not specifically limited in the present invention, for example, it is preferable that the temperature of said feeding path 301 is set to be over the melting point of said synthetic resin raw materials by 10 to 20 °C, and that the temperature of the bottom force is set to be within the range of 10 to 80 °C.<br>
In addition, as in said embodiment, the resin blocks RX meteredby this method are molded into prescribed shapes by making the bottom force 210 in which the resin blocks RX are placed and remained in the opening portion 2101 rotate and shift to the compressing station, pushing up this bottom force 210 in the molding top force thereby closing the mold followed by<br>
compressing as mentioned before.<br>
(Other metering process/metering process 3)<br>
Fig. 6-1 is the schematic cross-sectional view showing the other metering process in the molding method of the present invention and the Fig.6-1 shows the state in which the melted resin raw materials R are filled in the cavity CT4 in which the top force for feeding 102 and the bottom force 400 used in said metering process 1 close the mold and which is formed by the feeding path 1032 of the top force formolding 102 and the opening portion 401 of the bottom force 400. In addition, regarding the top force for feeding 102 which makes up the nozzle for transmission 102 and its tip end portion 1021, the reference numerals show the same portions as those shown in said Figs. 3-1 to 3-5.<br>
In this method, the bottom force 400 is provided with a sliding core 402 which communicates to the opening portion of said bottom force 400 and a pin 403 which moves vertically and slidably in this sliding core 402.<br>
Therefore, as shown in Fig.6-2, by lowering said pin 402 synchronizing with the lowering of said bottom force 400 and by maintaining said raw materials resin RX' by negative pressure caused by the space S2 generated between the raw materials resin RX' and the pin 402 of the bottom force 400, said synthetic resin rawmaterials R contained in said feeding path 1032 are extended,<br>
and are torn off at the portion X where the resin blocks RX for molding have a prescribed amount.<br>
(Other metering process/metering process 4)<br>
Figs.7-1 to 7-3 are schematic cross-sectional views showing the order of each of other metering processes in the molding method of the present invention.<br>
According to the present method, as shown in Fig. 7-1, the resin raw materials R in a melted state fed from the tip end portion 1021 of the nozzle for transmission 102 extruded by the extruder 100 are cut with a cutter 500 as shown in Fig. 7-2, and are put in the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force 210, followed by compressing the resin blocks RXW which were put in the opening portion 2101 as shown in Fig.7-3, expanding on a cavity formed by the opening portion 2101 of the bottom force and top force (not illustrated) for molding thereby molding the resin raw material R.<br>
In this method, the metering of the resin raw materials R in the melted state is made by the amount regulated by an extruding speed of resins by the extruder 100 and a driving tact of a cutter 500.<br>
In the molding method of the present invention, it is also possible to incorporate as one process of the production process of the medical caps. In other words, when the medical cap is composed of a medical plug body and an outer frame which holds<br>
the medical plug body, after molding the medical plug body by the method of the present invention, the outer frame of the cap made of a synthetic resin is molded by the injection molding method or the compression molding method, thereby integrating said plug body and the outer frame. On the other hand, it is possible to integrally mold by molding the plug body by the method of the present invention after molding the outer frame. Further, it is possible to prepare medical caps by molding the medical plug body by the method of the present invention and by separately molding the outer frame, followed by fitting said plug body into said outer frame.<br>
(Raw material compositions)<br>
Resin raw materials used in the present invention are not specifically limited. There is no problem as long as they are synthetic resins applicable to the present molding method. For example, in additiontopolyolef inicresins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, polyisoprene, polypentene, ethylenevinylacetate copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, and the like, various kinds of polymers can be used such as polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polylactic acid, acrylic resin, methacrylic resin, polyamide, polyacetal, polycarbonate, thermoplastic polyester resins, fluorine resins, polyamide, thermoplastic polyether resins, thermoplastic elastomers, and the like.<br>
In particular/ since thermoplastic elastomers or compositions thereof have constant viscoelasticity, they are suitable for cutting or extending resins in a metering step, and also they are most suitable for employing the molding method of thepresent invention. Forexample, theyare generally called thermoplastic elastomer resin compositions, which mean that paraffin oils and olefinic copolymers are included in block copolymers. Basicperformance of thermoplastic elastomer resin compositions is determined depending on the kinds of the block copolymers. As specific examples of thermoplastic elastomer resin compositions used in the present invention, block copolymers of styrene series, olefin series, vinyl chloride series, urethane series, polyester series, polyamide series, and the like can be exemplified. Among them, SEBS (styrene ethylene butylenes styrene block copolymer) and SBPS (styrene butylenes propylene styrene block copolymer) which are hydrogenated styrene based block copolymers composed of vinyl aromatic compounds and conjugated diene-compounds are preferable since they are excellent in rubber characteristics and are suitable for the present molding method as well.<br>
Further, the thickness of medical plug bodies obtained by the production method of the present invention are thick moldings whose thickness is generally 1 nuu and preferably 2 to 10mm.<br>
According to the molding method of synthetic resin moldings<br>
in the present invention, since the metering is made by cutting the melted synthetic resin raw materials on the way of feeding thereby molding resin blocks placed and remained in a bottom force by the metering of cutting, the melted resin raw materials can be put with constant amount and const ant shapes, and there fore, even when thick moldings are used, synthetic resin moldings having uniform quality as a whole can be continuously obtained. In particular, since the molding method in which the melted synthetic resin rawmaterials are extended on the way of feeding, followed by tearing off the extended portion and molding the resin blocks which were torn off, metering of the resin raw materials can be made during the process of tearing off the extended portion and further, resin blocks which were torn off as resin raw materials which nearly equals to the shape molded by the top force can be obtained later, the change in contents and shapes of resin raw materials in said mold can be inhibited as much as possible and thick moldings with uniform quality and prescribed shapes can easily and continuously be molded in the minimum amount of resins assuming the final moldings.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
The molding method of the present invention can be utilized in the molding method of various kinds of synthetic res in moldings. In particular, in the medical field, the molding method of the present invention is suitable for the molding method of<br>
thermoplastic elastomer resinmoldings preferably used as a plug body to which a needle can be stuck for infusion containers or infusion caps.<br><br><br><br>
