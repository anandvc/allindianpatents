				<td>"Method and installation for recording and playing back<br>
sound".<br>
The invention relates to a method for recording and<br>
playing back sounds, particularly music, using at least<br>
partial stereo recording and playback techniques, and<br>
to a corresponding installation.<br>
For audio reproduction, it is known practice to use CD<br>
players, for example, which are generally equipped at<br>
least with two-channel stereo sound reproduction using<br>
two loudspeakers. In the cinema and video sectors, the<br>
"surround" method has been used for some time to<br>
provide 3D sounds and effects. This involves placing<br>
three loudspeakers in front of the listener, namely to<br>
the left, in the center and to the right, and two<br>
further loudspeakers behind the listener. This is<br>
supplemented by a bass loudspeaker (subwoofer), which<br>
can be arranged anywhere in the room; this method is<br>
called 5+1.<br>
The 5+1 surround method has been developed from the<br>
cinema sector and can now also be used for the private<br>
sector, although the special requirements for playing<br>
back music mean that it dan be used only to a limited<br>
extent in this sector and is not satisfactory In terms<br>
of audio esthetics. The sound reproduction, similarly<br>
to quadrophony, is still two-dimensional, i.e. it is in<br>
the listening plane of the listener.<br>
This is the starting point of the invention, whose<br>
object is to make possible three-dimensional sound<br>
reproduction which comes as close as possible to the<br>
natural experience, particularly for playing back<br>
music.<br>
The invention achieves this object with a method of the<br>
type named in the introduction by means of at least one<br>
2+2+2 recording and playback technique using a<br>
corresponding number of channels to produce a natural-<br>
sounding, realistic, three-dimensional audio image with<br>
left-to-right, front-to-back and up-and-down<br>
orientation.<br>
The invention makes possible three-dimensional<br>
reproduction of natural sounds, e.g. single voices in<br>
an orchestra, soloists, singers, and the like, in<br>
highly differentiated form. In this case, during<br>
playback, the listener can feel as though he is<br>
directly at the location of the concert, more or less<br>
in the concert room; he is not forced into a single<br>
position in the room in order to perceive the best<br>
sound; he can move in areas of the room, can change his<br>
position and can still perceive the three-dimensional<br>
sound.<br>
Refinements of the invention can be found in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
It can be advantageous in this context to provide for a<br>
recording technique using at least six channels and a<br>
playback technique on at least six loudspeakers, with<br>
two loudspeakers from the user's horizontal listening<br>
plane being arranged with a physical offset<br>
particularly in the upward direction, as is likewise<br>
provided for by the invention. In this case, the<br>
invention is not necessarily limited to the additional<br>
pair of loudspeakers being able to be offset<br>
exclusively in the upward direction; a slight downward<br>
offset, if appropriate, can also result in similar<br>
audio images, depending on circumstances in the room.<br>
The invention can also make provision for the two<br>
additional front loudspeakers to be arranged tilted at<br>
an angle of approximately 90° toward a wall of the<br>
room. This type of setup is particularly advantageous<br>
if the loudspeakers are in a room which is essentially<br>
rectangular from the point of view of the surface area,<br>
with the loudspeakers in the region of one of the<br>
narrower end walls, so that the additional pair of<br>
loudspeakers is oriented toward the longitudinal walls,<br>
and their sound emissions are reflected back to the<br>
listener off the wall.<br>
If such a setup is not possible, it is also possible<br>
for the supplementary loudspeakers to be positioned at<br>
the positions of the virtual setup locations produced<br>
by the reflection. To this end, the invention provides<br>
for these two loudspeakers to be arranged with a<br>
physical offset not only particularly in the upward<br>
direction, but also at the sides of the two front<br>
loudspeakers.<br>
In this context, the inventive procedure is<br>
additionally capable of extension; thus, the invention<br>
can provide for not only six channels to be used, but<br>
rather at least eight channels with corresponding<br>
reproduction.<br>
An installation for carrying out the method is<br>
distinguished by a channel playback unit, a control<br>
unit with a 2+2+2 loudspeaker configuration,<br>
particularly with two main loudspeakers to the left and<br>
to the right in front of the listener, two loudspeakers<br>
to the left and to the right behind the listener and<br>
two loudspeakers above the main loudspeakers, whose<br>
axis of radiation is oriented outward through 90° with<br>
respect to said main loudspeakers. During sound<br>
recording, in addition to the technique which is needed<br>
for the known stereo reproduction, additional<br>
recordings of the 3D sound and of the corresponding<br>
perspectives are used and recordings are made on at<br>
least six audio tracks.<br>
As already indicated above, the "DVD audio system" can<br>
be used for reproduction in this case, with the many<br>
times greater storage space allowing not just the two<br>
channels available on the CD recording to be utilized,<br>
but rather up to eight channels. In this case, the DVD<br>
system affords the opportunity to transmit a plurality<br>
of audio channels at the same time. It will be pointed<br>
out at this juncture that the "Dolby surround" method<br>
uses 5+1 channels, i.e. this also uses six channels,<br>
albeit for reproduction in one audio plane.<br>
The inventive method and the inventive installation<br>
have the advantage that the audio images can be<br>
reproduced with left-to-right, front-to-back and up-<br>
and-down orientation, and the system can be extended.<br>
Besides conventional stereophony, four, six or more<br>
loudspeakers can be used, with the system being able to<br>
be extended to a 2+2+2+2 system, i.e. a system<br>
operating with a total of eight transmission channels.<br>
It is noticeable that the present invention allows the<br>
"height dimension" of sound bodies, too, to be<br>
reproduced. Thus, by way of example, an orchestra sits<br>
tiered on a plurality of stages in mussel form. At the<br>
bottom are the strings, immediately behind them the<br>
woodwinds, then come the brass and the percussion, with<br>
a choir and also an organ possibly being positioned<br>
behind that.<br>
A full organ comprises various organs placed at<br>
different points in the room; thus, by way of example,<br>
the choir organ close to the listener, the great organ<br>
above or behind that, the swell organ, the pedal organ<br>
and finally the antiphonal organs, which can resonate<br>
from the ceiling. Even with chamber music, it is<br>
possible to hear which musicians are standing and which<br>
are seated.<br>
A listener in a concert room perceives not just the<br>
sound coming directly from the sound generator, but<br>
also the reflections off the side walls, ceilings and<br>
the like, so that the listener additionally builds up a<br>
perception about the size of the room in which he is<br>
currently situated. In this context, the invention is<br>
suitable for reproducing this realistically. A known<br>
stereo recording likewise contains these "3D sounds",<br>
but they are driven back into just one plane and are<br>
also reproduced in this one plane. This plane is<br>
situated in just one dimension behind the loudspeaker<br>
base.<br>
With the inventive procedure, the microphones are also<br>
positioned differently. The inventive perspective<br>
microphones are not positioned as normal supporting<br>
microphones close to or behind the instruments, but<br>
rather at a greater distance in order to allow the<br>
corresponding perspective, in which case the inventive<br>
2+2+2 sound recording can then be produced in the mixer<br>
console from this microphone position.<br>
In this context, the invention also makes provision for<br>
the distance between the two main loudspeakers to<br>
correspond to a base width (d) which expediently<br>
likewise corresponds to the distance from the listener,<br>
so that an isosceles triangle is produced, i.e. the two<br>
main loudspeakers are each at an angle of 30° to the<br>
optimum listening location, as is also desirable for<br>
simple stereo reproduction. The two top loudspeakers<br>
should optimally be at a height of half the width of<br>
the base above the ear level, i.e. the plane for the<br>
ears with the main loudspeakers. If the distance from<br>
the loudspeakers in the listening area is 2 m, for<br>
example, the additional front loudspeakers should be<br>
arranged at a height of 1 m above these planes. In this<br>
case, the back loudspeakers are expediently at the same<br>
distance, as much as possible, from the listener as the<br>
two front ones if this can be achieved, otherwise<br>
shorter distances can also be adopted, and the missing<br>
distance can be compensated for by oblique positioning<br>
and reflection off the wall and/or ceilings.<br>
In this case, the additional loudspeakers should, if<br>
possible, be oriented away from the listener onto the<br>
respective wall of the room. If this is not possible,<br>
virtual locations can be ascertained at which the<br>
additional loudspeakers can then be positioned; this<br>
means offset with respect to the main loudspeakers both<br>
to the side and possibly toward the back and<br>
vertically.<br>
Other features and details of the invention are<br>
revealed in the description below and with reference to<br>
the/drawing, in which<br>
figure 1 shows a simplified side view of a room for<br>
sound reproduction,<br>
figure 2 shows a plan view of this room in a very<br>
highly simplified depiction,<br>
figure 3 shows a side view with microphone positioning<br>
for an orchestra, and<br>
figure 4 shows a side view of microphone positioning<br>
for a large organ.<br>
The room, denoted generally by 1, contains a listener<br>
la and, in the example depicted in figures 1 and 2, six<br>
loudspeakers, namely a left-hand main loudspeaker 2 and<br>
a right-hand main loudspeaker 1, each oriented toward<br>
the listener la, and two back loudspeakers 4 and 5 and<br>
two additional loudspeakers 6 and 7 which are arranged<br>
above the loudspeakers 2 and 3 and are arranged<br>
outwardly directed through 90° with respect to the main<br>
loudspeakers 2 and 3, as indicated in figure 2.<br>
This means that sound reproduction can be depicted not<br>
just in the listening plane 8 indicated in dashes in<br>
figure 1, but rather three-dimensional sound<br>
reproduction fundamentally corresponding to the natural<br>
audio image is possible.<br>
Figure 3 shows the possible positioning of recording<br>
microphones, with the microphones 9 and 10 representing<br>
nondirectional microphones, which can also be suspended<br>
from the ceiling of a room, for delivering the 3D sound<br>
to a mixer console, denoted generally by 11.<br>
The main microphones, of which one is shown, are<br>
denoted by 12 and are generally situated in the front<br>
areas of a stage on which there are, by way of example,<br>
the strings in a first position 13, the woodwinds in a<br>
second position 14, the brass in a somewhat raised<br>
further position 15, with the percussion instruments at<br>
a position 16, and a choir and also possibly an organ<br>
being able to be positioned behind that at 17. In this<br>
case, "perspective microphones" are used, denoted in<br>
the figure by 18a to 18c. The information from these<br>
microphones is also supplied to the mixer console and<br>
is processed there.<br>
Figure 4 shows the possible positioning of recording<br>
microphones in the case of a large organ, e.g. the<br>
organ in a church or an orchestral organ in a concert<br>
room. The organ player, denoted by 19, sits at the<br>
keydesk customary for such instruments, the individual<br>
elements of the organ being indicated merely<br>
symbolically in this case:<br>
The figure indicates a choir organ 20, a chest organ<br>
21, a great organ 22, swell organs 23, 24 and an<br>
antiphonal organ 25. The main microphone again bears<br>
the reference 12, and the perspective microphones are<br>
denoted by 18c and 18e in this case, with these merely<br>
being setup options.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 depict assigned distances. Thus, the<br>
best sitting position for stereo recordings is found to<br>
be the apex of an equilateral triangle formed by the<br>
listener la and the main loudspeakers 2 and 3; in<br>
figure 2, the limbs of this triangle are denoted by<br>
"a,b,d", and the distance of the listening plane 8 is<br>
denoted by "o" in figure 1.<br>
As figure 1 likewise reveals, the best distance in<br>
height between the additional front loudspeakers 6 and<br>
7 and the main loudspeakers 2 and 3 is half the<br>
horizontal distance between the latter, i.e. h = ½ d,<br>
this dimension also [lacuna] shown in figure 1.<br>
Alternative positions for, by way of example, the<br>
additional top loudspeakers 6 and 7 directed onto the<br>
room wall, at positions where there are no room walls,<br>
are denoted in figure 2 by 6' and 7'; alternative setup<br>
locations for the back loudspeakers 4 and 5 are denoted<br>
by 4' and 5' .<br>
Naturally, the described exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention can also be modified in many respects without<br>
departing from the basic concept. Thus, the positions<br>
of the loudspeakers 2 and 3 can also be offset slightly<br>
downward, and can then possibly be tilted slightly<br>
upward to the listening location. This also applies to<br>
the additional loudspeakers 6 and 7; these can also be<br>
offset slightly forward or backward from their freed<br>
vertical plane in order possibly to be able to take<br>
into account intentional peculiarities of the setup<br>
location.<br>
