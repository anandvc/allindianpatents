COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
                (See Section 10, rule 13)<br><br><br>
AN IMPROVED ELECTRICAL SOCKETS<br><br>
MANOJ   HANSRAJ  GADA COMPOUND, GOREGAON (W) , INDIAN national<br>
of  B~36,  MANJU  NIKETAN,   TOPIWALA MUMBAI - 400 062, MAHARASHTRA, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is/'to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br>
11 APR 2002<br><br>
29-12-2005<br><br><br><br>
AN IMPROVED ELECTRICAL SOCKET<br>
The invention relates to electrical/electronic multiple sockets in a single piece with screwless installation. More particularly it relates to electrical socket without screw fixing having a child safety shutter between the top and bottom member to prevent accidental shock.<br>
The prior art sockets of three pin type having holes at 120 degrees apart so as to three pin plug member can be inserted in this holes. Since these holes at the back are connected with electrical installation a possibility of getting shocked by inserting fingers preferably from child thereby the child get electrical shock which can be fatal. The dual type two pin and three pin plugs has been combined in the present invention along with safety shutter for child along with improved biasing means. The bottom member is a moulded plastic box type construction open at one end having three openings for the contacts to pass through the front side. The said contacts are dual contacts one for 6 Amp. and other for 16 Amp. Copper, phosphorous bronze 'A' grade material rigidly connected with the terminal for electrical installation. The said bottom member is covered by a flap member which covers the entire space and locks itself substantially at the top of the bottom member by means of groove and projection inter locking arrangements. There is a child safety shutter on the top of the flap member provided with a biasing means so as to cover the live contacts for the reach of the children to avoid accidental shocks. A top flap member with a decorative colour and design is with matching dual grooves of the sockets is fitted on the bottom member in a push fit manner by groove and projection provided on top and bottom members.<br>
The principal object of this invention is therefore to provide an electrical socket without screw fixing having a child safety shutter between the top and bottom member to prevent accidental shock.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide electrical socket member for installation which is cost effective, easy to manufacture and users friendly. Still further object of this invention is to provide electrical socket member for installation which can be used<br><br>
with different coloured and designed flap members for good aesthetic look with mono and multi colour combination.<br>
Accordingly there is provided An improved electrical socket made from moldable plastic material having a box type bottom member and a flap member having overlapping duel openings of the 3 pins which are connected to individual metal connectors from the back and connected to the terminals and earthing, wherein a child safety shutter is provided in between the bottom member and the flap member which covers the connectors partially so as to avoid direct touch of the childs finger with the connectors to safe guard child from electrical shock; the said child safety shutter is moving on the guide members by means of biasing means whenever plug member is inserted in the multiple plug system; the said top duel grooves is covered by the triangular front member (9) of the child shutter which is pressed back whenever the plug is introduced. The flap member is made from moldable plastic material of mono or multiple colours and designs. Also the flap member is coated with enamel. The base member of the child safety shutter and the flap member are fastened by push fit manner without any metals screwing.<br>
The invention will now describe with reference to figure 1 to 4 in the accompanying specification.<br>
Fig. 1 is a elevation view of the electrical/electronic socket member for installation.<br>
Fig. 2 is the top view of the electrical/electronic socket member for installation.<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the electrical/electronic socket member for installation.<br>
Fig. 4 is a exploded view of the components serially in unassembled condition. Referring to figure 1 to 4 An improved electrical socket (1) made from moldable plastic material having a box type bottom member (2) and a flap member (3) having overlapping dual openings of the 3 pins (4) which are connected to individual metal connectors from the back and connected to the terminals (5) and earthing, wherein a<br><br>
child safety shutter (6) is provided in between the bottom member and the flap member which covers the connectors partially so as to avoid direct touch of the child finger with the connectors to safe guard child from electrical shock; the said child safety shutter is moving on the guide members (7) by means of biasing means (8) whenever plug member is inserted in the multiple plug system; the said top dual opening is covered by the triangular front member (9) of the child shutter which is pressed back whenever the plug is introduced. The flap member is made from moldable plastic material of mono or multiple colours and designs. The flap member is coated with enamel. The base member of the child safety shutter and the flap member are fastened by push fit manner without any metals screwing.<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	An improved electrical socket (1) made from moldable plastic material having a box type bottom member (2) and a flap member (3) having overlapping dual openings of the 3 pins (4) which are connected to individual metal connectors from the back and connected to the terminals (5) and earthing, wherein a child safety shutter (6) is provided in between the bottom member and the flap member which covers the connectors partially so as to avoid direct touch of the child finger with the connectors to safe guard child from electrical shock; the said child safety shutter is moving on the guide members (7) by means of biasing means (8) whenever plug member is inserted in the multiple plug system; the said top dual opening is covered by the triangular front member (9) of the child shutter which is pressed back whenever the plug is introduced.<br>
2.	An improved electrical socket as claimed in claim 1 wherein the flap member is made from moldable plastic material of mono or multiple colours and designs.<br>
3.	An improved electrical socket as claimed in claim 1 wherein the flap member is coated with enamel.<br>
4.	An improved electrical socket as claimed in claim 1 wherein the base member of the child safety shutter and the flap member are fastened by push fit manner without any metals screwing.<br>
5.	An improved electrical socket as claimed in claim 1 and substantially herein describe and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
