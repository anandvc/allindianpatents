2)       MR.      VICTOR      MIKHAILOVICH<br>
INYUSHIN,	(Citizen	of<br>
Khazakhstan), having address at BION Bio Physics Laboratory, 71, AL Farabi, Almaty, 410071, Khazakhstan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed :<br>
GRANTED<br>
27-08-2004<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
952-BOM-1999<br><br><br>
APPARATU5 FOR TREATMENT OF WATER	<br>
This invention relates to the Science of Sanitary Engineering in general and to the branch pertaining to water treatment in particular.<br>
The invention has as its principal object to propose such a construction of an -apparatus for the treatment of water as to dispense with physical and chemical and biological additives, catalytic agents and like materials.<br>
A further object of the invention is to treat water without resorting to the use of ultra violet rays or Gamma rays.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Treatment of water by physical or chemical additives or by Ultra High Frequency electro magnetic waves are known Arts. Thermal treatment for bulk quantity of water is impracticable. Calculation of the exact quantum of the chemical additives for the treatment of bulk quantity of water is very difficult and impracticable. Also, it is practically very difficult to adjust the duration of the electromagnetic treatment. Quite often even slightly excess use of the chemical additives or duration of electromagnetic treatment may be detrimental may prove to be harmful to the health of living beings in the surroundings.<br>
Application of Gamma rays for example should be for a fraction of a second. Instruments to switch off the circuit after that short duration cannot be used for vast areas in agricultural fields.<br>
A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
To obviate the serious disadvantages of the above cited systems the present invention is developed.<br><br>
Our experiments have shown that electric resonance with a mobile wave of high density of photo electric flux provides a bridge for the lacunae in the known arts.<br>
According to the present invention, the Apparatus provides mono chromatic polarized coherent light in the form of a static wave length of a particular nanometer (nm) followed by mono chromatic polarized coherent light of another particular wave length of nanometer (nm). The theme behind the use of two lasers is that mono chromatic polarized coherent light immobile wave is alternated with another mono chromatic polarized coherent light immobile wave of a different wave length so that water is irradiated with these impulses at various intervals. The said two lasers are connected to an electric power source through a timer. A water line having not less than two tubes are connected in consecutive order and aligned perpendicular to the axis of corresponding incoming light rays. At position above the inlet port of the Apparatus a semi transparent mirror is provided; and the opposite side is provided with an opaque mirror. The theme behind using the two mirrors is that the water is irradiated by the reflected beam between the two mirrors. The distance between the two mirrors is divisible by the wave length of corresponding mono chromatic polarized coherent light, lasers.<br>
In this invention the water irradiated with two mono chromatic polarized coherent lights in the form of immobile waves (laser) with periods of treatment from 1 second to 1000 seconds at intervals between mem from 0 second to 1000 seconds. The periods of light irradiation and the intervals between them form the definite code of water treatment which is selected depending on properties and needs of the biological object (chemical and biological contents of the water being treated) which this activated water is destined to. By mat, the phenomenon of photo synergison    is reached with maximum effect, that improves considerably the  quality of the water activation properties and a laminar water flow is not required; and so it raises considerably output of water treatment. The water whilst passing within the Apparatus is also supplied with bio plasma energy from bio plasma generator. The requirement for supplying bio plasma energy is that the bio plasma natural generators provide life force (prana energy) in the water which increases the life force energy in the water thereby making it superior for health.<br>
The invention is now explained with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 shows the schematic arrangement of the Apparatus.<br>
In the Figure : "1"  is the frame of the Apparatus; "2" are the dividers inside the frame of the Apparatus - 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f; "3" is the inlet port to which tube with inflowing water is attached; "4" is the outlet port to which the tube with outflowing water is attached; "5" are two chambers lined with copper strips. The theme behind lining the chamber with copper strips is that the copper strips increase the conductivity of light and life force energy in the treated water. "6" one chamber has copper plates attached,;"7"the copper strips are connected to two bio plasma natural generators; "8" the lid of the box is made of copper plate lining; "9" semi-conduct laser is attached to the box lid over the first chamber having the inflowing water; "10" facing the laser at the bottom of the box is a mirror; "11" laser is connected through laser Apparatus box - timer to main line electricity supply; "12" treated water flows through the chambers and out of the box through the outflow canal tube outside the other end of the box i.e. no. 4. The treated water flows out from outflow tube. The treatment duration is determined by quantity and nature    of       the      water   being   treated.    Laser  beam   is   radiated   with<br><br>
alternating periods; a period of 0-1000 seconds without light laser irradiation; and a period of treatment from 1 to 1000 seconds. The two laser beams are passed through the same port.<br>
The present invention "Apparatus For Treatment Of Water" has many advantages over conventional water treatment system, some of which are explained below.<br>
Physical or chemical additives or catalytic agents are not needed in the present invention which makes it cost-effective as compared to die conventional systems.<br>
The effect of the treatment on the water remains for about one month, which implies longer lasting purified water compared to the conventional systems.<br>
The structural activated water sets into the cells of biological objects and regulates the layer of bound water.<br>
Formation of ferment and substratum complex is enhanced by a rise in electronic conduction.<br>
The periods for the dark blue and red aqcue complexes can be varied according to the biological object - the chemical and biological contents of the water to be purified.<br>
A laminar water flow is not required. The light-laser"s resonance and immobile wave raises the density of luminous flux.<br>
The power consumption is minimal in the present invention.<br>
The anaerobic bacteria are made unconscious - so no death-force of dead bacteria (which is found in ultra violet treated water) exists here. This water enhances life force, hence even strict vegetarians can safely use this purified drinking water.<br>
The bio plasma natural generators provide life force (prana energy) m the water, making it of superior value for health.<br>
The longer lasting quality and higher purity of the treated water makes it more useful for pharmaceutical purposes where aqua solutions are used for medicinal purposes.<br><br>
