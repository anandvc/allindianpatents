DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Fig.8, a vertical flap 111 is located in an opening of an outlet grille 102 in an air conditioner 110, and a plurality of lateral flaps 101 linked with each other in an upwind side by a linking bridge are provided. As shown in Fig.7. an end portion 104 located in the downwind side of a mounting shaft 103 of the lateral flap 101 is cut off for handling condensed water 106 during a cooling-mode operation.<br>
However, in the conventional lateral flap 101 of such shape, when the lateral flap 101 is moved in the lateral direction during a cooling-mode operation, condensed water 106 is condensed in a surface of the lateral flap 101, as shown in Fig"7" If the condensed water 106 drops outside from the opening of outlet grille, the condensed water 106 falls inside a room where the air<br>
6.<br>
conditioner 110 is placed. In order to solve the problem, the end portion 1(34 of lateral flap 101 in a downwind side of the mounting shaft 103 provided in a lower part of the outlet grille 102 is cut off. In such manner, the condensed water 106 adhered to the lateral flap 101 is guided toward the mounting shaft 103, moves along a lower portion of the outlet grille 102, and flows into a water collecting groove 108 in a front frame 107. However, it has been a problem that the lateral flap 101 is reduced in capacity of direction change, which is a primary function it should achieve, if a cut-off amount of the end portion 104 is high, while the condensed water 106 falls inside a room, if a cut-off amount of the end portion 104 is low.<br>
Embodiments of air conditioner employing a direction changing device according to the invention are described below by referring to the drawings. Embodiment 1<br>
Figs 1 and 2 are perspective and sectional views of an air conditioner employing a direction changing device according to the invention. Figs. 3 and 4 azre magnified sectional views of the vicinity of an outlet grille in the air conditioner shown in Fig,2. Fig 7 is atop plan view showing a movable range of a lateral flap used in a direction changing device according to the invention.<br>
In Figs 1 and 2, such air conditioning members 16 as a heat exchanger and a fan are placed inside a main body 15 of an<br>
6A-<br>
air conditioner 10, and an outlet grille 2 is provided in a lower part of a front side of the air conditioner 10. In an opening of the outlet grille 2, a vertical flap 11 for changing the direction of air in the vertical direction is employed. In an upwind side of the vertical flap 11, a lateral flap I for changing the direction of air in the lateral direction is located, and the lateral flap 1 is provided with plural flap elements which are linked with each other by a linking bridge 9, respectively.<br>
In Figs. 2, 3 and 4, a part of the lateral flap 1 is attached to the main body 15 of air conditioner 10 by a mounting shaft 3, A convex portion 5 is formed in an end portion 4 In a lower part of the lateral flap 1. The convex portion 5 is adapted to be in the lowest level when the air conditioner 10 is installed in a room. The convex portion 5 is located in the downwind side in relation to the mounting shaft.3. The main body 15 of air conditioner 10 has a frame 7 in a lower part thereof, and a groove 8 for handling water is provided in the frame 7. The groove 8 is connected to a drain (not shown) for discharging water that is accumulated inside to outside. A wall of the outlet grille 2 located below the convex portion 5 of lateral flap 1 is provided with a lower portion 2a of an angled shape. The lateral flap 1 is pivotally movable over a predetermined angle in the lateral direction about the mounting shaft 3, and a distance between the lateral flap 1 and outlet;<br>
- 7 -<br>
grille 2 and an angle of inclination of the lower portion 2a of<br>
outlet grille 2 are predetermined for allowing the convex portion 5 of lateral flap 1 to approach the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2 without touching it when the lateral flap 1 is moved. The groove 8 described above is positioned below the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2. The convex portion 5 formed in the end portion 4 of lateral flap 1 is shaped such that condensed water 6 adhered to the lateral Flap 1 is gathered at the convex portion 5. As the convex portion 5, for example, an extension formed by extending the end portion 4 of lateral flap 1 may be provided. Alternatively, as the convex portion 5, for example, a convex member placed in the end portion 4 of lateral flap 1 may be employed.<br>
In such construction, in a cooling-mode operation, the lateral flap 1 is rotated from a position shown by a solid line to a position shown by a broken line in Fig.7, so that the direction of cool air produced by the apparatus neuters 16 incorporated in the main body 15 is changed in the lateral direction. When 3 turbulence is caused in the air, condensed water 6 is adhered to a surface of the lateral flap 1. In such case, the condensed water 6 flows toward the end portion-4 of lateral flap 1 located in the downwind direction. Then, the condensed water 6 is accumulated, and gathered at the convex portion 5. At that time, the convex portion 5 has already been moved from the position shown by a solid line to the position<br>
- 8 -<br>
shown by a broken line in Fig. 7, and is positioned closely to the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, as shown by a broken line 5a in Fig. 4, because an inclined surface is provided in the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, A distance between the convex portion 5 and lower portion 2a of the outlet grille 2 is predetermined such that the condensed water 8 is swiftly moved to the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2 when the condensed water 6 reaches the convex portion 5.<br>
The condensed water 6 gathered at the convex portion 5 is transferred to the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, when the convex portion 5 approaches the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, and flows down to the groove 8 formed in the front frame 7. In this regard, the condensed water 6 gathered at the convex portion 5 is transferred to the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2 by a wind force of the cool air. Alternatively, the condensed water 6 gathered at the convex portion 5 nay be brought into contact with the lower portion 2a when the convex portion 5 approaches the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2. Consequently, the condensed water 6 is prevented from dropping outside from the opening of outlet grille in the front side, and outflow of the condensed water 6 inside a room can be avoided as<br>
a result.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Embodiment 2 of the invention is now described.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 are sectional views of a main part of an<br>
- 9 -<br>
outlet grille in an air conditioner according to a second embodiment of the invention. In Figs, 5 and 6, instead of being in a cut-out shape, an end portion 4 of a lateral flap 1 is Provided with an extension 40 extending upwind from the end portion 4, Other parts are identical with those of Embodiment 1. In Figs. 5 and 6, when the end portion 4 of the lateral flap 1, which is in the upwind side of a mounting shaft in a lower portion 2a of an outlet grille 2, approaches an inclined surface of the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, and the lateral flap 1 is moved to a position shown by a broken line in Fig, 7, the end portion 4 is located in a position shown by a broken line in Fig, 6, In the embodiment, positioning of the lateral flap 1 is predetermined such that the extension 40 of end portion 4 is never touches the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2 because of a reason similar to that in Embodiment 1, It is particularly desirable that condensed water 8 gathered at the extension 40 is brought into contact with the lower portion 2a when the extension 40 approaches the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, In such construction, when the extension 40 of lateral flap 1 is moved closely to the lower portion 2a of outlet grille 2, the condensed water 6 accumulated to the extension 40 is transferred to the outlet grille 2, and flows down to a groove 8. As a result, outflow of the condensed water 6 front an opening of the outlet grille 2 in the front side to inside a room is avoided. Further, because the end portion 4 Is not cut<br>
- 10 -<br>
out, reduction in quantity of air received by the lateral flap can be prevented, and reduction in direction changing capacity is accordingly avoided in all operating modes including heating, drying and ventilation modes.<br>
As clearly shown in above Embodiments 1 and 2, according to the invention, by providing a convex portion or extension in a lateral flap, condensed water can be safely handled without being allowed to drop inside a room.<br>
Further, by providing an end surface of lateral flap near an inclined surface of a lower portion of outlet grille, condensed water can be safely handled in a cooling-mode operation of an air conditioner, and reduction in direction changing capacity otherwise caused by cutting-off of the end surface of lateral flap can be avoided in a movable range of lateral flap in all operating modes including heating, drying and ventilation modes.<br>
