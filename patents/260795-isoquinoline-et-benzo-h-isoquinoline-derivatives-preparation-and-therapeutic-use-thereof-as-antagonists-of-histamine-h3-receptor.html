Furthermore, in the context of the present invention, the term " protective group Pg "<br>
is understood to mean a group which makes it possible, on the one hand, to protect a<br>
reactive functional group, such as a hydroxyl or an amine, during a synthesis and, on<br>
the other hand, to regenerate the intact reactive functional group at the end of<br>
synthesis. Examples of protective groups and protecting and deprotecting methods<br>
are given in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3th Ed., Greene and Wuts<br>
(John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1999).<br>
A second subject-matter of the present invention is a process for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention.<br>
Thus, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to the process<br>
represented in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
According to the process of Scheme 1, the compounds of formula (I), in which R1,<br>
R2, I, m, n and the A ring are as defined in the formula (I), are prepared by<br><br>
nucleophilic substitution by reacting a phenol of formula (II), in which R2 and the A<br>
ring are as defined in the formula (I), with an amine of formula (III), in which R1, I, m<br>
and n are defined as in the formula (I) and Y represents a halogen atom, such as, for<br>
example, a chlorine, iodine or bromine, or represents a " pseudohalogen ", such as a<br>
methylate, triflate, tosylate, brosylate or nosylate. The reaction can be carried out in a<br>
protic or aprotic solvent, such as water, methanol, acetone, butanone, ethyl acetate,<br>
toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or a mixture of these solvents, at a<br>
temperature of between 0 and 110°C in the presence of a base, such as, for<br>
example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, to give the compound of formula<br>
(I). In the case of the mixtures of immiscible solvents, use may be made of a phase<br>
transfer catalyst, such as an ammonium or phosphonium salt, preferably<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide or tetraethylammonium chloride, in a mixture of toluene<br>
and water at a temperature of between 20 and 110°C. If necessary, the compounds<br>
of the formulae (II) and (III) can be protected beforehand before reaction according to<br>
methods known to a person skilled in the art. The compound of formula (I) is then<br>
optionally deprotected according to conditions known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to a reaction<br>
of Mitsunobu type. According to this alternative, a phenol of formula (II), in which R2<br>
and the A ring are as defined in the formula (I), is reacted with an amine of formula<br>
(III), in which R1, I, m and n are defined as in the formula (I) but Y represents a<br>
hydroxyl group, obtained according to methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The reaction can be carried out conventionally in the presence of Mitsunobu<br>
reagents, such as an azo derivative, for example diethyl azodicarboxylate, diisopropyl<br>
azodicarboxylate, di(tert-butyl) azodicarboxylate, 1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine or<br>
la N,N,N,N-tetramethylazodicarboxamide, and a phosphine, for example<br>
triphenylphosphine or tributylphosphine. The reaction can be carried out in an aprotic<br>
solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or a mixture of these solvents, at a<br>
temperature of between 0 and 100°C to give the compound of formula (I). The<br>
compound of formula (I), if the reactants have had to be protected beforehand before<br>
reaction, is deprotected according to conditions known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The protective starting compounds (formula (VI)) or the unprotected starting<br>
compounds (formula (II)) can be prepared according to Scheme 2 or can be<br>
synthesized by conventional methods known to a person skilled in the art, such as<br><br>
the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 40, 3997-4005 (1997) or Tetrahedron<br>
Asymmetry, 12, 2427-2434 (2001).<br><br>
According to the process of Scheme 2, the compounds of formula (II), in which R2 is<br>
as defined in the formula (I) but other than a hydrogen atom, are prepared by<br>
reductive amination by reacting a secondary amine of formula (IV), in which R2<br>
represents H, with an aldehyde or a ketone of formula (V), where R3 and R4, after<br>
reaction, together form R2 as defined in the formula (I) and other than hydrogen. The<br>
compounds of formula (IV), where R2 represents a hydrogen atom, can be obtained<br>
according to conventional methods known to a person skilled in the art, such as the<br>
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 40, 3997-4005 (1997). The compounds of formula (II)<br>
can subsequently be obtained from the compounds of formula (VI), which are<br>
deprotected according to conditions known to a person skilled in the art. For<br>
example, the compounds of formula (VI), when Pg is a methyl group, can be<br>
deprotected in the presence of an acid, such as hydrobromic acid, in a protic solvent,<br>
such as water or acetic acid or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of<br>
between 0 and 100°C in the presence or absence of a phase transfer catalyst, such<br>
as an ammonium or phosphonium salt, to give the phenol of formula (II). Illustrations<br>
of the process are given in the examples.<br>
Alternatively, according to the process of Scheme 3, the compounds of formula (II), in<br>
which R2 is as defined in the formula (I) but other than a hydrogen atom, can be<br>
prepared by reacting the protective compound of formula (VI), in which R2 represents<br>
a benzotriazolylmethyl group, for example obtained according to the process<br>
described in Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 12, 2427-2434 (2001), with an alkylating agent,<br>
such as an appropriate Grignard reagent.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br>
According to this alternative, the compounds of formula (II), in which R2 is as defined<br>
in the formula (I), are prepared by nucleophilic substitution by reacting a compound of<br>
formula (Via), in which R2 represents a benzotriazolylmethyl group, with a Grignard<br>
reagent of formula (VII), where W represents a halogen atom, such as, for example,<br>
a chlorine, iodine or bromine, and R5 represents a C1-5 alkyl, C1-2 perhaloalkyl, C1-3<br>
haloalkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl group, a monocyclic heteroaryl, such as a thienyl or furyl,<br>
or an aryl group, such as a phenyl or a naphthyl; after reaction, the compound of<br>
formula (II), where R2 is as defined in the formula (I) and is other than hydrogen, is<br>
formed. The reaction can be carried out in an aprotic solvent, such as diethyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of<br>
between -70 and 100°C, to give the compound of formula (VI). The compounds of<br>
formula (II) can subsequently be obtained from the compounds of formula (VI), which<br>
are deprotected according to conditions known to a person skilled in the art. For<br>
example, the compounds of formula (VI), when Pg is a methyl group, can be<br>
deprotected in the presence of an acid, such as hydrobromic acid, in a protic solvent,<br>
such as water or acetic acid or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of<br>
between 0 and 100°C in the presence or absence of a phase transfer catalyst, such<br>
as an ammonium or phosphonium salt, to give the phenol of formula (II). Illustrations<br>
of the process are given in the examples.<br>
The starting compounds II and the amines of formula (III) are directly available<br>
commercially or can be synthesized by methods described such as beforehand, by<br>
conventional methods known to a person skilled in the art or are known in the<br>
literature.<br><br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject-matter of the invention is medicaments<br>
which comprise a compound of formula (I) or an addition salt of the latter with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid or also a hydrate or a solvate of the compound of<br>
formula (1).<br>
These compounds of the present invention are employed in therapeutics, in particular<br>
the treatment of disorders improved by modulation of the histamine H3 receptor and<br>
in the treatment of pathologies in which an antagonist of the histamine H3 receptor is<br>
of therapeutic benefit. Such pathologies are in particular obesity and diabetes.<br>
These compounds with properties as antagonist and inverse agonist of the histamine<br>
H3 receptor in the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system.<br>

the NMR, IR and mass spectra confirm the structures of the compounds obtained.<br>
In the table, for the compounds of formula (I), " M.p." corresponds to the melting<br>
point and " Config." indicates the stereochemical configuration, namely (R), (S) or a<br>
racemic mixture (R,S), of the carbon atom indicated by the asterix (*).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention of formula (I) have formed the subject of<br>
