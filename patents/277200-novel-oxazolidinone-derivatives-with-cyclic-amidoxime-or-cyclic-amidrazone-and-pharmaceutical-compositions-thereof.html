<br>
<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
<br>
?Technical Field?<br>
	The present invention relates to a novel oxazolidinone derivative represented by Chemical Formula 1, particularly to a novel oxazolidinone derivative having a cyclic amidoxime or a cyclic amidrazone group.<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br>
	 <br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical antibiotic composition comprising, as an effective ingredient, the novel oxazolidinone derivative, a prodrug thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof, an isomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
<br>
?Background Art?<br>
	Ever since the discovery of penicillin, numerous antibiotics have been developed by pharmaceutical companies worldwide, including ß-lactam antibiotics against bacterial infections, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, glycopeptides, and the like.  On the other hand, misuse or abuse of antibiotics incessantly created antibiotic resistant bacteria or multidrug resistant bacteria, which has been considered worldwide as a serious problem that has to be solved.  Indeed, a number of scientists in the international microbiological academic community warned that as the antibiotic resistance of such bacteria becomes high, new resistant bacteria that are not affected by any currently available antibiotics might be rampant in near future.<br>
In general, bacterial pathogens are classified into Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria.  Gram-positive bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus and acid-fast bacteria, once occurring in a hospital environment, tend to develop into antibiotic resistant bacteria that are difficult to be treated.  Examples of such antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacteria include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multiple-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or the like.<br>
Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is known to be clinically effective in treating such Gram-positive antibiotic resistant bacteria.  However, vancomycin has toxicity and, since the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in 1990s, bacteria resistant to vancomycin and other glycopeptide-based antibiotics are emerging.<br>
In addition, for antibiotics such as ß-lactam, quinolone and macrolide used to treat infections of upper respiratory tract caused by certain Gram-negative bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis), resistant bacteria such as quinoline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (QRSA) are emerging.  Hence, researches on new antibiotics are under way.<br>
Accordingly, in order to fundamentally solve the antibiotic resistance problem, development of antibiotics with new chemical structures and antibacterial mechanisms is urgently required.  As such an antibiotic with a new chemical structure, an oxazolidinone antibiotic was first reported by DuPont in 1984 (EP 127,902), after which a variety of oxazolidinone derivatives have been reported by many pharmaceutical companies.<br>
The oxazolidinone derivatives are obtained not by fermentation but by chemical synthesis and can be administered orally.  The chemical backbone of the oxazolidinone derivatives is totally different from that of the classical antibiotics.  It is reported that the oxazolidinone derivatives inhibit an initial stage of protein synthesis of bacteria and they exhibit superior antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (QRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB).<br>
One example of such oxazolidinone compounds containing an oxazolidinone ring is 3-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone derivatives having one or two substituent(s), as described in US Patent Nos. 4,948,801, 4,461,773, 4,340,606, 4,476,136, 4,250,318 and 4,128,654.  Another example is 3-[(mono-substituted)phenyl]-2-oxazolidinone derivatives represented by Chemical Formula A, as described in, e.g., EP 0312000, J. Med. Chem. 32, 1673(1989), J. Med. Chem. 33, 2569 (1990), Tetrahedron Lett. 45,123(1989).<br>
	[Chemical Formula A]<br>
	 <br>
Still another example is the compounds represented by Chemical Formula B and Chemical Formula C and synthesized by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, as described in WO 93/23384, WO 95/14684 and WO 95/07271.  The compound of Chemical Formula B, "linezolid", is the first commercially available oxazolidinone antibiotic and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and marketed under the trade name "Zyvox" for oral administration and injection.  However, these compounds have some problems such such as toxicity, low in vivo efficacy and low solubility.  As for linezolid, solubility in water is only about 3 mg/mL, which limits its practical use as an antibiotic for injection.<br>
	[Chemical Formula B]<br>
	 <br>
	[Chemical Formula C]<br>
	 <br>
Yet another example is phenyl oxazolidinone derivatives having a heterocyclic ring, such as, e.g., pyridine, thiazole, indole, oxazole, quinol, etc., at the 4-position of the phenyl group, as described in WO 93/09103.  But, the substituents of the heterocyclic ring are alkyl or amino group, and the pharmaceutical efficacy is not so excellent.<br>
Still yet another example is phenyl oxazolidinone derivatives having various pyridine or phenyl derivatives at the 4-position of the phenyl group, as described in WO 01/94342.  These compounds have wider antibacterial spectrum and better antibacterial activity than linezolid.  They, however, have aqueous solubility of 30 µg/mL or less, and thus it is virtually impossible to use them for injection.<br>
	A further example is the compounds (TR-700 and TR-701) represented by Chemical Formula D, which were developed by Dong-A Pharmaceutical (Korea) and recently licensed to Trius Therapeutics.  TR-701 is a prodrug of TR-700 and the phase III clinical trial is underway. TR-701 shows higher solubility and exhibits better antibacterial activity than linezolid.  However, it shows higher toxicities (cytotoxicity, MAO profile, myelosuppression, etc.) than linezolid, which may cause many limitations in practical use.<br>
	[Chemical Formula D]<br>
	 <br>
As described above, there is still a need for a compound having superior antibacterial activity, satisfactory solubility and lower toxicity.<br>
<br>
?Disclosure?<br>
?Technical Problem?<br>
The inventors of the present invention have synthesized novel oxazolidinone derivatives in order to provide antibiotics having superior antibacterial activity and having higher solubility suitable for oral or injection formulations, compared with existing antibiotics.  The novel oxazolidinone derivatives according to the present invention have been confirmed to have superior antibacterial activity for a significantly wide range of different types of bacteria.<br>
One of the features of the oxazolidinone derivative compounds provided by the present invention is that they have a cyclic amidoxime or cyclic amidrazone group.  While oxazolidinone derivative compounds having an acyclic amidoxime or amidrazone group were known, the oxazolidinone derivative compounds having a cyclic amidoxime or cyclic amidrazone group have not been known prior to the present invention .  As described in detain below, with the introduction of the cyclic amidoxime or cyclic amidrazone group, absorptivity is remarkably improved.  Also, solubility in water is greatly increased as a result of formation of a salt having an adequate basicity, thereby making it possible to prepare injection formulations without using a prodrug.  In addition, toxicity is significantly reduced.<br>
<br>
?Technical Solution?<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel oxazolidinone derivative, particularly a novel oxazolidinone compound with a cyclic amidoxime or a cyclic amidrazone group, which shows improved solubility, and a method for preparing the same.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical antibiotic composition comprising as an effective ingredient the novel oxazolidinone derivative, a prodrug thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof, an isomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The novel oxazolidinone derivative compounds and compositions according to the present invention can be used for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, socially acquired pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, or infections caused by antibiotic resistance bacteria, particularly septicemia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) or linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, or for combination therapy for Gram-negative bacteria-associated diseases.<br>

The oxazolidinone derivatives according to other embodiments of the present invention may include, but not limited to, the following compounds:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
   <br>
 .<br>
The oxazolidinone derivatives according to the above and other embodiments of the present invention, which have a cyclic amidoxime or a cyclic amidrazone group, can be used in a form of prodrug, hydrate, solvate, isomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof especially in case where such a form shows improved absorption into the body or enhanced solubility.  Accordingly, such a prodrug, hydrate, solvate, isomer, and pharmaceutically acceptable salt also fall within the scope of the present invention, as described below in detail.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" used herein includes an acid addition salt, examples of which include methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, succinate, hydrochloride, citrate, malate, tartrate and hydrobromide, phosphate, sulfate and the like.  Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be a basic salt including, e.g., an alkali metal salt (e.g., sodium salt) or an alkaline earth metal salt (e.g., calcium or magnesium salt), an organic amine salt (e.g., triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylethylamine and tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine), or an amino acid (e.g., N-methyl-D-glutamine and lysine).  The salt may include one or more cation(s) or anion(s) depending on the number of charged group(s) and the valence of the corresponding cation(s) or anion(s).  A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable basic salt is a sodium salt.  However, in order to facilitate release of salt during preparation, a salt less soluble in a selected solvent may be used.<br>
The oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention may be present either in a solvated form (e.g. as a hydrate) or in a non-solvated form.  The solvates of the oxazolidinone derivatives according to the present invention include all pharmaceutically active solvated forms.<br>
The oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention may be administered in a prodrug form, which is, once administered into a human or animal, is metabolized in vivo into one of the compounds of the present invention.  A prodrug may be formed by introducing an adequate group or substituent to a compound to modify or improve the physical and/or pharmacological profile of the compound.  A non-limiting example of the prodrug according to the present invention may be an ester of one of the compounds of the present invention that can be hydrolyzed in vivo or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Various types of prodrug forms and methods for preparing the prodrug forms are known in the related art, as described, e.g., in: a) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 42, p.309-396, edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic press, 1985); b) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 "Design and Application of Prodrugs", by H. Bundgaard p. 113-191 (1991); c) H. Bundgaard, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8, 1-38 (1992); d) H. Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77, 285 (1988); and e) N. Kakeya, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32, 692 (1984).<br>
Examples of the prodrug according to the present invention include the following compounds.<br>
 <br>
As in the foregoing examples, a phosphonate or acetyl group may be attached to the hydroxyl group, so that the prodrug is matabolized to an active form after administration.  Alternatively, an amino acid may be attached or a carbonate form may be prepared.  The prodrug form can be used especially when the solubility or absorptivity of the active form is relatively low.  The use of the prodrug may lead to the improvement of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and PK profile, in addition to the enhancement of solubility.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a chiral center at the C-5 position of the oxazolidinone ring.  Chemical Formula 1 above shows diastereomers of oxazolidinone derivative compounds of the present invention.  Chemical Formula 1b shows epimers of the oxazolidinone derivative compounds of Chemical Formula 1.  In general, compared to the epimers represented by Chemical Formula 1b, the oxazolidinone derivative compounds of Chemical Formula 1 exhibit better MAO profiles.<br>
	[Chemical Formula 1b]<br>
 <br>
Thus, in case where a mixture containing an oxazolidinone derivative (Chemical Formula 1a) and an epimer thereof (Chemical Formula 1b) is used as an antibiotic, it is preferable that the amount of the antibiotic may be controlled (increased) considering the proportion of the epimer of the mixture in order to attain a pharmacological effect substantially similar to or same as the pharmacological effect that can be attained when the oxazolidinone derivative (Chemical Formula 1a) is used alone. <br>
Further, some compounds of the present invention may have a different chiral center depending on their substituent(s).  All optical isomers, diastereomers and racemic mixtures having antibacterial activity are included in the scope of the present invention.  The method for preparing optically active forms (e.g., recrystallization, chiral synthesis, enzymatic resolution, biotransformation, or separation of racemic mixtures by chromatography) and methods for measurement of antibacterial activity are known in the related art.<br>
As the compounds represented by Chemical Formula 1 or the salts thereof may tautomerize, even though only one of possible tautomers is described in the chemical formulas or reaction schemes herein, the present invention encompasses all the tautomers having antibacterial activity and is not limited to the tautomer form(s) described in the chemical formulas or reaction schemes.<br>
Further, the compounds of the present invention may exhibit polymorphism.  Thus, all the polymorphic compounds having antibacterial activity are included in the present invention.<br>
The oxazolidinone derivatives according to the present invention may be prepared by known methods depending on their substituents.  For example, they may be prepared according to the methods exemplified by Schemes 1 to 6 below.  The preparation methods described in Schemes 1 to 6 are only exemplary and may be modified without extensive difficulty by those skilled in the art to prepare compounds having the other substituents.  Accordingly, methods for preparing the oxazolidinone compounds of the present invention should not be limited to the methods exemplified in Schemes 1 to 6.  Unless otherwise specified, the substituents in the reaction schemes below are defined in the same manner as those defined with respect to Chemical Formula 1.<br>
As discussed above, the oxazolidinone derivatives of Chemical Formula 1 according to the present invention may be synthesized via different synthetic routes, depending on the substituents, X1, X2, Y, P and Q.  Schemes 1 to 5 show examples of representative synthesis methods that can be used to prepare such derivatives in which either X1 or X2 is fluorine atom (F) and the other is hydrogen atom (H).  Scheme 6 shows examples of representative synthesis methods that can be used to prepare such derivatives in which both X1 and X2 are eithr H or F.<br>
Schemes 1-4 show examples of representative synthesis methods that can be used to prepare cyclic amidrazone compounds in which Y is nitrogen atom (N-R2) and P is –NH- (Schemes 1 and 2), an aromatic heterocycle (e.g., triazole) (Scheme 3), or -O- (Scheme 4).  Further, Scheme 5 shows examples of representative synthesis methods that can be used to prepare cyclic amidoxime compounds in which Y is –O-.<br>
More particularly, referring to Scheme 1, 3, 4-difluoronitrobenzene is reacted with ethanolamine to give Compound I.  After protecting the alcohol and amine groups with t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) respectively to give Compound II, the nitro group of the Compound II is reduced to amine using Pd/C to give Compound III.

After converting the azide group of Compound VII into amine using Pd/C under hydrogen gas, a cbz group is attached using Cbz-Cl to synthesize Compound VIII.  Compound VIII is treated with hydrochloric acid to remove the protecting groups (boc and tbs) to give Compound IX, which is reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride (Ms-Cl) to synthesize Compound X.  Compound X is reacted with hydrazine to produce Compoud XI, which is then reacted with trimethyl orthoformate to produce a cyclic amidrazone Compound XII.

Removal of the boc and tbs protecting groups using hydrochloric acid to give Compound XXIII.  Mesylation of Compound XXIII gives Compound XXIV, which is reacted with hydrazine to give Compound XXV with the benzoyl group removed.  Compound XXV is reacted with trimethyl orthoformate to synthesize a cyclic amidrazone compound.  After removing the formyl group, a variety of R2 groups are introduced.

	In Scheme 5(1), P and Q groups are introduced to Compound VI according to Schemes 1 to 4 to synthesize Compound XXVI, which is treated with hydrochloric acid to remove boc and tbs groups yielding Compound XXVII.  Compound XXVII is subjected to Mitsunobu condition with hydroxyphthalimide to obtain Compound XXVIII.  Removal of phthalimide using hydrazine followed by reaction with trimethyl orthoformate gives a cyclic amidoxime compound.<br>
	In Scheme 5(2), the alcohol group of oxazolidinone C-5 position is protected with benzoyl group to give Compound XXIII. Mitsunobu reaction with hydroxyphthalimide gives Compound XXIX.

	[Test Example 1] Measurement of in vitro antibacterial activity<br>
	In order to test the antibacterial activity of the oxazolidinone derivatives synthesized in Examples 1 to 107, in vitro activity test was carried out as follows.<br>
	In vitro antibacterial activity of the oxazolidinone derivatives of Examples 1 to 106 was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration 90 (MIC90; ug/mL).  The term MIC90 refers to the concentration of an antibiotic required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms such as bacteria subjected to the antibiotic, compared with the control group.  MIC90 measurement was made according to broth microdilution method based on the CLSI standard test [Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Document. (2000) Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically - Fifth Edition: M7-A5. CLSI, Villanova, PA].<br>
	1) Test bacteria<br>
14 bacterial species including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (LVRE), Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (S. aureus, S. aureusMR, S. epidermidis, S. epidermidisMR, E. faecalis, E. faecalisVanA, E. faecalisVanA LR, E. faeciumVanA, E. faecium, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis) were used to measure antibacterial activity of the oxazolidinone derivatives of Examples 1 to 107.  Table 1 shows MIC90 values for MRSA and LVRE, the most important two bacteria.<br>
	2) Preparation of test compounds<br>
	Test compounds (Compounds 1 to 106, i.e., the oxazolidinone derivatives synthesized in Examples 1 to 106) were dissolved in DMSO at the concentration of 10240 ug/mL and subjected to two-fold serial dilution with DMSO. The test compounds in DMSO solution were further diluted 20-fold with sterile distilled water. The final concentrations of the test compounds in antibacterial incubations were from 0.0625 to 128 ug/mL.  The final concentration of DMSO, which was used as an excipient, was 2.5% (v/v). Linezolid (Chemical Formula B) was used as a comparison compound.  Table 1 shows the respective antibacterial activities of the test compounds.<br>

 1. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus<br>
 2. vancomycin-linezolid resistant Enterococcus faecalis<br>
<br>
	As seen from Table 1, the oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention showed potent antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive bacteria resistant to existing antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, at much lower concentrations when compared to the comparison compound linezolid.  Although not shown in Table 1, they were also effective against various Gram-positive bacteria, including, e.g., Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis.  They also showed excellent antibacterial activity against linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that they can be used as an effective antibiotic against linezolid-resistant bacteria.<br>
	Accordingly, the oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention can be used as antibiotics having a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
<br>
	[Test Example 2] Measurement of aqueous solubility<br>
Water solubilities of methanesulfonates (MSA) of representative compounds (Examples 83, 89, and 94) among the oxazolidinone derivatives of Chemical Formula 1 were measured.  Linezolid of Chemical Formula B was used as a comparison compound.  The results are given in Table 2.<br>
	Solubility measurement was made by 1H NMR as follows. First, a methanesulfonate (100 mg) of each of the compounds was added to D2O (0.5 mL).  After preparing a saturated solution by vigorous shaking for 30 minutes, the solution was filtered and 0.3 mL was taken therefrom.  A reference compound solution (0.3 mL) (In this test example, DMSO diluted with D2O was used.) with an exactly known concentration was added thereto.  From the 1H NMR spectrum of the solution, the integral ratio of the sample peak to the reference (DMSO) peak was calculated.  The moles of the sample were calculated from the integral ratio.  Then, the solubility of the sample was calculated.	<br>
<br>
	[Table 2] Solubility of methanesulfonate in water<br>
Compound	Linezolid	83	89	94<br>
Solubility (mg/mL)<br>
(% solubility)	3<br>
(0.3%)	117<br>
(12%)	129<br>
(13%)	136<br>
(14%)<br>
<br>
	As seen from the table, the aqueous solubilities of the compounds represented by Chemical Formula 1 are greater than 10%, because the compounds can be prepared as salts.  In contrast, the aqueous solubility of the linezolid is only 0.3%.  That is to say, the aqueous solubilities of the compounds of the present invention are at least 50 times higher than that of linezolid.  This advantage allows the development of the compounds of the present invention into antibiotics that can be administered orally or intravenously as bolus, which is not feasible for linezolid.  Further, since they are effective against linezolid-resistant bacteria, as well as MRSA and VRE, they can be developed into outstanding antibiotics capable of replacing linezolid.<br>
<br>
	[Test Example 3] Cytotoxicity and Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)Inhibition<br>
1) Cytotoxicity measurement by MTT assay<br>
Cytotoxcicity was measured by MTT assay which is a qualitative, colorimetric assay that allows to assess mammalian cell survival and cell proliferation. The MTT assay measures cell respiration, using the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT) by the mitochondrial succinate dehrogenase of viable cells to form a blue formazan product, the amount of which is in a linear relationship with the number of living cells present in culture.  In this test, Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) purchased from ATCC (USA) were subcultured.  The subcultured CHO cells were separated from the culture flask by treating with trypsin-EDTA solution, and seeded on a 96-well microplate, with 5000 cells per each well.  After culturing for 24 hours in a 37oC, 5% CO2 incubator, the cells were treated with the oxazolidinone derivatives according to the present invention synthesized in the above Examples, at 7 different concentrations.  After further culturing for 48 hours in a 37oC, 5% CO2 incubator, 15uL of 5 ug/mL MTT solution was added to each well.  The cells were further incubated in the 37oC, 5% CO2 incubator for about 2 hours.  Then, the culture medium was discarded and 100 uL of DMSO solution was added to each well.  After agitating the microplate for 30 minutes, absorbance was measured at 550 nm using Spectramax plus 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).  The absorbance decrease of the compound-treated groups compared to the non-treated control group is an indication of the degree of the decrease of surviving cells, which enables the measurement of the cytotoxicity of the compounds.  The CC50 value, i.e., the concentration at which the cell proliferation is reduced to 50%, of the compounds according to the present invention was computed using the GraFit statistical analysis program (version 5.0.12) purchased from Erithacus Software after calculating the percentages of the absorbance at various concentrations as compared to the control group.<br>
2) MAO inhibition<br>
Linezolid is known to act as a nonselective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidases, and may possibly interact with adrenergic or serotonergic drugs.  The oxazolidinone derivatives according to the present invention synthesized in the Examples were tested for inhibition of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO B).  MAO-GLO assay kit was purchased from Promega (USA) and MAO A and MAO B enzymes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).  From the aldehyde product resulting from the action of the MAO enzyme on the amine group of the substrate, luciferin methyl ester is produced.  The luciferin detection reagent is then added to inactivate the MAO enzymes.  The esterase and the luciferase included in the reagent oxidize luciferin, thereby emitting light.  The light emission is detected to measure the activity of MAO.  The light emission was detected using LEADseeker (Amershan Bioscience, Sweden).  MAO activity was measured in the presence of the compounds according to the present invention at 3.9-500 uM and compared with the non-treated control group.  Linezolid was used as a comparison compound.  For the measurement of the MAO inhibition activity of the compounds represented by Chemical Formula 1, the IC50 value, i.e., the concentration of the compounds at which the enzymatic activity is inhibited by 50% (This value is related with the inhibition constant Ki), can be determined.  The concentration of the inhibitor at which the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate is reduced to 50% (i.e., the IC50 value) can be determined from a log plot of the relative rate of hydrolysis (as compared to the non-inhibited control group) versus the concentration of the compounds of Chemical Formula 1.<br>
The MAO inhibition effect of the compounds of Chemical Formula 1 was measured by determining the inhibition constant Ki.<br>
Equation 1<br>
Ki = IC50 / {1 + ([S]/Km)}<br>
In Equation 1, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, i.e., the concentration of the substrate at which the rate of enzymatic reaction is half of the maximum, and IC50 is the concentration of the inhibitor at which the rate of the hydrolysis of the substrate is reduced by 50%.  The IC50 value was measured by plotting a log plot of the relative rate of hydrolysis (as compared to the non-inhibited control group) versus the concentration of the compounds of Chemical Formula 1.  GraFit statistical analysis program (version 5.0.12) purchased from Erithacus Software was used.<br>
Cytotoxicity test and MAO inhibition test results for representative compounds among the oxazolidinone derivatives of Chemical Formula 1 are given in Table 3.<br>
Since the comparison compound linezolid exhibits significant inhibitory action against MAO enzymes and has the possibility of causing toxicity or other side effects, a lot of efforts have been made to find a compound with no MAO inhibition effect.  In general, oxazolidinone-based compounds show such a strong MAO inhibition effect as to be used as MAO inhibitors.  However, although the MAO inhibitor may provide a therapeutic effect for those who need it, it may result in toxicity or other side effects when it is used as an antibiotic.  Accordingly, the determination of the MAO inhibition effect of oxazolidinone antibiotics is important, and one with less such effect is favored.<br>
	Linezolid and TR-700 of Chemical Formula D, developed by Trius Therapeutics, were used as comparison compounds.  Since TR-701 is a prodrug of TR-700, TR-700 was used.<br>
<br>
	[Table 3] Cytotoxicity and MAO inhibition tests<br>

<br>
	As seen from the table 3, TR-700 exhibits substantial amount of cytotoxic effect and potent inhibitory effect against MAO A and MAO B as well .  In contrast, most of the compounds of the present invention are safe in terms of cytotoxicity and exhibit less inhibitory effect than TR-700 by 1/10.<br>
	Because the compounds of the present invention exhibit high solubility and good antibacterial activity with less toxicity, they are highly promising probable as next-generation antibiotics.<br>
While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.<br>
?Industrial Applicability?<br>
	As described above, the novel oxazolidinone derivatives of the present invention exhibit a wide antibacterial spectrum against existing antibiotic-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), a low toxicity, and a strong antibacterial activity against existing antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, especially an excellent antibacterial activity against linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.  Therefore, they can be used as the 2nd generation oxazolidinone antibiotics.  Further, the oxazolidinone derivatives with a cyclic amidoxime or cyclic amidrazone group according to the present invention can be easily formulated for oral administration or injection because they have higher solubility in water than other existing oxazolidinone compounds.<br>
