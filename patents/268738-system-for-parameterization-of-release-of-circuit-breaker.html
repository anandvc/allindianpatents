THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
NATURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
WIRELESS SMART CARD PARAMETERIZATION FOR THE RELEASE IN CIRCUIT BREAKER<br>
A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to circuit breakers and more particularly to the utilization of the smart cards in the protection and control unit of the circuit breakers.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A smart card is a device, typically about the same size as a credit card, that includes an embedded integrated circuit chip that stores and processes information. Information can be transferred between the smart card and an associated computing device such as a PC, a laptop computer or a handheld electronic device like a PDA, a two way pager, a cell phone or the like, through a reader device that is coupled to the associated computing device. In particular, the reader device is used to make an electrical connection to the integrated circuit of the smart card to provide a communication link between the smart card and the computing device.<br>
[0003] In the prior art, the reader devices have been physically coupled to the associated computing device, such as through a wire or some other physical connection. The physical connection provides a level of data security for the transfer of data between the<br>
3<br><br>
reader device and the smart card. Also, smarts cards are typically protected by an access control mechanism such as a password that must be provided in order the access the information stored on and the functionality provided by the integrated circuit chip of the smart card.<br>
[0004] Also usage of the above concept into the protection and control unit ("Protection and control unit is also called as "Release" of the circuit breakers) has recently been identified. Development of new "smart card technology" in circuit breakers will provide a significant increase in the level of security of data and onsite configuring releases over existing circuit breakers. The need for detecting passive failures and interrogating the circuit breaker for trip records and other advanced trouble shooting information without opening the circuit breaker panel is very desirable.<br>
[0005] In WO2006085190 patent to Eaton Corporation a system for monitoring a circuit breaker that includes a monitoring device in electronic communication with the circuit breaker and a receiving device located separately from the monitoring device is being disclosed. The monitoring device receives data from the circuit breaker and wirelessly transmits at least a portion of the data such as one or more phase currents measured from a network that the circuit breaker protects, an ambient temperature within the circuit breaker, and/or data to a trip condition of the circuit breaker. The receiving device receives the transmitted data and displays all or a portion thereof. The monitoring device also includes a display that displays all or a portion of the data.<br>
4<br><br>
[0006] Even if the improvement is significant but there are a couple of drawbacks associated with the above WO patent like there is usage of smart cards into the same, so the main issue that arises here is the compatibility and security of the communicating data. Data collection from the circuit breaker is not possible. Eaton Corporation's system is just a monitoring system. The system is not meant for configuration. With existing patent, only data viewing from contact-less device is possible. Online configuration in release is not possible. Its one way communication where in smart card technology ,one can take out data to viewing and analysis purpose and also one can download configuration settings using smart card. Such a situation is unacceptable and accordingly needs an improvement.<br>
[0007] Hence therefore an object of the present invention is to at least remove one of the above-mentioned drawbacks and develop a wireless smart card parameterization system for the release in circuit breaker.<br>
C) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present invention relates to a system for the usage of smart card in parameterization of the release in the circuit breakers. Apart from being used to parameterize the release of the circuit breaker, the present invention may also be used to authenticate the card user's identity. Various parameter settings may be fed from the smart card to release that is already written on the smart card. Using this data retrieval of<br>
5<br><br>
the data from the release like existing settings for verification purpose, trip records, trip events and timing etc. can be done.<br>
[0009] Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention describes a system for parameterization of a release in accordance with a prestored parameterizing data in a circuit breaker. The system comprises of a smart card having the prestored parameterizing data and a smart card module interface configured with the smart card for receiving the smart card therein. Further, a smart card reader module is connected with the smart card module interface and a release wherein the reader provides a communication interface between the smart card and the release so as to enable transaction of the prestored parameterizing data to the release. The smart card reader module is configured with the release via a CAN Bus or a CAN interface.<br>
[0010] According to one embodiment of the present invention the communication interface between the reader and the smart card is carried out by a wireless means wherein a chip containing a RF transceiver effectively communicates with the reader having an antenna therein.<br>
[0011] According to one embodiment of the present invention a smart card personalizer provides a communication interface between the smart card and a multimedia means thereby allowing the prestored parameterizing data to be stored on the smart card. The<br>
6<br><br>
communication interface between the smart card and the smart card personalizer is through wireless.<br>
[0012] Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the drawings, and from the detailed description that follows below.<br>
D) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] Reference will be made to embodiments of the invention, examples of which may be illustrated in the accompanying figures. These figures are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Although the invention is generally described in the context of these embodiments, it should be understood that it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to these particular embodiments.<br>
[0014] FIGURE.l illustrates the various communication interfaces of the parameterization system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0015] FIGURE.2 shows the communication interface of the smart card personalizer with the multimedia and the smart card according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
7<br><br>
E) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016] Now reference herein is being given to one of the embodiments of the present invention that in conjugation with the Figure. 1 explains the working principle of the smart card parameterization of the release 10 of the circuit breaker. A system for parameterization of a release 10 in accordance with a prestored parameterizing data in a circuit breaker, the system comprising a smart card 12 having the prestored parameterizing data and a smart card module 14 configured with the smart card 12 for receiving the smart card 12 therein. A smart card reader 16 module configured with the smart card module 14 and a release 10, wherein the reader provides a communication interface between the smart card 12 and the release 10 so as to enable transaction of the prestored parameterizing data to the release 10.<br>
[0017]The following description is set forth for purpose of explanation in order to provide an understanding of the invention. However, it is apparent that one skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of the present invention, some of which are described below, may be incorporated into a number of different computing systems and devices. The embodiments of the present invention may be present in hardware, software or firmware. Structures shown below in the diagram are illustrative of exemplary embodiments of the invention and are meant to avoid obscuring the invention. Furthermore, arrangements of components within the figures are not intended to be limited.<br>
8<br><br>
[0018] Reference in the specification to "one embodiment", "in one embodiment" or "an embodiment" etc. means that a particular feature, structure, characteristic, or function described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.<br>
[0019] The parameterizing data written on the smart card 12 is inserted in to the smart card module, which in turn is configured to the release 10 via smart card module. The parameterization data may pertain to data retrieval of the data from the release 10 like existing settings for verification purpose, trip records, trip events and timing or the like. Normally the smart card 12 includes a micro controller 22, memory having the parameterizing data, a secure communication bus and a power circuit embedded therein. The smart card module 14 interacts with the release 10 via smart card reader 16, wherein the smart card module 14 interfaces with the smart card reader 16 using a free scale micro controller 22.<br>
[0020] After the smart card 12 is being inserted in the smart card module, data on the smart card 12 is transferred to the release 10 via smart card reader. Smart card reader 16 is configured to the smart card module 14 for enabling the data to be transferred and received by the reader for further prosecution of the same to the release 10. The reader senses the parameterizing data and transfers it further to the release 10 to which it is<br>
9<br><br>
configured by a CAN interface or more particularly by a CAN Bus 18. It must quite apparent for any skilled person to understand the functioning of the CAN Bus 18 in the data communication. Here it may be observed that there is a provision of display on the release 10 and among which there is a menu that guides the user to navigate on to the smart card 12 screen and upload the necessary parameterizing data on the release 10, according to which the release 10 will function later on. Each of the circuit breaker has a main release 10 which would be hereinafter in the foregoing description would be referred to as release 10. Alternatively it must be noted that the various important data for example history of the circuit breaker setting and configuration may also be uploaded on the smart card 12 with he help of list of options available on the display screen.<br>
[0021] There are two LEDs, tri-color led and red LED and one push button switch. Push button is for self test of reader. In tri color led, amber color is for 'Self Test Pass', red for "self Test Fail' and green for 'Power ON' indication. Red LED is used for tag detection and for communication indication. Whenever card is inserted in smart card reader, it glows and when communication between smart card 12 and release 10 starts, its starts blinking.<br>
[0022] It must be appreciated that this embodiment provides both read and write functions of the parameterizing data on the smart card. Among variety of options present on the display screen of the release 10 there is an option "read from card", and as the name illustrates it refers to reading of the data present on the smart card. Normally data<br>
10<br><br>
present on the card is in the form of files. So, therefore the files present on the smart card 12 would be reflected on the display by using this option. Another option available read as "write to card" refers to write the data files of the release 10 on the smart card 12that can then be viewed in any of the multimedia 26 devices. Further, a maximum of two files may be stored on the smart card 12 either it is prestored or written from the release 10.<br>
[0023] Among other options available are like "delete files" and "format card". The option delete files is self-explanatory while the other one refers to formatting of the smart card. By doing so all the files from the smart card 12 are deleted and is again put in to reuse. Thus it must be quite understandable that such kinds of smart gave got the advantage of reusability.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention the communication interface between the reader and the smart card 12 is carried out by a wireless means wherein a chip containing a RF transceiver effectively communicates with the reader having an antenna 20 therein. Further, in present invention wireless smart card, in which the chip communicates with the card reader through RFID 30 induction technology at data rates of 106 kbit/s. The chip contains a transceiver that actually communicates with the antenna 20 of the reader. These cards require only close proximity to an antenna 20 to complete transaction. Contact less cards are powered by a Radio Frequency signal and don't require insertion into a reader.<br>
Card just has to be passed near an antenna 20 for the transaction to be carried out. The reading distance is up to 5 cms. The wireless transceiver module transmits signals<br>
11<br><br>
received from the processor unit and receives a wirelessly transmitted power signal. The power circuit generates at least one supply voltage from the received power signal and provides the supply voltage to the sensor module. As there is no contact, these cards solve most of the limitations under the contact cards like contacts get worn out, electrostatic discharges, due to improper contact damages in the circuits.<br>
[0024] A comfortable parallel interface that can be directly connected to any 16-bit microcontroller gives high flexibility for reader/terminal design. These smart cards hold data. This allows the card-transaction participants (card Design Company, users, service person etc.) to store a various parameters configuration, settings and additional information on the card.<br>
[0025] A very important advantage of the present invention is that the main application of smart card 12 here is to upload/ download of configuration settings in main release 10. Using smart card, user or service engineer can download all settings (more than 100 settings) in all release 10 on site. It will not only save the time of manual insertion (one by one setting in release 10) but also the human error (which is possible while entering data in many release 10s.)<br>
[0026] According to one embodiment of the present invention and as referred to in Figure 2 a smart card 12 personalizer 24 provides a communication interface between the smart card 12 and a multimedia 26 means thereby allowing the prestored parameterizing data to<br>
12<br><br>
be stored on the smart card. The communication interface between the smart card 12and the smart card 12 personalizer 24 is through wireless. The multimedia 26 means could be anything like a PC, mobile, a PDA or any communicating device. The parameterizing data is stored on the smart card 12 from the multimedia 26 through the smart card personalizer 24 wirelessly, which is further executed to the release 10. The smart card personalizer 24 comprises a micro controller 22, a transceiver and an antenna 20 operatively connected in tandem to enable the necessary parameterizing data from the multimedia 26 to capture by the transceiver of the smart card. Preferably, the multimedia 26 is connected to the smart card personalizer 24 via RS-32 cable.<br>
[0027] According to another embodiment of the present invention the smart card 12 could also be used for the user authentication procedure which may involve the following steps like: Every card will be programmed in factory with a predefined authentication key. Every time a card is inserted inside smart card module 14 or personalizer 24, it checks for authentication key. If authentication key is not found in the card it is declared as an invalid card and user is not allowed to use it. There will also be password-based authentication available for files on main release 10 and PCHMI.<br>
[0028] In the light of the aforementioned description it would be quite apparent to understand that the present system of parameterization of the release 10 of the circuit breaker and the smart card 12 itself gives various advantages like data on a smart card 12 can be protected against unauthorized viewing. As a result of this, confidential data can<br>
13<br><br>
be stored on a smart card. A single smart card 12 can house multiple applications like exchange of the critical data from main release 10 system to card and vice versa. Life of a smart card 12 is longer. Smart cards cannot be easily replicated and are, as a general rule much more secures that magnetic stripe cards.<br>
[0029] The foregoing description of the invention has been described for purposes of clarity and understanding. It is not intended to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Various modifications may be possible within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims.<br>
