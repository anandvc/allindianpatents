				<td>POLYCONDENSATION CATALYST FOR POLYESTER PRODUCTION<br>
AND PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to polycondensation catalysts<br>
for producing polyester and to methods producing polyester using<br>
such polycondensation catalysts.<br>
Background Art<br>
Polyesters typified by polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate excel in<br>
mechanical properties and chemical properties and are used in a<br>
wide variety of fields including fibers for clothes and industrial<br>
materials, films or sheets for packaging materials or magnetic<br>
tapes, bottles, which are hollow molded articles, casings of electric<br>
or electronic appliances, and other types of molded articles or<br>
components.<br>
Certain representative polyesters, namely, polyesters<br>
composed of aromatic dicarboxylic acid components and alkylene<br>
glycol components as major constituents, such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, are produced by first preparing<br>
bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) and an oligomer<br>
containing the same by an esterification reaction between<br>
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol or transesterification of<br>
dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol, and then subjecting<br>
them to melt-polycondensation in vacuo at high temperatures in the<br>
presence of a polycondensation catalyst.<br>
As such a polycondensation catalyst for producing polyester,<br>
antimony trioxide is heretofore widely used as disclosed in JP<br>
46-3395 B. Antimony trioxide is a catalyst which is inexpensive<br><br>
and is of excellent catalytic activities, however, it has some<br>
problems. For example, antimony metal is formed while it is used<br>
in polycondensation thereby making the resulting polyester<br>
darkened, or the resulting polyester is contaminated with foreign<br>
substances. In addition, antimony trioxide is inherently<br>
poisonous. In recent years, therefore, development of catalysts<br>
free of antimony has been awaited.<br>
For example, a catalyst composed of a germanium compound<br>
is known as a catalyst which has an excellent catalytic activity and<br>
which can provide polyester excellent in hue and thermal stability.<br>
This catalyst, however, is problematic in that it is very expensive<br>
and that the catalyst content in a reaction system changes with<br>
time and it becomes difficult to control the polymerization because<br>
the catalyst is easily distilled off from the reaction system during<br>
the polymerization.<br>
On the other hand, as disclosed in JP 463395 B and JP<br>
49-57092 A, it is already known that titanium compounds such as<br>
glycol titanate and titanium alkoxide also can be used as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst for producing polyester by<br>
transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol.<br>
For example, according to U.S. Patent No. 5596069,<br>
polycondensation catalysts comprising tetraalkoxy titanate are<br>
known. They, however, have problems in that the resulting<br>
polyester is liable to be colored due to thermal degradation during<br>
the melt-molding thereof.<br>
In recent years, many methods for producing high-quality<br>
polyester at high productivity using a titanium compound as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst have been proposed. For example, as<br>
disclosed in JP 2001-064377 A and JP 2001-114885 A, a solid<br>
titanium compound obtained by first preparing a hydroxide of<br>
titanium by hydrolysis of titanium halide or titanium alkoxide and<br>
then dehydrating and drying the hydroxide by heating it at a<br>
temperature of from 30 to 350Â°C has been proposed as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst.<br>
Some of the heretofore known polycondensation catalysts<br><br>
composed of titanic acid, including the above-mentioned titanium<br>
compounds, have high polymerization activities per unit weight of<br>
metal. However, in many cases, there is a tendency that such a<br>
catalyst exhibits a high polymerization activity, but the resulting<br>
polyester is liable to be colored due to thermal degradation during<br>
its melt-molding. There is also a tendency that the resulting<br>
polyester is poor in transparency.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied in order to<br>
solve the above-mentioned problems involved in the conventional<br>
polycondensation catalysts for producing polyester. As a result,<br>
they have reached the present invention by finding that when a coat<br>
layer of titanic acid is formed on the surface of solid base particles<br>
and such a product is used as a polycondensation catalyst for<br>
producing polyester, decomposition of polyester is controlled during<br>
the production of polyester and high-molecular-weight polyester is<br>
formed at a high polymerization activity and the polyester hardly<br>
suffers coloring due to thermal degradation during its<br>
melt-molding.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a novel<br>
polycondensation catalyst for producing polyester which exhibit<br>
high catalytic activities and provide polyester with excellent hue or<br>
color tone and transparency even in the absence of antimony. It is<br>
also an object of the invention to provide a method for producing<br>
polyester using such a polycondensation catalyst.<br>
The invention provides a polycondensation catalyst for<br>
producing polyester by an esterification reaction or<br>
transesterification reaction between a dicarboxylic acid or<br>
ester-forming derivative thereof and glycol, wherein the<br>
polycondensation catalyst comprises particles of solid base having<br>
on their surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid in an amount of from<br>
0.1 to 50 parts by weight in terms of TiO2 per 100 parts of the solid<br>
base.<br><br>
The polyeondensation catalyst is obtainable by adding an<br>
aqueous solution of titanium halide and an aqueous alkaline<br>
solution to an aqueous slurry of particles of a solid base at a<br>
temperature of from 25 to 40Â°C so that the aqueous slurry has a pH<br>
of 5 to 12, thereby forming a surface coat comprising titanic acid on<br>
the surface of the particles of the solid base, drying the particles of<br>
the solid base with the surface coat, and pulverizing the particles.<br>
The invention further provides a polyeondensation catalyst<br>
for producing polyester by an esterification reaction or<br>
transesterification reaction between a dicarboxylic acid or an<br>
ester-forming derivative thereof and a glycol, wherein the<br>
polyeondensation catalyst comprises particles of a solid base having<br>

aluminum and zirconium in an amount of from 1 to 20 parts by<br>
weight per 100 parts by weight of the solid base, and an outer coat<br>

Among the above-mentioned catalysts, a catalyst having an<br>
inner coat layer of an oxide of at least one element selected from<br>
silicon and aluminum or a composite oxide of silicon and aluminum<br>
and an outer coat layer of titanic acid on the surface of the particles<br>
of the solid base is obtainable by, while maintaining an aqueous<br>

parts by weight of the solid base and/or a water-soluble aluminate<br>
in an amount of from 1 to 20 parts by weight in terms of AI2O3 per<br>
100 parts by weight of the solid base and an acid, thereby forming<br>
an inner coat layer of an oxide of at least one element selected from<br>
silicon and aluminum or a composite oxide of silicon and aluminum<br>
on the surface of the particles of the solid base; adding an aqueous<br>
solution of titanium halide and an aqueous alkaline solution to the<br>
resulting aqueous slurry of the particles of the solid base at a<br><br>
temperature of from 25 to 40Â°C so that the aqueous slurry has a<br>
pH of 5 to 12, thereby forming an outer coat layer of titanic acid on<br>
the inner coat layer; and drying and pulverizing the particles of the<br>
solid base with the inner and outer coat layers.<br>
Among the above-mentioned catalysts, a catalyst having an<br>
inner coat layer of an oxide of zirconium and an outer coat layer of<br>
titanic acid on the surface of the particles of the solid base is<br>
obtainable by, while maintaining an aqueous slurry of the particles<br>
of the solid base at a temperature of from 5 to 100Â°C, adding to the<br>
aqueous slurry a water-soluble zirconium salt in an amount of from<br>
1 to 20 parts by weight in terms of ZrO2 per 100 parts by weight of<br>
the solid base and an alkali, thereby forming an inner coat layer of<br>
an oxide of zirconium on the surface of the particles of the solid<br>
base; adding an aqueous solution of titanium halide and an aqueous<br>
alkaline solution to the resulting aqueous slurry of the particles of<br>
the solid base at a temperature of from 25 to 40Â°C so that the<br>
aqueous slurry has a pH of 5 to 12, thereby forming an outer coat<br>
layer of titanic acid on the inner coat layer; and drying and<br>
pulverizing the particles of the solid base with the inner and outer<br>
coat layers.<br>
Among the above-mentioned catalysts, a catalyst having an<br>

element selected from silicon and aluminum and an outer coat layer<br>
of titanic acid on the surface of the particles of the solid base is<br>

alkaline solution to the resulting aqueous slurry of the particles of<br>

layer of titanic acid on the inner coat layer; and drying and<br>
pulverizing the particles of the solid base with the inner and outer<br>
coat layers.<br>
According to the invention, the solid base in the<br>
polycondensation catalysts mentioned above is preferably<br>
magnesium hydroxide or hydrotalcite.<br>
The invention further provides a method for producing<br>
polyester comprising subjecting a dicarboxylic acid or an<br>
ester-forming derivative thereof and a glycol to an esterification<br>
reaction or a transesterification reaction in the presence of such a<br>

In particular, the invention provides, as a preferred<br>
embodiment, a method for producing polyester comprising<br>
preparing an oligomer comprising a bis(hydroxyalkyl) ester of an<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acid by an esterification reaction or a<br>
transesterification reaction of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid or an<br>
ester-forming derivative thereof and an alkylene glycol, and<br>
subsequently melt-polycondensing the oligomer under a high<br>
vacuum at a high temperature in the presence of such a<br>
polycondensation catalyst mentioned above.<br>
Furthermore, the titanium halide used in the preparation of<br>
the polycondensation catalyst according to the invention mentioned<br>
above is preferably titanium tetrachloride.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A first polycondensation catalyst for producing polyester by<br>
an esterification reaction or transesterification reaction between a<br>
dicarboxylic acid or an ester-forming derivative thereof and a glycol<br>
according to the invention is such that it comprises particles of a<br>
solid base having on their surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid in an<br><br>
amount of from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight in terms of TiO2 per 100<br>
parts of the solid base.<br>
A second polycondensation catalyst for producing polyester<br>
by an esterification reaction or transesterification reaction<br>
between a dicarboxylic acid or an ester-forming derivative thereof<br>
and a glycol according to the invention is such that it comprises<br>
particles of a solid base having on their surfaces an inner coat layer<br>
of an oxide of at least one element selected from silicon, aluminum<br>
and zirconium or a composite oxide of at least two elements selected<br>
from silicon, aluminum and zirconium in an amount of from 1 to 20<br>
parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the solid base and an<br>
outer coat layer of titanic acid in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 parts<br>
by weight in terms of TiO2 per 100 parts of the solid base.<br>
In the invention, examples of the solid base include oxides,<br>
hydroxides or various composite oxides of alkali metals or alkaline<br>
earth metals, and oxides or composite oxides of aluminum, zinc,<br>
lanthanum, zirconium, thorium and the like. Such oxides and<br>
composite oxides may be replaced partially by salts such as<br>
carbonates. Therefore, in the invention, more specific examples of<br>
the solid base include oxides and hydroxides of magnesium, calcium,<br>
strontium, barium, aluminum, zinc and the like, e.g., magnesium<br>
hydroxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, barium oxide, zinc oxide<br>
and the like, and composite oxides such as hydrotalcite. In<br>
particular, magnesium hydroxide or hydrotalcite is preferably used<br>
according to the invention as a solid base.<br>
In the invention, titanic acid is a hydrated titanium oxide<br>
represented by the general formula<br>
TiO2 â¢ nH20<br>
wherein n is a number satisfying 0 
be obtained, for example, by alkaline hydrolysis of a certain kind of<br>
titanium compound as described later.<br>
First, the first polycondensation catalyst according to the<br>
invention is described. In the first polycondensation catalyst<br>
according to the invention, when the amount of the coat layer of<br>
titanic acid is less than 0.1 parts by weight in terms of TiO2, per<br><br>
100 parts by weight of the solid base, the resulting<br>
polycondensation catalyst exhibits a low polymerization activity<br>
and fails to provide high-molecular-weight polyester with<br>
satisfactory productivity. On the other hand, when the amount of<br>
the coat layer of titanic acid is more than 50 parts by weight in<br>
terms of TiO2, per 100 parts by weight of the solid base,<br>
decomposition of polyester occurs easily during the production of<br>
the polyester and coloring of the resulting polyester due to its<br>
thermal degradation occurs easily during the melt-molding of the<br>
polyester.<br>
Such a first polycondensation catalyst according to the<br>
invention can be obtained by, while maintaining an aqueous slurry<br>
of the particles of a solid base at a temperature of from 5 to 100Â°C,<br>
preferably from 25 to 40Â°C, adding to the aqueous slurry a titanium<br>
compound in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight in terms of<br>
TiO2 per 100 parts by weight of the solid base, and then adding an<br>
alkali to the resulting mixture to hydrolyze the titanium compound<br>
at a pH of 5 to 12, preferably at a pH of 7 to 10, thereby forming a<br>
coat layer of titanic acid, and then drying and pulverizing the<br>
particles of the solid base with the coat layer. The temperature for<br>
the drying is preferably within the range of from 60 to 180oC, and<br>
particularly preferably within the range of from 100 to 130Â°C.<br>
The first polycondensation catalyst according to the<br>
invention can also be obtained by another method. It can be<br>
obtained by, while maintaining an aqueous slurry of a solid base at<br>
a temperature of from 5 to 100Â°C, preferably from 25 to 40Â°C,<br>
adding to the aqueous slurry a titanium compound in an amount of<br>
from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight in terms of TiO2 per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the solid base and an alkali in an amount almost<br>
equivalent to that of the titanium compound, and if needed, adding<br>
additional alkali to hydrolyze the titanium compound at a pH of 5 to<br>
12, preferably at a pH of 7 to 10, thereby forming a coat layer of<br>
titanic acid, and then drying at a temperature from 60 to 180Â°C and<br>
pulverizing the particles of the solid base with the coat layer.<br>
In the preparation of the polycondensation catalyst of the<br><br>
invention, examples of the titanic compound which can form a<br>
titanic acid coat by the alkaline hydrolysis include titanium halides<br>
such as titanium tetrachloride, titanates such as titanylammonium<br>
oxalate, and titanium alkoxides such as titanium tetraisopropoxide.<br>
The titanic compound, however, is not limited to these examples.<br>
Examples of the alkali used for the hydrolysis include ammonia and<br>
sodium hydroxide, but the alkali also is not limited to these<br>
examples.<br>
In the first polycondensation catalyst according to the<br>
invention, the solid base is preferably magnesium hydroxide or<br>
hydrotalcite. Therefore, one of the preferred first<br>
polycondensation catalysts according to the invention is such that<br>
it comprises magnesium hydroxide particles having on their<br>
surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid in an amount of from 0.1 to 50<br>
parts by weight in terms of TiO2 per 100 parts by weight of<br>
magnesium hydroxide. Another one of the preferred first<br>
polycondensation catalysts according to the invention is such that<br>
it comprises hydrotalcite particles having on their surfaces a coat<br>
layer of titanic acid in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight<br>
in terms of TiO2 per 100 parts by weight of hydrotalcite.<br>
The slurry of the magnesium hydroxide used for the<br>
preparation of the polycondensation catalyst comprising<br>
magnesium hydroxide particles having on their surfaces a coat<br>
layer of titanic acid among the preferred first polycondensation<br>
catalysts mentioned above refers to, for example, a slurry obtained<br>
by neutralizing an aqueous solution of a water-soluble magnesium<br>
salt such as magnesium chloride and magnesium nitrate with an<br>
alkali such as sodium hydroxide and ammonia to precipitate<br>
magnesium hydroxide, or a slurry obtained by dispersing<br>
magnesium hydroxide particles in an aqueous medium. When an<br>
aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide is obtained by neutralizing<br>
an aqueous solution of a water-soluble magnesium salt with an<br>
alkali, the aqueous solution of the water-soluble magnesium salt<br>
and the alkali may be subjected to simultaneous neutralization or<br>
alternatively neutralization may be conducted by adding one to the<br><br>
other.<br>
The above-mentioned magnesium hydroxide particles may be<br>
derived from any source. For example, they may be powder<br>
obtained by pulverizing natural ore or powder obtained by<br>
neutralizing an aqueous magnesium salt solution with an alkali.<br>
The hydrotalcite used for the preparation of the<br>
polycondensation catalyst comprising hydrotalcite particles having<br>
on their surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid among the preferred<br>
first polycondensation catalysts is preferably represented by the<br>
following general formula (I):<br>
M2+i-xM3+x(OH)2Anx/n â¢ mH2O â¢ â¢ â¢ (I)<br>
wherein M2+ denotes at least one divalent metal ion selected from<br>
Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+; M3+ denotes at least one trivalent metal ion<br>
selected from Al3+, Fe3+ and Ti3+; An" denotes at least one anion<br>
selected from SO42', CT, CO32' and OH'J n denotes the valence of the<br>
anion; x is a number satisfying 0 
satisfying 0 
In particular, in the invention, a hydrotalcite in which M2+ is<br>
Mg2+, M3+ is Al3+ and An" is CO32 , i.e., one represented by the<br>
general formula (II) is preferably used-<br>
Mg2+i-xAl3+x(OH)2(CO32)x/2 â¢ mH20 â¢ â¢ â¢ (II)<br>
wherein x and m have meanings the same as those mentioned above.<br>
Although such a hydrotalcite can be obtained easily as a product in<br>
the market, it can also be produced, if necessary, by a<br>
conventionally known method, e.g. a hydrothermal method, using<br>
proper materials.<br>
In the invention, for example, the aqueous slurry of<br>
magnesium hydroxide or hydrotalcite means an aqueous solution in<br>
which the dispersion medium of the slurry is water or an aqueous<br>
solution containing a small amount of water-soluble organic<br>
solvent; the aqueous solution means an aqueous solution in which<br>
the solvent of the solution is water or an aqueous solution<br>
containing a small amount of water-soluble organic solvent; and the<br>
aqueous medium means water or an aqueous solution containing a<br>
small amount of water-soluble organic solvent.<br><br>
In the invention, the aqueous slurry of hydrotalcite means a<br>
slurry obtained by dispersing the aforementioned hydrotalcite in<br>
the aforementioned aqueous medium.<br>
Next, the second polycondensation catalyst according to the<br>
invention is described. In the second polycondensation catalyst<br>
according to the invention, when the amount of the inner coat layer<br>
of an oxide of at least one element selected from silicon, aluminum<br>
and zirconium or a composite oxide of at least two elements selected<br>
from silicon, aluminum and zirconium is less than 1 part by weight<br>
per 100 parts by weight of the solid base, the resulting<br>
polycondensation catalyst has a high polymerization activity, but<br>
the hue of the resulting polyester is not improved. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of the inner coat layer is more than 20 parts<br>
by weight in terms of an oxide per 100 parts by weight of the solid<br>
base, the polymerization activity of the resulting polycondensation<br>
catalyst decreases undesirably.<br>
When the amount of the outer coat layer of titanic acid is<br>
less than 0.1 parts by weight in terms of TiO2, per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the solid base, the resulting polycondensation catalyst<br>
exhibits a low polymerization activity and fails to provide<br>
high-molecular-weight polyester with satisfactory productivity.<br>
On the other hand, when the amount of the outer coat layer of<br>
titanic acid is more than 50 parts by weight in terms of TiO2, per<br>
100 parts by weight of the solid base, decomposition of polyester<br>
occurs easily during the production of the polyester and coloration<br>
of the resulting polyester due to its thermal degradation occurs<br>
easily during the melt-molding of the polyester.<br>

the invention, a polycondensation catalyst having an inner coat<br>
layer of an oxide of at least one element selected from silicon and<br>
aluminum or a composite oxide of silicon and aluminum on the<br>

thereby forming an outer coat layer of titanic acid on the inner coat<br>
layer, and then drying and pulverizing the particles of the solid<br>
base having the inner coat layer and the outer coat layer.<br>
A polycondensation catalyst having an inner coat layer of a<br>

the slurry so that it has a pH of 7 to 12, preferably a pH of 8 to 9,<br>
and washing with water, thereby forming an inner coat layer of a<br>
zirconium oxide on the surface of the particles of the solid base;<br>
then, treating the thus obtained aqueous slurry of the particles of<br>

outer coat layer of titanic acid on the inner coat layer; and drying<br>
and pulverizing the slurry.<br><br>
Further, a polycondensation catalyst having an inner coat<br>

The method for producing polyester according to the<br>
invention comprises subjecting a dicarboxylic acid or an<br>
ester-forming derivative thereof and a glycol to an esterification<br>
reaction or a transesterification reaction in the presence of the first<br>
or second polycondensation catalysts described above.<br>
In the invention, examples of the dicarboxylic acid include<br>
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids exemplified by succinic acid, glutaric<br>
acid, adipic acid and dodecanedicarboxylic acid and their<br>
ester-forming derivatives such as dialkyl esters; and aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids exemplified by terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid<br><br>
and naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and their ester-forming<br>
derivatives such as dialkyl esters. In the present invention,<br>
examples of the glycol include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, butylene glycol and<br>
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.<br>
Among the examples provided above, for example, aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and<br>
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid are preferably used as the<br>
dicarboxylic acid; and alkylene glycols such as ethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol and butylene glycol are preferably used as the<br>
glycol.<br>
Therefore, in the invention, specific examples of preferred<br>
polyesters include polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene<br>
terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate, polyethylene<br>
naphthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, polypropylene naphthalate<br>
and poly(l,4-cyclohexane dimethylene terephthalate).<br>
In the present invention, however, the neither dicarboxylic<br>
acid or its ester-forming derivative nor the glycol or its<br>
ester-forming derivative is limited to the examples listed above.<br>
Further, the resulting polyester is not limited to the examples<br>
shown above.<br>
In general, polyester represented by polyethylene<br>
terephthalate has been produced by any of the following methods: a<br>
method comprising producing a low-molecular-weight oligomer<br>
containing the aforementioned BHET by a direct esterification of a<br>
dicarboxylic acid represented by terephthalic acid and a glycol<br>
represented by ethylene glycol, and subjecting the oligomer to<br>
melt-polycondensation in the presence of a polycondensation<br>
catalyst under a high vacuum at a high temperature to yield<br>
polyester with a desired molecular weight; and a method<br>
comprising producing, like the foregoing method, a<br>
low-molecular-weight oligomer containing the aforementioned<br>
BHET by a transesterification of a dialkyl terephthalate<br>
represented by dimethyl terephthalate and a glycol represented by<br>
ethylene glycol, and subjecting the oligomer to<br><br>
melt-polycondensation in the presence of a polycondensation<br>
catalyst under a high vacuum at a high temperature to yield<br>
polyester with a desired molecular weight.<br>
Also in the invention, polyester having a desired molecular<br>
weight can be obtained by producing a low-molecular-weight<br>
oligomer containing the foregoing BHET by the above-mentioned<br>
direct esterification reaction or transesterification reaction, and<br>
then subjecting the oligomer to melt-polycondensation in the<br>
presence of the first or the second polycondensation catalyst of the<br>
invention under a high vacuum at a high temperature in the<br>
conventionally known manner as described above.<br>
For example, polyethylene terephthalate is produced as<br>
follows. In accordance with an ordinary method, as conventionally<br>
known, a low-molecular-weight oligomer containing BHET can be<br>
obtained by feeding dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol<br>
together with a catalyst such as calcium acetate into a reactor,<br>
heating them under a normal pressure to react them together at a<br>
reflux temperature while distilling off methanol from the reaction<br>
system. The degree of polymerization of the oligomer is usually up<br>
to about 10. If necessary, the reaction may be conducted under<br>
pressure. The reaction can be traced by measuring the amount of<br>
methanol distilled. The esterification ratio is usually about 95%.<br>
When a direct esterification reaction is employed, a<br>
low-molecular-weight oligomer containing BHET can be obtained by<br>
feeding terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol into a reactor and<br>
heating them, if necessary under pressure, while distilling off the<br>
water formed. In the direct esterification reaction, it is preferable<br>
to add a previously prepared lowmolecular-weight oligomer<br>
containing BHET together with raw materials into a reactor and<br>
carry out the direct esterification reaction in the presence of the<br>
lowmolecular-weight oligomer.<br>
Subsequently, the thus obtained low-molecular-weight<br>
oligomer is transferred to a polymerization reactor and is heated<br>
under reduced pressure to a temperature not lower than the<br>
melting point of polyethylene terephthalate (typically 240 to 280Â°C).<br><br>
Thus, the oligomer is subjected to melt-polycondensation while<br>
unreacted ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol resulting from the<br>
reaction are distilled off from the reaction system under monitoring<br>
of the viscosity of the molten reactants. According to necessity,<br>
the polycondensation reaction may be carried out by using a<br>
plurality of reactors and changing the reaction temperature and<br>
pressure optimally in each reactor. When the viscosity of the<br>
reaction mixture reaches a predetermined value, the pressure<br>
reduction is stopped and the pressure in the polymerization reactor<br>
is returned to a normal pressure with nitrogen gas. Then, the<br>
resulting polyester is discharged from the reactor, for example, in<br>
the form of strand, cooled in water, and cut to form pellets.<br>
According to the invention, polyester having an intrinsic viscosity<br>
[r\] of from 0.4 to 1.0 dL/g can be obtained in this way.<br>
The first or second polycondensation catalysts for producing<br>
polyester of the invention may be added to a reaction system when<br>
direct esterification reaction or transesterification reaction for the<br>
production of the oligomer containing BHET is carried out, or<br>
alternatively may be added to the reaction system when a<br>
low-molecular-weight oligomer is further subjected to<br>
polycondensation reaction after the oligomer is obtained. The<br>
polycondensation catalyst of the invention may be added in the<br>
form of powder to a reaction system, or alternatively may be added<br>
to a reaction system after being dispersed in glycol which is used as<br>
one of the raw materials. However, since the polycondensation<br>
catalysts of the invention can be dispersed easily in glycol,<br>
especially in ethylene glycol, it is preferably added to a reaction<br>
system when direct esterification reaction or transesterification<br>
reaction for the production of the oligomer containing BHET is<br>
carried out.<br>
Either the first or the second polycondensation catalyst of<br>
the invention is used usually in an amount within the range of from<br>
lxlO'5 to lxlO1 parts by mol per 100 parts by mol of the<br>
dicarboxylic acid used or its ester-forming derivative. When the<br>
amount of the polycondensation catalyst of the invention is less<br><br>
than 1x10-5 parts by mol per 100 parts by mol of the dicarboxylic<br>
acid used or its ester-forming derivative, the catalyst activity is not<br>
high enough and therefore it may be impossible to obtain a desired<br>
high-molecular-weight polyester. On the other hand, when it is<br>
more than 1xl0-1 parts by mol, the resulting polyester may be poor<br>
in thermal stability.<br>
The polycondensation catalyst of the invention exhibit<br>
catalyst activity in solid state polymerization and solution<br>
polymerization as well as melt polymerization. In each case,<br>
therefore, the catalyst can be used for the production of polyester.<br>
The polycondensation catalysts of the invention contain no<br>
antimony as an ingredient. Therefore, it does not make resulting<br>
polyesters darkened or it does not contaminate resulting polyesters<br>
as foreign substances. In addition, it has catalyst activity equal to<br>
or higher than those of catalysts containing antimony as an<br>
ingredient and can provide polyesters with excellent hue and<br>
transparency. Moreover, the polycondensation catalyst of the<br>
invention is not poisonous and hence safe.<br>
In the production of polyester by an esterification reaction<br>
or transesterification reaction of a dicarboxylic acid or its<br>
ester-forming derivative and a glycol, it is presumed that the acidic<br>
catalysis of titanic acid is to coordinate, as a Lewis acid, to a<br>
carbonyl group of a dicarboxylic acid or its ester-forming derivative<br>
to make the attack of the glycol to the carbonyl carbon easy and<br>
simultaneously accelerate the dissociation of glycol to increase the<br>
nucleophilicity thereof. However, when the acidic catalysis is too<br>
strong, undesirable side reactions probably occur to cause a<br>
decomposition reaction or coloration of the resulting polyester.<br>
It is presumed that by use of the first polycondensation<br>
catalyst of the invention, a coat layer of titanic acid is formed on<br>
the surface of particles of solid base to render the acidic catalysis of<br>
the titanic acid moderate and, as a result, a high-molecular-weight<br>
polyester excellent in hue and transparency is obtained.<br>
When using the second polycondensation catalyst of the<br>
invention, an excessive basic catalysis of solid base is suppressed<br><br>
by forming an inner coat layer of an oxide of at least one element<br>
selected from silicon, aluminum and zirconium or a composite oxide<br>
of at least two elements selected from silicon, aluminum and<br>
zirconium and an outer coat layer of titanic acid on the surface of<br>
particles of the solid base. In addition, it is presumed that the<br>
acidic catalysis of titanic acid is further improved and, as a result,<br>
high-molecular-weight polyester excellent in hue and transparency<br>
is provided.<br>
According to the invention, however, in the production of<br>
polyester, conventionally known polycondensation catalysts, for<br>
example, those comprised of compounds of antimony, germanium,<br>
titanium, tin, aluminum and the like may be used together unless<br>
the merit of use of the polycondensation catalyst of the invention is<br>
affected. Moreover, alkali metal compounds may, according to<br>
demand, be used together and phosphoric acid compounds may also<br>
be used together for the improvement in thermal stability.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In the production of polyester by an esterification reaction<br>
or transesterification reaction of a dicarboxylic acid or its<br>
ester-forming derivative and a glycol, the use of a polycondensation<br>
catalyst for producing polyester according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain a high-molecular-weight polyester excellent in<br>
hue and transparency at a high polymerization activity without<br>
making the polyester darkened or contaminating the polyester with<br>
foreign substances or causing decomposition of the polyester during<br>
the production of polyester.<br>
Examples<br>
In the following Examples and Comparative Examples, the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of polyester obtained was measured in<br>
accordance with ISO 1628-1, and the hue was measured using a 45Â°<br>
diffusion type color difference meter (SC2-CH, manufactured by<br><br>
Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.). The haze value of polyester<br>
obtained was measured according to JIS K-7136 using a 5-mm thick<br>
plate. The plate was a rectangular plate with steps prepared by<br>
heating and melting polyester at 280Â°C and molding.<br>

Reference Example 1<br>
(Preparation of aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide)<br>
5 L of water was placed in a reactor, and then 16.7 L of 4<br>
mol/L aqueous solution of magnesium chloride and 8.4 L of 14.3<br>
mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide were added<br>
simultaneously thereto under stirring. Thereafter, a<br>
hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 170Â°C for 0.5 hours.<br>
The thus obtained magnesium hydroxide was collected by<br>
filtration and washed with water. The resulting cake was<br>
resuspended in water to yield an aqueous slurry of magnesium<br>
hydroxide (123 g/L).<br>
Reference Example 2<br>
(Preparation of aqueous slurry of hydrotalcite)<br>
A mixed solution of 2.6 L of 3.8 mol/L aqueous solution of<br>
magnesium sulfate and 2.6 L of 0.85 mol/L aqueous solution of<br>
aluminum sulfate and a mixed solution of 2.8 L of S.3 mol/L aqueous<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide and 2.6 L of 2.54 mol/L aqueous<br>
solution of sodium carbonate were added simultaneously to a<br>
reactor under stirring. Thereafter, a hydrothermal reaction was<br>
conducted at 180Â°C for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction,<br>
the resulting slurry was filtered, washed with water, dried and<br>
pulverized. Thus, hydrotalcite having a composition<br>
Mgo.7Al0.3(OH)2(C03)0.15 0.48H2O was obtained. The hydrotalcite<br>
was suspended in water to yield an aqueous slurry of hydrotalcite<br>
(100 g/L).<br>
Preparation of First Polycondensation Catalysts and Examples of<br>
Production of Polyester Using the Catalyst<br><br>
Example 1<br>
(Preparation of polycondensation catalyst A)<br>
0.016 L of aqueous solution of titanium tetrachloride (69.2<br>
g/L in terms of TiO2 and 0.016 L of aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide (99.6 g/L in terms of NaOH) were prepared. 9.0 L of the<br>
aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide (123 g/L) obtained in<br>
Reference Example 1 was placed in a 25-L capacity reactor. Then,<br>
the aqueous solution of titanium tetrachloride and the aqueous<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide were added dropwise simultaneously<br>
to the aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide over 0.02 hours so<br>
that the aqueous slurry had a pH of 10.0. After completion of the<br>
addition, ageing was conducted for 1 hour and thereby a coat layer<br>
of titanic acid was formed on the surface of magnesium hydroxide<br>
particles.<br>
The thus obtained aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide<br>
particles having on their surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid was<br>
filtered, washed with water, dried and then pulverized. Thus,<br>
polycondensation catalyst A of the invention was obtained. The<br>
content of titanic acid coat in the polycondensation catalyst, in<br>
terms of TiO2, was 0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
magnesium hydroxide.<br>
(Production of polyester a)<br>
13.6 g (0.070 mol) of dimethyl terephthalate, 10.0 g (0.16<br>
mol) of ethylene glycol, 0.022 g of calcium acetate dihydrate and<br>
0.0012 g (2.lx10-5 mol; 0.03 part by mol per 100 parts by mol of<br>
dimethyl terephthalate) were placed in a glass reactor with a side<br>
pipe. Then, a part of the reactor was soaked in an oil bath at<br>
197Â°C so that the dimethyl terephthalate was dissolved in the<br>
ethylene glycol. A capillary was inserted into a reaction tube so<br>
that it reached the bottom of the reactor. While distilling most of<br>
resulting methanol by blowing nitrogen into the reactor for 1 hour<br>
using this capillary, heating was continued for 2 hours to yield an<br>
oligomer containing BHET.<br>
Subsequently, when heating at 222Â°C was continued for 15<br><br>
minutes, ethylene glycol started to be distilled and<br>
polycondensation started. Thereafter, the temperature was<br>
increased to 283Â°C. When this temperature was maintained,<br>
ethylene glycol was further distilled and the polycondensation<br>
progressed. Ten minutes later, the reduction of pressure was<br>
started and the pressure was reduced to 27 Pa or lower over 15<br>
minutes. Then, the polycondensation was terminated in 3 hours.<br>
After the termination of the polycondensation reaction, the<br>
pressure in the reactor was returned to normal pressure with<br>
nitrogen gas. The resulting polyester was discharged in a strand<br>
form through an outlet opening at the bottom of the reactor. The<br>
strand was cooled and cut, yielding polyester pellets. The<br>
intrinsic viscosity, hue and haze value of the thus obtained<br>
polyester are shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
(Production of polyester b)<br>
43 g (0.26 mol) of terephthalic acid and 19 g (0.31 mol) of<br>
ethylene glycol were placed in a reactor and stirred under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere to prepare a slurry. An esterification<br>
reaction was performed over 4 hours while the temperature in the<br>
reactor was kept at 250Â°C and the relative pressure based on the<br>
atmospheric pressure was kept at 1.2xlO5 Pa. 50 g of the thus<br>
obtained low-molecular weight oligomer was transferred to a<br>
polycondensation reactor held at 250Â°C and normal pressure under<br>
a nitrogen gas atmosphere.<br>
A slurry was prepared by dispersing 0.0022 g (3.9x10-5 mol,<br>
0.015 part by mol per 100 parts by mol of the terephthalic acid<br>
component subjected to the polycondensation) in ethylene glycol.<br>
Then, the slurry was added to the polycondensation reactor.<br>
Subsequently, the temperature in the reactor was increased from<br>
250Â°C to 280Â°C over 3 hours. This temperature was maintained<br>
and the pressure was reduced from normal pressure to an absolute<br>
pressure of 40 Pa. While this pressure was maintained, heating<br>
was continued for additional two hours. Thus, a polycondensation<br><br>
reaction was carried out. After the termination of the<br>
polycondensation reaction, the pressure in the reactor was returned<br>
to normal pressure with nitrogen gas. The resulting polyester was<br>
discharged in a strand form through an outlet opening at the<br>
bottom of the reactor. The strand was cooled and cut, providing<br>
polyester pellets. The intrinsic viscosity, hue and haze value of<br>
the thus obtained polyester are shown in Table 1.<br>

in terms of TiO2) and 0.16 L of aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide (99.6 g/L in terms of NaOH) were prepared. 9.0 L of the<br>
aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide (123 g/L) obtained in<br>
Reference Example 1 was placed in a 25-L capacity reactor. Then,<br>
the aqueous solution of titanium tetraehloride and the aqueous<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide were added dropwise simultaneously<br>
to the aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide over 0.2 hours so<br>
that the aqueous slurry had a pH of 10.0. After completion of the<br>
addition, ageing was conducted for 1 hour and thereby a coat layer<br>
of titanic acid was formed on the surface of magnesium hydroxide<br>

The thus obtained aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide<br>
particles having on their surfaces a coat layer of titanic acid was<br>
filtered, washed with water, dried and then pulverized. Thus,<br>
polycondensation catalyst B of the invention was obtained. The<br>
content of titanic acid coat in the polycondensation catalyst, in<br>
terms of TiO2, was 1.0 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
magnesium hydroxide.<br>
(Production of polyester c)<br>

the same manner as Example 1, polyester was obtained. The<br>

slurry of magnesium hydroxide (123 g/L) obtained in Reference<br>
Example 1 was placed in a 25-L capacity reactor. Then, the<br>
aqueous solution of titanium tetrachloride and the aqueous solution<br>
of sodium hydroxide were dropwise added dropwise simultaneously<br>
to the aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide over 2 hours so that<br>
the aqueous slurry had a pH of 10.0. After completion of the<br>

filtered, washed with water, dried and then pulverized. Thus,<br>
polycondensation catalyst C of the invention was obtained. The<br>
content of titanic acid coat in the polycondensation catalyst, in<br>

having an intrinsic viscosity, hue and haze value almost<br>
comparable with those obtained using antimony trioxide as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst can be obtained according to the<br>
invention. On the other hand, when using titanic acid solely as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst, only polyesters having low intrinsic<br>
viscosities and also being inferior in hue and haze value are<br>
obtained. Even if a mixture of titanic acid with magnesium<br>
hydroxide or hydrotalcite is used as a polycondensation catalyst,<br>
resulting polyesters have low intrinsic viscosities and also have<br>
hues and haze values which are unsatisfactory.<br>
Preparation of Second Polycondensation Catalysts and Examples of<br>
Production of Polyester Using the Catalyst<br>
In the polycondensation catalysts obtained in the following<br>
Examples, the amounts, in parts by weight per 100 parts by weight<br>
of a solid base, of silicon oxides, aluminum oxides and zirconium<br>
oxides are in terms of SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2, respectively. In the<br>
case of a complex oxide, when elements contained therein include<br>
silicon, aluminum and zirconium, the amounts thereof are<br>
calculated in terms of SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2.<br>
Example 1<br>
(Preparation of polycondensation catalyst A)<br>
9.0 L of the aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide (123<br>
g/L) obtained in Reference Example 1 was placed in a 25-L capacity<br>
reactor and then the temperature was increased to 60Â°C. While<br>
the temperature was maintained., 190.9 g of aqueous solution of<br>
sodium silicate (29% by weight in terms of SiO2) was added.<br>
Further, sulfuric acid was added until the pH reached 8.5, followed<br>
by ageing for 1 hour. The resulting slurry was filtered and washed<br>
with water, thereby forming an inner coat layer of silicon oxide on<br>
the surface of magnesium hydroxide particles.<br>
To the slurry of magnesium hydroxide particles having an<br>
inner coat layer thereon, 0.016 L of aqueous solution of titanium<br><br>
tetrachloride (69.2 g/L in terms of TiO2) and 0.016 L of aqueous<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide (99.6 g/L in terms of NaOH) were<br>
dropwise added simultaneously over 0.02 hours so that the pH of<br>
the slurry reached 10.0. After completion of the addition, ageing<br>
was conducted for 1 hour and thereby an outer coat layer of titanic<br>
acid was formed on the inner coat layer.<br>
The thus obtained aqueous slurry of magnesium hydroxide<br>
particles having an inner and outer coat layers was filtered, washed<br>
with water, dried and then pulverized. Thus, polycondensation<br>
catalyst A of the invention was obtained which had a silicon oxide<br>
inner coat layer in an amount of 5 parts by weight and a titanic acid<br>
outer coat layer in an amount of 0.1 parts by weight, per 100 parts<br>
by weight of magnesium hydroxide, respectively.<br>
(Production of polyester a)<br>
In a glass reactor with a side pipe, 13.6 g (0.070 mol) of<br>
dimethyl terephthalate, 10.0 g (0.16 mol) of ethylene glycol, 0.022 g<br>
of calcium acetate dihydrate and 0.0013 g (2.1x10-5 mol; 0.03 part<br>
by mol per 100 parts by mol of dimethyl terephthalate) were placed<br>
and then a part of the reactor was soaked in an oil bath at 197Â°C so<br>
that the dimethyl terephthalate was dissolved in the ethylene<br>
glycol. A capillary was inserted into a reaction tube so that it<br>
reached the bottom of the reactor. While distilling most of<br>
resulting methanol by blowing nitrogen into the reactor for 1 hour<br>
using this capillary, heating was continued for 2 hours to provide<br>
an oligomer containing BHET.<br>
Subsequently, when heating at 222Â°C was continued for 15<br>
minutes, ethylene glycol started to be distilled and<br>
polycondensation started. Thereafter, the temperature was<br>
increased to 283Â°C. When this temperature was maintained,<br>
ethylene glycol was further distilled and the polycondensation<br>
progressed. Ten minutes later, the reduction of pressure was<br>
started and the pressure was reduced to 27 Pa or lower over 15<br>
minutes. Then, the polycondensation was terminated in 3 hours.<br>
After the termination of the polycondensation reaction, the<br>
pressure in the reactor was returned to normal pressure with<br><br>
nitrogen gas. The resulting polyester was discharged in a strand<br>
form through an outlet opening in the bottom of the reactor. The<br>
strand was cooled and cut, providing polyester pellets.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity, hue and haze value of the thus<br>
obtained polyester are shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
(Production of polyester b)<br>
43 g (0.26 mol) of terephthalic acid and 19 g (0.31 mol) of<br>
ethylene glycol were placed in a reactor and stirred under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere to prepare a slurry. An esterification<br>
reaction was performed over 4 hours while the temperature in the<br>
reactor was kept at 250Â°C and the relative pressure based on the<br>
atmospheric pressure was kept at 1.2x10-5 Pa. 50 g of the thus<br>
obtained low-molecular weight oligomer was transferred to a<br>
polycondensation reactor held at 250Â°C and normal pressure under<br>
a nitrogen gas atmosphere.<br>
A slurry was prepared by dispersing 0.0024 g (3.9x10-5 mol,<br>
0.015 part by mol per 100 parts by mol of the terephthalic acid<br>
component subjected to the polycondensation) in ethylene glycol,<br>
and the slurry was then charged into the polycondensation reactor.<br>
Subsequently, the temperature in the reactor was increased from<br>
250Â°C to 280Â°C over 3 hours. This temperature was maintained<br>
and the pressure was reduced from normal pressure to an absolute<br>
pressure of 40 Pa over 1 hour. While this pressure was maintained,<br>
heating was continued for additional two hours. Thus, a<br>
polycondensation reaction was carried out. After the termination<br>
of the polycondensation reaction, the pressure in the reactor was<br>
returned to normal pressure with nitrogen gas. The resulting<br>
polyester was discharged in a strand form through an outlet<br>
opening in the bottom of the reactor. The strand was cooled and cut,<br>
yielding polyester pellets. The intrinsic viscosity, hue and haze<br>
value of the thus obtained polyester are shown in Table 2.<br>
