Description:<br>
The Invention pertains to a method for manufacture of a cross-wound spool at the winding heads of a winding machine.<br>
During the manufacture of a cross-wound spool, to eliminate the thread defect, rewinding of the thread at a winding machine from supply (delivery) spool on to take up spool (winding spool) , the running thread is constantly monitored. The thread defects if any, are cutout from the thread, both the resultant thread ends are jointed again with one another and the manufacturing operation is started again. During the cleaning of the defective thread it must be ensured, that the defective thread is completely cleaned off, irrespective of the fact, whether it concerns to point focal or long thick or thin positions. Further more during the cleaning operation only the defective thread parts should be cleaned, so that as far as possible a small quantity of thread wastage accumulates.<br>
A winding device is known from the DE OS 20 36 898, in case of which after ascertainment of defective thread the take-up (winding) spool is immediately braked, without the thread being cut, which stops the manufacturing process too. From development of the defective thread till the stopping of the take up (winding ) spool the angular momentum of the spool or of the spool drum are counted. During unwinding of the defective thread from the take up (winding) spool, the angular momentum is recounted up to the zero. The unwound (uncoiled) thread, which is drawn in as loop (noose) then contains the defect. After separation of the defective thread loops the non-defective upper thread and lower threads are jointed to each other . The manufacturing process is then re-started.<br>
This known method is sensible only in case of low winding speed, since otherwise from development of the defects till the stopping of the take-up spool a considerable length of thread would be wound on to take up spool which is then wasted. In case of sharp braking there exists the danger, that the thread tears off. If the spool is braked on its peripheral area with the help of a batching roller, then there exists the danger of the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
damage of the topmost thread layer. Furthermore, the additional unwinding time for the excess thread lessens efficiency of the machine.<br>
It is similarly known from the DE 39 11 505 Al, during the manufacturing process, the thread run-up after development of an error is allowed in an uncut manner on the sharply braked take up spool. Also in case of this method, a substantial amount of waste thread being wound on the take up spool during the braking phase, which can no more be salvaged. The rewinding time of the take up spool during unwinding of the defective thread is restricted either through a time relay, in the process of which the pre-set unwinding time is based upon the experimental values or the thread during unwinding is led past a sensor for determining the passage of the defective portion. Thereafter the measures for elimination of the defective portions and for re establishment of the thread connection are initiated.<br>
If the unwinding time of the defective thread portion is limited by a time relay, the unwinding time must be adjusted to the unfavourable circumstances, which results therefrom, that the thread-end running-on on the take up spool is not immediately absorbed the defect becomes an extended one. For this reason the suction (vacuum) pipe is left to rotating in the unwinding direction, till the absorption of the thread-end can be assumed on the basis of the experimental values. As a result, completely uncontrollable thread lengths are absorbed in the vacuum pipe, according to the situation, whether the thread starting was already immediately upon positioning the vacuum pipe in front of the take-up spool or the starting end of the thread was detected only at the end of the pre-set searching time.<br>
A method for cleaning out thread defects during manufacturing of a cross wound spool is known from European Patent Publication EP 0 419 821 Bl, wherein a differentiation is made between conventional thread defects and thread defects caused by an auxiliary piecing thread which is used to repair thread breaks in ring spinning machines. If a thread defect caused by the normal spinning process occurs, a short, predetermined thread piece is pulled off the batching spool and removed, while when a defect caused by piecing occurs, which can be detected by means of the thread cross section, sufficient thread<br><br>
-4-<br>
is always removed from the batching spool so that the auxiliary thread in its entire known length, together with the pieced location, is removed. Therefore two different thread lengths are predetermined for the removal of any given defect, the shorter predetermined thread length being intended for defects caused by the spinning process, and the longer predetermined thread length being intended for defects caused by the auxiliary thread. Because of the fixed thread lengths to be removed, this method does not permit the precision removal of short thread defects caused by spinning because then it would not be assured that longer thread defects would be completely removed because of the fixed cleaning out length.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly an object of the instant invention to provide a method for manufacture of a cross-wound spool wherein the threads running from a delivery spool to the batching spool being continuously monitored for cleaning of thread defects.<br>
This object is attained in accordance with the invention by providing a method for manufacturing a cross wound spool by removing defects from a traveling thread being wound from a delivery spool onto a batching spool at a batching head of a spool batching machine, basically comprising the steps of monitoring the traveling thread for defects and, when a thread defect has been detected, interrupting the batching process by cutting the thread downstream of the detected defect thereby forming an upper thread with the defect extending to the batching spool and a lower thread extending from the delivery spool. The batching spool is stopped and the length of the upper thread wound onto the batching spool between the time of the detection of the defect and the time of making the thread cut is determined. The batching spool is then rotated in an unbatching direction for a predeterminable number of revolutions to unwind therefrom the defect of the upper thread, and the upper thread unwound from the batching spool is aspirated into a suction tube thereat. The presence of the upper thread within the suction tube is sensed, and the unbatching of the upper thread is stopped when the determined thread length has been aspirated into the suction tube. The aspirated upper thread from the batching spool is inserted into a thread end jointing device with the thread defect disposed outside of the thread end jointing device to be cut and discarded, and similarly the lower thread from the delivery spool is inserted into the thread end jointing device. The upper and lower threads are then spliced while cutting and removing the defect of the upper thread, and then the batching process is restarted with no defect<br><br>
-5-<br>
remaining in the thread.<br>
In accordance with the method of the invention, it is thus possible to manufacture a cross-wound<br>
spool the thread is completely removed the thread over its defective length, but still to limit the <br>
removed thread length to essentially only the length of the defect. So that only the thread defect is exclusively cleaned, the entry of the thread into the suction tube, which aspirates the defective thread from the batching spool while rotating in the unbatching direction, is monitored by a sensor arranged in the suction tube. As soon as the sensor detects the entry of the thread into the suction tube, the length of thread unwound from the batching spool and entering the suction tube is determined. This thread unbatching step and the aspiration of the thread is stopped when a sufficient length of unwound thread has been aspirated into the suction tube, as determined on the basis of the thread batching length determined after detection of the defect, so that the length of thread wound up since the appearance of the thread defect will remain outside of the thread end jointing device to be cut off when subsequently inserted into the thread end jointing device. As a result, a completely defect-free upper thread is provided for connection with the lower thread.<br>
The invention also makes it possible to remove relatively long thread defects in course of the manufacturing process without generating additional waste. In this case, the cutting signal of the cleaner which checks the thread quality to determine defects is suppressed until a thread corresponding to the desired physical requirements of the thread is again registered.<br>
Since, besides those thread defects limited in their length, there are also thread defects whose length cannot be predicted, for example because of the presence of a wrong thread count or with thread with a continuing defect, a limitation on the length of the thread to be checked is preselected for long thread defects. If at the end of this preselected length a defect is still detected to be present in the thread, the thread is cut.<br>
If a thread cut is performed because of such a preselected defect length limitation, it is possible in accordance with a further aspect of the invention to set an alarm signal at the batching head to indicate that a defect has occurred which cannot be corrected by means of a thread cut and the aspiration and removal of a defined thread length. Appropriate action is then taken, e.g., further operation of the<br><br>
- 6-<br>
batching head is blocked, until an operator has checked the batching head and removed the defect.<br>
In a farther feature of the invention, it is possible to provide for a change of the delivery spool, in addition to removing the thread defect, when a thread cut is made because of a preselected length limitation. Under such circumstances, it can be assumed that the thread remaining on the first delivery spool is also defective and that therefore the entire delivery spool should be changed.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, it is possible to mark or otherwise identify delivery spools detected to have defective thread thereby to prevent them from being again placed into a machine, and possibly also to indicate the reason for the removal of the delivery spool. For example, each delivery spool or the support for each delivery spool, e.g., a pallet, peg tray, or the like,may be provided with a device in which data can be stored to provide information regarding the delivery spool at a reading station.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the invention, the length of the already aspirated thread is compared with the defective length during the removal of thread defects when the defective thread end aspirated from the batching spool is registered by the sensor in the suction tube. By means of this comparison, a decision can be made whether the defect is already in the suction tube or whether it is necessary to unwind an appropriately longer defective portion of the thread which has been wound on the batching spool. The control of the drive motor of the device which drives the batching spool in the unbatching direction, i.e., normally the batching roller, is dependent on mis comparison. The suction tube only remains in front of the batching spool until the defective piece of thread has been completely wound off the batching spool, and thereafter it is immediately pivoted into a position for inserting the thread in the thread end jointing device. Since this step in the present process continues for only the time necessary for the thread end to be actually registered and the thread defect to be aspirated off the delivery spool, the course of the present process is considerably accelerated in comparison with the conventional method in which the suction tube remains in front of the delivery spool for a fixed predetermined length of time.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the sensor is positioned in the suction tube at a sufficient distance from its mouth that, with short thread defects up to a length of a few centimeters,<br><br>
-7-<br>
the defective portion of the thread is already aspirated sufficiently far into the suction tube when the thread end is first detected in the suction tube by the sensor. In addition, the placement of the sensor in the suction tube can be selected in relation to the distance possibly existing between the cleaner and the cutting device. In order to be able to insert a thread grasped by means of a suction tube securely into the thread end jointing device, the thread must be present in the suction tube to a defined length so that the thread is in a tensioned state. Since a defective length of only a few centimeters is already contained in the length of thread which is wound off the batching spool during a single revolution of the batching roller, the defective piece of thread as a rule will already be positioned in the suction tube when the minimum length of thread required for secure insertion of the thread into the thread end jointing device has been aspirated. Therefore, when the sensor registers the thread end in the suction tube, the latter can be immediately pivoted into a position for inserting the thread into the thread end jointing device. Thus, with short thread defects, it is not necessary that the suction tube remain in front of the delivery spool any longer than the time until the thread end has been registered in the suction tube by the sensor.<br>
Another aspect of the invention makes it possible, at the time when the defective thread length has been wound off the batching spool and has been aspirated by the suction tube, to clamp the thread in the suction tube. Otherwise, if the pivoting movement of the suction tube for inserting the thread into the thread end jointing device is not exactly matched to the revolutions of the batching spool while the thread is unwound, the position of the thread inside the suction tube can change as a result of the thread being pulled out or further aspirated, whereby it cannot be assured, whether the defective thread portion lies completely outside of the thread end jointing device. By means of the thread clamping provided within the suction tube by the present invention, it is assured that the thread end aspirated into the suction tube does actually remain in the suction tube and is not pulled out again. For this reason, the clamping of the thread is only released when the defective thread is cut at the thread end jointing device.<br>
Under a further feature of the present invention, the circumferential velocity of the batching roller when the thread is pulled off the batching spool is matched to the pivot movement of the suction tube to accomplish unbatching of a thread length which precisely corresponds to the thread length between the batching spool and the thread end jointing device. This aspect of the invention can additionally be<br><br>
-8-<br>
used in conjunction with clamping of the thread in the suction tube, but has particular advantage if the suction tube does not have a clamping device. By means of this step, it is assured that no additional thread can be aspirated into the suction tube or pulled out of the suction tube during the insertion of the thread into the thread end jointing device, and it is therefore assured that the defective thread portion lies completely outside of the thread end jointing device after having been inserted therein.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be described and understood in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and the following description of an exemplary embodiment.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is an end elevational view of a batching head of a spool batching machine equipped in accordance with the present invention with a suction tube positionable in front of the batching spool for aspiration of a thread following the cutting thereof because of a detected defect, and<br>
FIG. 2 is a similar end elevational view of the batching head of FIG. 1 showing the batching head after the thread has been inserted into the thread end jointing device by the suction tube.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawings and initially to FIG. 1, the structure of a batching head 1 of a spool batching machine (not shown in greater detail herein for sake of simplicity and clarity of illustration) is schematically shown. Only the features of the batching head necessary for understanding the invention are represented and described.<br>
FIG. 1 represents the situation in which, because a thread defect has been detected, the normal operation of the batching head 1 for rebatching thread supplied from a delivery spool 3 onto a batching spool 4 has been interrupted by lifting the batching spool 4 out of peripheral driven contact with a batching roller 14, at the same time the thread path has been interrupted by cutting the thread, and measures have been initiated for removing the thread defect, all according to the present invention.<br><br>
-9-<br>
This interruption in the normal running path 2 followed by the thread during batching operation between the delivery spool 3 and the batching spool 4 is indicated by the dashed line 2. Following the cutting of the thread (by conventional means not shown), a thread gripping suction tube 5 has been pivoted downwardly into a position in the thread path 2 above the delivery spool 3 and has already aspirated the leading end of the thread 6 fed from the delivery spool 3 (referred to herein as the lower thread) and has delivered such thread 6 to a thread end jointing device 8, e.g., a splicing device. To this end, the gripper tube 5 has been pivoted from an initial thread grasping position, represented at 5' in faint lines, wherein an aspirating opening 7 at the free end of the tube 5 for catching the lower thread 6 is in the position T in the thread path 2, into the position represented at 5 in full lines by means of a drive (not represented here) which is connected by means of a line 5a with a main central control device 9 for the batching head 1. The pivot joint 10, around which the gripper tube 5 is pivoted, simultaneously provides a pneumatic connection to a vacuum line 11 which communicates with a suction conduit 12 of the central vacuum supply of the spool batching machine. The lower thread 6 held by the gripper tube 5 extends below the thread end jointing device 8 in an opened thread tensioner 13, which is also connected with the control device 9 of the batching head 1 via a line 13a.<br>
The cutting of the thread upon detection of the defect takes place at a location following the defect (as viewed in the direction of thread travel) and thus, after the cutting of the thread, the defective portion of the thread is wound onto the batching spool 4. Before removing the defective portion of the thread, it is therefore necessary to unwind the defective thread piece completely from the batching spool 4, sufficiently that the defective portion of thread lies completely outside the thread end jointing device 8 after the thread has been inserted into the thread end jointing device 8. At the stage of the process shown in FIG. 1, the batching spool 4 has already been lowered again into contact with the batching roller 14. The batching spool 4 is supported by a spool holder 15, which is seated in a pivot joint 16 in the machine frame 17 (shown only schematically). The actuation of the drive (not represented here) for pivoting the spool frame 15 is controlled by the control device 9 via the line 15a.<br>
The batching roller 14 is driven by a drive (not represented here) which is also connected by means of the line 14a with the control device 9. For unbatching the defective thread piece, the batching roller 14 is driven opposite the normal thread batching direction, as indicated by the arrow 19, and in turn its circumferential periphery 20 drives the batching spool 4 by factional contact therewith in the thread<br><br>
-10-<br>
unbatching direction 21.<br>
A suction tube 22 is seated in a pivot joint 24 in the machine frame 17, which also provides communication of the tube 22 with the central suction conduit 12 of the vacuum supply of the spool batching machine via a line 25 therebetween. In FIG. 1, the suction tube 22 is shown to have been pivoted into an operating position with its mouth 23 in front of the circumferential surface 20 of the batching spool 4. FIG. 2 depicts the normal resting position of the suction tube 22. The pivotal movement of the suction tube 22 out of the resting position of FIG. 2 into the operating position of FIG. 1 is performed by means of a drive (not shown) which is connected via a line 22a with the control device 9. A valve (also not represented) is also controlled by the control device 9 and connects the suction tube 22 with the suction conduit 12.<br>
As the batching spool 4 is rotated in the unbatching direction, the trailing cut thread end 27 resting on the circumferential surface 20 of the batching spool 4 is aspirated into the suction tube 22 by means of the suction flow, symbolized by the arrow 26 in FIG. 1, prevailing at the mouth 23 of the suction tube 22, represented in section in FIG. 1. The exemplary illustration of FIG. 1 shows the moment in which the thread end 27 has just reached a sensor 28 disposed in the suction tube 22. The presence of the thread end 27 in the suction tube 22 is reported by the sensor 28 via the line 28a to the control device 9. The sensor 28 is arranged at a selected distance from the mouth 23 of the suction tube 22 that a sufficient length of thread is aspirated in order to maintain the thread tensioned during its insertion into the thread end jointing device 8. With short defects in the range of millimeters to a few centimeters, the defective thread piece will have thereby already been unwound and aspirated when the thread end 27 has been aspirated as far as the sensor 28.<br>
When the thread end 27 has reached the sensor 28, a check must be made as to whether at this time the defective thread piece has already been unwound from the batching spool 4 and whether therefore the unbatching and aspiration of the thread can be stopped. To assist in this determination, a thread cleaner device 29 is positioned within the normal thread travel path 2 to detect the presence and length of defects in the traveling thread and the cleaner 29 is connected to the central control device 9 via a signal line 29a to report such data. If the cleaner 29 has reported a short defect to the control device 9, and the length of thread which has been unwound from the batching spool 4 as of the detection of the<br><br>
-11-<br>
thread end 27 by the sensor 28 is longer than the measured defect length, unbatching of the thread is immediately stopped. The thread end 27 can be clamped in the suction tube 22 by means of a clamping device 30 before the suction tube 22 is pivoted back into the initial position represented in FIG. 2 and thus, in the process of such pivotal movement of the tube 22, the tube inserts the thread into the thread end jointing device 8. The clamping device 30 is controlled via the line 30a by the control device 9. The clamping device 30 is reopened when the end length 27 of the thread containing the defective thread piece is subsequently cut from the trailing length of the thread within the thread end jointing device, whereby the thread end 27 with the defect is aspirated through the tube 22 for disposal.<br>
In the instant exemplary embodiment of the invention, the length of the defect in the wound thread is determined as follows. A magnet wheel 32 is arranged on the shaft 31 of the batching roller 14, having a defined number of magnetic poles uniformly distributed over its circumference, and a sensor 33 is mounted in a stationary disposition on the machine frame adjacent the wheel 32 to register a magnetic pulse upon each passage of each magnetic pole. The number of the pulses of the magnetic poles is counted during each revolution of the magnetic wheel 32 and is transmitted by means of a signal line 33a to the computer of the control device 9, whereby the length of the thread applied by the batching roller 14 to the batching spool 4 is calculated by means of the counted pulses. Of course, those persons skilled in the art will readily recognize that any other method for the measurement of the length of the thread wound on the batching roller is also possible.<br>
Thus, every time the cleaner 29 recognizes the start of a thread defect, the length of the defective thread piece is measured up to the time the cleaner 29 recognizes the end of the defect or until it can be concluded, because the detected measured length of defective thread is extended, that most or all of the subsequent thread can also be considered to be defective. At that time, a cutting and clamping device 34 is actuated by the control device 9 via the line 34a for cutting the thread and the batching spool is stopped. The spatial arrangement of the cleaner 29 and the cutting device 34 is taken into consideration when issuing this cutting signal, so that the cut is always made behind the end of the thread defect (as viewed in the traveling direction of the thread being wound) with the exception of the thread cut made when the thread is continuously defective.<br>
As the batching spool 4 is stopped, the cut thread end 27 is wound onto the surface of the spool 4 at<br><br>
- 12-<br>
which the thread end comes under the influence of the suction force applied through the suction tube 22, causing the thread end to be aspirated into the tube as the batching spool is driven in reverse in an unbatching direction. When the thread end 27 reaches the sensor 28 in the suction tube 22, a defined thread length has necessarily already been unwound from the batching spool 4. If the measured length of the defect as previously determined by the cleaner 29 is less than the already unwound thread length, unbatching of the thread is immediately stopped and the suction tube 22 is pivoted back into its initial position as represented in FIG. 2 for inserting the thread into the thread end jointing device 8, If, however, the measured length of the thread defect is greater than the thread length which has been unwound as of the time that the sensor 28 detects the end 27, unbatching of the thread from the batching spool 4 is continued and the additional thread length continues to be aspirated by the suction tube 22. In the process, the unwound thread length is continuously measured by means of the length measuring device, namely the sensor 33 in connection with the magnetic wheel 32, and is compared with the defective thread length originally determined by the cleaner 29. When the thread length unwound from the batching spool 4 matches the previously determined length of the defective thread, unbatching of the thread from the batching spool and aspiration by the tube 22 are stopped, and the suction tube 22 is then pivoted back into its initial position in order to insert the defective thread into the thread end jointing device 8 such that the defective portion of thread comes to rest outside of the thread end jointing device 8 and can be aspirated after cutting thereby prior to thread end connecting operation.<br>
FIG. 2 represents the situation wherein the suction tube 22 has returned to its initial position and in the process has inserted into the thread end jointing device 8 the non-defective thread 35, coming from the batching spool 4 and trailing the defective portion 36 of thread. The aspirated defective thread portion 36 has been drawn into the pivot tube 22 shown in section, and extends as far as the mouth 23 of the suction tube. Since in the instant example of FIG. 2 the defective portion of the thread is relatively long, exceeding the minimum thread length necessary to be aspirated as far as the sensor 28, the thread extends through the opening in the pivot joint 24 into the adjoining vacuum line 11 and the suction conduit 12. To prepare for the connection of the respective upper and lower thread ends from the batching and delivery spools 3,4 (in the instant example by pneumatic splicing in the thread end connection device 8), the thread pieces projecting past the splicing device 8 are cut off. Thus, the defective thread piece 36 is aspirated into the suction conduit 12 by means of the suction flow still<br><br>
-13-<br>
prevailing in the suction tube 22. The thread piece 37 of the lower thread 6 extending out of the thread end jointing device 8 into the gripper tube 5 is also severed and aspirated off by the suction flow prevailing in the gripper tube 5. Thereafter splicing of the thread ends of the upper thread 35 and the lower thread 6 is actuated via the line 8a. Following splicing, the thread is released back into the thread path 2 shown in dashed lines, and the batching process is again started with a spliced thread free of defects to produce cross wound spools.<br>

We claim:<br>
1. A method for manufacture of a cross-wound spool on a winding head of a winding machine wherein the threads running from a delivery spool to the winding spool being continuously monitored for cleaning of thread defects, comprising the steps of:<br>
monitoring the running thread for defects and, when a thread defect has been detected, interrupting the winding process by cutting the thread downstream of the detected defect thereby forming an upper thread with the defect extending to the winding spool and a bottom thread extending from the delivery spool;<br>
stopping the winding spool, determining the length of the upper thread wound onto the winding spool between the time of the detection of the defect and the time of making the thread cut;<br>
rotating the winding spool in an unwinding direction for a predeterminable number of revolutions to unwind therefrom the defect of the upper thread;<br>
absorbing the uncoiled thread end from the winding spool into a suction pipe, sensing the presence of the thread end within the suction pipe;<br>
stopping the unwinding of the thread end when the determined thread length has been absorbed into the suction pipe;<br>
-	inserting the absorbed thread end from the winding spool into a thread end<br>
jointing device with the thread defect disposed outside of the thread end<br>
jointing device to be cut and discarded;<br>
-	inserting the lower thread from the delivery spool into the thread end<br>
jointing device;<br>
splicing the upper and bottom thread while cutting and removing the defect of the upper thread;<br>
restarting the winding process;<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
and removal of the cross-wound spool from the winding head.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the monitoring of the thread for defects comprises conveying the thread through a thread cleaner for comparing the thread against a predetermined thread profile and, when a defect is detected as a deviation from the predetermined thread profile, suppress`ing the cutting signal in said cleaner until detection of a downstream portion of the thread corresponding to the thread profile is again detected.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the cutting signal in the cleaner is actuated after a predetermined length of the defective thread has been reached.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the alarm is released at the winding head when cutting signal is actuated based on a predetermined length of the defective thread without detection of a downstream portion of the thread corresponding to the thread profile.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in Claim 3 comprising changing the delivery spool following a cutting which is actuated based on a predetermined length of the defective thread without detection of a downstream portion of the thread corresponding to the thread profile.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in Claim 5 wherein said step of changing the delivery spool comprises marking the delivery spool to prevent it from being again placed in the winding machine.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the inserting of the absorbed thread end from the winding spool into the thread end jointing equipment comprises pivoting the suction pipe into a disposition at the thread end jointing equipment for inserting the thread there unto.<br><br>
-16-<br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the unwinding of the thread from the winding spool comprises peripherally driving the winding spool by a batching roller and matching the circumferential velocity of the batching roller to the; pivoting of the suction pipe such that only the thread length corresponding to the thread path between the winding spool and the thread end jointing equipment is unwound.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sensing of the presence of the thread end in the suction pipe: is performed at a distance from an entrance of the suction pipe sufficient that thread defects of a short length will have been absorbed into the suction pipe at the time the absorbed thread end is first sensed in the suction pipe.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising, after unwinding of the defect from<br>
the winding spool and absorbing thereof by the suction pipe, clamping the thread end<br>
in the suction pipe and subsequently releasing the clamping when the thread defect is<br>
cut at the thread end jointing equipment.<br><br>
This invention relates to a method of manufacture of a cross-wound spool on a winding head of a winding machine wherein the threads running from a delivery spool to the winding spool being continuously monitored comprising the steps of : monitoring the running thread for defects and, when a thread defect has been detected, interrupting the winding process by cutting the thread downstream of the detected defect thereby forming an upper thread with the defect extending to the winding spool and a bottom thread extending from the delivery spool; stopping the winding spool, determining the length of the upper thread wound onto the winding spool between the time of the detection of the defect and the time of making the thread cut; rotating the winding spool in an unwinding direction for a predeterminable number of revolutions to unwind therefrom the defect of the upper thread; absorbing the uncoiled thread end from the winding spool into a suction pipe, sensing the presence of the thread end within the suction pipe; sensing the presence of the thread end within the suction pipe; stopping the unwinding of the thread end when the determined thread length has been absorbed into the suction pipe; inserting the absorbed thread end from the winding spool into a thread end jointing device with the thread defect disposed outside of the thread end jointing device to be cut and discarded; inserting the lower thread from the delivery spool into the thread end jointing device; splicing the upper and bottom thread while cutting and removing the defect of the upper thread; restarting the winding process;</td>
