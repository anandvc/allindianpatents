				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a lubricant concentrate, of which the diluted use solution<br>
is suitable for lubricating and cleaning of conveyor belt installations in the food industry,<br>
particularly by means of immersion or automatic belt lubricating systems.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for the production of the lubricant concentrate or<br>
the aqueous use solution of the lubricant concentrate as well as the use of the lubricant<br>
concentrate and the aqueous use solution for lubricating and cleaning of conveyor belt<br>
installations, in particular by means of immersion lubricating or automatic belt lubricating<br>
installations, particularly in the food industry. The use thereby particularly relates to filling<br>
foods, especially with beverages, of glass and plastic bottles, particularly in this case<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polycarbonate (PC),<br>
boxes, metal cans, glasses, vessels, refillable cans, barrels or vessels, such as KEGs,<br>
beverage containers, paper and cardboard holders and the like.<br>
In food industry the conveyance of beverage packings made of metal, glass, paper,<br>
cardboard and/or plastic using a lubricant concentrate, respectively its aqueous use<br>
solution, is commonly applied.<br>
Presently beverages are being sold in several different containers. Thus, beverages are<br>
offered in glass bottles, plastic bottles, plastic containers, metal cans, boxes, wax cartons,<br>
etc. In the filling plants these containers have to be transported during filling to several<br>
stations. Generally this occurs by means of feed or conveyance belt installations (having<br>
chains or tracks), which usually consist of stainless steel or plastic, insofar as these<br>
containers concern glass containers, or the conveyance belt installations consist of plastic<br>
materials like polypropylene or certain polyacetates, insofar as these containers concern<br>
other than glass bottles or glass containers. Following hereafter, such installations are<br>
referred to as feed and conveyance installations or as conveyor belt installations.<br>
During filling and transport of the mentioned containers sometimes a turning over or a<br>
blocking of the containers may occur, while the conveyor belts are running further without<br>
hindrance. Especially in this case a sufficient lubrication of the conveyor belts is required<br>
in order that the belt can move forward without hindrance even when the containers on the<br>
belt cannot move forward during some time.<br>
2<br><br>
For this purpose it is required, as already mentioned before, to lubricate and to clean the<br>
parts of the feed and conveyance installations, which come into contact with the beverage<br>
containers, sufficiently. If the conveyance installations are not lubricated sufficiently this<br>
can, on the one hand, lead to the falling down of the containers, or on the other hand, have<br>
the result that they do not stop, although the respective filing up, cleaning or labelling<br>
station has already been reached. Both kind of malfunctions can lead to longer down time<br>
of the conveyance installations and to considerable loss of capacity.<br>
Presently, there are several different types of lubricant concentrates known, which can in<br>
principal be divided into 4 main groups: i) lubricants on the basis of soap, ii) lubricants on<br>
the basis of polysiloxanes (such as those described in WO 01/18160), iii) lubricants on the<br>
basis of fatty amines (such as those described in WO 98/16603) and iv) lubricants on the<br>
basis of phosphate esters. Additionally, the pH-value of the lubricant compositions (both<br>
the concentrate and the diluted aqueous use solution) may differ, since many of the known<br>
compositions have a pH-value in the range between 5 and 8, but there are also lubricant<br>
compositions known having a pH-value between 7 and 11. Lubricant compositions having<br>
a pH-value within the acid up to the neutral range have the advantage that there is less<br>
stress cracking observed when employing plastic material, such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) bottles. For each lubricants concentrate the individual components<br>
have to be harmonized to provide stable compositions for the pH-range intented to be<br>
applied.<br>
Some of the lubricants based on phosphate esters also include an amine compound. US<br>
6,756,347 Bl discloses lubricant compositions comprising at least one alkyl alkoxylated<br>
phosphate ester, one aryl alkoxylated phosphate ester, one aromatic or linear quaternary<br>
ammonium antimicrobial agent and a liquid carrier, such as water. The phosphate<br>
components are in both cases (alkyl alkoxylated or aryl alkoxylated) either a phosphate<br>
monoester or a phosphate diester. The pH-value of said compositions is in the range<br>
between 6 and 8,5.<br>
Another lubricant on the basis of phosphate esters is disclosed in WO 00/22073. That<br>
lubricant comprises a phosphate monoester with the ester component on the basis of<br>
polyethylene oxide, which is additionally substituted with an amide. A disadvantage of<br>
said lubricant composition is that the synthesis of the phosphate ester component is rather<br>
complex including educts such as phosphorous pentoxide, therefore, the production of the<br>
lubricant concentrate is rather cost-intensive.<br>
3<br><br>
Another lubricant composition based on phosphate esters is disclosed in JP-B 6330079<br>
comprising an alkyl amine and an alkyl (poly)alkoxylated phosphate monoester or a<br>
mixture of the phosphate monoester and the respective phosphate diester. Said<br>
compositions are employed at a pH-value between 5 and 8.<br>
The object of the present invention is the provision of a new and stable lubricant<br>
concentrate on basis of phosphate esters, which can be easily produced at low costs.<br>
Furthermore, the new lubricant concentrate should have at least a comparable or, in<br>
preferred embodiments, an enhanced lubricity causing reduced friction compared to the<br>
known lubricants based on phosphate esters. It is also an object of the invention to provide<br>
a lubricant concentrate causing fast formation of the lubricant film on the conveyor belt<br>
installations (tracks or chains). Furthermore, it is also an object of the present invention<br>
that the lubricant film can be very uniformly applied to the conveyor belt installations.<br>
The object is achieved by a lubricant concentrate containing the following components<br>
(i) at least one amine;<br>
(ii) at least one phosphate according to the general formula (I),<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1A, R1b and R1c independently from each other are the same or different and<br>
indicate C1-C3o-alkyl or -([CH2]m-O)n-R1d, where m is 2 or 3, n is 1 to 10 and<br>
R1d is C1-C30-alkyl, phenyl or phenyl-(C1-C10-alkyl)-;<br>
(iii) at least one acid<br>
(iv) optionally at least one ether carboxylic acid compound with the general<br>
formula (II)<br>
R20-(O(CH2)m)nOCH2COO-M+	(II)<br>
wherein<br>
R20 is a saturated, linear or branched alkyl rest with 1 to 22 carbon atoms or a mono or<br>
polyunsaturated linear or branched alkenyl or alkynyl rest with 2 to 22 carbon atoms or<br>
4<br><br>
an aryl rest optionally substituted with at least one C1-C22 alkyl, C2-C22 alkenyl or C2-<br>
C22-alkynyl,<br>
n is a positive number between 0 and 30, and m is 2 or 3,<br>
M is hydrogen or an alkali metal;<br>
(v) optionally at least one further aid or additive;<br>
whereby the portion of the components (i) + (ii) + (iii) with respect to the concentrate<br>
is 1 to 100 wt. %, and said optional components (iv) and (v) may be present in portions<br>
up to 99 wt. %, whereby the portions (i) - (v) are chosen such that the total results in 100<br>
wt. %.<br>
The advantage of the lubricant concentrate of the present invention is that it can be easily<br>
produced at low cost and enhanced lubricity is provided compared to those lubricant<br>
compositions based on phosphate esters known from the state of the art. Enhanced<br>
lubricity causes reduced friction on the conveyor belt installations (being determined by<br>
the friction coefficient ) and therefore improved conveyance of the employed beverage<br>
packings regardless of their material of the packings or the conveyor's chains.<br>
A further advantage is that the lubricating film is formed faster on the conveyor belt<br>
installations (tracks or chains). This implies that an improved number of beverage<br>
packings (improved capacity) can be handled on the conveyor belt installations, since<br>
these systems can only be operated having a sufficient amount of lubricant on the tracks or<br>
chains forming a preferably uniform lubricating film. In case there is no sufficient and/or<br>
uniform lubrication provided on the tracks or chains of the lubricant belt installations,<br>
beverage packings such as bottles cause either a blocking of the whole system or they may<br>
even be destoyed by falling from the tracks or chains.<br>
A further advantage of the lubricant concentrate of the present invention is that the<br>
lubricating film is formed more uniformly and for a longer period of time on the conveyer<br>
belt installations. Due to the more uniformly formation of the lubricating film on the tracks<br>
or chains the beverage packings can be transported more smoothly. This also implies that a<br>
fewer amount of lubricant concentrate is required to provide a uniform lubricating film,<br>
which is attained for a longer period of time. As a further consequence, less solvent, which<br>
is used for diluting the lubricant concentrate, in particular water, is consumed causing<br>
additional cost reduction.<br>
5<br><br>
The lubricant concentrate of the present invention can be employed for all types of<br>
conveyor belt systems (such as plastic chains or stainless steel chains) and all types of<br>
beverage packing materials (such as glass or plastic containers). In contrast to many of the<br>
known lubricant concentrates, the lubricant concentrate of the present invention has a<br>
significant stability at a pH-range between 3 and 9, since it can be stored as a single phase<br>
system (in form of a clear solution) over several weeks. Preferred lubricant compositions,<br>
containing as a further (optional) component at least one ether carboxylic acid according<br>
to the below indicated general formula II, have the advantage that besides a further<br>
improvement in terms of lubricity also improved water compatibility can be observed in<br>
comparison to those lubricant concentrates of the present invention without these optional<br>
component. Lubricant concentrates additionally containing an ether carboxylic acid are<br>
good sulphate controllers having an excellent hard water tolerance.<br>
The component (i):<br>
The lubricant concentrate according to the invention contains as component (i)<br>
essentially one or more amines. The term "amine", as used in the context of the<br>
invention, includes thereby in a broader context monoamine, polyamine, cyclic<br>
amidine as well as its hydrolysis products or noncyclic synthesis pre-steps,<br>
oxalkylated amine, amine addionally containing an amido-group and salts of the<br>
previously mentioned compounds.<br>
It has to be indicated that due to the presence of further components containing cations, for<br>
example protons, such as the acids of component (iii), the employed amines may be<br>
partially or completely transferred into the corresponding salts during the preparation<br>
and/or storage of the lubricant concentrate. This is particularly relevant if the lubricant<br>
concentrate contains a solvent, such as water, or in the corresponding aqueous use solution<br>
of the lubricant concentrate. The following compounds of components (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)<br>
and (v) are listed with their chemical structure/name before mixing the individual<br>
components with each other to prepare the lubricant concentrate. Nevertheless, the amine<br>
(component (i)) may already be employed in its salt form as starting material when<br>
producing the lubricant concentrate of the present invention.<br>

others, primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary amines according to the general<br>

The ether carboxylic acids according to the general formula are available commercially or can<br>
be synthesized according to processes known from the literature. For example, the compounds<br>
mentioned in the table can be obtained under the trade name AKYPO from the company<br>
CHEM-Y as special surfactant.<br>
The component (v):<br>
The component (v) is optional and therefore only possibly contained in the lubricant<br>
concentrate according to the invention. As component (v), the lubricant concentrate<br>
according to the present invention may contain one or more of the following compounds also<br>
assigned as aid or additive, which can be independently selected from each other.<br>
As component (v) water can be applied. The added water may be soft water, hard water or<br>
softened water, preferably softened water is employed.<br>
18<br><br>
The lubricant concentrate according to the invention may contain as a further optional<br>
component (v) one or more polyethylene glycols (PEG's) with the general formula (XX),<br>
H-(OC2H4)n-OH	(XX),<br>
wherein<br>
n is a positive integer between 5 and &gt; 100,000.<br>
Preferred polyethylene glycols have molecular masses of approx. 200 - 5,000,000 g/mol. The<br>
PEG's concern non-unity substances from a molecular point of view, i.e. polymolecular<br>
compounds which consist of collectives of macro-molecules with different molecular masses.<br>
These compounds are mostly prepared technically by means of alkaline catalyzed polyaddition<br>
of ethylene oxide (oxiran) in systems which mostly contain a low amount of water and with<br>
ethylene glycol as the starting molecule.<br>
In order to characterize the types frequently the main point of the molecular weight division is<br>
used in the art. Thus talked is about a PEG 200, PEG 400, PEG 1000, PEG 10,000, etc.<br>
PEG's with molecular masses of 
approx. 580 are preferred within the scope of the invention; these actual PEG's are liquid<br>
under normal conditions of pressure and temperature and therefore allow a very simple<br>
handling. Especially preferred are PEG's with n approximately between 8 and 13. Such<br>
compounds can be obtained for example under the trade name "Plural" from the company<br>
BASF.<br>
Besides water and/or PEG's also the following aids and/or additives qualify as component (v):<br>
solution intermediates, for example alcohols, polyalcohols, ether or polyether,<br>
especially isopropanol, butylglycol, butyldiglycol or ethyleneglycolether;<br>
Examples of components which qualify as solution intermediates can be found in the<br>
below table.<br>
19<br><br><br>
The amount of the solution intermediates to be used should be determined according to the<br>
individual amine to used, the professional will calculate the required solution intermediate in<br>
the individual case by means of trial and error. In general additions of solution intermediates<br>
in the range of 5 to 20 wt %, calculated on basis of the total composition, will be sufficient.<br>
Optionally, two or more of the solution intermediates may be employed as a mixture.<br>
Further, as aid and / or additives according to the present invention particularly non-ionic and /<br>
or amphoteric surfactants merit consideration, for example fatty alcohols and alkoxylated fatty<br>
alcohols. These surfactants can improve the moistening of the chain and conveyor belts<br>
insofar as this is required in an individual case. In general surfactant additions in the range of<br>
1 to 5 wt. %, calculated on basis of the total composition are sufficient for this purpose. Also,<br>
polyalkylene glycols which are not included in the above indicated polyethylene glycols can<br>
be employed. Additionally, one or more phosphate mono- or diesters as those indicated in US<br>
6,756347 Bl, WO 98/16603 or JP-B 6330079 also qualify as component (v).<br>
Further additives include anti foaming agents, foam regulators, foam stabilizers, moistening<br>
agents, coupling agents, chelation agents or chelate formers or solubility improvers, biocides, like<br>
e.g. bactericides, corrosion inhibitors, pH-buffers, as well as combinations of representatives of<br>
the previously mentioned classes of substances.<br>
20<br><br>
Unless stated otherwise, each of the alkyl (or alkylene), alkenyl (or alkenylene) or<br>
alkkynyl (or alkynylene) residues or fragments defined in formulas (I) to (XX), such as R1<br>
to R21 , R1a to R1d or A1 to A12 may independently be linear or branched, acyclic or cyclic.<br>
This also applies when they are part of other groups, for example in alkoxy groups (C1-<br>
C10-alkyl-O-), alkoxycarbonyl groups or amino groups, or when they are substituted.<br>
Examples for alkyl groups are: methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl,<br>
nonyl, decyl. This comprises both the n-isomers of these residues and isopropyl, isobutyl,<br>
isopentyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl etc.. Furthermore, unless<br>
stated otherwise, the term alkyl here also includes - besides the unsubstituted alkyl<br>
residues - optinally substituted alkyl residues which are substituted by one or more, for<br>
example one, two, three or four, identical or different residues, for example aryl,<br>
heteroaryl C1-C10-alkoxy, -CF3, -OH, -NH2 or halogen. The substituents may be present<br>
in any desired position of the alkyl group. The term alkyl here also expressly includes<br>
cycloalkyl residues and cycloalkyl-alkyl-residues (alkyl substituted by cycloalkyl), where<br>
cycloalkyl contains at least three carbon atoms. Examples for such cycloalkyl residues are<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl. All<br>
cycloalkyl groups may be unsubstituted or optionally substituted by one or more further<br>
residues, as exemplified above in the case of the alkyl groups. The same applies to the<br>
respective alkylene or cycloalkylene fragments.<br>
Examples for alkenyl and alkynyl groups are the vinyl residue, the 1-propenyl residue, the<br>
2-propenyl residue (allyl residue), the 2-butenyl residue, the 2-methyl-2-propenyl residue,<br>
the 3-methyl-2-butenyl residue, the ethynyl residue, the 2-propynyl residue (propargyl<br>
residue), the 2-butynyl residue or the 3-butynyl residue. Unless indicated otherwise the<br>
term alkenyl also includes cycloalkenyl residues and cycloalkenyl-alkyl-residues (alkyl<br>
substituted by cycloalkenyl) containing at least three carbon atoms. The same applies to<br>
the respective cycloalkynyl groups. Examples for cycloalkenyl residues are cyclopentenyl,<br>
cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl. The same applies to the respective<br>
alkenylene, cycloalkenylene, alkynylene or cycloalkynylene fragments. Unless indicated<br>
otherwise, the terms alkenyl, alkynyl, etc. also include polyunsaturated residues such as<br>
alk-dienyl, alk-trienyl, alk-diynyl, etc.<br>
According to the present invention, aryl is a residue derived from mono-, bicyclic or<br>
polycyclic aromatics having between 6 and 30, preferably 6 or 10, carbon atoms, where<br>
the cycle does not contain any heteroatoms. In case it is not a monocycle, the term aryl<br>
includes for its second cycle also its saturated form (perhydro form) or its partially<br>
21<br><br>
unsaturated form (for example in the dihydro form or the tetrahydro form) in case the<br>
respective forms are known and stable. The term aryl as used herein comprises therefore,<br>
for example, bicyclic residues in which both cycles are aromatic as well as bicyclic<br>
residues in which only one cycle is aromatic. Such examples for heteroaryl are: phenyl,<br>
naphthyl, indanyl, 1,2-dihydronaphthenyl, 1,4-dihydronaphthenyl, indenyl or 1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthyl. Preferably, aryl is phenyl.<br>
Furthermore, if residues or fragments defined in formulas (I) to (XX), such as R1 to R21 ,<br>
R1a to R1d or A1 to A12 comprise an aryl (or arylene) fragment, in particular phenyl, said<br>
aryl fragment may be unsubstituted or optionally substituted by one or more identical or<br>
different residues such as halogen C1-C10-alkyl, C1-C10-alkoxy, -OH, -NH2 and -CF3.<br>
Arylalkyl (such as aryl-(C1-C10-alkyl)-, in particular phenyl-(C1-C10-alkyl)-) means an<br>
alkyl residue (such as C1-C10-alkyl), which in turn is substituted by an aryl residue.<br>
It has to be emphasized that the below indicated proportions of the individual components (i)<br>
to (iii) or (i) to (v), respectively, concerning the lubricant concentrate or the corresponding<br>
diluted (for example aqueous) use solutions, refer to the proportions of the respective<br>
components before the preparation of said concentrate or use solution, i.e. it is referred to the<br>
individual components as starting material (educts) before mixing them with each other. Due<br>
to the preparation of the lubricant concentrate (mixing of the individual components) it may<br>
happen that two or more of its components form partially or completely, for example, adducts<br>
such as salts. This may also depend on the presence of further components such as solvents,<br>
for example water. Such adducts of lubricant concentrates or diluted use solutions are also<br>
covered by scope of the present invention.<br>
Although the favourable effects according to the invention can already be realized with<br>
arbitrary proportions of the components (i) to (iii), the lubricant concentrate according to the<br>
invention shows exceptionally favourable effects when the components (i): (ii) are present in a<br>
proportion of 1 : 0.5 to 1 : 2, always calculated on basis of the weight of all the components (i)<br>
as well as (ii).<br>
Preferred is also a concentrate which is characterized that the components (i): (iii) are present<br>
in a proportion of 1 : 0.75 to 1 : 3, calculated on basis of the weight of all the components (i)<br>

As long as the proportion of amine to phosphate triester to the acid is within the mentioned<br>
range, excellent clear solubility will be obtained in an aqueous medium as well as an excellent<br>
22<br><br>
gliding property will be achieved compared to compositions without the addition of phosphate<br>
triester.<br>
The lubricant concentrate according to the invention contains the amine component (i) as a rule<br>

to 10 wt. % (i), 0.5 to 10 wt. % (ii), 0.5 to 10 wt. % (iii) and 70 to 98.5 wt. % (v), whereby all<br>
weight percentages are chosen such that a 100 % (wt / wt) concentrate will be obtained. In<br>
other preferred implementations the concentrate additionally contains - besides components (i)<br>
to (iii) with same portions - 0.5 to 10 wt. % (iv) and component (v) is 70 to 98 wt. % instead,<br>
whereby all weight percentages are chosen such that a 100 % (wt / wt) concentrate will be<br>
obtained.<br>

and (v) having the above definitions (of the last sentence).<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of the lubricant according to<br>
the invention.<br>
This is produced by mixing of the components (i), (ii) and (iii), possibly with addition of the<br>
components (iv) and (v). Water is preferred as component (v) thereby. Therefore, a further<br>

polyether;<br>
whereby component a) is diluted with component b) by a dilution factor of 2 to<br>
10,000.<br>
26<br><br>
According to the invention this lubricant solution (diluted use solution) can be obtained from<br>
the lubricant concentrate (component a)) according to the invention by means of dilution with<br>
a solvent (component b)) and a dilution factor of 2 to 10,000, preferably 100 to 2,000, more<br>
preferably with a factor 200 to 1,000; measured in volume % (vol.%).<br>
Preferably, the lubricant solution (diluted use solution) is an aqueous use solution. The<br>
dilution is obtained by employing at least one of the solvents listed as component b). The<br>
same definitions and examples apply to the individual solvents (component b)) of the<br>
lubricant solution as already indicated above in the corresponding section of component<br>
(v) of the lubricant concentrate. Preferably, component b) is water, a mixture of water<br>
with at least one further solvent of component b) or an alcohol, which is preferably<br>
ethanol, isopropanol or n-propanol. More preferably, component b) is water, optionally in<br>
combination with at least one further solvent of component b). It has to be indicated that it<br>
is possible to employ a lubricant concentrate, which does not contain any water, but one<br>
or more other components listed under component (v) instead, and said concentrate is<br>
diluted with water to obtain an aqueous use solution.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of lubricant concentrates according to the art<br>
described before as chain lubricant in the food industry, particularly for the lubricating and<br>
cleaning of feed and conveyance installation in the food industry, particularly automatic chain<br>
and belt lubrication installations. The present invention particularly relates to the use of the<br>
lubricant concentrates described before in the form of a 0.01 to 50 wt. %. Additionally, the<br>
present invention relates to use of phosphate triesters according to general formula (I) for<br>
lubricating and/or cleaning of feed and conveyance installations in the food industry. Preferably,<br>
the phosphate triester is contained in a lubricant concentrate, more preferably in a lubricant<br>
solution, most preferably in an aqueous use solution.<br>
This means that the present invention relates to the use of lubricant concentrates, preferably<br>
lubricant solutions, more preferably the aqueous use solution described before as a chain<br>
gliding and lubricating means suitable for lubricating and cleaning of feed and conveyance<br>
installations, in particular by means of immersion and/or automatic belt lubricating<br>
installations, in the food industry. The products according to the invention do not cause stress<br>
crack corrosion, in contrast to standard soap products, when applied with plastic objects, and<br>
therefore can be applied in particular without problems for PET or PC-objects. Accordingly,<br>
the lubricant solutions according to the invention can find use as chain lubricant for the feed or<br>
conveyance of objects or bottles made of glass, glass covered with a plastic layer, plastics, in<br>
particular polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC) or polyvinylchloride, tin plate<br>
27<br><br>
or aluminium, respectively varnished or plastic-layered containers made of these metals. The<br>
use thereby particularly relates to the filling up with foods, especially with beverages, of<br>
glass and plastic bottles, particularly in this case polyethylene terephthalate (PET),<br>
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polycarbonate (PC), boxes, metal cans, glasses,<br>
vessels, refillable cans, barrels or vessels, such as KEGs, beverage containers, paper and<br>
cardboard holders and the like.<br>
Therefore, the invention also relates to a process for the conveyance of beverage packings<br>
made of metal, glass, paper, cardboard and/or plastic, whereby a beverage conveyance device is<br>
contacted with a lubricating and cleaning amount of an aqueous use solution, as is defined<br>
herein.<br>
The products according to the invention show, compared to known lubricants, a considerably<br>
better tolerance to water chemistry in an aqueous medium as well as considerably better<br>
gliding properties. Therewith, the desired technical properties of the lubricant concentrate,<br>
respectively the aqueous lubricant solution, can be adjusted purposefully by the choice of the<br>
triester and/or the amine, respectively the anion of the amine.<br>
The following examples and comparative examples serve to present a more detailed<br>
explanation of the invention:<br>
I Methods<br>
a.) Friction coefficient<br>
The experiments for the measurement of the friction coefficient were performed on a<br>
bottle conveyor under the following conditions:<br>
-	6 glass bottles (0,5 litre) are placed on the test track.<br>
Friction force [Fz] is constantly measured via an electronic scales with A/D<br>
converter.<br><br>
- Spraying of the conveyor with a 0,3 wt. % lubricant solution.<br>
28<br>
-	The coefficient friction force [Fz] / weight of bottles [FN] represents the friction<br>
coefficient Ful which expresses the lubricity.<br><br>
Speed of the conveyor: approx. 0,4 m/s.<br>
- Phase time: 40 sec. spraying / 60 sec. non spraying<br>
Spraying performance per spray nozzle: approx. 4 litre / h<br>
Furthermore, the products were tested with hard water (16°dH) according to the provisions<br>
of DIN 53 902 and tested in completely desalinated water.<br>
The variance is a measure for the uniformity of lubricity or friction, respectively on the<br>
conveyor belt installations (tracks or chains), being determined from the noise of the<br>
friction coefficient measurements. A decreasing variance value relates to a more uniform<br>
lubrication on the tracks or chains. The time when the noise of the friction of the<br>
coefficient measurement is at a constant level indicates the starting point for transporting<br>
the beverage packings on the conveyor due the formation of uniform lubricating film.<br>
b.) Water compatibility<br>
The compositions to be applied according to the invention show an excellent water<br>
compatibility, which can be shown by the performed turbidity measurements<br>
(Nephelometer).<br>
Herewith, the regular removal of waste, which develops because of the reaction of ions,<br>
like sulphate, phosphate and carbonate, with the lubricant solution, can be prevented.<br>
For this propose 0,3 wt. % use solutions were measured over a period of 7 days (168<br>
hours). These experiments were performed in the following water conditions:<br><br>
Content		Concentration [mg/L]<br>
Sodium sulphate (Na2SO4)		148<br>
Sodium chloride (NaCl)		165<br>
Sodium hydrogen carbonate	(Na HCO3)	138<br>
Calcium chloride (CaCl x 2	H2O)	275<br>
The water compatibility is expressed in FNU (Formazine nephelometric units).<br>
0	to 1 FNU	= clear<br>
1	to 10 FNU	= weak, opalescent<br>
29<br><br>
10 to 50 FNU = turbidity<br>
50 to &gt; 100 FNU = strongly turbidity<br>
c.) Foam behaviour<br>
The foam behaviour was calculated according to the following method:<br>
100 ml of the use solution (0.3 %) was transferred into a 250 ml measuring cylinder. Thereafter<br>
it was shaken 30 times during 30 seconds and after a further 20 seconds the volume of the foam<br>
above the 100 ml mark was read off.<br>
d.) Material compatibility PET<br>
The material compacibility of the mixture according to the invention as well as a comparative<br>
example was examined in a test.<br>
For this, the following equipment was needed:<br>
Environmental camber:<br>
in each case 20 new PET bottles (1.5 L) in crates, CO2-cylinder with fitting reducing valve,<br>
attachment for filling of the bottles with CO2, separate manometer for testing the bottles with<br>
regard to CO2;<br>
The tests were executed in the following manner:<br>
At first, the bottles were filed with 1.5 L VE-water, thereafter 3.0-3.1 bar CO2 was led into<br>
the bottles via an attachment. Then the quantity of CO2 was dissolved into the water by means<br>
of shaking. All CO2 was considered to be dissolved only after the test manometer indicated 0<br>
bar.<br>
1.) The bottles were now dipped shortly into concentrated belt lubricant (BSM) (~ 2 cm) and<br>
thereafter allowed to stand for 24 hours.<br>
2.) Thereafter the bottles were filled in crates and allowed to stand in a climatic cabinet at 38<br>
°C and 85 % relative humidity for 6 days.<br>
As reference a bottle was taken along in each crate which was not dipped into BDM.<br>
At the end of the test a visual estimation was made. Here, 5 categories are distinguished.<br>
O: No damages<br>
30<br><br>
A: Minor damages<br>
B: Moderate, superficial cracks<br>
C: Multiple, moderately deep cracks<br>
D: Multiple, deep cracks<br>
31<br><br><br><br>
From the above table it can be seen that each of the lubricant concentrates according to<br>
the present invention shows at least comparable, most embodiments an enhanced<br>
lubricity compared with lubricant concentrates according to the state of the art.<br>
Additionally, they are stable as clear solutions and provide more uniforms lubrication<br>
on tracks and chains of feed and conveyance installation in food industry due to the<br>
improved variance.<br>
