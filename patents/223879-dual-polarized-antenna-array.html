				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Dual-polarized antenna array<br>
The invention relates to a dual-polarized antenna array<br>
as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
Dual-polarized antennas are preferably used in the<br>
mobile radio field for 800 MHz to 1000 MHz, and in the<br>
band from 1700 MHz to 2200 MHz. The antenna each<br>
transmit and receive two orthogonal polarizations. In<br>
particular, the use of two linear polarizations aligned<br>
at +45° and -45° with respect to the vertical or<br>
horizontal have been proven in practice. Dual-polarized<br>
antennas aligned in this way are also frequently<br>
referred to as X-polarized antennas. In order to<br>
optimize the illumination of the supply area, without<br>
needing to mechanically depress the antenna, the polar<br>
diagram is depressed electrically by changing the phase<br>
angles of the individual antenna elements of the<br>
antenna array. This is done using phase shifters which,<br>
owing to the stringent intermodulation requirements and<br>
the high transmission power levels, are preferably in<br>
the form of mechanically moving structures with<br>
variable line lengths. Phase shifters such as these are<br>
known, for example, from DE 199 38 862 Cl.<br>
Although the possibility of depressing the antenna to<br>
different extents by varying the phase angles of the<br>
individual antenna elements is intrinsically very<br>
highly advantageous for adaptation of the illumination<br>
in situ, it has been found to be disadvantageous in the<br>
case of antennas having a polarization of +/- 45°,<br>
however, that varying the depression of the vertical<br>
polar diagram, that is to say varying the phase angles<br>
, of the individual antenna elements, shifts the<br>
horizontal polar diagrams for the respective<br>
polarization through an angle in azimuth.<br>
In this case, it has been found to be particularly<br>
disadvantageous that, when the vertical polar diagram<br>
depression is changed, the horizontal polar diagrams<br>
for the respective polarization are not only shifted<br>
but that, particularly when the vertical polar diagram<br>
is depressed, the horizontal polar diagrams for the<br>
+ 45° polarization and for the -45° polarization are<br>
shifted through an azimuth angle in the opposite<br>
directions to one another. This drifting apart from one<br>
another in opposite directions for the +45°<br>
polarization to the -45° polarization can be explained,<br>
inter alia, by the fact that the radiation<br>
characteristic of the individual antenna elements is<br>
not rotationally symmetrical with respect to the main<br>
lobe direction. In other words, the polar diagram of<br>
the individual antenna elements in most cases is no<br>
longer exactly symmetrical with respect to the vertical<br>
axis due to the specific configuration of the<br>
polarization of +45° on the one hand and -45° on the<br>
other hand. If any axis of symmetry were to be present<br>
at all, it would preferably intrinsically run aligned<br>
at +/- 45° with respect to individual groups of antenna<br>
elements. When the main lobe direction of the antenna<br>
array is depressed electrically, this now results,<br>
however, in the main lobe direction being shifted,<br>
which is also referred to as tracking. This thus<br>
results in the polar diagram being undesirably<br>
dependent on respectively selected depression angles.<br>
The problem which has been explained occurs exclusively<br>
in the case of polarizations aligned at oblique angles,<br>
that is to say primarily in the case, of polarizations<br>
which are aligned at +45° and -45° with respect to the<br>
horizontal or vertical.<br>
Against the background of this prior art, the present<br>
invention is based on the object of improving a dual-<br>
polarized single-band, dual-band and/or multiband<br>
antenna array such that, with a depression angle which<br>
can be set differently, it is possible to compensate<br>
better for, or even to prevent, the polarization-<br>
dependent polar diagrams drifting apart from one<br>
another.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved on<br>
the basis of the features specified in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
It must be regarded as being rather surprising that,<br>
according to ' the present invention, this makes it<br>
possible for the first time not only to set the<br>
depression angle of a dual-polarized antenna array<br>
differently but to reduce, or even completely to avoid,<br>
the individual radiation characteristics for the +45°<br>
polarization and for the -45° polarization drifting<br>
apart from one another as a function of the depression<br>
angle, which can be preset to be different.<br>
According to the invention, this can be achieved by<br>
also providing a compensation device in addition to the<br>
individual antenna element arrangements which, for<br>
example, are arranged one above the other with a<br>
vertical offset and transmit and receive using two<br>
polarizations which are orthogonal to one another, for<br>
example +45° and -45°. According to the invention, this<br>
compensation device is constructed such that it<br>
comprises additional antenna elements or antenna<br>
element arrangements, whose polar diagrams do not<br>
overall drift apart from one another in the azimuth<br>
direction when the vertical polar diagram of the<br>
antenna array is depressed but, conversely, are shifted<br>
in the opposite sense relative to this. This therefore<br>
results in an overall polar diagram in which, despite<br>
the down-tilt angle being increasingly depressed, that<br>
is despite the increasingly greater depression of the<br>
vertical polar diagram, the drifting apart of the<br>
horizontal components of the polar diagram in the<br>
azimuth angle direction is minimized, or even<br>
prevented. If required, it would even be possible to<br>
provide overcompensation, in which case it would be<br>
feasible to provide even a slight angle change in the<br>
opposite sense for the horizontal polar diagrams for<br>
the +45° to the -45° polarization.<br>
One preferred implementation of the invention provides<br>
for the compensation device for the relevant<br>
polarization to in each case comprise at least one pair<br>
of dipole antenna elements or at least one pair of feed<br>
points for at least one patch antenna element, which<br>
are arranged at least horizontally offset with respect<br>
to one another (and possibly also vertically in<br>
addition) , and which are in this case fed with a phase<br>
difference which is dependent on the depression angle<br>
of the antenna array. This can preferably be produced<br>
by means of a phase shifter assembly located in the<br>
antenna.<br>
It may be regarded as being particularly advantageous<br>
that it is also possible, in a development of the<br>
invention, to control the compensation level as well,<br>
in order to avoid tracking. The control process may in<br>
this case be carried out by splitting the power which<br>
is fed to the individual antenna elements.<br>
The invention may be implemented using different<br>
antenna element types. In this case, furthermore, not<br>
only corresponding individual antenna elements but also<br>
group antenna elements may be used by an antenra array<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The antenna array may therefore, for example, comprise<br>
a number of cruciform dipoles or cruciform-like dipole<br>
structures arranged vertically one above the other. The<br>
individual antenna element arrangements which are<br>
arranged vertically one above the other may likewise<br>
all or in some cases comprise dipole squares or dipole<br>
structures similar to dipole squares. It is equally<br>
possible for the invention to be implemented entirely<br>
or partially using patch antenna elements which, for<br>
example, are provided with a feed structure which<br>
comprises two feed points or four feed points, in which<br>
case the relevant polarizations can be received or<br>
transmitted at angles of +45° and -45°.<br>
Thus, in other words, individual antenna elements which<br>
by way of example are located such that they are<br>
horizontally offset, or antenna element groups in the<br>
antenna array which are located such that they are<br>
offset horizontally can be compensated for with respect<br>
to one another in order to avoid tracking when their<br>
emission angle is depressed, by choosing different<br>
phase angles for at least two antenna elements, which<br>
are located horizontally offset with respect to one<br>
another, as a function of the elevation angle or<br>
depression angle.<br>
If, for example, square antenna element structures,<br>
that is to say in particular square dipole structures<br>
in the form of a dipole square, are used, then this<br>
antenna element arrangement comprises two individual<br>
antenna elements, which have a horizontal offset with<br>
respect to one another, for each polarization when<br>
aligned to receive and to transmit polarizations at<br>
angles of +45° and -45°. In this case, the pairs of<br>
mutually aligned dipole antenna elements in a dipole<br>
square may be driven with a phase difference which is<br>
dependent on the depression angle of the antenna array<br>
in order to produce the desired compensation effect.<br>
This may be done, for example, by the antenna array<br>
having only one such dipole square which is used for<br>
compensation, or having a number of such dipole<br>
squares. This can be implemented in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner by an antenna array according to<br>
the invention comprising, for example, two dipole<br>
squares which are arranged vertically one above the<br>
other, with the respectively parallel adjacent dipoles<br>
of the two dipole squares which are arranged vertically<br>
one above the other being connected together in phase,<br>
that is to say at least being connected together with a<br>
fixed phase relationship between them, and with the<br>
respective further dipoles which are parallel to them<br>
in the relevant dipole square being fed with different<br>
phase angles as a function of the depression angle.<br>
A solution which is comparable to this extent may also<br>
be obtained by using patch antenna elements which, for<br>
example, each comprise pairs of interacting feed points<br>
for each of the two polarizations.<br>
However, the invention may also be used for other<br>
antenna structures, for example using cruciform antenna<br>
elements (dipole cruciforms or patch antenna elements<br>
with cruciform antenna element structures) . There, the<br>
respectively parallel individual antenna elements are<br>
admittedly provided with different components offset<br>
only in the vertical direction and possibly not in the<br>
horizontal direction. However, in this case, but of<br>
course also in the other abovementioned cases, :.t is at<br>
least possible to use additional antenna elements which<br>
are arranged with a lateral, horizontal offset. Hence,<br>
a further development of the invention provides for<br>
additional antenna elements to be provided in addition<br>
to the other antenna elements which are arranged one<br>
above the other, which additional antenna elements are<br>
located offset at least horizontally and in this case<br>
preferably symmetrically with respect to a vertical<br>
axis of symmetry or plane of symmetry, with the<br>
relevant antenna elements for each polarization being<br>
electrically connected to the associated output of a<br>
phase shifter assembly. This also results in a<br>
completely novel type of compensation according to the<br>
invention which allows the illumination areas to drift<br>
apart from one another when the vertical polar diagram<br>
is depressed electrically.<br>
The additional antenna elements which are used for the<br>
compensation device may thus be produced from dipole<br>
structures which are arranged with a horizontal offset,<br>
in particular individual dipoles for example in the<br>
form of a cruciform or square dipole structure, or from<br>
a patch antenna element with at least two feed points<br>
or two pairs of feed points for each of the two<br>
polarizations. Furthermore, however, it is even<br>
possible to use vertically aligned individual antenna<br>
elements which are arranged in pairs with a horizontal<br>
offset, preferably with respect to a vertical central<br>
plane of symmetry, with each pair of vertically aligned<br>
individual antenna elements, or a corresponding pair of<br>
patch antenna elements, being provided for each of the<br>
polarizations that are to be compensated in a<br>
corresponding manner.<br>
In summary, it can thus be stated that the antenna<br>
array may comprise widely differing antenna elements<br>
and antenna element arrangements whose polar diagrams<br>
normally drift apart from one another as the polar<br>
diagram is depressed to an increasingly greater extent<br>
in the horizontal direction, and hence in the azimuth<br>
direction, and that, according to the invention,<br>
compensation devices are provided which are formed from<br>
widely differing antenna elements, antenna element<br>
arrangements or group antenna elements, and whose<br>
individual antenna elements or feed points of a patch<br>
antenna element can be driven with different phase<br>
angles so as to counteract their polar diagrams<br>
drifting apart from one another, so as to reduce or<br>
even prevent such drifting apart and, if required, even<br>
to overcompensate for it. The compensation level can be<br>
set or preselected as appropriate by means of the<br>
number of antenna elements associated with the<br>
compensation device and, above all, by the power<br>
splitting which can be carried out in a corresponding<br>
manner.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the<br><br>
following text using accompanying drawings which provide a<br>
comparison with a dual-polarized antenna array as is<br>
known from the prior art. In this case, in detail:<br>
Figure 1 shows a first exemplary embodiment of an<br>
antenna array according to the invention<br>
having a square antenna element structure;<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment that is<br>
modified from that shown in Figure 1, in<br>
order to explain an antenna array which is<br>
known from the prior art, in order to<br>
illustrate the differences from an antenna<br>
array according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment which<br>
corresponds in principle to that shown in<br>
Figure 1, in which antenna elements in the<br>
form of patch antenna elements with a square<br>
antenna element structure are used instead of<br>
antenna elements in the form of dipole<br>
squares;<br>
Figure 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment, with<br>
additional antenna elements in order to avoid<br>
tracking;<br>
Figure 5 shows an antenna array with a cruciform<br>
antenna element structure with additional<br>
antenna elements with a horizontal offset in<br>
order to avoid tracking;<br>
Figure 6 shows a further exemplary embodiment, with<br>
additional antenna elements in the form of<br>
vertical antenna elements in order to avoid<br>
tracking; and<br>
Figure 7 shows a simplified exemplary embodiment,<br>
which has once again been modified from that<br>
shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a dual-polarized antenna array according<br>
to the invention. This comprises a large number of<br>
individual antenna elements 13 in front of a vertically<br>
aligned reflector 11, with four individual antenna<br>
elements 13 in each case forming a dipole square 15 in<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiment. According to the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 1, four dipole<br>
squares 15 are arranged one above the other, fitted in<br>
the vertical direction, in front of the reflector 11.<br>
The individual antenna elements 13 in this case<br>
comprise dipole antenna elements, which are each<br>
arranged at an angle of +45° or -45° with respect to<br>
the vertical or horizontal, so that it is also possible<br>
to refer to this as a short X-polarized antenna array.<br>
Figure 1 shows that, by way of example, the individual<br>
antenna element 3a, which is aligned at an angle of<br>
+45° to the horizontal, of the second dipole square 15,<br>
counting from the top, is connected via a line 19 and<br>
via an addition point 21 and a feed line 23 to an<br>
associated input 24 of a phase shifter assembly 27. The<br>
corresponding dipole 3b of the dipole square 15 located<br>
underneath this and which is aligned parallel to the<br>
dipole 3a of the dipole square located above it (at an<br>
angle of +45° to the horizontal) is arranged offset<br>
horizontally with respect to this dipole 3a, seen in<br>
the horizontal direction. This dipole 3b is also<br>
connected via a corresponding line 19, the connection<br>
point 21 and the subsequent line 23 to the input 24 of<br>
the phase shifter assembly 27, that is to say it is<br>
connected to the common feed network line 31.<br>
The two parallel dipole antenna elements 3a and 3b<br>
which have been explained in the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment are those which are located closer to one<br>
another with respect to the two central dipole squares<br>
15, individual antenna elements 3'a and 3'b, which<br>
likewise are parallel to them, of the two central<br>
dipole squares 15.<br>
The phase shifter assembly 27 in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment comprises two integrated phase<br>
shifters 27' and 27" so that appropriate phase shifts<br>
can be produced via a common feed network line 31 and a<br>
phase shifter adjustment element 33 which can be<br>
rotated in the form of a vector, thus making it<br>
possible to set depression angles of different<br>
magnitude, for example between 2° and 8°. For this<br>
purpose, the two first parallel dipoles, which are<br>
arranged at an angle of +45° with respect to the<br>
horizontal, are associated with the output 27"a via a<br>
line 43 and an addition point 25 while, in contrast,<br>
the other output 27"b is likewise electrically<br>
connected to the two dipoles 13, which are aligned at<br>
an angle of +45° to the horizontal, of the lowermost<br>
dipole square 15, via a subsequent line 43' and a<br>
downstream addition point 25' and subsequent lines.<br>
With regard to other aspects of the design and. method<br>
of operation, reference is made to the prior<br>
publication DE 199 38 862, which is included in the<br>
content of this application.<br>
The dipole 3'a, which is parallel to the dipole 3a, is<br>
connected to the one output 27'a, and the dipole 3'b,<br>
which is associated with the third dipole square and is<br>
parallel to the dipole 3b, is connected to the second<br>
input 27'b via a corresponding line.<br>
In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the feed line<br>
31 is furthermore connected not only to the phase<br>
shifter adjustment element 33 but, branching off from<br>
there, via an addition or division point 21 and two<br>
branch lines 19, which originate from there, firstly to<br>
the dipole 3a (which is aligned at an angle of 45°) of<br>
the second dipole square 15, and secondly to the dipole<br>
3b, which is parallel to this, of the third dipole<br>
square, counting from the top.<br>
If the polar diagram is now intended to be depressed,<br>
then the phase shifter adjustment element 33 is<br>
adjusted appropriately. In consequence, the two<br>
parallel dipoles 13, which are aligned at an angle of<br>
+ 45°, in the uppermost dipole square 15 and in the<br>
lowermost dipole square 15 are fed with different<br>
phases via the two associated outputs of the phase<br>
shifter 27". The dipole 3'a of the second dipole square<br>
and the dipole 3'b, which is parallel to it but is<br>
horizontally offset with respect to it, of the third<br>
dipole square, are also fed with different phases by<br>
the further phase shifter 27'. The parallel dipoles 3a<br>
and 3b, which are connected to the feed line 31 via the<br>
common branch lines 19, of the second and third dipole<br>
squares are fed with the same phase angle, without any<br>
change. As a result, the dipole antenna element group<br>
two and three, that is to say the respectively parallel<br>
dipoles in the second and third dipole squares (that is<br>
to say the two central dipole squares in Figure 1), are<br>
now thus fed with different phase angles with respect<br>
to one another as a function of the depression angle of<br>
the antenna array, thus resulting in the desired<br>
compensation. This is because the second and third<br>
dipole squares now produce respective polar diagrams<br>
which do not drift away from one another in the azimuth<br>
direction overall as the depression angle of the polar<br>
diagram of the antenna array becomes greater, but are<br>
adjusted in the opposite direction, that is to say<br>
producing the desired compensation. Furthermore, the<br>
desired level of compensation can be adjusted by<br>
appropriate power splitting in the phase shifter<br>
assembly 27.<br>
The compensation device or compensation arrangement<br>
that has been explained makes it possible to counteract<br>
the undesirable drifting apart from one another when<br>
the main lobes of the antenna array are depressed.<br>
Without using the solution according to the invention,<br>
the horizontal polar diagram or azimuth polar diagram<br>
for one polarization and the other polarization would,<br>
as stated, otherwise drift apart from one another in<br>
the horizontal or azimuth direction. In this case,<br>
furthermore, it should also be noted that the<br>
horizontal polar diagram is normally measured as a<br>
section through the main lobe, that is to say in the<br>
main lobe direction. In consequence, a conical section<br>
is produced when the main lobe is electrically<br>
depressed.<br>
The exemplary embodiment explained so far also shows<br>
that the compensation device or compensation<br>
arrangement which has been explained can, according to<br>
the invention, be implemented both partially and on its<br>
own by corresponding antenna elements of the antenna<br>
array being interconnected in a completely novel manner<br>
in order to counteract this drifting apart.<br>
The corresponding design and the corresponding method<br>
of operation have been explained for the dipoles<br>
aligned at an angle of +45°. The design for all the<br>
further dipoles, which are aligned at an angle of -45°,<br>
of the individual dipole squares is furthermore<br>
correspondingly symmetrical with respect to a phase<br>
shifter assembly 127, which is also shown on the left<br>
in Figure 1, with an inner phase shifter 127' and an<br>
outer phase shifter 127", as well as a common feed<br>
network line 131. The two dipole antenna elements 3c<br>
and 3d which are aligned at an angle of -45° are thus<br>
connected via a common connecting line 119 and by a<br>
common addition point via a subsequent line 123 to the<br>
input 124 of the further phase shifter assembly 127, to<br>
which the common feed network line 131 leads. The<br>
further individual antenna elements 3'c and 3'd which<br>
are respectively parallel to the further individual<br>
antenna elements 3c and 3d, which are adjacent to one<br>
another and have already been mentioned, are connected<br>
in a comparable manner to the individual antenna<br>
elements 3'a and 3'b to the phase shifter assembly 127.<br>
This also results in the respective two parallel pairs<br>
of individual dipoles of the second and third dipole<br>
square which are aligned at -45° being fed with a phase<br>
difference which is dependent on the depression angle<br>
of the antenna and which is produced by the phase<br>
shifter assembly located in the antenna. The second and<br>
third phase shifter assemblies thus form the desired<br>
compensation device for varying the way in which the<br>
polar diagrams drift apart from one another when the<br>
polar diagrams are depressed. Conversely, of course,<br>
the desired half beam-width is also maintained and is<br>
not changed when the polar diagram is raised.<br>
A dual-polarized antenna array which is known from the<br>
prior art will now be described with reference to<br>
Figure 2, in order once again to explain the<br>
differences from the antenna array according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The antenna array shown in Figure 2 now relates to an<br>
antenna array which is known from the prior art. This<br>
differs from the antenna array according to the<br>
invention and as illustrated in Figure 1 in that not<br>
only the two outer dipole squares are still connected<br>
to one another as shown in Figure 1, that is to say in<br>
each case two parallel dipoles 13 for the +45°<br>
polarization are thus likewise permanently connected to<br>
one another in the same way as for the -45°<br>
polarization, but that now also, in the case of the<br>
central dipole squares, the respective two pairs of<br>
parallel dipoles are fed via a common feed line, that<br>
is to say with the same phase angle, or are fed with a<br>
phase angle with respect to one another which, although<br>
different, is predetermined in a fixed mariner and<br>
cannot be varied while the polar diagram is depressed.<br>
Thus, in this exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 2,<br>
the two parallel dipoles 3a and 3'a are jointly<br>
connected to one input 27'a of the phase shifter<br>
assembly. The two dipoles 3b and 3'b, which are<br>
likewise aligned parallel to one another, in the next<br>
antenna element group located underneath this, that is<br>
to say in the next antenna element square located<br>
underneath this, are also interconnected via the line<br>
23" and are conductively connected to the other output<br>
of the same phase shifter group 27' . Thus, in the case<br>
of this antenna array according to the prior art, each<br>
of the four antenna element arrangements shown, that is<br>
to say each of the four antenna element groups which<br>
are arranged one above the other and are formed from a<br>
dipole square, are set only with respect to one<br>
another, that is to say with respect to a next antenna<br>
element group of a different phase angle via the phase<br>
shifter assembly so that as a result, overall, only the<br>
depression angle can be varied electrically. However,<br>
this results in the undesirable drifting apart of the<br>
polar diagrams in the horizontal or azimuth direction.<br>
These disadvantages also occur when the respective<br>
dipoles which are fed jointly in pairs are no longer<br>
fed with identical phase angles, but possibly with<br>
phase angles which, although different, are preset such<br>
that they are fixed with respect to one another.<br>
Merely to assist clarity, Figure 2 does not show the<br>
phase shifter assembly 27 that is required for the<br>
second polarization, or the associated feed lines for<br>
the other polarization. However, to this extent, the<br>
design is identical.<br>
The following text refers to the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to the invention as shown in Figure 3, which<br>
largely corresponds to that shown in Figure 1, but with<br>
the difference that individual antenna elements in the<br>
form of patch antenna elements 15' are used, as the<br>
antenna elements, rather than dipoles 13 joined<br>
together in the form of dipole squares. The individual<br>
or patch antenna elements 15' in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 3 are designed<br>
such that they each have two pairs of feed points 13'<br>
which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, are<br>
provided on corresponding slots, which are aligned in<br>
pairs parallel to one another. The individual or patch<br>
antenna elements 15' are in this case designed such<br>
that they transmit or receive at an angle of +45° and<br>
at an angle of -45° with respect to the vertical, to<br>
the extent that, functionally, they are comparable to<br>
the dipole squares shown in Figure 2.<br>
With reference to the two central patch antenna<br>
elements 15' with a square structure, the<br>
correspondingly positioned feed points 13 ' are likewise<br>
once again connected such that, with respect to the two<br>
central patch antenna elements 15' (which are aligned<br>
at an angle of +45° to the horizontal), the feed point<br>
3'a is electrically connected to the first output 27'a,<br>
and the feed point 3'b, which is located offset with<br>
respect to this in the vertical and horizontal<br>
directions, of the third patch antenna element 15' is<br>
electrically connected to the second, with respect to<br>
this, output 27'b of the phase shifter 27', with the<br>
feed points 3b and 3a which transmit or receive using<br>
the same polarization once again being electrically<br>
interconnected via a common connecting line 19 and<br>
being electrically connected from a common connection<br>
point 21 via a subsequent line 23 to the corresponding<br>
input of the phase shifter assembly 27, and hence to<br>
the feed network line 31. A further phase shifter<br>
assembly 127 is provided in this exemplary embodiment<br>
as well, and is required for the feed points provided<br>
for the other polarizations. To this extent, the design<br>
once again corresponds to this.<br>
In this case as well, the two central individual or<br>
patch antenna elements 15' are used as a compensation<br>
device, in which the respective pairs of interacting<br>
feed points 3'a and 3a or 3b and 3'b are fed with a<br>
phase difference which is dependent on the depression<br>
angle of the antenna, and which is produced by the<br>
phase shifter assembly located in the antenna.<br>
Furthermore, the compensation level can once again be<br>
set and finely adjusted by means of the power splitting<br>
which is possible via the phase shifter assembly 27.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4 is<br>
fundamentally based on the same principle as that shown<br>
in Figure 1 or Figure 3. However, in this exemplary<br>
embodiment, additional antenna elements 315 are used to<br>
compensate for tracking, and cause the polar diagram to<br>
be swiveled horizontally as a function of the<br>
depression angle. In the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 4, four patch antenna elements 15' are used,<br>
which each have feed points 13' that interact in pairs<br>
for one of the two orthogonal polarizations. The feed<br>
points 13', which are opposite one another in pairs,<br>
are in each case permanently connected to one another<br>
as shown in Figures 1 and 3 for the outermost patch<br>
antenna elements 15' that are illustrated there. In<br>
this case, the feed points 13' (which are shown in<br>
Figure 4) of the uppermost and lowermost patch antenna<br>
element 15' are each electrically connected via<br>
corresponding respective lines 43 and 43' to the<br>
respective inputs 27"a and 27"b of one phase shifter<br>
assembly 27", and the parallel feed points 13' of the<br>
two central patch antenna elements 15', which are<br>
adjacent to one another, are electrically connected via<br>
respective separate lines 143 and 143' to the two<br>
respective inputs 27'a and 27'b of the further phase<br>
shifter assembly 27'. This exemplary embodiment that<br>
has been explained to this extent corresponds to an<br>
antenna array as has been explained with reference to<br>
Figure 2 and which is known from the prior art but<br>
which, in contrast to Figure 2, is not designed using<br>
dipole structures but using patch antenna elements.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4,<br>
however, a feed for an additionally provided cruciform<br>
dipole or for a slot antenna element or patch antenna<br>
element 215 is now connected to the respective input<br>
27"a or 27"b of the phase shifter 27" via a respective<br>
additional line 47.1 or 47.2. These two additional<br>
antenna elements 215 - assuming that they are in the<br>
form of dipole cruciforms - thus comprise two dipole<br>
antenna elements 13 which are aligned at an angle of<br>
+45° to the horizontal, and two dipole antenna elements<br>
13 which are aligned at an angle of -45° to the<br>
horizontal. However, patch antenna elements 215', for<br>
example, may also be used instead of dipole cruciforms<br>
215, and comprise feed points 13' in order to transmit<br>
and to receive with a polarization of +45° and with a<br>
polarization of -45°. In both cases, this ensures that<br>
the antenna array comprises individual antenna elements<br>
13 which are horizontally offset and feed points 13'<br>
which are horizontally offset (to be precise with<br>
respect to the +45° polarization and with respect to<br>
the -45° polarization), so that the desired<br>
compensation effect can be achieved as in the case of<br>
the other exemplary embodiments that have been<br>
explained. In this exemplary embodiment as well, the<br>
additional antenna elements 215 and 21.5' are once again<br>
arranged symmetrically with respect to the vertical<br>
axis of symmetry 245.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment as well, the further phase<br>
shifter assembly 127 with the two phase shifters 127'<br>
and 127" as well as the associated connecting lines to<br>
the further individual antenna elements 15' and to the<br>
antenna element arrangements for the compensation<br>
device for the -45° polarization have been omitted in<br>
order to make the illustration clearer, and reference<br>
should in this context be made to the comparable design<br>
as has been explained with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Thus, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4,<br>
the compensation device comprises additional antenna<br>
element arrangements which are arranged offset, in the<br>
horizontal direction and which, for example, may be<br>
formed from cruciform dipole structures 215, square<br>
dipole structures, or else from patch antenna elements<br>
215' each having one feed point for both polarizations,<br>
or each having a pair of feed points for each<br>
polarization. Slotted antenna elements are also in<br>
principle suitable for this purpose.<br>
The corresponding feed is provided via lines 47.1 and<br>
47.2, so that these individual antenna elements or feed<br>
points are likewise once again fed with a phase<br>
difference which is dependent on the depression angle<br>
of the antenna. In this case as well, the phase<br>
difference can be produced by the phase shifter<br>
assembly that is located in the antenna.<br>
Figure 5 will be used to show how the principle<br>
according to the invention is fundamentally used not<br>
only for antenna elements with a square antenna element<br>
structure (that is to say, for example, a dipole square<br>
corresponding to Figure 1 or patch antenna elements<br>
each having pairs of interacting feed points 13' as<br>
shown in Figure 4) but also for cruciform dipole<br>
antenna elements 115 (for example dipole cruciforms) or<br>
patch antenna elements 115' with a cruciform antenna<br>
element structure (in the form of in each case one feed<br>
point for each polarization) which, from the start, may<br>
be arranged for example only in the vertical direction,<br>
and not with any horizontal offset with respect to one<br>
another.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment as shown in Figure 5 as<br>
well, the additional antenna elements 215, 215' make it<br>
possible to provide the desired compensation when the<br>
polar diagram is depressed, in order to avoid the polar<br>
diagrams drifting apart from one another, in accordance<br>
with the explained tracking process.<br>
For this purpose, in the case of this exemplary<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 5 and in contrast to an<br>
antenna array as known from the prior art with<br>
cruciform dipole structures 115 or patch antenna<br>
elements 115' arranged only one above the other in a<br>
vertical alignment (which will also be referred to for<br>
short as cruciform antenna elements in the following<br>
text) , provision is made for, for example, two<br>
compensation antenna element arrangements 215 and 215',<br>
which are arranged alongside one another with a<br>
horizontal offset, now to be provided instead of two<br>
cruciform antenna elements, which are arranged one<br>
above the other vertically, in the center of the<br>
antenna array. In this case, the two dipole antenna<br>
elements 203a and 203b, which are aligned parallel and<br>
at an angle of +45° to the horizontal, are connected<br>
via respective lines 223a and 223b to the respective<br>
output 27'a or 27'b of the inner phase shifter assembly<br>
27'. The respectively parallel dipoles (which are<br>
aligned at an angle of -45° in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment) of the dipole cruciforms 215, or<br>
the corresponding patch antenna elements 215' of the<br>
compensation antenna elements, are in each case<br>
connected in pairs (that is to say with respect to the<br>
two upper and the two lower antenna element structures<br>
in Figure 5) to a phase shifter assembly which is<br>
provided separately for this purpose. The same applies<br>
to the -45° alignment of the individual antenna<br>
elements of the two additional antenna element<br>
arrangements 215 and 215', which are likewise connected<br>
to a separate phase shifter assembly. The design is in<br>
this case once again largely symmetrical with respect<br>
to the exemplary embodiment, only part of which is<br>
illustrated in Figure 5, as has been explained<br>
elsewhere with reference to Figure 1.<br>
A corresponding electrical connection is provided for<br>
the respective dipoles that are aligned with the other<br>
polarization via a further phase shifter assembly,<br>
which is not shown in Figure 5 but is located on the<br>
left and corresponds to the exemplary embodiment shown<br>
in Figure 1. The two central dipoles 203c and 203d,<br>
which are provided with a horizontal offset and are<br>
aligned at an angle of -45°, are also electrically fed<br>
in a corresponding symmetrical manner via this phase<br>
shifter assembly.<br>
In this case as well, patch antenna elements 215' could<br>
thus be used instead of the cruciform dipole structures<br>
115, as has been explained with reference to Figure 3.<br>
In this case, for an antenna array as shown in Figure<br>
5, the additional compensation antenna elements 215,<br>
215' which are provided with a horizontal offset may be<br>
formed, in contrast to Figure 5, not only with a<br>
cruciform antenna element structure (cruciform or<br>
square dipole structure), but it would also be possible<br>
to use patch antenna elements, each having two pairs of<br>
feed points as shown in Figure 3 or 4, as compensation<br>
antenna elements. The compensation device shown in<br>
Figure 5 with the two antenna element arrangements 215<br>
and 215' which are arranged offset in the horizontal<br>
direction is thus to this extent designed such that it<br>
is comparable to the compensation device shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
In contrast to the preceding exemplary embodiments, it<br>
should be noted that the additional antenna elements<br>
which are provided with a horizontal offset do not;<br>
necessarily need to have the same polarization as the<br>
individual antenna elements 13. This means that it is<br>
also feasible to use vertically polarized antenna<br>
elements for this purpose. In this case, separate<br>
additional antenna elements must then be provided, for<br>
example, in order to compensate for the +4 5°<br>
polarization and the -45° polarization, and must be<br>
connected or coupled to a variable phase feed path,<br>
preferably by means of a suitable constellation or<br>
other coupling elements such as directional couplers<br>
for example.<br>
In this context, Figure 6 shows a corresponding<br>
exemplary embodiment, in which the antenna array<br>
fundamentally comprises only cruciform antenna elements<br>
115, which are arranged one above the other with a<br>
vertical offset, that is to say with the individual<br>
dipole antenna elements 13 which are aligned parallel<br>
to one another not having any horizontal lateral offset<br>
with respect to one another. Instead of the dipole<br>
cruciforms 13 or the cruciform dipole structures, it<br>
also possible, however, to use square dipole structures<br>
(dipole squares) or corresponding patch antenna<br>
elements 13'. The invention can be implemented in the<br>
same way in all these examples if compensation or<br>
additional antenna elements 415, which are also<br>
arranged with a horizontal offset, are likewise once<br>
again provided in addition to the antenna elements,<br>
antenna element arrangements or antenna element groups<br>
that are arranged vertically one above the other. This<br>
examplary embodiment in this case relates to vertical<br>
antenna elements 415, with vertical antenna elements<br>
415 in each case being provided in pairs, and in this<br>
case a vertical antenna element 415 on the one hand<br>
being provided on the left, when the antenna array<br>
shown in Figure 6 is viewed from the front, and a<br>
further vertical antenna element 415 on the other hand<br>
being arranged on the right of the vertical plane of<br>
symmetry 245, in each case aligned vertically, and with<br>
these two antenna elements in this case being connected<br>
to the two inputs of an associated phase shifter<br>
assembly 27' . Furthermore, a second pair of vertical<br>
antenna elements 416 are provided, with the two<br>
associated individual vertical antenna elements being<br>
arranged such that they are aligned vertically and<br>
symmetrically with respect to the central vertical axis<br>
or plane 245, to be precise underneath the first<br>
antenna element pair 415 when viewed in a vertical<br>
alignment. These second vertical antenna elements 415<br>
are then also connected via appropriate lines to an<br>
associated phase shifter assembly 127', that is to say<br>
to the two associated outputs of this phase shifter<br>
assembly 127', via which the individual antenna<br>
elements or dipole antenna elements which are aligned<br>
at -45° are fed. This exemplary embodiment can also<br>
once again be used in an appropriate manner for patch<br>
antenna elements 415, as well.<br>
Figure 7 will now be used as a basis for explaining<br>
how, in principle, one compensation device with only<br>
one compensation antenna element arrangement may also<br>
be adequate. In principle, Figure 7 corresponds to the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 1, but with the<br>
only difference being that only one dipole square 15 is<br>
provided instead of two central dipole squares which<br>
are associated with the compensation device. As shown<br>
in Figure 7, the two respectively parallel dipoles 13,<br>
that is to say the dipoles 3a and 3'a, are fed with<br>
different phases depending on the depression angle of<br>
the polar diagram, for which purpose these two parallel<br>
dipoles are connected to the two inputs 27'a and 27'b.<br>
The two dipoles, which are arranged offset through 90°<br>
for this purpose, are then connected to a further phase<br>
shifter assembly 127, in a corresponding manner, as<br>
explained in principle in Figure 1, for the second<br>
polarization. However, in this exemplary embodiment,<br>
the phase shifter assembly is not likewise used in an<br>
optimal manner as in the case of Figure 1. This is<br>
because, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 1,<br>
the first phase shifter arrangement 27' can be used to<br>
compensate for two dipole squares while, in contrast,<br>
in the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 7, this<br>
phase shifter 27' can be used only for driving one<br>
dipole square in a corresponding manner. In this<br>
exemplary embodiment as well, a corresponding designed<br>
patch antenna element may, of course, be used instead<br>
of the dipole square as explained, via which the<br>
respective two pairs of feed points are fed for one<br>
polarization and for the other polarization.<br>
