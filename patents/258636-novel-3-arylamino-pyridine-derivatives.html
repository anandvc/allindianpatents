Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a series of substitued 3-arylamino pyridine derivatives that are<br>
useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer and inflammation,<br>
in mammals. Also disclosed is the use of such compounds in the treatment of<br>
hyperproliferative diseases in mammals, especially humans, and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing such compounds.<br>
Summary of the related art<br>
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a central signal transduction pathway, which<br>
transmits signals from multiple cell surface receptors to transcription factors in the<br>
nucleus which regulate gene expression. This pathway is frequently referred to as the<br>
MAP kinase pathway as MARK stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase indicating<br>
that this pathway can be stimulated by mitogens, cytokines and growth factors (Steelman<br>
et al., Leukemia 2004, 18, 189-218). Depending upon the stimulus and cell type, this<br>
pathway can transmit signals, which result in the prevention or induction of apoptosis or<br>
cell cycle progression. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been shown to play<br>
important roles in cell proliferation and the prevention of apoptosis. Aberrant activation of<br>
this pathway is commonly observed in malignantly transformed cells. Amplification of ras<br>
proto-oncogenes and activating mutations that lead to the expression of constitutively<br>
active Ras proteins are observed in approximately 30% of all human cancers (Stirewalt<br>
et al., Blood 2001, 97, 3589-95). Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in 50% of<br>
colon and &gt;90% pancreatic cancers as well as many other types of cancers (Kohl et al.,<br>
Science 1993, 260, 1834-1837). The effects of Ras on proliferation and tumorigenesis<br>
have been documented in immortal cell lines (McCubrey et al., Int J Oncol 1995, 7,<br>
295-310). bRaf mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant<br>
melanoma (Davies, H et al., Nature 2002, 417, 949-954). Given the high level of<br>
mutations that have been detected at Ras, this pathway has always been considered a<br>
key target for therapeutic intervention (Chang et al., Leukemia 2003, 77,1263-93).<br>
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway can exert proliferative or antiproliferative<br>
effects through downstream transcription factor targets including NF-icB, CREB, Ets-1,<br>
AP-1 and c-Myc. ERKs can directly phosphorylate Ets-1, AP-1 and c-Myc, which lead to<br>
their activation. Alternatively, ERKs can phosphorylate and activate a downstream kinase<br>
target RSK, which then phosphorylates and activates transcription factors, such as<br>
CREB. These transcription factors induce the expression of genes important for cell<br>
cycle progression, for example, Cdks, cyclins, growth factors, and apoptosis prevention,<br>
for example, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and cytokines. Overall, treatment of cells with growth<br>
factors leads to the activation of ERKs which results in proliferation and, in some cases,<br>
differentiation (Lewis et al., Adv. Cancer Res, 1998, 74, 49-139).<br>
MEK proteins are the primary downstream targets of Raf. The MEK family of genes<br>
consists of five genes: MEK1, MEK2, MEK3, MEK4 and MEK5. This family of dualspecificity<br>
kinases has both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activity. The structure of<br>
MEK consists of an amino-terminal negative regulatory domain and a carboxy-terminal<br>
MAP kinase-binding domain, which is necessary for binding and activation of ERKs.<br>
Deletion of the regulatory MEK1 domain results in constitutive MEK1 and ERK activation<br>
(Steelman et al., Leukemia 2004, 18, 189-218).<br>
MEK1 is a 393-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 44 kDa (Crews et al.,<br>
Science 1992, 258, 478-80). MEK1 is modestly expressed in embryonic development<br>
and is elevated in adult tissue with the highest levels detected in brain tissue. MEK1<br>
requires phosphorylation of S218 and S222 for activation, and substitution of these<br>
residues with D or glutamic acid (E) led to an increase in activity and foci formation in<br>
NIH3T3 cells (Huang et al., Mol Biol Cell, 1995, 6, 237-45). Constitutive activity of MEK1<br>
in primary cell culture promotes senescence and induces p53 and p16INK4a, and the<br>
opposite was observed in immortalized cells or cells lacking either p53 or p16INK4a(Lin et<br>
al., Genes Dev, 1998 , 12, 3008-3019). Constitutive activity of MEK1 inhibits NF-KB<br>
transcription by negatively regulating p38MAPK activity (Carter et al., J Biol Chem 2000,<br>
275, 27858-64). The main physiological substrates of MEK are the members of the ERK<br>
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase) or MARK (mitogen activated protein kinase) family<br>
of genes. Aberrant expression of MEK1 has been detected in many different types of<br>
cancer, and mutated forms of MEK1 will transform fibroblast, hematopoietic and other<br>
cell types.<br>
Constitutive activation of MEK1 results in cellular transformation. It therefore represents<br>
a likely target for pharmacological intervention in proliferative and inflammatory diseases<br>
(Lee et al., Nature 1994, 372, 739-746; Dudley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995,<br>
92, 7686-7689).<br>
Useful inhibitors of MEK have been developed that show potential therapeutic benefit in<br>
several studies. For example, small molecule MEK inhibitors have been shown to inhibit<br>
human tumor growth in nude mouse xenografts (Yeh, T. et al, Proceedings of the<br>
American Association of Cancer Research 2004, 45, Abs 3889 and Lee, P. et al.,<br>
Proceedings of the American Association of Cancer Research 2004, 45, Abs 3890). MEK<br>
inhibitors also entered clinical trials, i.e. ARRY142886 (Wallace, E. et al, Proceedings of<br>
the American Association of Cancer Research 2004, 45, Abs 3891), PD-0325901<br>
(Swanton C, Johnston S IDDB MEETING REPORT2003, February 13-1) and PD-<br>
184352 (Waterhouse et al., Proceedings of the American Society for Clinical Oncology<br>
2003, 22, Abs 816)<br>
Compounds suitable as MEK inhibitors are also disclosed in US 5,525,625; WO<br>
98/43960; WO 99/01421; WO 99/01426; WO 00/41505; WO 00/42002; WO 00/42003;<br>
WO 00/41994; WO 00/42022; WO 00/42029; WO 00/68201; WO 01/68619; WO<br>
02/06213; WO 03/077855; WO03/077914; WO2004/005284; WO2004/056789.<br>
However, PD-184352 was lacking efficacy in clinical phase II trials. Tumors were much<br>
less responsive, as no partial responses and only a few patients with stable disease<br>
were observed. As a result, the clinical trials of this molecule were suspended (Mclnnes<br>
C IDDB MEETING REPORT 2003). PD-184352 was limited by poor solubility, high<br>
metabolic clearance and low bioavailability. This exemplifies the need for novel MEK<br>
inhibitors with superior pharmacological properties.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In view of the foregoing it is the object of the present invention to provide novel MEK<br>
inhibitors useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases related to the hyperactivity<br>
of MEK as well as diseases modulated by the MEK cascade, such as cancer and<br>
inflammation, in mammals with superior pharmacological properties both with respect to<br>
their activities as well as their solubility, metabolic clearance and bioavailability<br>
characteristics.<br>

wherein the amino group in a compound of the present invention is acylated, alkylated or<br>
phosphorylated to form, e.g., eicosanoylamino, alanylamino, pivaloyloxymethylamino or<br>
wherein the hydroxyl group is acylated, alkylated, phosphorylated or converted into the<br>
borate, e.g. acetyloxy, palmitoyloxy, pivaloyloxy, succinyloxy, fumaryloxy, alanyloxy or<br>
wherein the carboxyl group is esterified or amidated. These compounds can be produced<br>
from compounds of the present invention according to well-known methods. Other<br>
examples of the prodrug are compounds, wherein the carboxylate in a compound of the<br>
present invention is for example converted into an alkyl-, aryl-, choline-, amino,<br>
acyloxymethylester, linolenoyl-ester.<br>
Metabolites of compounds of the present invention are also within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Where tautomerism, like e.g. keto-enol tautomerism, of compounds of the present<br>
invention or their prodrugs may occur, the individual forms, like e.g. the keto and enol<br>
form, are claimed separately and together as mixtures in any ratio. Same applies for<br>
stereoisomers, like e.g. enantiomers, cis/trans isomers, conformers and the like.<br>
If desired, isomers can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. by liquid<br>
chromatography. Same applies for enantiomers by using e.g. chiral stationary phases.<br>
Additionally, enantiomers may be isolated by converting them into diastereomers, i.e.<br>
coupling with an enantiomerically pure auxiliary compound, subsequent separation of the<br>
resulting diastereomers and cleavage of the auxiliary residue. Alternatively, any<br>
enantiomer of a compound of the present invention may be obtained from<br>
stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials.<br>

invention contain one or more acidic or basic groups, the invention also comprises their<br>
corresponding pharmaceutically or toxicologically acceptable salts, in particular their<br>
pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus, the compounds of the of the present invention<br>
which contain acidic groups can be present on these groups and can be used according<br>
to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as<br>
ammonium salts More precise examples of such salts include sodium salts, potassium<br>
salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as,<br>
for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of<br>
the present invention which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be<br>

acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, and other acids known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. If the compounds of the present invention simultaneously<br>
contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule, the invention also includes, in addition<br>
to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). The respective salts can<br>
be obtained by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art like,<br>
for example by contacting these with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or<br>
dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange with other salts. The present<br>
invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the present invention which, owing<br>
to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in Pharmaceuticals but<br>
which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the<br>
preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>

agents, signal transduction inhibitors, and antiproliferative agents.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of the present invention can be combined as the active<br>
ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral<br>
(including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the<br>
usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils,<br>
alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral<br>
liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers<br>
such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents,<br>
lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid<br>
preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the<br>
solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
obviously employed, if desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or<br>
nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1<br>
percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions<br>
may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60<br>
percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically<br>
useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active<br>
compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum<br>
tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a<br>
disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as<br>
magnesium stearate, and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin.<br>
When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the<br>
above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the<br>
dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or<br>
elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent,<br>
methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or<br>
orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or<br>
suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol,<br>
liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of<br>
storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or<br>
dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the<br>
extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of<br>
manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of<br>
microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion<br>
medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol<br>
and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal,<br>
especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For<br>
example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be<br>
employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions,<br>
capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of the<br>
present invention are administered orally.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular<br>
compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the<br>
severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
When treating or preventing cancer, inflammation or other proliferative diseases for<br>
which compounds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactory results<br>
are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily<br>
dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body<br>
weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day,<br>
or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from<br>
about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, preferably from about 1 milligram to about<br>
50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be<br>
from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted<br>
to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of<br>
the following Schemes and Examples, using appropriate materials and are further<br>
exemplified by the following specific examples. Moreover, by utilizing the procedures<br>
described herein, in conjunction with ordinary skills in the art, additional compounds of<br>
the present invention claimed herein can be readily prepared. The compounds illustrated<br>
in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is<br>
considered as the invention. The examples further illustrate details for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily understand<br>
that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative<br>
procedures can be used to prepare these compounds. The instant compounds are<br>
generally isolated in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as those<br>
described above. The amine-free bases corresponding to the isolated salts can be<br>
generated by neutralization with a suitable base, such as aqueous sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and<br>
extraction of the liberated amine-free base into an organic solvent, followed by<br>
evaporation. The amine-free base, isolated in this manner, can be further converted into<br>
another pharmaceutically acceptable salt by dissolution in an organic solvent, followed<br>
by addition of the appropriate acid and subsequent evaporation, precipitation or<br>
crystallization.<br>
An illustration of the preparation of compounds of the present invention is shown in<br>

and Structure", 5th Edition; John Wiley &amp; Sons. Scheme 3 illustrates the preparation of<br>
compounds of the present invention where W is heterocyclic. In step 1 the 3-anilino<br>
isonicotinic acid derivative 5 is reacted with pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate and a<br>
base, for example pyridine, to give the active ester 6 which is further converted in step 2<br>
to hydrazide 7 by reacting it with hydrazine or hydrazine hydrate in an inert solvent such<br>
as DCM, DMF or THF. Reaction of 7 with GDI or any suitable carbonate equivalent in a<br>
preferred solvent such as DMF or DCM for example then gives Oxadiazolone 8, which<br>
forms N-substiutued hydrazinecarboxamides 9 when treated with a substitued amine in<br>
ethanol. Cyclization is achived by adddition of triphenylphosphine and a base such as<br>
triethylamine or DIPEA in an inert solvent like CCI4 for example to give compound 10.<br>
Compounds with other variants in the position of W can be prepared by derivatizing the<br>
COOH group appropriately as known to the person skilled in the art as described in<br>
Theophil Eicher, Siegfried Hauptrnann "The Chemistry of Heterocycles; Structures,<br>
Reactions, Synthesis and Application", 2ld edition, Wiley-VCH 2003. The introduction of<br>
alternative heterocyciic or heteroaryl groups is exemplified e.g. in WO 03/077855 and<br>
WO 01/05391.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, all non-aqueous reactions were carried out either under an<br>
argon or nitrogen atmosphere with commercial dry solvents. Compounds were purified<br>
using flash column chromatography using Merck silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), or by<br>
reverse phase preparative HPLC using a Reprosil-Pur ODS3, 5/vm, 20 x 125 mm<br>

Assay 1: MEK-1 enzyme assay (LANCE-HTRF)<br>
The activity of the compounds of the present invitation may be determined by the<br>
following procedure: Inhibition of human MEK1 kinase activity was monitored with a<br>
homogenous, fluorescence based assay. The assay uses time resolved fluorescence<br>
resonance energy transfer to probe for phosphorylation of ERK1 by MEK1. The assay is<br>
carried out in low volume 96 well microtiterplates. In a total volume of 15/;l, compounds<br>
are incubated with 100nM MEK1, 15 jjM ATP, SOOnM ERK2 employing a buffer<br>
containing 20mM TRIS/HCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 100/vM NaVO4, 1 mM DTT, and 0.005%<br>
Tween 20 (pH 7.4) After two hours, 5 nM Europium-anti-PY20 (Perkin Elmer) and 50nM<br>
Anti-GST-Allophycocyanin (CisBio) in buffer containing 50mM EDTA and 0,05% BSA are<br>
added and the reaction incubated for one hour in the dark. Time-resolved fluorescence is<br>
measured using a LJL-Analyst (Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 340<br>
nm and an emission wavelength of 665 nm. The final concentration of DMSO is 2 %. To<br>
assess the inhibitory potential of the compounds, IC50-values were determined.<br>
In this assay compounds of the invention exhibited IC50s within certain ranges. The<br>
following compounds exemplify such activity with "+" meaning 1uM 
"++" IC50  1uM. All results are shown in Table 1.<br>
/Assay 2: Tumor cell proliferation assays (ATP Lite)<br>
Murine colon C26, human melanoma A375 and Mel5 or human pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cells<br>
were plated in 96 well Corning white plates (1500 cells/well for C26, and 2000 cells/well for<br>
A375, and MiaPaCa-2) and cultured overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. Inhibitors were serially<br>
diluted in 100 % DMSO and subsequently added to cells to reach a final concentration of<br>
0.25% DMSO. The cells were incubated for 4 days in the presence of test compounds in cell<br>
growth media (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM glutamine for C26, and MiaPaCa-2,<br>
and RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM glutamine for A375). Cell proliferation was<br>
quantitated using the ATP lite cell proliferation kit (Packard). Inhibition of cell proliferation is<br>
shown in Table 1. Columns 4-6 show the concentration of compounds required to induce<br>
50% cell death (IC50 in jaM) of human endometriotic cells. With "+" meaning 3u.M 
10p,M and "++" IC50 
tested on human melanoma cell Mel5. Compound of Example #124 showed an IC50 of<br>
"++", the compound of Example 4 showed an IC50 of"+" and the compound of Example<br>
5 showed an IC50 of"++".<br>
Assay 3; Microsomal stability assay<br>
Compounds were tested on their stability in human, rat and mouse liver microsomal<br>
preparations (HLM, RLM and MLM respectively). At a final concentration of 3 /jM,<br>
compounds were incubated at 37°C with 0.5 mg/ml human, rat or mouse liver<br>
microsomes in a buffer containing 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.4 and 2 mM NADPH. Pooled<br>
human liver microsomes or pooled male rat liver microsomes (Sprague Dawley) were<br>
obtained from NatuTec (Frankfurt, Germany). Incubations without NADPH served as<br>
negative controls. Reactions were stopped after 0, 15, 30, 45 or 60 min by the addition of<br>
acetonitrile and microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 6200 x g).<br>
Supernatants were analyzed by HPLC regarding the concentration of mother compound.<br>
Finally, the half life of compounds in the regarding microsomal preparation was<br>
calculated. Results are shown in Table 2. Wherein "+" means ti/2of 1-30 min,"++" means<br>
ti/2 of 31 -120 min and "+++" means t1/2 of &gt;120 min.<br>
Assay 4: Caco-2 permeability assay<br>
Caco-2 cells obtained from the ATCC at passage number 27 are used. Cells (passage<br>
number 40-60) were seeded on to Millipore Multiscreen Caco-2 plates or Falcon HTS<br>
inserts at 1 x 105 cells/cm2. Ceils were cultured for 20 days in DMEM and media was<br>
changed every two or three days. On day 20 the permeability study was performed.<br>
Permeability was studied by applying compound to the apical surface of cell monolayers<br>
and measuring compound permeation into the basolateral compartment. The experiment<br>
was also performed in the reverse direction (B-A) to investigate active transport. Hanks<br>
Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) pH 7.4 buffer with 25mM HEPES and 10mM glucose at<br>
37°C was used as the medium in permeability studies. Incubations were carried out in an<br>
atmosphere of 5% CC-2 with a relative humidity of 95%.<br>
The monolayers were prepared by rinsing both basolateral and apical surfaces twice with<br>
HBSS at 37°C. Cells were then incubated with HBSS in both apical and basolateral<br>
compartments for 40 minutes to stabilize physiological parameters.<br>
HBSS was then removed from the apical compartment and replaced with test compound<br>
dosing solutions. The solutions were made by diluting 10mM DMSO concentrates with<br>
HBSS to give a final test compound concentration of 10//M (final DMSO concentration<br>
adjusted to 1%) The fluorescent integrity marker lucifer yellow was also included in the<br>
dosing solution. Analytical standards were made from dosing solutions. Test compound<br>
permeability was assessed in duplicate. On each plate compounds of known<br>
permeability characteristics were run as controls.<br>
The apical compartment inserts were then placed into 'companion' plates containing<br>
fresh HBSS. For basolateral to apical (B-A) experiments the experiment was initiated by<br>
replacing buffer in the inserts then placing them in companion plates containing dosing<br>
solutions. At 120 minutes the companion plate was removed and apical and basolateral<br>
samples diluted for analysis by LC-MS/MS (the donor compartment was also sampled to<br>
permit determination of starting concentration after non-specific binding has occurred).<br>
Analysis<br>
The integrity of the monolayers throughout the experiment is checked by monitoring<br>
lucifer yellow permeation using fluorimetric analysis. Lucifer yellow permeation was low if<br>
monolayers have not been damaged. Test and control compounds were quantified by<br>
LC-MS/MS cassette analysis using a 5-point calibration with appropriate dilution of the<br>
samples. Should lucifer yellow Papps were above QC limits in more than one well per<br>
test compound, the compound was re-tested.<br>
The permeability coefficient for each compound (Papp) was calculated from the following<br>
equation:<br>
Papp = [dO/dt]/[C0 x A]<br>
Whereby dQ/dt is the rate of permeation of the drug across the cells, Co is the donor<br>
compartment concentration at time zero and A is the area of the cell monolayer. Co is<br>
obtained from analysis of the donor compartment at the end of the incubation period.<br>
Test compounds were grouped into low, medium or high absorption potential based on<br>
comparison with control compounds, which have known human absorption.<br>
In addition, permeation was studied in both directions across the cells, and an<br>
asymmetry index was reported from mean A-B and B-A data. This was derived from:<br>
Papp (B-A/Papp (A-B)<br>
Results are shown in Table 2. Wherein "+" means a caco A-B and caco B-A value of 1-10<br>
and "++"means a caco A-B and caco B-A value of 11 -100.<br>
