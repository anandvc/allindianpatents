Axial Fan Having Adjustable Blades and Method of Mounting the<br>
Blades<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to an axial fan having an impeller and adjustable blades and having the features of the introductory portion of claim 1 as well as to a method of mounting the blades.<br>
Modern axial fans are work machines that can be regulated and that convert mechanical energy into kinetic energy. The regulation of the axial fans is effected by the speed or the angle of the position of the blades. If the position of the blades is to be altered during operation, the blades must be secured to a supported shaft, a spindle. Previously, such a spindle was placed into the impeller from the outside and threadedly fastened from the inside. Such a manner of operation is relatively complicated and requires various components.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to simplify the construction of the spindle mounting of an axial fan of the aforementioned general type and hence to make it more economical.<br><br>
The object is realized pursuant to the invention for an axial fan of the aforementioned type by the characterizing features of claim 1. A method for mounting the blades is the subject matter of claim 3. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are provided in the dependent claims.<br>
The inventive construction of the spindle mounting permits assembly of the spindles and blades of the axial fan from within the impeller. In addition to the fixation of the spindle support in the supporting ring, the threaded connection or fixation of the spindle that is to be carried out from the outside makes it possible to secure the blades directly on the tubular nuts. The overall number of components that are required for the spindle mounting are reduced, as are the processing and assembly expenditures.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is explained in greater detail in the following and is illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	is a longitudinal cross-sectional view through an<br>
axial fan pursuant to the invention, and<br><br>
Figs. 2.1-2.5 are longitudinal cross-sectional views through an axial fan showing the sequence of successive assembly steps.<br>
The axial fan contains an impeller 1 having adjustable blades 2. The impeller 1 is secured to a shaft 3 and comprises a hub 4, a supporting ring 5, a covering 6 and a cover 7.<br>
Disposed in the interior of the hub 4 is an adjustment disk 8, which is displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the axial fan by means of a hydraulic adjustment mechanism 9. The adjustment mechanism 9 is known and is not the subject matter of the invention, so that a detailed description is dispensed with.<br>
The adjustment disk 8 is provided with a circumferential groove into which offset or angled levers 10 engage. Each lever 10 is connected with a spindle 11, which is rotatably mounted in the supporting ring 5. Upon displacement of the adjustment disk 8, the spindles 11 are rotated by the levers 10 about their longitudinal axes.<br><br>
One of the blades 2 is secured to each spindle 11 in the following manner. The position of the blades 2 can be altered by the adjustment disk 8 and the adjustment mechanism 9.<br>
The adjustable blades 2 require a special, slightly pitched mounting. For this purpose, each spindle 11 is guided through a radial bore 12 in the supporting ring 5 and through an extension or adapter 13 that is disposed in line with the bore 12. The support of the spindle 11 in the supporting ring 5 and in the adapter 13 is comprised of a roller bearing 14 and a sleeve or bushing 15. The roller bearing 14 is accommodated by an enlarged area 16 of the bore 12 at the radially inner edge of the supporting ring 5. The enlarged area 16 of the bore 12 forms a shoulder 17 against which the roller bearing 14 rests on the inside of the supporting ring 5. Provided in the radially outer end of the adapter 13 of the supporting ring 5 is a recessed area 18 for the bushing 15 of the spindle support. Within this recessed area 18, the outside of the bushing 15 rests against the adapter 13.<br>
The outer end of the spindle 11 projects out of the adapter 13 of the supporting ring 5 and is provided on this portion with a thread. Threaded into or onto the thread of the spindle 11 is a tubular nut 19 which is provided with a flange 20 having an inner and an outer edge.<br><br>
In the threaded-in state, an end face of the tubular nut 19 is supported against the adapter 13 of the supporting ring 5. The tubular nut 19 thus fixes the support of the spindle 11 in the supporting ring 5.<br>
Each blade 2 is connected directly with the tubular nut 19. In this connection, screws 21 are threaded through a base 22 of the blade 2 into the tubular nut 19.<br>
The described principle of construction of the spindle mounting is based on being able to insert the spindle 11 into the supporting ring 5 from within during the assembly of the impeller 1.<br>
In Fig. 2.1, the impeller 1 is shown without spindle 11 and blades 2. Proceeding from here, first the roller bearing 14 is slipped onto the spindle 11, and a bushing 15 is glued into the adapter 13 of the supporting ring 5.<br>
The spindle 11, along with the roller bearing 14, is subsequently placed from the inside into the supporting ring 5 and is prevented from falling out inwardly by a retaining ring and via a sealing cover (Fig. 2.2).<br><br>
The tubular nut 19 is placed on from above and is threaded directly with the spindle 11 (Fig. 2.3).<br>
The blades 2 are connected by screws 21 to the tubular nut 19 (Fig. 2.4). The further assembly of the impeller 1 is thereafter effected by connecting the levers 10 with the spindles 11, and the cover 7 and the adjustment mechanism 9 are disposed on the impeller 1 (Fig. 2.5).<br>
