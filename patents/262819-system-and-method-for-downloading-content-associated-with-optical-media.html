SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DOWNLOADING CONTENT ASSOCIATED WITH<br>
OPTICAL MEDIA<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present disclosure relates in general to optical media, and more particularly downloading content associated with optical media.<br><br>
ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 (DC-15447)<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information.  One option available to 5  users is information handling systems.  An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information.  Because<br>
10  technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how<br>
15  quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated.  The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline<br>
20  reservations, enterprise data storage, or global<br>
communications.  In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems,<br>
25  data storage systems, and networking systems.<br>
Information handling systems are often used in the entertainment industry.  As a specific example, optical media has often been used to store audio and visual information.  For instance. Compact Disc (CD) optical media,<br>
30  which interact with an infrared laser to store and read<br>
information, are commonly used to store music and/or other data.  Similarly, Digital Versatile Disc {DVD) optical<br>
AUS01:S23254.1<br><br>
ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 {DC-15447)<br>
media, which interact with a red laser to store and read information, are commonly used to store movies for commercial sale, as well as other data.  Recently, a new type of optical medium has been developed that uses a blue 5  laser to read and write information, such as with the Blu-ray Disc (BD) or High Definition DVD specifications, for example.  One advantage of blue laser media is that the smaller wavelength of the blue laser compared with the infrared and red lasers allows greater storage density for<br>
10  blue laser optical media.  The greater storage media<br>
provides capacity to hold feature length High Definition movies and support desirable additional features, such as functions controlled by BD-Java (BD-J) applications running in connection with a Blu-ray Disc per the Blu-ray<br>
15  specification.<br>
Such additional features may include user interactivity that allows a viewer of the blue laser media to download of promotional and other content from content providers. Content downloaded in connection with the blue laser media<br>
20  may often be High Definition content, and thus may include a file with a very large size.  Using traditional download mechanisms, a download of files associated with these additional features may take a significant amount of time, thus negatively affecting the viewer experience.<br><br>
ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 (DC-15447)<br>

ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 (DC-15447)<br>
17<br>
configurations of system 100.  As such, the preferred initialization point for method 300 and the order of the steps 302-318 comprising method 300 may depend on the implementation chosen. 5      At step 302, optical medium 116 may be loaded into optical drive 108.  For example, a user of information handling system may manually load optical medium 116 into optical drive 108,  In other embodiments, optical medium 116 may be automatically loaded into optical drive 108 (e.g.,<br>
10  from a disc magazine).<br>
At step 304, information handling system 102 may play optical medium 116 and load data and/or executable programs stored thereon in any suitable manner.<br>
At step 306, a request may be made to download an item<br>
15  of content associated with optical medium 116 from content provider 126.  For example, such request may be made by a user of information handling system 102 by selecting a menu option after optical medium 116 has started playing (e.g., the user's selection of additional and/or advanced features<br>
20  associated with optical medium 116).  In other embodiments, such request may be made automatically, as part of automatic playing of optical medium 116.<br>
At step 308, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may determine<br>
25  the total size of the content to be downloaded from content provider 126.  Such determination may be made in any suitable manner, including without limitation, a BD-J xlet and/or other set of executable instructions configured to request from content provider 126 the size of the content to<br>
30  be downloaded.<br>
At step 310, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may determine<br>
AUSOl:523254.1<br><br>
ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 (DC-15447)<br>
18<br>
the capacity (e.g., download speed) of the network connection between information handling system 102 and content provider 126.  Such determination may be made in any suitable manner, including without limitation, a BD-J xlet 5  and/or other set of executable instructions (e.g., Internet Speed Test) configured to request from content provider 126 the size of the content to be downloaded.<br>
At step 312, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may, based at<br>
10  least on the capacity of the network connection, determine a fractional download size.  Such determination may be made in any suitable manner, including without limitation, a BD-J xlet and/or other set of executable instructions configured to determine a fractional download size in accordance with<br>
15  the present disclosure.  The determined fractional download size may be such that a file of the fractional download size (or smaller) would be expected to download within a desired download time, given the capacity of the network connection. For example, if the capacity of the network connection is<br>
20  determined to be a 512 kilobit-per-second (Kbps) connection, and it is desired that downloads not exceed two minutes, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system may determine the fractional download size to be 100 megabytes (MB),<br>
25      The desired download time may be determined in any<br>
suitable manner.  For example, the desired download time may be predetermined by the author and/or creator of optical medium 116 and/or stored as data thereon that may be read during execution of method 300.  An another example, the<br>
30  desired download time may be determined automatically by information handling system 102, one or more of its components, and/or an operating system executing thereon<br>

ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 {DC-15447)<br>
19<br>
based on one or more parameters and/or physical properties associated with information handling system 102 and/or its individual components.  As a further example, the desired download time may be determined by a user of information 5  handling system 102, e.g., in accordance with personal preference.<br>
At step 314, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may issue a plurality of fractional download requests, each fractional<br>
10  download request including a request to download a<br>
respective portion of the content to be downloaded such that each portion is less than or approximately equal in file size to the determined fractional download size.  For example, if the content to be downloaded has a size of<br>
15  300MB, and the determined fractional download size is 100MB, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may issue three fractional download requests, wherein each request includes a request to download a respective lOOMB-portion of the content to be<br>
20  downloaded.  As another example, if the content to be downloaded has a size of 360MB, and the determined fractional download size is 100MB, download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may issue four fractional download requests, wherein each<br>
25  request includes a request to download a respective 90MB-portion of the content to be downloaded.  Although the specific examples set forth above contemplate that each fractional download request includes a request to download an identically-sized or similarly-sized portion, the sizes<br>
30  of the content portions may be differently-sized.  In certain embodiments, one or more of the portions may download substantially in parallel.<br>
AUSOl;523254.1<br><br>
ATTORNEY'S DOCKET	PATENT APPLICATION<br>
016295.3876 (DC-15447)<br>
20<br>
In BD-J embodiments of download module 114, each of the fractional download requests may include an xlet, wherein an application manager (e.g., application manager 208) manages (e.g., via entries in an application management table) the 5  execution of the individual fractional download xlets.  For example, application manager 208 may maintain the completion status of each fractional download request xlet and/or the portion of content associated with each fractional download request xlet.<br>
10      At step 316, download module 114 and/or another<br>
component of information handling system 102 may download each portion of content from content provider 126.  In some embodiments, one or more portions of content may be downloaded substantially in parallel.  Such download may<br>
15  occur via one or more HTTP connections, FTP connections, or any other suitable connection.  Downloaded content may be stored in one or more components of information handling system 102, including without limitation optical media 116. At step 318, after all portions of content associated<br>
20  with the fractional download requests have completed,<br>
download module 114 and/or another component of information handling system 102 may appropriately combine the individual portions to store (e.g., in memory 103 and/or another component of information handling system 102) the content<br>
25  for use by information handling system 102.  IN BD-J<br>
implementations, such combination and/or storing may be made in any suitable manner, including without limitation, a BD-J xlet and/or other set of executable instructions configured to reassemble the individual portions after such portions<br>
30  have completed downloading.<br>
Although FIGURE 3 discloses a particular number of steps to be taken with respect to method 300, method 300 may<br>

be executed with greater or lesser steps than those depicted in FIGURE 3.  In addition, although FIGURE 3 discloses a certain order of steps to be taken with respect to method 300, the steps comprising method 300 may be completed in any 5  suitable order.<br>
Method 300 may be implemented using system 100 or any other system operable to implement method 300.  In certain embodiments, method 300 may be implemented partially or fully in software embodied in computer-readable media.<br>
10      Using the methods and systems disclosed herein, problems associated with conventional approaches to downloading content associated with an optical medium may be improved, reduced, or eliminated.  For example, methods and systems disclosed herein may leverage functionality present<br>
15  in an optical medium to facilitate faster download of content by dividing an item of content into multiple portions or threads and downloading such portions in parallel, thus potentially reducing download times and potentially improving user experience.<br>
20      Although the present disclosure has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and the scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.<br>
