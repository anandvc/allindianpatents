The compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention exist in two isomer forms of (R) configuration and (S) configuration based on the asymmetric carbon atom having a hydroxy group.  Either one of the isomers or a mixture thereof can be employed in the present invention, and the (R) configuration isomer is preferable.<br>
When the in vitro test for measuring β2-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity was carried out in the usual way using isolated rat pregnant uterus, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention showed an activity to relax 50% of the spontaneous contractions of rat myometrium (i.e., EC50) at an approximate<br>
molar concentration of 5.0 x 10-9 to 5.0 X10-6.  For example, 2- [ (2S) -2- [ [ (2R)-2-hydroxy-2- (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl] amino]-1, 2 , 3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC50 value at a molar concentration of 1.5 XlO-s.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent β2-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity and<br>
therefore are remarkably useful as β2-adrenergic receptor<br>
stimulating agents.<br>
When the in vitro test for measuring β1-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity was carried out in the usual way using isolated rat atrium, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention showed an activity to increase 20 beats per minute of rat heart rate (EC2o value) at an approximate molar concentration of 1.0 X 10-6<br>
or more.  For example, 2- [ (2S) -2- [ [ (2R) -2-hydroxy-2- (4-hydroxyphenyl )ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy ]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC20 value at a molar<br>
concentration of 1.6 X10-6.  Thus, the compounds of the<br>
present invention have markedly weaker β1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity in comparison with the above β2-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity.<br>
In consequence, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent β2-adrenergic receptor stimulating<br>
activity with markedly high selectivity in comparison with β1-<br>
adrenergic receptor stimulating activity, so that these are extremely useful highly selective β2-adrenergic receptor<br>
stimulating agents of in which burdens on cardiovascular systems are reduced due to suppression of side effects upon the heart (e.g., tachycardia) caused by β1-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity.<br>
The compounds of present invention are selective β2-<br>
adrenergic receptor stimulating agents which are extremely useful as, for example, an agent for the prevention of threatened abortion, premature labor, as an agent for the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with bronchiostenosis or airway obstruction (bronchodilator) and as an agent for pain remission or stone removal in urolithiasis.<br>
Also, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention are an extremely stable compound and therefore have excellent storage stability.<br>
When the phenylethanolaminotetralincarboxamide<br>
derivatives represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are employed in the practical treatment, they are administered orally or parenterally in the form of appropriate pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, injections, and the like.  These pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in accordance with conventional methods using conventional pharmaceutical carriers, excipients and other additives.<br>
The dosage is appropriately decided depending on the sex, age, body weight, degree of symptoms and the like of each patient to be treated, which is approximately within the range of from 1 to 1,000 mg per day per adult human in the case of oral administration and approximately within the range of from 0.01 to 100 mg per day per adult human in the case of parenteral administration, and the daily dosage can be divided into one to several doses per day.<br>

Action of the agent on the spontaneous contractions of isolated<br>
rat myometrium<br>
The uterus of a pregnant SD rat (21 days of pregnancy) was isolated.  A uterine muscle strip (15 mm long, 5 mm wide) was longitudinally dissected and suspended vertically in a 10 ml chamber and prepared for recording of isometric contractions. The endometrium and placenta-attached part were carefully removed from the uterus with a fine forceps, and the test was carried out in accordance with the Magnus method.  The sample was set in Locke-Ringer solution at 37°C aerated with a mixed gas containing 95% of oxygen and 5% of carbon dioxide, and 1 g of load was applied.  Spontaneous contractions of isolated rat myometrium were induced isometrically via a pressure transducer and recorded on a rectigram.  The efficacy was evaluated by comparing the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes before the addition of the agent with the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes after the addition of the agent and calculating the 50% inhibitory concentration as EC50.<br>

When the in vitro test for measuring β2-adrenergic<br>

molar concentration of 5.0 x 10-9 to 5.0 X10-6.  For example, 2- [ (2S) -2- [ [ (2R)-2-hydroxy-2- (4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl] amino]-1, 2 , 3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC50 value at a molar concentration of 1.5 XlO-s.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent β2-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity and<br>
therefore are remarkably useful as β2-adrenergic receptor<br>
stimulating agents.<br>
When the in vitro test for measuring β1-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity was carried out in the usual way using isolated rat atrium, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention showed an activity to increase 20 beats per minute of rat heart rate (EC2o value) at an approximate molar concentration of 1.0 X 10-6<br>
or more.  For example, 2- [ (2S) -2- [ [ (2R) -2-hydroxy-2- (4-hydroxyphenyl )ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy ]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC20 value at a molar<br>
concentration of 1.6 X10-6.  Thus, the compounds of the<br>
present invention have markedly weaker β1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity in comparison with the above β2-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity.<br>
In consequence, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent β2-adrenergic receptor stimulating<br>
activity with markedly high selectivity in comparison with β1-<br>
adrenergic receptor stimulating activity, so that these are extremely useful highly selective β2-adrenergic receptor<br>
stimulating agents of in which burdens on cardiovascular systems are reduced due to suppression of side effects upon the heart (e.g., tachycardia) caused by β1-adrenergic<br>
receptor stimulating activity.<br>
The compounds of present invention are selective β2-<br>
adrenergic receptor stimulating agents which are extremely useful as, for example, an agent for the prevention of threatened abortion, premature labor, as an agent for the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with bronchiostenosis or airway obstruction (bronchodilator) and as an agent for pain remission or stone removal in urolithiasis.<br>
Also, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention are an extremely stable compound and therefore have excellent storage stability.<br>
When the phenylethanolaminotetralincarboxamide<br>
derivatives represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are employed in the practical treatment, they are administered orally or parenterally in the form of appropriate pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, injections, and the like.  These pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in accordance with conventional methods using conventional pharmaceutical carriers, excipients and other additives.<br>
The dosage is appropriately decided depending on the sex, age, body weight, degree of symptoms and the like of each patient to be treated, which is approximately within the range of from 1 to 1,000 mg per day per adult human in the case of oral administration and approximately within the range of from 0.01 to 100 mg per day per adult human in the case of parenteral administration, and the daily dosage can be divided into one to several doses per day.<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Action of the agent on the spontaneous contractions of isolated<br>
rat myometrium<br>
The uterus of a pregnant SD rat (21 days of pregnancy) was isolated.  A uterine muscle strip (15 mm long, 5 mm wide) was longitudinally dissected and suspended vertically in a 10 ml chamber and prepared for recording of isometric contractions. The endometrium and placenta-attached part were carefully removed from the uterus with a fine forceps, and the test was carried out in accordance with the Magnus method.  The sample was set in Locke-Ringer solution at 37°C aerated with a mixed gas containing 95% of oxygen and 5% of carbon dioxide, and 1 g of load was applied.  Spontaneous contractions of isolated rat myometrium were induced isometrically via a pressure transducer and recorded on a rectigram.  The efficacy was evaluated by comparing the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes before the addition of the agent with the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes after the addition of the agent and calculating the 50% inhibitory concentration as EC50.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
Action of the agent on the heart rate of isolated rat atrium The atrium of an SD male rat (350 to 400 g in body weight)<br>
was isolated and the test was carried out in accordance with the Magnus method.  The sample was set in a Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37°C aerated with a mixture gas containing 95% of oxygen and 5% of carbon dioxide, and 1 g of load was applied. The atrial contraction was induced isometrically via a pressure transducer and recorded on a rectigram.  After addition of the agent, its efficacy was evaluated by calculating EC20 value<br>
which is the agent concentration which increases 20 beats per minute of heart rate.<br>
Test Example 3 Acute Toxicity<br>
To 4 female ICR mice of 4 weeks age was administered intravenously 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide in saline at dose of 50 mg/kg.  No death of animals was observed during 24 hours after the administration.<br><br><br><br>
