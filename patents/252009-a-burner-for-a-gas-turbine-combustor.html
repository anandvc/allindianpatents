				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a burner for a gas turbine combustor.<br>
The subject invention further relates to burners for gas turbines, and more particularly, to burners adapted to stabilize engine combustion, and still further, to burners that use a pilot combustor to provide combustion products (e.g., heat and free radicals) to stabilize the main lean premixed combustion.<br>
Gas turbines are employed in a variety of applications including electric power generation, military and commercial aviation, pipeline transmission and marine transportation. In a gas turbine engine, fuel and air are provided to a burner chamber where they are mixed and ignited by a flame, thereby initiating combustion. The major problems associated with the combustion process in gas turbine engines, in addition to thermal efficiency and proper mixing of the fuel and air, are flame stabilization, the elimination of pulsations and noise, and the control of polluting emissions, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx).<br>
The    combustion    process   requires   heat  to   be   added to the fuel-air<br>
mixture in order to initiate the reaction. Once the reaction has started, the heat<br>
released by the combustion can be used to initiate the reaction itself and the process<br>
becomes self-sustaining. However, some mechanism must be used to transport the<br>
heat from the combustion back upstream to the ignition point. Alternatively, where<br>
the reaction is not self-sustaining, heat and/or free radicals must be provided from a<br>
separate source, such as, a heated catalytic metal surface, or a separate pilot flame.<br>
Any combination of these methods, as well as, other methods, can also be used to<br>
provide the necessary heat to initiate combustion.<br>
The most common self-sustaining combustion process used in gas<br>
turbine engines utilizes swirling air flows that recirculate the combustion products and<br>
transport the hot gases and free radicals produced by the previously reacted fuel and<br>
air back upstream to initiate the combustion of the freshly mixed fuel and air. A prior<br>
art swirl-stabilized burner is illustrated in Figure 1 and is designate by reference<br>
numeral 100. Generally, with swirl-stabilized combustion, the center main<br>
recirculation zone is the dominant source of recirculated hot gases and free radicals<br>
that are transported upstream to stabilize the combustion. When the combustion<br>
process becomes very lean, and therefore, little heat is released from the combustion<br>
and the amount of heat and free radicals that are transported back upstream is<br>
insufficient to assure that combustion is initiated and sustained. The low temperatures<br>
of the lean combustion products produce low equilibrium levels of free radicals. The<br>
low temperature of the combustion products caused by the lean combustion also<br>
results in a low free radical production rate when the recirculated combustion<br>
products mix with the fresh un-reacted premixed fuel and air. Under these conditions<br>
the induction time required to initiate combustion becomes excessive and the flame<br>
blows away, or becomes unstable and fluctuates in intensity.<br>
The basic problem with lean premixed combustion systems used to<br>
produce low NOx emissions is that the fuel-air mixture must be so lean in order to<br>
have the flame temperature sufficiently low to prevent NOx production that under<br>
many operating conditions the combustion may not produce sufficient heat to be selfsustaining.<br>
An auxiliary source of heat and free radical must be used to sustain<br>
combustion. If an auxiliary pilot at high temperatures (close to stoichiometric) is<br>
used, it will stabilize the lean main flame, but it will produce substantial NOx<br>
emissions.<br>
Purely thermally initiated combustion starts the combustion process by<br>
pyrolyzing fuel at high temperatures to produce active free radicals. Initially this<br>
occurs with very low fuel consumption and no measurable temperature rise. Through<br>
chain branching reaction mechanisms the initially produced free radicals create an<br>
exponentially increasing pool of free radicals. Eventually the radical pool becomes<br>
sufficiently large to consume a significant amount of fuel, leading to rapid ignition<br>
(Wamatz). The time it takes for this pool of free radicals to increase sufficiently<br>
enough to cause the ignition is the "Ignition-Delay Time" or the "Induction Time".<br>
When the initial temperature is increased the production rate of free radicals is<br>
increased at an exponential rate and the induction time for initiation of combustion is<br>
reduced. If the initial temperature is less than the auto-ignition temperature, no<br>
ignition will occur for any time period. Free radicals, as well as, hot gases are<br>
contained in the combustion products that are mixed with the fresh premixed fuel-air<br>
mixture, in order to initiate combustion. These previously generated free radicals can<br>
significantly reduce the induction time for combustion. If the entrained free radicals<br>
are in sufficient quantity, rapid combustion initiation will occur at lower temperatures,<br>
which would otherwise have long induction times without the entrained free radicals.<br>
Stable combustion requires rapid initiation of combustion of the premixed fuel and air<br>
immediately after being mixed with the hot products of the previously burnt fuel.<br>
In view of the foregoing, a need exists for an improved burner, which<br>
reduces NOx emissions while maintaining a stable combustion process.<br>

These and other features of the burner of the present application will<br>
become more readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art form the<br>
following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, which illustrate an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the burner of the subject application, which has been designated by<br>
reference numeral 200. Burner 200 uses a pilot flame 202 to assist in sustaining and<br>
stabilizing the combustion process. Burners 200 includes, inter alia, a burner housing<br>
204, a pilot or pilot combustor 210 and a quencher 206. The burner housing 204 has<br>
axially opposed upstream and downstream end portions 212 and 214, respectively.<br>
Additionally, the housing 204 has several main fuel inlet passages 216 and several air<br>
inlet passage 218 which are adapted to supply fuel and air respectively to an internal<br>
chamber 219 defined in the housing 204.<br>
The pilot combustor 210 is disposed along the axis X-X of the burner<br>
housing 204 and has an inlet 260 for receiving a rich fuel and air mixture, a<br>
combustion chamber 262 within which the rich fuel and air mixture is combusted into<br>
combustion products, and an outlet 264 for exhausting the combustion products from<br>
the combustion chamber. The quencher 206 is disposed within the internal chamber<br>
219 of the burner housing 204 along the central axis X-X and positioned at the outlet<br>
264 of the pilot combustor 210. The quencher 206 has an air inlet 266 and a plurality<br>
of radially-oriented air outlets 268 for directing cooling air toward the quench section<br>
222 of the pilot combustor 210 and quenching the combustion products exhausted<br>
from the pilot combustor.<br>
Burner 200 includes a low NOx emissions pilot 210 that "generates" free<br>
radicals and heat that are directed at the forward stagnation point 212 and into the<br>
shear layer of the main recirculation zone 214. Burner 200 utilizes a pilot 210 that<br>
burns rich in order to:<br>
• Provide a stable high temperature heat source without high NOx<br>
emission,<br>
• Provide high quantities of free radicals (rich combustion at high<br>
temperature produces very high levels of free radicals), and<br>
• Provide the widest achievable stability limits.<br>
The rich combustion products must be quenched before mixing with the lean<br>
premixed main fuel and air in order to prevent high temperature combustion, which<br>
would result in the production of NOx emissions. The rich combustion produces low<br>
NOx emissions with high carbon monoxide (CO) and unbumed hydrocarbons due to<br>
the low oxygen levels. The unbumed hydrocarbon and CO produced by the rich pilot<br>
210 will be burned during the lean partially premixed combustion of the "main"<br>
premixed fuel.<br>
Rich Quench Lean (RQL) combustion systems are intended to produce low<br>
NOx emissions by rich combustion. The combustion process is called rich, when<br>
more fuel is supplied or consumed during combustion process than there is air<br>
available to react with it. Rich combustion results in low NOx emission, because the<br>
oxygen that is available will prefer to react with the hydrogen and carbon of the fuel,<br>
and not with nitrogen. Rich combustion is also very desirable, because it is very<br>
stable and readily ignitable. Generally, the rich flammability limits are wider than<br>
10<br>
lean limits, and flame temperature does not drop as fast when made richer, compared<br>
to lean combustion made leaner. Rich combustion also produces high power flux<br>
densities, because of the large amount of energy released compared to the air mass<br>
flow rate. The main disadvantages of rich combustion are: 1) not all of the fuel is<br>
fully reacted, resulting in decreased thermal efficiency, and 2) high concentration of<br>
unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust. The stability of rich<br>
combustion and the high power density make rich combustion acceptable for many<br>
applications where emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are<br>
less of an issue and high power per weight ratio is highly desirable. Generally, it is<br>
not a trend to use rich combustion alone for industrial power generation, because<br>
significantly lower emissions levels are achieved during lean operation.<br>
The Rich Quench Lean concept is a method of burning rich to gain the<br>
stability of rich combustion without the formation of excessive levels of NOx, and<br>
then transitioning to lean combustion to complete the combustion process. NOx<br>
emissions are not produced during the rich combustion, because there is insufficient<br>
oxygen and NOx is not formed during the lean combustion because the temperature is<br>
low. The combustion temperature is low for the lean combustion, because the extra<br>
air cannot react, does not produce heat, but must be heated by the fuel and air that<br>
does react. The key or critical issue associated with successful Rich-Quench-Lean<br>
combustion is the quench process. In the transition from rich to lean the mixture must<br>
pass through the stoichiometric ideal mixture where the flame temperature is<br>
maximized and NOx can be produced. These reactions at stoichiometric conditions<br>
will occur very fast because of the high temperatures and large pool of free radicals<br>
that exist as the result of the previous rich combustion. If the quench process does not<br>
occur very fast, high levels of NOx emissions will result from high temperature<br>
combustion occurring during the quench process.<br>
11<br>
Referring again to Figs. 2 and 3, A RQL combustor or pilot 210 is used as a<br>
pilot injector located on the centerline X-X of a swirl stabilized lean partially<br>
premixed burner/combustor 200. The RQL combustor/pilot 210 supplies<br>
supplemental high concentrations of free radicals and heat directly to the forward,<br>
stagnation point 212 and shear layer where the lean premixed flow mixes with hot<br>
gases of the main recirculation zone 214. In this invention a central bluff body flame<br>
holder 216, at the exit 218 of the RQL combustor/pilot 210, is used to stabilize the<br>
location of the forward stagnation point 212 of the main recirculation zone 214 which<br>
helps to stabilize and enables continuous combustion of the main premixed fuel and<br>
air.<br>
The flame holder 218 also functions, in this invention, to supply the quench auto<br>
the quench section 242 of the RQL pilot 210. From the opposite wall 244 in the<br>
quench section 242, additional quench air can be supplied to intensify the quenching<br>
process. These features are best illustrated in Fig. 2. The flame holder 218 in the<br>
center of the RQL pilot 210 makes the exit 218 of the RQL pilot an annular passage.<br>
This makes the RQL pilot flow passage in the quench section 242 narrow with a high<br>
surface area, making the quench more effective. The high surface area allows for<br>
many jets of air to be used in the quench process. The narrow gap of the RQL quench<br>
flow passage 222 limits the distance that the quench jets must penetrate. The scale of<br>
the quench process must be kept small and the velocity of the flow high in order to<br>
limit the time period where the mixture is at stoichiometric conditions. The mixing in<br>
the quench process must be rapid and thorough; streaks of rich or stoichiometric<br>
mixture exiting the quench section 242 would result in high local flame temperatures.<br>
The quench process at the exit 218 of the RQL pilot 210 must be rapid<br>
because of the large concentration of the free radicals that emerge from the rich<br>
combustion process. The large free radical pool makes the induction time for the<br>
initiation of the reaction of the remaining unburned hydrocarbons very rapid when<br>
mixed with additional oxygen from the air during the quenching process. The<br>
dimensional scale and turbulence scale of the quench must be small when air is used<br>
as the quench medium. This makes it difficult to use Rich-Quench-Lean combustion<br>
as the primary form of combustion in large gas turbines that require high volumetric<br>
flow rates.<br>
The very large pool of free radicals that emerge from an RQL system, which<br>
makes large scale quenching difficult, is also what makes the RQL an ideal pilot for<br>
lean premixed combustion. The high concentration of free radicals in the RQL pilot<br>
exhaust will support rapid and stable combustion in very lean main swirl stabilized<br>
combustion that would otherwise be too lean and at too low of temperature to be<br>
stable. The ability to operate very lean without engine flameout is a very useful<br>
characteristic for engine startup and to handle rapid engine load changes without overspeeding<br>
the engine.<br>
In swirl stabilized combustion, the process is initiated and stabilized by means<br>
of transporting heat and free radicals from the previously combusted fuel and air, back<br>
upstream towards the flame front. If the combustion process is very lean, as is the<br>
case in lean-partially premixed combustion systems, the combustion temperature is<br>
low, resulting in very low equilibrium levels of free radicals. Complicating this issue<br>
is that at high engine pressures the free radicals produced by the combustion process<br>
quickly relax to the equilibrium level that corresponds to the temperature of the<br>
combustion products. This is due to the fact that the rate of this relaxation of the free<br>
radicals to equilibrium levels increases exponentially with increasing pressure, while<br>
on the other hand the equilibrium level of free radicals decreases exponentially with<br>
decreasing temperature.<br>
The higher the level of free radicals available for initiation of combustion, the<br>
more rapid and stable the combustion process will tend to be. At the high pressures,<br>
13<br>
which modern Gas Turbines operate in, the relaxation time of the free radicals can be<br>
short compared to the "transport" time required for the free radicals to be convected<br>
downstream, from the point where they were produced in the shear layer of the main<br>
recirculation zone, back upstream, towards the flame front and the forward stagnation<br>
point of the main recirculation zone. As a consequence, by the time the re-circulating<br>
flow within the main recirculation zone has convected free radicals back towards the<br>
flame front where they mix and initiate combustion of the incoming "fresh" premixed<br>
lean fuel and air mixture at the forward stagnation, the free radicals could have<br>
reached such a low equilibrium level that stable combustion is not initiated.<br>
In this invention, the scale of the RQL pilot is kept small and most of the<br>
combustion of fuel occurs in the lean premixed main combustor 240, and not in the<br>
RQL pilot combustor 210. The RQL pilot 210 can be kept small, because the free<br>
radicals are released near the forward stagnation point 212 of the main recirculation<br>
zone214. This is generally the most efficient location to supply additional heat and<br>
free radicals to swirl stabilized combustion. Because the free radicals and heat<br>
produced by the RQL pilot combustor 210 are used efficiently, its size can be small<br>
and the quenching process can be effective.<br>
Burner 200 utilizes high non-equilibrium levels of free radicals to stabilize the<br>
main lean combustion. Because the outlet of the RQL quench is at the forward<br>
stagnation point 212of the recirculating flow, the time scale between quench and<br>
utilization of free radicals is very short, not allowing free radicals to relax to low<br>
equilibrium levels. The flame holder 216 maintains the forward stagnation point 212<br>
at the exit of the quench section 242 of the pilot 210 or quencher to assure the<br>
distance and time from quench to mixing of the free radicals with the premixed fuel<br>
and air is as short and direct as possible. This is very advantageous for high-pressure<br>
gas turbine engines, which inherently exhibit severe thermoacoustic instabilities.<br>
Aero gas turbine engines have high-pressure ratios in order to maximize their power<br>
to weight ratio. This invention will be most advantages to these aero engines, aero<br>
derivative industrial engine that also operate at high pressure, as well as high-pressure<br>
industrial engines.<br>
This invention also allows for the ignition of the main combustion to occur at<br>
the forward stagnation point 212 of the main recirculation zone 214. Most gas turbine<br>
engines must use the outer recirculation zone (see Fig. 1) as the location where the<br>
spark, or torch igniter, ignites the engine. Ignition can only occur if stable<br>
combustion can also occur; otherwise the flame will just blow out immediately after<br>
ignition. The inner or main recirculation zone 214 is generally more successful at<br>
stabilizing the flame, because the recirculated gas is transported back to a point<br>
region, instead of a ringed region about the outside of the main premixed flow. The<br>
heat from the recirculated combustion products is focused to a small region at the<br>
forward stagnation point 212 of the main recirculation zone 212. The combustion<br>
also expands outward in a conic shape from this forward stagnation point, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3. This conic expansion downstream allows the heat and free<br>
radicals generated upstream to support the combustion downstream allowing the<br>
flame front to widen as it moves downstream. The center bluff body flame holder 216<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2, compared to swirl stabilized combustion without the center bluff<br>
body flame holder shown in Fig. 1, shows how the flame holder 216 shapes the flame<br>
to be more conic and less hemispheric in nature. The more conic flame front allows<br>
for a point source of heat to initiate combustion of the whole flow field effectively.<br>
This source of heat and free radicals can either be the recirculated hot combustion<br>
product, the RQL pilot 210, or both in combination.<br>
When the igniter is placed in the outer recirculation zone, the fuel/air mixture<br>
entering this region must often be made rich in order to make the flame temperature<br>
sufficiently hot to sustain stable combustion in this region. The flame then often<br>
cannot be propagated to the main recirculation until the main premixed fuel and<br>
airflow becomes sufficiently rich, hot and has a sufficient pool of free radicals, which<br>
occurs at higher fuel flow rates. When the flame cannot propagate from the outer<br>
recirculation zone to the inner main recirculation zone shortly after ignition, it must<br>
propagate at higher pressure after the engine spee4 begins to increase. This transfer<br>
of the initiation of the main flame from the outer recirculation zone pilot only after<br>
combustor pressure begins to rise results in more rapid relaxation of the free radicals<br>
to low equilibrium levels, which is an undesirable characteristic that is counter<br>
productive for ignition of the flame at the forward stagnation point of the main<br>
recirculation zone. Ignition of the main recirculation may not occur until the pilot<br>
sufficiently raises the bulk temperature to a level where the equilibrium levels of free<br>
radicals entrained in the main recirculation zone and the production of addition free<br>
radicals in the premixed main fuel and air mixture are sufficient to ignite the main<br>
recirculation zone. In the process of getting the flame to propagate from the outer to<br>
the main recirculation zone, significant amounts of fuel exits the engine without<br>
burning from the un-ignited main premixed fuel and air mixture. A problem occurs if<br>
the flame transitions to the main recirculation zone in some burner before others in the<br>
same engine, because the burners where the flame stabilized on the inside burn hotter<br>
since all of the fuel is burnt This burner-to-burner temperature variation can damage<br>
engine components. This invention ignites the main recirculation zone directly with<br>
the RQL pilot 210, avoiding these problems. The RQL pilot 210 is easy to ignite<br>
because the mixture within the RQL pilot combustor 210 can be rich upon ignition<br>
without having to make the entire engine rich.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the inventive<br>
aspects of this disclosure can be applied to any type of combustor or burner, such as a<br>
solid fuel burner or furnace.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
