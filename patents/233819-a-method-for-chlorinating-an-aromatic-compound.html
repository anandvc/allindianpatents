				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the chlorination of aromatic compounds. More particularly, it relates to chlorination methods and catalyst compositions capable of producing predominantly p-chloro isomers.<br>
Chlorination of such aromatic compounds as toluene and xylenes is a known reaction affording useful compounds. The most useful of these compounds for many purposes are the p-chloro compounds. p-Chlorotoh'ene, for example, is an intermediate capable of conversion into many useful chemicals. The same is true of p-chloro-o-xyJene; i.e., 4-chloro-l,2-dimethylbenzene. A principal utility of the latter compound is its conversion by oxidation to 4-chlorophthalic acid, which is in turn an important intermediate in the production of polyetherimides.<br>
However, the production of these highly desirable chlorinated compounds is complicated by the simultaneous production of numerous not so desirable by products. Thus, chlorination of toluene and xylenes produces the p-monochloro isomer in admixture with other isomers such as o-chlorotoluene and 3-chloro-l,2-dimethylbenzene. In addition, numerous polychlorinated products are ordinarily obtained.<br>
Many of the known methods for chlorination of aromatic compounds employ elemental chlorine in combination with Lewis acids, chiefly the Lewis acids known in the art as useful in Friedel-Crafts reactions including alkylation and acylation. The use of such catalytic species as ferric chloride, antimony trichloride, antimony pentachloride, zinc chloride and aluminum chloride is conventional.<br>
However, the use of such catalysts in no way resolves the problems of isomer distribution and polychlorination. Various publications, including many U.S. patents, go further in describing mixed catalyst systems in which another catalyst component is an organosulfur compound. The organosulfiir compounds disclosed in these publications are of very diverse structures. Many of them are phenoxathiins or<br><br>
thianthrenes. Illustrative patents with such disclosures are U.S. Patent Nos. 3,226,447, 4,031,142, 4,031,147, 4,190,609, 4,250,122, 4,289,916, 4,647,709 and 4,925,994. Lewis acid proportions employed according to many of these disclosures are quite low, typically on the order of 0.01% by weight based on aromatic compound being chlorinated.<br>
US Patent 4,017,551 discloses the chlorination of benzene or monochlorobenzene in the presence of iron-free manganese chloride. No second catalyst component is disclosed.<br>
In European patent application 126,669, a further class of catalyst systems is disclosed. It comprises a Lewis acid known to be useful for this purpose, preferably a chloride of iron or antimony, in combination with an .N-substituted phenothiazine. Among the substituted phenothiazines disclosed is phenothiazine N-carbonyl chloride. It has been found, however, that such combinations are still somewhat deficient in that they tend to form polychloro compounds and monochloro compounds other than the p-isomer.<br>
Soviet patent 654,602 discloses the chlorination of toluene in the presence of a<br>
chloride of copper, cobalt or nickel on a solid support. The chlorination requires vapor phase conditions and temperatures in the range of 400-450°C. Such conditions are far from ideal for commercial practice.<br>

and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent with reference to<br>
the following description and appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION; PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Any aromatic compound may be chlorinated by the method of this invention. Included are monocyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons and substituted derivatives thereof. For the most part, the chlorination of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is<br>
contemplated. Such hydrocarbons include benzene, toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene and 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. It is preferred that the aromatic hydrocarbon contain at least one CM alkyl substituent, preferably methyl, and that a p-position with respect to one of the alkyl groups be free from substituents of any kind. Most preferred are toluene and o-xylene.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the aromatic compound is contacted with chlorine in the presence of a catalyst combination to effect reaction. Contact may be by bubbling chlorine through the liquid aromatic compound, optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent although no solvent is ordinarily necessary. In one embodiment the reaction takes place preferably in the liquid phase rather than in the vapor phase.<br>
For the sake of brevity, the constituents of the catalyst combination are defined as "components" irrespective of whether a reaction involving said constituents occurs before or during the chlorination reaction. Thus, the catalyst system combination may include the reaction products derived from at least one of the components.- Said reaction products may comprise chlorine. Said reaction products may or may not be in admixture with one or more unreacted components remaining in the catalyst combination. Generally, the catalyst combination is obtained by combining components (A) and (B). Component A of the catalyst combination is at least one compound, most often a salt, of a metal selected from Groups 4-12, a lanthanide or an actinide of the Periodic Table of Elements. In some specific embodiments said metal is at least one member selected from the group consisting of copper, nicke), cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, zirconium, titanium, vanadium, niobium, palladium or platinum. Said salt may be of an.inorganic acid; illustrative salts of this type are cupric sulfate, nickel chloride, cobalt(lll) chloride and manganese(II) chloride. Preferably, however, the salt is one which is at least somewhat soluble in the reaction medium. Included in this subcategory are salts wherein the anion is derived from an acidic organic compound, said salt having at least some solubility in a hydrophobic, organic solvent. Illustrative examples of such acidic organic compounds include, but are not limited to, those with an approximate pKa value relative to water in one embodiment of at least about 3, in another embodiment of at least about 4, in another embodiment of at least about 5, in another embodiment of at least about 6, in another embodiment of at least about 7, in another embodiment of at least about 8, and in still<br>
another embodiment of at least about 9. In some embodiments said anion is derived from-a carboxylic acid or 2,4-dione, or a derivative thereof. By "2,4-dione" is meant a dicarbonyl compound, including, but not limited to, a diketone or a beta-ketoester in which a carbon atom separates the two carbonyl groups, irrespective of the placement of said carbonyl groups in the molecule. Illustrative examples of derivatives of carboxylic acids or 2,4-diones include halogenated derivatives and particularly chlorinated or fluorinated derivatives. Examples of salts suitable as component A include, but are not limited to, cupric acetate, cupric 2,4-pentanedionate, cupric l,l,l,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionate, cupric benzoate, nickel acetate, nickel 2,4-pentanedionate, nickel 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate, cobalt(ll) acetate, cobalt(II) stearate, cobalt(II) 2,4-pentanedionate, manganese(II) acetate, manganese(II) stearate and manganese(II) 2,4-pentanedionate. Copper salts are usually preferred. Combinations of various salts are also useful.<br>
Component B is at least one organic sulfur compound. Suitable compounds include dialkyl and diaryl sulfides, dialkyl and diaryl disulfides, alkyl and aryl mercaptans, phenoxathiin, thiophene, dibenzothiophene, thianthrene and phenothiazine, including substituted derivatives thereof. Component B may also be a mixture of organic sulfur compounds.<br>
A particularly preferred sulfur compound is phenothiazine-N-carbonyl chloride, having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It may be synthesized by known methods such as the reaction of phenothiazine with phosgene. Also particularly effective is N-trifluoroacetylphenothiazine. Aromatically substituted analogs of the above, especially chlorinated analogs such as<br>
2-chloro-N-trifluoroacetylphenothiazine	and<br>
2-trifluoromethyl-N-trifluoroacetylphenothiazine, are also effective.<br>
The method of the invention may be performed by simply contacting a mixture of the<br>
aromatic compound, component A and component B with chlorine, preferably in the<br>
liquid phase, most often at a temperature in the range of about	0-100°C,<br>
preferably about 5-50°C and most preferably below 25°C. Preferably, the reaction mixture is protected from air by contact with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, and is shielded from exposure to ambient light to minimize chlorination of any alkyl side chains on the aromatic compound. The term "light" in this context means radiation in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.<br>
On a preparative scale, contact is preferably accomplished by passing at least a portion, and more preferably substantially all, the chlorine through the mixture; however, for screening purposes it is often convenient to charge the chlorine to the head space of the reaction system, removing by-product HC1 by applying a slight vacuum. Pressure may vary from said slight vacuum to superatmospheric, typically up to about 10 arm although superatmospheric pressure is generally not necessary. It is also within the scope of the invention to generate chlorine in situ from a reagent such as thionyl chloride.<br>
On a preparative scale, chlorine can simply be passed into the mixture with periodic sampling until the desired or maximum amount of the desired p-monochloro product<br>
i<br>
has been produced, as determined by art-recognized analytical methods; for example, by gas chromatography. Reactions may employ an excess, typically up to about a 50% and preferably a 10-30% stoichiometric excess of chlorine.<br>
The proportion of component A is typically in the range of about 0.005-10.0% and of component B in the range of about 0.005-10.0% by weight based on.aromatic compound; preferably, these ranges are respectively about 0.01-5.0% and about 0.01-0.1%, and most preferably 0.07-3.0% and about 0.05-0.1%. For the most part, higher proportions of component A are employed than of art-recognized Lewis acid catalysts such as ferric chloride. On the other hand, the proportion of component B according to the invention is generally lower relative to component A than is tine with art-<br><br>
recognized catalysts. The weight ratio of component A to component B is in various embodiments ,in a range of between about 2000:1 and 1:2000. The ratio of component A to component B is in some particular embodiments in a range of between about 2:1 and about 100:1; in other embodiments in a range of between about 3:1 and about 80:1; and in still other embodiments in a range of between about 3:1 and about 70:1.<br>
While die present invention is not dependent in any way on theory or reaction mechanism, it is believed that these differences in proportion of metal compound are the result of different reaction mechanisms. With a relatively strong Lewis acid such as ferric chloride, it is believed that complex formation with component B minimizes the level of acid which can produce non-selective aromatic ring chlorination; said complex, on the other hand, itself promotes selective chlorination 'with production of the p-isomer.<br>
The Lewis acids employed according to the present invention, by contrast, are relatively weak and their presence in relatively large proportions is not as likely to afford non-selective aromatic chlorination,,although selectivity is improved by the presence of component B. At low Lewis acid levels, however, side chain chlorination predominates to yield products that are undesirable for the purposes of the invention. Moreover, it is believed that an intermediate stage of the reaction is the chlorination of component A to form a relatively non-catalytic species, necessitating the use of a relatively high concentration thereof to compensate. Thus, reaction products of the catalyst components include those reaction products with chlorine of one or more catalyst components or intermediates derived from one or more catalyst components. Given these differences in behavior of the Lewis acids employed in this invention and the stronger prior art Lewis acids, it would in no way have been predictable that the Lewis acids employed in the invention would be effective, or in what proportions.<br>
In situations where conditions are optimized for production of the desired p-chloro isomer, it may be possible to employ the chlorination product of the method of the invention directly for further purposes, for example as a chemical intermediate, without further purification. Sometimes, however, further purification is desirable or necessary. It may be achieved by the use of one or more conventional purification<br>
techniques, including fractional distillation, fractional crystallization and preparative-scale chromatographic methods.<br>
It is also frequently possible to recover the catalyst combination from the chlorination reaction mixture for repeated use in subsequent reactions. This may be done by removing, at least in part, all other materials, typically by distillation.<br>
The catalyst compositions taught herein may be employed for any reaction catalyzed by (1) the combination of (A) at least one salt comprising a metal selected from the group consisting of a Group 4-12 metal, lanthanides and actinides; and an organic counterion derived from at least one acid.ic organic compound selected from the group consisting of those with an approximate pKa value relative to water of at least about 3; and (B) at least one organic sulfur compound, or (2) a reaction product comprising (A) and (B), or (3) the components (A); (B) and a reaction product comprising at least one of (A) or (B). Illustrative applications of said catalyst compositions include, but are not limited to, halogenation, chlorination and Friedel-Crafts reactions.<br>

EXAMPLES 1-5<br>
Screening runs were performed at 10°C and atmospheric pressure in a 48-well aluminum block reactor enclosed in a light box for protection against ambient radiation. Stirred, argon-purged glass vials containing 352 mg (3.3 mmol) of xylene, various proportions of copper(II) salts (in wt. % based on xylene) and 0.02 wt. % (based on xylene) of PNCC were placed in the reactor wells. Vials were individually stirred. Chlorine (120 mole percent based on xylene) was added to the head space of each vial for 20 minutes via a polytetrafluoroethylene gas manifold, and MONEL tubes, 1 .59 mm OD. Vacuum was applied to eliminate excess chlorine as v.'ell as HC1 formed in the reaction. At the end of the reaction time, residual chlorine in the vials was eliminated by purging the vials with argon for 30 minutes. The composition of the reaction mixture in each vial was determined by gas chromatography.<br>
The results are given in Table 1, in comparison with Control 1 in which the copper salt was replaced by 0.01% of ferric chloride. "Conversion" is the percentage of xylene converted to chlorinated products. The abbreviation "mono-Cl" designates the amount of aromatically monochlorinated products (i.e., products in which the aromatic ring is monochlorinated as opposed to those in which the side chain is chlorinated) as a percentage of total chlorinated products, and "4-C1" designates the amount of the 4-monochloro (p-chloro) isomer as a percentage of total aromatically monochlorinated products.<br>

Xylene (6.9 g, 65 mmol), PNCC (0.1 wt.%) and CuFPD (1.5 wt.%) were charged to an argon-purged flask which was screened from ambient light. The mixture was cooled to 10°C and flushed with argon. Chlorine was bubbled into the mixture at constant flow rate for 35 minutes, with periodic analysis by gas chromatography. Conversion, mono-Cl and 4-C1 levels at 25 minutes were 77.0%, 98.5% and 80%, respectively, and at 30 minutes 94.8%, 96%, 81%, respectively. In Control 2 employing 0.01% ferric chloride in place of the CuFPD, these values at 25 minutes were 68%, 99%, and 72%, respectively, and at 30 minutes 89%, 95.9% and 74.6% respectively.<br>
