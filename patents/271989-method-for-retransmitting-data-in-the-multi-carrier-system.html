[invention Title]<br>
method for/Retransmitting data in the multi-carrier system<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-carrier<br>
system, and more particularly to a retransmission method<br>
for use in the multi-carrier system.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A mobile communication system allows each base<br>
station or Node-B located in a single cell or sector to<br>
communicating with a plurality of user terminals (e.g.,<br>
user equipments) over a wireless channel environment.<br>
In the case of a multi-carrier system or other<br>
systems similar to the multi-carrier system, the base<br>
station receives packet traffic from a wired Internet<br>
network in the multi-carrier system or other similar<br>
systems, and transmits the received packet traffic to<br>
each terminal using a predetermined communication scheme.<br>
In this case, the base station determines a<br>
downlink scheduling, so that it determines a variety of<br>
information according to the downlink scheduling, for<br>
example, a user terminal which will receive data from the<br>
base station, a frequency area to be used for data<br>
 <br>
transmission to the terminal, and timing information<br>
indicating a transmission time of the data to be<br>
transmitted to the terminal.<br>
The base station receives packet traffic from the<br>
user terminal according to a predetermined communication<br>
scheme, and demodulates the received packet traffic, so<br>
that it transmits the received packet traffic to the<br>
wired Internet network.<br>
The base station determines an uplink scheduling,<br>
so that it determines a variety of information according<br>
to the uplink scheduling, for example, a user terminal<br>
which will transmit uplink data, a frequency band to be<br>
used for the uplink data transmission, and timing<br>
information indicating a transmission-time of the uplink<br>
data. Generally, a user terminal having a superior or<br>
good channel status is scheduled to transmit/receive data<br>
using more frequency resources during a longer time.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a time-<br>
frequency resource block for use in a multi-carrier<br>
system.<br>
Communication resources for use in a multi-carrier<br>
system or other similar systems can be largely divided<br>
into a time area and a frequency area.<br>
 <br>
The communication resources can be defined by<br>
<br>
resource blocks. Each resource block includes N sub-<br>
carriers and/or M sub-frames, and is configured in units<br>
of a predetermined time. In this case, N may be set to<br>
"1", and M may also be set to "1".<br>
A single square of FIG. 1 indicates a single<br>
resource block. A single resource block uses several sub-<br>
carriers as a single axis, and uses a unit of a<br>
predetermined time as another axis.<br>
A base station in a downlink selects a user<br>
terminal according to a predetermined scheduling rule,<br>
allocates one or more resource blocks to the selected<br>
user terminal. The base station transmits data to the<br>
selected user terminal using the allocated resource<br>
blocks.<br>
According to uplink transmission, the base station<br>
selects the user terminal, and allocates one or more<br>
resource blocks to the selected user terminal according<br>
to a predetermined scheduling rule. The user terminal<br>
receives scheduling information, indicating that a<br>
predetermined resource block has been allocated to the<br>
user terminal itself, from the base station, and<br>
transmits uplink data using the allocated resource.<br>
 <br>
Although data has been transmitted according to the<br>
scheduling rule, the data may be unexpectedly damaged or<br>
lost during the transmission process. In this case, there<br>
are proposed a variety method for controlling the faulty<br>
or erroneous operation, for example, an automatic repeat<br>
request (ARQ) scheme and a hybrid ARQ (HARQ) scheme, etc.<br>
The confirmation of the faulty or erroneous operation<br>
according to the above-mentioned two schemes is operated<br>
in frame units. Data transmitted during the frame unit is<br>
hereinafter referred to as a frame.<br>
The ARQ scheme waits for transmission of the ACK<br>
signal after transmitting a single frame. If a reception<br>
end correctly receives data of the frame, it transmits<br>
the ACK signal. However, if an unexpected error occurs in<br>
the frame, the reception end transmits a negative-ACK<br>
(NACK) signal, and deletes the received erroneous frame<br>
from its own buffer.<br>
If the transmission end receives the ACK signal, it<br>
transmits the next frame. Otherwise, if the transmission<br>
end receives the NACK signal, it retransmits the frame.<br>
The HARQ scheme allows the reception end to<br>
transmit the NACK signal to the transmission end on the<br>
condition that the received frame cannot be demodulated.<br>
However, differently from the ARQ scheme, the HARQ scheme<br>
 <br>
does not delete the pre-received frame from the buffer,<br>
and stores the pre-received frame in the buffer for a<br>
predetermined period of time. Therefore, if the above-<br>
mentioned frame is re-transmitted, in the HARQ scheme the<br>
reception end combines the pre-received frame with a re-<br>
transmitted frame, thereby it could increase the success<br>
rate of data reception.<br>
In recent time, many users prefer to the HARQ<br>
scheme to the basic ARQ scheme.<br>
There are a variety of types in the HARQ scheme.<br>
For example, the HARQ scheme can be classified into a<br>
synchronous HARQ scheme and an asynchronous HARQ scheme.<br>
If initial transmission of data fails, the<br>
synchronous HARQ scheme is designed to perform the next<br>
retransmission of data at a timing point determined by a<br>
system. For example, if it is assumed that the<br>
retransmission timing point is set to a fourth time unit<br>
after the initial transmission failure occurs, there is<br>
no need to additionally indicate the fourth time unit<br>
because the retransmission timing between the base<br>
station and the user terminal is pre-engaged.<br>
In other words, if the transmission end of data<br>
receives the NACK signal, it re-transmits the frame every<br>
fourth time unit until receiving the ACK signal.<br>
 <br>
In the meantime, the asynchronous HARQ scheme is<br>
performed by the newly-scheduled retransmission timing<br>
and the additional signal transmission. In other words, a<br>
timing point at which the previously-failed frame is re-<br>
transmitted is variable with a variety of factors such as<br>
a channel status.<br>
The HARQ scheme can be classified into a channel-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme and a channel-non-adaptive scheme<br>
according to information indicating whether a channel<br>
status is reflected in allocation of resources used for<br>
retransmission.<br>
The channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme (also called a<br>
non-adaptive HARQ scheme) enables resource blocks used<br>
for retransmission, and a MCS (Modulation and Coding<br>
Scheme) level defining frame modulation and coding<br>
methods to be operated according to a specific scheme<br>
predetermined by initial transmission.<br>
The channel-adaptive scheme (also called an<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme) allows the above-mentioned resource<br>
blocks and the MCS level to be variable with channels<br>
status information.<br>
For example, according to the channel-non-adaptive<br>
HARQ scheme, a transmission end transmits data using<br>
eight resource blocks during the initial transmission,<br>
 <br>
and then re-transmits the data using the same eight<br>
resource blocks irrespective of a channel status acquired<br>
by retransmission of the data.<br>
On the other hand, according to the channel-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme, although data is initially<br>
transmitted using 8 resource blocks, the data may also be<br>
re-transmitted using eight or less resource blocks or<br>
eight or more resource blocks according to the next<br>
channel status as necessary.<br>
According to the above-mentioned classification,<br>
the HARQ scheme may have four combinations of the HARQ<br>
schemes. According to unique characteristics of the<br>
above-mentioned schemes, the most preferred combinations<br>
of the HARQ schemes are an asynchronous channel-adaptive<br>
HARQ scheme, and a synchronous channel-non-adaptive<br>
scheme.<br>
Generally, the asynchronous channel-adaptive HARQ<br>
scheme adaptively changes a retransmission timing point<br>
and the amount of used resources to others according to a<br>
channel status, so that it can maximize the<br>
retransmission efficiency. In the meantime, the<br>
synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme has an<br>
advantage in that there is almost no overhead because the<br>
 <br>
retransmission timing and the resource allocation for<br>
retransmission are pre-engaged in a system.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
However, the above-mentioned asynchronous channel-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme has a disadvantage in that it<br>
unavoidably increases an amount of overhead, so that it<br>
is not generally considered for an uplink. And if the<br>
synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme is used<br>
under an excessively-changing channel status,<br>
retransmission efficiency is excessively decreased.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
retransmission method for use in a multi-carrier system<br>
that substantially obviates one or more problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
retransmission method in a multi-carrier system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method for indicating a retransmission request<br>
via an uplink scheduling message in a multi-carrier system.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method for determining whether there is an<br>
erroneous or faulty in an ACK/NACK signal at a reception<br>
end of the ACK/NACK signal.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the<br>
invention will be set forth in part in the description<br>
which follows and in part will become apparent to those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the<br>
following or may be learned from practice of the invention.<br>
The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed<br>
out in the written description and claims hereof as well as<br>
the appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied<br>
and broadly described herein, a retransmission method for a<br>
multi-carrier system comprising: receiving a grant message<br>
including scheduling information for transmitting uplink<br>
data wherein a retransmission scheme for the uplink data is<br>
predetermined by a first retransmission scheduling,<br>
transmitting the uplink data according to the scheduling<br>
information, and retransmitting the uplink data according<br>
to second retransmission scheduling by receiving the second<br>
retransmission scheduling information associated with the<br>
 <br>
uplink data with retransmission request.<br>
The second retransmission scheduling information may<br>
include changed information of at least one of a<br>
retransmission timing, retransmission resource blocks, a<br>
number of the retransmission resource blocks, and a<br>
transmission format of retransmission the second<br>
retransmission scheduling information with comparing with<br>
the first retransmission scheduling.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a retransmission method for a multi-carrier system<br>
comprising: receiving a grant message including scheduling<br>
information for transmitting uplink data, transmitting the<br>
uplink data according to the scheduling information,<br>
receiving a grant message indicating a retransmission of<br>
the uplink data, and retransmitting the uplink data.<br>
The grant message may include information indicating<br>
one of new data transmission and retransmission.<br>
The information indicating one of the new data<br>
transmission and the retransmission may apply a toggling<br>
scheme to change a current value of the information to<br>
another value if the new data transmission is indicated.<br>
The information indicating one of the new data<br>
transmission and the retransmission may be initialized if<br>
the new data transmission is indicated, or be changed<br>
 <br>
according to a predetermined rule if the retransmission is<br>
indicated.<br>
If a retransmission scheme for the uplink data is<br>
predetermined by a first retransmission scheduling and the<br>
grant message indicating the retransmission includes second<br>
retransmission scheduling information, the retransmission<br>
may be performed according to the second retransmission<br>
scheduling information.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a retransmission method for a multi-<br>
carrier system comprising: transmitting data, receiving an<br>
acknowledgement signal of the data; and determining whether<br>
an error occurs in the acknowledgement signal by referring<br>
to a scheduling message received after the acknowledgement<br>
signal.<br>
The method may further comprise: maintaining the<br>
data in a buffer even when the received acknowledgement<br>
signal is an affirmative acknowledgement (ACK) signal.<br>
Provided that the acknowledgement signal is the<br>
affirmative acknowledgement (ACK) signal, if the scheduling<br>
message indicates new data transmission, it may be<br>
determined that the acknowledgement signal has no error;<br>
and if the scheduling message indicates retransmission, it<br>
may be determined that the acknowledgement signal has an<br>
 <br>
error.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention,<br>

carrier system comprising: transmitting data, receiving an<br>
acknowledgement signal of the data, and maintaining the<br>
data in a buffer until receiving a scheduling message.<br>

message indicates a new data transmission, deleting the<br>
data from the buffer, and transmitting new data; and if the<br>
scheduling message indicates a retransmission,<br>
retransmitting the data.<br>
The acknowledgement signal may be at least one of an<br>
affirmative acknowledgement signal, a stop message, and a<br>
grant message.<br>
The grant message may include information indicating<br>
that there is no resource block allocated for the data<br>
retransmission.<br>
The acknowledgement signal may be transmitted to<br>
interrupt the retransmission if resources for<br>
retransmission data cannot be allocated at a predetermined<br>
retransmission timing of the data.<br>
The data may not be retransmitted at the<br>
predetermined retransmission timing, and is then<br>
retransmitted at the next retransmission timing.<br>
 <br>

If the retransmission method for the multi-carrier<br>
system is based on a synchronous retransmission scheme, the<br>
present invention can flexibly or smoothly schedule the<br>
retransmission timing point.<br>
Also, the present invention can more effectively<br>

Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of<br>
which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
 <br>
Prior to describing the present invention, it should<br>
be noted that most terms disclosed in the present invention<br>
correspond to general terms well known in the art, but some<br>
terms have been selected by the applicant as necessary and<br>
will hereinafter be disclosed in the following description<br>
of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the terms defined by the applicant be understood on the<br>
basis of their meanings in the present invention.<br>
For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, general structures<br>
and devices well known in the art will be omitted or be<br>
denoted by a block diagram or a flow chart. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
The following embodiments are proposed by combining<br>
constituent components and characteristics of the present<br>
invention according to a predetermined format. The<br>
individual constituent components or characteristics should<br>
be considered to be optional factors on the condition that<br>
there is no additional remark. If required, the individual<br>
constituent components or characteristics may not be<br>
combined with other components or characteristics. Also,<br>
some constituent components and/or characteristics may be<br>
combined to implement the embodiments of the present<br>
 <br>
invention. The order of operations to be disclosed in the<br>
embodiments of the present invention may be changed to<br>
another Some components or characteristics of any<br>
embodiment may also be included in other embodiments, or<br>
may be replaced with those of the other embodiments as<br>
necessary.<br>
The following embodiments of the present invention<br>
will be disclosed on the basis of a data communication<br>
relationship between the Node-B and the user equipment (UE).<br>
In this case, the Node-B is used as a terminal node of a<br>
network via which the Node-B can directly communicate with<br>
the user equipment (UE) .<br>
Specific operations to be operated by the Node-B in<br>
the present invention may also be operated by an upper node<br>
of the Node-B as necessary. In other words, it will be<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that various operations<br>
for enabling the Node-B to communicate with the user<br>
equipment (UE) in a network composed of several network<br>
nodes including the Node-B will be operated by the Node-B<br>
or other network nodes other than the Node-B.<br>
The term "Node-B" may be replaced with a fixed<br>
station, eNode-B (eNB), or an access point as necessary.<br>
The user equipment (UE) may also be replaced with a<br>
mobile station (MS) or a mobile subscriber station (MSS)<br>
 <br>
as necessary.<br>
FIG. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
general synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme<br>
capable of being applied to an uplink transmission.<br>
In the case of an uplink transmission, if the Node-<br>
B has a UE, which will transmit data to implement the<br>
UE's initial transmission, the Node-B informs the UE of<br>
wireless resource information and timing information to<br>
be used for the UE's data transmission, so that it<br>
generally transmits a scheduling message for allowing the<br>
UE's data transmission to the UE. The above-mentioned<br>
scheduling message for allowing the UE's data<br>
transmission and informing scheduling information is<br>
hereinafter referred to as a grant message.<br>
The UE receives the grant message, acquires<br>
scheduling information, and transmits data to the Node-B<br>
according to the acquired scheduling information.<br>
In association with the transmitted (Tx) data, the<br>
UE normally receives acknowledgment signal of the Tx data<br>
from the Node-B, so that it may receive the ACK signal<br>
from the Node-B or may also receive the NACK signal<br>
requesting transmission of the data from the Node-B. If<br>
the UE receives the ACK signal, it deletes the Tx data<br>
from a buffer, and waits for a transmission of new data.<br>
 <br>
If the UE receives the NACK signal, it may retransmit the<br>
Tx data according to a retransmission scheme.<br>
In the case of data retransmission of a specific UE,<br>
which has transmitted data to an uplink at a specific<br>
time according to the synchronous channel-non-adaptive<br>
HARQ scheme, the retransmission timing is pre-engaged in<br>
a system. The resource block to be used for the<br>
retransmission and the transmission format are equal to<br>
those of the previous transmission.<br>
Therefore, it is sufficient that the grant message<br>
transmitted once from the Node-B should be transmitted to<br>
the UE for the initial transmission. The next<br>
retransmission may be operatedoperated by the ACK/NACK<br>
signal indicating whether data has been retransmitted or<br>
not without further informing retransmission timing<br>
information and resource blocks to be used for the<br>
retransmission.<br>
In the case of the synchronous channel-non-adaptive<br>
HARQ scheme, data retransmission can be operatedoperated<br>
by transmission/reception of the NACK signal without<br>
using additional scheduling information between the Node-<br>
B and the UE. In other words, if the UE receives the NACK<br>
signal from the Node-B while maintaining the initially-<br>
transmitted data in its own buffer, the UE can retransmit<br>
 <br>
data using the same frequency resources and MCS<br>
(Modulation and Coding Scheme) information as those of<br>
the initial transmission at a retransmission timing point<br>
having been predetermined before the retransmission.<br>
However, in the case of maintaining characteristics<br>
of the above-mentioned synchronous channel-non-adaptive<br>
HARQ scheme, a collision between the transmitted (Tx)<br>
data units may occur. In more detail, if the<br>
retransmission is operatedoperated by the synchronous<br>
channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme, situation like that<br>
urgent data, high-priority control signals, or persistent<br>
scheduling data should be transmitted at predetermined<br>
retransmission timing using predetermined retransmission<br>
resources can be occurred. In this case, if the UE, which<br>
will retransmit data using the synchronous channel-non-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme, retransmits the data using a<br>
corresponding resource at a pre-engaged timing point, a<br>
collision between Tx data units of different UEs may<br>
occur.<br>
FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
retransmission method for use in a multi-carrier system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to the embodiment of FIG. 3, the<br>
predetermined retransmission scheduling can be changed in<br>
 <br>
the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme based<br>
multi-carrier system, and retransmission can be operated<br>
according to the result of the changed retransmission<br>
scheduling.<br>
For the convenience of description, it is assumed<br>
that the UE retransmits data via a second HARQ.process in<br>
a 4-channel HARQ system, a first data is transmitted at<br>
TTI=1, and the data cannot be retransmitted at TTI=9<br>
which is a predetermined retransmission timing according<br>
to the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme.<br>
In this case, four HARQ processes having different<br>
retransmission timing points are defined in the 4-channel<br>
HARQ system, so that the 4-channel HARQ system allows the<br>
individual HARQ processes to perform the retransmission<br>
process during the same interval.<br>
The aforementioned four HARQ processes are shown as<br>
index 0 ~ index 3 respectively, in the center part of FIG.<br>
3. That is, the index 0 ~ index 3 in the center part of<br>
FIG. 3 is indicative of discriminating retransmission<br>
timing information of the UE employing the first HARQ<br>
process ~ the fourth HARQ process, respectively.<br>
For example, the UE scheduled to retransmit data by<br>
the second HARQ process retransmits corresponding data at<br>
 <br>
a timing of the first HARQ process. In other words, the<br>
UE can retransmit the data at TTI=1, TTI=5, and TTI=9.<br>
The Node-B transmits a grant message including<br>
scheduling information to the uplink-scheduled DE. In<br>
this case, the scheduling information informs a scheduled<br>
frequency band at a scheduled Tx time the uplink-<br>
scheduled UE to transmit uplink data. If the UE receives<br>
the grant message, the UE transmits data according to the<br>
scheduling information at the timing TTI=1.<br>
The grant message may include a UE identifier (ID)<br>
for identifying a corresponding UE, resource block (RB)<br>
allocation information, information of transmittable data,<br>
payload information, and transmission scheme information<br>
such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) information.<br>
The RB allocation information may be set to the<br>
number of RBs to be used by the above-mentioned UE,<br>
and/or the location information of the RBs. The above-<br>
mentioned transmittable data information may be set to<br>
the size of data capable of being transmitted from the UE<br>
receiving the grant message. The above-mentioned payload<br>
indicates a packet or frame part containing message data,<br>
differently from a header part of a general communication<br>
system.<br>
 <br>
If the incremental redundancy (IR) HARQ scheme is<br>
also used as the retransmission scheme, the grant message<br>
may further include the above-mentioned IR version<br>
information for data retransmission. The IR HARQ scheme<br>
from among various HARQ schemes performs channel encoding<br>
of information data to improve a data reception (Rx)<br>
performance, and transmits different coding bits whenever<br>
the retransmission is operatedoperated.<br>
The IR version information is associated with the<br>
number of retransmission times of the synchronous HARQ<br>
scheme, so that the transmission/reception end can<br>
tacitly recognize the IR version information. That is, in<br>
the case of using the synchronous HARQ scheme, the first<br>
IR version is used for a first transmission, a second IR<br>
version is used for a second retransmission, and a third<br>
IR version is used for a third retransmission, so that<br>
the number of retransmission times can be recognized by<br>
the IR version information.<br>
The Node-B receives data from the UE at the timing<br>
TTI-1, and determines whether retransmission of the data<br>
is required or not. If the data retransmission is no<br>
longer required, the Node-B transmits the ACK signal to<br>
the UE. Otherwise, if the data retransmission is required,<br>
the Node-B transmits the NACK signal to the UE.<br>
 <br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the Node-B transmits the NACK<br>
signal. It is assumed that the synchronous channel-non-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme is used, so that a reception (Rx) UE<br>
can perform data retransmission although the Node-B does<br>
not transmit additional retransmission scheduling<br>
information when transmitting the NACK signal.<br>
If the UE receives the NACK signal from the Node-B,<br>
it retransmits the data, which has been transmitted at<br>
the timing TTI=1, according to the second HARQ process at<br>
the timing TTI=5. In this case, as previously stated<br>
above, the UE retransmits data using resource blocks<br>
which have the same size and location information as<br>
those of the previous resource blocks used for the first<br>
transmission.<br>
The Node-B receiving the retransmitted (ReTx) data<br>
determines whether retransmission of the ReTx data is<br>
also required or not. As can be seen from FIG. 3, the<br>
Node-B transmits the NACK signal to the above-mentioned<br>
ReTx data.<br>
In this case, the base station according to the<br>
above-mentioned embodiment may change the retransmission<br>
scheduling to another. If the Node-B transmits the NACK<br>
signal to the UE so as to request retransmission of data,<br>
the Node-B performs scheduling so that the data can be<br>
 <br>
retransmitted using other transmission blocks during the<br>
retransmission according to the scheduling information.<br>
Then, the Node-B informs the UE of the changed scheduling<br>
information.<br>
In brief, the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ<br>
scheme is basically maintained, however, the<br>
retransmission timing information, the RB used for the<br>
retransmission, or the transmission scheme is changed to<br>
another, so that the system flexibility increases.<br>
If the retransmission scheduling is changed to<br>
another according to the above-mentioned embodiment, the<br>
Node-B informs the UE of the changed scheduling<br>
information. The UE receives the NACK signal and the<br>
changed scheduling information from the Node-B, so that<br>
it will retransmit data according to the newly-received<br>
changed scheduling information, instead of the<br>
predetermined retransmission scheme.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, although data transmission is operatedoperated<br>
by the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme, the<br>
RB size and location information, the retransmission<br>
timing information, or the transmission scheme can be<br>
adaptively changed to others.<br>
 <br>
A method for retransmitting data by changing the RB<br>
used for the retransmission will hereinafter be described<br>
In FIG. 3, provided that the UE transmits data<br>
using the A resource block during the initial<br>
transmission and the first retransmission, the Node-B<br>
performs scheduling so that the data can be transmitted<br>
using the B resource block, instead of the A resource<br>
block, at the second retransmission timing according to<br>
the scheduling information. And, the Node-B informs the<br>
DE of information of the B resource block, so that the UE<br>
can transmit data using the B resource block at the<br>
second retransmission timing.<br>
Therefore, in this case, differently from the<br>
typical synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme<br>
designed to transmit the NACK signal without any<br>
retransmission scheduling information, the Node-B<br>
transmits retransmission scheduling information of the<br>
changed resource block (s) to the DE, so that the UE<br>
performs data retransmission over the B resource block.<br>
A variety of methods may be used to transmit the<br>
changed scheduling information. A message format capable<br>
of transmitting the changed scheduling information is<br>
newly defined, so that data can be transmitted over a<br>
control channel. Also, a conventional message format may<br>
 <br>
be extended or modified as necessary, so that the<br>
convenience message format may also be used to transmit<br>
the changed scheduling information. For example, the<br>
change scheduling information may be transmitted over the<br>
above-mentioned grant message.<br>
In the case of using the above-mentioned embodiment,<br>
if the Node-B must transmit data to another UE via the<br>
retransmission timing and the corresponding resource<br>
block (RB) , or must transmit other data of the<br>
corresponding DE, the collision problem between Tx data<br>
units can be solved.<br>
FIG. 4 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
retransmission method for use in a multi-carrier system<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a method for indicating whether data<br>
is retransmitted using a scheduling message (e.g., a<br>
grant message) on the condition of uplink data<br>
transmission.<br>
In this way, in the case where the Node-B transmits<br>
information of the changed resource block using the<br>
scheduling message, the scheduling message for the<br>
retransmission includes specific information<br>
corresponding to the NACK signal, so that there is no<br>
need to additionally transmit the NACK signal. According<br>
 <br>
to the above-mentioned embodiment of FIG. 4, it will be<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that the embodiment<br>
of FIG. 3 can also be applied to the embodiment of FIG. 4<br>
as necessary.<br>
Similar to the embodiment of FIG. 3, the embodiment<br>
of FIG. 4 also assumes that the UE retransmits data via<br>
the second HARQ process in the 4-channel HARQ system, a<br>
first data is transmitted at TTI=1, and the data cannot<br>
be retransmitted at TTI=9 in the synchronous channel-non-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme based multi-carrier system.<br>
According to the above-mentioned embodiment of FIG.<br>
4, the Node-B may transmit a grant message instead of the<br>
NACK signal. Although FIG. 4 shows a method for<br>
indicating a reception acknowledgement using both the<br>
ACK/NACK signal and the grant message, the grant message<br>
instead of the ACK/NACK signal of FIG. 4 can be<br>
transmitted, so that the grant message can replace the<br>
ACK/NACK signal function.<br>
Although the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ<br>
scheme is applied to the embodiment of FIG. 4 in the same<br>
manner as in FIG. 3, data retransmission can be operated<br>
on the basis of the changed scheduling information.<br>
Specifically, the changed scheduling information is<br>
transmitted via the grant message according to the<br>
 <br>
embodiment of FIG. 4, so that the embodiment of FIG. 4<br>
can be more easily implemented.<br>
If the Node-B informs the UE of the changed<br>
scheduling information via the grant message, the MCS and<br>
information associated with other transmission schemes<br>
transmittable by the grant message can be transmitted in<br>
the same manner as in the initial transmission. Needless<br>
to say, the RB location, the number of used RBs, and the<br>
MCS level may be changed and transmitted. In this case,<br>
the MCS level is pre-defined between the Node-B and the<br>
UE according to the payload size of Tx data and the<br>
number of RBs.<br>
In this way, in order to request the UE to<br>
retransmit data using the grant message, it is preferable<br>
that the grant message transmitted from the Node-B may<br>
indicate whether new data transmission is requested or<br>
retransmission is requested.<br>
An exemplary method for allowing the UE to<br>
recognize which one of the new data transmission and the<br>
retransmission is requested by the Node-B will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for informing that a grant message indicating<br>
which one of new data transmission and retransmission is<br>
 <br>
requested in case that the grant message is used for<br>
requesting retransmission according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 5 adds an information bit<br>
composed of one or more bits as transmission type<br>
indication information, and indicates which one of the<br>
new data transmission and the retransmission is requested<br>
by the grant message using the added information bit.<br>
According to the present invention, the transmission type<br>
indication information is referred to as an NIB (New data<br>
Indicator Bit) composed of 1 bit.<br>
For example, if the grant message indicates the new<br>
data transmission as shown in FIG. 5, the NIB is set to<br>
"0", and then the grant message is transmitted with the<br>
NIB of "0". If the grant message indicates the<br>
retransmission as shown in FIG. 5, the NIB is set to "1",<br>
and then the grant message is transmitted with the NIB of<br>
"1". In other words, the DE receiving the grant message<br>
checks the NIB value, so that it can determine which one<br>
of the new data transmission and the retransmission is<br>
indicated by the grant message on the basis of the<br>
checked NIB value.<br>
In the meantime, an unexpected error occurs in<br>
reception of the grant message indicating the new data<br>
 <br>
transmission, so that the UE may be unable to recognize<br>
which one of the new data transmission and the<br>
retransmission is indicated by the following grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission.<br>
For example, although the Node-B transmits the<br>
grant message indicating the retransmission to the UE,<br>
the UE erroneously decodes the NACK signal of the<br>
previous Tx timing, so that it is unable to recognize<br>
whether the Node-B has transmitted the first grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission or has erroneously<br>
received the second grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission.<br>
A variety of retransmission methods in which the<br>
reception error of the grant message is considered will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for informing that a grant message indicating<br>
which one of new data transmission and retransmission is<br>
requested in case that the grant message is used for<br>
requesting retransmission according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 6 includes transmission type<br>
indication information, and indicates which one of the<br>
new data transmission and the retransmission is requested<br>
 <br>
by the grant message using the transmission type<br>
indication information. In this case, the toggling scheme<br>
for changing the value in a predetermined case is applied<br>
the transmission type indication information. As a result,<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 6 prepares against the reception<br>
error of the grant message. In FIG. 6, the transmission<br>
type indication information is also called "NIB" (New<br>
data Indicator Bit), and it is assumed that the NIB is<br>
composed of 1 bit.<br>
For example, if the grant message indicates the new<br>
data transmission as shown in FIG. 6, the NIB value may<br>
be changed to another value. The NIB value is set to "1"<br>
(i.e., NIB=1) as a grant message for indicating the new<br>
data transmission to specific data "Datal".<br>
Then, if the grant message indicates the new data<br>
transmission to another data vlData2", the NIB value is<br>
toggled to set to "0" (i.e., NIB=0) by the toggling<br>
scheme.<br>
In the case where the grant message indicating the<br>
retransmission is applied to the UE at the next<br>
retransmission timing, the value of NIB=0 remains<br>
unchanged, so that the UE can recognize the occurrence of<br>
the retransmission to the data "data2". In other words,<br>
 <br>
the NIB value is changed only when the grant message<br>
indicating the new data transmission.<br>
The UE receives the grant message, and determines<br>
whether the NIB value of the received grant message is<br>
different from another NIB value received in a previous<br>
HARQ process. If the NIB value of the received grant<br>
message is different from the other NIB value received in<br>
the previous HARQ process, this means that the grant<br>
message indicates the new data transmission, so that the<br>
DE deletes all of data from the buffer and transmits new<br>
data packet.<br>
And, if the NIB value of the grant message received<br>
in the UE is equal to the other NIB value received in the<br>
previous HARQ process, this means that the grant message<br>
indicates the retransmission, so that the UE retransmits<br>
the data packet stored in the buffer.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 6, the UE may unexpectedly<br>
miss the grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission. If a channel is in a deep fading status,<br>
the Node-B may detect only energy of a very low level. In<br>
this case, the Node-B transmits the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission.<br>
If the Node-B transmits the grant message according<br>
to the embodiment of FIG. 5, and the UE misses the grant<br>
 <br>
message, the above-mentioned UE may retransmit data to<br>
another data "Data1" instead of "Data2". However, if the<br>
toggling scheme is applied to the NIB value according to<br>
the present invention, the above-mentioned problem can be<br>
solved.<br>
For example, if the UE receives the first grant<br>
message indicating transmission of "Data2", the UE<br>
compares the NIB value of the grant message indicating<br>
the retransmission of "data2" with the NIB value of the<br>
previous grant message, confirms that the two NIB values<br>
are equal to each other, and performs retransmission of<br>
"data2" stored in the buffer.<br>
If the UE does not receive the initial grant<br>
message indicating the transmission of "data2", the UE<br>
compares the NIB value of the grant message indicating<br>
retransmission of "data2" with the other NIB value of a<br>
previous grant message, confirms that there is a<br>
difference between the two NIB values, deletes "datal"<br>
stored in the buffer, and begins to perform initial<br>
transmission of "data2". Namely, from the viewpoint of<br>
the UE, the above-mentioned operation is considered to be<br>
the initial transmission, however, from the viewpoint of<br>
the Node-B, the above-mentioned operation is considered<br>
to be reception of retransmission data.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 7 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for informing that a grant message indicating<br>
which one of new data transmission and retransmission is<br>
requested in case that the grant message is used for<br>
requesting retransmission according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 7 adds an information bit<br>
composed of one or more bits as sequence number<br>
information, and indicates which one of the new data<br>
transmission and the retransmission is requested by the<br>
grant message using the added information bit. According<br>
to the present invention, the sequence number information<br>
is referred to as a sequence number (SN).<br>
If the SN is added to the grant message and then<br>
the UE receives the resultant grant message including.the<br>
SN, the UE can recognize which one of the new data<br>
transmission and the retransmission is requested by the<br>
grant message, and can also recognize what one of data is<br>
retransmission-requested for by the grant message. A<br>
method for establishing the SN value according to the<br>
present invention is as follows.<br>
The SN information is transmitted along with the<br>
grant message, or is contained in the grant message and<br>
is then transmitted, without distinguishing between the<br>
 <br>
new data transmission and the retransmission. Whenever<br>
the Node-B receives a retransmission request of the same<br>
data packet, the SN value increases by "1". If the new<br>
data transmission is requested, the SN value is<br>
initialized to be an initial value.<br>
For example, it is assumed that the SN initial<br>
value is set to "0". In other words, in the case of<br>
transmitting the grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission, the SN value is set to "0". Therefore, if<br>
the SN value transmitted along with the grant message is<br>
not equal to the value of "0", the UE can recognize that<br>
the above-mentioned grant message indicates the<br>
retransmission.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, if the UE receives the grant<br>
message and the SN value of the received grant message is<br>
equal to "2", the UE performs retransmission of the<br>
initially-transmitted data before 8 sub-frames denoted by<br>
(2(SN) * 4 (HARQ channel) =8).<br>
However, provided that the SN value is not equal to<br>
"0" at a time at which the grant message is received, and<br>
at the same time is not equal to the other SN value,<br>
which should be received in association with current<br>
retransmitting data, i.e., provided that the just-before<br>
grant message is missed, the UE deletes all of data<br>
 <br>
stored in the buffer without retransmitting data of the<br>
previously-received grant message, and begins to perform<br>
the initial transmission of new data.<br>
In more detail, as can be seen from FIG. 7, if the<br>
UE misses or loses the grant message indicating the<br>
initial transmission of "data2", or if the UE detects<br>
energy of a very low level due to a deep-fading channel<br>
although data has been transmitted, the Node-B transmits<br>
a message indicating the retransmission along with the<br>
signal of SN=1.<br>
In this case, if the UE has not missed the previous<br>
grant message, it can be recognized that the SN value,<br>
which should be received in association with the current<br>
retransmission data, is not equal to "2". Therefore,<br>
since the SN=0 status is not established, the UE deletes<br>
all of data associated with "datal" from the buffer and<br>
performs retransmission of "data2", instead of performing<br>
retransmission of "datal"<br>
The "data2" instantaneous transmission operated by<br>
the UE may be considered to be the retransmission request<br>
from the viewpoint of the Node-B. However, if the UE has<br>
previously missed the grant message indicating the<br>
initial transmission of udata2", this means that the<br>
initial transmission of "data2" is operated from the<br>
 <br>
viewpoint of the UE. As a result, the UE may not wrongly<br>
recognize the retransmission data packet.<br>
FIG. 8 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for indicating a retransmission stop according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 8 assumes that the<br>
synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme and the<br>
second HARQ process are used in the same manner as in<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
In order to request the UE to stop the<br>
retransmission, the Node-B may exemplarily use a stop<br>
message, and a detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the Node-B transmits the grant<br>
message to the UE, so that it requests the UE to transmit<br>
data. The UE checks the received grant message, and<br>
performs uplink data transmission at the timing TTI=1.<br>
The Node-B checks the data transmitted from the UE.<br>
If retransmission of the data is required, the Node-B<br>
transmits the NACK signal to the UE. Upon receiving the<br>
NACK signal from the Node-B, the UE performs<br>
retransmission of the data at a predetermined timing<br>
according to the synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ<br>
scheme at TTI=5.<br>
 <br>
According to this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the Node-B transmits the stop message to the<br>
UE, so that it may stop the UE's retransmission at the<br>
next retransmission timing based on the synchronous non-<br>
adaptive HARQ scheme. The DE receiving the stop message<br>
does not perform retransmission at a predetermined timing<br>
TTI=9, does not delete data, having been transmitted at a<br>
previous timing, from the buffer, and keeps the above-<br>
mentioned data in the buffer. The UE receiving the stop<br>
message does not perform retransmission for a<br>
predetermined time, and does not delete data from the<br>
buffer. In this case, the predetermined time may be equal<br>
to two times the establish retransmission interval, or<br>
may be set to a time consumed until the UE receives<br>
specific information indicating either the new data<br>
transmission or the retransmission from the Node-B.<br>
Another method for requesting the UE to stop the<br>
retransmission may be a method for employing the above-<br>
mentioned grant message.<br>
The Node-B transmits information indicating no<br>
allocation RB to the UE via the grant message, so that it<br>
may request the UE to stop the retransmission in the<br>
synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ system. For example,<br>
when transmitting the number of RBs contained in the<br>
 <br>
grant message or the RB size information contained in the<br>
same grant message, the Node-B may include information of<br>
"0" in the transmitted information.<br>
If the Node-B stops the retransmission at the UE's<br>
reserved retransmission timing, then the Node-B may<br>
request retransmission via the same' HARQ process as that<br>
of the initial transmission. The Node-B re-allocates<br>
resource blocks (RBs) at the next retransmission timing<br>
corresponding to the same HARQ process, and transmits the<br>
RB information via the grant message indicating the<br>
retransmission, so that retransmission of corresponding<br>
data can be restated.<br>
Thereafter, the Node-B transmits the NACK signal<br>
requesting the retransmission to the UE, so that the QE<br>
retransmits the previously-transmitted data stored in the<br>
buffer at the next retransmission timing point TTI=13.<br>
In the meantime, if the UE receiving the stop<br>
message may receive the ACK signal from the Node-B within<br>
a predetermined time, or may not receive the ACK signal<br>
•within the predetermined time, it deletes data stored in<br>
the buffer, and may be ready to transmit new data.<br>
In this case, if there is no resource block to be<br>
allocated for the retransmission at the reserved<br>
retransmission because of other data transmitting, the US.<br>
 <br>
stops the retransmission for a little while, so that the<br>
retransmission can be more flexibly scheduled.<br>
FIG. 9 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for indicating a retransmission according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 9 discloses a method for<br>
performing the retransmission using a retransmission<br>
message. In this case of the embodiment of FIG. 9 it<br>
assumed that the synchronous non-adaptive HARQ scheme is<br>
basically applied to the above-mentioned method, and the<br>
second HARQ process is also applied to the above-<br>
mentioned method, so that the resultant data is<br>
retransmitted at a corresponding timing.<br>
Differently from the above-mentioned embodiments,<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 9 allows the Node-B to use a<br>
retransmission (ReTx) message to indicate the<br>
retransmission, and allows the Node-B to use the stop<br>
message to stop the retransmission in such a way that the<br>
retransmission process is operated. The ReTx message and<br>
the stop message are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
terms, and can also be replaced with other terms as<br>
necessary.<br>
The stop message of FIG. 9 is designed to perform<br>
the same function as the stop message of FIG. 8. The stop<br>
 <br>
message of FIG. 9 does not retransmit the previously-<br>
transmitted data, however, it requests the UE to maintain<br>
data in the buffer.<br>
The Node-B transmits a grant message for the new<br>
data transmission to the selected UE. The DE checks the<br>
grant message, and performs uplink transmission at TTI=1.<br>
If the Node-B checks data transmitted from the UE and<br>
determines the necessity of retransmission, and transmits<br>
the ReTx message for requesting the retransmission to the<br>
UE.<br>
The UE receiving the ReTx message performs<br>
retransmission of the previously-transmitted data. The<br>
stop message of FIG. 9 is equal to that of FIG. 8, so<br>
that its detailed description will herein be omitted for<br>
the convenience of description.<br>
Differently from FIG. 8, the embodiment of FIG. 9<br>
allows the Node-B to transmit the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission, so that the retransmission<br>
interrupted by the stop message is initiated as well as<br>
the ReTx message.<br>
In more detail, under the condition that the UE<br>
does not delete data from the buffer by receiving the<br>
stop message and does not perform the retransmission at<br>
predetermined retransmission timing due to the stop<br>
 <br>
message, if the above-mentioned UE receives the grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission, data kept in the<br>
buffer is retransmitted at TTI=13.<br>
In this case, if the UE receives the other grant<br>
message indicating the new data transmission instead of<br>
the retransmission, it resets the buffer, deletes data<br>
kept in the buffer, stores new data in the buffer, so<br>
that it may transmit the new data to the Node-B.<br>
Under the above-mentioned situation, there are two<br>
statuses, i.e., the retransmission status and the<br>
retransmission stop status, so that the Node-B can inform<br>
the UE whether the Node-B would retransmit data or would<br>
stop transmission of the data using a single bit. In<br>
other words, the Node-B informs the UE of the<br>
retransmission using the ReTx message, and informs the UE<br>
of the retransmission resumption using the stop message.<br>
If the received (Rx) packet is unsuccessfully<br>
demodulated, the Node-B transmits the ReTx message to the<br>
UE. However, if the Node-B desires to temporarily stop<br>
transmission of data applied to the UE at a predetermined<br>
retransmission timing irrespective of the success or<br>
failure of the demodulation, the Node-B transmits the<br>
stop message to the UE.<br>
 <br>
When the UE receives the stop message from the<br>
Node-B, it cannot immediately recognize whether the<br>
received stop message is caused by the success of<br>
reception, and cannot recognize whether the received stop<br>
message aims to temporarily prevent the data from being<br>
transmitted to the Node-B at a specific timing point.<br>
The UE stores data in the buffer for a<br>
predetermined time. If the above-mentioned UE receives<br>
the grant message indicating the retransmission from the<br>
Node-B, it retransmits the data stored in the buffer to<br>
the Node-B. Otherwise, if the above-mentioned UE receives<br>
the other grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission from the Node-B, the UE recognizes that the<br>
data stored in the buffer has been successfully received,<br>
i so that' it makes the buffer empty.<br>
Although the grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission is not transmitted from the Node-B, if the<br>
retransmission (RxTx) message is not transmitted from the<br>
Node-B for a predetermined time, the UE may delete the<br>
 transmitted (Tx) data from the buffer.<br>
As described above, the incremental redundancy (IR)<br>
HARQ scheme can be used for the HARQ scheme. If the<br>
synchronous non-adaptive HARQ scheme employing the stop<br>
message and the IR version management scheme are combined<br>
 <br>
with each other according to this embodiment, the<br>
misunderstanding of the IR version, corresponding to the<br>
retransmission action caused by the ReTx grant message<br>
located after the stop message, may occur.<br>
While the DE receives the message and attempts to<br>
perform the retransmission using the received message,<br>
the Rx error of the previously-transmitted stop message<br>
may occur. As a result, there arises the misunderstanding<br>
of information indicating how many retransmissions are<br>
between the OE and the Node-B. Namely, there arises the<br>
misunderstanding of information indicating which one of<br>
IR versions is applied to the retransmission, so that<br>
data reception may be abnormally operated.<br>
Therefore, if the Node-B transmits the grant<br>
message indicating the additional retransmission, the<br>
above-mentioned embodiment designates the IR version used<br>
for ReTx data, and transmits the RxTx data using the<br>
designated IR version.<br>
In this case, there is no change in the grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission, from among some<br>
field areas contained in the other grant message<br>
indicating the new data transmission using the<br>
synchronous non-adaptive HARQ scheme, so that some fields<br>
may not request the setup process. If the Node-B<br>
 <br>
transmits the IR version information using the above-<br>
mentioned fields in which the setup process is no longer<br>
required, it can transmit the IR version information<br>
without adding a new field to the grant message.<br>
For example, there is no change in payload size of<br>
Tx data based on the synchronous HARQ scheme, thus, if a<br>
payload field of the grant message indicating the new<br>
data transmission is transmitted as a ReTx grant message,<br>
the payload field is used as a field of information<br>
designating IR version. Therefore, although the<br>
retransmission is operated after the Node-B transmits the<br>
stop message, the correct IR version can be indicated, so<br>
that there could be no misunderstanding on the IR version.<br>
For another example, a method for resetting the IR<br>
version value to a predetermined value during the<br>
retransmission can be used. In other words, this method<br>
does not set the actual IR version value in consideration<br>
of the previous retransmission, but sets a predetermined<br>
value. Thus, if the Node-B transmits the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission after transmitting the stop<br>
message, the above-mentioned method resets the IR version<br>
value to the predetermined value, and transmits the<br>
resultant IR version value to a corresponding OB.<br>
 <br>
In this case, the Node-B can inform the UE of the<br>
reset IR version information using some fields, which are<br>
contained in the grant message indicating the new data<br>
transmission, without defining a new field.<br>
FIG. 10 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for transmitting a retransmission request message<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 10 shows a method for<br>
retransmitting data by changing a retransmission timing<br>
in the synchronous non-adaptive HARQ scheme based multi-<br>
carrier system. In order to allow the UE to perform<br>
retransmission of data, it is assumed that the second<br>
HARQ process is applied to the embodiment of FIG. 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the Node-B selects a UE which<br>
will perform uplink transmission, and transmits the grant<br>
message to the selected UE. The UE receives the grant<br>
message, and performs uplink transmission of data<br>
according to corresponding scheduling information at<br>
TTI=1.<br>
The Node-B receives Tx data from the UE. If the<br>
Node-B determines that the Tx data should be<br>
retransmitted from the UE, it transmit the ACK/NACK<br>
signal to the UE, so that the UE can recognize the<br>
presence or absence of a retransmission request.<br>
 <br>
It is assumed that the multi-carrier system in the<br>
above-mentioned embodiment of FIG. 10 employs the<br>
synchronous channel-non-adaptive HARQ scheme. If the UE<br>
receives the NACK signal from the Node-B, it retransmits<br>
the data at a predetermined timing TTI=5. Then, if<br>
retransmission of the data is required again, the Node-B<br>
transmits the NACK signal so that it requests the UE to<br>
perform the retransmission. In this case, the NACK signal<br>
is retransmitted at a predetermined timing TTI=9.<br>
However, this embodiment of FIG. 10 provides a<br>
method for changing a retransmission timing. In more<br>
detail, the Node-B cannot perform retransmission using<br>
the resource blocks (RBs), having been used for the<br>
ignition transmission, at a pre-engaged timing TTI=9, so<br>
that the Node-B requests the UE to perform the<br>
retransmission at another timing TTI=10. Thus, the Node-B<br>
transmits information of the changed timing to the UE,<br>
and the UE performs the retransmission at the changed<br>
timing.<br>
In the case of the synchronous HARQ-based system,<br>
the timing point, at which the ACK/NACK signal, the<br>
ReTx/Stop message, or the grant message is received, is<br>
correlated with the other timing point at which data is<br>
retransmitted as a response to each signal. In this way,<br>
 <br>
the retransmission timing point can be changed to another<br>
as necessary.<br>
For example, in the case of using the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission, the Node-B transmits the<br>
grant message to the UE at a specific timing (at which<br>
the retransmission can be executed) of the third HARQ<br>
process timing. In this case, the above-mentioned grant<br>
message must include information indicating that the<br>
currently-transmitted ReTx grant message requests<br>
retransmission of data associated with the third HARQ<br>
process instead of the second HARQ process.<br>
In order to perform the initial transmission and<br>
the first retransmission, the UE transmits data using the<br>
second HARQ process at corresponding timing intervals<br>
TTI=1 and TTI=5. However, during the second<br>
retransmission, the UE transmits data at the third HARQ<br>
process timing. After receiving the ReTx grant message<br>
including the changed HARQ process information, in order<br>
to reply to the ReTx grant message, the UE retransmits<br>
the data, which has been transmitted at the first HARQ<br>
process, at the timing TTI=10 corresponding to the third<br>
HARQ process.<br>
If transmission of high-priority data is requested<br>
by a corresponding resource block (RB) of a predetermined<br>
 <br>
timing, and the UE has difficulty in performing the<br>
retransmission using the predetermined timing and RB<br>
information, the above-mentioned operation enables the UE<br>
to effectively communicate with the Node-B.<br>
FIG. 11 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for simultaneously employing the retransmission<br>
stop request message and the retransmission request<br>
message according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 11 provides a method for<br>
more effectively performing the embodiment of FIG. 10<br>
designed to change the retransmission timing, using the<br>
stop message. According to this embodiment of FIG. 11, if<br>
the retransmission timing desired to be changed is later<br>
than the original scheduling timing, the embodiment of<br>
FIG. 11 transmits the stop message at the original<br>
retransmission timing.<br>
In FIG. 11, if the Node-B performing scheduling<br>
cannot allocate the corresponding resource block (RB) to<br>
the originally-scheduled UE at the timing TTI=9, the<br>
Node-B transmits the stop message to reserve the<br>
retransmission to be performed at the timing TTI=9. In<br>
this case, although the stop message does not request the<br>
UE to perform the retransmission, this stop message<br>
 <br>
enables the UE not to delete corresponding data from the<br>
buffer, so that the data is kept in the buffer, as<br>
previously stated above.<br>
The Node-B transmits the grant message for<br>
requesting the UE to perform the retransmission at the<br>
timing TTI=10 used as a retransmission indication timing.<br>
In this case, specific information, indicating that<br>
retransmission of the data having been transmitted to the<br>
second HARQ process is requested, is included in the<br>
above-mentioned grant message, so that the UE can<br>
correctly recognize which one of data is retransmission-<br>
requested by the Node-B.<br>
If the above-mentioned specific information,<br>
indicating that retransmission associated with the second<br>
HARQ process is requested, is not included in the<br>
aforementioned grant message, the UE recognizes that<br>
retransmission associated with the third HARQ process is<br>
requested at the timing TTI=10 according to the original<br>
setup status, so that it has difficulty in implementing a<br>
desired effect.<br>
If the retransmission timing is changed as<br>
described above, the Node-B is unable to provide the UE<br>
with correct information indicating whether data will be<br>
transmitted at the predetermined timing. So, if the UE<br>
 <br>
does not receive a retransmission request signal at a<br>
predetermined timing, it may wrongly decide whether or<br>
not to delete data from the buffer.<br>
However, if the Node-B according to the above-<br>
mentioned embodiment of FIG. 11 informs the UE of the<br>
stop message, so that it prevents data of the UE from<br>
being retransmitted at the predetermined timing. And,<br>
resulting in the implementation of no collision between<br>
the second HARQ process data and the third HARQ process<br>
data can be expected. In brief, a data retransmission<br>
method for changing a transmission timing (i.e., HARQ<br>
process) using the synchronous HARQ-based scheme can be<br>
more effectively performed.<br>
Compared with the method for scheduling the<br>
retransmission timing using the stop message, the above-<br>
mentioned method of FIG. 11 is superior to the above-<br>
mentioned method for scheduling the retransmission method.<br>
Namely, in order to maintain the synchronous non-<br>
adaptive HARQ characteristics, the UE must retransmit<br>
\ data according to a retransmission timing based on the<br>
second HARQ process. If the data is not retransmitted at<br>
the timing TTI=9, the UE must wait for the next<br>
retransmission timing TTI=13. However, a method for<br>
changing transmission process (i.e., retransmission<br>
 <br>
timing) is also used, so that the data can Jbe<br>
retransmitted at the timing TTI=10, resulting in no Tx<br>
time delay.<br>
If the Node-B desires to change the ReTx timing to<br>
another as described in FIGS. 10 and 11, it is preferable<br>
that the Node-B must determine which one of data is<br>
retransmission-requested, and must inform the UE of the<br>
determined result. In order to retransmit the changed<br>
ReTx information, the Node-B may inform the UE of the<br>
original HARQ process information of data to be<br>
retransmitted at the timing TTI=10.<br>
In this way, in order to inform the UE of the HARQ<br>
process information, a new message format is defined and<br>
used. If the Node-B transmits the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission, it may transmit the HARQ<br>
process information using a specific field from among<br>
fields contained in the grant message. In this case, the<br>
specific field has no need to be changed during the<br>
retransmission.<br>
For example, in the case of the grant message for<br>
transmitting new data and the ReTx grant message, there<br>
is no change in the payload size of Tx data, so that a<br>
field indicating the payload of the message for the new<br>
 <br>
data transmission may be used as the HARQ process<br>
indication field.<br>
For another example, in the case of using the grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission, a field for<br>
indicating the changed HARQ process information in the<br>
grant message may be added to the above-mentioned grant<br>
message as necessary. By the grant message indicating the<br>
retransmission, there is a change in the HARQ process<br>
during the retransmission. This HARQ process change can<br>
be provided on the assumption that the UE would not<br>
normally receive the above-mentioned retransmission grant<br>
message. Therefore, if the UE does not receive the ReTx<br>
grant message, an unexpected error may occur in overall<br>
operations. Therefore, the field indicating the HARQ<br>
process information is added to the above-mentioned grant<br>
message, so that the Node-B may allocate the HARQ process<br>
information to a resource allocation point for the new<br>
data transmission, irrespective of the Tx timing.<br>
" " If the retransmission is operated by the above-<br>
mentioned HARQ scheme, the reception end may have two<br>
kinds of errors (i.e., ACK-to-NACK error and NACK-to-ACK<br>
error) when receiving the ACK/NACK signal.<br>
The ACK-to-NACK error indicates a UE's erroneous<br>
decoding operation, in which the UE decodes the ACK<br>
 <br>
signal into the NACK signal due to a channel status or<br>
other factors although the Node-B has transmitted the ACK<br>
signal to reply to Tx data of a transmission end (e.g.,<br>
UE) .<br>
The NACK-to-ACK error indicates that the UE decodes<br>
the NACK signal into the ACK signal due to a channel<br>
status or other factors although the Node-B has<br>
transmitted the NACK signal for requesting the<br>
retransmission upon receiving Tx data from the UE.<br>
Operation schemes for employing the above-mentioned<br>
embodiments when the NACK-to-ACK error occurs will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
FIG. 12 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
general NACK-to-ACK error.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the Node-B transmits the NACK<br>
message after receiving data from the UE, and waits for<br>
the UE to retransmit the data. However, if the NACK-to-<br>
ACK error occurs, the UE does not wait for the<br>
retransmission any longer, and deletes all of data stored<br>
in the buffer.<br>
According to the HARQ scheme based on the ACK/NACK<br>
signal, although the Node-B waits for retransmitted data<br>
from the UE, the UE does not transmit data any longer, so<br>
 <br>
that a time-frequency area is wasted by a predetermined<br>
amount corresponding to the maximum number of ReTx times.<br>
The Node-B detects energy using the HARQ scheme,<br>
and determines the presence or absence of any error in<br>
the ACK/NACK signal using the HARQ scheme. Specifically,<br>
the Node-B can determine whether the NACK-to-ACK error<br>
occurs. Namely, the Node-B determines that the<br>
transmission end (e.g., DE) has not transmitted data to<br>
the Node-B on the basis of the detected energy, or<br>
determines whether an error has occurred although data<br>
has been normally transmitted to the Node-B on the basis<br>
of the detected energy.<br>
FIG. 13 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary method for applying an embodiment of the<br>
present invention in consideration of the ACK/NACK error.<br>
If the Node-B detects the NACK-to-ACK error, the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 13 provides a new scheduling method<br>
for transmitting the DE's new data or new UE's data.<br>
If the Node-B determines the occurrence of the<br>
NACK-to-ACK error by detecting the energy, this situation<br>
may occur because the DE may not transmit actual data to<br>
the Node-B, or may also occur because the DE is in the<br>
deep fading status.<br>
 <br>
If it is determined that the UE was in the deep<br>
fading status, the Node-B may prefer to schedule other<br>
frequency bands, instead of requesting the retransmission<br>
from the UE. Therefore, if the NACK-to-ACK error occurs,<br>
the Node-B terminates the prior data retransmission<br>
process without requesting the retransmission from the UE,<br>
and then performs new scheduling of the next UE where<br>
data will be transmitted. In this case, retransmission of<br>
the prior data can be operated by an upper layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, a first UE (UE1) receives the<br>
grant message from the Node-B, and transmits uplink data<br>
to the Node-B, In order to command the UE1 to retransmit<br>
the data, the Node-B transmits the NACK signal to the UE1.<br>
However, the UE1 mistakes the NACK signal for the<br>
ACK signal although the Node-B has transmitted the NACK<br>
signal. Thus, the UEl does not retransmit the data, and<br>
the Node-B detects that a reception (Rx) signal has a<br>
weak strength at a specific time at which retransmission<br>
data will be received, so that the Node-B detects the<br>
occurrence of the NACK-to-ACK error.<br>
Although there is no NACK-to-ACK error (i.e., the<br>
UEl has retransmitted data), the Node-B may mistake the<br>
normal operation for the NACK-to-ACK error. In more<br>
detail, because the UEl is in the deep fading status, the<br>
 <br>
Node-B may not receive UEl's retransmission data or may<br>
not decode the UEl's retransmission data.<br>
If the NACK-to-ACK error is detected by the Node-B,<br>
the retransmission resources pre-scheduled by the<br>
synchronous HARQ scheme are used as the UE's new data or<br>
scheduling resources of other UEs.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 13, the Node-B newly<br>
allocates resources reserved for the UEl's retransmission<br>
to implement data transmission of a second UE (UE2).<br>
If the grant message indicating the aforementioned<br>
resources is transmitted to the UE2, the UE2 receives the<br>
grant message and transmits uplink data.<br>
Although the Node-B can detect the presence or<br>
absence of the NACK-to-ACK error using the above-<br>
mentioned method, it cannot prevent the resources from<br>
being wasted using only the conventional ACK/NACK<br>
operation scheme. As soon as the UE receives the ACK<br>
signal, the UE makes its own retransmission buffer empty,<br>
so that the UE has no more data to be retransmitted<br>
although the Node-B retransmits the NACK signal in order<br>
to request retransmission from the UE.<br>
FIG. 14 is a conceptual diagram illustrating<br>
another exemplary method for applying an embodiment of<br>
 <br>
the present invention in consideration of the ACK/NACK<br>
error.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 14 provides a method for<br>
maintaining Tx data of a transmission end in the buffer<br>
during a predetermined time, without deleting the Tx data<br>
from the buffer, although the transmission end does not<br>
retransmit data upon receiving the ACK signal from the<br>
reception end.<br>
The above-mentioned embodiment of FIG. 14 is<br>
similar to functions of the stop message. Namely, this<br>
embodiment may be similar to the other embodiment for<br>
transmitting the ACK signal used as the stop message. The<br>
UE receiving the ACK signal does not retransmit data as<br>
if the DE has received the stop message, however, and the<br>
previously-transmitted data stored in the buffer is<br>
maintained for a predetermined time.<br>
For example, according to the uplink transmission,<br>
when receiving the ACK signal from the Node-B, the UE<br>
stores retransmission data of in the buffer during a<br>
predetermined time without any change, instead of<br>
deleting all of data stored in the buffer. Then, if the<br>
UE receives again the NACK signal from the Node-B, it<br>
immediately retransmits the data stored in the buffer to<br>
the Node-B, so that resources are not unnecessarily<br>
 <br>
consumed. In this case, the predetermined time for<br>
storing the data may be equal to a time reaching the next<br>
retransmission at least.<br>
FIG. 15 is a conceptual diagram illustrating still<br>
another exemplary method for applying an embodiment of<br>
the present invention in consideration of the ACK/NACK<br>
error.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 15 provides a method for<br>
maintaining Tx data of the transmission end in the buffer<br>
without deleting the Tx data from the buffer, although<br>
the transmission end does not retransmit data upon<br>
receiving the ACK signal from the reception end. But, if<br>
the ACK/NACK error occurs in the reception end, the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 15 provides a method for transmitting<br>
the scheduling message.<br>
According to the embodiment of FIG. 15, although<br>
the transmission end receives the ACK signal, it<br>
continuously stores data in the buffer until receiving a<br>
scheduling message for indicating the new data<br>
transmission or the retransmission.<br>
The transmission end continuously stores data in<br>
the buffer until receiving the scheduling message from<br>
the reception end. And, as soon as the' transmission end<br>
receives the scheduling message indicating the new data<br>
 <br>
transmission from the reception end, it deletes all of<br>
data stored in the buffer.<br>
In the uplink transmission, the NACK-to-ACK error<br>
occurs, the Node-B confirms the presence of the NACK-to-<br>
ACK error by detecting energy, and performs new<br>
scheduling as shown in FIG. 13. In this case, under the<br>
condition that previous or old data has not been<br>
successfully received, the Node-B transmits data to<br>
another IE or transmits another data, resulting in an<br>
increased FER. Thus, this embodiment of FIG. 15 transmits<br>
a scheduling message after detecting the NACK-to-ACK<br>
error, so that the Node-B can transmit ReTx data to the<br>
erroneous UE using different frequency areas.<br>
This embodiment of FIG. 15 may also be used as a<br>
method for allowing the UE to determine the presence or<br>
absence of the ACK/NACK error. The UE transmits data,<br>
receives the ACK/NACK signal of the data, and determines<br>
the presence or absence of the ACK/NACK error by<br>
referring to the scheduling message received after the<br>
ACK/NACK signal.<br>
The UE is able to determine whether the<br>
retransmission is operated at the reception time of the<br>
ACK/NACK signal. However, the UE does not finally<br>
determine the success or failure of data transmission<br>
 <br>
message, so that only the locations of used resource<br>
blocks (RBs) are changed to other locations, but the MCS<br>
level or other components may be equal to those of the<br>
initial transmission. Otherwise, all of the RB location,<br>
the number of used RBs, and the MCS level may also be<br>
changed to others. In this case, the MCS level may be<br>
pre-defined between the Node-B and the UE on the basis of<br>
the payload size of Tx data and the number of used RBs.<br>
A method for determining which one of the new data<br>
transmission and the retransmission is indicated by the<br>
grant message shown in FIG. 15 may be equal or similar to<br>
those of the methods of FIGS. 5~7.<br>
In this case, the grant message includes the<br>
ACK/NACK information, so that there is no need to<br>
additionally the ACK/NACK information. In more detail, a<br>
reception end of data (e.g., Node-B) may simultaneously<br>
transmit the ACK/NACK signal and the grant message.<br>
However, if the Node-B transmits the grant message, there<br>
is no need to transmit the ACK/NACK signal. If the UE<br>
receives the grant message indicating the retransmission<br>
from the Node-B, it disregards the received ACK/NACK<br>
signal, and performs the retransmission via the resource<br>
area requested by the Node-B.<br>
FIG. 16 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
 <br>
method for controlling retransmission via the ACK/NACK<br>
message according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 15 provides a method for<br>
continuously storing Tx data in a buffer for a<br>
predetermined time although the UE receives the ACK<br>
signal, so that the Node-B can more effectively schedule<br>
resources. After the UE receives the ACK signal, it<br>
continuously stores Tx data in the buffer for the<br>
predetermined time.<br>
Thus, although the Node-B has not successfully<br>
received the data from the UE, it compulsorily transmits<br>
the ACK signal so that a retransmission operation of a<br>
specific UE can be temporarily interrupted. If there is<br>
no uplink resource to be allocated to a corresponding<br>
retransmission UE at the retransmission timing, the<br>
scheduling can be more flexibly operated.<br>
The UE receiving the ACK signal does not retransmit<br>
data at a corresponding time, but it does not delete the<br>
data from the buffer until receiving the grant message.<br>
As a result, the Node-B transmits the grant message<br>
indicating the retransmission to the UE at a desired time,<br>
so that it restarts retransmission of a corresponding<br>
process by transmitting the grant message indicating the<br>
 <br>
retransmission at a desired time.<br>
The above-mentioned retransmission interruption may<br>
also be operated by the other grant message indicating<br>
the retransmission. For example, the RB size of the grant<br>
message indicating the retransmission is set to Ss0", so<br>
that uplink retransmission of the corresponding terminal<br>
can be temporarily interrupted. In this case, the Node-B<br>
restarts retransmission of a corresponding process by<br>
transmitting the grant message indicating the<br>
retransmission at a desired time.<br>
The present invention can be applied to an uplink<br>
of the lx EV-DO synchronous system, and can also be<br>
applied to an uplink of the 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution<br>
due to less overhead.<br>
The above-mentioned embodiments of the present<br>
invention can be implemented by hardware, firmware,<br>
software, or a combination of them.<br>
