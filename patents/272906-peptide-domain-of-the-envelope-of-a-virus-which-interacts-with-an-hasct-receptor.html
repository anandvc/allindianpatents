Peptide domain required for interaction between the<br>
envelope of a virus pertaining to the HERV-W<br>
interference group and an hASCT receptor<br>
The present invention relates to a polypeptide domain responsible for interactions between a retroviral envelope of the HERV-W interference group and the receptors of the hASCT family.<br>
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) constitute 8% of the human genome and are involved both in pathologies and in nonpathological phenomena.<br>
The human endogenous retrovirus family W (HERV-W) is derived from an infectious retroviral element that was integrated into the germ line 25 to 40 million years ago. the_HERV-W envelope protein, also called syncytin, is a fusogenic glycoprotein involved in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblastic layer of the placenta. It is encoded by the env gene of the proviral locus ERVWl and synthesized in the form of a gPr7 3 precursor which is specifically cleaved into two mature proteins, a surface subunit gp50 (SU) and a transmembrane subunit gp24 (TM).<br>
.In vitro, syncytin of the HERV-W- family induces a cell to cell fusion that is dependent on its interaction with a receptor-transporter of amino acids of the ASCT family (h-ASCT2, hASCTl). Phylogenic studies then showed that syncytin is related to a group of retroviruses comprising in particular the cat endogenous virus RD114, the monkey endogenous virus BaEV, simian retroviruses and avian retroviruses: avian reticuloendotheliosis virus REV-A and spleen necrosis virus SNV, all having in common the type 2 sodium-dependant neutral amino acid receptor-transporter or<br>

ASC12 (rasko ex. al, 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 96, pp. 2129-2134; Tailor et al, 1999 Journal of Virology, vol. 73(5) May 1999, P. 4470-4474). Thus, the infection of cells with viruses of this retrovirus group leads to a specific reduction in the transport of amino acids (Rasko et al., 1999). The infection of a cell with one of these retroviruses (or the expression of one of these envelopes in the cell) prevents, through interference (interaction) in relation to a receptor of the ASCT family, the infection of this same cell by another of these retroviruses or the fusion with another cell expressing another envelope. Through interference in relation to a receptor of the ASCT family, the infection of a cell by one of these retroÂ¬viruses prevents the infection by another of these retroviruses. All these retroviruses belong to the same HERV-W virus interference group.<br>
The mechanisms of binding between the envelope and the ASCT receptor remain obscure, and to date no domain for binding to an ASCT receptor has been identified and defined either in the SU of the HERV-W envelope protein or in the SUs of retroviruses of the same interference group. This theme is nevertheless essential since the inhibition of the envelope/ASCT receptor interaction would in addition make it possible to prevent the entry of a retrovirus into the cell, and therefore to block its replication cycle, to block the phenomenon of envelope/ASCT receptor interaction and/or of cell fusion which may be involved in the formation of tumors, in the proliferation of metastasic cells or in drug resistance phenomena (see by way of illustration the publication "Cell fusion: A hidden enemy?. Cancer Cell: May 2003, vol. 3), to block the phenomenon of envelope/ASCT receptor interaction and/or of cell fusion which may be involved in nervous system diseases and even to inhibit the cell-cell fusion involved in trophoblastic      differentiation       (contraceptive<br>
 <br>
vaccination). Furthermore, the inhibition of the envelope/hASCT receptor interaction could prevent tumor propagation by counteracting a local immunosuppression which may result from the envelope/hASCT receptor interaction. Indeed, it has been shown, on the one hand, that the infection of cells with viruses of this retrovirus group (in particular those inducing immunodeficiencies) leads to a specific reduction in the transport of amino acids (Rasko et al, PNAS, vol. 96. pp 2129-2134 (1999)), and on the other hand, a direct link is proposed between the impairment of the transport of amino acids and immunosuppression (Espinosa A, Villarreal LP., T-Ag inhibits implantation by EC cell derived embryoid bodies. Virus Genes. 2000; 20(3): 195-200; JE, Battini JL, Gottschalk RJ, Mazo I, Miller AD., The RD114/simian type D retrovirus receptor is a neutral amino acid transporter. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1999, Mar 2; 96(5): 2129-34). Thus, as regards nervous system diseases, it is known that the hASCT receptors are involved in the specific transport of neutral amino acids and that neuronal cells, for the transmission of information, predominantly use neuromediators of a polypeptide nature. Thus, the binding of the Env-HERV-W protein to receptors which normally have to transport the amino acids required for the synthesis of neuromediators can affect the capacity of the neurons to synthesize the neuromediators by reducing the entry of the physiological agonists such as amino acids via the ASCT receptors. Moreover, if neurons whose intercellular networks form connections which are essential for the transmission of information circulating in the brain and the spinal cord, form syncytia following a fusion of several neurons which is induced by the Env-HERV-W protein, all the networks for transmission of information become disrupted and connected to the same fused "cellular package" and, furthermore, the neuromediator production activity of each cell is no longer individualized or connected to<br>

The monoclonal antibodies may be prepared according to conventional techniques known to a person skilled in the art such as the hybridoma technique whose general principle is recalled below.<br>
In a first instance, an animal, generally a mouse (or cultured cells in the context of in vitro immunizations) , is immunized with a target antigen of interest, whose B lymphocytes are then capable of producing antibodies against said antigen. These antibody-producing lymphocytes are then fused with "immortal" myelomatous cells (murine in the example) in order to give rise to hybridomas. From the heterogenous mixture of cells thus obtained, a selection of the cells capable of producing a particular antibody and of multiplying it indefinitely is then carried out. Each hybridoma is multiplied in clone form, each leading to the production of a monoclonal antibody whose recognition properties in relation to the antigen of interest may be tested, for example by ELISA, by one-or two-dimensional immunotransfer, by immunoÂ¬fluorescence or with the aid of a biosensor. The monoclonal antibodies thus selected are subsequently purified in particular according to the affinity chromatography technique.<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
The expression antibody fragment is understood to mean any antibody fragment following an immune response against a virus belonging to the HERV-W interference group. These antibody fragments may, for example, be obtained by proteolysis. Thus, they may be obtained by enzymatic digestion, resulting in fragments of the Fab type (treatment with papain; Porter RR, 1959, Biochem. J., 73: 199-125) or of the F(ab)'2 type (treatment with pepsin; Nisonoff A. et al., 1960, Science, 132: 1770-1771) . They may also be prepared by the recombinant route (Skerra A., 1993, Curr. Opin. Immunol., 5: 256-262). Another antibody fragment which is suitable for the proposals of the invention comprises an Fv fragment which is a dimer consisting of the noncovalent combination of the variable light (VL) domain and of the variable heavy (VH) domain of the Fab fragment, and therefore the combination of two polypeptide chains. In order to improve the stability of the Fv fragment due to the dissociation of the two polypeptide chains, this Fv fragment may be modified by genetic engineering by inserting a suitable linker peptide between the VL domain and the VH domain (Huston P. et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85: 5879-5883). The expression scFv fragment ("single chain Fragment variable") is then used because it consists of a single polypeptide chain. The use of a linker peptide preferably composed of 15 to 25 amino acids makes it possible to link the C-terminus of one domain to the N-terminus of the other domain, thus constituting a monomeric molecule endowed with binding properties similar to those of the antibody in its complete form. Both orientations of the VL and VH domains are suitable (VL-linker-VH and VH-linker-VL) because they exhibit identical functional properties. Of course, any fragment known to a person skilled in the art and exhibiting the immunological characteristics defined above are suitable for the purposes of the invention.<br>

The invention also relates to the use of at least one peptide domain according to the invention, of at least one epitope according to the invention, of at least one antibody according to the invention or of at least one nucleotide sequence according to the invention, for the preparation of a medicament intended for the inhibition, prevention or treatment of an infection caused by a virus belonging to the HERV-W interference group in an animal, preferably humans. The peptide domain according to the invention may be used in particular for targeting cells expressing a receptor of the hASCT family in order to transduce a signal, and modulate the flow of amino acids (cancer treatments) .<br>
The expression elements necessary for a constitutive expression of peptides is understood to mean a ubiquitous promoter specific to eukaryotic cells. By way of elements necessary for an inducible expression of the peptides, there may be mentioned the elements for regulating the E. coli operon for resistance to tetracycline (Gossen M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 5547-5551 (1992)).<br>
The use of at least one peptide domain according to the invention, of at least one epitope according to the invention, or of at least one nucleotide sequence according to the invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of a medicament intended for the prevention of an infection caused by a virus belonging<br>
I to the HERV-W interference group in an animal, preferably humans. The use of at least one antibody according to the invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of a medicament intended for the inhibition or treatment of an infection or a pathology<br>

The detection/quantification step may be carried out by any detection means known in the field of immunological assays of very small molecules, such as direct detection, that is to say without the intermediary of a binding partner or of binding partners, and indirect detection, that is to say through the intermediary of a binding partner or of binding partners.<br>

the art and are described in particular .in Principles and Practice of Immunoessay, 2nd edition, Edited by C. Price, D.G. Newman, Stockton Press, 1997, 345 Park Avenue South, New York.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the above<br>
composition for the in vitro screening of a virus<br>
belonging to the HERV-W interference group in a<br>
biological sample or specimen. In particular, the early<br>
screening of a virus such as SRVl and SRV2, viruses<br>
that are involved in immunodeficiency mechanisms in<br>
monkeys, makes it possible to provide a treatment<br>
	suitable for the host before the appearance of an<br>

The invention also relates to the use of a peptide domain according to the invention or of an epitope according to the invention, or of an antibody according to the invention, for inhibiting the interaction between the envelope of a virus belonging to the HERV-W<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 2 6)<br>
 <br>
interference group and an ASCT receptor. This makes it possible, in particular, to obtain a contraceptive immunotherapy.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a peptide domain according to the invention for identifying chemical or biological molecules whose interaction with all or part of this peptide domain blocks the interaction between the envelope of a virus belonging to the HERV-W interference group and an ASCT receptor. For example, when a peptide domain according to the invention of HERV-W is used, this makes it possible to obtain in particular chemical or biological molecules that are highly suitable in order to obtain a contraceptive treatment. The use of such chemical moleÂ¬cules to inhibit the interaction between the envelope of a virus belonging to the HERV-W interference group and an ASCT receptor is of therapeutic interest.<br>
As a guide, two generic methods allowing the screening of chemical or biological molecules capable of inhibiting the env/receptor interaction are described below.<br>
In a context where it is possible to produce a soluble envelope, it is advisable to determine if a chemical or biological molecule alters the env/receptor interaction according to an ELISA type method using cells expressing at least one hASCT receptor in a capture phase. Thus, on a 96-well plate, cells expressing an hASCT receptor of interest are cultured or adsorbed, and an env/receptor interaction is detected via the use of a labeled soluble envelope (histine tag, GPF fusion), and therefore capable of generating a reference signal that can be assayed. If a signal reduction is observed after preincubation of said soluble envelope with a chemical or biological molecule, that means that the chemical or biological<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
molecule alters the env/receptor interaction. AlterÂ¬natively, it is possible to use a retroviral vector pseudotyped by the envelope of interest and expressing a detectable marker (LacZ) and to carry out the same test. It is also possible to select molecules of interest via a measurement of fusion inhibition. Cells expressing the receptor of interest (cell-recept), for example HeLa or XC-RDR cells, and cells constitutively expressing a marker (for example, LacZ) and transiently or stably expressing the envelope of interest (cell-env-LacZ) are used; the envelope of interest was modified beforehand at the level of its intra-cytoplasmic tail by exchange with the intracytoplasmic domain of HERV-W env so as to make it constitutively fusogenic (Cheynet et al, 79(9): 5586-5593, 2005). The bringing into contact of the two cell types, "cell-recept" in excess and "cell-env-LacZ" in insufficient amount, leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells or syncytia, containing one or two blue nuclei derived from "cell-env-LacZ" and tens of white nuclei derived from "cell-recept". An identical co-culture performed in the presence of a chemical or biological molecule altering the env/receptor interaction leads to a reduction in the number of syncytia and their nucleus content. Automation of such measurements with the aid of a CCD camera is possible.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a peptide domain in accordance with the invention for generating antibodies blocking . the interaction between the envelope of a virus belonging to the HERV-W interference group and an hASCT receptor.<br>

Example 1: Molecular and phenotypical characterization of recombinant envelopes<br>
Construction and production of the HERV-W envelope SU subunit<br>
A vector phCMVEnv-Gp60 allowing the expression of a soluble recombinant envelope protein was designed from the expression vector phCMV-Env-W (Blond J Virol, Vol 74(7): 3321-3329, 2000) containing the HERV-W envelope gene (538 amino acids) (clone PH74, Blond et al. J Virol Vol 73(2): 1175-1185, 1999).<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
The soluble envelope (Gp60,1-435) was constructed as described below:<br>
(1)	The native cleavage site RNKR (AA 314 to 317)<br>
between the SU and TM subunits was mutated to AAAR in<br>
order to allow the production of a fusion protein that<br>
was stable and not of two SU-TM subunits cleaved and<br>
then recombined by a disulfide bridge.<br>
(2)	The transmembrane  (tm)  and intracytoplasmic<br>
(CYT) regions corresponding to amino acids 436 to 538<br>
were deleted in order to obtain a soluble protein.<br>
(3)	A spacer arm having the composition (GGGS)3,<br>
followed by a polyhistidine tail (RGS-HHHHHH), were<br>
added at the C-terminal position in order to allow the<br>
purification of this protein by IMAC and the detection<br>
by an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Qiagen,<br>
RGS H6) .<br>
Starting with the vector phCMVEnv-Gp60 expressing the soluble envelope, the vector phCMV-EnvSU was constructed, allowing the production of an SU protein. The soluble SU is a fusion protein containing a C-terminal polyhistidine tail having the sequence RGS-HHHHHH immediately downstream of the sequence AAAR, in order to allow the purification of this protein by IMAC and the detection by an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Qiagen, RGS H6) .<br>
The schematic structure of the various proteins produced from the vectors phCMV-Env-W, phCMV-EnvGp60 and phCMV-EnvSU is illustrated in figure la.<br>
Production of the soluble envelope<br>
The expression plasmid phCMV-EnvGp60 or phCMV-EnvSU is transfected into the HEK293T cells by precipitation with calcium phosphate. The supernatant containing the GP60 or SU envelope is collected after 48 hours of<br>
REPLACE^	 	      ""<br>
 <br>
production in a serum-free medium and filtered on 0.45 Âµm membranes in order to remove the cellular debris. 20 Âµ1 of supernatant are directly analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel and by Western blotting with an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Quiagen, RGS H6) . The GP60 and SU proteins are correctly expressed in soluble form.<br>
Binding test and analysis by flow cytometry<br>
The stable lines XChASCT2 and XChASCTl constitutively expressing the hASCT2 (XChASCT2) or hASCTl (XChASCTl) receptors were established after transfection of XC cells (rat sarcoma) with vectors expressing either human receptor hASCT followed by selection of a clone as described above (Frendo et al. , Mol. Cell Biol,, Vol 23(10): 3566-3574, 2003). The following human cells are described in Blond J Virol, Vol 74(7): 3321-3329, 2000. The TE671 cells express hASCT2. The TE671RD cells constitutively express the RD114 envelope (cat endogenous retrovirus) belonging to the same interference group and therefore recognizing the hASCT2 receptor. TE671galv cells constitutively express the GALV (gibbon ape leukemia virus) envelope belonging to another interference group and recognizing the PiT1 receptor.<br>
The cells were washed in PBS and harvested by detaching with 0.02% versene in PBS. A total of 10 cells were incubated with 1 ml of filtered supernatant containing the soluble envelope (Gp60 or SU) for 1 hour at 37Â°C. The cells were washed with PBA (PBS and 0.5% sodium azide) containing 2% fetal calf serum and were labeled for 1 hour at 4Â°C with an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (RGSH6, Quiagen). The cells were washed once with PBA and incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to fluorescein isocyanate for 1 hour at 4Â°C. The cells were washed twice with PBA and analyzed by<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 2 6)<br>
 <br>
flow cytometry.<br>
Using the target cells XChASCT2, the inventors demonstrated that the recombinant protein Gp60 corresponding to a soluble form of the envelope has a phenotypical characteristic identical to that of the wild-type envelope, namely that it is capable of binding to XC cells expressing the hASCT2 receptor.<br>
Using the target cells XChASCT2, XChASCTl, TE671, TE671RD, TE671 galv, the inventors demonstrated that the recombinant protein corresponding to the SU subunit of the envelope exhibits phenotypical characteristics identical to those of the wild-type envelope. First of all, the SU subunit is capable of binding to two receptors hASCTl and hASCT2 (figure lb). Furthermore, this protein was tested in relation to human cells TE671 and derived cells TE671RD and TE671galv. The soluble SU protein bound to the TE6781 cells expressing the hASCT2 receptor and the TE671galv cells blocked for the PiTl receptor, but did not bind to the TE671RD cells blocked for the hASCT2 receptor (figure Ic) . The SU recombinant protein and the envelope of the RD114 retrovirus specifically interfered.<br>
Example 2: Identification of the domains for interaction of the SU part of the W envelope with its hASCT2 receptor<br>
In order to identify the boundaries of the region of the envelope binding to the hASCT2 receptor, the inventors constructed a set of deletion mutants from the N- and C-terminal ends. The domains of the SU subunit were obtained by PCR and subcloned into the expression vector pHCMV-EnvSU and sequenced. The expression plasmids phCMV-EnvSU, Env69-317, Envl97, Envl68, Envl69-317, Envll7 and Envl44 (figure 2a) were transfected into the HEK293T cells by precipitation<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
with calcium phosphate. The conditions for production and analysis of the proteins are identical to those detailed in example 1.<br>
EnvSU,  Env69-317 and Envl97 proteins were correctly<br>
expressed  in  soluble  form.  Using  the  XC  cells<br>
constitutively   expressing   hASCT2,   the   inventors<br>
emonstrated that the Envl97 protein was capable of<br>
ending to the receptor expressed at the surface of the<br>
clls like the SU subunit (1-317). Thus, the first 176<br>
esidues  of  the  mature  SU  subunit  (and  therefore<br>
acking its signal peptide) were sufficient for binding<br>
a the surface of the cells expressing the hASCT2<br>
eceptor. The deletion of the 21-68 region resulted in<br>
loss of binding to the receptor also indicating its<br>
evolvement in the receptor binding domain (RBD) . On<br>
he   other hand, the truncated Envl68 protein showed a<br>
power capacity for binding to the hASCT2 receptor.<br>
 order to obtain the equivalent quantities in the upernatants between the various truncated proteins, the inventors fused two smaller domains of the -terminal region of SU (Envll7 and Envl44) to the -terminal region of the SU subunit (Envl69-317), the atter domain not binding to hASCT2. The level of kpression of the Envll7 and Envl44 proteins was Lmilar and the proteins were expressed in soluble form. The binding test showed that only the Envl44 rotein was capable of binding to the cells expressing he hASCT2 receptor. The absence of binding of the nvll7 protein to the surface of the cells indicated he loss of at least one determinant of binding inside the 117-144 region.<br>
pnsequently, the boundaries of the domains for proteraction of the W envelope with its receptor are efined by amino acids 21 to 144.<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
It should be noted that, in general, proteins (including the envelope proteins) intended for secretion or for membrane expression are synthesized in the granular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) . The translocation of the neosynthesized proteins in the ER is conditioned by an N-terminal signal peptide (Walter and Lingappa 1986). The hydrophobic region of the signal peptide initiates penetration into the membrane of the reticulum, bringing behind it the remainder of the neosynthesized peptide. Since the translocation starts at the same time as the synthesis, it is the peptide being translated which crosses the ER membrane. While the protein passes into the lumene of the ER, the signal sequence is cleaved by a specific cellular enzyme, signal peptidase (Walter P, Johnson AE: Signal sequence recognition and protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994, 10: 87-119). The translocation of Env into the ER is stopped by the (hydrophobic) transmembrane domain of the glycoprotein which becomes anchored at the phospholipid membranes. In the ER lumene, the regions (SU and part of TM) intended to become extracytoplasmic are folded (the disulfide bridges formed), glycosylated and oligomerized. After oligomerization, the proteins undergoing maturation are transported into the Golgi apparatus where they undergo new glycan maturation processes and cleavage by furin-type endoproteases recognizing a motif R/KXXR leading to two SU and TM subunits.<br>
The mature protein is targeted to the plasma membrane by virtue of a motif present on the intracytoplasmic tail containing a tyrosine (aliphatic/aromatic(Y-X-X)).<br>

REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 2 6)<br>
 <br>
A peptide (112-129, TGMSDGGGVQDQAREKHV+C, 19 amino acids) was defined from the region defined in example 2 and from a determination of the potentially antigenic regions of the SU subunit. A cysteine was added at the C-terminal position for the KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, cf. Frendo et al., Mol. Cell Biol. Vol 23(10): 3566-3574, 2003) coupling. This peptide was used to immunize a rabbit and then to affinity purify the polyclonal antibody directed against the region 112-119 contained in the serum of this rabbit.<br>
The Envl44 protein is preincubated at 37Â°C for one hour with either the anti-SU polyclonal antibody or with an anti-TM polyclonal antibody. The formation of the Envl44 protein-anti-SU antibody complex drastically reduced the binding of the envelope to the cells expressing the hASCT2 receptor. By contrast, the use of an antibody not directed against the RBD did not adversely affect its binding to the hASCT2 receptor.<br>
Example 4: Production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the HERV-W envelope protein<br>
Immunization of mice with DNA<br>
Three female six-week-old BALB/c mice (IFFA-Credo) were immunized by direct injection of naked plasmid DNA (phCMV-env-W) containing the gene for the HERV-W envelope.  The  injections  were  performed  by  the<br>
 intradermal route with the aid of a gene gun. Five injections of 2 Âµg of DNA were first performed for each mouse followed by a booster with two injections of 4 Âµg of DNA. The sera were collected and the antibody titer for each serum was determined. Since the antibody titer<br>
  was too low, a cellular lysate was prepared.<br>

The rhabdomyosarcoma cells TelCeB6 (ATCC CRL8805) were transfected with the plasmid phCMV-env-W. After about 20 hours and the presence of syncytia, a cellular extract was prepared in PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton. The protein extracts were assayed by Bradford. The env-W antigen concentration corresponded to 9.5 pg/yl of total proteins.<br>
Immunization of mice with an extract of cellular lysate<br>
The same mice first of all received an injection of 10 ]jg of cellular lysate by the intraperitoneal route followed by a booster injection of 2 x 100 Âµg of cellular lysate by the intraperitoneal route. Three days before the fusion with myeloma cells, another injection was performed,-by the intravenous route, with 22 Âµg of soluble envelope protein Gp60 obtained from the plasmid phCMV-Env-Gp60 as described in example 1, purified beforehand, before injection, on to an Ni-NTA resin (Quiagen) according to the following conditions: binding in phosphate buffer pH 8, washes in phosphate buffer pH 8 and in ammonium acetate pH 6, elution in ammonium acetate buffer pH 3.5 and concentration with speed vac. 47 jjg of the eukaryotic Gp60 protein thus obtained were reserved for the injection by the intravenous route described above. After fusion, the hybridoma supernatants were tested by immunoÂ¬fluorescence on the transfected and bound cells (TeLCeb6), the antibodies were screened by a functional ELISA test using the Env-W protein at a concentration of 9.2 Âµg/Âµl of total proteins and an Env AS protein as negative control at a concentration of 13.3 Âµg/Âµl of total proteins and the most effective antibodies were selected.<br>

The monoclonal antibody IF11B10 is directed against the glycosylated C-terminal part of the SU region of the Env-HERV-W protein as shown by a Western blot assay with the aid of Env 169-317. It does not recognize Env 144.<br>
Example 5: Test of in vitro inhibition of the binding of the envelope to its receptor and inhibition of the formation of syncytia with the aid of monoclonal antibodies by a cell to cell fusion test (coculture)<br>
The plasmid for expressing the envelope glycoprotein is transfected into the cells TELCeB6 by precipitation with calcium phosphate at two quantities 100 and 500 ng (Cosset-et al., Journal of Virology, 69 (10): 6314-6322 (1995)). The cells expressing the envelope are detached from the support 20 hours after transfection and are preincubated at 37 Â°C for one hour, respectively, with the anti-HIV 23A5 monoclonal antibody, the anti-TM Env-HERV-W 6A2B2 monoclonal antibody (previously obtained), the anti-SU Env-HERV-W 2H1H8 12C7A3 and IF11B10 monoclonal antibodies (dilution l/50th). Next, they are reinoculated at equal concentration (0.4 x 105 cells/well) into 12-well plates. Epithelioid-carcinoma-indicating human cells (Hela, ATCC CCL-2) are then added to the transfected cells in an amount of 2 X 10^ cells per well and the co-culture is continued for 24 h. An XGal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-p-D-galactopyranoside) staining may then be performed in order to stain the nucleus of the cells TELCeB6 (Cosset et al., Journal of Virology, 69 (10): 6314-6322 (1995) ) . It is followed by staining with May-Griinwald and Giemsa solutions (MERCK) performed according to the suppliers' recommendations. The fusion observed corresponds to a fusion "from within", that is to say a<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
cell to cell fusion, starting with a cell expressing the envelope, in contrast to a fusion "from without" which corresponds to a formation of syncytia following a virion-cell (s) fusion.<br>
The results presented in table 1 below express the number of fused cells counted.<br>
 <br>
The results presented above show that the formation of the Env protein-anti-SU 2H1H8 and 12C7A3 antibody complex dramatically reduces the binding of the envelope to cells expressing the hASCT2 receptor and cell fusion. By contrast, the use of an antibody not directed against rdb (6A2B2 or IFIIB10) does not adversely affect the binding of the envelope and the fusion of the cells significantly, as may be observed by comparing to the results obtained with the anti-HIV 23A5 control antibody.<br>
Example 6: Study of the in vivo interaction between the envelope protein and the hASCT2 receptor and the in vivo  formation of syncytia<br>
To verify the results obtained in vitro, an animal model was designed. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells TelCeB6 (ATCC CRL8 805), in culture in DMEM medium (Gibco Invitrogen 41966-029) supplemented with South American serum, were respectively transfected, with the aid of the LipofectAMINE PLUSâ¢ kit (Gibco Invitrogen), with the DNA corresponding to the HERV-W env gene cloned in the sense orientation at the concentration of 2 Âµg/Âµl<br>

(DNA 409), with the DNA corresponding to the HERV-W env gene cloned in the anti-sense orientation at the concentration of 1.5 Âµg/Âµl (DNA 410) and with the DNA corresponding to a mutated HERV-W env gene at the concentration of 1.3 Âµg/Âµl (DNA LQMV) according to the protocol detailed below. The cells transfected with the DNA 409 are capable of expressing the fusogenic W envelope protein, the cells transfected with the DNA 410 are not capable of expressing the envelope protein and the cells transfected with the DNA LQMV are capable of expressing a nonfusogenic mutated W envelope protein.<br>

REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
the 2 ml of peritoneal fluid (protocol developed for the recovery, in transplanted animals, of the cells implanted in the peritoneal cavity);<br>
observation under an "inverted phase" microscope with counting of the syncytia and/or after staining on a slide;<br>
immediate reading performed after spreading on slides with a gridded chamber in the presence of Trypan blue (exclusion of the dead cells) . The number of cells which have fused to each other was counted per field with a "wide angle" lens (40) which makes it possible ... to establish the count on more than about one hundred cells so as to have a series of statistically representative counts.<br>
A cellular aliquot of each sample is fixed in the presence of methanol/acetone (v/v) and then stored at -20Â°C until a crystal violet staining is obtained (1%). Photographs were taken of the stained slides.<br>
2)	Mice:<br>
Groups of 2 mice are inoculated with:<br>
the cells transfected with the three types of plasmid<br>
(DNAs 409, 410 and LQMV) with no antibody (3x2= 6 mice) the cells transfected with the three types of plasmid<br>
(DNAs 409, 410 and LQMV) with the monoclonal antibody 2H1H8 (3x2= 6 mice).<br>
3)	Results:<br>
The number of fused cells determined by direct reading on a gridded counting chamber per 100 cells is indicated in Table 2 below:<br>
Table 2<br>
ECP (Tryptan blue) reading: direct reading of the REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Each number represents the number of fused and visualized cells per field studied. As some cells may be superposed in the optical path, the count for the cells appearing fused in the controls is greater than zero. The reality of the syncytia and the discrimination with stacks of cells were then verified by staining the cells on a slide, with visualization of multiple cell nuclei contained in a space delimited by the continuation of a single and sole cell membrane. Moreover, photos showing cells in the course of fusion made it possible to objectify the reality of the fusion upon analysis by phase contrast microscopy and the total absence of an equivalent phenomenon in the controls.<br>
To statistically objectify the primary analysis represented by the numbers indicated in Table 2, a Chi-2 test was performed in order to compare the data in Table 2.<br>
The results of the statistical analysis taking into  account the "background noise" of the primary reading, without secondary analysis after staining on a slide or a search for typical cells in the course of fusion which are never seen in the controls, are the following: <br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
i) Statistical validation of the specificity of the<br>
pathogenic effect in  vivo:<br>
Env expressed (409): 20.5 positives counted on average<br>
out of 100 cells,<br>
anti-sense Env (410): 9.5 positives counted on average<br>
out of 100 cells,<br>
mutated Env (LQMV):  6.5 positives counted on average<br>
out of 100 cells,<br>
mean of the controls (410 and LQMV): 9.5 + 6.5/2 = 8%.<br>
Env versus control 410: Chi-2 = 5.89 (p 
Env versus control LQMV: Chi-2 =9.83 (p 
Env versus the two controls (410 and LQMV): Chi-2 = 7.69<br>
(p 
Control   410   versus   control.  LQMV:    Chi-2 =0.61<br>
(difference not significant).<br>
The controls are therefore statistically equivalent and there is no "real" difference linked to the type of control.<br>
The results obtained from this stage of analysis (not excluding the background noise linked to the artefactual images and by comparing the two types of control with each other (which prove to be equivalent)) was statistically very significant (overall p 
ii) Statistical validation of the therapeutic activity   of the  antibodies tested on the pathogenic effect in  vivo:<br>
Env expressed (409): 20.5 positives counted on average out of 100 cells,<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
Env expressed (409) + monoclonal antibody 2H1H8: 3.5 positives counted on average out of 100 cells.<br>
Env alone versus injection of the antibody 2H1H8: Chi-2 = 15.38 (p 
The results obtained show a statistically significant effect for the monoclonal antibody (probability of result due to chance (p) less than 0.001). Subsequent analyses, by staining, of the specificity of the effects merely confirm the specificity of the effect obtained in vivo in the presence of the Env protein and of antibody, thereby validating the therapeutic effect on the animal model.<br>

3	Inoculation<br>

3)	Mice:<br>
Groups of 2 mice are inoculated with:<br>
each type of cell (expressing the 2 types of receptor hASCTl and hASCT2 and one not expressing the receptor hASCT - as a control) with no antibody (3x2 = 6 mice) the three types of cell with the Env protein and the monoclonal antibody 2H1H8 (3x2 = 6 mice).<br>
4)	Results<br>
The results by immunofluorescence (IF) reading with a microscope are presented in Table 3 below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Each number represents the number of cells visualized as fluorescent per field studied. As some cells may have bound fluorescence in a non-specific manner, the count for the cells appearing fluorescent under the control conditions is therefore greater than zero in one of the two fields counted (mean of the two fields = 1/28, that is 0.036%, which is entirely reasonable for the background noise of such a reading technique). The reality of the cells that bound the Env protein to their hASCTl or hASCT2 receptor was then verified by cytofluorometric analysis.<br>
In order to statistically objectify the analysis presented in Table 3, a Chi-2 test was performed in order to compare the data obtained under the conditions according to which (i) the Env protein can bind to a receptor hASCTl (control hASCTl) or hASCT2 (control hASCT2) present at the surface of the cells transplanted into SCID mice versus the grafted control cells which have no receptor (control X) to which the Env protein injected into the corresponding animals cannot bind and thus does not give membrane fluorescence in the presence of an anti-Env antibody and (ii) the Env protein can bind to a receptor hASCTl (control hASCTl) or hASCT2 (control hASCT2) present at the surface of the cells transplanted into SCID mice versus the injection of a monoclonal antibody directed against Env-SU.<br>
The results of the statistical analysis are presented<br>
below:<br>
i) Statistical validation of the specificity of the<br>
pathogenic effect in  vivo:<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
control hASCTl: 24 positives counted on average out of<br>
77 cells,<br>
control hASCT2: 23 positives counted on average out of<br>
57 cells,<br>
hASCT- cells: 1 positive counted on average out of 28<br>
cells.<br>
Env+grafts hASCTl versus hASCT-: Chi-2 = 8.62 (p 
The cells expressing the hASCTl or hASCT2 receptors at their surface are therefore indeed statistically equivalent and there is no difference in the Env binding to the receptor linked to subtype 1 or 2, under the conditions of the experiment.<br>
The results obtained with the animals transplanted with the cells expressing the membrane receptors hASCTl or hASCT2 are statistically significant in the light of the results obtained with the control animals transÂ¬planted with the cells expressing none of these receptors at their surface.<br>
These results confirm the specificity of the effect obtained in vivo in the presence of the Env protein in the animal models.<br>
ii) Statistical validation of the therapeutic activity<br>
of the antibodies tested on the pathogenic effect<br>
in  vivo:<br>
Env+grafts  control  hASCTl:  24  positives  counted  on<br>
average out of 77 cells<br>
Env+grafts  hASCTl  +  monoclonal  antibody  2H1H8:  2<br>
positives counted on average out of 73 cells.<br>
Env+grafts  hASCTl  alone  versus  injection  antibody REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
 <br>
2H1H8: Chi-2 = 21.14 (p 
The results obtained show a statistically significant effect for the monoclonal antibody (probability of the result due to chance (p) less than 0.001).<br>
Env+grafts hASCT2: 23 positives counted on average out of 57 cells<br>
Env+grafts hASCT2 + monoclonal antibody 2H1H8: 1 positive counted on average out of 45 cells.<br>
Env+grafts hASCT2 alone versus injection antibody 2H1H8: Chi-2 = 20.31 (p 
The results obtained show a statistically significant effect for the monoclonal antibody (probability of the result due to chance (p) overall less than 0.01).<br>
The validation of the animal models against the appropriate controls makes it possible to demonstrate that antibodies may have a therapeutic activity by significantly inhibiting the pathogenic effects of the ~HERV-W Env protein.<br>
Example 8: Alignment of the sequences of the interference group<br>
The protein sequences of the envelopes of the retroviruses HERV-W (swiss-prot Q9UQF0), RD114 (swiss-prot Q98654), REV (swiss-prot P31796), BAEV (swiss-prot P10269), SRVl (swiss-prot P04027), SRV2 (swiss-prot P51515) and MPMV (swiss-prot P07575) were aligned with the aid of the MacVector software with the ClustalW procedure.
