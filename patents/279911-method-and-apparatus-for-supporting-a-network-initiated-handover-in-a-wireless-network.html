SUPPORTING A NETWORK INITIATED HANDOVER IN A WIRELESS<br>
NETWORK," filed March 14, 2008, which is commonly owned and<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
This application is related to a co-pending application, Serial No.<br>
«Appl_Number», entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING<br>
A CONTROLLED HANDOVER IN A WIRELESS NETWORK," filed<br>
«Appl_Date», which is assigned to the assignee of the present application.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication systems and,<br>
in particular, to supporting a network initiated handover in a wireless network.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Network initiated handovers may occur to balance network load across<br>
multiple base stations (BSs) in the network, to perform maintenance (e.g.,<br>
when a serving base station (SBS) needs to be removed from service for<br>
software or hardware upgrades), or for various other reasons. This is<br>
preferable from an operator and MS perspective for active calls. It is desirable<br>
for the selection of a target base station (TBS) for a mobile station (MS) to<br>
handover to to depend on how well the MS is receiving signaling from that and<br>
other prospective TBSs. However, often the network doesn't have the most<br>
reliable information regarding the best handover target BS for an MS at a<br>
given instance of time.<br>
A controlled handover in a WiMAX network refers to a handover where<br>
an MS hands off to a TBS which was previously notified and prepared by the<br>
serving BS (SBS) for an incoming handover by the MS. Controlled handovers<br>
in WiMAX and 802.16 based networks may be initiated by either the MS, SBS<br>
or Access Service Network (ASN) in response to deteriorating wireless<br>
conditions, network load balancing, network maintenance, etc. See e.g., IEEE<br>
802.16Rev2/D2 section 6.3.22.2.2 and WiMAX Networking Specification<br>
Stage-3 Text R1.0 (v1.2), Section 4.7.2.<br>
In a controlled handover, the network notifies prospective TBS<br>
candidates via handover preparation procedures so that they are prepared to<br>
receive a handover from the MS. Handover preparation of potential TBSs<br>
helps to reduce data loss during handover. It also enables the TBS to offer<br>
priority access to the MS when it contacts the TBS for handover, thereby<br>
reducing handover latency delays.<br>
Handover preparation includes passing network context information<br>
such as the anchor authenticator ID, the anchor data path ID, and the latest<br>
MAC context information from the SBS to the TBSs. Handover preparation<br>
may also include the establishment of bearer connections between the TBS<br>
and network in order to continue the mobile's IP session.<br>
In a network initiated controlled handover, the network proposes one or<br>
more candidate TBSs for an MS to handover to in the IEEE 802.16<br>
MOB_BSHO-REQ message. See e.g., P802.16Rev2/D2 section 6.3.22.2 and<br>
WiMAX R1.2 Networking Specification Stage-3 Text, Section 4.7.2.1.6. The<br>
MS responds by sending a MOB_HO-IND message indicating its acceptance<br>
or rejection of the handover target BS(s) proposed by the serving BS. If the<br>
MS accepts a TBS proposed by the serving BS, it moves to the selected<br>
target BS and begins ranging to complete the handover. If the MS rejects the<br>
target BS(s) offered by the serving BS, it sets the T42 timer and waits for the<br>
SBS to propose an alternate TBS for the MS to handover to. This process<br>
repeats until an acceptable TBS for handover is offered by the serving BS or<br>
the T42 timer expires. See P802.16Rev2/D2 Figure 150.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signaling flow diagram that depicts a first example of a<br>
network initiated handover, in accordance with the prior art. The signaling flow<br>
of diagram 400 depicts a network initiated handover procedure for an 802.16<br>
compliant MS similar to that described in NWG R1.0 v1.2 stage-3 section<br>
4.7.2 and 4.7.2.1.6.<br>
In diagram 400 the SBS notifies and prepares three candidate TBSs for<br>
the MS to handover to before requesting the MS to handover to one of them.<br>
The MS selects one of the candidate TBSs (candidate TBS-1) offered by the<br>
SBS. The TBSs that weren't selected (candidate TBS-2 and candidate TBS-3)<br>
by the MS are notified via network handover cancellation procedures. If the<br>
mobile rejects all the TBSs offered by the SBS for handover, the network not<br>
only has to notify the previous candidate TBSs prepared for the handover, but<br>
must also notify and prepare one or more new TBSs for a potential incoming<br>
handover from the MS. See e.g., IEEE 802.16 figs. 149 and 150.<br>
As can be seen from diagram 400, handover preparation is expensive<br>
in terms of the network signaling required to notify prospective TBSs and<br>
allocating resources at these TBS to support a potential handover. After a<br>
TBS offered by the SBS is selected by the mobile, all of the other candidate<br>
TBSs previously notified and prepared for a potential handover, but then<br>
rejected, must be notified by the SBS. They are notified that they were not<br>
selected so that the resources they have allocated to support a potential<br>
handover may be released.<br>
FIG. 5 is a signaling flow diagram that depicts a second example of a<br>
network initiated handover, in accordance with the prior art. The signaling flow<br>
of diagram 500 depicts network initiated handover procedures for an 802.16<br>
compliant MS in which the mobile rejects all of the TBSs offered by the SBS.<br>
After the MS rejects the TBSs offered by the SBS, the SBS/ASN must come<br>
up with a new TBS to offer the MS. However, this requires guesswork on the<br>
part of the network. The example of diagram 500 shows the network offering<br>
candidate TBS-4 to the MS after candidate TBSs 1, 2 and 3 are rejected by<br>
the MS. In this example, the MS accepts candidate TBS-4; however, it could<br>
also have rejected candidate TBS-4 and continued rejecting candidate TBSs<br>
for awhile. Such a cycle of rejections may continue until the network<br>
eventually offers a candidate TBS acceptable to the MS or for some other<br>
reason the negotiation procedure ends. Neither of these are desirable<br>
outcomes, especially when the SBS/network is performing load balancing or<br>
the SBS is being taken out of service for some reason.<br>
Thus, in view of the inefficiencies present in current network initiated<br>
handover techniques, new techniques that are able to improve network<br>
initiated handover are clearly desirable for advancing the art.<br>

embodiments that may lie within the scope of the claims.<br>
Simplicity and clarity in both illustration and description are sought to<br>
effectively enable a person of skill in the art to make, use, and best practice<br>
the present invention in view of what is already known in the art. One of skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that various modifications and changes may be made to<br>
the specific embodiments described below without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention. Thus, the specification and drawings are<br>
to be regarded as illustrative and exemplary rather than restrictive or all-<br>
encompassing, and all such modifications to the specific embodiments<br>
described below are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Various embodiments are described to address some of the<br>
inefficiencies in present-day network initiated handovers. A serving node<br>
sends a first message requesting a remote unit to handover but does not<br>
indicate any network nodes to which to handover and then receives, in<br>
response, a second message indicating a target node preferred for handover<br>
by the remote unit. The serving node then notifies the target node of a<br>
potential handover by the remote unit and sends a third message to indicate<br>
to the remote unit to proceed with a handover to the target node. By first<br>
obtaining a preferred handover target from the remote unit and then notifying<br>
that target node, a network initiated handover may be accomplished more<br>
efficiently than by using the known technique of notifying prospective nodes<br>
prior to obtaining any acceptance or preference from the remote unit as part<br>
of the handover signaling protocol.<br>
The disclosed embodiments can be more fully understood with<br>
reference to FIGs. 1-3. FIG. 1 is a block diagram depiction of a wireless<br>
communication system 100 in accordance with multiple embodiments of the<br>
present invention. At present, standards bodies such as OMA (Open Mobile<br>
Alliance), 3GPP {3rd Generation Partnership Project), 3GPP2 (3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project 2), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)<br>
802, and WiMAX Forum are developing standards specifications for wireless<br>
telecommunications systems. (These groups may be contacted via<br>
http://www.openmobilealliance.com. http://www.3qpp.orq/.<br>
http://www.3qpp2.com/. http://www.ieee802.orq/. and<br>
http://www.wimaxforum.orq/ respectively.) Communication system 100<br>
represents a system having an architecture in accordance with one or more of<br>
the WiMAX Forum and/or IEEE 802 technologies, suitably modified to<br>
implement the present invention. Alternative embodiments of the present<br>
invention may be implemented in communication systems that employ other<br>
or additional technologies such as, but not limited to, those described in the<br>
OMA, 3GPP, and / or 3GPP2 specifications.<br>
Communication system 100 is depicted in a very generalized manner.<br>
For example, system 100 is shown to simply include remote unit 101, network<br>
nodes 121-124 and signaling network 131. Network nodes 121-124 are shown<br>
having interconnectivity via signaling network 131. Network node 121 is<br>
shown providing network service to remote unit 101 using wireless interface<br>
111. The wireless interface used is in accordance with the particular access<br>
technology supported by network node 121, such as one based on IEEE<br>
802.16. Network nodes 121-124 may all utilize the same wireless access<br>
technology, or they may utilize different access technologies. Those skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that FIG. 1 does not depict all of the physical fixed<br>
network components that may be necessary for system 100 to operate but<br>
only those system components and logical entities particularly relevant to the<br>
description of embodiments herein.<br>
For example, FIG. 1 does not depict that network nodes 122-124 each<br>
comprise processing units, network interfaces and transceivers. In general,<br>
components such as processing units, transceivers and network interfaces<br>
are well-known. For example, processing units are known to comprise basic<br>
components such as, but neither limited to nor necessarily requiring,<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory devices, application-specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry. Such components are<br>
typically adapted to implement algorithms and/or protocols that have been<br>
expressed using high-level design languages or descriptions, expressed using<br>
computer instructions, expressed using signaling flow diagrams, and/or<br>
expressed using logic flow diagrams.<br>
Thus, given a high-level description, an algorithm, a logic flow, a<br>
messaging / signaling flow, and/or a protocol specification, those skilled in the<br>
art are aware of the many design and development techniques available to<br>
implement a processing unit that performs the given logic. Therefore, devices<br>
121-124 represent known devices that have been adapted, in accordance with<br>
the description herein, to implement multiple embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that aspects of<br>
the present invention may be implemented in or across various physical<br>
components and none are necessarily limited to single platform<br>
implementations. For example, a network node may be implemented in or<br>
across one or more RAN components, such as a base transceiver station<br>
(BTS) and/or a base station controller (BSC), a Node-B and/or a radio<br>
network controller (RNC), or an HRPD AN and/or PCF, or implemented in or<br>
across one or more access network (AN) components, such as an access<br>
service network (ASN) gateway and/or ASM base station (BS), an access<br>
point (AP), a wideband base station (WBS), and/or a WLAN (wireless local<br>
area network) station.<br>
Remote unit 101 and network node 121 are shown communicating via<br>
technology-dependent, wireless interface 111. Remote units, subscriber<br>
stations (SSs) and/or user equipment (UEs), may be thought of as mobile<br>
stations (MSs), mobile subscriber stations (MSSs), mobile devices or mobile<br>
nodes (MNs). In addition, remote unit platforms are known to refer to a wide<br>
variety of consumer electronic platforms such as, but not limited to, mobile<br>
stations (MSs), access terminals (ATs), terminal equipment, mobile devices,<br>
gaming devices, personal computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs).<br>
In particular, remote unit 101 comprises a processing unit (103) and<br>
transceiver (105). Depending on the embodiment, remote unit 101 may<br>
additionally comprise a keypad (not shown), a speaker (not shown), a<br>
microphone (not shown), and a display (not shown). Processing units,<br>
transceivers, keypads, speakers, microphones, and displays as used in<br>
remote units are all well-known in the art.<br>
Operation of embodiments in accordance with the present invention<br>
occurs substantially as follows, first with reference to FIG. 1. As depicted in<br>
FIG. 1, network node 121 is the current serving node for remote unit 101.<br>
Desiring a network initiated handover, network node processing unit 126<br>
sends via transceiver 125 a first message requesting remote unit 101 to<br>
handover. This first message may take the form of a handover request<br>
message, for example. Although the first message requests remote unit 101<br>
to handover, it does not indicate any network nodes to which remote unit 101<br>
may handover. Receiving this first message via remote unit transceiver 105,<br>
processing unit 103 determines one or more network nodes to which it would<br>
prefer to handover. In response to the first message, processing unit 103 then<br>
sends via transceiver 105 a second nnessage indicating at least one target<br>
node that the remote unit prefers for handover. (For the sake of example,<br>
network node 122 will be assumed to be the target node preferred by remote<br>
unit 101.) Depending on the embodiment, this second message may take the<br>
form of a handoff acknowledgement message or a handoff request message,<br>
for example.<br>
Receiving this second message via remote unit transceiver 125,<br>
processing unit 126 proceeds to notify target node 122, via network interface<br>
127, of a potential handover by remote unit 101. In some embodiments, this<br>
notification may involve participating in a procedure to prepare target node<br>
122 for a handover by remote unit 101. This procedure may take the form of<br>
passing certain network context infomnation to support target node 122 in<br>
establishing bearer connections and preparing to continue the mobile's IP<br>
session after handover. Network context information may include<br>
authenticator IDs, foreign agent IDs (for mobile IP applications), an anchor<br>
data path ID, and the latest MS context information such as MAC context.<br>
After notifying target node 122 and completing any procedures to<br>
prepare target node 122 for a handover by remote unit 101, processing unit<br>
126 sends via transceiver 125 a third message indicating to remote unit 101<br>
to proceed with a handover to target node 122. Depending on the<br>
embodiment, this third message may take the form of a handoff request<br>
message or a handoff response message. Receiving the third message,<br>
remote unit processing unit 103 may then accept handover to target node 122<br>
by sending a fourth message to serving node 121 indicating its acceptance.<br>
This fourth message may take the form of a handoff acknowledgement<br>
message, for example. In response to receiving this fourth message, serving<br>
node processing unit 126 may then proceed to notify target node 122, via<br>
network interface 127, of the remote unit's handover acceptance.<br>
As noted above, first obtaining a preferred handover target from the<br>
remote unit and then notifying that target node may accomplish a network<br>
initiated handover more efficiently than by present-day signaling techniques.<br>
As can be seen from diagrams 400 and 500, present-day handover<br>
preparation is expensive in terms of the network signaling that may be<br>
required to notify prospective target nodes and allocate resources at these<br>
nodes to support a potential handover. Only after these nodes are notified that<br>
they were not selected, do they release the resources they have allocated to<br>
support the potential handover. Various embodiments, as described above,<br>
enable networks to avoid inefficient handover scenarios such as these.<br>
Reference has been made to IEEE 802.16 embodiments throughout. A<br>
brief summary that focuses on certain IEEE 802.16 embodiments appears<br>
below to provide some additional, and more particular examples. They are<br>
intended to further the reader's understanding of the variety of possible<br>
embodiments rather than to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a signaling flow diagram that depicts a network initiated<br>
controlled handover, in accordance with some embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In diagram 200, an IEEE 802.16 MOB_BSHO-REQ is sent by the<br>
SBS to the MS to initiate a handover. The network may include one or more<br>
candidate TBSs offered to the mobile for a handover. It may also not include<br>
any TBSs. Since network initiated handovers are not as time critical as some<br>
MS initiated handovers where wireless conditions may be deteriorating<br>
rapidly, the mobile and network typically have more time to identify a suitable<br>
target BS for the mobile and prepare for the handover.<br>
In order to minimize air interface signaling, network signaling, and<br>
handover candidate TBS resources that are required to support a network<br>
initiated handover, the network initiates handover by sending IEEE 802.16<br>
MOB_BSHO-REQ from the SBS to the MS with no proposed target BSs. The<br>
network does not notify or initiate handover preparation procedures with any<br>
TBS for MS handover. The MS responds to the MOB_BSHO-REQ message,<br>
which proposes no TBSs, with an 802.16 MOB_HO-IND message. The MS<br>
includes its preferred TBS for handover in this message.<br>
Upon reception of this message from the mobile, the network initiates<br>
handover notification and preparation procedures with the MS selected TBS.<br>
No other TBSs are notified and prepared thereby minimizing network signaling<br>
and network resources. Upon completion of handover notification and<br>
preparation of the MS preferred target BS, the SBS notifies the MS to proceed<br>
with the handover by sending a new MOB_BSHO-REQ message to the MS<br>
with the MS preferred target BS proposed in the message (and no others).<br>
The MS now sends a MOB_HO-IND message accepting the handover<br>
and the TBS offered to it (its own preferred TBS) and proceeds to initiate a<br>
handover at the TBS via an 802.16 ranging procedure. Since the TBS was<br>
previously notified by the SBS of an incoming handover from the MS, it is<br>
prepared to accept the MS. Furthermore, since no other candidate TBSs were<br>
notified or prepared of an incoming handover except the TBS selected by the<br>
mobile, no candidate TBSs need to be notified of handover preparation<br>
cancellation.<br>
FIG. 3 is a signaling flow diagram that depicts a network initiated<br>
controlled handover, in accordance with other embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In diagram 300, reception of a MOB_BSHO-REQ message with no<br>
handover TBS included in the message, triggers the MS to initiate a handover<br>
by sending a MOB_MSHO-REQ message with its preferred TBS in the<br>
message. Upon reception of this message from the mobile, the network<br>
initiates handover notification and preparation procedures with the MS<br>
selected TBS. No other TBSs are notified and prepared thereby minimizing<br>
network signaling and network resources. Upon completion of handover<br>
notification and preparation of the MS prefered target BS, the SBS notifies<br>
the MS to proceed with the handover by sending a MOB_BSHO-RSP<br>
message to the MS with the MS preferred target BS proposed in the message<br>
(and no others).<br>
The MS now sends a MOB_HO-IND message accepting the handover<br>
and the TBS offered to it (its own prefen-ed TBS) and proceeds to initiate a<br>
handover at the TBS via an 802.16 ranging procedure to signal network<br>
reentry. Since the TBS was previously notified by the SBS of an incoming<br>
handover from the MS, it is prepared to accept the MS. Furthermore, since no<br>
other candidate TBSs were notified or prepared of an incoming handover<br>
except the TBS selected by the mobile, no candidate TBSs need to be notified<br>
of handover preparation cancellation.<br>
One of skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications and<br>
changes may be made to the specific embodiments described above with<br>
respect to FIGs. 1-3 without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention. Thus, the discussion of certain embodiments in greater detail above<br>
is to be regarded as illustrative and exemplary rather than restrictive or all-<br>
encompassing, and all such modifications to the specific embodiments<br>
described above are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Benefits, other advantages, and solutions to problems have been<br>
described above with regard to specific embodiments of the present invention.<br>
However, the benefits, advantages, solutions to problems, and any element(s)<br>
that may cause or result in such benefits, advantages, or solutions, or cause<br>
such benefits, advantages, or solutions to become more pronounced are not<br>
to be construed as a critical, required, or essential feature or element of any<br>
or all the claims.<br>
As used herein and in the appended claims, the term "comprises,"<br>
"comprising," or any other variation thereof is intended to refer to a non-<br>
exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article of manufacture, or<br>
apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only those<br>
elements in the list, but may include other elements not expressly listed or<br>
inherent to such process, method, article of manufacture, or apparatus. The<br>
temns a or an, as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The term<br>
plurality, as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term<br>
another, as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. Unless<br>
otherwise indicated herein, the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and<br>
second, and the like, are used solely to distinguish one entity or action from<br>
another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual<br>
such relationship or order between such entities or actions.<br>
The terms including and/or having, as used herein, are defined as<br>
comprising (i.e., open language). The term coupled, as used herein, is<br>
defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Terminology derived from the word "indicating" (e.g.,<br>
"indicates" and Indication") is intended to encompass all the various<br>
techniques available for communicating or referencing the information or<br>
object being indicated. Some, but not all examples of techniques available for<br>
communicating or referencing the information or object being indicated include<br>
the conveyance of the information or object being indicated, the conveyance<br>
of an identifier of the information or object being indicated, the conveyance of<br>
information used to generate the information or object being indicated, the<br>
conveyance of some part or portion of the infonnation or object being<br>
indicated, the conveyance of some derivation of the infonnation or object<br>
being indicated, and the conveyance of some symbol representing the<br>
infonnation or object being indicated. The terms program, computer program,<br>
and computer instructions, as used herein, are defined as a sequence of<br>
instructions designed for execution on a computer system. This sequence of<br>
instructions may include, but is not limited to, a subroutine, a function, a<br>
procedure, an object method, an object implementation, an executable<br>
application, an applet, a servlet, a shared library/dynamic load library, a<br>
source code, an object code and/or an assembly code.<br>
What is claimed is:<br>
Claims<br>
1. A method for supporting a network initiated handover in a wireless<br>
network comprising:<br>
sending, by a serving node, a first message requesting a remote unit to<br>
handover but not indicating any network nodes to which to handover;<br>
receiving, by the serving node in response to the first message, a<br>
second message indicating a target node preferred for handover by the<br>
remote unit;<br>
notifying the target node by the serving node of a potential handover by<br>
the remote unit, in response to receiving the second message;<br>
sending, by the serving node, a third message indicating to the remote<br>
unit to proceed with a handover to the target node.<br>
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first message comprises a<br>
handover request message.<br>
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the second message comprises one of<br>
a handoff acknowledgement message or a handoff request message.<br>
4. The method of claim 1, wherein notifying the target node of a potential<br>
handover by the remote unit comprises<br>
participating in a procedure to prepare the target node for a handover<br>
by the remote unit.<br>
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the third message comprises one of a<br>
handoff request message or a handoff response message.<br>
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising<br>
receiving, by the serving node, a fourth message indicating acceptance<br>
of the handover to the target node by the remote unit;<br>
notifying the target node of the acceptance of the handover to the<br>
target node by the remote unit, in response to receiving the fourth message.<br>
7. A method for supporting a network initiated handover in a wireless<br>
network comprising:<br>
receiving, by a remote unit from a serving network node, a first<br>
message requesting the remote unit to handover but not indicating any<br>
network nodes to which to handover;<br>
sending, by the remote unit in response to the first message, a second<br>
message indicating a target node preferred for handover by the remote unit;<br>
receiving, by a remote unit from the serving network node, a third<br>
message indicating to the remote unit to proceed with a handover to the target<br>
node.<br>
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the first message comprises a<br>
handover request message.<br>
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the second message comprises one of<br>
a handoff acknowledgement message or a handoff request message.<br>
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the third message comprises one of a<br>
handoff request message or a handoff response message.<br>
<br>
Various embodiments are described to address some of the inefficiencies in present-day network initiated handovers.<br>
A serving node (121 ) sends a first message requesting a remote unit (101 ) to handover but does not indicate any network<br>
nodes to which to handover and then receives, in response, a second message indicating a target node (e.g., 122) preferred for handover<br>
by the remote unit. The serving node then notifies the target node of a potential handover by the remote unit and sends a<br>
third message to indicate to the remote unit to proceed with a handover to the target node. By first obtaining a preferred handover<br>
target from the remote unit and then notifying that target node, a network initiated handover may be accomplished more efficiently<br>
than by using the known technique of notifying prospective nodes prior to obtaining any acceptance or preference from the remote<br>
unit.</td>
