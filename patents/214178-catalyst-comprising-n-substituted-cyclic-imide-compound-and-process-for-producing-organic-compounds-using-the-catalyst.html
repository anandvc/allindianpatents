COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10}Rule 13]<br>
CATALYST COMPRISING N-SUBSTITUTED CYCLIC IMIDE COMPOUND AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS USING THE CATALYST<br>
DAICEL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD., a Japanese Company, of    1 Teppo - Cho, Sakai - Shi, Osaka 590-8501, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
for oxidation, nitration, carboxylation, reaction for the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, and other reactions and to a process for producing an organic compound using the catalyst.<br>
Background Art<br>
An oxidation reaction is one of the most basic reactions in the field of organic chemical industry, and various oxidation processes have been developed.  From the viewpoints of resources and environmental issues, a catalytic oxidation process, in which molecular oxygen or air is directly used as an oxidizing agent, is preferred.- However, the catalytic oxidation process generally requires high temperatures and/or high pressures for activation of oxygen or, alternatively, must be performed in the co-existence of a reducing agent such as an aldehyde to proceed the reaction under mild conditions. Accordingly, such a conventional catalytic oxidation process cannot easily and efficiently produce an alcohol or a carboxylic acid under mild conditions.<br><br>
Lower hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane are nitrated using nitric acid or nitrogen dioxide at high temperatures^f from 250°C to 300QC. However, when a hydrocarbon having a large number of carbon atoms is nitrated under the above condition, the substrate is decomposed, and a target nitro compound cannot be obtained in a high yield. To nitrate hydrocarbons, a method using mixed acid (a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid) is widely employed.  However, this method requires large amounts of a strong acid in a high concentration.<br>
Additionally, few processes are known for efficiently and directly introducing carboxyl groups into hydrocarbons under mild conditions.<br>
A variety of processes are known for producing organic sulfur acids or salts thereof.  For example, processes for producing a sulfonic acid include a process of oxidizing a thiol or disulfide with an oxidizing agent, a process of allowing an aromatic hydrocarbon to react with anhydrous SC&gt;3-pyridine or chlorosulfuric acid by using 3 Friedel-Crafts reaction, and a process of synthetically obtaining a sulfonic acid by subjecting an unsaturated compound to free-radical addition. These processes, however, require extreme reaction conditions or inevitably produce large amounts of by-products. Additionally, no processes for directly, and"efficiently sulfonating non-aromatic hydrocarbons have been known..<br>
Processes are known in which a variety of compounds are<br>
3<br><br>
added to unsaturated compounds each having a carbon-carbon double bond or heteroatom-containing compounds and thereby yield useful organic compounds. For example, when an active methylene compound such as a malonic diester is allowed to react with an olefin having an electron attractive group, such as acrylonitrile, in the presence of a base, a carbon-carbon bond is formed as a result of a nucleophilic addition reaction and thereby yields an addition product (Michael addition reaction) . When two types of carbonyl compounds are treated in the presence of an acid or a base, one carbonyl compound is nucleophilically added to the other to form a carbon-carbon bond and thereby yields an aldol condensate.<br>
These processes, however, are generally performed in the presence of an acid or base and cannot be applied to compounds each having a substituent that is susceptible to the acid or base.  Iii addition, these processes cannot allow, for example, a hydroxymethyl group, an alkoxymethyl group, an acyl group or a tertiary-carbon atom to directly combine with a carbon atom constituting an unsaturated boned of an unsaturated compound or with a methine carbon atom of a bridged cyclic compound.<br>
Addition reactions to a carbon-carbon double bond in accordance with a radical mechanism or coupling reactions to form a carbon-carbon bond are also known. However, there are few processes that can  efficiently yield addition or<br>
4<br><br>
substitution reaction products or derivatives thereof by action of, for example, molecular oxygen under mild conditions. Some processes are known as production processes of hydroxy-y-butyrolactone derivatives.  For example, European Patent Publication EP--A-210368 6 discloses a process for synthetically obtainirtq pantolactone by allowinq qlyoxylic acid to react with isobutylene. Likewise, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 61-282373 discloses a process for synthetically obtaining pantolactone by allowing hydrated glyoxylic acid to react with t-butyl alcohol. Tetrahedron/ 933 (1979) discloses a process for synthetically obtaining pantolactone- This process includes the steps of hydrolyzing 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-5,5,5-trichloro-l-pentene to yield 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-4-pentenoic acid and cyclizing this compound in the presence of hydrochloric acid.  In addition, The Chemical Society of Japan, Spring Conference Proceedings II, pp. 1015 (1998) reports that light irradiation to a mixture solution containing an et-acetoxy- -unsaturated carboxylic ester and 2-propanol yields a corresponding a-acetoxy-y,y-dimethyl-y-butyrolactone derivative. However, each of these processes employs a material that is not easily available or requires special conditions for the reaction. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No. 8-38909 and No. 9-327626 each propose an oxidation catalyst<br>
5<br><br>
the imide compound in combination with, for example, a transition metal compound as a catalyst for oxidizing an organic substrate with molecular oxygen.  Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-239730 discloses a process, in which a substrate is allowed to react with at least one reactant selected from (i) nitrogen oxides and (.ii) mixtures of carbon monoxide and oxygen in the presence of the imide compound and thereby at least one functional group selected from nitro group and carboxyl group is introduced into the substrate.  PCT International Publication No. WO00/35835 discloses a process, in which two compounds are allowed to react with each other in the presence of a specific imide compound and a radical generator with respect to the imide compound and thereby yield an addition or substitution reaction product or an oxidized product thereof in accordance with a radical mechanism. These processes using the imide. compounds can introduce an oxygen-atom-containing group such as hydroxyl group, nitro group or carboxyl group into a substrate or can form a carbon-carbon bond. However, they are still insufficient in yields of the target compounds, stability of the catalysts or amounts of the catalysts.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst that can yield an organic compound with a<br>
6<br><br>

When the compound (A2) having a carbon-heteroatom double bond (e.g., the carbonyl--group-containing compound )is employed as the compound (A), a bond between a carbon atom relating to the carbon-heteroatom double bond (e.g., a carbonyl carbon atom) and an atom adjacent to the carbon atom is broken, and an atomic group containing the carbon-heteroatom double bond (e.g., an acyl group) is combined with the aforementioned position of the compound (Bl),, (B2) or (B3) to yield an addition or substitution reaction product or a derivative thereof. When the compound (A3) having a methine carbon atom is<br>
58<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
used as the compound (A) capable of forming a radical, themethine carbon atom is combined with the aforementioned position of the compound (Bl) , (B2) or (B3) to yield an addition or substitution reaction product or a derivative thereof.<br>
Generally, the use of the unsaturated compound (Bl) as the radical scavenging compound (B) yields an addition reaction product, and the use of the compound (B2) having a methine carbon atom as the compound (B) yields a substitution reaction product (e.g., a coupling product).<br>
The reaction between the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (B4) as the radical scavenging compound (B) with the compound (A) capable of forming a radical yields an organic compound having an oxygen-atom-containing group (e.g., hydroxyl group, oxo group, carboxyl group, nitro group, or sulfur acid group) depending on the type of the oxygen-atom-containing reactant.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, a complicated organic compound can be obtained through one step by using two or more types of the compounds (A) capable of forming a radical and/or the radical scavenging compounds (B) to thereby invite sequential addition or substitution reactions.  For example, when the unsaturated compound (Bl) and oxygen (B4-1) as the radical scavenging compounds (B) are allowed to react with the compound (A) , a group derived from the compound (A) is combined with one of the two carbon atoms constituting the unsaturated bond as mentioned above, and a hydroxyl group derived<br>
59<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
from the oxygen is introduced into the other carbon atom.<br>
Areactionmechanismin the process of the present invention is not clarified in detail, but is supposed as follows. During the reaction, an oxidized active species [e.g., imido-N-oxy radical (&gt;NO) ] is formed, the oxidized active species withdraws a hydrogen from the compound (A) and allows the compound (A) to forma radical, for example, at the carbon atom at the adjacent position to the heteroatom in the compound (Al) , at the carbon atom relating to the carbon-heteroatom double bond in the compound (A2) , at the methine carbon atom in the compound (A3) , or at the carbon atom at the adjacent position to the unsaturated bond in the compound (A4) ; the thus-formed radical reacts with the compound (B) and thereby yields a corresponding addition or.substitution reaction product.<br>
. The above-formed addition or substitution reaction product may further undergo, for example, dehydration reaction, cyclization reaction, decarboxylation reaction, rearrangement reaction, or isomerization reaction in the reaction system depending on the structure thereof or reaction conditions," and thereby yields a corresponding derivative.<br>
The reaction between the compound (A) capable of forming a radical and the radical scavenging compound (B) should preferably be performed under conditions with minimal polymerization inhibitors (e.g., hydroquinone) .  For example, the proportion of the polymerization inhibitor in the reaction<br>
60<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
system should preferably be less than or equal to 1000 ppm, and more preferably less than or equal to 100 ppm.  If the proportion of the polymerization inhibitor exceeds 1000 ppm, a reaction rate is liable to decrease, and the imide catalyst and/or the co-catalyst has to be used in large amounts in some cases. In contrast, when the proportion of the polymerization inhibitor in the reaction system is low., the reaction rate increases to increase a yield, and the reaction results have a high reproducibility to stably yield a target compound.  The unsaturated compounds (Bl) or other compounds for use in commercial, to which a polymerization inhibitor is added, should preferably be subjected to elimination of the polymerization inhibitor by, for example, distillation, prior to the reaction. The same goes for" any reaction in which the compound (A) is allowed to react with the compound (B) in the presence of the imide compound.<br>
By using an appropriate combination of the compound (A) capable of forming a radical and the radical scavenging compound (B) in the reaction according to the present invention, various organic compounds as mentioned below can be obtained. 1.

- 9 7 -<br>
oxygen-atom-containing reactant (B4) and thereby yields an organic compound having an oxygen-atom-containing group.<br>
This reaction is performed in the presence of, or in the absence of, a solvent.  Such solvents include the aforementioned solvents.  The amount of the catalytic imide compound is, for example, from about 0.0000001 to about 1 mole, preferably from about 0 . 000001 to about 0 . 5mole, more preferably from about 0 . 00001 to about 0 . 4 mole, and often from about 0.0001 to about 0.3 mole, relative to 1 mole of the compound (A) .  This reaction is significantly accelerated in many cases when a promoter such as the metallic compound (e.g., vanadium compound, molybdenum compound, manganese compound or cobalt compound) is used in combination.<br>
When the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (B4) is in the form of a gas, it may be diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or argon gas . Each of the oxygen-atom-containing reactants (B4) can be used alone or in combination.  By using two or more types of the oxygen-atom-containing reactants (B4) in combination, two or more types of different functional groups can be introduced into the molecule.  Such functional groups include, for example, hydroxyl group, oxo group, carboxyl group, nitro group and sulfonic acid group.  In the combination use, two types or more of thee oxygen-atom-containing reactants. (B4) can be used concurrently or Sequentially.<br>
The amount of the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (84)<br><br>
- 98 -<br>
depends on the type thereof and can appropriately be selected in view of reactivity and operability. For example, when oxygen (B4-1) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (B4), the amount of oxygen is equal to or more than about 0.5 mole (e.g., equal to or more than about 1 mole), preferably from about 1 to about 100 moles, and more preferably from about 2 to about 50 moles, relative to 1 mole of the compound (A) .

In this case, the molar ratio of carbon monoxide to oxygen is from about 1/99 to about 99.99/0.01, and preferably from about 10/90 to about 99/1.<br>
When the nitrogen oxide (B4-3) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (B4), the amount of the nitrogen oxide can appropriately be selected depending on the types of the nitrogen oxide and the compound (A) and may be equal to or more than 1 mole or may be less than 1 mole, relative to 1 mole of the compound (A) . When the amount of the nitrogen oxide (e.g., nitrogen dioxide) is less than 1 mole (e.g., equal to or more than about 0 . 0001 mole and less than 1 mole) , preferably<br>
99<br><br>
- 99 -<br>
from about 0.001 to about 0.8 mole, and more preferably from about 0.005 to about 0.25 mole, relative to 1 mole of the compound (A) , the conversion from the nitrogen oxide and the selectivity of the reaction can significantly be improved.<br>
By using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in combination with oxygen, the rate of a reaction such as nitration reaction can be significantly improved. In this case, the amount of oxygen is equal to or more than about 0.5 mole (e.g., equal.to or more than about 1 mole) , preferably from about 1 to about 100 moles, and more preferably from about 2 to about 50 moles, relative to 1 mole of nitrogen dioxide.<br>
When the sulfur oxide (B4-4) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, the amount of the sulfur oxide can appropriately be selected depending on the types of the sulfur oxide and the compound (A) and is generally from about 1 to about 50 moles, and preferably from about 1.5 to about 30 moles, relative to 1 mole of the compound (A) . The reaction can be performed in large excess of the sulfur oxide. When the sulfur oxide (e.g., sulfur dioxide) is used in combination with oxygen, the molar ratio of the sulfur oxide to the oxygen is, for example, from about 10/90 to about 90/10 and more preferably from about 30/70 to about 70/30.<br>
A reaction temperature can appropriately be selected depending on, for example, the types of the compound (A) and the oxygen-atom-containing reactant.  For example, when oxygen<br>
100<br><br>
- 100 -<br>
(B4-1) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, the reaction temperature is from about 0°C to about 300°C and preferably from about 20°C to about 250°C.<br>
When carbon monoxide (B4-2) and oxygen (B.4-1) are used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactants, the reaction temperature is, for example, from about 0°C to about 2-00°C and preferably from about 10°C to about 150°C. When the nitrogen oxide (B4-3) or sulfur oxide (B4-4) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant (including the case where oxygen is used in combination), the reaction temperature is, for example, from about 0°C to about 150°C and preferably from about 10°C to about 125°C. The reaction can be performed at atmospheric pressure or under a pressure (under a load) . When the reaction is performed under a pressure, the pressure is generally from about 0.1 to about 10 MPa, and preferably from about 0.2 to about 7 MPa.  The reaction can be performed in a conventional system such as a batch system, semi-batch system or continuous system.<br>
•After the completion of the reaction, reaction products can be separated and purified by a technique such as filtration, concentration, distillation, extraction, crystallization, recrystallization, adsorption, column chromatography and other separation means, or any combination of these separation means .<br>
This process can produce a reaction product corresponding to the oxygen-atom-containing reactant in a high yield under<br>
101-<br><br>
- 101 -<br>
mild conditions.<br>
Specifically, when  oxygen (B4-1) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, an oxidation reaction proceeds and thereby yields a corresponding oxidation product [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No, 8-38909.. No, 9-327626, No,-10-286467r and No, 2000-219650 (processes using catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compounds)].  For example, when the heteroatom-containing compound (Al) having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adjacent position to the heteroatom is used,as the compound (A) , a carbon atom at the adjacent position to the heteroatom is oxidized. For example, a primary alcohol yields a corresponding aldehyde or carboxylic acid, and a secondary alcohol yields a corresponding ketone. A 1,3-diol yields a corresponding hydroxyketone., and a 1,2-diol yields a corresponding a carboxylic acid as a result of oxidative cleavage [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No. 2000-212116 and NO.. 2000-219652 (processes using catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compounds) ] . An ether yields a corresponding ester or acid anhydride [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 10-316610 (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compound) ] . . In addition, a primary or secondary alcohol yields hydrogen peroxide [refer to PCT International Publication No. WO00/46145  (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy<br>
\oV<br><br>
- 102 -<br>
cyclic imide compound)].<br>
When the compound (A2) having a carbon-heteroatom double bond is used as the compound (A), an oxidation product corresponding to the type of the heteroatom can  be obtained. For example, by oxidizing a ketone, a carboxylic acid or another product is produced as a result of cleavage.  For example, a cyclic ketone such as cyclohexanone yields a dicarboxylic acid such as adipic acid. By using the heteroatom-containing compound (Al) having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adjacent position to the heteroatom, such as a secondary alcohol (e.g., benzhydrol), is used as a co-reactant (co-oxidizing agent), a Baeyer-Villiger type reaction proceeds under mild conditions. As a result, a cyclic ketone yields a corresponding lactone, and a chain ketone yields a corresponding ester in high yields [refer to PCT International Publication No. WO99/50204 (cases where catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide. compounds are used)].  In addition, an aldehyde yields a corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
By using the compound (A3) having a methine carbon atom as the compound (A) , an alcohol derivative having a hydroxyl group introduced into the methine carbon in a high yield. For example, by oxidizing a bridged cyclic hydrocarbon (A3-la) such as adamantane, alcohol derivatives each having a hydroxyl group at a bridgehead position, such as 1-adamantanol, 1,3-adamantanediol and 1,3, 5-adamantanetriol, can be produced<br>
103<br><br>
- 103 -<br>
with high selectivity. The chain compound (A3-2) having a methine carbon atom, such as isobutane, can yield a tertiary alcohol such as t-butanol in a high yield [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 10-310543 (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compound)).<br>
By using the compound (A4) having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adjacent position to an unsaturated bond as the compound (A) , theadjacent position to the unsaturatedbondis efficiently oxidized and thereby yields, for example, an alcohol, carboxylic acid or ketone.  For example, a.compound having a methyl group at the adjacent position to an unsaturated bond yields a primary alcohol or carboxylic acid in a high yield [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No. 8-38909, No. 9-327626 and No. 11-106377 (processes using catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compounds)]. Likewise, a compound having a methylene group or methine group at the adjacent position to an unsaturated bond yields a secondary or tertiary alcohol, ketone or carboxylic acid, depending on reaction conditions.<br>
More specifically, an aromatic compound having an alkyl group or a lower-order oxidized group thereof combined with an aromatic ring yields an aromatic carboxylic acid having a carboxyl group combined with the aromatic ring as a.result of oxidation of the alkyl group or the lower-order oxidized group<br>
104<br><br>

Likewise, when the compound (A4) having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adjacent position to an unsaturated bond is used, a carbon atom relating to the carbon-hydrogen bond is nitrated. The non-aromatic cyclic hydrocarbon (A5), such as cyclohexane, yields a corresponding cyclic nitro compound having a nitro group combined with a carbon atom constituting a ring. Even the straight-chain alkane (A9), such as hexane, can yield a<br>

When nitrogen dioxide is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, the nitration reaction can efficiently proceed by using the substrate in excess to nitrogen dioxide [refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-136339 (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compound)].<br>
When a compound having a methyl group at the adjacent position to an aromatic ring (at the "benzyl position"), such as toluene, is used as the compound (A), a nitro group is introduced into the carbon atom of the methyl group. Under some conditions, the methyl group is converted into a formyl group and thereby yields a corresponding aromatic aldehyde (e.g., benzaldehyde) , or a nitro group is introduced into the aromatic ring in the resulting compound. The use of a compound having a methylene group at the adjacent position to an aromatic ring (e.g., ethylbenzene) as the substrate yields a nitro compound (e.g., a-nitrobenzene) , in which the methylene group is nitrated, and under some reaction conditions, yields an oxime compound (e.g., acetophenone oxime) where the methylene group is converted into an oxime.<br>
By using nitrogen monoxide as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, an ether can yield a corresponding aldehyde as a result of cleavage of the ether bond [Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications No. 11-315036 and No. 11-254977 (processes using catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide<br>

By allowing a chain or cyclic compound having a methylene group to react with the nitrogen oxide such as nitrogen monoxide in the presence of the catalytic imide compound and a halogen (e.g., chlorine) or a Beckmann rearrangement catalyst, a corresponding amide or lactam is obtained [refer to Japanese Patent Application No. 11-372177 (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compound)]. For example, cyclohexane yields s-caprolactam.<br>
When the nitric acids are used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant, a nitration reaction predominantly proceeds and thereby yields, for example, a corresponding nitro compound, as in the use of the nitrogen oxide (B4-3) [refer to Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-58054 (a process using a catalytic 5-membered N-hydroxy cyclic imide compound)].

(A3) having a methine carbon atom is used as the substrate, the methine carbon atom is nitrated. When the non-aromatic cyclic hydrocarbon (A5) is used as the substrate, a nitro group is introduced into a carbon atom constituting a ring. In this case, a cycloalkane, such as cyclohexane, yields a corresponding nitrocycloalkane. In the non-aromatic heterocyclic compound having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adjacent position to the heteroatom, a carbon atom relating to the carbon-hydrogen bond is nitrated. Likewise, the straight-chain alkane (A9), such as hexane, yields a corresponding nitroalkane.<br>
This reaction is supposed to proceed in the following manner. The imide compound reacts with the nitric acids and thereby yields an imido-N-oxy radical, the radical withdraws a hydrogen atom from the substrate and thereby yields another radical, and to the resulting radical, nitrogen dioxide formed in the reaction system is added and" thereby yields a corresponding nitro compound.<br>
When the sulfur oxide (B.4-4) is used as the oxygen-atom-containing reactant,. a sulfonation and/or sulfination reaction proceeds and thereby yields a corresponding organic sulfur acid or a salt thereof.  For example, when the compound (A3) having a methine carbon atom is used as the. compound (A) , a sulfur acid group is introduced into the methine carbon atom. When the compound (A4) having a carbon-hydrogen bond at the adj acent position to an unsaturated<br>

bond is used, a sulfur acid group (e.g., a sulfonic acid group or sulf inic acid group) is introduced into a carbon atom relating to the carbon-hydrogen bond.  The non-aromatic cyclic hydrocarbon (A5) , such as cyclohexane, yields an organic sulfur acid having a sulfur acid group combined with a carbon atom constituting a ring. The formed organic sulfur acid can be converted into a corresponding salt thereof according to conventional techniques. For example, the salt can be obtained by reacting"the organic sulfur acid with an alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal hydrogencarbonate, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal carbonate, amine, thiourea, or isothiourea in an appropriate solvent such as water.<br>
