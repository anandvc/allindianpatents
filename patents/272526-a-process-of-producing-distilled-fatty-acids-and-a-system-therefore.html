PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following complete specification particularly describes the nature<br>
of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process of producing Distilled Fatty Acid (DFA) and a system for manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
During the last decade, many companies have decided to switch over to distilled fatty acid (DFA) as a main feedstock for manufacturing premium soaps replacing the mix of oils used earlier. In order to meet this increased demand, the installed capacity of DFA plants in the country has been rapidly increasing. Thus the need to make the DFA process more efficient, simple and economical is of vital importance for the industry and the country at large.<br>
Conventionally, Distilled Fatty Acid (DFA) is produced from crude split oil by vacuum distillation. Distillation is carried out at low pressure (less than 6 mm Hg) and at about 240 degree Centigrade temperature. A small amount of steam is sparged in the crude split oil to facilitate distillation rate. Steam ejector with barometric condensers system provides the vacuum. Heat for vaporization of Distilled fatty acid is provided by thermic fluid heater and DFA is condensed in surface type water cooled condensers. After vaporization of fatty acids, residue containing mostly degraded oil remains in the distillation still, which is continuously removed, cooled and stored for final disposal. Stainless steel 304L or SS316 is a material of construction for all components of the plant.<br>
The conventional process of producing DFA as outlined in Fig 1 comprises of following steps:<br>
a.   Split oil containing residual oil and free fatty acid having very dark black-red<br>
color is continuously fed to distillation column, where the distillation takes<br>
place at about 240 degree centigrade<br><br><br>
b.	Distillation column mass is continuously heated in "reboiler", where it is<br>
heated by hot thermic fluid to vaporize the free fatty acids at a pressure less<br>
than 6 mm Hg. (vacuum of 754-756 mm Hg.), at about 240 degree centigrade<br>
c.	Fatty acids vaporized are taken to surface type water cooled condensers to<br>
condense all the fatty acid. Cooling is done by cooling water obtained from<br>
cooling water system.<br>
d.	Vacuum (pressure of less than 6 mm Hg.) is produced by multi-stage steam -jet<br>
ejectors and barometric condenser . Steam is used as motive fluid and<br>
cooling water for condensing the steam in barometric condenser to produce the<br>
desired vacuum.<br>
e.	Thermic fluid is heated in thermic fluid boiler system by fuel oil. The hot<br>
thermic fluid thus obtained from thermic fluid boiler system is used to provide<br>
heat for vaporization of free fatty acids .<br>
f.	Residue after distillation of free fatty acids is drawn out from distillation<br>
column continuously , is cooled and transferred to residue tank for storage.<br>
g.	DFA condensed in surface cooled condensers is cooled up to 40 degree<br>
centigrade by cooling water in separate cooler / heat exchanger and stored<br>
In conventional process, distillation is carried out under vacuum because in the presence of oxygen. Fatty acids degrade at high temperature. Due to vacuum, ingress of oxygen is minimized and vaporization can be carried out at lower temperatures ..<br>
The conventional process suffers from following limitations:<br>
a.	It requires large amount of steam and cooling water towards generation of<br>
vacuum .<br>
b.	Material loss in the barometric condensers leads to generation of oily<br>
effluent creating effluent and pollution. .<br>
c.	Fatty Acid Distillation plant with vacuum systems are expensive<br><br><br>
d.	Plant with vacuum system has operating difficulties  resulting in downtime<br>
on the plant, in case there is a minor leakage.<br>
e.	Energy consumption is very high.<br>
Utilities consumptions in the conventional process are as follows:<br>
TABLE 1 <br>
Typical Utilities Consumptions for 1000 kg of DFA produced :<br><br>
H P Steam, Kilograms	250<br>
L P Steam, Kilograms	100<br>
Fuel oil, Kilocalories	200,000<br>
Power, Kilowatt hours	30<br>

Effluent, Cubic Meter	3<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a novel process for manufacturing Distilled Fatty Acid (DFA).<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a system for manufacturing DFA with no vacuum requirement for the processing and with less steam and cooling water requirement.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a system for manufacturing DFA, which operates with less fuel consumption.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a system for manufacturing DFA, which is easy to operate.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a system for manufacturing DFA, which eliminates the risk of frequent downtime of the system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, attempt is made to minimize or eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art processes. In the present invention, a new process is provided for manufacturing DFA and a system is provided for manufacturing DFA in accordance with the said new process.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, fatty acid distillation is carried out at marginally higher pressure than atmospheric pressure and at temperature equal or less than 260 degree centigrade. In this distillation process, nitrogen is used as carrier gas. Pressure being higher than atmospheric, ingress of oxygen in the system is prevented. DFA is condensed in the water-cooled condensers and nitrogen is recirculated via process blower. Flow rate of nitrogen can be adjusted through speed of process blower to regulate the fatty acid distillation rate.<br>
Vacuum system including barometric condenser is not required. Cooling water requirement in the barometric condensers is eliminated and cooling water quantity in the condensers is considerably reduced as re circulated gas and crude split oil is preheated in the condensers<br>
Depending on the concentration of free fatty acid in crude split oil, quantity of nitrogen required is varied with the help of process blower. However, all the nitrogen is recycled except the bleed-off, which is required in case of organic non-condensable build-up in the system.<br><br><br>
Quantity of nitrogen required is to fill up the complete system as initial charge and subsequently, have marginal make-up as required in-lieu-of the bleed-off. Heat for distillation and vaporization of distilled fatty acid is provided by thermic fluid heater. DFA is condensed in water cooled condensers and stored. After vaporization of fatty acids, residue containing mostly degraded oil remains in the distillation still, and is continuously removed, cooled and transferred for storage.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing distilled fatty acid comprising the steps of feeding pre heated crude split oil and distilling the same in a distillation column in an atmosphere of a carrier gas such as nitrogen, steam or inert gases, said distillation being carried out at a temperature below 260°c and at a pressure marginally above atmospheric pressure condensing the vapours of fatty acids therefrom in at least one condenser, cooling and collecting the condensate (DFA), recycling the carrier gas from the condenser, to the distillation column after heating.<br>
This invention also relates to an integrated system for producing distilled fatty acid from crude split oil comprising means for heating crude split oil, a distillation column connected thereto and leading to atleast one condenser, means for supplying a carrier gas such as nitrogen, steam and the like to said distillation column, said condenser means having means for recycling the carrier gas therefrom to said distillation column, means for collecting the condensate and cooling means for cooling the condensers and conventional instrumentation and controls for operating the same.<br>
