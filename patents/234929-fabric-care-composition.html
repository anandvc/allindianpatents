FABRIC CARE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
5  The present invention relates to novel polysaccharide-<br>
grafted polymer particles and their uses, such as delivery to fabric during laundering.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, such as a fabric, is a well known method of imparting desirable properties to the substrate.  In laundry applications the range of "benefit agents" is diverse and includes fabric<br>
15  softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, shape<br>
retention agents, anti-crease agents, ease of ironing aids, perfumes, lubricants, texturising agents, insecticide repellents, fungicides, photofading inhibitors, fluorescers, sunscreens and many others.  Deposition of a benefit agent<br>
20  is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric conditioning to confer, for example, softening benefit to the fabric.<br>
Conventionally, the deposition of the benefit agent has had 25 	to rely upon attractive forces between the oppositely 	charged substrate and the benefit agent.  For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the 30  cotton so as to absorb onto it.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
However, adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite charge to that of the benefit agent.  For example, <br>
5  cationic fabric conditioning agents are incompatible with anionic surfactants in laundry washing compositions, hence fabric conditioning products are usually separate from main wash products.  Furthermore, the substantivity of the benefit agent can be severely reduced and/or the deposition<br>
10  rate of the benefit agent can be reduced because of the presence of incompatible charged species in the compositions.  The conventional way around this problem is to add benefit agents during the rinsing step of a treatment process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged<br>
15  chemical species present in the main wash compositions.<br>
This has clear cost disadvantages to the consumer and instigates the need for two separate products instead of one.<br>
20  However, in recent times, it has been proposed to deliver a benefit agent in a form whereby it is substituted onto another chemical moiety, which itself has an affinity for the substrate in question.<br>
25  Prior Art<br>
WO 99/36469 is directed to a polysaccharide conjugate capable of binding cellulose.  Locust bean gum (LBG) is grafted to proteins, such as enzymes or anti-bodies or <br>
30  perfume loaded particles.  This is delivered to the fabric during the laundering.  The LBG attachment is achieved by<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
enzymatic oxidation of the LBG using galactose oxidase to introduce aldehyde groups.  These aldehyde groups are then reacted with glucose oxidase (using sodium cyanoborohydride) to form an LBG with chemically bound glucose oxidase.  This <br>
5	procedure for preparing the material is cumbersome and involves numerous steps using xconventional' organic (enzymatic) chemistry, such as purification of LBG, introducing aldehyde functionality to the LBG and coupling of this to an enzyme (via the enzymes hydroxyl <br>
10  functionality).<br>
WO 99/36470 is also directed to polysaccharide conjugates that are able to bind cellulose, where the polysaccharide is attached to a particle containing perfume.  The particle may<br>
15  be a range of materials, including silica.  Perfume is<br>
allowed to infuse into macroporous silica particles simply by absorption, adsorption, impregnation and/or encapsulation.  The polysaccharide, e.g. LBG, is then merely added to the perfumed particles and is physically adsorbed<br>
20  onto the particle surface.  The LBG aids deposition in a wash environment.<br>
European patent application number 01306632.9 is directed to a water dispersible particle comprising a deposition<br>
25  enhancing part of one  or more polymeric units and a benefit<br>
agent attached to the deposition enhancing part.  Preferably the deposition aid has a hydrolysable group (based on esters), such as Cellulose Mono-Acetate (CMA).  The modified particles are prepared by reaction of acid functional beads<br>
30  by a cumbersome multi-step conventional organic chemistry<br>
technique. This requires several time consuming (and<br><br>

commercially nonviable for high volume production) centrifugation stages and the preparation of an amine functional CMA by reaction of CMA with ethylene diamine using carbonyl diimidazole as coupling agent.  The amine <br>
5  functional CMA is then reacted with acid functional beads (obtained externally) using ethyl dimethyl aminopropyl carbodimide as coupler.  This results in CMA grafted particles which exhibit enhanced wash deposition.<br>
10  Our GB patent application number 0229806.5 is directed towards a process for the preparation of polysaccharide grafted latex particles which comprises conventional emulsion polymerisation and to the materials thus produced. The particles have been used as carriers for benefit agents,<br>
15  including softeners, for deposition under main wash<br>
conditions.  However, constraints on the amount of benefit agents which can be incorporated into the particles and the types of monomer units that can be used, which are inherent to conventional emulsion polymerisation, are inevitable.<br>
20<br>
Despite these advances, the need remains for more efficient deposition systems which are more cost effective and which are capable of delivering a wider range of benefit agents under a range of use conditions (e.g. main wash conditions).<br>
25<br>
We have now surprisingly found that polysaccharide-grafted<br>
polymer particles wherein the polysaccharide comprises P-1,4 links and wherein the polymer particle comprises selected hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomer units, result in greater <br>
30  benefit delivery to the substrate.  These particles can be produced by miniemulsion polymerisation, as it is not<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention 5<br>
The present invention is directed towards novel polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles, such as latex particles.  The particles may contain additional benefit agents and/or act as the benefit agent itself.  We have <br>
10	found that such polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles have been deposited during the main wash onto fabric, preferably cotton, at levels of from 8 to 28 times greater than non-polysaccharide control particles.<br>
15  The term "latex" or "latex particle" as used herein is<br><br>
defined as a stable colloidal dispersion of a polymeric substance in an aqueous medium.  The polymer particles are usually approximately spherical and of typical colloidal dimensions.  Particle diameters may range from about 30 to 2 0  50 0 nm (The Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Second Edition, Volume 8, Page 647, John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1987)) .<br>
The Monomers 25<br>
The polymer particle of the invention comprises<br>
a)	hydrophobic water insoluble monomer units, or<br>
b)	hydrophilic monomer units derived from monomers having a 30      solubility of greater than 30 g/litre in water<br>
(distilled or equivalent) at 25°C, or<br><br>

-    7   -<br>
c)	any mixture of a)and b), or<br>
d)	a), b) or c) with other polymerisable monomers.<br>
By "monomer units" as used herein is meant the monomeric <br>
5  units of the polymer chain, thus references to "a polymer particle comprising hydrophobic monomer units" as used herein means that the polymer particle is derived from hydrophobic monomers, and so forth.<br>
10  Hydrophobic water insoluble monomer units<br>
The particle of the invention may comprise insoluble (i.e. very hydrophobic) latex monomers (by "insoluble" is meant that the material is not soluble in water (distilled or <br>
15  equivalent) at a concentration of 0.1 g/litre or above, at<br>
*<br>
25°C).  Examples include but are not limited to long chain hydrocarbon monoacrylates and methacrylates.  Preferably, the carbon chain length is greater than 10 carbon atoms, as for example in lauryl and stearyl methacrylates.<br>

25  30 g/litre, preferably greater than 35 g/litre, more<br>
preferably greater than 4 0 g/litre for example 4 0 to 45 g/litre in water (distilled or equivalent) at 25°C. Examples include but are not limited to methacrylic and acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylates and methacrylates,<br>
30  glycerol acrylates and methacrylates, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylates and acrylates, n-vinyl pyrrolidone, acryloyl<br><br>

morpholine, n-vinyl acetamide, vinyl caprolactone.  Such monomers may be utilised at levels of at least 10 % based on particle weight, preferably from 10 to 80 %, more preferably from 15 to 50 % and most preferably from 20 to 40 % by <br>
5  	weight of the particle.<br>
Polymerisable Monomers<br>
Particles of the invention may comprise a wide range of <br>
10	monomer units, i.e. the polymer may be derived from a wide range of monomers. The monomer is a monomer suitable for free radical aqueous mini emulsion polymerisation. Therefore, preferably the monomer contains at least one ethylenically unsaturated group capable of undergoing <br>
15  addition polymerisation.<br>
A mixture of monomers may be used.  The monomers of the mixture may be selected according to their solubilities. Preferably, the monomer mixture comprises monomers of low<br>
20  solubility and monomers of high solubility.<br>
By low solubility as used herein in reference to monomers, is meant that the material is soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration in the range of from 0.1 to<br>
25  30 g/litre, at 25°C.<br>
By high solubility as used herein in reference to monomers, is meant that the material is soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration of greater than <br>
30 g/litre, 30  at 25°C.<br><br>

Suitably, those monomers that are of low solubility preferably make up greater than 3 0 %, preferably 3 5 to 99 % of the mixture, by weight of the total monomer mixture, and those monomers of high solubility preferably make up less <br>
5 	 than 3 0 %, preferably 1 to 25 % of the mixture, by weight of the total monomer mixture.<br>
Examples of suitable monomers having low solubility as defined above include olefins, ethylene, vinylaromatic<br>
10  monomers such as divinyl benzene, styrene, a-methylstyrene, o- chlorostyrene or vinyltoluenes, esters of vinyl alcohol and monocarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl n-butyrate, vinyl laurate and vinyl stearate, esters of a, /3-monoethylenically unsaturated mono-<br>
15  and dicarboxylic acids, such as acrylic, methacrylic,<br>
maleic, fumaric and itaconic acid, with alcohols, such as methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, dimethyl or di-n-butyl maleate, nitriles of a,jS-monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as<br>
20  acrylonitrile, and conjugated dienes, such as 1,3-butadiene and isoprene.  Preferred monomers include vinyl acetate, methacrylate and styrene.  Most preferred monomers include methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.<br>
25<br>
Examples of suitable monomers having high solubility as defined above are a, /S-monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids and their amides, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
30  acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, poly<br>

-   10   -<br>
sulfonic acid and its water-soluble salts, and N-vinyl-pyrrolidone.<br>
Monomers which internally crosslink the emulsion droplets<br>
 5  may also be incorporated during the polymerisation.  Such crosslinkers have at least two non-conjugated ethylenically unsaturated double bonds.  Examples are alkylene glycol diacrylates and dimethacrylates such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-propylene<br>
10  glycol diacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4-butylene glycol diacrylates and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, and also<br>
15  divinylbenzene, vinyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate, allyl<br><br>
methacrylate, allyl acrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, methylenebisacrylamide, cyclopentadienyl acrylate, and triallyl cyanurate.  These monomers are copolymerised mostly in amounts of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on<br>
20  the total amount of monomers to be polymerised.<br>
The Benefit Agent<br>
The polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle (i.e. without <br>
25	additional benefit agent), if applied to the fabric during laundering, may provide one or more of the following benefits to the fabric: stiffening, starching, softening, drape modifying, lubricating, elastomeric, shape retention, crease reduction, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour <br>
30  preservation and anti-pilling, depending on the specific particle monomers utilised.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PC77EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
However, preferably, the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle contains an additional benefit agent when used in laundering.  When present,' this additional benefit agent is pre-mixed, preferably pre-dissolved in the monomers.  The <br>
5  presence of the additional benefit agent may enhance the benefit(s) conferred by the polymer particle itself (listed above) and/or confer further benefit(s).<br>
The benefit agent may be any agent that is capable of <br>
10 imparting desirable properties to the substrate it is applied to.  Preferably, the benefit agent is a fabric benefit agent.<br>
A fabric benefit agent is any suitable agent which affects <br>
15	the feel, appearance, or perception of a fabric.  The fabric benefit agent may be selected from, but is not limited to, the following: fabric softeners, lubricants, ease of ironing aids, stiffening agents, moisturising agents, shape retention aids, crease reduction agents, anti-pilling <br>
20  agents, colour preservatives, perfumes, drape modifiers,<br>
fluorescers, sunscreens, photofading inhibitors, fungicides and insect repellents.<br>
Suitable fabric softeners are amino functional silicone oils<br>
25  such as Rhodorsil Oil Extrasoft supplied by Rhodia<br>
Silicones.  Other silicones may be selected from those disclosed GB 1,549,180A, EP 459,821A2 and EP 459822A.  These silicones can also be used as lubricants.  Other suitable lubricants include any of those known for use as dye bath<br>
30  lubricants in the textile industry.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
The Polysaccharide<br>
The polysaccharide preferably has a 6-1,4-linked backbone. Preferably the polysaccharide is a cellulose, a cellulose <br>
5	derivative, or another P-1,4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as polymannan, polyglucan, polyglucomannan, polyxyloglucan and polygalactomannan.  More preferably, the polysaccharide is selected from the group consisting of polyxyloglucan and polygalactomannan.  For <br>
10  example, preferred polysaccharides are locust bean gum, tamarind xyloglucan, guar gum or mixtures thereof.  Most preferably, the polysaccharide is locust bean gum.<br>
The polysaccharide acts as a delivery aid/deposition agent 15  for the particle (and additional benefit agent if present).<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide backbone has only £-1,4 linkages.  Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the £-1,4 linkages, such as £-1,3 linkages.<br>
20  Thus, optionally some other linkages are present.<br>
Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).<br>
25<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are<br>
30  therefore not in themselves counted in determining the<br>
degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is present at levels of between 0.1% to 10% w/w by weight of the monomer, preferably 2% w/w by weight of monomer.<br>
5  Grafted Polysaccharide<br>
In the polymer particles of the invention, the polysaccharide is grafted to the polymer particle.  By grafted as used herein, in the context of the invention, is<br>
10  meant attached.  Attachment may be by means of a covalent bond, entanglement or strong adsorption, preferably by a covalent bond or entanglement and most preferably by means of a covalent bond.  By entanglement as used herein is meant that the polysaccharide is adsorbed onto the particle and<br>
15  part of the adsorbed polysaccharide is buried within the<br>
interior of the particle.  Hence, part of the polysaccharide is entrapped and bound in the particle polymer matrix, whilst the remainder is free to extend into the aqueous phase.<br>
20<br>
By strong adsorption as used herein is meant strong adsorption of the polysaccharide to the surface of the particle; such adsorption can, for example, occur due to hydrogen bonding, Van Der Waals or electrostatic attraction<br>
25  between the polysaccharide chains and the particle.<br>
The grafted polysaccharide is thus mainly attached to the particle surface and is not, to any significant extent, distributed throughout the internal bulk of the particle. <br>
30  This is distinct from graft copolymers in which a<br>
polysaccharide may be grafted along the length of a polymer<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
chain.  A particle which is formed from a graft copolymer would, therefore, contain polysaccharide throughout the internal bulk of the particle as well as on the particle surface.  Thus the particle of the invention can be thought <br>
5	of as a "hairy particle", which is different from a graft copolymer.  This feature of the invention provides significant cost reduction opportunities for the manufacturer as much less polysaccharide is required to achieve the same level of activity as systems which utilize<br>
10  polysaccharide copolymers.<br>
The Polysaccharide-grafted Particle<br>
When used in laundering, the polysaccharide-grafted polymer<br>
15	particle deposits onto the fabric, preferably cotton, at higher levels than non-polysaccharide particles.  The polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle may be used in the treatment of fabric, preferably cotton.  Such treatment may provide a stiffening, softening, drape modifying, <br>
20  lubricating, elastomeric, shape retention, crease reduction, ease of ironing, moisturising, colour preservation, anti-pilling benefit to the fabric dependent on particle monomers utilised.<br>
25  When additional benefit agents are used, either additional properties depending on the benefit agent used will be imparted to the fabric, and/or the benefits conferred by the particle itself will be enhanced.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
Alternatively, the polysaccharide-grafted polymer particle may be incorporated into a laundry treatment composition and used in the treatment of fabric, preferably cotton.<br>
5	The polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles produced according to the present invention may also be used as stiffening finishes or drape modifiers for the textile finishing industry, as binders for paper and card production, as performance enhancers for wood and paper <br>
10  adhesives and as self-priming agents for wood paints.  Thus, applications other than in the fabric care field are contemplated by the present invention.<br>
As mentioned above, the particles of the invention may be <br>
15  thought of as "hairy particles".  The term "hairy particles" is known in the art and is generally defined as particles with attached polymer chains such that part of the polymer is attached or buried in the particle matrix and the remainder of the polymer is free to extend into the<br>
20  surrounding water phase.<br>
The Process for Preparation<br>
The particles of the invention can be prepared by a process 25  that comprises miniemulsion.<br>
Miniemulsion polymerisation is well known in the art and.the term "miniemulsion polymerisation" as used herein means the same as the term known in the art.  Numerous scientific<br>
30  reviews of miniemulsion techniques have been published:<br><br>

Miniemulsions generally lie in between macroemulsion and microemulsions in terms of droplet size and emulsion <br>
15  stability.  Miniemulsion droplets typically range in size<br><br>
from 50 to 500 nm.  The emulsion can be stable for as little as a few days or for as long as a month.  The droplets may be stabilised by the addition of an ionic surfactant (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate) and a cosurfactant.  The latter <br>
20  usually consists of either a long chain alkane (e.g.<br>
hexadecane) or an alcohol (e.g. hexadecanol).  The function of the cosurfactant is twofold; it acts in combination with the surfactant to create a barrier to droplet/droplet coalescence by arranging at the oil-water interface and it<br>
25  also limits diffusion of the oil phase from smaller to<br>
larger droplets by virtue of its low water solubility.<br>
Miniemulsions are typically formed by subjecting an oil (monomer), water, surfactant and cosurfactant system to high<br>
30  shear fields created by devices such as ultrasonifiers,<br>
homogenisers and microfluidisers.  These devices rely on<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   17   -<br>
mechanical shear and/or cavitation to break the oil phase into submicron size droplets.  When monomer is used as the oil phase, free radical polymerisation can subsequently be carried out by the addition of an initiator (e.g. ammonium<br>
 5  persulphate).  Such a process in which the miniemulsion<br>
droplets are converted to polymer particles is referred to as miniemulsion polymerisation.  For the sake of clarity, by "miniemulsion droplet or emulsion droplet" as used herein is meant the miniemulsion droplet before it is polymerised, and <br>
10  "emulsion particles" means the polymerised miniemulsion droplets.<br>
In conventional emulsion polymerisation the monomer diffuses through the aqueous phase to the surfactant formed micelles. <br>
15  Particle nucleation begins and proceeds in these micelles and the monomer droplets merely act as a reservoir of monomer.  Whereas in miniemulsion polymerisation the presence of cosurfactant and the use of high shear results in the formation of small monomer droplets.  These droplets<br>
20 	 are polymerised directly and no monomer diffusion to<br>
micelles occurs and no particle formation occurs within micelles.  Such differences are well documented in the literature for example in "Emulsion Polymerisation and Emulsion Polymers",   Edited by P.A.   Lovell  and M.S.   El-<br>
25 	Aasser,   John Wiley and Sons,   Chapter 20,  page  700-703.<br>
In conventional emulsion polymerisation, the benefit agent can only be incorporated at relatively low levels (typically 10 % or less by weight of the particle) and must be<br>
30  sparingly water soluble, have low molecular weight<br>
(typically under 1,000 g) and have similar water solubility<br><br>
WO 2005/121187<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005390<br><br>
-   18<br>
	and diffusion rate as the monomer.  However, for the miniemulsion polymerisation, none of these restraints apply. This allows the incorporation of higher levels (typically from 10 to 60 %) and a wider variety of benefit agents, such<br>
 5 	 as completely water insoluble and polymeric benefit agents (e.g. silicone resins and thermoplastic elastomers), in polymer particles, which cannot be achieved using conventional emulsion polymerisation techniques.<br>
10  The process for preparing particles of the invention comprises miniemulsion polymerisation. Preferably, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) preparation of a miniemulsion, and 15  (b) polymerisation of the miniemulsion of step (a),<br>
wherein grafting of the polysaccharide to the polymer particles occurs in step (b).<br>
Step (a) may consist of the following sub-steps:<br>
20<br>
(i)   monomers are mixed with a cosurfactant to form a<br>
mixture (y), (ii)   a polysaccharide and a surfactant are dissolved in water to form a mixture (z) , <br>
25  (iii) (y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear to form an emulsion, (iv)   the emulsion of step (iii) is then subjected to<br>
further shear (such as sonication or other suitable high pressure homogeniser such as a Microfluidiser or <br>
30 a Manton Gaulin homogeniser) to form a miniemulsion.<br><br>
WO 2005/121187	PCT/EP2005/005390<br>
-   19   -<br>
Preferably, an initiator is added to the miniemulsion (during step (b)) such that polymerisation of the monomers (and simultaneous grafting of the polysaccharide onto the polymer particles) proceeds.<br>
5<br>
A preferred process comprises the steps of:<br>
(i)   monomers are mixed with a cosurfactant to form a<br>
10<br>
mixture (y) , (ii)   a polysaccharide and a surfactant are   dissolved in<br>
water to form a mixture (z), (iii) (y) and (z) are combined and subjected to high shear<br>
15<br>
to form a miniemulsion and (iv)   an initiator is added such that polymerisation (and<br>
simultaneous grafting of the polysaccharide onto the<br>
polymer particles) proceeds.<br>
The resulting polymer particles preferably have a particle size of less than 1 micron, more preferably of less than 500<br>
20  nm.<br>
High Shear as used herein is applied using any suitable apparatus such as an ultrasound sonicator, microfluidizer or homogenizer.  High Shear as used in step (iv) above is <br>
25  defined as shear of sufficiently high intensity that the<br>
emulsion of step (iii) above is reduced in particle size to sub-micron dimensions, preferably under 500 nm.  Suitably, the emulsion of step (iv) is formed using a high shear homogeniser at 10,000 to 24,000 rpm for approximately 30<br>
30  seconds to 5 minutes and then sonified using a probe<br>
ultrasound sonicator (at maximum power output) for 10<br><br>

minutes to generate the miniemulsion.  A suitable homogeniser is a Manton Gaulin homogeniser or any other make of high shear homogenizer such as an Ultra Turrax.<br>
5  Suitable cosurfactants for use in the present invention include hexadecane, cetyl alcohol, lauroyl peroxide, n-dodecyl mercaptan, dodecyl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The preferred cosurfactant comprises hexadecane.<br>
10<br>
Initiators and chain transfer agents may also be present. Those skilled in the art will recognise that a chemical initiator will generally be required but that there are instances in which alternative forms of initiation will be<br>
15  possible, e.g. ultrasonic initiation or initiation by irradiation.<br>
The initiator is preferably a chemical or chemicals capable of forming free radicals in an aqueous environment. <br>
20  Typically, free radicals can be formed either by homolytic scission (i.e. homolysis) of a single bond or by single electron transfer to or from an ion or molecule (e.g. redox reactions).<br>
25  Suitably, in context of the invention, homolysis may be<br>
achieved by the application of heat (typically in the range of from 50 to 100°C).  Some examples of suitable initiators in this class are those possessing peroxide (-0-0-) or azo (-N=N-) groups, such as benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide,<br>
30  hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile and ammonium<br>
persulphate.  Homolysis may also be achieved by the action<br><br>

of radiation (usually ultraviolet), in which case it is, termed photolysis.  Examples are' the dissociation of 2,2'-azobis (2-cyanopropane) and the formation of free radicals from benzophenone and benzoin. <br>
5<br>
Redox reactions can also be used to generate free radicals. In this case an oxidising agent is paired with a reducing agent which then undergo a redox reaction.  Some examples of appropriate pairs in the context of the invention are <br>
10  ammonium persulphate/sodium metabisulphite, cumyl<br>
hydroperoxide/ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide/ ascorbic acid.<br>
Preferred initiators are be selected from the following:<br>
15  Homolytic: benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, ammonium persulphate, 2,2'-azobis (cyanopropane), benzophenone, benzoin, Redox: ammonium persulphate/sodium metabisulphite mixture, cumyl hydroperoxide/ferrous ion mixture and/or hydrogen<br>
20  peroxide/asorbic acid mixture.  The preferred initiator is ammonium persulphate.  The preferred level of initiator is in the range of from 0.1 to 5.0 % w/w by weight of monomer, more preferably, the level is in the range of from 1.0 to 3.0 % w/w by weight of monomer.<br>
25<br>
Chain transfer agents can optionally be used to reduce the degree of polymerisation and hence the final molecular weight of the polymer.  A chain transfer agent contains very labile hydrogen atoms that are easily abstracted by a<br>
30  propagating polymer chain.  This terminates the<br>
polymerisation of the growing polymer, but generates a new<br><br>

5	and can be represented by the general chemical formula RS-H, such as n-dodecyl mercaptan and 2-mercaptoethanol.  The preferred chain transfer agent is monothioglycerol, used at levels of, preferably from 0 to 5 % w/w based on the weight of the monomer and more preferably at a level of 0.25 % w/w<br>

In the following examples where percentages are mentioned, this is to be understood as percentage by weight.<br>
10  Example 1: Preparation of Locust Bean Gum- grafted polymer particles by miniemulsion polymerisation<br>
Polysaccharide-grafted polymer particles PI were prepared as follows .-<br>
15<br>
Locust Bean Gum (LBG) (2 g) was added to demineralised water (369.5 g) with pH adjustment to 2.5 (via the addition of 1M HCl) and homogenised using a Silverson homogeniser at 10,000 rpm for 2 min.  The resulting LBG solution was then heated<br>
20  using an isomantle to 70°C before being thoroughly mixed at 10,000 rpm for 1 hour.  Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) (1.5 g) was then added to the LBG solution and allowed to dissolve.<br>
25  Methyl Methacrylate (80 g), Methacrylic Acid (20 g),<br>
Ethylene Glycol dimethacrylate (1 g) and a cosurfactant Hexadecane (2 g) were added to a 1 litre reaction vessel. The LBG solution previously prepared was then added to the reaction vessel and the components mixed using a high shear<br>
30  homogeniser at 10,000 rpm for 5 min.  The resulting emulsion was then sonicated on full power for 15 min, to form the<br><br>

miniemulsion, with the reaction vessel submerged in ice to prevent the reactants in the reaction vessel from reaching boiling point.<br>
5  A five-necked lid which was fitted with a stirrer paddle,<br>
thermometer, nitrogen purge and condenser was secured to the reaction vessel.<br>
The miniemulsion was heated in an isomantle to 65°C with<br>
10	stirring at 300 rpm and purging with nitrogen.  When at 65°C, the nitrogen purge was removed from solution but nitrogen was still allowed to flow over the surface of the reactants. An initiator solution was added to the reaction vessel to start the polymerisation.  The initiator solution comprised <br>
15  ammonium persulphate (1.5 g) in deionised water (5 g).<br>
Shortly after the addition of the initiator solution, an exotherm was observed that elevated the reactant temperature to -80°C.<br>
20<br>
After the exotherm had completed (-2 0 min) an extra amount of SDS (2.5 g in 15 g demineralised water) was added to the reactants to provide additional stabilisation against coagulation.<br>
25<br>
The reactants were allowed to react for a total of 2 hours from the addition of initiator before the products were cooled to room temperature and filtered through 40 Denier nylon mesh.  The total solids content was found to be -2 0%<br>
30  (by drying to constant weight in an oven).  The solids were the particles comprising poly[(methyl methacrylate(80%)-co-<br><br>

10  Example 2: Wash Deposition of Pi and Comparative Example A onto cotton<br>
Using a UV-visible Spectrophotometer a linear calibration plot for absorbance at 4 00 nm versus concentration of LBG<br>
15  grafted co-polymer particle was found to exist for polymer particle concentrations below 800 ppm.  A similar trend was observed Comparative Example A.  These calibration plots were then used to determine the amount of polymer particles that deposits onto cotton in a simulated wash process.<br>

Preparation of the wash liquor:<br>
Base Buffer Stock (12.5 ml) and surfactant stock (12.5 ml) were added to a high density poly(ethylene) wash bottle of 150 ml capacity and 100 ml de-ionised water was added to<br>
 5  produce a Wash liquor buffered at pH 10.5 and containing 1 g/L surfactant (50:50 LAS:A7).<br>
Simulated wash:<br>
0.5 g of polymer particles, PI or Comparative Example A,<br>
10  (800 ppm of particles based on wash liquor) was added to the wash liquor and the Absorbance produced at 400 nm recorded through a 1 cm cuvette.  The value ABS400nm was used to determine, by interpolation of the calibration plot, the amount of polymer particles in the wash liquor prior to the<br>
15  simulated wash process.<br><br>
A section of unfluoresced cotton measuring 20 cm by 20 cm was placed into the wash bottle containing the wash liquor and polymer particles and the bottle was sealed. The wash <br>
20	bottle was then placed into a shaker bath, thermostated at 40°C, for 1 hour to simulate a wash process. After 1 hour the cloth was removed from the wash bottle, wrung out, and the ABS400nm recorded of the wash liquor and the concentration of polymer particles in solution determined by<br>
25  interpolation of the calibration plot.  The wash process was<br>
carried out in triplicate.<br>

Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) was used to characterise the swelling behaviour of the LBG-grafted polymer particles.  The influence of change in solution pH <br>
15  and added electrolyte was investigated.<br>
LBG-grafted polymer particles, PI, (not exceeding 0.08 %) were dissolved in the following: de-mineralised water, 0.1 M NaCl and surfactant solutions at pH 6.5 and surfactant <br>
20  solution at pH 10.5.<br>
Solution pH was altered by addition of either dilute HCl or NaOH.<br>
