				<td>The present invention relates to gas drying assembly housing, gas drying canister housing and regenerative gas dryer system.<br>
The present invention on generally relates to a system for drying air supplied by a compressor unit for use in a pneumatic system.   More particularly, the present invention relates to a regenerative air dryer system which alternately switches between removing moisture from air to be used by the pneumatic system by passing it through a first drying assembly while purging previously collected moisture from a second drying assembly and removing moisture from air to be used by the pneumatic system by passing it through  the  second  drying  assembly  while  purging  previously collected moisture from the first drying assembly.   Still more particularly,  the  present  invention  pertains  to  a  desiccant canister assembly housing which features a mechanism for aligning and securably retaining a desiccant canister within the desiccant canister assembly housing of an air dryer system. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that air dryer systems are designed to remove moisture vapor from a stream of compressed air into which the air dryer system is incorporated. In practice, an air dryer system employs one or more standard air drying assemblies each of which contains a moisture absorbing material to absorb the moisture from the air. In air dryer systems having one air drying assembly, the air drying assembly through its moisture absorbing material absorbs the moisture suspended in the compressed air passing through it until the compressor stops operating after a preset time. By design, this type of air dryer system then automatically flushes a quantity of the dried compressed air stored in a purge volume back through the moisture absorbing material to draw out the absorbed moisture. The stream of compressed air with the revaporized moisture it carries is then discharged to the atmosphere thereby regenerating the moisture absorbing material contained in the air drying assembly.<br>
In air dryer systems having two air drying assemblies, the air drying system alternately cycles between removing moisture from air passing through a first drying assembly while purging from a second drying assembly moisture previously collected therein and removing moisture from air passing through the second drying assembly while purging from the first drying assembly moisture previously collected therein.<br>
Prior to the present invention, such prior art air dryer systems generally have used the standard air drying assembly to<br>
perform the air drying function. Whether the air dryer system employs one or more standard air drying assemblies, each standard air drying assembly inserts into a housing designed to hold same. The prior art housings, however, generally retain the standard air drying assembly through a tight press fitting, or in other terms, interference fitting of the assembly within the housing-Specifically, the fit of the standard air drying assembly into its corresponding housing in the air dryer system is so tight that it typically must be hammered into the housing with a mallet or like instrument.<br>
The standard air drying assembly and corresponding housing design thus present a number of shortcomings. First, the process of installing the standard air drying assembly into the housing is quite strenuous and takes too much time. Second, one can not be sure whether the standard air drying assembly is properly aligned within the housing so that the top of the assembly seats against and makes an air tight seal with a sealing face of the housing. Third, removal of the standard air drying assembly from the housing is often quite difficult because of its tight fit within the housing. For these reasons, a regenerative air dryer system inclusive of a novel air drying assembly housing that does not exhibit the disadvantages outlined above is described and claimed herein as follows.<br>
The present regenerative air dryer system can be applied to a wide variety of pneumatic systems-  Typical of the types of<br>
pneumatic systems to which the instant system could be applied<br>
include the pneumatic brake systems of passenger transit and freight railroad trains, subway trains and various other types of rail related transportation systems. Further examples include the pneumatic brake systems of various truck transport vehicles. Other types of pneumatic systems to which the present system could be applied may indeed be found outside the transportation field.<br>
It should be noted that the foregoing background information is provided to assist the reader in understanding the instant invention. Accordingly, any terms of art used herein are not intended to be limited to any particular narrow interpretation unless specifically stated otherwise in this document.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an air drying canister housing for a desiccant canister in an air dryer system. The canister housing includes a main portion having an upper base and a lower portion having a lower base. A canister bore is defined between the upper and lower bases when the main and lower portions are fastened to each other. The main portion defines a supply port through which a stream of moisture-bearing air is directed into the housing for passage through the desiccant canister during drying mode of operation. The main portion also defines a delivery port through which a stream of dried air is directed from the housing during the drying mode. The lower portion defines a purge port through the lower base through which a stream of remoisturized,air is expelled from the housing during a purge mode of operation of the air dryer<br>
system. The upper base of the main portion features a sealing flange against which an outer rim portion of a top of the desiccant canister is seatable so as to make an air tight seal therebetween. The air drying canister housing further includes a mechanism for aligning and securably retaining the desiccant canister within the housing such that when the desiccant canister is so aligned and securably retained the top of the desiccant canister aligns with and seals against the sealing flange and communication between the supply and delivery ports of the housing is possible only through the desiccant canister.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, one of the primary objects of the present invention to provide a novel desiccant canister housing assembly for an air dryer system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel housing assembly for a desiccant canister within an air dryer system wherein the housing assembly includes a mechanism for aligning and securably retaining the desiccant canister within the housing assembly.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel housing assembly for a desiccant cainster within an air dryer system wherein the housing assembly features a threaded rod extending from a center of an upper base of the housing assembly for insertion through a positioning bore defined through a center of the desiccant canister so as to securably retain the desiccant canister about the threaded rod with a securing means so that a top<br>
of the desiccant canister aligns with and seals against a sealing flange of the housing assembly.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel housing assembly for a desiccant canister within an air dryer system wherein the ' desiccant canister easily installs into and removes from the housiny assembly as compared to prior art housing assemblies and their corresponding desiccant canisters.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before describing the present invention in detail, for the sake of clarity and understanding, the reader is advised that identical components having identical functions in each of the accompanying drawings have been marked with the same reference numerals throughout each of the several Figures illustrated herein.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the essential details of a<br>
desiccant canister housing assembly of an air dryer system. The<br>
desiccant canister housing assembly may be used to house any one of<br>
a variety of desiccant canisters having the basic structural<br>
characteristics shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows a regenerative<br>
air dryer system that has two of the desiccant canister housing<br>
assemblies shown in Figure 1. It is a desiccant canister having<br>
the basic structural characteristics shown in Figure 2 that the<br>
canister housing assembly of the present invention is primarily<br>
designed to retain. One such desiccant canister is featured in one<br>
of the aforement documents previously incorporated herein by<br>
reference.	<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, the desiccant canister housing assembly, generally designated 200, includes a main portion 210 and a lower portion 220. Main portion 210 has an upper base 202 and lower portion 220 has a lower base 222. A main bore extends from upper base 202 of main portion 210 and a lower<br>
bore extends from lower base 222 of lower portion 220. A canister bore 215 is defined between the upper and lower bases when main portion 210 is fastened to lower portion 220. It is within this canister bore 215 that the aforementioned desiccant canister 100 is to be housed as shown in Figure 2•<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, main portion 210 defines a supply port, generally designated 230, through which a stream of moisture-bearing air is directed into housing assembly 200 for passage through the desiccant canister 100 to remove the moisture from the incoming stream of air. The moisture is absorbed by the desiccant canister housed within housing assembly 200 when housing assembly 200 is operated in a drying mode of operation by the air  dryer system as is well known in the technical field pertaining to  air drying. Main portion 210 also defines a delivery port, generally designated 240, through which a stream of dried air is directed from housing assembly 200 during the drying mode. Lower portion 220 defines a purge port 250 through its lower base 222 through which a stream of remoisturized gas is expelled from housing assembly 200, The moisture is expelled from housing assembly 200 when housing assembly 200 is operated in a purge mode of operation by the air dryer system as is well known in the air drying art.<br>
Main portion 210 on its upper base 202 also features a sealing flange 201 as shown in Figures 1 and 2. As explained further below, sealing flange 201 is the seat which a corresponding top of the desiccant canister 100 aligns with and preferably seals<br>
against so as to make an air tight seal between the desiccant canister 100 and housing assembly 200.<br>
The desiccant canister housing assembly 200 also includes a means, generally designated 260, for aligning and securably retaining the desiccant canister within canister bore 215. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the means for aligning and securably retaining 260 includes a threaded rod 203 extending from a center of upper base 202 into lower portion 220. The threaded rod 203 is for inserting through a positioning bore defined through a center of the desiccant canister 100, The desiccant canister 100 securably retains about threaded rod 203 via a securing means 204 such as a lock washer 205 and a stop nut 206, as best shown in Figure 2. Through securing means 204, the means for aligning and retaining 260 retains the desiccant canister 100 so that the top of the desiccant canister 100 aligns with and seals against sealing flange 201 of main portion 210.<br>
The sealing flange 201 is preferably designed to seal against a desiccant canister that has an outer ring portion at its top- As shown in Figure 2, the outer ring portion 110 preferably includes a groove 111 within which an o-ring 112 retains. Through o~ring 112, the outer ring portion 110 seats against and makes an air tight seal with sealing flange 201- It is through this means for aligning and securably retaining 260 that sealing flange 201 of canister housing assembly 200 aligns with and seals against the top of the desiccant canister 100. When the desiccant canister 100 and sealing flange 201 are seated against one another, communication<br>
between supply port 230 and delivery port 240 is possible only through the desiccant canister 100 as is  best shown in Figure 2.<br>
Referring now to a Figure 4 a egenerative air dryer system, generally designated 300, includes two desiccant canister housing assemblies 200a and 200b of the type illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The regenerative air dryer system 300 installs within a pneumatic system to clean and dry a stream of unpurified air received from source of pressurized air. The air dryer system 300 includes an inlet manifold 310, a coalescing filter chamber 320, a first desiccant canister housing assembly 200a, a second canister assembly housing 200b, an inlet check valve means 330, an outlet manifold 340, an outlet check valve means 350, a purge valve means 360 and controlling means 370,<br>
The inlet manifold 310 defines a supply passage 311 for receiving the stream of unpurified air from the source of pressurized air (not shown). The inlet manifold 310 also defines first and second delivery passages, generally designated 312a and<br>
312b, respectively. Similarly, the outlet manifold 340 defines a first supply passage and a second supply passage, generally designated 341a and 341b, respectively. Supply passage 341a connects to delivery port 240a of first housing assembly 200a as best shown in Figures 1 and 3. Similarly, supply passage 341b connects to delivery port 240b of second housing assembly 200b. The outlet manifold 340 also defines a delivery passage 342 through which a stream of cleaned and dried air is delivered to the pneumatic system (not shown).<br>
The coalescing filter chamber 320 initially separates moisture and other particulates from the stream of unpurified air received from supply passage 311 of inlet manifold 310 and delivers a stream of initially filtered air to the delivery passages 312a and 312b of inlet manifold 310. The filter contained within the coalescing chamber 310 is preferably a borosilicate filter-<br>
The inlet check valve means 330 affects flow from first 312a and second 312b delivery passages of inlet manifold 310 to first 200a and second 200b housing assemblies, respectively. The inlet check valve means 330 includes first and second normally open inlet check valves 330a and 330b. First inlet check valve 330a affects flow between first delivery passage 312a of inlet manifold 310 and supply port 230a of first housing assembly 200a as is best shown in Figures l and 3. Similarly, second inlet check valve 330b affects flow between second delivery passage 312b of inlet manifold 310 and supply port 230b of second housing assembly 200b.<br>
The outlet check valve means 350 affects flow from first 341a and second 341b supply passages of outlet manifold 340 to delivery passage 342 of outlet manifold 340. The outlet check valve means 350 includes first and second normally open outlet check valves 350a and 350b. First outlet check valve 350a affects flow between first supply passage 341a of outlet manifold 340 and delivery passage 342 of outlet manifold 340. Similarly, second outlet check valve 350b affects flow between second supply passage 341b of outlet manifold 340 and delivery passage 342 of outlet manifold 340.<br>
The purge valve means 360 is a device through which moisture previously collected in first 200a and second 200b housing assemblies is expelled to atmosphere. The purge valve means includes first and second normally closed purge valves 360a and 360b. First purge valve 360a connects to purge port 250a defined through the lower base of first housing assembly 200a as is best shown in Figures 1 and 3. Similarly, second purge valve 360b connects to purge port 2 5 Ob defined through the lower base of second housing assembly 200b. The regenerative gas dryer system/ 300 also provides a drain valve means, generally designated 380. The drain valve means 380 includes a normally closed double seated drain valve 381 at the bottom of coalescing filter chamber 320.<br>
The controlling means 370 generally coordinates operation of all of the valve means of the air dryer system 300 according to a preset operating cycle. During a first half of the preset cycle, the valves of the air dryer system 300 are set so that first desiccant canister housing 200a removes moisture from the streeun of initially filtered air while second desiccant canister housing 200b is purged of moisture it has previously collected. Specifically, first inlet check valve 330a and first outlet check valve 350a are open and first purge valve 360a is closed while second inlet check valve 330b and second outlet check valve 350b are closed and second purge valve 360b is open. The regenerative air dryer system 300 then generally operates as follows. The stream of initially filtered air flows from coalescing chamber 320 into first 312a and second 312b delivery passages of inlet manifold 310. Because first<br>
and second inlet valves 330a and 330b are open and closed, respectively, the stream of initially filtered air flows only into first housing assembly 200a through its supply port 230a as shown in Figures 1 and 3. First desiccant housing 200a extracts moisture from the stream of initially filtered air. From first housing assembly 200a flows a first stream of purified air to a choke valve means, generally designated 390, located between main portions 210a and 210b. Choke valve means 390 directs the first stream of purified air in an output percentage to the pneumatic system and in a purge percentage to second housing assembly 200b. The purge percentage of the first stream of purified air flows through second housing assembly 200b thereby reabsorbing the moisture previously contained within its desiccant canister. This remoisturized air stream then flows through purge port 250b and purge valve 360b to atmosphere thereby regenerating second housing assembly 200b for a second half of the preset cycle. Meanwhile, the output percentage of the first stream of purified air flows through delivery port 240a of first housing assembly 200a into first supply port 341a of outlet manifold 340. Because first outlet check valve 350a is open, the output percentage of the first stream of purified air flows through first supply 341a and delivery 342 passages of outlet manifold 340 into the pneumatic system.<br>
During the second half of the preset cycle, the valves of the air dryer system 300 are set so that second desiccant canister housing 200b removes moisture from the stream of initially filtered air while first desiccant canister housing 200a is purged of<br>
moisture it has previously collected. Specifically, second inlet check valve 330b and second outlet check valve 350b are open and second purge valve 360b is closed while first inlet check valve 330a and first outlet check valve 350a are closed and first purge valve 360a is open. The regenerative air dryer system 300 then generally operates as follows. The stream of initially filtered air flows from coalescing chamber 320 into first 312a and second 312b delivery passages of inlet manifold 310. Because first and second inlet valves 330a and 330b are closed and open, respectively, the stream of initially filtered air flows,only into second housing assembly 200b through its supply port 230b as shown in Figures 1 and 3. Second desiccant housing 20Ob extracts moisture from the stream of initially filtered air. From second housing assembly 200b flows a second stream of purified air to choke valve means 390 located between main portions 210a and 210b. Choke valve means 390 directs the second stream of purified air in an output percentage to the pneumatic system and in a purge percentage to first housing assembly 200a. The purge percentage of the second stream of purified air flows through first housing assembly 200a thereby reabsorbing the moisture previously contained within its desiccant canister. This remoisturized air streeun then flows through purge port 250a and purge valve 360a to atmosphere thereby regenerating first housing assembly 200a for the first half of the preset cycle. Meanwhile, the output percentage of the second stream of purified air flows through delivery port 240b of second housing assembly 200b into second supply port 341b of outlet<br>
manifold 340. Because second outlet check valve 350b is open, the output percentage of the second stream of purified air flows through second supply 341b and delivery 342 passages of outlet manifold 310 into the pneumatic system.<br>
The controlling means 370 thus controls the operation of all the valve means so that the air dryer system 300 alternates between the first and second halves of the preset operating cycle. Preferably, the preset operating cycle lasts two minutes with one minute allocated for each half cycle. The controlling means 370 also controls drain valve 381 situated at the bottom of coalescing filter chamber 320 so that drain valve 381 opens briefly as the air dryer system 300 switches between the first and second halves of the preset cycle. This permits moisture previously collected in coalescing chamber 320 to be expelled to atmosphere.<br>
The controlling means 370 includes a first actuating device, a second actuating device and an electronic controller for controlling operation of the actuating devices. The first actuating device controls operation of first inlet check valve 330a, first outlet check valve 350a, first purge valve 360a and drain valve 381. The second actuating device controls operation of second inlet check valve 330b, second outlet check valve 350b, second purge valve 360b and drain valve 381. In the presently preferred embodiment of the air dryer system, it is preferred that each of the valves be of the air piloted variety. Consequently, first actuating device is preferably a normally closed three way solenoid valve for controlling supply of pilot air to the valves<br>
under its control. Likewise, second actuating device is preferably a normally closed three way solenoid valve for controlling supply of pilot air to the valves under its control. The electronic controller includes within its electronic circuitry a timer circuit through which to control the switching between the first and second halves of the preset operating cycle.<br>
The regenerative gas dryer system 300 further includes a pressure sensor for sensing the pressure within the air dryer system 300. When the pressure falls below a predetermined level, the controlTing means 370 allows all the valves to assume their respective normally open or closed states. This will allow the maximum amount of air to pass through the air dryer system 300 thereby reducing the time required to charge the pneumatic system in which the air dryer system 300 is incorporated. Conversely, when the pressure reaches or exceeds the predetermined level, the controlling means 370 operates the air dryer system 300 according to the preset operating cycle. The controlling means 370 will generally not operate the air dryer system 300 according to the preset operating cycle unless the pressure is generally equal to or exceeds the predetermined level and the source of compressed air is loaded.<br>
The controlling means 370 also includes a memory circuit. When the source of compressed air is not loaded, the controlling means 370 receives a signal that activates the memory circuit. Through the memory circuit, equal drying and purging times can be assured for each of the first and second housing assemblies 200a<br>
and 200b. Specifically, the memory circuit remembers the point within the preset operating cycle when the source of compressed air becomes unloaded. The next time that the source becomes loaded, the signal ceases and the air dryer system 300 resumes operation at the point in the preset operating cycle at which it last operated.<br>
The controlling means 370 also includes a power shut off feature. When the supply of power to the controlling means 370 is cut off, the controlling means 370 will start at the beginning of the preset operating cycle when power is restored. This permits both the first and second desiccant canister housing assemblies 200a and 200b to perform a complete cycle upon start-up.<br>
While the presently preferred embodiments of the canister housing assembly invention and the air dryer system incorporating same have been set forth in detail according to the Patent Act, those persons of ordinary skill in the technical art to which this invention pertains will recognize various alternative ways of practicing the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will also recognize that the foregoing description is merely illustrative and is not intended to limit any of the following claims to any particular narrow interpretation.<br>
