The present invention relates to a process for preparing loratadine, a medicinal product with antihistamine activity. Loratadme is ethyl 4-(8-chloro-5,6-dihydro-l 1H-ben2»[5,qcyclohep^l^b]pyridin-U-yUdenB)-l^iperidinecarbOTyl^ (Jhe Merck Index, 1201 ed., 5608, p. 953). More specifically, the invention relates to a process for synthesizing loratadine from a novel intermediate, 2-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-Yl)-3-methylpyridine.<br>
Loratadine was described for the first time in Schcring patent US 4 282 233. hi the said patent, the synthesis of loratadine is described starting with 8-chloro-ll-(l-metfaylpiperid-4-ylidene)^,n4ihydro-5H-benzo[5,6]cvcloheptaj;i^-b]pyridine a), which reacts with ethyl chloroformate in benzene. Scheme 1 illustrates the reaction.<br><br><br>
Schering patent US 4.731.447 describes the synthesis of compound a) from compound b), the latter compound being obtained from 3-mcthyl-2-cyanopvridme in four steps. Compound b) gives compound a) by cychzation with a superacid having a Hammett acidity constant lower than -12. Patent US 4.731.447 in turn describes the synthesis of compound c) from 3-[2
However, given meir chemical corrosiveness, superacids are problematic to use industrially. The synthesis of a) from compound c) is described in Schering patent US 4.659.716. a) is obtained by reacting compound c) with the Qrignard reagent of 4-chloro-N-methylpiperidine, to give 8-cMoro-n<l-mefcyl-rmperigm which by subsequent dehydration gives a another process mat involves starting with compound c and obtaining loratadine without proceeding vis ia described in schering patent application wo mis case the synthesis proceeds via wittig reaction between phosphorus ytide generates an unstable intermediate. on account of its instability intermediate needs to be stabilized adding protonating agent or acetic acid only thereafter thermal decomposition it can give loratadine. however as said product is not pure form but purified several times distillation finally recrystallized remove impurities solvent phosphorus-containiiig compounds. thus addition being laborious this also losses product. syntheses hitherto therefore involve various drawbacks including large number stepa use reagents that are difficult handle at industrial level formation unwanted side-reaction products reactions purify reduce yields.></l-mefcyl-rmperigm>
Surprisingly, a process that represents one of the aspects of the present invention has now been found, this process making it possible to synthesize loratadine from 2-3-nwthylpvridine of formula L<br><br><br>
Compound m, along with compound VI which may be present, is then converted under hydrolyric conditions into the intermediate b) and finally from the said intermediate into loratadine by known methods.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 2 compares the process that is the object of the present invention with the processes<br>
described by Sobering, indicated by the abbreviations Z, SI and S2, respectively.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention is represented by the novel compounds of formulae<br>
I, D and m and their use for the preparation of loratadine.<br>
A third aspect is represented by a process for obtaining the intermediate b) from compound<br>
I, which, by treatment with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at 0°C and then with<br>
3-chlorobenzyl chloride, gives compound U. Subsequent treatment of compound II with the<br>
Grignard reagent of 4-chloro-N-methyIpiperidiiic produces compound IH, which, on<br>
hydrolysis, gives the intermediate b).<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention is represented by an alternative method, relative to processes<br>
SI and S2 of scheme 2, for obtaining the intermediate c) from compound D, which is<br>
hydrolysed to give 3-[2^3^h]orophenyl)ethyl]-pyridhic-2-carboxylio acid of formula IV.<br><br>
The acid function of compound IV is converted into the corresponding acid chloride and<br>
then coupled via a Friedel-Crafts reaction to give the intermediate c).<br>
A fifth aspect of the present invention is a process for synthesizing loratadine by preparation<br>
of compound n to give c) according to the process described above, followed by conversion<br>
ofc)mtolorataxhOTaccorinngtoJaownteclmi(jues.<br>
A  preferred embodiment of the  invention consists in  using  2-(4l4-dhnerhyl-4,S~<br>
dihydrooxaOTl-2-yl)-3-me%h^dme of formula I as starting compound.<br>
Obviously, the use of oxazoEne analogues such as the 4-methyl-, 4,4-diethyl- or<br>
4-ethyfoxazoline, bearing the same substituent in position 2, fall within the spirit of the<br>
present invention. The choice of the 4,4-dimeQiylQj[8zoline {compound I) is based solely on<br>
criteria of process economics.<br>
The route that has been found to be the most advantageous for obtaining compound I is that<br><br>
described in the article by Fryzuk M. D., Jafarpour L. and Rettig S. J., Tetrahedron; Asymmetry, 1998, 9, 3191. The experimental conditions for obtaining 2-(4,4-dimethy]-4,S-dthydrooxa2ol-2-yl)-3-metJiylpyridme were drawn from this article. The latter compound is obtained by reaction between 2-cyano-3-methylpyridine and l.l-dimethylaaninoethanol, using anhydrous ZnCl) as catalyst at 140°C for 15 hours, in the absence of solvent. Compound I thus obtained was reacted with 3-chlorobenzyl chloride or an analogue thereof (gee scheme 3) in the presence of a strong base, preferably lithium diisopropylanride (IDA). The reaction was performed in an inert solvent (THF, toluene, diethyl ether or hexane); tetrahydrofiiran (THF) and a temperature range of between -1S°C and 25°C and preferably between -5°C and +5°C are particularly preferred, giving 3-[2-(3-chIorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)pyridinc of formula n.<br><br><br>
Addition of the Grignard reagent to compound H takes place selectively and therefore, as is seen in scheme 2, an additional step is avoided, which is, however, necessary by the Scheringprocess SI.<br>
Finally, compound HI may be converted into b) by hydrolysis, and loratadine is obtained from this product according to known techniques.<br>
The following experimental examples are now given for Hie purposes of illustrating the invention more clearly, without, however, limiting it<br>
Example 1<br><br><br>
Compound V may in turn be converted into die oxazoline by treatment with mesyl chloride<br>
and triethylamine in CHjClj at -S°C.<br>

521.7 ml of anhydrous THF and 521.7 ml of 2M LDA solution (1.04 mol) are placed in a 3-litre jacketed reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer, and maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere, the internal temperature is brought to -5°C and &amp; solution consisting of 158.8 g of oxazoline (0.835 mol) and 834.7 ml of anhydrous THF is men added slowly, keeping the temperature at about 0°C. After adding a few drops of solution, a strong blue-violet colour is obtained. The total addition time is about one hour. 154.6 g (0.96 mol) of 3-chlorobenzyl chloride are then added over about 1,5 hours, while still maintaining the temperature at 0°C. At the end of the reaction, 521.7 g of water are added while bringing the temperature to 20-25°C. The two phases are then separated and the organic phase is evaporated to give an oil. The crude product thus obtained is taken up in toluene and filtered through Tonsil. The filtrate is concentrated to give 268.1 g of an oil win an HPLC titre of 79%. 91.8% conversion, yield - 80.2%<br>

10 g of magnesium filings (0.41 mol) and 163 g of anhydrous THF are placed in a 400 ml reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a bubble condenser, a thermometer and a 100 ml dropping funnel, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The system is brought to 60°C and about 1 ml of Vitride® (70% w/w solution of sodium dihydrobis(2-methoxyethoxy)aliiminate in toluene) and about 5% of the solution of 4-cbJoro-N-methylpiperidine (S7.7 g, 0.41 mol) in 163 g of anhydrous THF are added. After a few minutes, a gentle exothermicity is noted. The remainder of the solution is men added slowly. Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is maintained at 60°C overnight The Grignard suspension, which is easily stirrable, is used without further modification in the subsequent coupling stage.<br>

(0.32 mol) and 368.6 g of anhydrous THF are placed in a 1-litre reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a 500 ml dropping funnel, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution is cooled to -20°C. Addition of the Grignard reagent prepared in the preceding stage is then started, while keeping the temperature at about -20°C, Next, the cooling is stopped and the system is allowed to return to room temperature. The reaction progress is followed by HPLC. After leaving overnight at room temperature, the HPLC monitoring shows about 2.9% (by area) of unreacted 3-[2-(3-chlorophenyl)emyl]-2-
