THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[Section 10]<br><br>
1.	SAFER CAR<br>
2.	(a)   SHAH ASHOKKUMAR DAHYABHAI (b)    6, Nemnath Society,<br>
N.N. Road, Paldi, AHMEDABAD-380 007, Gujarat, India. (C)   Nationality an Indian<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
    FINAL ACCEPTED<br><br>
This invention relates to "SAFER CAR".<br>
Though it is named "SAFER CAR" many of its innovative and novel safety features are applicable to bigger vehicles carrying passengers and cargo to reduce rider"s injuries in the event of a motor vehicle collision. This includes buses and trucks also.<br>
Since decades people use the car as the most popular vehicle of transport. Due to lack of adequate safety features, thousands of people loose their lives and limbs in accidents. Generally frontal crashes are most fatal as cars travel in the front direction with a great speed. When there is a collision, there is nothing between the car and the other object; it may be another car coming from the opposite directions or a stationary object like tree or a wall. When two cars coming from the opposite collide, the velocity of the crash is the addition of the speeds of both the cars. When a car hits another car from the back, the velocity of the crash is the subtraction of their speeds. In a sideways crash also only the speed of the hitting vehicle counts, so a frontal crash is the most harmful. In this invention strong front bumper is separated from the car chassis by a pair of strong springs and hydraulic shock absorbers. In the event of a crash, the springs and the hydraulic shock absorbers nullify most of the shock. Another novel feature of the SAFER CAR is that its brakes are released when there is a crash, so the car rolls back by the push of its strong springs. This reduces the crushing of the car body. The passenger cabin is made of a strongbox with impact beams on all the four sides and also at bottom and the top. For airbags a safer Co2 (carbon dioxide) gas is used. The airbags are perforated in such a way that an inflated airbag is automatically deflated within 5-10 seconds. This reduces the risk of suffocation to the passengers. In the event of a frontal crash the torso of passengers in held back by the seat belt but the head jerks forward with a great speed, which may be fatal. In SAFER CAR a headband is provided which is<br>
i<br><br>
attached by Velcro fastener to a stretchable band, stitched to the headrest. In seat belt also the use of Velcro fasteners is indicated. It makes opening of the seatbelt quick in case of emergency.<br>
The present invention addresses the safety drawbacks of the conventional car and will be described with greater specific and clarity with reference to the following drawings.<br>

Fig.11	represents the top view of the safety seat belt.<br>
Referring Fig.l, Front bumper (1) has distance of 15-30cms with front part (2) of the car, which is the hood of the car and it is supported by two hydraulic shock absorbers (16 &amp; 17). This arrangement effectively absorbs the shock of a collision. It has battery, engine radiator etc. on the upper side and chassis at the bottom. Front part (2) is followed by the strongbox passenger cabin (3) which in turn is followed by the backside of the car (4). Fig.2 represents top view of the front bumper, which is made of a strong<br>
3<br><br>
steel plate. It is bent at 90 angles on both the ends to protect the sides of the car. It has brackets (5, 6, 7 &amp; 8). One strong spring (12) is put between the brackets (5 &amp; 6) and other spring (12) is put between the brackets (7 &amp; 8). A strong rod (9) is attached in middle of the bumper (1) on the inside. Upon the traveling of the bumper (1) to inside the rod (9) is pushed in and it release all the brakes of the car when the push bumper (1) is pushed back upon a collision. The strong springs (12) are strong enough to push the car back by the power of their expansion so, the car rolls back and it is saved from further damage. This can be done mechanically or electrically according to the design of the car and the brakes. Rod (9) pushes in a lever that releases C02 gas from a cylinder filled with liquid Co2.This gas instantly inflates the airbags. Side view of brackets (10 &amp; 11) are attached inside of front bumper (1). This brackets (10 &amp; 11) encases the strong spring (12) and the cylinder (13) covering the spring (12). The top view of the bumper (1) with spring (12) and hydraulic shock absorber is shown in Fig. 4. This pair of brackets (10 &amp; 11) encases the cylinder (13), which holds a strong spring (12) inside it. The other end of spring (12) is attached to cylinder (14). The other cylinder (14) is also connected with chassis (15) of the car. Lower part of hydraulic shock absorber (16) is also attached to cylinder (14) at the bottom. Upon a front collision, bumper (1) pushes the strong spring (12) and travels some distance before touching the upper part of the hydraulic shock absorber (17). Now the bumper (1) travels back under joint resistance of spring (12) and hydraulic shock absorber (16 &amp; 17). As the shock of the impact is nullified by spring (12) and hydraulic shock absorber (16 &amp; 17). The spring (12) starts expanding and after expanding the spring (12) &amp; hydraulic shock absorber (16 &amp; 17) also returns to its original place. This push of the strong spring (12) makes the SAFER CAR to roll back as its wheels are free and all brakes released. This prevents further crushing of the car body. Top view of the strongbox passenger cabin (3) is represents in Fig.5. It has front impact beam (18) rear impact beam (19), middle impact beam (20), side impact (21,22, 23 &amp; 24). Each door has one impact beam (25,26,27&amp; 28) at the bottom as shown in Fig.5 and another impact beam at middle level. The strongbox is attached to the   chassis of the car by plates (29, 30, 31 &amp; 32). Side view of the<br>
4<br><br>
middle impact beam (20) of the strongbox is shown in Fig.6. It has vertical impact (53) on one side and vertical impact beam (54) on the other side. It has arch shaped top impact beam (55) at the roof of the car. This gives protection to the cabin in the car turning upside down. Side view of the single door is represented in Fig. 7. It has two impact beams (33) at middle height and (34) at the bottom height. Top frame of the door is represented by (35) and glass window (36) is fitted in it. Fig.8 represents side view of the airbag (37) is showing in its dashboard side. It has a pipe (38) at the bottom to allow the C02 gas to enter into the airbag and inflate it. It has small holes (39, 40, 41,42 &amp; 43) to allow the pressurized gas to be released slowly so that the inflated airbag (37) deflates automatically within 5-10 seconds of inflation. This eliminates the risk of the suffocated by the airbags. Side view of headband (44) is represented in Fig. 9. It has a Velcro fastening strip (45) on the backside. This strip (45) is fastened to the Velcro fastener (46) as shown in Fig. 10. It is attached to the front side of elastic stretchable band (47) that is attached to the headrest (48) at the backside (49). Elastic stretchable band (47) allows the head to go forward for 5-10 centimeter then stopping it. This prevents strong jerk to the head and the neck during the frontal crash. Top view of the safety seatbelt (50) is represented in Fig. 11, the other end (51) is overlaps at 10 centimeter and away from the seatbelt (50) so, and pressing both the ends stick together at (52). This belt is open instantly by pulling the end. Velcro fastening strip is situated at (52) on seatbelt (50). This is much more convenient and time saving in an emergency compared to the conventional band with a buckle system.<br>
