				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing storage stable, therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) as the active ingredients. More particularly this invention is directed to a process for producting a therapentic composition in an enteric release system obtained by embedding the aforesaid active ingredients in an enteric - release matrix which not only serves as an effective barrier between the active ingredients but also ensures gradual release in the intestine, simultaneously protecting the drug(s) from degradation in the acidic pH environment of the stomach.<br>
The term "enteric coating" used in this specification refers to technique, usually known in the art, refers to providing a coat or layer on substrates like tablets, pellets, granules, flakes or the like to protedct the inner core, particularly if the core material is reactive, or prone to degradation with passage of time or in contact with other material(s).<br>
Normally human body harbours different types of micro-organisms. One class of microorganism inhabiting the human body, called 'pathogens , ma&gt; be harmful to the host by causing infectious diseases. The other class of microbodies, called 'commensals', may be present in the human body for performing various useful functions, such as , for instance, providing essential vitamins to the body or preventing growth of harmful organisms within the human body.<br>
To treat and/or prevent infectious diseases caused by pathogens, anti-infective agents are used, which are, more often than not, non-specific for pathogen and may result in eliminating commensals zs well. Reduction in the number of commensals below optimum level may result in various adverse / Side effects. Diarrhoea is one such effect of treatment with antibiotics. Normal bacterial flora of the intestine provides Vitamin B complex to the human body and also prevents growth of other micro-organisms which are not congenial to the human system. Alteration of the normal flora on account of administration<br>
of antibiotics, either alone or in combination, may lead to transient dysfunction of normal colonic flora or superinfection of intestine by pathogens. The most common cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea, e.g. megacolon and pseudomembranous colities,is the result of colonisation of the colon bya toxin-producing gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium difficile.Some of the antibiotics normally used alone or in combination are, inter alia, ampicillin, amoxycillin, oliandomycin, Cepnalosporins marketed in various brand/trade names like Cephalexin, Cefixime, Certriaxone, Cefuroxine, Axetil, Proxetil, etc.), ampicillin + clanvanic acid, ampicillin+Sulbactum, fluoroquinolones, lincomycin, amoxycillin + cloxacillin, ampicilin + cloxacillin and the like.Early and specific anti-infective therapy should be given to patients suffering from diseases/disorders of the above nature.<br>
Treatment aimed at recolonisation of the gut with non-pathogenic microorganisms has included administration of lactic acid producing microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium. Streptococcus boulardii and Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactic acid producing organisms were introduced as a therapeutic agent by Metchnikoff with the idea of acidifying intestinal contents in order to prevent the growth of putrefactur organisms.The organism chosen by him for this purpose was Lactobacillus bulgaricus.These are stable and with beter therapeutic effect.<br>
Anion-exchange resins cholestyramine and cholestipol hydrochloride have been shown to bind the toxin of CI. difficile in vitro, and cholestyramine has been used to treat pseudomembranous colitis. Antibiotic associated colitis or colonic perturation has also been treated with drugs like vancomycin and metronidazole.<br>
To prevent diarrhoea or colitis, lactic acid producing microorganisms have been administered alone (e.g. Lactiflora, Lactobacil, Lactocap, Lactovit, Sporlac, etc.;, or in combination with antibiotic as two separate formulations. This necessitates consumption of two different drugs, namely, an anti-infective<br>
agent and a micro-organism, thereby decreasing patient compliance.<br>
A simple admixture of lactic acid bacillus (non-protected) with amoxycillin is not associated with any intrinsic type of resistance of lactic acid bacteria to amoxycillin. Hence, no particular safety concern is linked with such admixture.<br>
Attempts have also been made to enhance both compliance and efficacy. For this purpose, microorganisms and antibiotics have been made into a single formulation, some of which are commercially available. Anti-infective agents used in such formulations are, for instance, ampicillin, amoxycillin, which are made into simple formulation with susceptible micro-organisms.<br>
As pointed out earlier, "enteric coating" is application or formation of a layer on the tablets, granules or pellets which protects the inner core. In the event of enteric coating of tablets or granules, these are usually subjected to one or more subsequent mechanical operation, such as dry-coating, punching, capsuling and/or strip/blister packing. There is a possibility of partial rupture of the enteric coating-layer by abrasion while carrying out the subsequent mechanical operation(s).<br>
In the case of enteric-coated tablet, the live organisms are subjected to heavy compaction forces at which there is every possibility that the live organisms may lose their viability. Moreover, it has been observed that enteric-coated tablets of lactic acid bacillus fails to deliver the aggregated spores to their site of proliferation. The enteric-coated tablet dissolves in the duodenum and thus some organisms (Lactobacillus) are inactivated due to physical contact with anti-infective agent like amoxycillin in the course of its presence in duodenum till they are fully absorbed.<br>
It has also been reported that liquid formulations have been prepared in which the organisms are coated with barrier film and then mixed with other ingredients in the dry form including anti-infective agent. The product is to be<br>
reconstituted before use by addition of adequate amount of liquid, which is a rather cumbersome procedure. It has also been reported that the organisms are coated with barrier film and suspended in a liquid containing anti-infective agent(s) or vice versa. The barrier film is supposed to get disintegrated in body with the variation in pH. Such liquid formulations have not yet made their appearance in the market, and it seems unlikely that they will ever see the light of the day.<br>
When microorganisms are combined with anti-infective agents, namely, antibiotics, for convenience and ease of administration, the combination has been found to be unstable at room temperature, since microorganisms are sensitive and susceptible to the antibiotics and are destroyed by them. Analysis of commercially available formulations as well as similar formulations prepared at our end has revealed that organisms incorporated into formulation seldom perform any useful function for which they are intended. Neither the micro organisms nor their activity could be detected as early as 7 days after putting lactobacilli with various antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin -cloxacillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cephalosporin (sold under brand names as mentioned earlier), macrolides, fluoroquinolones, oliandomycin. lincomycin, etc. Although 60 million spores are put into formulation, none of them could be grown or demonstrated as viable on glucose yeast extract agar piate. It also failed to produce lactic acid as evaluated by consumption of Sodium Hydroxide (NaoH).<br>
The principal object of this invention is to overcome the difficulties and defects encountered in the conventional procedure followed hithertofore.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a storage - stable, enteric release therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) as the active ingredient.<br>
A still further object is to provide a process for preparing a therapeutic composition containing site-specific, enteric release granules in encapsulated form with an antibiotic like amoxycillin which help in avoiding the physical contact of the live organism(s) with amoxycillin throughout the gut length i.e. upto duodenum, where amoxycillin is present.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing granular form of enteric release formulation wherein the granules are so designed as to be able to release their contents beyond duodenum.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing enteric release granules capable of releasing their contents in intesting beyond duodenum in weakly acidic to alkaline pH of around 6.8 - 7.2, thus avoiding physical contact between antibiotic and lactic acid bacillus.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention according to which there is provided a process for preparing a storage - stable, enteric - release therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) as the active ingredients, which comprises in combination the following steps :<br>
(a) preparing enteric matrix formulation in a manner such as herein described ;<br>
(b) embedding micro organism(s) in an amount of around 80% overage by being mixed with the enteric matrix formulation to form granules ;<br>
(c) admixing enteric release granules from step (b) with gastric release granules of antibiotics in presence of pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, additives, fillers and/or adjuvants such as herein described so that the ratio of microorganism to antibiotic in the final composition varies between 1.2 and 1.75 and<br>
(d) finally filling the granules in hard gelatin capsule cells which are thereafter strip - sealed and packed as may be required or needed.<br>
As may be noted the foregoing discussions, this invention resides in a process of preparation of a stable, fixed dose combination of antibiotic with live microorganism as active, ingredients, various dosage forms for oral route like capsules, tablets and liquid formulations may be prepared according to the process of this invention. An appropriate barrier is provided for the microorganisms by means of a selected coating, which has been, found to be stable for 3-36 months under ambient conditions. The lactic acid bacillus is embedded on an enteric release matrix. The ratio of the microorganism to the antibiotic in the composition may be varied between 1.2 - 1.75 by weight, 1.5 being the optimal. The amount of coating depends on the type of coating technique, dosage form and desired shelf-life.<br>
For oral route formulation, organisms are coated by enteric coating, e.g. with cellulose acetate phthalate alone or in admixture with a resin polymer (Endragit). Antibiotic can be penicillin or ampicillin alone or in combination with resistant semi synthetic penicillin, e.g. amoxycillin alone or combined with penicillanase resistant penicillin. In the course of work, it was observed that it was difficult to produce a culture of this microbody in the intestine and preferred using L. acidophilus, which is a common commercial of human intestine. Preparations using various Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid producing organisms have been used in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Metabolic acidosis has been observed following the use of products contaning L. acidophillus. These organisms have been found to be capable of eradicating or helpong in eradication of pathogens like CI. difficile by a number of mechasims which include, inter alia, production of hydrogen peroxide, or inhibition of adherence of pathogens to intestinal wa11s.<br>
In the enteric release matrix technique adopted in the present instance, the drug is embedded in the said matrix wherein the possibility of rupture of enteric coating layer due to abrasion or other mechanical reasons is absolutely remote. This, therefore, ensures better protection to the drug which is intended to be released in the intestine and be protected in the acidic pH environment of the stomach.<br>
The enteric - release technique used in the present instance achieves another desirable result. The admixture of site - specific enteric release granules of lactic acid bacillus in amoxycillin capsule helps to avoid physical contact between the living organisms with amoxycillin throughout the entire length of the gut, i.e. upto duodenum. These granules are so designed that they ensure release of the microorganisms beyond duodenum in intestine after around 4 hours of intake of the medication. The enteric - release granules dissolve in a slightly acidic to a low alkaline medium, between, say, a pH range of 6.8 and 7.2, somewhere in jejumum, thereby avoiding physical contact between the antibiotic (say. amoxycillin) and lactic acid baciPus.<br>

ASSAY<br>
A. CONTENT OF AMOXYCILLIN :<br>
Weigh accurately a quantity of the mixed contents of 20 capsules equivalent to 0.15 g of amoxycillin, add sufficient water to produce 500 m!., shake for 30 minutes and filter. To 10.0 ml of the filtrate add 10 ml. of alkaline borate buffer pH 9.0 followed by 1 ml. of acetic anhydride - dioxan solution, allow to stand for 5 minutes and add sufficient water to produce 100 ml. Transfer 2 ml. of the resulting solution into each of two stoppered tubes. To one tube add 10 ml. of imidazole - mercury reagent, mix, stopper the tube and immerse in a water-bath at 60° for exactly 25 minutes with occasional swirling. Remove the tube from the water-bath and cool rapidl) to 20° (solution A).<br>
To the second tube add 10 ml. of water and mix (solution B). Without delay measure i .e absorbances of solutions A and B at the maximum at about 325 nm, using as the blank a mixture of 2 ml of water and 10 ml. of imidazole - mercury reagent for solution A and water for solution B. Calculate the content of C16H19N3OsS from the difference between the absorbances of solution A and solution B, from the difference obtained by repeating tnc operation usmg 0. IT gsn. of amoxycillin trihydrate RS instead of the substance being examined and from the declared content of C,6H19N305S in amoxycillin trihydrateRS.<br>
B. DETERMINATION OF SPORE COUNT OF LACTIC ACID BACILLUS I EACH CAPSULE:<br>
PROCEDURE:<br>
Take contents of 5 capsules and transfer it into homogenizing Cup (Mixie). Add exactly 300 ml. of sterile normal saline solution and homogenize at about 12000 - 15000 R.P.M. for five minutes. This makes TEST SOLUTION of 1:300 dilution.<br>
Mix well the TEST SOLUTION (1:300 dilution) by hand shaking and dilute it further<br>
'stepwise through a series of test tubes (size 25 mm x 150 mm), containing 9 ml. of sterile normal saline blank solution by an appropriate decimal dilution method. The .final dilution should be 300 x 104.<br>
Allow to stand the final diluted tube in a water bath at 75°C for 30 minutes (Heat -Shock), cooi immediately to about 45°C.<br>
Pipette accurately 1 ml. for Heat - Shock solution and add into each of five sterile petridishes. Add about 15 ml. of Glucose Yeast Extract Agar medium previously sterilized, melted and cooled to 45°C, to each of the five petri-dishes. Incubate the plates at 37°C for 72 hours and count the number of colonies in each plate. The average number of colonies, multiplied by the dilution factor and divide by five represents the SPORES COUNT per capsule.<br>
For example, if average count per plate is 100 colonies and final dilution factor is 300 x 10 4 then viable count :<br><br>
MEDIA AND REAGENTS:<br>
All chemicals to be used should be either A.R. or G.R. grade unless othei wise specified.<br><br>

Havb-2 described the invention in detail with particular reference to the appended Examples, it sill now be more specifically defined by means of claims appended hereafter.<br>
Wo claim :<br>
1. A process for preparing a storage-stable, enteric release therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) as the active ingredients, which comprises -<br>
(a) combining enteric release granules containing microorganism(s) with gastric release granules of antibiotics in presence of pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, fillers and/or adjuvants such as herein described and<br>
(b) filling the granules in hard gelatin capsules or compressing the granules into tablet form which in turn may be stripped, sealed and packed,<br>
characterized in that the said enteric release granules containing desired microorganism!s) are prepared by embedding the said microorganism(s) in an amount of around 80% overage by mixing with an enteric matrix formulation prepared from cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, ~Polysorbate 80" and acetone in amounts and manner such as herein described followed by conversion into granular form.<br>
2. A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the ratio of microorganism to antibiotic in the final composition varies between 1.2 and 1.75, optimally 1.5.<br>
_j. A process as claimed in Claims 1 and 2, wherein the enteric release granules tend to give up their contents and disperse/ dissolve in the intestine after about 4 hours of intake with the rise in pH to around 6.8, thereby ensuring physical isolation of the active ingredients.<br>
4. A process as claimed in Claims 1 to 3, wherein the composition is effective against toxin producing gram positive anaerobic bacteria Clostridium difficile.<br>
5. A process as claimed in any of the preceding Claims, wherein there is added to the composition one or more chemicals selected from the group of cellulose acetate phthalate, ethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol 6000 for enhancing storage stability and/or prolonging the time of release of medication in human system.<br>
6. A process for preparing a storage—stable, enteric release therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) as the active ingredients, substantially as hereinbefore described with particular reference to the appended Examples.<br>
Dated this 16th day of May, 2002.<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a storage - stable, enteric relea therapeutic composition containing one or more antibiotics and microorganism(s) a, the active ingredients. The process resides in sequentially carrying out the steps of (i) preparation of enteric matrix formulation, (ii) preparation of enteric - release granules of Lactic Acid Bacillus, (iii) preparation of acid release matrix formulation, (iv) preparation of acid - release granules containing antibiotic or mixture thereof and (v) preparation of encapsulated form of drug containing the active ingredients aforesaid.</td>
