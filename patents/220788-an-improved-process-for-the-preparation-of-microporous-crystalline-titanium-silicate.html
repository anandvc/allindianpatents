				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of crystalline microporous titanium silicates.<br>
More specifically it relates to an improved process for the preparation of titanium silicate with crystal structure of silicalite-1. More particularly the present invention relates to the preparation of titanium silicate by using ethyl silicate-40 and titanium peroxide as silicon and titanium sources and tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide as template. Particularly the present invention relates to the preparation of titanium silicates by adding sequence of clear titanium peroxide solution to ethyl silicate-40 to obtain a homogeneous reactive gel which is further hydrolyzed with a very low amount of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as template without any use of organic solvent for preparation of the starting gel and keeping it for hydrothermal synthesis. By the process of present invention, titanium silicate with a higher titanium content (Si/Ti = 20) of comparable catalytic activity with conventional TS-1 catalyst has been prepared at a considerably lower cost because of cheaper silicon source as well as low TPAOH template requirement. The material obtained by the present invention is useful as an active catalyst in the reactions such as:<br>
1) Oxidation of hydrocarbons or derivatives of hydrocarbons such as benzene to phenol, oxidation of phenol to hydroquinone and catechol 2) conversion of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanone oxime 3) conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde 4) isopropnol to acetone etc.<br>
hi the prior art, a UK patent GB 2071071 describes a process for the preparation of titanium containing silicalite-1 designated as TS-1 has been described. The procedure involved in this process is to mix silicon source (preferably silicon tetraethoxide), titanium source (titanium tetraethoxide), organic base (tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide) and water. The mixture is further heated hydro thermally to obtain microporous material with silicalite-1 structure. Due to the difference in the rate of hydrolysis of silicon tetraethoxide and titanium tetraethoxide, formation of sparingly soluble titanium oxide (TiO2) before the formation of titanosilicate, hinders the incorporation of titanium in the tetrahedral framework leading to a titanium-depleted material. Also in the prior art, the chemical composition of such titanium silica (TS-1) has been claimed to be xTiOα : (1-x) SiO2 wherein x is in the range of 0.0001 to 0.04.<br>
The material has found applications in various oxidation reactions such as the conversion of benzene into phenol, phenol into hydroquinone and catechol, cyclohexanone into cyclohexanone oxime, ethanol into acetaldehyde, isopropanol into acetone, benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde and benzoic acid etc.<br>
To overcome this limitation the silicon and titanium sources are hydrolyzed completely with organic base before mixing to obtain a clear liquid reaction mixture, which results in the titanium rich crystalline material.<br>
US patent 4,410,501 describes a process for the preparation of titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1). The samples were prepared by hydrothermal crystallization of precursor gel containing tetraethyl orthosilicate Si (OEt) 4 or silica sol (Ludox AS 40) as a silicon source and tetraethyl orthotitanate Ti (OEt)4 as titanium source. The preparation requires first mixing of Ti (OEt)4 in silica source at low temperature (5°C) followed by the addition of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution to perform hydrolysis of the alkoxides. The micrporous crystalline product had the silicalite-1 structure with chemical composition xTiO2 : (1-x) SiO2 where x lies between 0.0005 and 0.04. The patent also describes the use of titanium peroxide as titanium source. Tetraethyl titanium is hydrolyzed to obtain white gelatinous suspension, which was cooled at 5° C and 30% hydrogen peroxide was added to the cooled suspension to obtain orange colored solution of titanium peroxide. At this point 25% aqueous tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide was added at 5° C. After one hour, Ludox colloidal silica, containing 40% of SiOα was added and the gel was heated in an autoclave at 175° C for ten days to obtain crystalline TS-1 product. The main drawback in this procedure is the addition of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide to titanium peroxide solution, which will decompose the titanium peroxide to titanium oxide/hydroxide, which will hinder the incorporation of titanium into silicalite framework structure yielding low titanium containing TS-1 product with lower catalytic activity. The reactive titanium peroxide species used for the synthesis of TS-1 with high titanium content are destroyed by the addition of TPAOH to titanium peroxide as titanium peroxide is not stable in alkaline medium.<br>
Another process for the preparation (A. Thangraj, M. J. Eapen, S. Sivasanker and P. Ratnasamy, Zeolites, 12 (1992) 943) involves the complete hydrolysis of silicon<br>
tetraethoxide with organic base to obtain clear liquid to which titanium butoxide was added as a titanium source. By this process the titanium containing silicalite-1 was obtained with the chemical composition claimed to be xTiO2 : (1-x) SiO2 wherein x is in the range 0.04 - 0.2. Such titanium rich silicas are found more active in the catalytic conversion of phenol to catechol and hydroquinone as compared to the TS-1 mentioned in the UK patent.<br>
Another process for the preparation of titanium silicalite (A. Tuel, Y. Ben Taarit. Applied Catalysis A: General 110, 1994, 137-151) is described using various silicon and titanium alkoxides. Silicon propoxide and silicon butoxide whose rate of hydrolysis are very low leading to the formation of poorly crystalline material, containing extra framework species at very low titanium content. No significant influence of the titanium source was observed using silicon ethoxide as silicon source. However h higher titanium incorporation was obtained with silicon methoxide without formation of extra framework species.<br>
In all the above applications, it has been found that catalytic efficiency of TS-1 is directly proportional to the content of titanium in titanium silicalite (TS-1).<br>
The process for the preparation of TS-1 with enhanced catalytic activity and having the chemical formula xTiOz : (1-x) SiOα wherein x greater than 0.04 and less than or equal to 0.075 described in US patent 5,885,546 involves the use of acetylacetone forming a soluble complexing agent with titanium source.<br>
In all of the prior arts, efficient incorporation of titanium in silicalite framework i.e. the formation of Si-O-Ti bonds occurs only when it is formed during the reactive gel formation. It is possible only if the rate of hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide matches with that of silicon alkoxide, or silicon alkoxide is first hydrolyzed to obtain polymerized Q1, Q2, Q3 species of Si-OH groups, before titanium alkoxide is added and hydrolyzed in-situ to facilitate Si-O-Ti bonds for this purpose, silicon ethoxide or preferably silicon methoxide should be used. Due to the special techniques required for the preparation, higher cost of silicon tetramethoxide / silicon tetraethoxide as well as requirement of higher amount TPAOH as template increases the cost of titanium containing silicalite-1 which is major bottleneck for its commercial utilization.<br>
In our previous patent (V/F 25/97) we have described a process for the preparation of titanium containing silicalite-1 using ethylsilicate-40 and butyl titanate as silicon source and titanium source respectively in isopropyl alcohol and simultaneous hydrolysis using tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of titanium silicates, which is titanium rich as well as has comparable catalytic activity and also which is highly cost effective.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparation of microporous, crystalline titanium silicate having a silicalite-1 structure and a chemical composition of formula xTiO2: (1-x) SiO2 wherein x is in the range of 0.001 to 0.05, which comprises:<br>
a)	adding a solution of  titanium peroxide as a titanium source to ethyl silicate<br>
with and without an organic solvent to obtain a homogenous gel,<br>
b)	hydrolyzing the above said gel by adding an aqueous tetrapropyl ammonium<br>
hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic base to the above said resultant gel  with<br>
silica to TPAOH ratio in the range of 1:0.06 to 0.15   followed by adding<br>
deionised water when yellow white gel get turned to greenish white gel,<br>
c)	stirring the above said resultant gel for about 1 hr,<br>
d)	heating the above said gel at an autogenous pressure, at a temperature ranging<br>
between 100 to 180°C for a period of 1-4 days,<br>
e)	separating the resultant product by known method, drying and calcining the<br>
resultant solid composite material at a temperature in the range of 350-550°C in<br>
the presence of air to obtain the final desired product.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the ethyl silicate used is a source of silicon<br>
oxide.<br>
In an another embodiment the ethyl silicate used is ethyl silicate 40.<br>
In yet another embodiment the ethyl silicate 40 used is a condensed product of<br>
orthosilicate such as tetramer, pentamer or hexamer.<br>
In yet another embodiment the organic solvent used is alcohol having 2 to 5 number of<br>
carbon atoms, selected from the group consisting of ethyl, propyl and butyl.<br>
In yet another embodiment the silica to TPAOH ratio used is preferably 1:0.1.<br>
In yet another embodiment the starting mixture has a chemical molar composition of 0.0.6-1 R4N+OH : 0.001 - 0.05TiO2 : SiO2: 25-55 H2O where R is a propyl group.<br>
The present invention provides a cost effective process for the preparation of microporous, crystalline titanium silicate with silicalite-1 structure which comprises forming a gel by addition of clear solution of a titanium source to a silicon source, stirring the mixture, addition of a template and water, again stirring the resultant gel, heating the resultant gel at autogenous pressure to a temperature between 100 to 180°C for 1-4 days; cooling the reaction mixture, separating the product by conventional methods, washing, drying and calcining the resultant solid composite material at a temperature in the range of 350-550°C in the presence of air. The final anhydrous titanium silicate of the present invention has the composition as:<br>
xTiO2: (1-x) SiO2 where x is in the range of 0.001 and 0.05.<br>
hi the present invention, titanium peroxide, a water soluble source of titanium is used as titanium source in the preparation of titanium silicate, which forms Si-O-Ti linkages in the gel after increasing the pH of the gel using tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide template.<br>
The crystalline material of this invention can be characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopic (IR) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination. Corresponding XRD data for pure silicalite-1 are shown in Table 1 a: the 20 values may vary by ± 0.05° b: R.I: Relative Intensity, vs : very strong, s: strong, m medium, w : weak.<br>
The most significant lines of the x-ray powder diffraction of the titanium silicate taken on a Rigaku, Miniflex model, with Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation along with the Silicalite-1 is more fully described by Flanigen E.M. and others in the Journal Nature, 271, 512 (1978). The FTIR spectra in KBr matrix were scanned on Nicholet60SXB spectrometer. A characteristic IR absorption band at about 958 cm"1 , which is assigned to the titanium in the tetrahedral framework of silicate samples is shown in table-2.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The wave number value may vary by ± 2 cm"<br>
a: R.I: Relative Intensity, vs : very strong, s : strong, m : medium, w : weak.<br>
This band is not observed in case of silicalite-1 and oxides of titanium (Rutile, Anatase) and alkaline titanates. A linear correlation is observed in the ratio of the intensity of 958 cm"1 band and that of 800 cm"1 band with the titanium content in the silicate.<br>
The unit cell parameters of the titanium silicalite of the present invention containing varying amounts of titanium in the range of x = 0.001 to 0.06, where x denotes the stoichiometry of titanium as given by the formula x Ti02 : SiOa, are in the Table 3.<br><br>

The scanning electron micrographs of the materials by the process of the present invention were taken on JEOL JSM 5200 instrument. SEM photograph show that the crystallite size distribution fall within the narrow range of 2 to 8 µm and are spheroidal in shape. The absorption capacities of calcined forms of the material of the present invention determined gravimetrically using a conventional Me Bain balance at 298 K and P/Po = 0.5 for cyclohexane water and n-hexane were found to be 7.2 %, 7.1 % and 11.6 % (wt/wt) respectively. The adsorption studies demonstrate the absence of amorphous material occluded within the pores the titanium silicate of the present invention. Though the catalyst composite material obtained may be used directly as a catalyst, it is desirable in various applications, to enhance the mechanical strength and ease of handling by admixing it with a suitable binder material and converting it into a suitable shape such as cylindrical extrudates, spheres, etc. silica, alumina, clay minerals such as bentonite, kaolinite or mixture thereof are suitable binder materials which impart improved mechanical strength to the Titanium Silicate catalyst composite material.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of ethyl silicate-40 and titanium peroxide as a source of silicon and titanium, which makes this process of gel preparation very simpler and highly cost effective as compared to the prior art processes where costly silicon tetra ethoxide and titanium tetra ethoxide are used as a source of silicon and titanium and special precautions are to be taken while carrying out gel preparation.<br>
Titanium Silicate and its composite material prepared by the process of the present invention is useful as a catalyst in various hydrocarbon conversion reactions such as 1) oxidation of hydrocarbons or derivatives of hydrocarbons 2) Ammoxidation of ketones, aldehides, and 3) oxidation of organic sulphides, amines etc.<br>
