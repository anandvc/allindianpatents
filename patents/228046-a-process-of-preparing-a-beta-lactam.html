BACKGFIOUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to taxanes, compounds<br>
useful in the preparation of taxanes, and synthetic methods useful in the<br>
preparation of taxanes.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The taxane family of terpenes has received much attention in the<br>
scientific and medical community because members of this family have<br>
demonstrated broad spectrum anti-leukemic and tumor-inhibitory activity. A<br>
well-known member of this family is paclitaxel, which has the following<br>
structure,<br><br>
wherein Ac is acetyl, Bz is benzoyl, Ph is phenyl, the 2' position has the R<br>
configuration and the 3' position has the S configuration. Paclitaxel was first<br>
isolated from the bark of the pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) in 1971, and has<br>
proved to be a potent natural anticancer agent. For example, paclitaxel has<br>
been found to have activity against different forms of leukemia and against solid<br>
tumors in the breast, ovary, brain, and lung in humans.<br>
This activity has stimulated an intense research effort over recent<br>
years, including the search for other taxanes having similar or improved<br>
properties, and the development of synthetic pathways for making taxanes such<br>
as paclitaxel. One result from this research effort was the discovery of an<br>
i analog of paclitaxel called taxotere. Taxotere has been found to have very<br>
good anti-tumor activity and better bio-availability than paclitaxel. Taxotere is<br><br>
similar in structure to paclitaxel, having t-butoxycarbonyl instead of benzoyl on<br>
the amino group at the 3' position, and a hydroxyl group instead of the acetoxy<br>
group at the C-10 position (see EP 253738 for a discussion of taxotere).<br>
Taxanes are structurally complicated molecules, and the<br>
development of commercially viable synthetic methods to make taxanes has<br>
been a challenge. Semi-synthetic pathways have been developed, where<br>
these methods begin with the isolation of a naturally occurring material and<br>
then the conversion of that material to the taxane of interest. One such<br>
pathway for the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel begins with 10-deacetylbaccatin III,<br>
a taxane isolated from the needles of the English yew tree (Taxus baccata). A<br>
semi-synthetic route for the production of taxotere has been reported that<br>
involves coupling of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-(2R, 3S)-3-phenylisoserine with 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III in conjunction with proper protecting groups (Tetrahedron<br>
Letters 33:5185, 1992). The synthesis of taxotere has also been reported using<br>
enantiomerically pure beta-lactams as intermediates (J. Org. Chem. 56:1681.<br>
1991; Tetrahedron 48:6985,1992).<br>
Synthesis of beta-lactam from an aldehyde via N-trimethylsilyl<br>
imine intermediates is described by Hart et al. (J. Org. Chem. 48:289, 1983).<br>
U.S. Application Publication No. US2001/0014746 by Holton<br>
discloses a process for preparing N-acyl, N-sulfonyl and N-phosporyl<br>
substituted isoserine esters in which a metal alkoxide is reacted with a beta-<br>
lactam. Holton further discloses a process of preparing a N-substituted beta-<br>
lactam via a N-substituted imine.<br>

substituted unnatural amino acids (Tetrahedron 43:3881, 1987).<br>

stabilized sulfur ylide and a tosyl protected imine (Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.<br>

amino ester via ring-opening of oxazoline-5-carboxylates (Org.. Lett. 2(9):1243,<br>
2000).<br>

beta-amino ester via ring-opening of aziridine-2-carbonxylates (Synlett 5:679,<br>

beta-lactam via phenyrthio substituted bsta-lactam (J. Org. Chem. 54:5758,<br>

a SN2 substitution (Tetrahedron Lett. 47:5577, 2000).<br>

Freihammer et al. discloses N-protection of 3-phenylsulfonyl-beta-<br>
lactam (J. Org. Chem. 65:7203, 2000).<br>
WO 94/29288 (Kelly et al.) discloses 7-deoxy taxol derivatives<br>
obtained by coupling of a baccatin compound and an oxazolidine free acid.<br>
US Patent No. 5,821,363 (Wicnienski et al.) discloses 7-deoxy<br>
taxol derivatives obtained by coupling of a baccatin compound and an<br>
oxazolidine free acid.<br>
WO 94/13655 (Hester et al.) 7-deoxy taxol derivatives obtained by<br>
coupling of a baccatin compound and an oxazolidine free acid.<br>
While significant advances have been made in this field, there<br>
remain a need for improved synthetic techniques for the production of paclitaxel<br>
and analogs thereof such as taxotere. For example, existing semi-synthetic<br>
pathways for production of paclitaxel generally involve coupling of a suitable<br>
side chain precursor to the free hydroxyl group at position 13 of 10-<br>
deacetylbascatin III. Fully synthetic pathways also employ addition of such<br>
side-chains in a similar way. Thus, there is a need for improved routes for the<br>
generation of such precursors of the C-13 side chain, particularly since this<br>
side-chain has been found to be an important structural feature. The present<br>
invention fulfils these needs and provides other related advantages.<br>

carbonyl. Examples include acetyl, benzoyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and the like. Lower-acyl refers to groups<br>
containing one to four carbons.<br>

5 isoquinoline, quinoxaline, pyrimidine, pyrazine, tetrazole and pyrazole.<br><br>
The term "leaving group" (LG) refer to a chemical moiety that may<br>
be displaced during a substitution or elimination reaction. Exemplary leaving<br>
groups include halide (e.g., bromide and chloride) and as tosyl.<br>
The term "halogenating agent" refers to a chemical that may be<br>
added to a reaction mixture to cause the addition of a halide to a carbon of an<br>
organic molecule. Halogenating agents include, for example, inorganic acid<br>
halides, for example thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus<br>
tribromide, phosphoryl chloride trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, N-<br>
iodosuccinimide and phosphorus pentachloride. Other halogenating are known<br>

added dropwise to the cooled stirred solution of the imine at about 0°C. To the<br>
resulting solution is added dropwise a tertiary amine, e.g., triethylamine, also at<br>
about 0°C. The reaction mixture is gradually warmed to room temperature and<br>
kept at this temperature for about 16 hours. The reaction is quenched by<br>
pouring into ice-cold water and extracted three times with dichloromethane and<br>
dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated to give the<br>
crude product which is purified by column chromatography using<br>
dichloromethane initially followed by mixtures of hexane/ethyl acetate to get the<br>
pure cis and trans β-lactams shown in Reaction 3. The cis and trans isomers<br>
may be separated from one another by, e.g., column chromatography. Either<br>

7. Conversion of a 3-phenylisoserine compound to another 3-<br>
phenylisoserine compound<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a process whereby<br>
a thioaryl group in a phenylisoserine compound is replaced with a hydroxyl<br>
group, as shown in the following Reaction 21.<br><br>
In Reaction 21, PG is an amine protecting group, Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl groups, E<br>
is hydrogen or an organic group, and Hg represents a mercury-containing<br>
oxidizing agent. Optionally, PG is benzoyl or tBOC, and/or E is hydrogen,<br>
and/or An is phenyl, and/or Ar2 is phenyl. Two exemplary mercuric oxidizing<br>
agents are HgO and Hg(CF3CO2)2.<br>
For example, the present invention provides that a thiophenyl<br>
group located at the 2-position of a 3-phenylisoserine may be replaced with a<br>
hydroxyl group of the opposite configuration, as shown in Reaction 22.<br><br><br>
More specifically, a trans 2-thiophenyl 3-phenylisoserine compound is dissolved<br>
in an inert solvent, e.g., freshly distilled THF, under an inert atmosphere, e.g.,<br>
argon gas, and a mercury-containing oxidizing agent, e.g., mercuric oxide<br>
(HgO) or Hg(CF3CO2)2 as shown in Reaction 22, is added in one portion at<br>
room temperature and the reaction mixture stirred at this temperature for about<br>
72 hrs. The reaction is worked up according to procedures known in the art for<br>
reactions with mercuric oxidizing agent, and the product is purified by column<br>
chromatography using mixtures of acetone/methanol to afford the pure cis<br>
phenylisoserine side chain.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process<br>
whereby a hydroxyl group in a phenylisoserine compound is converted to a<br>
protected hydroxyl group, as shown in Reaction 23.<br><br>
In Reaction 23, PG1 is an amine protecting group, Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl groups,<br>

Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis," Second Edition, John Wiley<br>
and Sons, New York, N.Y., 1991, Chapters 2 and 3.<br><br>
For example, the present invention provides for the acylation of<br>
the 2-hydroxy group of a 3-phenyl-2-hydroxy isoserine compound, as shown in<br>
Reaction 24.<br><br>
More specifically, a cis phenylisoserine compound is dissolved in a basic<br>
solvent, e.g., pyridine, under an inert atmosphere, e.g., argon gas, at about<br>
room temperature and acetyl chloride is added dropwise to the stirred solution.<br>
The solution is stirred for about 30 minutes and worked up according to<br>
methods known in the art for acylation reaction. The crude product is purified<br>
by column chromatography using mixtures of dichloromethane/methanol to<br>
afford the pure acetylated cis phenylisoserine side chain acid.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process<br>
whereby a thioaryl group is removed from an arylisoserine compound, as<br>
illustrated by the scheme<br><br>
wherein Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl groups independently selected at each occurrence,<br>
R5 is selected from hydrogen, benzoyl and tBOC, R6 is C1-C6 alkyl, R7 is H or<br>
C1-C6 alkyl, and E represents a desulfuration reagent. Raney nickel is a<br>
suitable desulfurization reagent. In a preferred embodiment, each of Ar1 and<br>
Ar2 is phenyl. For example, the present invention provides a process whereby<br>
a thioaryl group is removed from an arylisoserine compound as illustrated by<br>
the scheme of Reaction 25.<br><br><br>
In the above scheme, Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl groups, E is hydrogen or an organic<br>
group, and OPG represents a protected hydroxy! group. Optionally, Ar1 is<br>
phenyl, and/or Ar2 is phenyl, and/or E is hydrogen and/or PG is acetyl or<br>

Thus, the present invention provides compounds of the formula<br><br>
wherein Ar2 is an aryl group R5 is selected from hydrogen, benzoyl and tBOC,<br>
R6 is a hydroxyl protecting group, and R7 is H or C1-C6 alkyl. Optionally, R6 is<br>
selected from methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, benzyloxymethyl,<br>
(beta-trimethylsilyl-ethoxy)methyl,	tetrahydropyranyl,	2,2,2-trichloro-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl,	benzyloxycarbonyl,	tert-butoxycarbonyl,	9-<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl,	2,2,2-trichloroethoxymethyl,	trimethylsilyl,<br>

dichloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl and trifluoroacetyl.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process<br>
whereby a protecting group is added to the amino group of an arylisoserine<br>
i compound, as illustrated in the scheme of Reaction 26.<br><br>
Reaction 26<br><br>
In Reaction 26, Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl groups, E is hydrogen or an organic group,<br>
PG1 represents a hydroxyl protecting group and PG2 represents an amine<br>
protecting group. Optionally, Ar1 is phenyl, and/or Ar2 is phenyl, and/or E is<br>
hydrogen and/or PG1 is acetyl. Optionally, when paclitaxel is the target taxane,<br>
PG2 is a benzoyl group. However, when taxotere is the target taxane, then PG2<br>
is a tBOC group.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a protecting group is<br>
added to the amine group of a 3-arylisoserine compound, and a thioaryl group<br>
is removed from the alpha carbon, as illustrated in Reaction 27, where phenyl is<br>
shown as a representative aryl group, acetate is shown as a representative<br>
hydroxyl protecting group, and benzoyl is shown as a representative amine<br>
protecting group.<br>
Reaction 27<br><br>
More specifically, a phenylisoserine compound is dissolved in ethanol at room<br>
temperature and Raney nickel is added in one portion to the stirred solution and<br>
the reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 3 hrs. The reaction<br>
mixture is filtered and the filtrate is evaporated. The residue is dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane and worked up as usual. This resulting solid is dissolved in<br>
pyridine under argon atmosphere and benzoyl chloride added dropwise at room<br>
temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for about 4 hrs.<br>
The reaction mixture is acidified with 0.1 N HCI and the crude product is<br>
extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are dried over<br><br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to dryness. The<br>
crude product is purified by column chromatography using<br>
dichloromethane/methanol to afford the pure cis 2'-acetylated phenylisoserine<br>
side chain. When taxotere is the target taxane, a reagent that adds a tBOC<br>
group to an amine group may be used in lieu of benzoyl chloride.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the protecting group on the<br>
nitrogen atom of a 3-phenylisoserine compound is replaced with a different<br>
protecting group as illustrated in Reaction 28.<br><br>
Here, a O-t-BOC protected phenylisoserine compound is treated under<br>
reducing conditions as shown in reaction 28, and then benzoylated using<br>
benzoyl chloride in pyridine according to reaction 27 to give the 2'-protected<br>
phenylisoserine taxol side chain.<br>
8. Combinations of Reactions<br>
The various reactions described in this section may be carried out<br>
sequentially, so long as the product of one reaction may be used as the starting<br>
material: of another reaction. Each of these possible combinations is a separate<br>
aspect of the present invention. Exemplary reaction sequences are shown in<br>
l Figures 1-3.<br>
C. Baccatin III Compounds<br>
C7-dichloroacetvl baccatin III<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides C7-dichloroacetyl<br>
baccatin III of the following formula (R7 = -OCOCHCI2).<br><br><br>
This compound is a useful intermediate in the production of taxanes. This<br>
compound may be prepared according to Reaction 29, which is another aspect<br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
In Reaction 29, the base may be an amine base, e.g.,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The reaction is typically conducted in an inert<br>
solvent, e.g., dichloromethane (DCM). For example, Baccatin III may be<br>
dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane under an argon atmosphere at room<br>
temperature. To this solution is added DMAP followed by dichloroacetyl<br>
chloride. The mixture is left at room temperature for overnight. The mixture is<br>
then quenched with cold water and extracted thrice with dichloromethane. The<br>
organic layer is washed with water and than with brine to remove unwanted<br>
salts. The organic layer may then be dried and evaporated under vacuum, and<br>
the residue recrystallized or column chromatographed with<br>
dichloromethane/ethyl acetate mixtures to afford C7 protected baccatin III.<br>
Alternatively, the C7 protected baccatin ill or C7 and C10<br>
protected baccatin III can also be prepared from 10 DAB or 9DHB (9-dihydro-<br>
13-acetylbaccatin III) in a similar manner.<br><br>
C7-triethylsilyl baccatin III<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides C7-triethylsilyl<br>
baccatin III of the following formula (R7 = -O-Si(CH2CH3)3).<br><br>
This compound is a useful intermediate in the production of taxanes. This<br>
compound may be prepared according to Reaction 30, which is another aspect<br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
In Reaction 30, the base may be an amine base, e.g.,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine. The reaction is typically conducted<br>
in an inert solvent, e.g., dichloromethane (DCM). For example, Baccatin III may<br>
be dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane under an argon atmosphere at<br>
room temperature. To this solution is added pyridine followed by triethylsilyl<br>
chloride. The mixture is left at room temperature for overnight. The mixture is<br>
then quenched with cold water and extracted thrice with dichloromethane. The<br>
organic layer is washed with water and than with brine to remove unwanted<br>
salts. The organic layer may then be dried and evaporated under vacuum, and<br>
the residue recrystallized or column chromatographed with<br>
dichloromethane/ethyl acetate mixtures to afford C7 protected baccatin III.<br><br>
A. Condensation of the 07 Protected Baccatin III with the Side Chain<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides for the coupling<br>
of a sidechain as described in the previous section, which may be either a beta<br>
lactam or a phenylisoserine, with a baccatin-type compound.. In general, the<br>
baccatin-type compound is described by the formula<br><br>
wherein R6 and R7 are selected from hydrogen and hydroxy protecting groups.<br>
The sidechain couples to the baccatin-type compound at the hydroxyl group<br>
located at C13 of the baccatin-type compound. In various exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention: R6 is acetyl and R7 is triethylsily (TES); R6 is<br>
acetyl and R7 is -COCHCI2; R6 is dichloroacetyl and R7 is triethylsily (TES); or<br>
R8 is dichloroacetyl and R7 is -COCHCI2. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
coupling is performed in the presence of a dialkylcarbodiimide, e.g.,<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.<br>
In one embodiment, a di-chloroacetyl baccatin III (R7 = -<br>
OCOCHCI2) or -O-triethylsilyl (-O TES) baccatin III of the following formula<br>
(I"):<br><br>
is reacted with an N-CBz C2'-protected 3-phenylisoserine side chain of the<br>
following formula (lla"), or with a p-lactam of the following formula (lIb"):<br><br><br>
to form an intermediate of the following formulas (III") or (IV"):<br><br>
In another embodiment, the intermediate of formula (III") or (IV) is<br>
further modified to yield paclitaxel or analogs thereof. For example, the R7<br>
group at the C7 position and the R group at the C2' site may be converted to<br>
hydroxyl groups to yield paclitaxel. In one embodiment of the invention, these<br>
coupling reactions are accomplished under the influence of a<br>
dialkylcarbodiimide, e.g., DCC.<br>
In general, reaction of a beta lactam (see, e.g., Reactions 6, 8, 9,<br>
12, and 13) or a phenylisoserine side chain (see, e.g., Reactions 10, 11, 18, 20,<br>
22 and 24) may be accomplished by reacting with a C7 protected baccatin III<br>
(Schemes I and II below) to yield an intermediate of the following formula (IlIa")<br>
or (lllb") or (IVa") or (IVb"):<br><br><br>
wherein R6 is acetyl, R7 is a hydroxy protecting group, and R8 is benzoyl<br>
(compound IlIa") or t-BOC (compound lllb"); and<br><br>
wherein R6 is acetyl, R7 is a hydroxy protecting group, and R6 is benzoyl<br>
(compound IVa") or t-BOC (compound IVb").<br>
Such reaction between compounds of formulas (I") and those of<br>
formulas (Ila") and (lIb") may be accomplished as illustrated in following<br>
reaction Schemes.<br>
I <br><br>
Here, the side chain acid of formula lla" (obtained as described<br>
previously) is dissolved in anhydrous toluene under argon atmosphere at room<br>
temperature. To this stirred solution of the side chain acid is added sequentially<br>
DCC, DMAP and the C7 protected baccatin III of formula I". The resulting<br>
mixture is then heated at about 75°C for 16 hrs. It should be noted that any<br>
other dialkycarbodiimides may be substituted for the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br>
(DCC), with one example being diisopropylcarbodiimide. The solution is then<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature, and next an equal volume of<br>
dichloromethane is added. The combined organics are then washed with cold<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid solution, water, and finally brine. The organic layer is<br>
separated, dried, and reduced under vacuum. The resulting residue is purified<br>
by column chromatography using mixtures of dichloromethane/ethyl acetate or<br>
hexanes/ethyl acetate to afford the pure coupled intermediate taxane of formula<br>
III" or IV".<br>
The process illustrated by Scheme 1 is suited for the preparation<br>
of paclitaxel since the sidechain amino group is protected with a benzoyl group.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention (not illustrated) the process of Scheme<br>
1 is performed with a sidechain having a t-BOC protecting group for the<br>
sidechain amino group, where this embodiment is well-suited for the<br>
preparation of taxotere.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, in preferred embodiments, R3 is H, SPh, OH, OAc<br>
or ethoxyethyl, R4 is H or SPh, and R7 is O-TES or OCOCHCI2. Here, the beta<br>
lactam of formula lIb" (obtained as described previously) and the C7 protected<br><br>
baccatin III is dissolved in anhydrous freshly distilled THF under argon<br>
atmosphere at room temperature. This stirred solution is cooled to 0°C and<br>
added to a suspension of NaH in THF at 0°C. The solution is warmed slowly to<br>
room temperature and maintained at this temperature for 3 hrs. The reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to 0°C and quenched with brine. The reaction mixture was<br>
extracted with dichloromethane and the combined extracts were washed<br>
several times with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product. The crude<br>
product was purified by column chromatography using mixtures of<br>
hexanes/ethyl acetate to afford the pure coupled intermediate taxane of formula<br>
III" or IV" that could be converted to taxol or its analogs. Although this reaction<br>
is illustrated with sodium hydride, in other aspects of the invention the coupling<br>
is performed in the presence of a metal base salts, e.g., a metal<br>
hexamethyldisilazide (e.g., LiHMDS, NaHMDS, KHMDS), or a Lewis acid, e.g.,<br>
boron trifluoride etherate.<br>
The process illustrated by Scheme 2 is suited for the preparation<br>
of paclitaxel since the nitrogen atom of the beta-lactam is protected with a<br>
ben2:oyl (Bz) group. In another embodiment of the invention (not illustrated) the<br>
process of Scheme 2 is performed with the nitrogen atom of the beta-lactam<br>
being protected by a t-BOC protecting group, where this embodiment is well-<br>
suited for the preparation of taxotere.<br>
Additional examples of the coupling of a sidechain to a baccatin-<br>
type compound are shown in the following Schemes 3 and 4. Each of<br>
Schemes 3 and 4 is a separate aspect of the present invention. In these<br>
schemes "R" represents hydrogen or an organic group, e.g., R may be<br>
hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, thiol, or protected thiol; alternatively R may be<br>
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl, where R may be optionally substituted with one or<br>
more of halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, heteroaryloxy, amino, alkylamino,<br>
dialkylamino, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, heteroarylthio, cyano, carboxyl,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl where the alkoxy portion contains 1 to 15 carbons,<br>
aryloxycarbonyl where the aryloxy portion contains 6 to 20 carbon, or<br>
heteroarylcarbonyl where the heteroaryl portion contains 3 to 15 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, "R" is selected as appropriate for the preparation of paclitaxel or<br>
taxotere. DCC is shown as the coupling reagent in Schemes 3 and 4 for<br>
illustrative purpoes, however, other dialkylcarbodiimides may be used in lieu of,<br>
or in combination with, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br><br><br><br><br>
E. Conversion of the compound of formula III or IV to paclitaxel, taxotere, or<br>
an analog thereof<br>
Following synthesis of compounds of formula III" or IV", the same<br>
may then be used as an intermediate for the preparation of paclitaxel, taxotere,<br>
or analogs thereof. For example, the following Scheme 5 illustrates hydrolysis<br>
of the C2'-protected groups and C7-dichloroacetyl or TES to form paclitaxel<br>
under mild conditions, thus not disturbing the ester linkage and various<br>
substituents.<br><br><br>
Here, the C2' protected groups and the C7 protected groups can<br>
be removed to give taxol or its analogs. An analogous process of the present<br>
invention for the preparation of taxotere is shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
