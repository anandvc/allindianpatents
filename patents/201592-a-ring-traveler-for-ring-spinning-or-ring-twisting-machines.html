Ring traveler<br>
The invention relates to a ring traveler for ring spinning or ring twisting machines.<br>
Ring travelers of ring spinning and ring twisting machines are operated at a high running speed (30 to 50 m/s), at which they move on the rings of the corresponding machines. Both the contact surface between the ring traveler and the ring and the contact surface between the ring traveler and the thread are subject to a high level of wear. To increase production, higher running speeds of the ring travelers are required, and to reduce costs a longer service life of the ring travelers is demanded.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a ring traveler for ring spinning or ring twisting machines which is economically more advantageous.<br>
This object is achieved using a ring traveler which has the features of claim 1.<br>
At least on its running surfaces at which it comes into contact with a ring of a ring spinning or ring twisting machine when it is running on the ring, the ring traveler according to the invention has a layer of phosphate which is applied by phosphatizing and the thickness of which is between 0.05 pm and 10  layer thicknesses of below 2 m are preferable, since the surfaces of such layers generally have a lower roughness- However, the ring traveler may also be completely covered by the layer of phosphate.<br>
One advantage of the ring traveler according to the invention is that the running surfaces of the ring traveler which have been provided with a layer of phosphate exhibit a low level of wear, and the ring traveler also has improved sliding properties on the ring, leading to a longer service life of the ring traveler and, moreover, allowing it to be used at higher speeds,<br><br>
Taking into account the particular stresses, such as wear, high temperatures, compressive and tensile stresses, etc., to which the ring traveler is exposed during operation, the base material used for the core of the ring traveler is preferably steel, in particular high-carbon (0.5% - 1.5% C) unalloyed or low-alloy steels, for example. However, other base materials, such as for example ceramic or special plastics, are also conceivable for the core. The phosphatized ring traveler has a very fine crystalline structure with a very smooth surface if cores whose surface has been polished are used for the phosphatizing.<br>
The layer of phosphate which has been applied to the steel core of the ring traveler is preferably a layer of iron phosphate, zinc phosphate or manganese phosphate or a compound thereof with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as for example lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, radium. It should be taken into account that on iron-containing base material, such as for example steel, it is always the case that generally there may also be some iron phosphate and possibly iron oxides present in the layer of phosphate. Layers of phosphate which have a plurality of cations (such as for example iron manganese phosphate or iron zinc phosphate layers) and compounds thereof with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are advantageous, since they have more advantageous properties in terms of roughness, wear and sliding properties compared to layers of phosphate with only one type of cation. Layers of iron zinc phosphate and zinc phosphate combined with alkaline earth metals are particularly advantageous, due to their epitaxial, fine crystalline growth.<br>
Layers of phosphate which are applied to the ring traveler by spraying and by dipping have particularly good properties. Moreover, these two production processes have the advantage of allowing<br><br>
very efficient production of phosphatized ring travelers.<br>
Finely polished ring travelers made from steel with a layer of zinc calcium phosphate which is applied by dipping have exhibited unexpectedly good sliding properties and a low level of wear combined, at the same time, with a very low surface roughness.<br>
The ring travelers with a layer of phosphate described can be used both in spinning mills and in twisting mills. Their good running properties, such as for example good sliding and low wear, are particularly advantageous in conjunction with steel rings, but may also be used on other rings, such as for example on sintered, burnished or coated rings.<br>
Cotton can be processed particularly successfully using the ring traveler according to the invention. The ring traveler provided with a layer of phosphate requires significantly less fiber lubrication, allowing higher spindle speeds and traveler service lives to be achieved even in the absence of lubrication, such as for example during compact spinning. The short fibers of cotton have exhibited highly positive interaction with the layer of phosphate on the ring traveler and have further improved the sliding properties. Fibers, fiber fragments and cotton wax are therefore eminently suitable as fiber lubrication for the ring traveler according to the invention. However, it is also possible to use other fibers, natural or synthetic fibers, with the ring traveler, since it can also be used with additional, externally introduced lubricants (impregnation), such as for example with molybdenum disulfide lubricants.<br>
Further preferred embodiments and uses form the subject matter of further dependent claims.<br>
The phosphatized ring traveler is explained by way of example with reference to Figures 1 to 3, in which, purely diagrammatically:<br><br>
Figs- la<br>
to If	show  various   embodiments   of   ring<br>
travelers; Fig. 2a       shows a ring traveler which has been<br>
phosphatized only in the region of its<br>
running surfaces; Fig. 2b       shows a section on line A-A through the<br>
ring traveler illustrated in Fig. 2a; Fig. 3a       shows  a  completely  phosphatized  ring<br>
traveler, and Fig. 3b       shows a section on line B-B through the<br>
ring traveler illustrated in Fig. 3a. Fig. la and lb show two C-shaped ring travelers 10 as are typically used on T-flange rings. By contrast, Figs. Ic to If show ear-shaped and hook-shaped ring travelers 10' as are used, for example, on inclined-flange rings. Those regions which, during operation, comprise the running surfaces 1' of the ring traveler 10, 10' are each denoted by 1. In the case of the C-shaped ring travelers 10, due to their symmetrical design, both flanks a, b can become the running surface 1', whereas in the case of the ear-shaped or hook-shaped ring travelers 10' the region of the running surface 1 is unambiguously defined by the shape. As can be seen from these examples, a very wide variety of designs of ring traveler 10, 10' and for a very wide variety of ring shapes are suitable for production as phosphatized ring travelers, Naturally, in the region of the running surface 1 an inner side of the ring traveler 10, 10' , which is denoted by 3, has to be made wear-resistant and equipped with good sliding properties and must therefore have a layer of phosphate. Given a suitable thread tension, it may be the case that the ring traveler 10, 10' runs along a ring in a laterally tilted position, and consequently it may be advantageous to provide the two end sides 2 with a wear-resistant surface in the form of a layer of phosphate.<br><br>
Fig. 2a and 2b show, as an example, a C-shaped ring traveler 10 which is coated with a layer of phosphate 5 only in the region of its possible running surfaces 1', and even in these regions only on the end sides 2 and the inner side 3, but not on an outer side 4. Since the ring traveler may become tilted sideways during operation, it is advantageous in the region of the running surfaces 1 for not only the inner side 3 which comes into direct contact with the ring but also the end sides 2 of the ring traveler 10 to be coated with the layer of phosphate 5, although this is not absolutely imperative. In the shoulder region 6 of the ring traveler 10, which does not come into contact with the ring during operation, the ring traveler 10 does not have a layer of phosphate 5. The core 7 of the ring traveler 10, which consists of a base material, such as for example steel, is therefore visible on the outer side 4 and in the shoulder region 6 of the ring traveler.<br>
By way of example. Fig. 3a and 3b show a C-shaped ring traveler 10 which is completely coated with a layer of phosphate. Not only are all sides 2, 3, 4 of the ring traveler 10 in the region of the running surfaces 1 coated, but also all sides of the shoulder region 6 of the ring traveler 10 which does not come into contact with the ring during operation are also coated. Although this is not necessary to achieve a longer service life or to make the traveler suitable for higher running speeds, it is a natural result of coating by dipping or spraying and has a beneficial effect on the guided yarn. Due to the extremely finely structured layer of phosphate, the quality of the yarn does not change compared to nickel-coated travelers (neppiness index etc.). The core 7 of the ring traveler 10 is completely surrounded by the layer of phosphate 5, so that the core 7 is no longer visible from the outside.<br>
To produce the phosphatized ring traveler 10, 10',  it is possible to use known phosphatizing<br><br>
processes which comprise, for example, the following process steps:<br>
 Prior to the phosphatizing, the surface of the core 7 of the ring traveler 10, 10', which consists, for example, of steel, is advantageously finely polished, for example to 1/4 to 1 since the surface of the layer of phosphate 5 applied approximately corresponds to the roughness of the surface of the core 7. To obtain a uniform layer of phosphate 5 on the ring traveler 10, 10', it is advantageous for the surface of the core 7 of the ring traveler 10, 10' to be thoroughly cleaned and decreased prior to the phosphatizing. It is also advantageous for residues of cleaning agent to be removed from the surface of the core 7 after this cleaning operation, since otherwise uneven conditions on the surface of the core 7 lead to an uneven layer of phosphate 5 on the ring traveler 10, 10' .<br>
The layer of phosphate 5 is applied to the ring traveler 10, 10' by dipping the ring travelers 10, 10' into a bath of phosphate solution or by spraying the travelers with such a solution. After the layer of phosphate 5 has been applied to the ring traveler 10, 10', the ring traveler 10, 10' is rinsed again and, if appropriate, dried.<br>
It is known that the thickness and properties of the layer of phosphate 5 are dependent on the parameters selected during production, such as for example the type of cleaning agent, the composition of the phosphate solution, the duration of action and temperature of cleaning and phosphatizing solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
