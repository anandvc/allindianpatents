TITLE: A DEVICE FOR CUTTING FRUITS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for cutting fruits. The fruits are for example lemons and other similar fruits, which are cut by the machine into pieces continuously. The machine has its application preferably in the pickle industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
There are various kinds of cutting and slicing devices are known in the art for cutting lemon and other similar fruits. Some of the conventional devices are manual as well as motor operated.<br>
One of the conventional lemon cutting machines developed by CFTRI, Mysore, comprises a continuous circular cutting device for cutting lemon and other similar fruits. The lemon flows into the pockets of the centralizing disc due to the gradient of the inlet chute. The whole lemon is cut into four pieces when the centralizing disc carrying the lemon moves against the multi-edged cutter. The lemons, cut into four pieces, are dropped on to the outlet chute when the centralizing disc moves away from the multi-edged cutter. The outlet chute discharges the cut lemon into the tray/vessel. The machine can be operated with or without electric power. It has a capacity of cutting lemon at the rate of 100-150 Kg/hr.<br><br>
Another lemon cutting machine developed by Vishwakarma Industries, Kolhapur, India comprises grading means for grading the dumped lemons, into five different sizes. Graded lemons automatically go to the respective units where they are cut into eight pieces of equal size. All the parts are made of stainless except frame. The machine has a capacity of cutting lemon at the rate of 750 Kg/hr, this machine is electric operated.<br>
Yet another device disclosed in the US patent No.5241902, comprises a plurality of blades. An inner guide having a longitudinal axis and an outlet surface, an outer guide having a longitudinal axis and inner and outer surfaces, and a plurality of blade drive means for rotating each of the blades are provided to cut the fruit into the desired shape. Both the inner and outer guides have a plurality of longitudinally extending apertures equal to the number of blades. The apertures are disposed in each guide's outer surface and each aperture in a guide's surface is circumferentially spaced from each other aperture in that guide surface. The apertures in the outer guide are also arranged such that they are aligned with the inner guide apertures. The inner guide is spaced from the outer guide inner surface to form a longitudinally extending annular aperture. The blades are disposed such that a portion of each blade extends through each outer guide aperture and into the annual aperture. The inner guide outer surface and the outer guide inner surface cooperate to guide both whole and broken fruit to the rotating blade portions in the annular aperture so that the fruit can be cut into the desired shape. The outer guide also forms a barrier between the annual aperture and the blade drive means to avoid contamination of the fruit.<br><br>
Still another fruit cutting machine disclosed in US patent No.4777872, comprises an inclined roller-type conveyor belt extending between an open-bottom hopper-type loading stations to an interdigitated rotary knife-type of cutting station served by a comb-type of slice-unloading station. The hopper is open not only upwards and downwards, but also downstream, and the rollers and annually corrugated and made to rotate the hopper immediately downstream of the hopper, so as to load the conveyor belt with a single-depth layer of fruit oriented long axis transversally of the conveyor. At the cutting station, the knives on the upper knife drum spike the fruit in a row and transfer those fruit from the conveyor into the nip between the upper and lower knife drums where the knives on both drums cooperate to slice the fruit. By preference, the knives are disk-shaped with regular patterns of small teeth regularly interrupted by individual larger teeth.<br>
Another fruit cutting device disclosed in US patent No.4, 646,632 comprises an upward-sloping carrying run of an endless conveyor which is made of a succession of rollers mounted to chains entrained about sprockets. The rollers have flexible disk-like fins progressively increasing and decreasing diameter from fin to fin so that the olives tend to settle into pockets and orient with their lengths crosswise of the belt as the rollers are rotated. The belt conveys the olives into a shaft of slicing disks. Olive slices are received between slicing disks and an assisting roller pushes in the remainder of any olive only partially sliced through, except that contact of the slicing disks with any pit still contained in an olive pushes that olive more deeply into a respective inter-roller pocket by flexing the respective roller fins. As separate<br><br>
locations along the conveyor, a comb pulls the olive slices out from between the slicing disks, and the pocket-entrapped pit-containing olives are dislodged.<br>
DISADVANTAGES OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
There are disadvantages associated with conventional devices. One of the main disadvantages is that some of conventional device for cutting fruits are complex in construction and heavy in weight.<br>
Another disadvantage is that some of the conventional device can cause accidents during the manual cutting operation of the fruits.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that some of the conventional fruit cutting devices are complicated and the maintenance thereof is very costly also skilled people are required to maintain the same.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional fruit cutting devices do not produced better quality of fruits slices/cut pieces.<br>
A further disadvantage is that the blades of the conventional fruit cutting devices are not long lasting; they need replacement after particular timing.<br>
Another disadvantage is that conventional fruit cutting devices are complicated and heavy and require more power to operate the same.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that skilled labour is required to operate the machine.<br><br>
