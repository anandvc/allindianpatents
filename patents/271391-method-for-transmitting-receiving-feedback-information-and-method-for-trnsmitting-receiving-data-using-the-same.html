METHOD	FOR	TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING	FEEDBACK<br>
INFORMATION, AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING DATA<br>
USING THE SAME<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
transmitting/receiving feedback information and a method<br>
for transmitting/receiving data using the same, and more<br>
particularly to a method for transmitting/receiving<br>
feedback information such that it acquires accurate channel<br>
information and reduces an amount of overhead, and a method<br>
for transmitting/receiving data to effectively allocate<br>
resources during the initial transmission time.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A transmission end for transmitting data in a mobile<br>
communication system must receive two kinds of channel<br>
information from a reception end.<br>
First channel information from among the two kinds<br>
of channel information is indicative of CSI (Channel State<br>
Information) . The CSI indicates correct information for a<br>
mobile communication channel generated during a specific<br>
time from data transmission to the reception end, and is<br>
directly received from the reception end.<br><br>
Second	channel information is CQI (Channel<br>
Quality Information) which is indicative of the simplified<br>
CSI information. In more detail, if the transmission end<br>
desires to extract transmission (Tx) data and control<br>
information from the received signals after receiving<br>
transmission (Tx) signals from the reception end, the<br>
transmission end requires the CSI, such that distortion<br>
caused by propagation signals received via a radio<br>
frequency (RF) channel can be removed by using the CSI.<br>
Generally, the above-mentioned distortion-removing action<br>
has been called a channel equalization function.<br>
In the case where the reception end receives a<br>
signal from the transmission end, the CQI indicates how<br>
strong the channel carrying the received signal is. In<br>
other words, the CQI indicates the channel intensity of the<br>
signal received in the reception end.<br>
Typically, the CQI has been widely used by a<br>
resource scheduler. The resource scheduler determines<br>
which one of channels can most effectively transmit data<br>
from the transmission end to the reception end.<br>
In the meantime, the CQI indicates average<br>
characteristics of the channel.	Generally, the CQI<br>
averages the CSI according to a predetermined bandwidth,<br>
such that it indicates the average value of the CSI. In<br>
other words, if a channel response is denoted by "H", the<br>
CQI at a specific band "k" can be represented by the<br>
following equation 1:<br><br><br>
where, G is indicative of the number of subcarriers<br>
summed up in the selected band "k".<br>
The CQI is based on an average value of a channel<br>
power. If the CQI is really applied to the transmission<br>
end, this CQI is properly mapped and refined to a set of<br>
range definition according to modulation and channel-coding<br>
scheme, so that the resultant CQI is transmitted to a<br>
destination. This modulated CQI value is called an MCS<br>
(Modulation and Coding Scheme) level.<br>
The CQI indicates which one of MCS levels for use in<br>
a specific band "k" can effectively deliver a data signal<br>
from the transmission end to the reception end without<br>
generating significant problems.<br>
As described above, the modulation-coding scheme is<br>
selectively and/or repeatedly changed according to the CQI<br>
value, and a variety of parameters (e.g., proper Tx power)<br>
can also be regulated by the CQI of the reception end. A<br>
detailed description of the above-mentioned parameters<br>
capable of being regulated by the CQI value has been<br>
described in the 3GPP TS 25.214 V6.7.1 (published on<br>
December 2005).<br><br>
According	to	a conventional	method	for<br>
measuring the CQI value, the CSI is firstly estimated, and<br>
the CQI is then measured.	Indeed, in the case of<br>
estimating the CQI, the above-mentioned Equation 1 based on<br>
the CSI is not used, and a plurality of reception powers of<br>
a specific carrier is summed up, such that the CQI can be<br>
estimated. Therefore, the above-mentioned equation 1 can<br>
be represented by the following equation 2:<br><br>
where, R() is indicative of a reception (Rx) signal<br>
of the i-th subcarrier, P is indicative of an interval<br>
among pilots selected for the CQI estimation, and G' is<br>
indicative of the number of Rx signals selected in the<br>
frequency band interval of the G value.<br>
FIG. 1 exemplarily shows the CQI mapped by the<br>
modulation/coding scheme level.<br>
In more detail, FIG. 1 exemplarily shows a method<br>
for mapping the calculated CQI to a MCS level. In this<br>
case, the mapping method is designed to change the MCS<br>
level whenever the calculated CQI is higher than a<br>
predetermined threshold value.	This threshold value<br>
changes the modulation and channel encoding actions to<br>
others, and a BER (bit error rate), a PER (packet error<br><br>
rate), and a processing performance are crossed at a<br>
specific location corresponding to the threshold value,<br>
such that the specific location is generally set to the<br>
threshold value.<br>
Also, the threshold value changes the MCS level<br>
according to the CQI value, and changes a variety of<br>
parameters such as Tx power of the transmission end. In<br>
more detail, a method for performing the modulation and<br>
channel encoding actions according to the MCS 0 ~ MCS N-l<br>
levels shown in FIG. 1 can be changed according to the<br>
system requirements.<br>
For example, in the case of a channel (i.e., a good<br>
channel) having the CQI value of 30, a coding rate may be<br>
set to 1/2, and a modulation scheme may be set to the 16QAM<br>
method. In the case of a channel (i.e., a bad channel)<br>
having the CQI value of 1, a coding rate may be set to 1/3,<br>
and a modulation scheme may be set to the QPSK method.<br>
And, in association with the mapping relationship<br>
among other parameters, the 3GPP LTE may use a method of<br>
the Tables 7A~7E prescribed in the 3GPP TS 25.214 V.6.7.1<br>
(2005.12) or 3GPP TS 36 series (211,212,213,etc), however,<br>
it should be noted that the scope of the above-mentioned<br>
parameter mapping relationship is not limited to the above-<br>
mentioned example, and can also be applied to other<br>
examples as necessary.<br>
In the meantime, if the CQI reporting period becomes<br>
shorter, a channel variation status can be quickly<br><br>
considered,	however,	an unexpected overhead occurs<br>
during the CQI reporting time. Otherwise, if the CQI<br>
reporting period becomes longer, the channel variation<br>
characteristics cannot be quickly reflected whereas the<br>
amount of overhead is reduced, so that a system performance<br>
is deteriorated. Therefore, as the importance of the<br>
effective usage of radio resources becomes greater, a<br>
variety of techniques for reducing an amount of call-<br>
origination overhead (i.e., outgoing overhead) created<br>
during the CQI transmission have been recently proposed.<br>
FIG. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
general CQI feedback scheme.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the Node-B transmits a common<br>
pilot signal to individual users to measure the downlink<br>
(DL) channel quality at step (1). Each user measures the<br>
channel quality on the basis of the common pilot signal by<br>
exploiting orthogonal pilot sequence property, calculates<br>
the SINR per measuring bandwidth at step (2), and reports a<br>
CQI level index or multiple indices with frequency-<br>
positions corresponding to the calculated SINR to the Node-<br>
B at step (3). The Node-B properly allocates resources<br>
according to channel states of the individual users by<br>
referring to the CQI value at step (4) . Therefore, the<br>
Node-B determines the modulation scheme or the coding rate,<br>
and transmits data to a user equipment (UE) acting as a<br>
destination at step (5).<br><br>
There are a variety of methods for transmitting the<br>
above-mentioned CQI value to the transmission end, and a<br>
detailed description thereof will hereinafter be described<br>
with reference to the annexed drawings.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show a conventional method for<br>
transmitting the conventional CQI value to the transmission<br>
end.<br>
The periodic CQI reporting scheme of FIG. 3 has been<br>
used to report the CQI to the UE, such that it has been<br>
widely used by a plurality of communication standards. In<br>
more detail, the periodic CQI reporting scheme commands the<br>
UE to periodically report the CQI value to the Node-B.<br>
Although the method of FIG. 3 uses four sub-frames as a<br>
reporting period, it should be noted that the reporting<br>
period of the UE is determined by the Node-B and may also<br>
be changed according to status information of the UE. The<br>
configuration of CQI reporting period can be informed<br>
through UL grant or high layer signaling.<br>
According to the periodic reporting scheme, as shown<br>
in FIG. 3, the CQI reporting of each UE is periodically<br>
executed, irrespective of the presence or absence of DL<br>
(downlink) traffic data of each UE. If there are no CQI<br>
report messages on the condition that a specific UE<br>
includes the DL traffic information as denoted by oval-<br>
shaped circles in FIG. 3, and if there is no DL traffic<br>
information under the same condition, the individual UEs<br>
must report the CQI.<br><br>
FIG.	4	shows	a triggered	CQI	reporting<br>
scheme. Differently from the periodic CQI reporting scheme<br>
executed irrespective of data transmission, the above-<br>
mentioned triggered CQI reporting scheme has been designed<br>
to receive the CQI only when data transmission is required,<br>
such that it prevents uplink channel resources from being<br>
unnecessarily wasted.<br>
If the Node-B has data to be transmitted to a<br>
specific UE, the triggered CQI reporting scheme reports the<br>
CQI to the specific UE at intervals of a predetermined<br>
period of time. If data transmission is completed, the CQI<br>
transmission is no longer performed. Therefore, the CQI<br>
reporting is performed only when DL data is allocated to<br>
the specific UE as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
Also, during the above-mentioned CQI transmission, a<br>
variety of CQI formats can be made available and applied to<br>
the following three schemes, a detailed description thereof<br>
will hereinafter be described in detail. The three schemes<br>
are a Full Band CQI reporting scheme, a Best M CQI<br>
reporting scheme, and a Hybrid CQI reporting scheme.<br>
The Full Band CQI reporting scheme transmits CQI<br>
information of all the scheduling bands to the Node-B when<br>
the UE transmits the CQI information to the Node-B. Since<br>
the Full Band CQI reporting scheme transmits CQI<br>
information of all the bands of a channel to the Node-B,<br>
the Node-B can recognize detailed information associated<br>
with the channel bands of the UE. Therefore, the Node-B<br><br>
can effectively use the UE' s channel bands.	However,<br>
provided that the Full Band CQI reporting scheme transmits<br>
the CQI information to all the channel bands, much more<br>
uplink resources are consumed, so that an overall<br>
throughput might be deteriorated.<br>
Next, the Best M CQI reporting scheme will<br>
hereinafter be described with reference to FIG. 5, and the<br>
Hybrid CQI reporting scheme will hereinafter be described<br>
with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
The Best M CQI reporting scheme transmits the CQI of<br>
a specific band profitable to each UE, instead of CQI<br>
information of all the bands, such that it prevents<br>
location information not to be used for the scheduling from<br>
being unnecessarily transmitted. The UE calculates the CQI<br>
values of all the bands (Bl ~ B12) as shown in FIG. 5, and<br>
selects the best M CQI values from among the calculated CQI<br>
values.<br>
FIG, 5 shows an example in which the M value is set<br>
to "4". In FIG. 5, four CQI values (B2, B4, B7 and B9)<br>
having the highest CQI levels are selected from among all<br>
the CQI values (Bl ~ B12) .	In this case, the band<br>
including the selected CQI values is transmitted to an<br>
uplink channel along with the CQI values.<br>
In the meantime, the Best M average CQI reporting<br>
scheme is generally similar to the Best M CQI reporting<br>
scheme. However, differently from the Best M CQI reporting<br>
scheme, the Best M average CQI reporting scheme transmits<br><br>
location information of the selected M bands (B2, B4, B7,<br>
and B9), but it averages the selected M bands and transmits<br>
the average value of the selected M bands. As a result,<br>
the Best M average CQI scheme can slightly reduce the<br>
overhead caused by the CQI transmission. However, the Best<br>
B average CQI reporting scheme may incorrectly calculate<br>
the CQI value of each band, so that the overall scheduling<br>
performance may be deteriorated, resulting in the<br>
occurrence of a reduced throughput.<br>
In the meantime, differently from the above-<br>
mentioned CQI reporting scheme, the hybrid CQI reporting<br>
scheme shown in FIG. 6 generates/transmits the CQI to<br>
recognize the profile of all the bands. All the bands are<br>
hierarchically grouped so that the hierarchically-grouped<br>
bands generate the level. The CQI values of individual<br>
levels are averaged in the grouping units for each level,<br>
so that the average CQI is calculated.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a specific case in which the n value<br>
indicating the hierarchically-grouped level is set to any<br>
one of 1~4.<br>
The CQI value (B13) at the level of n=2 is equal to<br>
the average CQI value at the group band composed of Bl and<br>
B2 at the level of n=l. The CQI value (B19) at the level<br>
of n=3 is equal to the average CQI value at the group band<br>
composed of B13 and B14. Then, the best CQI value of each<br>
level and an index value including the best CQI are<br>
transmitted to the Node-B.<br><br>
In more detail, as shown in the right side of<br>
FIG. 6, if n is set to 1 (i.e., n=l), the CQI value of the<br>
band B4 and an index value including the B4 CQI value are<br>
transmitted to the Node-B. If n is set to 2 (i.e., n=2),<br>
the CQI value of the band B14 and an index value including<br>
the B14 CQI value are transmitted to the Node-B. If n is<br>
set to 3 (i.e., n=3) , the CQI value of the band B19 and an<br>
index value including the B19 CQI value are transmitted to<br>
the Node-B. If n is set to 4 (i.e., n=4), the CQI value of<br>
the band B22 and an index value including the B22 CQI value<br>
are transmitted to the Node-B.<br>
In this case, the CQI value transmitted to the Node-<br>
B is different in level according to individual<br>
transmission times. For example, in the case of the<br>
initial CQI transmission, a CQI value of the n=l level and<br>
band index information including this CQI value are<br>
transmitted to the Node-B. In the case of the next CQI<br>
transmission, a CQI value of the n=2 level and band index<br>
information including this CQI value are transmitted to the<br>
Node-B. As a result, the CQI profile of an overall<br>
transmission band can be estimated.<br>
Presently, the above-mentioned CQI concept has been<br>
applied to a mobile communication system in various ways.<br>
Representative examples of the CQI application are a CDMA<br>
communication technology for mobile phones and a mobile<br>
WiMax technology based on the IEEE 802.16.<br><br>
The CDMA communication technology for mobile phones<br>
does not classify a transmission band, and transmits data<br>
to a destination using a sequence of the whole band, so<br>
that only one value for the whole band is transmitted to<br>
the destination. In this case, there are a variety of<br>
methods for transmitting the single value for the whole<br>
band to the destination, for example, a first transmission<br>
method (e.g., old-version method before CDMA2000) capable<br>
of acquiring a desired performance by controlling only the<br>
power, and a second transmission method (e.g., CDMA2000 or<br>
HSDPA) for directly transmitting correct CQI information to<br>
the destination.<br>
In the case of the CDMA2000 capable of transmitting<br>
correct CQI information, the CDMA2000 technology uses a<br>
differential CQI to chase (or track) the changing CQI. In<br>
other words, the CDMA2000 technology indicates a difference<br>
between a previously-transmitted CQI value and a current<br>
CQI value by 1-bit indicating the increment or decrement.<br>
The OFDM transmission system such as the WiMax<br>
system capable of splitting a wireless transmission band<br>
transmits the CQI as to a channel scheduling subband<br>
discriminated by the scheduler to the transmission end.<br>
In this case, the method for transmitting the CQI to<br>
the transmission end is the periodic CQI reporting scheme,<br>
and is relevant to the Best M average CQI reporting scheme.<br>
This transmission method of the CQI is the band-based CQI<br><br>
reporting scheme, so that a large amount of overhead<br>
unavoidably occurs.<br>
The differential CQI is used to reduce the large<br>
amount of overhead. In this case, a few bits(including<br>
lbit) information having a predetermined option of +delta<br>
dB increment or -delta dB decrement (or MCS level<br>
differential) for each sub-band is transmitted to the<br>
transmission end.<br>
In the case of the conventional CQI reporting cases,<br>
the differential CQI is used to reduce the amount of CQI's<br>
overhead. According to the conventional art, it is assumed<br>
that there is no change in the once-selected band during<br>
the reporting time of the differential CQI. In other words,<br>
the once-determined CQI might be continuously fixed in next<br>
times, and only the CQI variation within the predetermined<br>
band might be reported.<br>
In addition, the CQI variation within the reported<br>
band has been designed to indicate only the<br>
increment/decrement on the basis of a specific value. So,<br>
if the increment or decrement does not occur, i.e., if a<br>
current status is maintained, either the increment<br>
information or the decrement information is transmitted to<br>
a destination, so that the transmission end may<br>
unexpectedly have the loss rather than the gain.<br>
In the case of transmitting the differential CQI, a<br>
differential value between a current signal and a previous<br>
signal indicates only the fixed-range value. Therefore, if<br><br>
a variation range of the CQI value is very large, the<br>
conventional system has difficulty in effectively coping<br>
with the CQI value. The conventional system periodically<br>
transmits the CQI of the whole band to a destination, so<br>
that it indicates whether the differential CQI value is<br>
correctly represented. Unless the variation of the CQI<br>
value is represented by a current encoding scheme, the<br>
conventional system has no method for quickly informing the<br>
transmission end of this situation.<br>
The conventional periodic CQI reporting scheme may<br>
periodically report the CQI value when a corresponding user<br>
is not allocated, or may not report the CQI value even when<br>
the data of the corresponding user is allocated, resulting<br>
in the occurrence of serious problems.<br>
The triggered CQI reporting scheme transmits the CQI<br>
value only when data of the corresponding user is allocated.<br>
However, if several users simultaneously report the CQI<br>
value, several CQI channels are used, so that CQI channel<br>
capacity can be problematic.<br>
In addition, the current CQI reporting schemes have<br>
no CQI information received from the UE during the<br>
transmission of initial data of the system. Also, the<br>
current CQI reporting schemes have no CQI information<br>
received from the UE, even when the user does not transmit<br>
data for a long period of time and then begins to transmit<br>
the data. For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, the above-mentioned<br><br>
first case is called an "initial data transmission<br>
case", and the above-mentioned second case is called "no<br>
available feedback information case" (i.e., no CQI<br>
information case).<br>
In other words, according to the above-mentioned<br>
initial data transmission case, the system must transmit<br>
data of a base station (e.g., Node-B of 3GPP) to a<br>
destination without using the CQI information received from<br>
the UE.	In this case, since the system has no CQI<br>
information of a specific band, it is unable to select an<br>
effective transmission band from among several bands so<br>
that data of the effective transmission band cannot be<br>
transmitted to the destination.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method for transmitting/receiving feedback information, and<br>
a method for transmitting/receiving data using the same,<br>
that substantially obviate one or more problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>

band location at which data can be effectively transmitted,<br>
so that it reduces the number of errors generated during<br>
the tracking time of a variation of the CQI value.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method for diversifying values indicated by<br>
differential information, so that it can more precisely<br>
indicate the variation of differential information.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method for prescribing a specific function<br>
required for transmitting feedback information such as CQI.<br>

and effectively using allocated resources, thereby<br>
reporting feedback information such as CQI values of<br>
several users.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to<br>

It is to be understood that both the foregoing<br>
general description and the following detailed description<br>
of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and<br>
are intended to provide further explanation of the<br>
invention as claimed.<br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
The present invention transmits the CQI value and<br>
the position information of a received band (i.e., Rx band)<br>
as feedback information, and reduces the number of errors<br>
caused when the Node-B tracks a CQI variation in an OFDM<br><br>
system	capable	of transmitting	data	via<br>
divided Tx bands, thereby correctly performing the<br>
scheduling of data.<br>
The present invention allows the differential<br>
information to indicate the increment, decrement, and the<br>
same status between the current signal and the previous<br>
signal, so that it can more accurately track the CQI<br>
information. The present invention can easily change the<br>
range of a differential value according to the variation<br>
speed of the differential information, and the mobility is<br>
gradually emphasized. As a result, the present invention<br>
can be effectively applied to the rapidly-changing channel.<br>
The present invention can reduce an amount of<br>
overhead when the differential value is transmitted<br>
according to the joint encoding scheme, and properly<br>
selects a sequence indicating a necessary function<br>
according to the encoding scheme during the transmission of<br>
feedback information such as CQI, so that it quickly<br>
informs the transmission end of the specific situation as<br>
compared to the conventional art.<br>
If several UEs which desire to transmit feedback<br>
information at a specific timeslot, the Node-B decomposes<br>
the resources allocated for transmission of the feedback<br>
information according to priority information of individual<br>
UEs, so that the allocated resources can be effectively<br>
used.<br><br>
Specifically, if the feedback information to be<br>
transmitted is CQI information, the present invention<br>
calculates the user priority in consideration of CQI<br>
characteristics, so that information necessary for the DL<br>
scheduling can be effectively transmitted via the limited<br>
resources. In this case, the present invention transmits a<br>
differential value of feedback information via each channel,<br>
so that the number of bits of the feedback information to<br>
be transmitted can be reduced, and the number of channels<br>
allocated for transmission of the feedback information can<br>
also be reduced. In this way, the present invention uses<br>
the feedback information with the reduced bits, so that the<br>
Node-B can quickly consider the abruptly-changing channel<br>
status.<br>
The present invention transmits the CQI reporting<br>
request message to a corresponding UE during the initial<br>
data transmission, starts transmission/reception of the DL<br>
data after receiving the CQI value corresponding to the CQI<br>
reporting request message, so that it can stably<br>
transmit/receive data.<br>
The present invention uses the distributed resource<br>
allocation scheme capable of minimizing the influence of a<br>
specific frequency band during the initial data<br>
transmission, so that it can stably transmit/receive data<br>
without generating an additional time delay.<br>
The present invention exchanges information via the<br>
differential CQI value using the default CQI value commonly<br><br>
contained in the Node-B and the corresponding UE, so<br>
that UL resources can be effectively allocated.<br>
The present invention performs the initial DL data<br>
transmission of the Node-B using the default CQI value<br>
created by signals received via the synchronization<br>
estimation process, before the corresponding UE receives<br>
the initial DL data, so that the initial data transmission<br>
can be effectively performed.	Therefore, the present<br>
invention can use the default CQI value as a reference for<br>
calculating the differential CQI value.<br>

[Best Model<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of<br>
which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference indexes will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
It should be noted that most terminology disclosed<br>
in the present invention is defined in consideration of<br>
functions of the present invention, and can be differently<br>
determined according to intention of those skilled in the<br>
art or usual practices. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the above-mentioned terminology be understood on the basis<br>
of all contents disclosed in the present invention.<br><br>
For example, although feedback	information<br>
transmitted from the UE is exemplarily set to the CQI in<br>
the present invention, it should be noted that the scope of<br>
the feedback information is not always limited to the CQI<br>
on the condition that the feedback information can report<br>
location and status information of a data Rx band, so that<br>
other feedback information may also be included in the<br>
scope of the present invention<br>
FIGS. 7~8 show position information of data Rx<br>
bands of individual UEs.<br>
FIGS. 7~8, differently from the CDMA communication<br>
scheme capable of transmitting data via all bands without<br>
dividing the transmission (Tx) band into sub-bands, the<br>
communication scheme is shown, which divides a radio<br>
frequency (RF) band into sub-bands so that it transmits<br>
data via the the sub-bands, and may change a Tx channel of<br>
data applied to each UE according to the lapse of time.<br>
Particularly, provided that a specific system (e.g., a<br>
cognitive radio communication system) for providing a new<br>
communication service by recognizing a currently-unused<br>
frequency band is used, the above-mentioned characteristics<br>
become more serious.<br>
According to the concept and system of FIG. 7,<br>
downlink (DL) data transmitted to each UE is transmitted<br>
over a channel having different bands for each sub-frame,<br>
and the number of allocation channels for transmitting the<br>
DL data is changeable.<br><br>
According	to	the concept and system of FIG. 8,<br>
although the number of allocation channels for DL data<br>
applied to each UE is fixed to a predetermined number, data<br>
applied to each UE is changeable according to sub-frames.<br>
Therefore, if the system transmits a feedback signal on the<br>
assumption that the once-selected band is unchangeable<br>
during the reporting time of either the CQI value or the<br>
differential CQI value, the system may transmit incorrect<br>
information according to a communication scheme (e.g.,<br>
WiMax), dividing the RF band into several sub-bands. In<br>
more detail, the system may transmit incorrect information<br>
according to a specific communication scheme (See FIG. 7 or<br>
8) capable of changing a transmission band of DL data with<br>
time.<br>
Therefore, the frame structure for transmitting<br>
feedback information (e.g., CQI) according to the present<br>
invention can transmit only the CQI value, and can include<br>
band position information indicating the position of a data<br>
reception band in the CQI value, such that it transmits the<br>
resultant CQI value indicating a channel quality of the<br>
above-mentioned band to a destination. Needless to say,<br>
all or either of the above-mentioned band position<br>
information and the channel quality information may be<br>
configured in the form of a differential signal, so that an<br>
amount of a corresponding signal may be decreased.<br>
A method for reporting feedback information of the<br>
data reception channel according to the present invention<br><br>
may basically include two steps for indicating the<br>
differential CQI values, i.e., a first step for reporting<br>
the. band position, and a second step for reporting a<br>
variation of the band CQI value.	The band position<br>
information and the CQI value may be simultaneously<br>
transmitted, or may be transmitted independent of each<br>
other. Also, the above-mentioned method for reporting the<br>
feedback information of the data reception channel may<br>
further include not only different analysis results of the<br>
values indicated by bits of the differential CQI value, but<br>
also an adaptation step thereof.<br>
In order to indicate the differential value using<br>
bits, the system must consider the number of cases and the<br>
available ranges of individual values.	The resultant<br>
number of cases may indicate the number of necessary bits.<br>
There are a variety of methods for indicating the above-<br>
mentioned values, i.e., a separate encoding scheme, and a<br>
joint encoding scheme.<br>
The separate encoding scheme allocates individual<br>
differential values to independent bit sequences. In other<br>
words, differential values are encoded by differential<br>
positions and/or bits to which the differential CQI values<br>
are assigned, and the encoded values are concatenated in<br>
the form of a single signal. If reporting channel capacity<br>
cannot afford the concatenated bit sequences, the<br>
combination of differential position and CQI can be<br>
transmitted separately in a time division-wise. One of<br><br>
aspect for above mentioned separate transmission is to<br>
divide the selected band information into separate<br>
transmission unit. Another aspect of above mentioned<br>
separate transmission is to divide the concatenated<br>
sequence to fit into the reporting channel capacity and the<br>
segmented sequences is transmitted in time division-wise.<br>
In this case, in order to extract information of each band,<br>
the separate encoding scheme must recognize only positions<br>
of corresponding bits, so that the separate encoding scheme<br>
can be easily implemented.	Provided that the number of<br>
cases to be indicated by K-th information is N* , the<br>
number of necessary bits is . In this case,<br>
M<br>
is indicative of a minimum integer number higher than<br>
"x". Therefore, provided that M independent information<br>
must be transmitted, the total number of necessary bits is<br>
denoted by <br>
The joint encoding scheme binds values of several<br>
bands associated with the combination of individual<br>
differential values into a single group, such that it<br>
considers the number of cases under the above-mentioned<br>
situation.	In this case, the combination of all<br>
differential values is assigned to a single bit sequence.<br>
In order to recognize either the position information<br>
corresponding to individual bands or the CQI variation of<br>
the individual bands, the system must check all the bit<br><br>
sequences according to the joint encoding scheme. In<br>
this way, if several values are grouped into a single<br>
structure, the system may indicate the values with the<br>
least number of bits, so that the total amount of overhead<br>
can be reduced. If the number of cases to be indicated by<br>
the K-th value is is Nh, and the number of Nk, values is M,<br>
the total number of cases to be indicated can be<br>
represented by the following equation 3:<br>
[Equation 3]<br><br>
Therefore, the total number of necessary bits can be<br>
represented by <br>
Generally, in the case of comparing the separate<br>
encoding scheme with the joint encoding scheme, the total<br>
number of used bits can be represented by the following<br>
equation 4:<br>
[Equation 4]<br><br>
Next, a method for transmitting the reporting band<br>
position information and/or the CQI value using the above-<br><br>
mentioned encoding scheme will	hereinafter	be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is an exemplary data structure for<br>
transmitting the CQI reporting band position information<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the left side of FIG. 9 shows a<br>
specific case in which differential position information is<br>
indicated by independent bits, and the right side of FIG. 9<br>
shows another case in which the differential position<br>
information is grouped into a single structure, so that the<br>
grouped structure is shown in the right side of FIG. 9.<br>
According to the present invention, if the<br>
differential position information values DP1—DP5 are<br>
combined and transmitted as shown in the right side of FIG.<br>
9, the position information values DP1~DP5 are not<br>
considered to be equal to each other and then combined, but<br>
different weights are assigned to the position information<br>
values DP1~DP5 so that the position information values<br>
DP1~DP5 having different weights are combined with each<br>
other. For example, if col is assigned to DPI,  is<br>
assigned to DP2,  is assigned to DP3, 4 is assigned to<br>
DP4, and 5 is assigned to DP5, the order of the weights<br>
col ~ 5 can be represented by col 
this case, the highest weight is assigned to specific<br>
information indicating position information of a band at<br><br>
which the most recent data is received, so that the<br>
resultant data may be transmitted to a desired destination.<br>
A detailed description of the above-mentioned method<br>
for assigning weights to individual information during the<br>
joint encoding, and combining the assigned resultant values<br>
with each other will hereinafter be described.<br>
If several bit information values are combined and<br>
transmitted, the bit information values may be combined by<br>
either a soft combine scheme or a hard combine scheme. If<br>
the system desires to separately transmit only differential<br>
information using the above-mentioned method for<br>
transmitting feedback information, the left side or the<br>
right side of FIG. 9 may be selectively used to transmit<br>
feedback information.<br>
FIG. 10 is an exemplary data structure for<br>
transmitting information indicating a CQI value according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the left side of FIG. 10 shows<br>
a specific case in which differential CQI values are<br>
indicated by independent bits, and the right side of FIG.<br>
10 shows another case in which the differential CQI values<br>
are grouped into a single structure so that the grouped<br>
structure is shown in the right side of FIG. 10. Needless<br>
to say, in the same manner as in FIG. 9, if the individual<br>
CQI values are grouped into one and the grouped result is<br>
transmitted as shown in the right side of FIG. 10, the<br>
system of FIG. 10 assigns weights to individual bit<br><br>
information and combines the resultant bit information<br>
with each other. In this way, if the system desires to<br>
transmit only specific information indicating only the<br>
differential CQI values, the right side or the left side of<br>
FIG. 10 may be selectively used to transmit the specific<br>
information.<br>
FIG. 11 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for indicating a position variation of a band via<br>
which the UE receives data according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
A band position of a transmission (Tx) channel of<br>
current data and a current CQI value of data transmitted<br>
via the band may be higher than a previous band position<br>
and CQI, may be lower than the same, or may be equal to the<br>
same as necessary.<br>
In the case of transmitting the CQI value via the<br>
differential CQI value, the conventional system is designed<br>
to indicate the increment or decrement of a current signal<br>
in association with a previous signal, so that it is unable<br>
to indicate a specific case in which the current signal is<br>
equal to the previous signal.<br>
Although the error of +1 or -1 in the CQI variation<br>
does not greatly affect the scheduling caused by an overall<br>
CQI level variation, position information of a reception<br>
(Rx) band (hereinafter referred to as Rx band position<br>
information) may encounter a serious problem because the<br><br>
error of +1 and the error of -1 in index information of a<br>
corresponding band may indicate different bands.<br>
Differently from the CQI variation, the position of<br>
the data Rx band is maintained during a predetermined frame<br>
as shown in FIG. 11. Therefore, if the data Rx band<br>
position is indicated by an index indicating a previous Rx<br>
band position, the value of +1, and the value of -1, the<br>
accuracy of the scheduling task may be greatly deteriorated.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a method<br>
for indicating the CQI value and the data Rx band position<br>
signal using the increment value of +1 indicating that the<br>
current signal is higher than the previous signal, the<br>
decrement value of -1 indicating the current signal is<br>
lower than the previous signal, and the same status value<br>
of 0 indicating that the current signal is equal to the<br>
previous signal, so that it can transmit more accurate<br>
feedback information.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the band position may be<br>
maintained during a predetermined frame, and the method for<br>
reporting feedback information according to the present<br>
invention transmits the Rx band position information much<br>
more infrequently than the CQI reporting method, so that<br>
the overhead of uplink resources is reduced. In this case,<br>
it is preferable that the transmission of the band position<br>
information may be limited to only a specific case in which<br>
the position of the Rx band is changed to another position.<br><br>
In the meantime, the increment is indicated by<br>
the value of +1, the decrement is indicated by the value of<br>
and the same status is indicated by the value of 0.<br>
And, the variation of the difference value between the<br>
current signal and the previous signal can be adjusted by<br>
the signal-variation width, and a detailed description<br>
thereof will hereinafter be described with reference to<br>
FIGS. 12 and 13.<br>
FIG. 12 is a graph illustrating a slow variation of<br>
the CQI value according to the present invention. FIG. 13<br>
is a graph illustrating a rapid variation of the CQI value<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In the case of updating the CQI information via the<br>
differential value, the present invention may change the<br>
range of a value indicated by each bit so as to track the<br>
rapid variation of the CQI value.<br>
A horizontal axis of FIG. 12 or 13 indicates a time<br>
(i.e., a sub-frame), and a vertical axis of FIG. 12 or 13<br>
indicates a CQI level at a sub-frame of a corresponding<br>
time. In other words, as shown in FIG. 12, the present<br>
invention is able to track a CQI value of a slowly-changing<br>
channel by the combination of three values -1, 0, and 1.<br>
However, in order to rapidly update the differential value<br>
due to the faster channel-variation speed, the present<br>
invention may perform scaling of the range of the CQI value,<br>
or may exponentially change the range of the CQI value.<br>
There are a variety of mapping methods for use in the<br><br>
above-mentioned scheme, i.e.,a first mapping method, a<br>
second mapping method, and a third mapping method.<br>
The first mapping method is indicative of a mapping<br>
model based on a single parameter (M), so that it<br>
exemplarily indicates a differential value in the form of ..,<br>
-3*M, -2*M, -M, 0, M, 2*M, and 3*M, .... In this case, the<br>
M value is changed in the order of 1, 2, ..., according to<br>
the variation speeds, so that the variation speed of the<br>
differential value can be smoothly adjusted.<br>
The second mapping method is designed to use two<br>
parameters M and P. The second mapping method indicates<br>
the differential value in the form of ..., -M-2P, -M, -P, 0,<br>
M, M+P, and M+2P, .... For example, if the M or P value is<br>
set to "1", the differential value between the M and P<br>
values may be denoted by ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, ....<br>
If the M value is set to "1" and the P value is set to "2",<br>
the differential value between the M and P values may be<br>
denoted by ..., -5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, and 5, ... The above-<br>
mentioned second mapping method has an advantage in that it<br>
indicates a differential value (e.g., values between M and<br>
2M values) within the range of the magnitude M.<br>
The third mapping method may exponentially use four<br>
parameters X, M, P, and N. In other words, the third<br>
mapping method may indicate the differential value in the<br>
form of ..., X+M*P(N*2), X+M*P*"*1', X+M*P(0), 0, -X-M*P(0), -X-<br>
M*P(Nn), and -X-M*P(N*2),.... For example, if the X value is<br>
set to 0, the M value is set to 1, the P value is set to 2,<br><br>
and the N value is set to 1, the differential value may<br>
be denoted by ..., 4, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, and -4, ... For example,<br>
if the X value is set to 0, the M value is set to 2, the P<br>
value is set to 3, and the N value is set to 1, the<br>
differential value may be denoted by ..., 18, 6, 2, 0, -2, -6,<br>
and -18, .... For example, if the X value is set to 2, the M<br>
value is set to 1, the P value is set to 2, and the N value<br>
is set to 1, the differential value may be denoted by ..., 6,<br>
4, 3, 0, -3, ~4, and -6, ...	As a result, the third<br>
mapping method can adjust the interval between a first<br>
differential value at a part close to a central value and a<br>
second differential value at a part distant from the<br>
central value, such that the differential values can be<br>
combined in various ways.<br>
In the case of adjusting the parameters M, P, X, and<br>
N using the above-mentioned mapping models, the range of a<br>
value capable of being tracked by the differential value<br>
can also be adjusted.	In order to change the above-<br>
mentioned models, the part for requesting the CQI may<br>
transmit the variation of the above-mentioned model to the<br>
other party using a specific bit sequence or command, and<br>
may report the differential CQI from the other party.<br>
A method for encoding the CQI value and the band<br>
position information using the differential value denoted<br>
by the aforementioned mapping models, and transmitting the<br>
encoded result will hereinafter be described in detail.<br><br>
FIGS.	14~19 show exemplary channel structures<br>
for transmitting band position information and CQI values<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The recording data of the CQI variation value is<br>
converted into' a bit sequence by the separate encoding<br>
scheme and the joint encoding scheme. In order to estimate<br>
the CQI variation, an index value of a selected band and<br>
the CQI variation value within the selected band must be<br>
tracked. In order to report the above-mentioned situation,<br>
the present invention may request a differential CQI value<br>
for the selected band as shown in FIG. 10. Also, the<br>
present invention may report whether the position of bands<br>
selected at the same transmission time or different<br>
transmission times is unchanged. The reporting scheme may<br>
be executed as shown in FIG. 9.	In the case of<br>
transmitting differential values of the position and CQI<br>
value, the differential values can be transmitted as shown<br>
in FIGS. 9 and In. However, in the case of simultaneously<br>
transmitting the differential values, the differential<br>
values may be combined in various ways as shown in FIGS. 14<br>
to 19.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a specific case in which separately-<br>
encoded differential CQI values are attached to the<br>
differential index values of the selected band, and the<br>
attached result is transmitted to a desired destination.<br>
FIG. 15 shows a modified example of FIG. 14. In<br>
more detail, FIG. 15 shows a specific case in which only<br><br>
differential	position information	is	merged-<br>
encoded. FIG. 17 shows a specific case in which the<br>
differential position information and the differential CQI<br>
value are merged-encoded, respectively, so that the merged-<br>
encoded result is transmitted to a destination. FIG. 18<br>
shows a specific case in which the differential position<br>
information and the differential CQI value are considered<br>
to be only one information, so that the merged-encoding<br>
process is applied to the resultant information. FIG. 19<br>
shows a specific case in which the differential band<br>
position information and the differential CQI value are<br>
merged-encoded in units of sequential bits, and the merged-<br>
encoded result is transmitted to a destination. In this<br>
case, the reception end has an advantage in that it can<br>
track the sequential band position information and CQI<br>
values.<br>
According to the present invention, in the case of<br>
combining the above-mentioned differential CQI information<br>
with the differential position information,	and<br>
transmitting the combined result, the differential CQI<br>
information and the differential position information are<br>
not equally combined with each other, but predetermined<br>
weights are assigned to individual bits of the above-<br>
mentioned information, so that the resultant data having<br>
different weights is transmitted. In this case, in the<br>
case of transmitting individual bit information separately<br>
from each other, in association with the differential CQI<br><br>
value	and	differential position	information<br>
transmitted by the joint encoding scheme, the Node-B<br>
divides the received information into individual bit<br>
information, so that the Node-B can analyze the<br>
differential CQI value and differential position<br>
information on the basis of the divided bit information.<br>
And, the differential CQI value and the differential<br>
position information received by the joint encoding scheme<br>
may also be used to perform the next scheduling.<br>
For example, the band position is unchanged during a<br>
specific sub-frame and only the CQI value of each sub-frame<br>
is changed during the specific sub-frame, the highest<br>
weight is assigned to the CQI value of the most recently<br>
received signal, so that the resultant CQI value including<br>
the highest weight is transmitted to a desired destination.<br>
Therefore, the CQI value of the data Rx band can reflect<br>
the most recent CQI value. In the case of assigning a<br>
weight to Tx data and transmitting the resultant Tx data,<br>
the reception end can extract a differential CQI value and<br>
differential band position information for each bit. In<br>
the case of assigning the highest weight to the most recent<br>
information, and transmitting the resultant data, the<br>
possibility of inaccurately damaging the most recent<br>
differential CQI value and the differential position<br>
information due to signal distortion is lowered during the<br>
transmission time.<br><br>
As described above, the present invention can<br>
properly track the variation of CQI values and the<br>
variation of a selected band. It is obvious to those<br>
skilled in the art that various modifications of the<br>
present invention can be implemented in various ways as<br>
shown in FIGS. 14 to 19.<br>
In the meantime, a special function may be added to<br>
either the above-mentioned joint encoding scheme or the<br>
separate encoding scheme.<br>
The conventional system has been designed to<br>
periodically transmit an overall-band CQI to indicate<br>
whether a differential CQI value is correctly expressed.<br>
As a result, if the abrupt CQI variation cannot be<br>
represented by the current encoding scheme, the<br>
conventional system is unable to quickly inform the<br>
transmission end of this situation.<br>
In order to solve the problems of the conventional<br>
art, in the case where the CQI value and the band position<br>
information cannot be correctly denoted by only the<br>
currently-used differential CQI information due to the<br>
abrupt CQI variation, the present invention provides a<br>
method for defining a special function capable of informing<br>
the transmission end of the above-mentioned case. And, the<br>
special function may be relevant to the method for<br>
indicating the CQI information using the separate encoding<br>
scheme or the joint encoding scheme.<br><br>
A method for defining the special function using<br>
each encoding scheme, and analyzing associated values will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
Firstly, the unary data mapping method for the<br>
separate encoding will be described in detail. The unary-<br>
data mapping method (also called a unidirectional data<br>
mapping method) is designed to define only unidirectional<br>
variation of data in the number of several cases associated<br>
with bit sequences. In more detail, only the positive( + )-<br>
directional variation of data or the negative(-)-<br>
directional variation of data can be defined by the unary<br>
data mapping method. For example, if 1-bit has two numbers<br>
(i.e., 1 and 0) of cases, the numbers of cases are mapped<br>
by the increasing/decreasing permutations as denoted by<br>
{2,1} or {-1,-2}. The two bits (i.e., 2-bit) has the<br>
number of cases denoted by {00, 01, 10, 11}, and the<br>
resultant number denoted by {00, 01, 10, 11} is mapped by<br>
the increasing/decreasing permutations as denoted by<br>
{1,2,3,4} and {-1,-2,-3, -4}.<br>
In this case, a special function may be mapped to a<br>
specific bit sequence as necessary. For example, in the<br>
case of using three bits (i.e., 3-bit), a specific sequence<br>
{111} from among several sequences denoted by 3 bits may be<br>
designed to describe a specific situation incapable of<br>
being explained by a currently-defined mapping scheme. If<br>
the Node-B receiving the differential value composed of 3<br>
bits meets the sequence {111}, the Node-B recognizes that<br><br>
the current CQI cannot be estimated by a corresponding<br>
mapping scheme, so that it requests an overall CQI from the<br>
UE.<br>
If the CQI value is changed in the direction from<br>
the increment to the decrement or in the direction from the<br>
decrement or increment during the above-mentioned unary<br>
data mapping scheme, the UE transmits a sequence for a<br>
special function to the Node-B, so that the Node-B can<br>
recognize that the CQI variation cannot be represented by<br>
the unary data mapping scheme indicating only the<br>
unidirectional increment/decrement. The Node-B receives<br>
the sequence from the UE, generates a command for switching<br>
the increasing/decreasing direction, and transmits the<br>
command to the UE as necessary. Needless to say, the UE<br>
may recognize that the CQI variation cannot be represented<br>
in the increasing/decreasing directions, and may switch the<br>
increasing/decreasing directions to other directions.<br>
Next, the binary data mapping method for the<br>
separate encoding will be described in detail. The binary<br>
mapping method is similar to the unary mapping method,<br>
however, it should be noted that the increment/decrement<br>
actions of data are executed in all of positive/negative<br>
directions, differently from the unary mapping method.<br>
For example, if the binary differential information<br>
is established by 1-bit, the binary differential<br>
information may be indicated by the combination of positive<br>
and negative values, as shown in the combination {1,-1}.<br><br>
If the binary differential information is established<br>
by 2-bit, the binary differential information may be<br>
indicated by the combination {-1,0,1,2} or {-2,-1,0,1} of<br>
positive and negative values.<br>
If the CQI variation cannot be explained under the<br>
current mapping references, the binary data mapping method<br>
may define the special function in the same manner as in<br>
the unary mapping method. For example, in the case of<br>
using the 2-bit, the sequence {11} is established by a<br>
special function, and the Node-B receives the sequence {11},<br>
the binary mapping method determines that the CQI value<br>
cannot be tracked by the current mapping references, such<br>
that the UE requests the overall CQI.<br>
Next, the joint encoding scheme will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail. The joint encoding scheme may have<br>
the combination more easily than the separate encoding<br>
scheme. In other words, in the case of indicating the<br>
combination of individual values, the joint encoding scheme<br>
can represent the bit sequence more effectively than the<br>
separate encoding scheme.<br>
For example, in order to indicate the status {-1, 0,<br>
1}, the separate encoding scheme requires 2 bits. In order<br>
to transmit the status {-1,0,1} three times, the separate<br>
encoding scheme requires 6 bits. However, according to the<br>
joint encoding scheme, the number of total available cases<br>
is 27, and is denoted by 5 bits. Since only 27 sequences<br>
from among 32 sequences denoted by the 5-bit are defined,<br><br>
the joint encoding scheme can define the special<br>
function using the.remaining values.<br>
For example, it is assumed that each differential<br>
value may have three values {-1,0,1} and the value denoted<br>
by {-1,0,1} should be transmitted five times. Under this<br>
assumption, the total number of combinations is denoted by<br>
35=243, and the 243 combinations can be represented by 8<br>
bits. Accordingly, the above-mentioned 24 3 sequences from<br>
among 256 sequences, each of which is represented by 8 bits,<br>
are expressed and the remaining 13 sequences are left. One<br>
of the aforementioned sequences may indicate an overall<br>
failure of the differential mapping. In the case of other<br>
combinations, first CQI information from among the CQI<br>
information may indicate the error, and second CQI<br>
information may also indicate the error as necessary.<br>
In the meantime, in the case of creating a bit<br>
sequence using the real joint encoding scheme, the<br>
following regulations are needed. Provided that the number<br>
of cases of all the differential values (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the case-number of all the differential<br>
values) is set to X, and M differential values must be<br>
transmitted, the total number of cases is denoted by XM, so<br>
that XM cases occur. If the above-mentioned number of<br>
cases is re-defined, the bit sequence value to be<br>
transmitted can be represented by the following equation 5:<br>
[Equation 5]<br><br><br>
where dk is indicative of k-th transmission (Tx)<br>
data.<br>
In the meantime, provided that weights are assigned<br>
to individual differential values according to the joint<br>
encoding scheme and are then combined with the differential<br>
values, Equation 5 can also be represented by the following<br>
equation 6:<br><br>
where a&gt;k is indicative of a weight of the dk value.<br>
If a transmission (Tx) bit sequence is given as<br>
shown in the Equations 5 and 6, the reception end may<br>
decide CQI information on the basis of the L value, may<br>
search for each differential value dk, and may decide the<br>
CQI information on the basis of the retrieved differential<br>
value dk. If the CQI information is decided by the joint-<br>
encoding value (L) , it is preferable that the highest<br>
weight is assigned to differential value information<br>
relevant to the most recently-received data, so that the<br>
channel status can be properly decided.	The above-<br>
mentioned case may be effectively applied to a specific<br><br>
case in which a CQI value indicating the final channel<br>
status of a corresponding band is the most important matter,<br>
because the band position is unchanged in the above-<br>
mentioned case, however, it should be noted that the scope<br>
and spirit of the present invention is not limited to only<br>
this example, and can also be applied to other examples as<br>
necessary.<br>
A method for searching for the dk value<br>
corresponding to each differential value from among the<br>
joint-encoding value (L) can be performed as follows.<br>
Firstly, in the case where no weight is assigned to each<br>
differential value information and the differential values<br>
having no weights are combined with each other, this<br>
situation can be represented by the following equation 7:<br><br>
where, mod(x,y) is indicative of an operator for<br>
calculating a remainder created when "x" is divided by "y".<br>
also, if the joint-encoding value (L) is received on<br>
the condition that weights are assigned to individual bit<br>
information as shown in Equation 5, the d* value can be<br>
calculated by the following equation 8:<br><br>
[Equation 8]<br><br>
In this way, if the joint encoding scheme is used as<br>
described above, the number of Rx data bits can be reduced,<br>
and an amount of overhead of uplink resources can also be<br>
reduced. The highest weight is assigned to the final<br>
differential value during the joint encoding operation, so<br>
that the possibility of damaging the final differential<br>
value during the transmission time is minimized.<br>
Needless to say, the method for analyzing the<br>
feedback information according to the present invention<br>
acquires information indicating a data Rx band position<br>
from feedback information entered by the UE, and acquires<br>
CQI information at the data Rx band. And, if the band<br>
position information and the CQI value are represented by<br>
the differential values as described above, the<br>
differential values are compared with previous values, so<br>
that the perfect band position information and the perfect<br>
CQI information can be acquired.<br>
In the meantime, the above-mentioned channel<br>
structure and an apparatus for implementing the method for<br>
transmitting feedback information using the channel<br>
structure will hereinafter be described in detail.<br><br>
FIG. 20 is a block diagram	illustrating	an<br>
apparatus for transmitting feedback information according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, Tx data of the Node-B is<br>
received via an antenna, and is received in the controller<br>
1001 via a duplexer. The controller 1001 according to the<br>
present invention may extract information (pk) indicating a<br>
Rx band position and a CQI value (rk) of the corresponding<br>
band from the Rx data (R). The controller 1001 transmits a<br>
control signal (c) to the calculator 1003 and the encoder<br>
1004, so that it controls operations of the calculator 1003<br>
and the encoder 1004.<br>
The information (rk and pk) extracted by the<br>
controller 1001 may be applied to the buffer 1002 and the<br>
calculator 1003.	The buffer 1002 stores received<br>
information (rk and pk) , so that it may output information<br>
(rk_i and pk-i) stored after 'the lapse of a single frame<br>
(i.e., 1-frame) to the calculator 1003.<br>
Needless to say, if the CQI value used as feedback<br>
information is not continuously transmitted in the same<br>
manner as in the CQI transmission case activated only when<br>
the presence of Rx data is decided, corresponding<br>
information can be stored in the buffer 1002 until the next<br>
feedback information is transmitted. For the convenience<br>
of description and better understanding of the present<br>
invention, the buffer 1002 may store a plurality of<br>
information pieces during the interval of the 1 frame, and<br><br>
a	detailed	description thereof will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
Next, the calculator 1003 receives the information<br>
values (rk-1 and Pk-1) stored during a frame period<br>
corresponding to the 1-frame interval, and receives new<br>
information values (rk and p&gt;) from the controller 1001,<br>
such that it can calculate differential values (dvk and<br>
dpk) of the received information values. In this case, as<br>
can be seen from FIG. 20, the calculator 1001 calculates a<br>
differential value of the band position information and a<br>
differential value of the CQI value. However, the band<br>
position information having a relatively-low variation<br>
determines whether the data Rx band position is changed<br>
less times than in the CQI value information. Preferably,<br>
if the controller 1001 determines whether the data Rx band<br>
position is changed or not, and informs the calculator 1003<br>
of the variation of data Rx band position via the control<br>
signal (c) , the differential calculation process reduces<br>
the amount of Tx signal only when the data Rx band position<br>
variation is notified to the calculator 1003 via the<br>
control signal (c), so that the amount of overhead can also<br>
be reduced.<br>
Thereafter, the differential values (dvn and dpk)<br>
generated by the calculator 1003 may enter the encoder 1004.<br>
The encoder 1004 receives the differential band position<br>
information (dpk) and the differential CQI value (dvk)<br>
according to the control signal (c) of the controller 1001,<br><br>
encodes the received data (dpk and dvk) in various ways<br>
as shown in FIGS. 14 to 19. If required, a specific<br>
sequence performs data mapping for a special function, and<br>
may generate Tx data (L) . The Tx data (L) is transmitted<br>
to the Node-B via the antenna after passing through the<br>
duplexer.<br>
In the meantime, the selected CQI reporting scheme<br>
for determining the CQI reporting on the basis of the UE<br>
priority information will hereinafter be described in<br>
detail. In this case, the UE priority is determined on the<br>
basis of a channel variation status of UEs, a CQI<br>
transmission time interval, and a throughput in a wireless<br>
communication environment.<br>
In order to effectively use the limited radio<br>
resources, the selected CQI reporting scheme considers a<br>
channels status, a CQI transmission time, and a data rate<br>
when determining the UE priority reporting the CQI, so that<br>
it transmits the CQI in descending numerical orders of the<br>
UE priority. As a result, the selected CQI reportint<br>
scheme reduces the CQI overhead, can effectively use the<br>
resources, and sufficiently considers a changing channel<br>
status via the limited CQI reporting channel using a<br>
differential CQI value, so that the system performance is<br>
improved.<br>
FIG. 21 is a block diagram illustrating a method for<br>
selecting UEs going to report CQI values according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 21, in order to measure a<br>
channel quality of downlink (DL) data, the Node-B transmits<br>
a common pilot signal to individual UEs of users, and each<br>
UE measures a SINR of the received signal and determines a<br>
CQI index indicating a channel quality level of downlink<br>
(DL) data. Each UE transmits this CQI value in an uplink<br>
direction to effectively report the CQI value, so that the<br>
resources can be maximally used.<br>
According to the present invention, the system of<br>
FIG. 21 transmits the CQI value only when user data to be<br>
transmitted to a DL traffic path exists, so that it can<br>
reduce the number of unnecessary reporting times. If there<br>
are several users who desire to transmit data at the same<br>
time, the Node-B selects a specific UE acting as the CQI<br>
transmission target according to the priority information<br>
determined by a variety of factors, so that it reduces the<br>
number of channels used for CQI transmission. And, the<br>
system firstly transmits the CQI of the high-priority user<br>
according to the channel status and condition of the users,<br>
so that it solves the CQI overhead problems and improves<br>
the performance.<br>
In the meantime, the priority of UEs (i.e., the UE<br>
priority)	can be determined by the	following<br>
characteristics, as represented by the following equation<br>
9:<br>
[Equation 9]<br><br><br>
where, "i" is indicative of index information of UEs,<br>
VVQI is indicative of the degree of a difference between a<br>
CQI value of a previous sub-frame of the i-th UE and a CQI<br>
value of a current sub-frame of the i-th UE, ∆tcot indicates<br>
how long the transmission time interval between a previous<br>
CQI value of the i-th UE and a current CQI value is, and<br>
SINR, is indicative of the degree of the SINR value of the<br>
i-th UE. And, deterro^ is indicative of the degree of<br>
errors of Rx data of the i-th UE, {T, <treq indicates that></treq>
the throughput of the i-th UE is lower than that of the<br>
system, and Rt is how tall the data rate of the i-th UE is.<br>
If the above-mentioned characteristics increase, the<br>
priority of each UE also increases.<br>
Therefore, the priority function P (xl, x2,..., xn) shown<br>
in Equation 9 is configured in the form of an increasing<br>
function for each characteristic parameter (xi). In order<br>
to construct the characteristic function, a specific weight<br>
is multiplied by each characteristic parameter according to<br>
system requirements, as represented by the following<br>
equation 10:<br>
[Equation 10]<br><br><br>
where  — b indicate the weights assigned to<br>
individual parameters.<br>
As described above, the UE having the priority<br>
determined by Equation 9 or 10 is selected as a CQI<br>
reporting object by the Node-B. In this case, the UEs are<br>
selected as the CQI reporting objects in descending<br>
priority orders. For this purpose, the Node-B transmits a<br>
CQI transmission request message to high-priority UEs<br>
selected as the CQI reporting objects, and the CQI<br>
transmission request message is transmitted to the UEs<br>
along with Tx data of each UE.<br>
In the meantime, there is no need to consider all<br>
the characteristic parameters shown in Equation 9 or 10.<br>
Only some characteristic parameters may be considered<br>
according to weights multiplied by characteristic<br>
parameters for the system requirements.<br>
Generally, if feedback information to be transmitted<br>
is a CQI of a DL channel, the most important matters of the<br>
above-mentioned characteristic parameters are the values of<br>
VVQI and 	∆tCQT . In this case, VVQI is indicative of a<br>
difference between a CQI value of a previous frame and a<br>
CQI value of a current frame, and ∆tCQT is indicative of a<br>
time interval between the CQI value of the previous frame<br>
and the CQI value of the current frame. The present<br><br><br>
invention can determine the priority	of	UEs	by<br>
considering only the above-mentioned two values VQI and<br>
AtCQI .<br><br>
In the meantime, in order to more correctly indicate<br>
the DL-channel quality, there is proposed a method for<br>
sequentially assigning weights in the order of increasing-<br>
subscripts of the weights coi~a&gt;&amp;.<br>
FIG. 22 shows a method for sequentially selecting<br>
UEs reporting the CQI using the method of FIG. 21 according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 23 — 26 show detailed concepts of the<br>
sequential selection method shown in FIG. 22 according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 22 and 23~26, the present<br>
invention basically assumes that the CQI transmission<br>
request occurs only when data to be transmitted by the UE<br>
exists. And, it is assumed that each UE receives two<br>
uplink channels (e.g., HD-SICH) for CQI transmission from<br>
the Node-B. In order to easily recognize the relationship<br>
between data and CQI of individual UEs, the DL traffic data<br>
(See upper part of FIGS. 22 and 23 — 26) and the CQI traffic<br>
data (See lower part of FIGS. 22 and 23~26) of the same UE<br><br>
are denoted by the same oblique lines, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 22 and 23~26.<br>
Referring to FIG. 23, the Node-B transmits the CQI<br>
transmission request to UE3 and UE4, each of which has the<br>
DL traffic data in the two allocated UL channels at step ®.<br>
Provided that the VyQK value is not high due to the rapidly-<br>
changing channels of other UEs at step ©, UE1 and UE2 are<br>
selected as the transmission targets by the ktCQI value.<br>
Next, if the UE1 has a low SINR at step ©, the UE1<br>
is selected by the SINRi value. If unexpected errors occur<br>
in Rx data of the UE4, the UE4 can also be selected by the<br>
det_errori value. In the meantime, since the UE having<br>
data in the DL traffic information is only the UE1, only<br>
the UE1 is selected as the CQI reporting object at step ©.<br>
The UE which is going to transmit the CQI at the<br>
above steps is selected by the Equations 9 and 11.<br>
Generally, the number of selected UEs is equal to the<br>
number of channels allocated for CQI transmission. If the<br>
number of UEs, each of which has Rx data in the DL traffic,<br>
is less than the number of allocated channels, the Node-B<br>
transmits only the CQI of the UE having data to be received.<br>
During the initial selection step, the Node-B may select<br>
the UE, which is going to transmit the CQI, from among<br>
several UEs in consideration of channel capacity for CQI<br>
transmission of each UE. During the initial selection step,<br>
the Node-B selects all of UEs, each of which has priority<br><br>
higher than a predetermined priority value. Thereafter,<br>
if the Node-B has difficulty in reporting the CQI values of<br>
all the selected UEs in consideration of the CQI reporting<br>
scheme and channel capacity, the Node-B may transmit the<br>
CQI transmission request to only some UEs instead of all<br>
the selected UEs.<br>
Referring to FIG. 24, if unexpected errors occur in<br>
Rx data of the UE3 at step ©, the UE3 is selected by the<br>
det_errori value, and at the same time the UE4 is selected<br>
by the AtCQti value. Next, the UE2 is selected by the AtCQI<br>
value at step©. Provided that the DL channel of the UE3<br>
is abruptly changed and errors occur in Rx data of the UE1,<br>
the weight multiplied by the VyQI
weight multiplied by the det_errorj. value, so that the UE3<br>
is selected. Needless to say, the above-mentioned cases<br>
has been disclosed as examples of the present invention,<br>
and the weight multiplied by each parameter may also be<br>
changed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 25, provided that all the UE<br>
channels are abruptly changed at step ©, individual UEs<br>
have the same VVQl) value, so that the UE3 and the UE4 are<br>
selected by the Atc value. Thereafter, the individual UEs<br>
have the same VVQIi value at step ®, so that the UE1 is<br>
selected if the throughput of the UE1 is less than a<br>
requested throughput. And, if the channel of the UE3 is<br>
abruptly changed, the UE3 is selected by the VVQU value.<br><br>
Thereafter,	the	Node-B selects the UE1 having the<br>
abruptly-changing channel and the UE2 having a long Tx-time<br>
interval at step ®. In this way, if the UE is selected as<br>
a CQI transmission target, the Node-B transmits the CQI<br>
transmission request rressage to the UEs, so that the CQI<br>
may be reported to individual UEs according to the<br>
allocated band and capacity.<br>
Finally, referring to FIG. 26, if the channels of<br>
all the UEs are abruptly changed, the UE3 and the UE4 are<br>
selected as the CQI reporting objects by the AtCQl value at<br>
step ©. The Node-B selects the UE1 and UE4 receiving data<br>
at step ©. If all the channels are not abruptly changed,<br>
the Node-B selects the UE2 and the UE4 as the CQI reporting<br>
objectts by the &amp;tCQI value at step ©.<br>
According to the concepts of FIGS. 22 and 23 to 26,<br>
the Node-B transmits the CQI request message to only the UE<br>
having Rx data in the DL traffic information. In the case<br>
of determining the individual priority, weights are<br>
sequentially assigned to the priority function of Equation<br>
10 in the order of subscripts attached to the weights.<br>
However, differently from the concepts of FIGS. FIGS. 22<br>
and 23 to 26, it should be noted that other examples of the<br>
present invention can be readily implemented by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
If there are several UEs capable of transmitting the<br>
CQI using the method for transmitting the feedback<br><br>
information, a differential CQI value may be transmitted<br>
to the UEs, and a detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 27 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for reporting the CQI using a differential value<br>
when the number of selected UEs is a plural number<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The system of FIG. 27 is based on the CQI reporting<br>
scheme for reporting the priority information of individual<br>
UEs, and employs a differential CQI value to effectively<br>
use radio resources, so that it reduces the number of bits<br>
of the CQI information. According to the concept of FIG.<br>
27, in the case of using the differential value under the<br>
abruptly-changing channel situation, CQI information of UEs<br>
which desire to transmit data can be effectively<br>
transmitted via a limited channel, resulting in an<br>
increased system performance. The above-mentioned scheme<br>
is called a SDV (Selection Differential Value) CQI<br>
reporting scheme, and a detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
The SDV CQI reporting scheme measures the SINR of a<br>
received signal (Rx signal) in the same manner as in the<br>
above-mentioned selection CQI reporting scheme, and<br>
measures the DL-channel status on the basis of the measured<br>
SINR of the Rx signal.	The priority is determined<br>
according to the measured CQI value and the UE condition.<br>
If there are several UEs which are going to transmit the<br><br>
CQI	according	to	the priority,	the	Node-B<br>
transmits the CQI using the differential value indicating a<br>
difference between the previous CQI value and the current<br>
CQI value. The SDV CQI reporting scheme can reduce the CQI<br>
overhead because the UE for selectively transmitting the<br>
CQI is determined according to the priority information,<br>
and at the same time it reports the differential CQI value<br>
so that it reduces the number of information bits. As a<br>
result, CQI of several UEs can be effectively transmitted<br>
to a destination without increasing an additional CQI<br>
transmission channel. There are a variety of schemes for<br>
implementing the above-mentioned scheme, and detailed<br>
description thereof will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIGS. 28~30 are conceptual diagrams illustrating<br>
methods for reporting the CQI using a differential value<br>
when the number of selected UEs is a plural number<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 28, the Node-B equally allocates<br>
the same resources to individual CQI reporting channels.<br>
Needless to say, the UEs receiving the CQI transmission<br>
channel are selected as the CQI transmission targets in<br>
consideration of their priority information. According to<br>
the concept of FIG. 28, resources are equally allocated to<br>
the selected UEs, so that the CQI values having the same<br>
accuracy are transmitted to the selected UEs.<br>
Referring to FIG. 29, some UEs having low priority<br>
have no opportunity for transmitting data according to the<br><br>
CQI variation, however, the remaining UEs having high<br>
priority divide resources into sub-units and transmit the<br>
data via the divided resources.<br>
UEs having priority higher than a predetermined<br>
reference value are selected as the CQI transmission<br>
targets according to the priority function shown in<br>
Equations 9 to 11.	However, if the CQI cannot be<br>
transmitted to all the selected UEs according to the<br>
differential values used for CQI transmission, the concept<br>
of FIG. 29 excludes some UEs from the CQI transmission<br>
targets in consideration of channel transmission capacity<br>
according to a predetermined condition. In this case, the<br>
predetermined condition indicates a difference between a<br>
CQI value of a previous transmission frame and a CQI value<br>
of a current frame on the basis of the priority information<br>
indicating whether the reception end has correctly<br>
recognized the previous CQI value.	In other words,<br>
according to a first selection step for selecting the UEs<br>
as the CQI reporting objects, the Node-B determines whether<br>
the priority of each UE is higher than a predetermined<br>
value, and selects all the UEs, each of which has the<br>
priority higher than the predetermined value, as the CQI<br>
reporting objects. Thereafter, at a second selection step,<br>
the Node-B re-selects the UE used as the CQI reporting<br>
objectt in consideration of channel capacity.<br>
The priority considered at the first selection step<br>
may be equal to the priority considered at the second<br><br>
selection step, however, the objects considered at first<br>
and second steps are different from each other, so that<br>
different weight may be assigned to individual parameters.<br>
Finally, according to the concept of FIG. 30, UEs,<br>
which are selected according to the priority information<br>
and share the CQI transmission channel, are allocated a<br>
different amount of resources. In this case, the Node-B<br>
can more precisely transmit the CQI information of the<br>
high-priority UE.<br>
Exemplary methods of the above-mentioned SDV CQI<br>
reporting scheme will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 31 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for sequentially selecting UEs reporting the CQI<br>
using a differential value when the number of selected UEs<br>
is a plural number according to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 32~33 show detailed concepts of the<br>
sequential selection method shown in FIG. 31 according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 31 to 33, the Node-B reports the<br>
CQi only when DL data to be transmitted exists. If the CQI<br>
information of at least two UEs is transmitted at the same<br>
time, the concept of FIGS. 31 to 33 assumes that a<br>
differential value between the CQI value of a previous sub-<br>
frame and the CQI value of a current sub-frame should be<br>
reported. In order to easily recognize the relationship<br>
between data and CQI of individual UEs, the DL traffic data<br>
(See upper part of each drawing) and the CQI traffic data<br><br>
(See lower part of each drawing) of the same UE are<br>
denoted by the same oblique lines, as shown in FIGS. 22 and<br>
23~26.<br>
Referring to FIG. 32, if the channels of all users<br>
are not abruptly changed at step ®, transmission of the<br>
CQI values of the UE2 and UE4 is selected by the VVQh value.<br>
In this case, since several users are selected as CQI<br>
transmission targets, the CQI values of the individual<br>
users should be transmitted as differential values.<br>
Next, if the channel of the UE2 is abruptly changed<br>
at step ©, the UE2 is selected by the VVQI value. In this<br>
case, the number of UEs used as the CQI transmission<br>
targets is not a plural number, so that the Node-B does not<br>
transmit the differential value, and requests transmission<br>
of all CQI values of the current sub-frame. Thereafter,<br>
if a Rx SINR of the UE3 is low at step 
requests the UE3 to transmit the CQI by the SINR± value.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 33, if channels of all UEs<br>
are abruptly changed at step ®, the CQI information of all<br>
users is transmitted as a differential value. In this case,<br>
an amount of information for CQI transmission is reduced,<br>
so that the CQI differential value transmitted from each UE<br>
has bits of less than 1/4 as compared to bits required for<br>
the other case in which all the CQI information of the<br>
current sub-frame.	As a result, although the CQI<br>
transmission channel is not additionally transmitted, all<br><br>
the CQI values of the UE1, UE2, UE3, and UE4 can be<br>
transmitted. Thereafter, if unexpected errors occur in the<br>
Rx data of the UE3 at step ©, the Node-B can transmit only<br>
the CQI value of the UE3 according to the det_errorx value.<br>
If the throughput of the UE1 is lower than a required<br>
throughput, the CQI value of the UE1 can be transmitted by<br>
the Ti 
high, the CQI values of the UE2 and UE4 are transmitted as<br>
a differential value by the VVQI value. If the SINR value<br>
of the UE4 is low, the CQI values of the UE2 and UE4 are<br>
transmitted as a differential value by the SINRx value.<br>
The above-mentioned steps have exemplarily disclosed<br>
the method for selecting UEs used as the CQI transmission<br>
targets, and calculating a differential value when several<br>
selected UEs exist, so that the capacity of the allocated<br>
CQI transmission channel and the amount of differential<br>
value information can be changed in various ways. However,<br>
according to the method for calculating the CQI<br>
transmission channel capacity and the differential value,<br>
the degree of decreasing information amount may be unique<br>
for each system, and the decreasing information may<br>
maintain a specific level for a predetermined period.<br>
Based on the above-mentioned explanation, the<br>
general trigged CQI reporting scheme can be defined as<br>
follows.	The factors to be considered for the CQI<br>
reporting can control the CQI reporting scheme of each UE<br><br>
by determining whether the transmission end has correct<br>
CQI information.<br>
If the channel variation is not high at a previous<br>
reporting time and a current reporting time, a<br>
corresponding UE may be excluded from the CQI reporting<br>
objects at the current CQI reporting time. Also, if the<br>
channels of several UEs are abruptly changed at the<br>
previous and current reporting times, the present invention<br>
must correctly transmit a large amount of UE information to<br>
the transmission end.	For this purpose, the present<br>
invention excludes a specific UE which has not established<br>
as the CQI reporting objectt from all the UEs, and must<br>
distribute the CQI reporting channel resources to the<br>
remaining UEs.	This distribution method may equally<br>
distribute the channel resources to individual UEs, or may<br>
allocate different-amount resources to the UEs in<br>
consideration of the characteristics (e.g., priority or<br>
QoS) of the UEs.	If the CQI channel resources are<br>
insufficient, the accuracy of the CQI reported by each UE<br>
may be decreased, and an overall CQI reporting and a<br>
differential CQI reporting can be made available.<br>
FIG. 34 is a block diagram illustrating<br>
characteristics of a Node-B according to another preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 34, in order to perform the<br>
feedback-information requesting method and the feedback-<br>
information receiving method according to the present<br><br>
invention,	the	Node-B includes	the	priority<br>
decision unit 1201, the UE selection unit, and the<br>
feedback-information transmission request unit 1203.<br>
If there are several UEs which are going to transmit<br>
feedback information at a specific timeslot, the priority<br>
decision unit 1201 determines the priority of the UEs. The<br>
above-mentioned priority decision may be performed by a<br>
variety of parameters shown in FIG. 34. The parameters do<br>
not have the same importance, so that the system of FIG. 34<br>
may further include the weight assignment unit 1201a for<br>
assigning different weights according to importance<br>
information of the parameters. The weights a&gt;y ~ ab may be<br>
set to "0" if some parameters are excluded from parameters<br>
to be considered.	Individual parameters to which<br>
differential weights are allocated are summed up by the<br>
adder 1201b, the priority information is completed as<br>
denoted by Priorityhigh.<br>
The UE selection unit 1201 receiving the above-<br>
mentioned priority information selects UEs used as the CQI<br>
reporting objects in consideration of the received priority<br>
information. In this case, the UE selection unit 1201<br>
considers the allocation degree of the UL channel to be<br>
used for the CQI reporting of individual UEs, and selects<br>
UEs which are going to report the CQI.<br>
In more detail, the Node-B of FIG. 34 determines<br>
constituent modules of the UE selection unit 1201. If the<br>
priority is higher than a predetermined value, the Node-B<br><br>
selects a corresponding UE as	the	priority	CQI<br>
reporting object, and may exclude some UEs from selected<br>
UEs according to channel condition information. The UE<br>
selection unit 1210 considers not only the priority<br>
information but also the UL channel allocation information<br>
at a single step, and may select the CQI reporting object<br>
according to the considered result.<br>
If the UE which is going ro transmit feedback<br>
information such as CQI is selected, information of the<br>
selected UE is transmitted to the feedback-information<br>
transmission request unit 1203. The feedback-information<br>
transmission request unit 1203 transmits a CQI transmission<br>
request to the selected UE selected as the CQI transmission<br>
object.-<br>
The feedback-information transmission request unit<br>
1203 may include a resource-allocation adjusting unit 1203a<br>
and a CQI request signal generator 1203b. The resource-<br>
allocation adjusting unit 1203a determines whether the UL<br>
channel, via which each UE generating the CQI transmission<br>
request can report the CQI, will be equally allocated to<br>
individual UEs, and determines whether resources<br>
proportional to the priority information of the UEs will be<br>
allocated.	The CQI-request signal generator 1203b<br>
generates the CQI request signal according to the resource<br>
allocation information. The generated CQI request signal<br>
is transmitted to the selected UEs by the transmitter (not<br>
shown), and the receiver (not shown) receives the CQI<br><br>
transmitted from the UEs having received the CQI<br>
request signal.<br>
In the meantime, a method for effectively reporting<br>
initial CQI information to solve the problems of the<br>
conventional art will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
In this case, the conventional problem occurs when the UE<br>
used as a transmission object has no available CQI<br>
information during the transmission of initial DL data.<br>
FIG. 35 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for delaying data transmission until the CQI is<br>
received from the UE, and transmitting the delayed result<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 35 shows an exemplary case in<br>
which the Node-B has data to be transmitted via the<br>
downlink channel and transmits data after the lapse of a<br>
long idle time, so that no CQI is received from the UE. In<br>
brief, the embodiment of FIG. 35 has no information<br>
available for recognizing the DL-channel status. In this<br>
case, as can be seen from FIG. 35, the Node-B transmits the<br>
CQI reporting request to the UE at the time (t) , receives<br>
the CQI message from the UE, and transmits data to the UE<br>
at the (t+1) time. As a result, Tx data may be delayed.<br>
However, the 3GPP LTE scheme consumes the time of about<br>
0.5ms from the CQI reporting request time of the Node-B to<br>
the CQI reception time of the Node-B. The time of about<br><br>
0.5ms is much shorter than a latency time of most traffic<br>
data.<br>
If the Node-B waits for a feedback message of the<br>
initial CQI, receives the CQI reporting message from the UE,<br>
and allocates DL resources on the basis of the received CQI<br>
message, the embodiment of FIG. 35 can more effectively<br>
manage resources according to a DL-channel situation<br>
recognized by the CQI. The time delay of "+1" shown in FIG.<br>
35 indicates the above-mentioned delay. In the case of the<br>
above-mentioned 3GPP LTE, it is preferable that the time<br>
delay may be set to 1 sub-frame.<br>
The above-mentioned scheme is called a delayed<br>
initial data transmission scheme. The delayed initial data<br>
transmission scheme will be described in detail from the<br>
viewpoint of data sequences to be transmitted at individual<br>
steps.<br>
FIG. 36 shows the preferred embodiment of FIG. 35<br>
from the viewpoint of a data stream to be transmitted<br>
according to individual steps according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 36, if data to be transmitted via<br>
the DL exists, a storage unit for storing the data is<br>
required. FIG. 36 shows a method for storing the DL<br>
transmission data in the buffer.	In this way, the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 36 determines whether the buffer stores<br>
CQI information available for a corresponding DL channel to<br>
transmit DL data. If the above-mentioned CQI information<br><br>
is	pre-guaranteed,	the embodiment	of FIG.	2 6<br>
allocates the DL resources according to the general<br>
scheduling, and transmits data via the allocated DL<br>
resources.	However, in the case of the initial data<br>
transmission (e.g., if data is initially transmitted via a<br>
corresponding DL channel, or- if data is transmitted after<br>
the lapse of a long idle time), the embodiment of FIG. 36<br>
has no CQI information available for a corresponding DL-<br>
channel situation. In this case, the Node-B transmits the<br>
CQI reporting request message to the UE via the DL traffic<br>
channel at step (D.<br>
Upon receiving the CQI reporting request message,<br>
the UE reports the CQI of a corresponding DL via the UL.<br>
In this case, the initial CQI information generated by the<br>
UE is typically generated on the basis of a common pilot<br>
signal simultaneously transmitted along with the CQI<br>
request message. However, it should be noted that the<br>
above-mentioned initial CQI information may be generated on<br>
the basis of a predetermined signal capable of indicating a<br>
DL-charmel situation. If the Node-B receives the CQI, it<br>
transmits DL data delayed for a predetermined time consumed<br>
for receiving the CQI reporting message. The delay degree<br>
of DL data may be indicated by a predetermined timeslot, a<br>
sub-frame, or an OFDM symbol according to the time consumed<br>
for receiving the initial CQI reporting message.<br>
As described above, the 3GPP LTE scheme requires the<br>
time of about 0.5ms to receive the initial CQI message.<br><br>
The time of about 0.5ms corresponds to the length of<br>
a sub-frame selected by most schemes. Therefore, as shown<br>
in FIG. 36, the embodiment of FIG. 36 considers the time<br>
consumed for receiving the initial CQI, and delays Tx data<br>
by a predetermined time corresponding to a single sub-frame,<br>
so that it transmits the delayed data.<br>
According to the above-mentioned delayed initial<br>
data transmission scheme, the CQI information transmitted<br>
from the UE may be configured in the form of a differential<br>
CQI value, so that it reduces the number of bits indicating<br>
corresponding information and effectively sues the UL<br>
resources.	In other words, the delayed initial data<br>
transmission scheme transmits only a difference between a<br>
previous CQI value and a current CQI value, so that it may<br>
transmit a small amount of information as compared to the<br>
scheme for transmitting all the CQI values.<br>
However, if the above-mentioned initial data<br>
transmission (e.g., if data is initially transmitted via a<br>
corresponding DL channel, or if data is transmitted after<br>
the lapse of a long idle time) is performed under the<br>
condition that there is no CQI information indicating the<br>
DL-channel situation, the CQI does not have previous CQI<br>
information at a sub-frame given behind the initial data<br>
transmission time, so that the delayed initial data<br>
transmission scheme cannot reduce the amount of<br>
corresponding information via the differential CQI.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a method for<br><br>
establishing	a	common default CQI at both the<br>
Node-B and the UE during the initial data transmission, and<br>
reporting/receiving only the differential CQI during the<br>
next CQI transmission/reception time.<br>
In more detail, as shown in FIG. 36, if the UE<br>
receives the CQI reporting request message from the Node-B<br>
at step (2), the UE replies to the CQI reporting request<br>
message and transmits a differential value between a stored<br>
default CQI value and the generated CQI value, instead of<br>
transmitting all the CQI values.<br>
The Node-B uses the same default CQI value as the<br>
UE's default CQI value, acquires all the CQI values (i.e.,<br>
an overall CQI value) on the basis of the received<br>
differential value, allocates downlink resources to the UE,<br>
and transmits data to the UE via the allocated DL resources.<br>
As a result, the above-mentioned scheme of FIG. 36 can more<br>
effectively use the UL traffic resources than the method<br>
for reporting the entire CQI value. The scheme of FIG. 36<br>
can be applied to all steps from the CQI reporting step<br>
replying to the CQI reporting request message for initial<br>
data transmission.<br>
Next, a method for allocating DL resources without<br>
intentionally delaying data transmission in the case of the<br>
initial data transmission will hereinafter be described in<br>
detail.<br>
FIG. 37 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
distributed resource allocation scheme and a localized<br><br>
resource allocation scheme according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The distributed resource allocation scheme shown in<br>
the left side of FIG. 37 distributes resources for data<br>
transmission to several frequency bands, instead of<br>
allocating the resources to only a specific frequency band,<br>
so that data is transmitted via the distributed resources.<br>
The localized resource allocation scheme shown in<br>
the right side of FIG. 37 allocates resources for data<br>
transmission to only a specific frequency band.<br>
Generally, provided that relatively correct<br>
information of individual frequency bands is recognized,<br>
the localized resource allocation scheme selects frequency<br>
band indicating good channel characteristics, and allocates<br>
resources to the selected frequency band, such that an<br>
overall throughput of the system can be increased. However,<br>
provided that information of individual frequency bands is<br>
insufficient and resources for data transmission are<br>
concentrated at a specific frequency band, the overall<br>
throughput of the system can be decreased. Therefore, the<br>
present invention provides a method for transmitting data<br>
according to the distributed resource allocation scheme<br>
shown in the left side of FIG. 37.<br>
FIG. 38 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for transmitting initial data according to the<br>
distributed resource allocation scheme according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 38, in the case of initial data<br>
transmission (e.g., if data is initially transmitted via<br>
the DL channel, or if data is transmitted after the lapse<br>
of a long idle time) under the condition that there is no<br>
available CQI information for the DL-channels status, the<br>
distributed resource, allocation scheme is designed to<br>
transmit data via the band composed of only a specific-area<br>
channel, so that an overall throughput of the system can be<br>
decreased. In order to solve this problem, the present<br>
invention provides a method for allocating/transmitting DL<br>
resources according to the distributed resource allocation<br>
scheme during the initial data transmission. As a result,<br>
although a channel situation of a specific band is poor,<br>
the present invention can reduce the number of data<br>
transmission errors because data is transmitted via the<br>
distributed channels.	As shown in FIG. 38, after the<br>
initial data transmission is completed, the DL resources<br>
can be allocated according to the distributed resource<br>
allocation scheme because CQI indicating each channel<br>
condition of a corresponding DL is pre-guaranteed, and the<br>
DL resources can be allocated according to the localized<br>
resource allocation scheme.<br>
After the initial data transmission is completed,<br>
CQI information transmitted from the UE may be configured<br>
in the form of a differential CQI value according to the<br>
above-mentioned delayed initial data transmission scheme.<br>
If the CQI value is an initially-reported CQI value, a<br><br>
predetermined reference for calculating the differential<br>
value is required. The default CQI value commonly used for<br>
the Node-B and the UE is established and used to calculate<br>
the differential value.<br>
Differently from either the method for transmitting<br>
initial data via the resources allocated by the distributed<br>
resource allocation scheme or the method for delaying the<br>
data transmission until receiving the CQI message for the<br>
initial data transmission, a method for performing the<br>
initial data transmission using the default CQI value will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 39 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for establishing a default CQI value during the<br>
transmission of initial data, and transmitting the<br>
established default CQI value according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 39, if data is firstly transmitted<br>
to a specific UE or there is no available CQI value for<br>
recognizing the DL-channel situation because a long period<br>
of time elapses from the final data transmission, the UE<br>
according to the delayed initial data transmission scheme<br>
may initially generate the CQI value using a common pilot<br>
signal received along with the CQI reporting request<br>
message. However, prior to receiving the CQI reporting<br>
request message, the UE may receive the common pilot<br>
channel via a cell searching process or a synchronization<br>
acquisition process between the UE and the Node-B, such<br><br>
that it may recognize the DL-channel situation via the<br>
received common pilot channel.<br>
In other words, prior to initiation of the initial<br>
data transmission, the UE may easily generate the CQI<br>
indicating the most recent DL-channel.situation as compared<br>
to the Node-B.	Therefore, the embodiment of FIG. 39<br>
transmits a previous CQI value contained in the UE as a<br>
default CQI value to the Node-B before starting the initial<br>
data transmission, and the Node-B allocates DL resources<br>
via the default CQI value, and transmits data via the<br>
allocated DL resources.<br>
As shown in FIG. 39, if data is firstly transmitted,<br>
or data is transmitted after the lapse of a long idle time,<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 39 transmits data using the default<br>
CQI value received from the UE, and may continuously use<br>
the default CQI value during the next data transmission.<br>
However, it is preferable that the embodiment of FIG. 39<br>
uses the new CQI value created by the common pilot signal<br>
transmitted along with the DL data. More preferably, if a<br>
differential CQI value is used as the CQI value, the UL<br>
resources can be more effectively used. As a result, the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 39 transmits data to the UE using<br>
resources allocated by the CQI value.<br>
FIG. 40 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for transmitting the CQI of each user using the<br>
default-CQI establishing method of FIG. 39 according to the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
If data is firstly transmitted to individual<br>
UEs (e.g., UE1 and UE2), or data is transmitted to the UEs<br>
after the lapse of a long idle time, the Node-B receives<br>
the default CQI value from the UEs. In this case, the<br>
default CQI value may be generated by a common pilot signal,<br>
which has been received during either the synchronization<br>
acquisition step or the cell searching step before the UE1<br>
and UE2 receive the initial data from the Node-B, so that<br>
the default CQI value indicates a predetermined-level DL<br>
channel situation. In this waym if the Node-B receives the<br>
default CQI value from each UE, it is preferable that the<br>
CQI value to be received from each UE at the next step is<br>
set to the differential CQI value. In this case, as shown<br>
in FIG. 40, if there are several UEs, each of which reports<br>
the CQI within a single sub-frame, the individual UEs can<br>
effectively report the CQI.<br>
Differently from the embodiment of FIG. 40, the<br>
present invention does not report the default CQI value<br>
generated by the UE to the Node-B, and allows the Node-B<br>
and the UE to have the common default CQI value, so that it<br>
may report the next CQI value on the basis of the<br>
differential CQI value. In this case, the default CQI<br>
value commonly used by the Node-B and the UE is used as a<br>
reference value for reporting the next differential CQI, so<br>
that the default CQI value may be pre-defined by a<br>
communication system or may be generated by the module for<br>
generating the same default CQI value contained in each of<br><br>
the Node-B and the UE. If the	initial	data<br>
transmission is performed using the predetermined default<br>
CQI value, it is preferable that data may be transmitted<br>
according to the delayed initial data transmission scheme<br>
or the distributed resource allocation scheme.<br>
Characteristics of the Node-B capable of<br>
implementing the initial data transmission method according<br>
to the present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
FIG. 41 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus<br>
for delaying data transmission until the CQI is received<br>
during the initial data transmission, and transmitting the<br>
delayed result, and the Node-B including the apparatus<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 41, the Node-B according to the<br>
present invention includes a buffer 1101, a controller 1102,<br>
and a transceiver 1103 used as a transmitter/receiver. If<br>
data (DL_DATAk) to be transmitted via the DL exists, this<br>
data (DL_DATAk) is applied to the buffer 1101. In this<br>
case, the controller 1102 determines whether the available<br>
CQI value is stored in the buffer 1101. In the case of<br>
the initial data transmission (e.g., if data is firstly<br>
transmitted to a specific UE, or if data is transmitted<br>
after the lapse of a long idle time), the controller 1102<br>
commands the transceiver 1103 to transmit the CQI reporting<br>
request message because there is no CQI value available for<br>
the buffer 1101.	If the Node-B receives the CQI value<br><br>
from a corresponding UE by replying	to	the	CQI<br>
reporting request message, the CQI value is transmitted to<br>
the buffer 1101 and the controller 1102 as shown in FIG. 11.<br>
Upon receiving the CQI value, the controller 1102 allocates<br>
the DL resources. In this way, after the CQI value is<br>
received in the controller 1102, the controller 1102<br>
transmits DL data (DL_DATAk+1) . Generally, Tx DL data is<br>
delayed by a predetermined time corresponding to the 1 sub-<br>
frame as compared to the initial DL data, so that the DL<br>
data can be stably transmitted.<br>
FIG. 42 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus<br>
for transmitting data according to the distributed resource<br>
allocation scheme, and the Node-B including the apparatus<br>
according to another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 42, the Node-B includes a buffer<br>
1201, a controller 1202, and a transceiver 1203. The Node-<br>
B of FIG. 42 determines whether the buffer 1201 includes<br>
available CQI values during the initial DL data. If there<br>
is no available CQI value, the controller 1201 generates a<br>
command for performing initial data transmission according<br>
to the distributed resource allocation scheme, so that DL<br>
data stored in the buffer 1201 is transmitted. In this<br>
case, it should be noted that the above-mentioned Tx DL<br>
data has no delay until the CQI is received from the UE,<br>
differently from the initial DL data transmitted from the<br>
Node-B of FIG. 41.<br><br>
If the initial DL data is transmitted from the<br>
transceiver 1203, the embodiment of FIG. 42 receives a CQI<br>
value corresponding to the initial DL data from the<br>
corresponding UE. In this case, it is preferable that the<br>
received CQI value may be a differential CQI value created<br>
on the basis of the default CQI value commonly contained in<br>
the Node-B and the UE, so that UL resources can be<br>
effectively used.<br>
FIG. 43 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus<br>
for transmitting data using the default-CQI value during<br>
the transmission of initial data, and the Node-B including<br>
the apparatus according to a still another preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 43 includes a buffer 1301, a<br>
controller 1302, and a transceiver 1303. In this case, if<br>
it is determined that the buffer 1301 has no CQI value<br>
available for the initial DL data transmission at steps CD<br>
and ©, the embodiment of FIG. 43 may generate a<br>
transmission command of the initial DL data on the basis of<br>
the default CQI value.<br>
In this case, the default CQI value may be a default<br>
CQI value commonly contained in the Node-B and the UE<br>
according to the communication standard prescribed for the<br>
communication system. Otherwise, the default CQI value may<br>
be a default CQI value reported to the Node-B. In this<br>
case, the default CQI value reported to the Node-B may be<br>
generated by signals, which are received in the<br><br>
synchronization	estimation step and the cell searching<br>
step before the corresponding UE receives the initial DL<br>
data. In this way, if the transceiver 1303 transmits the<br>
initial DL data using the default CQI value, it may receive<br>
the CQI value from a corresponding UE. In this case,<br>
provided that a differential value between the received CQI<br>
value and the ~ above-mentioned default CQI value is<br>
calculated and used, the UL resources can more effectively<br>
used.<br>
Althougn tne aoove-mentionea prererrea emooaxments<br>
have disclosed an exemplary case in which the reception end<br>
of data transmits the CQI value and the corresponding band<br>
position information to the transmission end, it should be<br>
noted that all kinds of predetermined feedback signals,<br>
each of which transmits both feedback information<br>
corresponding to the data reception and the position<br>
information of the data Rx band, may also be covered with<br>
the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
It should be noted that most terminology disclosed<br>
in the present invention is defined in consideration of<br>
functions of the present invention, and can be differently<br>
determined according to intention of those skilled in the<br>
art or usual practices. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the above-mentioned terminology be understood on the basis<br>
of all contents disclosed in the present invention.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in the<br><br>
present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention cover the modifications and variations of<br>
this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
[industrial Applicability]<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present<br>
invention transmits not only the CQI value but also the Rx<br>
band position information as feedback information, so that<br>
it can reduce the number of errors created when the Node-B<br>
tracks the CQI variation in the OFDM system capable of<br>
transmitting data via divided Tx bands. Therefore, the<br>
present invention can be effectively used for the cognitive<br>
radio communication system.<br>
The present invention allows the differential<br>
information to indicate the increment, decrement, and the<br>
same status between the current signal and the previous<br>
signal, so that it can more accurately track the CQI<br>
information. The present invention can easily change the<br>
range of a differential value according to the variation<br>
speed of the differential information, and the mobility is<br>
gradually emphasized. As a result, the present invention<br>
can be effectively applied to the rapidly-changing channel.<br>
If several UEs which desire to transmit feedback<br>
information at a specific timeslot, the Node-B decomposes<br>
the resources allocated for transmission of the feedback<br><br>
information according to priority	information	of<br>
individual UEs, so that the allocated resources can be<br>
effectively used. As a result, the present invention can<br>
be effectively applied to a communication system equipped<br>
with several UEs.<br>
The present invention provides a method for<br>
effectively transmitting data at the initial data<br>
transmission. If data is not transmitted to a destination<br>
during a long period of time, or if data is firstly<br>
transmitted to the destination, the present invention can<br>
be effectively used.<br>
