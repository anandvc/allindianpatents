				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a shed forming device for a weaving loom. It also relates to a weaving loom equipped with such a device.<br>
It is known to drive the heddle frames of a weaving loom by means of electric actuators, the connection between each frame and the actuator associated therewith being ensured by one or more connecting rods, on one or a plurality of rocking levers.<br>
In certain known devices, an eccentric is associated with at least one of the connecting rods, this making it possible to transform a movement of rotation of an electric motor into a rising and descending movement of a frame. In that case, an auxiliary clip may be provided on one of the connecting rods or one of the levers to allow a variation of the amplitude of the movement of a frame, i.e. the adjustment of the shed of the loom.<br>
In other known devices, the electric motor is animated by an oscillating rotating movement, this movement being transmitted to one of the connecting rods for controlling a heddle frame without using an eccentric. It is possible to vary the amplitude of the shed by playing on the amplitude of the oscillating movement of the motor.<br>
It is to this second type of device that the invention particularly relates. In this type of device, the known equipment is cumbersome and the assembly of a shed forming device is long and complex, particularly insofar as it requires the assembly of movement reducing members and of associated electric motors for transforming the movement of the rotor of each motor into a movement of which the speed and amplitude are compatible with the desired path for the heddle frames.<br>
In this spirit, the invention relates to a shed forming device for a weaving loom equipped with at least one heddle frame which is actuated by a drawing system incorporating, for the or each frame, at least one connecting rod for<br>
transmission of a drive movement generated by an electric actuator with oscillating rotating movement. This device is characterized in that the actuator comprises a self-contained assembly incorporating an electric motor and a reduction gear incorporating a hollow wheel, the output shaft of the motor being equipped with a pinion in mesh with an inner toothing of the hollow wheel, while this hollow wheel is adapted to drive in rotation, with a movement of oscillations, a shaft driving the afore-mentioned connecting rod.<br>
Thanks to the invention, the actuator associated with each heddle frame constitutes compact equipment that can be manipulated and installed in self-contained manner, this facilitating construction of a shed forming device and the operations of maintenance of a weaving loom equipped with such a device.<br>
According to advantageous aspects, such a device may incorporate one or more of the following characteristics taken in any technically admissible combination:<br>
-	The reduction gear is formed in a casing disposed at one end of the motor, this casing being closed and containing the pinion, the hollow wheel and a lubricant.<br>
-	The actuator may be equipped with a brake.<br>
-	The drive shaft may be connected to the connecting rod or rods by a crank pin fixed in rotation on this shaft.<br>
-	The actuator is equipped, on the same end face, with first means for connection of an electric power supply circuit and with second means for connection of an electric circuit for monitoring/controlling the actuator, these first and second connection means advantageously being separated from one another.<br>
-	The actuator is equipped, on the same end face, with means for connection to a circuit for circulation of a cooling fluid.<br>
-	The end face of the actuator on which the connection means, and possibly the cooling fluid circuit connection means are provided, is the one from which the drive shaft of the movement transmission rod projects.<br>
-	The actuator is adapted to be mounted on a support provided with means complementary of the connection means and possibly of the cooling fluid circuit connection means, the drive shaft being adapted to traverse this support when the actuator is mounted thereon. Means for fixing the actuator on the support may be provided.<br>
The invention also relates to a weaving loom equipped with a shed forming device as described hereinabove. Such a loom is more economical and easier to maintain than the known looms.<br>
The invention will be more readily understood and other advantages thereof will appear more clearly in the light of the following description of a form of embodiment of a shed forming device and of a weaving loom in accordance with its principle, given solely by way of example and made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a weaving loom according to the invention, in perspective.<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded view in perspective of a part of the loom of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is a section in plane P3 of Figure 2, and<br>
Figure 4 is a view in perspective by the inside of the output pinion of the electric motor and of the hollow wheel of the reduction gear of the actuator shown in Figures 1 to 3.<br>
The weaving loom M shown in Figure 1 comprises a plurality of heddle frames, of which only one has been shown in this Figure with reference C. This<br>
frame C is equipped with heddles 10 of which the respective eyes 11 are traversed by warp yams 12 moving in the direction of arrow Fi.<br>
The frame C is animated by a movement of vertical oscillations in the direction of double arrow F2. This movement is controlled by connecting rods of which only one is visible in Figure 1 with reference 20 which are coupled in the lower part of the frame C as well as on two rocking levers 22. These levers 22 are connected together by a connecting rod 24, while one of the levers 22 is connected by a connecting rod 26 to a crank pin 28 mounted on a drive shaft 30 constituting the output member of a rotating electric actuator 40.<br>
This actuator 40 is mounted on a support plate 80. In practice, and as shown in dashed and dotted lines in Figures 1 and 2, the plate is provided to be sufficiently wide to allow it to support one or more other actuators 40' of the type of actuator 40. The number of actuators 40 is adapted as a function of the number of frames C to be driven.<br>
The actuator 40 is provided with two orifices, of which only one is visible in Figure 2 with reference 41, which are aligned with orifices 81 provided on the plate 80, this allowing the passage of fixing screws of which only one is visible with reference 43, the second being indicated by its axial line X43. Nuts 43a are provided in order to immobilize the screws 43 and equivalent in the orifices 41 and 81.<br>
As is more particularly visible in Figures 2 to 4, the actuator 40 comprises a body 42 elongated in a direction A-A' corresponding to an axis of rotafion of a rotor 44 belonging to an electric motor 46. The rotor 44 forms the output shaft of the motor 46.<br>
48 denotes the stator of the motor 46, this stator being disposed radially about the principal part of the rotor 44. The rotor 44 is supported with respect to the body 42 thanks to bearings 44a and 44b.<br>
With respect to the median part of the rotor 44 located between the bearings, the rotor extends to the level of an electrically controlled brake system 50 known perse.<br>
44c denotes the end of the rotor 44 disposed at the level of the brake 50.<br>
At the level of its end 44d opposite the end 44c, the rotor 44 is in one piece with a pinion 52. In a variant, the pinion 52 may be added on the rotor 44. This pinion 52 is provided with an outer toothing 52a adapted to cooperate with an inner toothing 54a of a hollow wheel 54 which is in one piece with the drive shaft 30. The toothing 54a is made on the inner radial surface of a sector 54b fixed on the principal part 54c of the wheel 54 by means of screws, of which only one is visible in Figure 3 with reference 55.<br>
In a variant, the hollow wheel 54 might be added on the shaft 30 and assembled thereto by any appropriate means. According to another variant, the sector 54b might be in one piece with the principal part 54c.<br>
Bearings 30a and 30b support the shaft 30 and the hollow wheel 54 with respect to the rest of the actuator 40.<br>
Elements 52 and 54 are disposed inside a casing 46 closed by a cover 58, with the result that there is formed, between the bearing 44b and the cover 58, a closed volume V56 in which a lubricant such as oil is held captive and in which the elements 52 and 54 constitute a member 60 for reducing the oscillating rotating movement of the rotor 44, which makes it possible to control the oscillating rotating movement of the shaft 30 and consequently that of the rocking levers 22 and the oscillating movement of the frame C in the direction of double arrow F2.<br>
Thanks to the invention, the rotating oscillating movement F3 of the rotor 44 is transmitted, thanks to the members 52 and 54, to the shaft 30 which is thus animated by a movement of the same nature F4. This movement is transmitted<br>
by the crank pin 28 to the connecting rod 26 which has a movement F5 itself transmitted by the levers 22 and the connecting rods 20 and 26 to the frame C which has the movement F2.<br>
It should be noted that the amplitude and the speed of the movement F2, i.e. of the shed, are easily adjustable by playing on the amplitude and speed of the movement F3.<br>
40a denotes the end face of the actuator 40 from which the shaft 30 projects beyond the cover 58.<br>
The actuator 40 is provided, at the level of this face 40a, with a connector 72 intended to allow the connection of the actuator 40 on a connector 82 of corresponding shape borne by the plate 80 and connected to a line 82a for supplying electrical current to the actuator 40. The connector 82 is provided on the face 80a of the plate 80 against which the face 40a comes into abutment when the actuator is mounted on the plate.<br>
Similarly, the actuator 40 is equipped with a second connector 74 intended to be connected to a connector 84 of corresponding shape, likewise provided on the face 80a of the plate 80. The connector 84 is connected by a line 84a to means (not shown) for monitoring/controlling the actuator 40.<br>
The connectors 72 and 74 are sufficiently distant from each other to avoid any risks of disturbance. In a variant, the connectors 72 and 74 might be grouped in the form of a single connector, certain conductor wires in that case being sheathed in order to avoid disturbances.<br>
The plate 80 is provided with an orifice 85 for passage of the end of the shaft 30 on which the crank pin 28 is mounted.<br>
Two orifices 76 and 78 made on the face 40a are intended to cooperate with male connection members 86, 88 respectively, provided on the face 80a of the plate 80 in order to allow the circulation towards the interior of the body 42<br>
of a heat-exchanging fluid for cooling the motor 46. In effect, a circuit 46a for the circulation of heat-exchanging fluid is provided in the casing 42, in particular between the stator 48 and the body 42.<br>
In Figure 2, arrows F6 and F7 represent the direction of circulation of the heat exchanging fluid.<br>
In this way, by assembling the actuator 40 on the plate 80, the power supply of the motor 46, the electrical control of the actuator 40 and its connection to the cooling circuit, may be effected in one operation.<br>
In addition, the number of actuators may be easily and rapidly adapted to the number of frames to be driven. Similarly, the maintenance operations are facilitated, particularly the standard exchange of one or more actuators.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
