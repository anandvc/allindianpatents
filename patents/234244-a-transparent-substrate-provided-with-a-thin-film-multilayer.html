				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a transparent substrate provided<br>
with a thin-film multilayer comprising at least one functional metal layer,<br>
especially a silver-based layer, having reflection properties in the infrared<br>
and/or in the solar radiation range, at least one metal barrier layer in<br>
contact with the functional layer and at least one upper dielectric layer.<br>
Such substrates are already known in which the layers<br>
constituting the multilayer create an optical interference system that<br>
results in selective transmission of certain parts of the solar spectrum or<br>
infrared radiation.<br>
It is known that silver deposited as a functional layer on a<br>
substrate is relatively sensitive to chemical stresses, especially to attack<br>
by oxygen, and it is liable to be degraded during the subsequent<br>
deposition of another layer, especially when this is oxide-based. To protect<br>
the silver layers from being attacked by oxygen, they are therefore, as a<br>
general rule, protected by a thin metal layer applied on top of them, this<br>
layer being called a "barrier layer" that has a very high affinity for oxygen.<br>
Similarly, it may be opportune to have beneath the silver layer a<br>
metal barrier layer so as to protect the silver layer from an oxygen flux<br>
coming from the lower part of the multilayer.<br>
This type of multilayer is described for example in document<br>
FR-A-2 641 271, which relates to a substrate intended to be incorporated<br>
into a glazing unit, bearing a coating composed of a tin oxide, titanium<br>
oxide, aluminum oxide and/or bismuth oxide sublayer, then a zinc oxide<br>
layer with a thickness not greater than 15 nm, then a silver layer, a<br>
transparent covering layer comprising a layer of an oxide of a sacrificial<br>
metal, chosen from Ti, Al, stainless steel, Bi, Sn and mixtures thereof,<br>
and at least one other Sn, Ti, Al and/or Bi oxide layer, the oxide of<br>
sacrificial metal being formed by initial deposition of the sacrificial metal,<br>
with a thickness of 2 to 15 nm, followed by its conversion into an oxide so<br>
as to produce the barrier layer.<br>
This structure helps to improve the corrosion resistance of the<br>
silver layer, not only during manufacture of the coated substrate but also<br>
during the lifetime of the product.<br>
In practice, only titanium and stainless steel are given as<br>
illustrations of sacrificial metal, with a thickness of at least 3.5 nm.<br>
Nickel-chromium is also a metal quite often used to form a barrier<br>
layer in a silver-based multilayer. However, the optical performance of<br>
such multilayers is limited in terms of light transmission and their energy<br>
performance which could be further improved.<br>
In a multilayer known from document EP 104 870, which relates<br>
to the production of a low-emissivity coating by sputtering, one or more of<br>
an additional metal, other than silver, are sputtered onto a silver layer, in<br>
an amount equivalent to a layer from 0.5 to 10 nm in thickness, before<br>
carrying out reactive sputtering, in the presence of oxygen or of an<br>
oxidizing gas, onto the silver and the additional metal, of one or more<br>
antireflection metal oxide layers under conditions which, in the absence<br>
of the additional metal or metals, would lead to substantial reductions in<br>
the low-emissivity properties of the resulting product.<br>
Copper is presented as an advantageous additional metal because<br>
of its oxidation resistance and of its contribution to the low emissivity, but<br>
other metals are also envisioned that oxidize following the reactive<br>
sputtering process into a colorless oxide favorable to a high light<br>
transmission. Among such metals, aluminum, titanium and zirconium<br>
are mentioned. Other preferred metals are Bi, In, Pb, Mn, Fe, Cr, Ni, Co,<br>
Mo, W, Pt, Au, Vd, Ta and alloys such as stainless steel and brass.<br>
Various metal oxides are then combined to produce a superior<br>
antireflection coating.<br>
Example 19 reveals in particular the possibility of using zirconium<br>
as additional metal, with a thickness of 2.7 nm, on a 10 nm thick silver<br>
layer, in combination with two SnO2 oxide coatings with a thickness of 48<br>
nm underneath and 43 nm on top, respectively.<br>
Among the examples presented, this structure makes it possible to<br>
achieve an advantageous light transmission of 84 %.<br>
However, the Applicant has found that the mechanical integrity of<br>
such a multilayer is mediocre and that it does not sufficiently withstand<br>
the operations and handling that are needed for incorporating the<br>
substrate into a glazing unit, so that its properties, especially its<br>
emissivity and light transmission, are of course impaired thereby.<br>
The object of the invention is to propose a substrate provided with<br>
a thin-film multilayer of the aforementioned type that exhibits high<br>
performance in terms of light transmission, external reflection color and<br>
emissivity, while still exhibiting good mechanical resistance.<br>
The substrate according to the invention is provided with a thin-<br>
film multilayer comprising at least one functional layer, especially a silver-<br>
based layer, having reflection properties in the infrared and/or in the<br>
solar radiation range, at least one metal barrier layer in contact with the<br>
functional layer and at least one upper dielectric layer, and is<br>
characterized in that at least one barrier layer is based on Zr and in that<br>
the upper dielectric layer comprises at least one ZnO-based layer in<br>
contact with the functional layer or with the barrier layer.<br>
Within the meaning of the present application, the terms "lower"<br>
and "upper" define the relative position of a layer relative to the functional<br>
layer, without there necessarily being any contact between said layer and<br>
the functional layer.<br>
Also within the meaning of the present application, the term "metal<br>
barrier" is understood to mean a barrier that is deposited in metal form;<br>
however, it is obvious that this layer can undergo partial oxidation during<br>
deposition (during its own deposition, but above all during deposition of<br>
the next layer) or during a heat treatment.<br>
It has thus been demonstrated that zirconium metal exhibits a<br>
kind of incompatibility with most dielectrics commonly used to form<br>
multilayers that include functional metal layers. The nature of this<br>
incompatibility has not been clearly identified, and could prejudice<br>
interlaminar adhesion between the layers. The scratch resistance or<br>
abrasion resistance of a multilayer combining zirconium with zinc oxide is<br>
in fact satisfactory, whereas the other multilayers have unacceptable<br>
drawbacks.<br>
The invention applies to multilayers comprising at least one metal<br>
functional layer, especially based on silver, gold or copper, optionally<br>
doped with at least one additional metal, such as titanium or palladium<br>
in the case of silver.<br>
According to the invention, the zirconium-based barrier layer may<br>
be placed beneath and/or on top of the functional metal layer. The ZnO-<br>
based dielectric layer may be in direct contact with a Zr-based upper<br>
barrier, or in direct contact with the functional layer or with any upper<br>
barrier if a zirconium lower barrier layer is present.<br>
The structure according to the invention may thus be based on<br>
the sequence:<br>
functional metal layer/Zr/ZnO etc.<br>
where the ZnO layer is in direct contact with the zirconium.<br>
In this case, the high mechanical stability of the multilayer is<br>
attributed to the good adhesion of the zinc oxide deposited as a thin film<br>
on the zirconium layer, whereas the other known oxides adhere poorly to<br>
Zr, probably because of poor wetting of the oxide on the zirconium during<br>
deposition of the thin film.<br>
The multilayer may then comprise beneath the silver, a lower<br>
barrier layer based on a metal chosen from titanium, nickel-chromium,<br>
niobium, zirconium, etc.<br>
The structure according to the invention may also be based on the<br>
sequence:<br>
Zr/functional metal layer/ZnO etc.<br>
In this case, the high mechanical stability of the multilayer is due<br>
to the fact that, since zirconium is used as under-barrier, it is not<br>
exposed to an oxidizing plasma, since no oxide is deposited on top, and<br>
consequently it is very little oxidized by the layer deposited beforehand.<br>
An upper barrier may optionally be inserted between the<br>
functional metal layer and the zinc oxide, and this may be chosen from<br>
nickel-chromium, titanium, niobium and zirconium.<br>
A structure according to the invention may be followed by another<br>
structure according to the invention, this being identical or different in<br>
one and the same multilayer.<br>
Thanks to the structure according to the invention of the strictly<br>
lower and/or upper layers deposited on the functional layer, not only is<br>
a multilayer obtained that has very satisfactory light transmission,<br>
external reflection color and emissivity values, but also a multilayer<br>
exhibiting surprisingly good mechanical resistance and also, where<br>
appropriate, chemical resistance.<br>
The thickness of the barrier layer(s), especially that (those) based<br>
on Zr, is advantageously chosen to be of sufficient value for the layer to<br>
oxidize only partially or practically completely - without impairing the<br>
silver layer - during the subsequent deposition of oxide or during a heat<br>
treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as a toughening treatment.<br>
Preferably, this thickness is less than or equal to 6 nm, advantageously<br>
at least 0.2 nm, especially between 0.4 and 6 nm, and in particular 0.6<br>
to 2 nm.<br>
According to the invention, a Zr-based barrier layer is preferably<br>
deposited by magnetron sputtering using a zirconium metal target, which<br>
may optionally contain an additional element such as Ca, Y, or Hf, in a<br>
proportion of 1 to 10% by weight of the target.<br>
The or each functional metal layer is typically a silver layer, but<br>
the invention applies in the same way to other reflective metal layers,<br>
such as silver alloys, especially containing titanium or palladium, or<br>
layers based on gold or copper. The thickness of each functional layer is<br>
especially from 5 to 18 nm, preferably around 6 to 15 nm.<br>
The substrate according to the invention may comprise one or<br>
more functional metal layers, especially two or three, each with a<br>
thickness within the aforementioned ranges. At least one functional<br>
layer is associated with a zirconium-based barrier layer and preferably<br>
each functional metal layer is associated with a zirconium-based barrier<br>
layer. The position of the zirconium-based layer with respect to a<br>
functional metal layer is not necessarily the same as for the other<br>
functional metal layer or layers within a multilayer.<br>
The function of the zinc oxide upper dielectric layer is especially to<br>
protect the subjacent functional metal layer, while contributing to the<br>
optical properties of the substrate.<br>
This layer may in general be deposited with a thickness of at least<br>
5 nm, especially around 5 to 25 nm, and more particularly 5 to 10 nm.<br>
The multilayer may also include a lower dielectric layer based on<br>
an oxide or nitride, especially comprising the sequence SnO2/TiO2/ZnO<br>
or the sequence Si3N4/ZnO.<br>
The multilayer may also include an upper mechanical protection<br>
layer whose function is to improve the mechanical resistance of the<br>
multilayer, especially its resistance to scratching or abrasion.<br>
This may be an optionally doped layer based on an oxide, nitride<br>
and/or oxynitride, especially based on at least one oxide of titanium, zinc,<br>
tin, antimony, silicon or mixtures thereof, optionally nitrided, or based on<br>
a nitride, especially based on silicon nitride or aluminum nitride. Mention<br>
may more particularly be made of TiO2, SnO2, and Si3N4, or mixed oxides<br>
based on zinc and tin (ZnSnOx), optionally doped with another element<br>
such as Sb, or based on zinc and titanium (ZnTiOx) or else based on zinc<br>
and zirconium (ZnZrOx).<br>
It may also be a combination of layers based on the<br>
abovementioned materials, especially Si3N4 /SnZnOx or Si3N4 /TiO2 .<br>
Among these compounds, silicon nitride has an additional<br>
advantage when the substrate is intended to undergo an oxidizing heat<br>
treatment. This is because it blocks the diffusion of oxygen into the<br>
interior of the multilayer, including at high temperature. Since the nitride<br>
is largely inert with respect to an oxidizing attack, it undergoes no<br>
appreciable chemical (oxidative) or structural modification during a heat<br>
treatment of the toughening type. It therefore causes practically no optical<br>
modification of the multilayer in the case of heat treatment, especially in<br>
terms of light transmission level. This layer may also act as barrier to the<br>
diffusion of species migrating from the glass, especially alkaline metals.<br>
Furthermore, thanks to its refractive index close to 2, it is readily received<br>
in a multilayer of the low-emissivity type from the standpoint of adjusting<br>
the optical properties.<br>
This protection layer may generally be deposited with a thickness<br>
of at least 10 nm, for example between 15 and 50 nm, especially around<br>
25 to 45 nm.<br>
Preferably, the multilayer according to the invention<br>
substantially preserves its properties, especially optical properties, after<br>
a heat treatment at a temperature of at least 500°C, whether this be for<br>
example a toughening operation, annealing operating or bending<br>
operation.<br>
The present invention also relates to low-emissivity or solar-<br>
protection glazing that incorporates at least one substrate as described<br>
above and especially laminated glazing or double glazing.<br>
This is because the coated substrate may be used as double<br>
glazing, the multilayer being able to be affixed to the insert film within the<br>
laminated assembly facing the outside (face 2) or facing the inside (face 3).<br>
In such glazing, at least one substrate may be toughened or hardened,<br>
especially that bearing the multilayer. The coated substrate may also be<br>
joined to another glass, at least via a gas-filled cavity in order to form an<br>
insulating multiple glazing unit (double glazing). In this case, the<br>
multilayer preferably faces the intermediate gas-filled cavity (face 2<br>
and/or face 3). A double glazing unit according to the invention may<br>
incorporate at least one laminated glass.<br>
When the glazing according to the invention is mounted as double<br>
glazing with another substrate, the assembly advantageously has a light<br>
transmission of between 40 and 90%.<br>
Furthermore, the glazing according to the invention<br>
advantageously has a selectivity defined by the ratio of the light<br>
transmission to the solar factor, Tl/SF of between 1.1 and 2.1.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of improving the<br>
mechanical strength of a transparent substrate, especially glass, provided<br>
with a thin-film multilayer comprising at least one functional metal layer,<br>
especially a silver-based layer, having reflection properties in the infrared<br>
and/or in the solar radiation range, at least one metal barrier layer in<br>
contact with the functional layer and at least one upper dielectric layer,<br>
characterized in that at least one functional metal layer, a Zr-based lower<br>
and/or upper barrier layer, respectively on and/or under said functional<br>
metal layer, and a ZnO-based upper dielectric layer are deposited on the<br>
substrate by sputtering.<br>
The invention is illustrated hereinafter by comparative examples<br>
and examples according to the invention, in which various barriers and<br>
dielectric layers will be examined.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the thicknesses of the substrates and<br>
of the glazing of the comparative examples are identical to the thicknesses<br>
of the substrates and of the glazing of the examples according to the<br>
invention with which they are compared.<br>
The following optical properties are evaluated: light transmission,<br>
light reflection on the multilayer side and color in reflection in the L*a*b*<br>
system.<br>
The light transmission and light reflection were measured with<br>
an integrating-sphere measurement apparatus that measured the light<br>
flux in all directions on one side of the substrate or on the other.<br>
The thermal properties were measured by means of the electrical<br>
surface resistance and the emissivity.<br>
The mechanical resistance properties were also evaluated:<br>
- shear abrasion resistance of the multilayer, obtained in the<br>
Erichsen scrubbing brush test. It will be recalled that in this test the<br>
multilayer is scrubbed by a brush with bristles made of polymeric<br>
material, the multilayer being covered with water;<br>
- scratch resistance in the Erichsen stylus test. It will be recalled<br>
that in the test a stylus loaded with a weight is moved over the substrate<br>
at a given speed. The load (in newtons) needed to make the stylus visibly<br>
scratch the multilayer is noted; and<br>
- indentation resistance in the Taber test. It will be recalled in the<br>
Taber test that the specimen is subjected to abrasive rollers for a given<br>
time and the proportion (in %) of the surface of the multilayer system that<br>
is not torn after 20 revolutions under a load of 250 g is measured.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
In this comparative example, a silver-based multilayer according<br>
to the prior art, with a nickel-chromium barrier and a tin oxide upper<br>
dielectric layer, was deposited on a glass substrate 4 mm in thickness.<br>
A multilayer of the following type was obtained:<br>
substrate /SnO2 /TiO2 /ZnO/Ag/NiCr/SnO2.<br>
This substrate was produced by sputtering, by making the<br>
substrate run through a chamber past metal targets in an argon<br>
atmosphere, in order to deposit a metal layer, and in an argon/oxygen<br>
atmosphere in order to deposit an oxide.<br>
The results of the optical and energy measurements are given in<br>
Table 1 below.<br>
The substrate was mounted in a double glazing arrangement<br>
having an intermediate cavity 15 mm in thickness filled with 90° argon,<br>
with a second glazed element 4 mm in thickness, and the transmission,<br>
the light reflection, the color in reflection, the solar factor and the<br>
coefficient U were again measured.<br>
The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
The results of the mechanical measurements are given in Table 3<br>
below.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
In this comparative example, a multilayer substantially identical<br>
to that of Comparative Example 1 was used. Comparative Example 2<br>
differs solely by the fact that the nickel-chromium barrier is replaced<br>
with zirconium. A stack of the following type was obtained:<br>
substrate / SnO2 /TiO2 /ZnO/Ag/Zr/SnO2.<br>
The results of the optical measurements are given in Table 1 in<br>
monolithic format, in Table 2 in double glazing format, and results of the<br>
mechanical measurements are given in Table 3 below.<br><br>
This shows that replacing the NiCr barrier with a Zr barrier<br>
improves the color in reflection on the multilayer side (more neutral<br>
color), increases the transmission and reduces the resistance per<br>
square in monolithic format.<br>
This results in double glazing that is also slightly more neutral in<br>
external reflection, with a higher transmission and with better thermal<br>
insulation characteristics in double glazing format (U = 1.19 W.m2.K1 in<br>
the case of the NiCr barrier, compared with U = 1.15 W.m-2.K-1 in the case<br>
of the Zr barrier).<br>
By replacing the NiCr barrier with Zr in the multilayer, the<br>
mechanical integrity of the multilayers in the Erichsen scrubbing brush<br>
test with a Zr barrier was catastrophic - after the test severe delamination<br>
of the multilayer was observed.<br>
The scratch resistance was also reduced.<br>
Only the resistance to the Taber test was improved, indicating<br>
special behavior as regards indentation compared with abrasion.<br>
Example 1<br>
In this example, on a glass substrate of the same type as for<br>
Comparative Example 1, a multilayer of the following type was<br>
deposited:<br>
substrate /SnO2 / TiO2 / ZnO / Ag / Zr / ZnO / SnO2<br>
22 nm / 8 nm / 8 nm / 10 nm / 0.6 nm/ 21 nm / 22 nm<br>
The results of the optical measurements are given in Table 4 in<br>
monolithic format, in Table 5 in double glazing format, and the results of<br>
the mechanical measurements are given in Table 6 below.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example differs from Example 1 only by the fact that the the<br>
final layer of SnO2 is replaced with Si3N4. A stack of the following type<br>
was obtained:<br>
substrate / SnO2 / TiO2 / ZnO / Ag / Zr / ZnO / Si3N1<br>
22 nm / 8 nm / 8 nm / 10 nm / 0.6 nm/ 21 nm / 22 nm<br>
Comparative Examples la and 2a<br>
These comparative examples are similar to Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 2 in which the thickness of the multilayers was<br>
adapted so as to be identical to the thicknesses of the homologous<br>
multilayers of Example 1.<br>
In practice, the thicknesses were as follows:<br>
Comp. Ex. la<br>
substrate / SnO2 / TiO2 / ZnO / Ag / NiCr / SnO2<br>
22 nm / 8 nm / 8 nm/ 10 nm/ 0.6 nm/ 43 nm.<br>
Comp. Ex. 2a<br>
substrate / SnO2 / TiO2 / ZnO / Ag / Zr / SnO2<br>
22 nm / 8 nm / 8 nm / 10 nm / 0.6 nm/ 43 nm.<br>
The results of the optical measurements are given in Table 4 in<br>
monolithic format and in Table 5 in double glazing format, and the results<br>
of the mechanical measurements are given in Table 6 below.<br>
Comparative Examples la and 2a also show that replacing the<br>
NiCr barrier with a Zr barrier results in an increase in the light<br>
transmission and a reduction in the emissivity in monolithic format. In<br>
double glazing format, the light transmission also increases and the<br>
factor U is lower for the same silver thickness when the barrier is of<br>
zirconium in preference to NiCr.<br>
The levels achieved by Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate a better<br>
light transmission than with an NiCr barrier and a more neutral color in<br>
reflection.<br>
Table 6<br>
Example 1 shows that the insertion of a ZnO layer between the<br>
Zr layer and the Sn02 layer very slightly improves the behavior in the<br>
Taber test, but most particularly it makes the behavior in the Erichsen<br>
test similar to that of a multilayer with an NiCr barrier.<br>
This result is surprising since in the Erichsen brush test the<br>
multilayer of Comparative Example 2 with a Zr/SnO2 sequence<br>
exhibited very poor adhesion.<br>
From Example 2, it should be noted that the behavior of the<br>
multilayers with a final Si3N4 layer is even better than that of<br>
multilayers with an SnO2 final layer, with a better resistance to the<br>
Erichsen stylus test and to the Taber test.<br>
The behavior of the multilayers according to the invention in the<br>
HC1 and HH tests at high humidity (40°C, 90% humidity, for 5 days)<br>
was quite similar, or even slightly better, than that already obtained<br>
with the multilayers having an NiCr-based barrier.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example has a multilayer comprising two silver layers with<br>
zirconium lower barrier layers, of the type:<br>
Si3N4 / ZnO/ Zr / Ag/ ZnO/ Si3N4 / ZnO / Zr / Ag / ZnO / Si3N4<br>
22 / 10 / 0.5/8.2/ 10 / 69 / 10 / 0.5 / 10/ 10 / 28 nm.<br>
The multilayer was deposited on a substrate consisting of a glass<br>
sheet 1.6 mm in thickness.<br>
The mechanical properties of the multilayer were measured by<br>
means of a Taber test and by a peel test in which an adhesive tape was<br>
applied to the multilayer, the tape was pulled off and the integrity of the<br>
multilayer was assessed. The results of the mechanical measurements<br>
are given in Table 7 below.<br>
This substrate was subjected to a heat treatment of the bending<br>
type, at above 640°C for 6 minutes, followed by air cooling, and the<br>
optical changes after the heat treatment were determined. The substrate<br>
had the same optical quality after the heat treatment.<br>
This substrate was joined to a glass sheet 2.1 mm in thickness in<br>
a laminated glazing unit using a PVB insert film 0.76 mm in thickness,<br>
the multilayer facing toward the inside of the laminate.<br>
The optical properties of the multilayer were measured as<br>
previously, and the results of the optical measurements are given in<br>
Table 8 below.<br>
Comparative Example 3a<br>
This comparative example is similar to Example 3 in which the<br>
zirconium barrier layers were replaced with nickel-chromium layers. A<br>
multilayer of the following type was obtained:<br>
Si3N4 / ZnO/ NiCr / Ag/ ZnO/ Si3N4/ ZnO / Zr / Ag / ZnO / Si3N4<br>
22 / 10 / 0,7 / 8,2/ 10/69 / 10 / 0,7 / 10 / 10 / 28 nm.<br>
This substrate was subjected to the same heat treatment as in<br>
Example 3: after the heat treatment, the substrate became hazy and<br>
pitting was observed.<br>
The results of the optical and mechanical measurements are given<br>
in Tables 7 and 8.<br><br>
