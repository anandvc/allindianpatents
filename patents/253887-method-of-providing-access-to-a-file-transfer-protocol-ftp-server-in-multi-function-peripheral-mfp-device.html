				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of Multi-function Peripherals (MFPs), specifically to the field of computer based user interfaces for MFPs. More particularly the invention relates to a method of accessing the embedded FTP server in a MFP through the embedded HTTP server (EWS).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Multifunction peripherals (MFP) are becoming increasingly popular, because they provide a number of different functions such as scanning, printing, copying, and sending and receiving faxes, for example, in a single device. The presently available MFPs provide two separate HTML based and FTP based interface for users to interact with the MFP and access the various features offered by the MFPs. The HTML based interface is also called an Embedded Web Server (EWS) that enables the features of the MFPs to be accessed through host systems or computers through a network.<br>
The present MFPs contain an embedded HTTP server (EWS) and an embedded FTP server. Both these servers enable users to access different services offered by an MFP through the network. The users utilize a HTTP client such as Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Mozilla Firefox to access, through the network, the HTTP server embedded in the MFP. The users are able to view through the HTTP a 'web page' that enables the various services offered by the MFP. However, the users also require an FTP client so as to access the separate FTP server embedded in the MFP. Usually, such FTP clients are available in existing HTTP clients such as those listed above. However, such clients provide limited functionality and do not enable the users to access all the services offered by the embedded FTP server. Further, such clients usually do not provide an aesthetic user interface for the users. Additionally, FTP clients are not easy to use and may require the users to learn separate FTP commands so as to access all the services provided by the FTP server.<br><br>
Researches are going on to make the system more user convenient. One of the patent publications describes a system and method for enabling communication between two network devices. The network devices communicate through standard network protocols, such as TCP/IP, NFS, FTP and HTTP. A web server protocol HTTP is used to provide a user interface to the user for remote monitoring and remote control using a standard web browser application. The patent publication discloses the concept of communication through file transfer protocol between two network devices, using an embedded web server. However, the patent publication does not seem to disclose the concept of interaction between a FTP server and an HTTP server for providing access to the FTP services.<br>
Another patent publication discloses a system and method for configuring a graphical user interface (GUI). A user requests for data from a data source with the help of the GUI. The data source can be an FTP server. The GUI is automatically configured to receive and display data from the data source. The patent publication does not disclose the concept of accessing FTP server using a web server embedded in a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP). The patent publication discloses system and method for configuring a graphical user interface (GUI) to access FTP services. However, the patent publication does not disclose the concept of accessing FTP server using web server embedded in a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP).<br>
The patent publication describes a method and system for managing a program application. A hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) server is embedded in the program application. The HTTP server processes requests of HTTP clients and provides information based on the requests to a script engine. The script engine formats the resulting information and provides the formatted information to the user interface. The patent publication does not disclose the concept of accessing FTP server using a web server embedded in a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP).<br>
In the state of art system as shown in the figure 1, separate clients are required to access the HTTP server and the FTP server separately on the MFP for performing their required operations. From the figure it can be seen that the various<br><br>
functionality modules like the printer module scanner module, fax module etc. are accessed through the FTP server and the HTTP server separately. Again the FTP server is accessed separately through the FTP Client and the same with the HTTP server where it is accessed through a separate HTTP client.<br>
Due to this system a FTP client is required on the computer or host system to access the FTP server in the MFP. Different FTP clients in different host system may behave differently from each other and provide different user interfaces. Most of the available FTP clients do not have an aesthetic look and feel for the user and the user needs to know some basic FTP commands to use the FTP client and access the FTP server on the MFP.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of accessing the embedded FTP server in a MFP through the embedded HTTP server (EWS). The invention enables users to access the embedded FTP server in an MFP through the embedded HTTP server (EWS). The EWS in the MFP interacts with the FTP server so as to enable the users to access all the services offered by the FTP Server in MFP through an HTTP client.<br>
The invention provides the user to avoid separate FTP client to access the FTP server in the MFP. EWS will have option to access FTP server and do the FTP operations. If a change in the functionality of the FTP server is considered by the company, then there is no need to test its compatibility with various available FTP clients.<br>
As a result the MFP will be compatible with various existing and new host systems that do not have FTP clients. The EWS serves as a single-entry point to access the various features of the printer and there is no need of separate configuration of the FTP server of the MFP. Also the need to provide a separate FTP server port number during login into the FTP server through the host system is eliminated. The EWS provides good error handling mechanisms that can display appropriate<br><br>
help to the users. The user does not need to configure any FTP clients or learn any special FTP commands. The EWS and an HTTP client can provide a more aesthetic view for the users than an FTP client. There is a greater ease of use of the FTP features of the MFP by the users.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method to access FTP server using embedded web server in MFP comprising the steps of;<br>
(a)	accessing the 'home page' of the Embedded Web Server through an HTTP client;<br>
(b)	accessing the features of the FTP server by accessing a 'FTP page' on the EWS;<br>
(c)	selecting the required FTP service by clicking an appropriate link on the 'FTP page'; and<br>
(d)	\interacting with the FTP server embedded in the MFP by the EWS to provide the user with the required FTP service.<br>
The 'home page' is the main or first page offered by the EWS, and enables access to all the features offered by the EWS. The MFP has various modules for performing the various input/output operations . The modules are accessed through the FTP and HTTP servers and the servers in turn are accessible by each other. The method enables the HTTP client to access the various features of the FTP server through the HTTP server, without providing a separate access to the FTP server in the MFP.<br>
An option can be given to change the way user accesses FTP Server either through HTTP client or FTP client. Based on the selection user can access FTP server using HTTP client or using FTP client. At any point of time he can access FTP server from only one client.<br>
The invention proposes a method which enables the HTTP server (EWS) equiped in the MFP to interact with the embedded FTP server. This enables HTTP client to<br><br>
access the various features of the FTP server through the HTTP server, without providing a separate access to the FTP server in the MFP. The users can view the various features of the FTP server on the 'home web page' offered by the EWS. Further, the HTTP interface is easier to use with a 'point and click' functionality, which does not require the user to learn any special FTP commands. Thus the user can navigate easily through the web page according to his/her requirements. The 'home page' is the main or first page offered by the EWS. The user accesses an 'FTP page' on the EWS that offers access to the features of the FTP server and can select the required FTP service by clicking an appropriate link on the 'FTP page'. As a result EWS interacts with the FTP server embedded in the MFP so as to provide the user with the required FTP service.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Drawing 1 illustrates an MFP with an embedded HTTP and FTP server as available in the prior art.<br>
Drawing 2 illustrates an MFP with an embedded FTP server interacting through a HTTP server according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The object of the invention is to enable users to access the FTP server embedded in an MFP using an HTTP client. The invention obviates the requirement of a separate FTP client for the users to access the FTP server as shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
The MFP is having various modules for performing the various input/output operations of printing, scanning, faxing etc. The modules can be accessed through the FTP and HTTP servers and the servers are in turn can be accessed by each other. The system enables the HTTP client to access the various features of the FTP server through the HTTP server, without providing a separate access to the FTP server in the MFP.<br>
The invention enables the HTTP server (EWS) embedded in the MFP to interact with the embedded FTP server. This enables users to access the various features of the FTP server through the HTTP server. The users can view the various features of the FTP server on the 'web page' offered by the EWS. This enables an aesthetic look and feel to be designed for the user. Further, the HTTP interface is easier to use with a 'point and click' functionality, which does not require the user to learn any special FTP commands. Additionally, any changes made in the functionality of the FTP server do not need to be tested for compatibility with the existing FTP clients. This is because the FTP server is being accessed through the HTTP server and only the compatibility of the FTP server with the HTTP server needs to be verified.<br>
The following is a procedure that can be followed by a user to access the features offered by an embedded FTP server through a EWS in an MFP:<br>
1.	The user accesses the 'home page' of the EWS through an HTTP client. This 'home page' is the main or first page offered by the EWS, and enables access to all the features offered by the EWS.<br>
2.	The user accesses an 'FTP page' on the EWS that offers access to the features of the FTP server. This 'FTP page', for example, can be accessed through a link on the 'home page'.<br>
3.	The user selects the FTP service that is required by clicking an appropriate link on the 'FTP page'.<br>
4.	The EWS interacts with the FTP server embedded in the MFP so as to provide the user with the required FTP service.<br>
The invention can also be implemented in devices other than MFPs that offer the<br><br>
services of embedded FTP servers. Such services offered by the device can be implemented by providing an HTTP server that interacts with the FTP server. The HTTP server can provide an external HTTP interface for other devices to access the services offered by the FTP server.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
