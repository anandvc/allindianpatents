				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.        Field of the Inveiitjon<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an improved safety valve of pressure cookers wherein the novel inventions included in safety valve are body cover covering the stop pin which is encircled by the spring, body cover at one end attached to the safety body with holes which is in turn attached to hex nut and rubber washer and at the other end body cover is fitted with brass nut.<br>
2.  Description of the Related Art<br>
Normally the conventional safety valve comprises of a hex nut with rubber washer. And the safety valve works only when the whistle is not working.<br>
Technically there is a defect in the conventional safety valve:<br>
a)	When the whistle is not working the pressure is released through the safety valve due to the defect, it bursts out completely damaging the rubber washer.<br>
b)	The cooking food is also spoiled.<br>
c)	A new safety valve should be replaced by a mechanic only.<br>
d)	Therefore, there is unnecessary wastage of time and money.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above-described problems, it is an objective of the present invention to make the present invention more advantageous and technically sound than the conventional safely valve and the defect has been removed:<br>
a)	When the whistle is not working the accumulated pressure produced in the cooker exerts a force on the stop pin and the stop pin is pushed upwards and the extra pressure is released through holes present on the safety body, when the pressure is released the stop pin comes back to the normal position due to the action of the spring.<br>
b)	Thus no damage is caused to the safety valve i.e. hex nut and rubber washer.<br>
c)	Cooking food is not spoiled.<br>
d)	Saves the time and money.<br>
The principal of the present invention is to release the extra pressure produced in the cooker when the whistle is not working safely without damaging the safety valve.<br>
An improved safety valve of pressure cookers characterized in that the safety valve comprises of a body cover covering the stop pin which is encircled by the spring, body cover at one end attached to the safety body with holes which is in turn attached to hex nut and rubber washer and at the other end body cover is fitted with brass nut; wherein the safety valve is used to release the extra pressure produced in the cooker when the whistle is not working.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above objective and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which reference numerals indicate corresponding parts in the figure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now, a device for improvement in safety valve for pressure cookers according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and according to the method will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
As shown in the drawings the present invention consists of a body cover, safety body, stop pin, brass unit, spring as shown in figs 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 respectively.<br>
Fig 1. shows the assembled safety valve with body cover 2, safety body 3, brass nut 5, hex nut 7 and rubber washer 9.<br>
The external body cover 2, is a hollow aluminum cover, coated with black powder with threads 10 at the inner wall, a space at apex 8 for brass nut 3, and space at the inner side 7, for the stop pin 14, the inner wall 6, fits on the safety body 2.<br>
As shown in fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings the safety body 3, has four holes 12 spaced equally, and is joined to the hex nut 7 and stop pin 4 is inserted in to the safety body 3 through threads 13.<br>
According to fig 4, the stop pin is cylindrical, tapering at one end, which fits into the mouth of the hex nut 7 passing through safety body and at other end with threads 14 to fit into the brass nut 5. The stop pin is made up of brass and is nickel plated.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the brass nut 3 with a hollow center with threads 15 to fit into the stop pin 4 with compact dome shaped at apex 16.<br>
Fig 6 shows the spring 6, which covers the stop pin 4.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the hex nut 7 with thread 16 and is attached to rubber washer 9 and safety body 3.<br>
Fig. 8 shows top view of stop pin washer.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the rubber washer 9 with inner ring 17 that encircles safety body 3.<br>
The mechanism involved in the working of the safety valve is designed in such a way that the pressure is released safely without any damage to safety valve. The pressure is released at a minimum of 1-kg cm2 to 1.5- kg cm2 from the whistle. When the whistle is not working the pressure goes on accumulating in the cooker. So when 2.0-kg cm2 pressure is produced it exerts a force on the safety valve due to the pressure force the stop pin is pushed upwards and held in that position by the action of spring and the pressure is released through the holes from the safety body. After the release of the pressure the stop pin comes back to the normal position by the action of spring and closes the hex nut. A maximum of 3.0-kg cm2 is released from the safety valve.<br>
The assembling of the safety valve is done by placing the spring on the stop pin and the stop pin is pushed inside the body cover and the body cover is threaded on to the safety body, so that the tapering end of the stop pin closes the mouth of hex nut through the safety body and the other end of the stop pin is fitted with the brass net.<br>
While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An improved safety valve of pressure cookers characterized in that the safety valve comprises of a body cover covering the stop pin which is encircled by the spring, body cover at one end attached to the safety body with holes which is in turn attached to hex nut and rubber washer and at the other end body cover is fitted with brass nut; wherein the safety valve is used to release the extra pressure produced in the cooker when the whistle is not working.<br>
2.	An improved safety valve of pressure cookers as claimed in claim 1 wherein the improved safety yalve comprises of a stop pin with spring with tapering apex which fits in the hex nut and with threads at the other end for fitting in to the brass nut.<br>
3.	An improved safety valve of pressure cookers as claimed in claim 2 wherein the stop pin is made up of brass and is nickel plated with one of its end in triangular shape which fixes in the mouth of the hex nut and the other end has threads which fits in to the brass nut.<br>
