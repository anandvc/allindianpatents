The synthesis of polymers with various specific properties such as high glass transition temperature, improved Drocessabi1ity, and long term thermal stability is still major driving force for development o f new monomers. B i s(nap h t h a1i m ido) based polymers will have high chemical and thermal stability, and h i g h s o 1 u b i 1 i t y as camp a r e d t o t h o a e p r e p a r e d w i t; h b i s (p h t h a 1 i m i d o ) polymer s . T hi e p o 1 y m e r s s y n t h e s i s e d u s i n g the compounds prepared by the process of this invention would be obtained by nuc1eophi1ic halo displacement polymerisation reaction. One example would be polythioarylene copolymers,<br>

In the conventional synthetic: route to the synthesis of poiythioarylenes, the polymer precipitates out of the system as soon as a critical molecular weight is achieved leading to a restriction in the molecular weight. If the compounds prepared by the process of the present invention are used as monomers, since<br>
the polymer is soluble, precipitation during the course of the polymerization does not occur and high molecular weight polymers can be obtained.<br>
Another advantage is the presence of imide ring which would help in easy displacement of halo group so as to result in high molecular weight polythioarylene copolymer. The methylene spacer will help in enhanced solubility, while rigid naphthalene ring would lead to polymers with good thermal and mechanical stability.<br>
i<br>
The known method of preparation of bis(halonaphthalimido) compounds namely bis(4-halo-l,8-naphthalimido)alkylene  reported hitherto in the literature involves :<br>
(i) the use of dioxan giving yields in the range of 58 % as described in a report U S. patent 5554622 by BAYER AG, Germany in 1994. The reaction scheme involved the use of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride with N.N'-bis(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane in dioxan with the primary objective of the use of this material for anti-tumor activity.<br>
(ii) Yamada et.al., reported in Japanese patent 900328 (1991) reaction of 4-chloro naphthalic anhydride and hexamethylene diamine in N-methyl pyrrolidone and the use of tolune at temperature of 160°C .<br>
However it has been reported by Danuta Sek et. al. [J.Poly.Sc., Part A, Poly. Chem. Ed., 33, 547, (1995)] that the use of N-methyl pyrrolidone could lead to the formation<br><br>
of isoimide which is an undesired product. Isoimide has less thermal stability compared with imides. Also amine reacts with halogens, instead of anhydride in N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
The present process offers quantitative selective synthesis of imides only (without the formation of isoimides, protecting the halogen).<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of bis (halo-naphthalimido) alkylenes which are suitable forth synthesis of soluble high performance polymer by nucleophilic halo displacement polymerization reaction offering advantages of ease of operation and leading to improved yields as well. Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of bis(halo-naphthalimido) alkylene of formula 1 wherein R = (CH2)n -n = 2 to 12 and X is halogen of the drawing accompanying the specification which comprises, reacting in an inert atmosphere 4-halo-1, 8-naphthalic anhydride and an aliphatic diamine such as herein described in a ratio of 1.5:1 to 5:1 (w/w) in a polar aprotic solvent such as herein described and in the presence of a catalyst such as herein described at a temperatures in the range of 110 to 250°C for a period ranging from 6 to 15 hours, cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, pouring the reaction mixture into an alkanol, as herein described, separating the product by conventional methods, washing with alkanol as defined above to remove the unreacted material and the by products formed during reaction followed by drying to get the final product, Bis (halo-naphthalimido) alkylene.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the inert gas used may be such as nitrogen, argon.<br><br>
