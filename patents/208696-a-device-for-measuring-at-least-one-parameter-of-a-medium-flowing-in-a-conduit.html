Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for measuring at least one parameter of a medium flowing in a conduit.<br>
Prior Art<br>
A device is already known (DE 197 35 664 Al), in which the measuring element is arranged within a tubular body through which the medium flows, the upstream end of the tubular body extending into the filter chamber and having inlet orifices there on the outer surface, in order to reduce the degree to which the measuring element is subjected to dirt particles or water droplets. Particularly in the case of heavily contaminated air and a high proportion of water in the intake area of the internal combustion engine, there is the risk that the air filter will be saturated with water which then passes through the filter mat and at the same time takes dirt particles with it. On the downstream side of the air filter, the actual clean side, therefis then the risk that the intake air will again entrain from the filter surface dirt particles and water droplets which are then precipitated on the measuring element in an undesirable way and lead to faulty measurements or a failure of the measuring element. By the inlet orifices being arranged on the outer surface, the tubular body according to the prior art reduces the risk of deposits on the measuring element, but this design brings about an undesirable pressure drop which leads to a reduction in measuring sensitivity.<br>
DE 44 07 209 C2 discloses a measuring body for measuring the mass of the intake air, said measuring body being capable of being inserted into the clean duct of the intake line of an internal combustion engine and having a flow duct which is divided essentially into a measuring duct narrowing in the direction of flow and a S-shaped deflecting duct adjoining the latter. The measuring element is arranged in the narrowing measuring duct. As is known, for example, from DE 43 38 891 Al, the measuring element may be designed as a micromechanical sensor part with a dielectric diaphragm. EP0708315A2 discloses thermal-type air flow measuring instrument. US 4,433,576 discloses an airflow sensor for a constant temperature anemometer.   EP0173461A1  discloses a thermal diffusion fluid flow sensor.<br><br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
By contrast, the advantage of the device according to the invention, is that the measuring element is prevented in a simple way from being subjected to dirt particles and liquid, without adverse pressure losses occurring. Whilst the dirt particles and liquid droplets carried along by the medium, for example the intake air of an internal combustion engine, are detained by the protective sieve and diverted into a region oi" the air flow or of the inner duct wall which does not impinge onto the measuring element, the flowing intake air passes, virtually unimpeded, through the protective sieve to the measuring element.<br>
Advantageous developments and improvements of the device are described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for measuring at least one parameter of a medium flowing in a conduit, in particular the intake-air mass of an internal combustion engine, having a tubular body, disposed in a conduit and experiencing the flow of the medium through it in the flow direction, and having a measuring element bathed by the medium and disposed in a throughflow duct of the tubular body, the flowing medium in the throughflow duct having regions of flow, at least one of the regions of flow is in contact with the measuring element, characterized in that at least partly upstream of the measuring element, a protective sieve is disposed inside the throughflow duct of the tubular body and has sieve orifice with center lines, which when the protective sieve is disposed in the tubular body extend in inclined fashion relative to the flow direction, so that dirt particles and liquid droplets entrained by the flowing medium are diverted downstream of the protective sieve into a region of the flowing medium which does not come in contact with the measuring element.<br>
One possibility of diverting dirt particles and liquid droplets in a desired direction is advantageously afforded when the protective sieve runs at an inclination in the direction of flow.<br><br>
It is advantageous to provide an open outflow orifice between a downstream end of the protective sieve and an inner duct wall of the throughflow duct, with the result that the liquid intercepted by the protective sieve, together with any dirt particles which have infiltrated, passes into a wall region of the tubular body and is carried along downstream there by the flowing air, wall adhesion being maintained.<br>
It is likewise advantageous for the measuring element to be arranged in a measuring body which projects into the throughflow duct and for the protective sieve to lie completely or only partially upstream of the measuring body, so that liquid droplets and dirt particles are reliably intercepted by the protective sieve and are diverted or led away into the edge region of the tubular body. It is advantageous, furthermore, if the measuring element is arranged in a measuring body which extends along a longitudinal axis and which projects through an insertion orifice in a first wall portion of the tubular body into the throughflow duct in the direction of a second wall portion of the tubular body, and if the protective sieve spans a sieve surface which forms an angle of 
In a further advantageous refinement, the measuring element is arranged in a measuring body which extends along a longitudinal axis and which projects through an insertion orifice in a first wall portion of the tubular body into the throughflow duct in the direction of a second wall portion of the tubular body, the protective sieve spanning a sieve surface which runs approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis, so that liquid droplets and dirt particles led away by<br><br>
the protective sieve are led laterally past the measuring body.<br>
In order to ensure as homogeneous a flow as possible at the measuring element, it is advantageous to arrange a flow straightener in the conduit upstream and/or downstream of the tubular body.<br>
For equalizing the flow, at least two struts which are oriented in the direction of flow and are made flat transverse to the direction of flow are advantageously provided between an inner wall of the conduit and the tubular body.<br>
It is likewise advantageous to provide upstream, near a downstream end of the protective sieve, or downstream of the outflow orifice, in the wall of the tubular body a suction-extraction orifice which leads to the conduit and through which the liquid droplets and dirt particles led away by the protective sieve can be discharged immediately from the tubular body.<br>
Drawing<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in simplified form in the drawing and are explained in more detail in the following description. Figure 1 shows a first exemplary embodiment of a device for measuring the mass of a flowing medium, Figure 2 shows a second exemplary embodiment of a device for measuring the mass of a flowing medium. Figure 3 shows a part-view of a device according to Figure 1 or Figure 2 with a suction-extraction orifice. Figure 4 shows a third exemplary embodiment of a device for measuring the mass of a flowing medium in a part-view, and Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 each show a part-detail of a protective sieve on a different scale.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiments<br><br>
Figure 1 shows, in a partial sectional illustration restricted to the elements essential within the scope of the invention, a first exemplary embodiment of a device, designed according to the invention, for measuring at least one parameter of a medium flowing into a conduit, in particular of the intake-air mass of an internal combustion engine. Here, 1 designates a conduit which may form a direct portion of the intake pipe of the internal combustion engine or is an independent component which can be connected to the intake pipe of the internal combustion engine. In any event, the conduit 1 lies downstream of an air filter, not illustrated, on what is called clean-space side of the latter. The air filter serves for filtering the intake air of the internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle and is intended as fully as possible to prevent the penetration of dirt particles or liquid into the intake pipe.<br>
The conduit 1 possesses a conduit wall 2 having an inner wall 3 by means of which it surrounds the flow duct 4, through which the intake air of the internal combustion engine flows in the direction of flow 5 identified by arrows - Arranged in the conduit 1 is a tubular body 8 which is oriented in the direction of flow 5 and runs, for example, concentrically with the conduit centre line 7 of the conduit 1. The tubular body 8 has a wall 9 which, with an inner duct wall 10, delimits in the tubular body 8 a through flow duct 11, via which part of the air sucked in in the direction of flow 5 flows. The tubular body 8 is held, for example, by at least two struts 12 which extend between the inner wall 3 of the conduit 1 and the wall 9 ol the tubular body 8 transverse to the direction of flow 5 and in this case have a flat plate-like shape. The struts 12, in addition to holding the tubular body 8 in the airflow between the conduit 1 and the tubular body 8, cause an increase in the pressure drop, so that the air quantity flowing through the throughflow duct 11<br><br>
increases, and, secondly, the struts 12 intentionally bring about a straightening of the intake-air flow.<br>
The  air  mass  sucked  in  by  the  internal combustion engine can be varied arbitrarily by means of a throttle valve, not illustrated, arranged downstream of the tubular body 8  in the intake pipe of  the internal combustion engine. A measurable parameter of the flowing medium may be the mass (mass flow) of the flowing medium flowing per unit time, for example the intake-air mass of an internal combustion engine.  In order to determine the intake-air mass of the internal combustion engine,  a measuring body 15 is provided which is of essentially elongate and parallelepipedic design and which extends along a longitudinal axis 16, The longitudinal axis 16 runs essentially perpendicular to the conduit centre line 7 and therefore also to the direction of flow 5. The measuring body 15 is inserted partially through a holding orifice 17 in the conduit wall 2 and an insertion orifice 18 in the wall 9 of the tubular body 8 and projects with a measuring end 19 into the throughflow duct 11. A plug end 22 of the measuring  body  15,  said  plug  end  receiving  the electrical connections, for example in the form of plug tongues, remains in this case outside the conduit 1. The insertion orifice 18 of the tubular body 8 is formed in a first wall portion 23, opposite which a second wall portion 24 of the tubular body lies in the direction of the longitudinal axis 16. Provided in a known way in the measuring end 19 of the measuring body 15 is a measuring element 25 which is in contact with the air flowing through the throughflow duct 11 and by means of which the air mass sucked in by the internal combustion engine is determined. The measuring element 25 may be designed in a known way, for example in the form   of   thermally   coupled   temperature-dependent resistors. In particular, as shown by way of example in DE 43 38 891 Al, it is possible to design the measuring element 25 as a micromechanical component having a<br><br>
dielectric diaphragm on which the resistance elements are formed.<br>
Other measurable parameters of the flowing medium are, for example, its temperature, pressure and the like. For this purpose, the measuring element 25 may be designed, for example, in the same way as those in DE 42 37 224 Al, DE 43 17 312 Al, DE 197 11 939 Al or DE 197 31 420 Al,<br>
In order to prevent the measuring element 25 from being subjected undesirably to dirt particles or liquid, a protective sieve 28 is arranged at least partially upstream of the measuring element 25 within the throughflow duct 11 of the tubular body 8. The protective sieve 28 has, for example, a circular or elliptically oval shape and spans a sieve surface 2 9 towards the intake air. In this case, in the first exemplary embodiment, the protective sieve 28 extends from the first wall portion 23 of the tubular body 8 towards the second wall portion 24 and, for example, is inclined relative to the longitudinal axis 16 and the direction of flow 5 or the conduit centre line 7 in such a way that the sieve surface 29 runs at an inclination in the direction of flow 5 and forms with the longitudinal axis 16 and angle which is smaller than 90°. In the first exemplary embodiment, the protective sieve 28 is arranged in such a way that it lies completely upstream of the measuring element 25. However, as illustrated in the second exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, the protective sieve 28 may also be arranged in such a way that it lies only partially upstream of the measuring body 15. As a result of the inclination of the protective sieve 28, the protective sieve 28 has a downstream end 30 which, in the first exemplary embodiment, is directed towards the second wall portion 24 of the tubular body 8. Between the downstream end 30 and the inner duct wall 10 of the tubular body 8 is provided an open outflow orifice 31 which is formed either due to the fact that<br><br>
the downstream end 30 terminates with a clearance relative to the inner duct wall 10 or due to the fact that, although the downstream end 30 projects as far as the inner duct wall 10, the outflow orifice 31 is cut out from the protective sieve 28 or the inner duct wall 10. To form the protective sieve 28, it is possible for there to be both a close-mesh wire netting and a thin plate having sieve orifices 32 arranged in sieve form. Plastic, metal, ceramic or glass may be used as material both for the wire netting and for the platelike protective sieve 28. The plate-like protective sieve 28 made from plastic may be produced, for example, by injection moulding or by the sieve orifices 32 being introduced by means of a material-removing method. The plate-like protective sieve 2 8 made of metal may be produced, for example, from sheet metal by punching, erosion, drilling, etc,, and there may also be provision for the edge elements 33 surrounding the sieve orifices 32 to be inclined somewhat relative to the sieve surface 29 by bending (Figures 7 and 8). When the intake air entering the throughflow duct 11 of the tubular body 8 contains dirt particles and liquid droplets, these are in part precipitated on the sieve surface 2 9 and move mainly to the downstream end 30 of the protective sieve 28, this taking place both on a front face 35, facing the direction of flow 5, of the sieve surface 29 and on a back face 36 lying in the direction of flow 5. This liquid precipitation 42 (Figures 5, 6 and 7) is carried along from the downstream end 30 by the intake air, for example, into the outflow orifice 31 and adheres predominantly to the inner duct wall 10, along which the intake air transports the liquid, also bearing very fine dirt particles and in the form of very fine liquid droplets or of a thin liquid film, further along in the direction of flow 5 past the measuring element 25 to the tube end 37 downstream of the measuring body 15, from which the precipitated liquid comes loose and is<br><br>
transported by the surrounding flowing intake air to the internal combustion engine. Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 illustrate part-details of the protective  sieves  2 8 according to Figures 1 to 4 on a different scale. Here, in the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 5, the protective sieve 28 and the sieve orifices  32  are inclined with their centre lines 41 relative to the direction of flow 5 and therefore also relative to the conduit centre line 7. If, then, liquid droplets 43, illustrated in Figure 5 as a small circle, and dirt particles, which are carried along in the flow, impinge onto the edge elements 33 around the sieve orifices 32, these form the liquid precipitations 42, illustrated by broken lines, on the front face 35 and travel partially through the sieve orifices 32 to the back face 36, where they slide further on and arrive at the inner duct wall 10 or travel in the direction of the centre line 41 of the sieve orifices 32 from the protective sieve 28 in the direction of the inner duct wall 10 (see Figure 7, the broken trajectory 45 of the upper liquid  droplet  43).  Liquid  droplets  43  and  dirt particles which are introduced directly into the sieve orifices 32 by the airflow impinge onto a sieve orifice wall 4 4 and are deflected, downstream of the protective sieve 28, along a broken trajectory 4 5 depicted by way of  example,   the  trajectory  4 5  being  directed, downstream of the protective sieve 28,  towards  the inner duct wall 10, that is to say past the measuring body 15.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 6, although the sieve orifices 32 are inclined with their centre lines 41 relative to the direction of flow 5, the protective sieve 28 is oriented perpendicular or virtually perpendicular to the direction of flow 5, but the same effects as regards the airflow and the leading away of the liquid droplets 4 3 and dirt particles as in the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 5 are obtained. As also shown in<br><br>
Figure 6, the inclination of the sieve orifices 32 with their centre lines 41 may be different and run in different directions. The liquid passing through the protective sieve 28 and precipitated on the inner duct wall 10, in addition to the flowing movement in the direction of flow 5, is, as a rule, also distributed, downstream of the outflow orifice 31, in the circumferential direction on the inner duct wall 10 and consequently, as a result of the high flow velocity, flows annularly as an extremely thin layer past the measuring body 15. In contrast to the dirt particles and liquid constituents 42, 4 3 intercepted by the protective screen 2 8 in the way described, the intake air passes, virtually unimpeded, through the sieve orifices 32 approximately along the unbroken flow line designated by 4 6 and flows to the measuring element 25, the risk of precipitation of dirt particles and liquid constituents 42, 43 being markedly reduced.<br>
The same reference symbols are used in Figures 7 and 8 for identical and identically acting parts as in the preceding figures, and also the same effects as regards the airflow 4 6 and the leading away of liquid droplets 43 and dirt particles are obtained as in the exemplary embodiments according to Figures 5 and 6. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, the protective sieve 28 is oriented perpendicular or virtually perpendicular to the direction of flow 5, but, as a result of the bending or joggling of the edge elements 33, the sieve orifices 32 are inclined with their centre lines 41 relative to the direction of flow 5. Figure 8 shows a protective sieve 28 according to Figures 5, 6 or 7 with sieve orifices 32 which are designed and arranged in the form of a honeycomb and run at an inclination relative to the direction of flow 5.<br>
Downstream of the tubular body 8, a flow straightener 38 of a known type may be arranged, which extends transverse to the direction of flow 5 through<br><br>
the flow duct 4 of the conduit 1 and serves for ensuring as uniform an airflow as possible at and around the measuring element 25, with the result that a more accurate measurement result can be achieved.<br>
In  the  second  exemplary  embodiment  of  the invention, illustrated in Figure 2, the identical and identically acting parts are identified by the same reference symbols. As compared with Figure 1, in Figure 2 the conduit 1 and the tubular body 8 and also the measuring body 15 are depicted as being rotated through 90°, so that the measuring body 15 and its longitudinal axis 16 extend perpendicular to the drawing plane. As in the first exemplary embodiment according to Figure 1,  in the second exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, too, the protective sieve 28 is arranged in the tubular body 8 so as to run at an inclination to the direction of flow 5 from upstream of the measuring body  15  towards  the  measuring  body  15,  but  said protective sieve lies only partially upstream of the measuring body 15, so that the downstream end 30 of the protective  sieve  28  lies  at  least  level  with  the measuring body 15, as seen in the direction of flow 5. What is achieved thereby is that the liquid or dirt particles  led away by the protective sieve 28  are precipitated onto the inner duct wall 10 of the tubular body 8 at the downstream end 30 in a region of the outflow orifice 31 in which it is ensured that the air flowing past no longer comes into the vicinity of the measuring  element  25.   In  the  second  exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, the protective sieve 2 8 is arranged in the tubular body 8 in such a way that its  spanned  sieve  surface  2 9  runs  approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis 16 of the measuring body  15.  Thus,  in  the  second exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, some of the dirt particles and liquid are led essentially laterally past the measuring body 15,  whilst,  in the first exemplary embodiment according to Figure 1, some of these are led past<br><br>
essentially below the measuring body 15 - In the second exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, too, in which the sieve surface 29 runs approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis 16, it is possible to arrange the protective sieve 28 completely upstream of the measuring element 25. In both exemplary embodiments, the sieve orifices 32 may have different shapes, for example be round or square or rectangular or rhombic or honeycomb-shaped or oval or have another geometric shape.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a part-view of the first exemplary embodiment according to Figure 1, the identical parts being identified by the same reference symbols. In addition to the embodiment of the device according to Figure 1, in the device according to Figure 3 a suction-extraction orifice 39 penetrating the wall 9 and leading to the conduit 1 is provided in the wall 9 of the tubular body 8 downstream of the outflow orifice 31, which suction-extraction orifice has only a small clearance relative to the downstream end 30, as seen in the direction of flow 5, and via which the liquid, together with dirt particles, led away via the outflow orifice 31 is suction-extracted towards the flow duct 4.<br>
The third exemplary embodiment according to Figure 4 likewise corresponds essentially to the first exemplary embodiment according to Figure 1, but differs from this in that the downstream end 30 of the protective sieve 28 does not terminate in front of the inner duct wall 10, but reaches as far as the inner duct wall 10, and in that there is provided upstream, near this downstream end 30, in the inner duct wall 10 of the tubular body 8 a suction-extraction orifice 39 which leads to the conduit 1 and via which dirt particles and liquid led away by the protective sieve 28 are suction-extracted to the flow duct 4 of the conduit 1, without passing downstream of the protective sieve 28.<br><br><br><br><br>
