DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
10<br>
As used herein, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer is the sum of the number of polymer molecules and the squared sum of the individual polymer molecules' molecular weight, divided by the summation of the number of<br>
15  polymer molecules and the sum of the individual polymer molecules' molecular weight.<br>
As used herein, "water-soluble" refers to any material that is sufficiently soluble in water to form a clear or 20  translucent solution to the naked eye at a concentration of 1.0% or more by weight of the material in water at 25°C.<br>
Dendritic Macromolecule<br>
25  Dendritic macromolecules are macromolecules with densely<br>
branched structures having a large number of end groups. A dendritic polymer includes several layers or generations of repeating units which all contain one or more branch points. Dendritic polymers, including dendrimers and hyperbranched<br>
30  polymers, are prepared by condensation reactions of<br>
monomeric units having at least two different types of reactive groups. Dendrimers are highly symmetric, whereas<br><br>
WO 2006/018063<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007016<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
macromolecules designated as hyperbranched may to a certain degree hold an asymmetry, yet maintaining the highly branched treelike structure.<br>
5  Dendritic macromolecules normally consist of an initiator or nucleus having one or more reactive sites and a number of branching layers and optionally a layer of chain terminating molecules. Continued replication of branching layers normally yields increased branch multiplicity and, where 10  applicable or desired, increased number of terminal groups. The layers are usually called generations and the branches dendrons.<br>
Compositions of the invention comprise a hydrophobically 15  functionalised dendritic macromolecule.  Preferred<br>
hydrophobic groups are carbon based. C4-C24 alkyl or alkenyl groups are preferred hydrophobic groups, more preferred are C6-C22 alkyl or alkenyl groups, especially preferred are Cs~ Ci6 alkyl or alkenyl groups, most preferred are dendritic 20  macromolecule having C10-C14 alkyl or alkenyl groups. The hydrophobic groups may include linear and branched hydrophobes as well as arylalkyl groups, however it is preferred if the alkyl hydrophobic groups are linear. The hydrophobic groups may be unsaturated groups but are 25  preferably saturated.  The hydrophobic groups are sometimes linked to the dendritic macromolecule through linking groups, suitable linking groups include ester or amide groups.<br>
30  In some instances it is preferred if the dendritic macromolecule is fully or partially hydrophobically functionalised at the periphery and/or the terminal groups<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/007016<br><br>
-   17   -<br>
particularly useful cationic surfactant for use in conditioners according to the invention is behenyltrimethylainmonium chloride, available commercially, for example as GENAMIN KDMP, ex Clariant. 5<br>
Another example of a class of suitable cationic surfactants for use in the invention, either alone or together with one or more other cationic surfactants, is a combination of an amidoamine and an acid.<br>
10<br>
Preferred amidoamines useful herein include stearamido-propyldimethylamine, stearamidopropyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldimethylamine, palmitamidopropyldimethylamine, palmitamidopropyl-<br>
15  diethylamine, palmitamidoethyldiethylamine,<br>
palmitamidoethyldimethylamine, behenamidopropyldimethyl-amine, behenamidopropyldiethylmine, behenamidoethyldiethyl-amine, behenamidoethyldimethylamine, arachidamidopropyl-dimethylamine, arachidamidopropyldiethylamine, arachid-<br>
20  amidoethyldiethylamine, arachidamidoethyldimethylamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred amidoamines useful herein are stearamidopropyldimethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, 25  and mixtures thereof.<br>
Acid (ii) may be any organic or mineral acid which is capable of protoriating the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition.  Suitable acids useful herein include 30  hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the acid is selected from the group<br><br>
WO 2006/018063<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007016<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
consisting of acetic acid, tartaric acid, hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitably, the acid is included in a sufficient amount to 5  protonate all the amidoamine present, i.e. at a level which is. at least equimolar to the amount of amidoamine present in the composition.<br>
In conditioners of the invention, the level of cationic 10  surfactant will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, more<br>
preferably 0.05 to 7.5%, most preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Conditioners of the invention will typically also 15  incorporate a fatty alcohol.  The combined use of fatty alcohols and cationic- surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a lamellar phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed. 20<br>
Representative fatty alcohols comprise, from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Fatty alcohols are typically compounds containing straight chain alkyl groups. Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, 25  stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The use of these<br>
materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
30  The level of fatty alcohol in conditioners of the invention will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 8%, more preferably from 0.2 to 7%, most preferably from<br><br>
WO 2006/018063<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007016<br><br>
-  19  -<br>
0.3 to 6% by weight of the composition.  The weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 1:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:1.5 to 1:8, optimally from 1:2 to 1:5. If the weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty 5  alcohol is too high, this can lead to eye irritancy from the composition. If it is too low, it can make the hair feel squeaky for some consumers. .<br>
Further Conditioning Agents 10<br>
Compositions of the invention may comprise further conditioning agents to optimise wet and dry conditioning benefits.<br>
15  Particularly preferred further conditioning agents are silicone emulsions.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions include those formed from silicones such as polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular<br>
20  polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone, polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol, and amino-functional polydimethyl siloxanes which have the CTFA designation amodimethicone.<br>
25<br>
The emulsion droplets may typically have a Sauter mean droplet diameter (D3,2) in the composition of the invention ranging from 0.01 to 20 micrometer, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 micrometer.<br><br>
WO 2006/018063<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007016<br><br>
-  20  -<br>
A suitable method for measuring the Sauter mean droplet diameter (03,2) is by laser light scattering using an . instrument such as a Malvern Mastersizer.<br>
5  Suitable silicone emulsions for use in compositions of the invention are available from suppliers of silicones such as Dow Corning and GE Silicones. The use of such pre-formed silicone emulsions is preferred for ease of processing and . control of silicone particle size. Such pre-formed silicone<br>
10  emulsions will typically additionally comprise a suitable emulsifier such as an anionic or nonionic emulsifier, or • mixture thereof, and may be prepared by a chemical emulsification process such as emulsion polymerisation, or by mechanical emulsification using a high shear mixer. Pre-<br>
15  formed silicone emulsions having a Sauter mean droplet<br>
diameter (D3,2) of less than 0.15 micrometers are generally termed microemulsions.<br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed silicone emulsions include 20  emulsions DC2-1766, DC2-1784, DC-1785, DC-1786, DC-1788 and microemulsions DC2-1865 and DC2-1870, all available from Dow Corning.. These are all emulsions/microemulsions of dimethiconol. Also suitable are amodimethicone emulsions such as DC939 (from Dow Corning) and SME253.(from GE 25  Silicones).<br>
Also suitable are silicone emulsions in which certain types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular ' weight have been blended with the silicone emulsion<br>
30  droplets, as described for example in WO03/094874. In such materials, the silicone emulsion droplets are preferably formed from polydiorganosiloxanes such as those described<br><br>

above.   One preferred form of the  surface  active block copolymer  is   according  to  the   following  formula:<br>
H0(CH2CH20)x(CHCH20)y(CH2CH20)x  H<br>
5	1<br>
CH3<br>
wherein the mean value of x is 4 or more and the mean value of y is 25 or more. 10<br>
Another preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
(HO (CH2CH20) a (CHCH20) b) 2-N-CH2-CH2-N ( (OCH2CH) b (OCHCH2) a0H) 2<br>
15	I	I<br>
CH3	CH3<br>
wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is 6 or more. 20<br>
Mixtures of any of the above described silicone emulsions may also be used.<br>
Silicone will generally be present in a composition of the 25  invention at levels of from 0.05 to 10%, preferably 0.05 to 5%, more preferably from 0.5 to 2% by total weight of-silicone based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Other Optional Ingredients 30<br>
A composition of the invention may contain other ingredients for enhancing performance and/or consumer acceptability. Such ingredients include fragrance, dyes and pigments, pH adjusting agents, pearlescers or opacifiers, viscosity<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
In-vitro test method<br>
5  Laser Volume Experiment  (Switches  treated with  shampoo and/or conditioner)<br>
Base Wash<br>
2g/10" European hair	switches were base washed using a 14/2<br>
10  SLES/CAPB solution.	5 switches were grouped together and<br>
wetted under running	water at 35-40°C. The excess water was<br>
removed by running thumb and forefinger along the length of the switch. 1ml of base was applied along the length of the switch and agitated for 30 seconds. The switch was rinsed 15 under the warm running water for 30 seconds and then a further 1ml of SLES/CAPB was applied and agitated for another 30 seconds. The switch was given a final rinse for 1 minute.<br>
20  Shampoo Treatment<br>
5 switches were grouped together and 1ml of shampoo was placed along the length of the switch. The switch was agitated for 30 seconds, followed by a rinse for 30 seconds. Another 1ml of shampoo was placed along the length of the<br>
25 switch and agitated for 30 seconds, followed by a rinse for 1 minute. The switches were combed through whilst suspended vertically from a clamp stand, the switch was smoothed by running thumb and forefinger along the length of the switch and then allowed to dry naturally overnight.<br>
30  Note 5 switches were used per treatment.<br><br>

Conditioner Treatment<br>
5 switches were grouped together and base washed as above with 14/2 shampoo, then 2mls of conditioner was placed along the length of the switch and agitated for 1 minute followed 5 by a rinse for 1 minute. The switches were combed through whilst suspended vertically from a clamp stand, the switch was smoothed by running thumb and forefinger along the length of the switch and then allowed to dry naturally overnight. 10<br>
Laser Measurements<br>
Each switch was suspended vertically from a clamp stand and a 2 mW, XD= 632.8nm Helium-Neon laser shone perpendicular to the untouched switch approximately 2" from the bottom of the<br>
15 switch. The laser illuminated a cross-section of the switch creating a two dimensional image of white dots on a dark background with each dot representing a single hair fibre. The illuminated image was recorded onto an optical disc using a 35mm camera.<br>
20<br>
Analysis<br>
A macro was used to set the discrimination level for each image, (i.e. the threshold value for a clear image resulting in the no. of dots stored onto the disc) and then calculate<br>
25 the x,y co-ordinates of every dot on the image. Another macro in Excel applied a mathematical transformation on all the co-ordinates, to convert the co-ordinates from their apparent position relative to the camera to their actual position in the switch. These actual co-ordinates were used<br>
30  to calculate the mean radial distribution of all the co-<br><br>
