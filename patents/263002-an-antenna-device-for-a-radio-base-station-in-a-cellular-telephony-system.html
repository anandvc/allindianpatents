				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention discloses an antenna device for a radio base station in a<br>
cellular telephony system. The device comprises a first and a second input<br>
connection for a first and a second data stream, and a first and a second<br>
polarization former, one for each of said data streams, as well as a first and a<br>
second antenna of respective first and second polarizations.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In known radio base stations for cellular telephony networks, there is a number of<br>
so called radio chains, each radio chain comprising a power amplifier, which may<br>
itself be comprised of a number of amplifiers which are connected so as to have a<br>
common input port and a common output port. Each radio chain will typically<br>
also comprise one or more antenna elements, which may be a part of a larger<br>
antenna with more antenna elements, such as an electrically steerable array<br>
antenna.<br>
In future radio base stations, it would be an advantage if the stations could<br>
support both so called BF-transmission (beam forming), where typically one data<br>
stream is transmitted to each user, as well as so called MIMO-transmissions<br>
(Multiple Input, Multiple Output), where a plurality of data streams are<br>
transmitted to each user.<br>
The antenna requirements for BF-transmissions are quite different from those of<br>
MIMO-transmissions, so a conventional way of designing a radio base station<br>
which would be capable of both would be to have separate antennas for each case,<br>
as well as separate radio chains for each antenna or a switching device between<br>
the power amplifier resource and the antennas.<br>
Since MIMO and BF would typically not be used simultaneously, this design<br>
would lead to a radio base station with poor usage of power amplification<br>
2<br><br>
resources, as well as a radio base station with quite voluminous equipment,<br>
neither of which is desirable.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As discussed above, there is a need for an antenna device for a radio base station<br>
in a cellular telephony system that could be used in a versatile fashion for either<br>
MIMO or BF, or possibly both at the same time.<br>
This need is addressed by the present invention in that it discloses an antenna<br>
device for a radio base station in a cellular telephony system, comprising a first<br>
and a second input connection for a first and a second data stream, and a first and<br>
a second polarization former, one for each of said data streams.<br>
The device of the invention also comprises a first and a second antenna of<br>
respective first and second polarizations, as well as one amplifier for each of the<br>
antennas. The device additionally comprises a first and a second combiner, so that<br>
the outputs from the polarization formers may be combined as inputs to each of<br>
the first and second antennas.<br>
Suitably, each of the first and second antennas each comprise one or more<br>
radiation elements which can have the same phase center.<br>
By means of the invention, as will become more apparent from the following<br>
detailed description, a more efficient use of the amplifiers is made possible, due in<br>
part to the use of the polarization formers and the combiners of the device.<br>
Since antennas of different polarizations are used for transmitting one and the<br>
same signal, as will be explained in more detail in the following, the signals will be<br>
combined in the air after transmission into resulting polarizations. In this way, the<br>
signal losses associated with more traditional types of signal combining are<br>
avoided.<br>
3<br><br>
Beamforming can also be carried out in certain embodiments of the device of the<br>
invention, since, in said embodiments, at least one of the first or second antennas<br>
additionally comprises at least one more radiation element of the same<br>
polarization as the first antenna element of that antenna, the device additionally<br>
comprising a beamformer for that antenna.<br>
Thus, by means of the invention, either beamforming or MIMO transmission, or<br>
possibly both, can be carried out by means of the same physical equipment.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following, with reference to<br>
the appended drawings, in which:<br>
Figs l and 2 show background art, and<br>
Fig 3 shows different polarizations and their combinations, and<br>
Fig 4 shows a basic embodiment of an antenna device, and<br>
Fig 5 shows a first basic embodiment of the invention, and<br>
Figs 6-9 show various embodiments of the invention which utilize beam forming.<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig l shows a system 100 which serves to illustrate some of the components used<br>
in the invention: a data stream Di is to be transmitted to a user of a cellular<br>
telephony network. In order to achieve this, the device 100 comprises a first<br>
antenna 130, in this case comprised of a single antenna element of a certain<br>
polarization, in this case vertical polarization, as indicated in the drawing. The<br>
single antenna element 130 may be replaced by more antenna elements of the<br>
same polarization, but will here be shown and referred to as a single element.<br>
The antenna element 130 is associated with a power amplifier 120, in order to<br>
amplify the signal to a desired level before the transmission. As indicated by a<br>
dashed line, the antenna 100 might also comprise more radiation elements,<br>
4<br><br>
suitably of another polarization. In this case, since no such additional antenna<br>
elements are comprised in the antenna, the dashed line is terminated with a "o".<br>
These additional antenna elements may, in similarity to the antenna element 130,<br>
also be replaced by more antenna elements of the same polarization, but will here<br>
be shown and referred to as a single element.<br>
The device 100 also comprises a so called Polarization Former (PF) 110, which<br>
serves to shape the composite polarization of the transmitted signal if the antenna<br>
comprises antenna elements of different polarizations. Since the antenna of fig 1<br>
only comprises a single antenna element, the PF essentially serves no function in<br>
the device shown, but is still shown in the drawing.<br>
As indicated, however, the PF can divide the incoming data stream, in this case D1,<br>
between antenna elements of different polarizations, and then subject the divided<br>
data streams to a multiplication function which will be elaborated upon later in<br>
this description. In the present case, the data stream which would go to the "non-<br>
existent" antenna element at the end of the dashed line is multiplied by zero.<br>
In conclusion, the entire data stream D1 in fig 1 is transmitted by the vertically<br>
polarized antenna element130, after being amplified by a power amplifier 120.<br>
For the sake of clarity, fig 2 shows how a second data stream, D2, is transmitted by<br>
means of a device 200 similar to the device 100 of fig 1: all of the components of<br>
the device 100 are present in the device 200, so they will not be described at depth<br>
again here. However, the antenna element 230 of the device 200 is of a different<br>
polarization than the one in fig 1, in this case the polarization is horizontal.<br>
Accordingly, D2 is transmitted with horizontal polarization from the antenna 230<br>
after having been amplified by a power amplifier 220.<br>
Fig 3 illustrates the effect of transmitting signals of different polarizations<br>
simultaneously: a first signal is transmitted with vertical polarization ("V"), and a<br>
second signal is transmitted with horizontal polarization ("H"). If the two signals<br>
are transmitted "in phase", i.e. with no phase shift between them, the composite<br>
5<br><br>
signal as seen by a viewer who is standing in front of and looking at the antenna<br>
will be combined into the polarization referred to as "X" and shown as +45 °.<br>
However, if a phase shift of 180 ° is introduced into one of the signals, e.g. the<br>
signal which is transmitted with horizontal polarization, the composite signal seen<br>
in the same "front view" as described above will be combined into the polarization<br>
referred to as "Y", and shown as -45°.<br>
It should be pointed out that the two polarizations described here, i.e. horizontal<br>
and vertical, are merely examples: any two polarizations may be used, and the two<br>
polarizations used need not be orthogonal to each other, although this is<br>
preferred. Also, the phase shifts introduced need not be o°/180°, if other<br>
composite polarizations are desired, other phase shifts which will give the desired<br>
composite polarizations may be used, e.g. o°/+9O°, giving circular polarization.<br>
Thus, as seen in fig 3, by introducing a phase shift in one of two signals<br>
transmitted in different polarizations, any desired resulting polarization may be<br>
achieved.<br>
Fig 4 shows a basic embodiment of an antenna device 400 of the invention: the<br>
main difference between the device 400 shown in fig 4 and the devices 100, 200,<br>
shown previously is that the device 400 comprises an antenna with two radiation<br>
elements 430,432.<br>
As with the previous example, each of the two antenna elements 430, 432, may<br>
also symbolize a larger number of elements of the same polarization. This will be<br>
true of other embodiments shown and described later in this text as well - one<br>
antenna elements may symbolize a larger number of elements.<br>
The first antenna element is vertically polarized, and the second antenna element<br>
432 is horizontally polarized, but the two antenna elements have the same phase<br>
center.<br>
6<br><br>
A general principle which applies to a device of the invention can be pointed out<br>
here: In order to create a certain desired resulting polarization using two antennas<br>
of different inherent polarizations, there must be a desired phase relation between<br>
the signals transmitted by the antennas. One condition for achieving this is that<br>
the two antenna elements have the same phase center.<br>
The device also comprises one power amplifier 420, 422, per radiation element<br>
and polarization in the antenna. Thus, in this example, there are two power<br>
amplifiers.<br>
The device 400 also comprises the polarization forming (PF) device 410 shown<br>
previously. The PF-device shown in fig 4 divides the incoming data stream D1 into<br>
two equal streams, each of which is to be transmitted via one of the antennas 430,<br>
432. Thus, there will be one data stream on each of the two polarizations used.<br>
As shown in fig 3 and described above, the PF can, by introducing a phase shift<br>
into one of the D1-streams, achieve a certain composite polarization between the<br>
signals transmitted by the two radiation elements 430, 432.<br>
As illustrated by the parenthesis in the PF-function in fig 4, the PF-function in this<br>
case does not introduce any phase shift into either of the signals going to the<br>
separate antenna elements, each signal is merely multiplied by a factor 1, as<br>
indicated by the numerals in the parenthesis. Thus, the composite polarization<br>
achieved by the signals in this example will be the one shown as +45 ° in fig 3.<br>
Fig 5 shows an embodiment of a device 500 of the invention: the device 500<br>
comprises input connections for two data streams D1 and D2. For each of said<br>
data streams, the device 500 comprises one polarization former 510, 511. In<br>
addition, the device 500 comprises two antennas each comprising one radiation<br>
element where the two elements have different polarizations, in this case one 530<br>
of vertical polarization and one 532 of horizontal polarization.<br>
7<br><br>
Each of the radiation elements 530, 532, is associated with one power amplifier,<br>
520,522.<br>
Each of the polarization formers (PF:s) 510, 511, will split its respective data<br>
stream into two separate streams, and can create a phase shift between the two<br>
separate streams, for example by multiplying one of the streams with a complex<br>
number, exp (-jn*:p), where n is an integer, positive or negative. Naturally, the<br>
same can be achieved by multiplying both of the separate streams by complex<br>
numbers if the desired phase difference is maintained between the two complex<br>
numbers. Another way of achieving a phase difference is to introduce a delay into<br>
one of the data streams.<br>
Thus, the output from each of the PF:s 510, 511, will be two streams containing the<br>
same data, but with a desired phase relation between them.<br>
As indicated in fig 5, an example of the use of the two PF:s is that the PF which is<br>
used for the first data stream D1 doesn't introduce a phase difference between the<br>
two separate streams into which D1 is split, i.e. the PF 510 carries out a<br>
multiplication of the "D1-streams" by the PF-factors (1,1), as indicated by the<br>
numerals (1,1) in the parenthesis in the PF 510 in fig 5. Accordingly, the output<br>
from PF 510 is a first and a second stream of D1, with no phase shift between<br>
them.<br>
The other PF in the device 500, the PF 511, on the other hand, introduces a phase<br>
difference between the two data streams into which D2 is split, in this case a phase<br>
shift of 1800 between the two D2-streams which are output from the PF 511.<br>
Thus, the output from PF 511 is a first and a second D2-stream, with a phase<br>
difference of -180 ° between them, which is also indicated by the numerals (1,-1) in<br>
the parenthesis in the PF 511 in fig 5.<br>
As shown in fig 5, the device 500 also comprises a first 515 and a second 516<br>
combiner, which are used to combine the outputs from the polarization formers,<br>
8<br><br>
to form inputs to each of the first 530 and second 532 antenna elements via<br>
respective power amplifiers 520,522.<br>
Thus, one of the two output streams from each PF 510, 511, is input to one of the<br>
combiners. This means that to the first combiner 515, the input is the first "D1-<br>
stream" and the first "D2-stream", and for the second combiner 516, the input is<br>
the "second D1-stream" and the second "D2-stream".<br>
Consider now the two D1-streams: both D1-streams will pass through a respective<br>
power amplifier 520, 522, and will be transmitted from separate antennas<br>
530, 532, having different polarizations, one being vertical and the other being<br>
horizontal. The two Di-streams will thus be combined in the air after being<br>
transmitted in the way shown in fig 3, i.e. in the manner referred to as +45°, since<br>
no phase shift was introduced by the PF:s.<br>
If, instead, the two D2-streams are considered, the following will be realized: the<br>
first and second D2-streams will also pass through the first 515 and second 516,<br>
combiners respectively, as well as the respective first 520 and second 522 power<br>
amplifiers and antenna elements 530,532.<br>
However, the PF 511 introduced a phase shift of 180 ° between the two D2-<br>
streams. Due to this phase shift, the two D2-streams will after transmission<br>
combine in the way referred to as -45 ° in fig 3.<br>
Accordingly, the device 500 of fig 5 will transmit in two effective polarizations, one<br>
of which is -450 and the other is +45°, with one data stream D1, D2, on each of<br>
these polarizations.<br>
Since both data streams, or, to be more correct, both the first and second outputs<br>
from the two PF:s 510, 511, are input to the power amplifiers 520, 522, the power<br>
amplifier resources are shared between the data streams D1 and D2. If the<br>
amplifier resources, in terms of maximal output power, of one amplifier is denoted<br>
as P, the total amplifier resources used is 2P.<br>
9<br><br>
Fig 6 shows a further embodiment 600 of a device according to the invention: the<br>
embodiments shown previously have only comprised one antenna element per<br>
polarization, vertical and horizontal. As shown in fig 6, it is entirely possible to<br>
instead have two antenna elements in one or (as shown in fig 6) both of the<br>
polarizations. The two antenna elements for each polarization constitute an array<br>
antenna.<br>
Thus, the numerals 630 and 632 in fig 6 refer to array antennas with two elements<br>
per polarization, vertical and horizontal. Naturally, the number of radiation<br>
elements per polarization can be varied in a more or less arbitrary way.<br>
As is well known within antenna theory, with two or more radiation elements in<br>
one and the same polarization, it is possible to perform so called beam forming,<br>
i.e. to influence the shape of the resulting radiation pattern in that polarization by<br>
weighting the signals which are fed to the respective radiation element.<br>
The device 600 comprises means for beam forming, one beam former (BF) 652 for<br>
the first data stream D1, and a second beam former 656 for the second data stream<br>
D2. Additional beam formers, which will be described later in this text, are<br>
indicated with dashed lines, and referred to by the numbers 650, 654.<br>
As indicated in fig 6, each of the two output data streams from each of the two<br>
PF:s 610, 611, is used as input to one beam former 652, 656. In this example, the<br>
PF multiplies one of the outgoing data streams by zero, so there is only one<br>
effective data stream output from each PF in this example.<br>
The BF splits each incoming data stream into parallel data streams, and<br>
introduces a phase shift (and possibly an amplitude difference) between the<br>
output data streams, in this case two.<br>
10<br><br>
As shown in fig 6, using the BF 652 as an example, two data streams D1 are output<br>
from the BF, with the described phase shift between them. These two data streams<br>
D1 are each used as input to one of the radiation elements in one of the<br>
polarizations, in this case the vertically polarized elements 630. Each radiation<br>
element is also equipped with one combiner 615 and one PA 620.<br>
Thus, the output from the vertical "array antenna" 630 will be one resulting beam<br>
with a desired shape, used for transmitting data stream D1.<br>
In a similar manner, the horizontal "array antenna" 632 will generate one<br>
resulting beam with a desired shape, used for transmitting data stream D2.<br>
It can be seen that although the polarization formers 610, 611, are comprised in<br>
the device 600 shown in fig 6, they essentially serve no purpose in the device,<br>
since each data stream is only connected to one of the array antennas 630, 632.<br>
To illustrate this further, the "horizontal branch" output of the PF 610 is<br>
multiplied by zero, as is the "vertical branch" output of the PF 611. Thus, the effect<br>
achieved by the embodiment of fig 6 may also possibly be achieved by connecting<br>
the data streams D1-D4 directly to the respective beam formers.<br>
Fig 7 shows a further development 700 of the device introduced in fig 6: the<br>
difference is that in the device 700, all of the beam formers 750, 752, 754, 756, are<br>
employed.<br>
As can be seen in fig 7, the first data stream D1 is input to the first polarization<br>
former 710, where it is split up into two equal streams, with, in this case, no phase<br>
shift being introduced between them. One of the two "in phase" D1 streams is used<br>
as input to a vertical beamformer 752, and the other D1 stream is used as input to<br>
a horizontal beamformer 750. Vertical and horizontal in this context means that<br>
the output from the beamformer will be used as input to an array antenna of that<br>
polarization.<br>
11<br><br>
In a similar manner, the second data stream D2 is input to the second polarization<br>
former 711, where it is split up into two equal streams, with, in this case, a phase<br>
difference of 180 ° between them. The "in phase" D2- stream is used as input to a<br>
vertical beamformer 754, and the "-1800" D2-stream is used as input to a<br>
horizontal beamformer 756.<br>
The device of fig 7 also comprises a first array antenna, 730, with two vertically<br>
polarized radiation elements, and a second array antenna 732 with two<br>
horizontally polarized elements . The two array antennas have the same phase<br>
center. Each radiation element is associated with a combiner 715, 716, and a power<br>
amplifier 720, 722. In total, there are thus four transmission chains in the device<br>
700, each comprising a combiner, an amplifier and a radiation element.<br>
Each beam former 750, 752, 754, 756, will also output a first and a second data<br>
stream, which are used in the following way: The two outputs from the vertical<br>
beam former 752 associated with D1 are used as respective inputs to the two<br>
transmission chains of the vertical array antenna 730, and the two outputs from<br>
the horizontal beam former 750 associated with D1 are used as respective inputs<br>
to the two transmission chains of the horizontal array antenna 732.<br>
Similarly, the two outputs from the vertical beam former 754 associated with D2<br>
are used as respective inputs to the two transmission chains of the vertical array<br>
antenna 730, and the two outputs from the horizontal beamformer 756 associated<br>
with D2 are used as respective inputs to the two transmission chains of the<br>
horizontal array antenna 732.<br>
As a result, each transmission chain in the device 700 is used by both streams D1<br>
and D2. The D1-streams transmitted by the horizontal array antenna 732 and the<br>
D1 streams transmitted by the vertical array antenna 732 have had no phase shift<br>
introduced by the PF 710, and will thus combine in the air after transmission into<br>
the polarization shown as +45 ° in fig 3.<br>
12<br><br>
Conversely, the D2-streams transmitted by the horizontal array antenna 732 and<br>
the D2-streams transmitted by the vertical array antenna 730 have had a phase<br>
shift of -180 ° introduced by the PF 711, and will thus combine in the air after<br>
transmission into the polarization shown as -450 in fig 3. Typically, BF 752=BF<br>
750, and BF 756=BF 754.<br>
An important issue is the flexibility of this configuration: In fig 6 power resources<br>
are dedicated for each data stream, while in fig 7 the entire power resource is<br>
shared by both streams (pooled power resource). A pooled resource can be shared<br>
equally or unequally between the data streams in a device of the invention. <br>
Further, the air combining of signals eliminates the combining loss commonly<br>
associated with a pooled power resource.<br>
Also, the beams generated by the array antennas 730, 732, can have been given a<br>
desired beam shape by the beamformers 750, 752, 754, 756.<br>
Fig 8 shows a further embodiment 800 of the invention. As shown in this<br>
embodiment, the number of data streams used in a device of the invention need<br>
not be restricted to two: in the embodiment 800, as an example of this, four data<br>
streams D1-D4 are used.<br>
Each data stream D1-D4 is used as input to a PF, 810-813, which has the same<br>
function as the PF:s described previously. Thus, the PF:s 810-813 split an<br>
incoming data stream into two, and applies a phase shift and possibly a difference<br>
in amplitude between the two data streams.<br>
In order to facilitate the understanding of the embodiment 800 of the invention,<br>
each PF 810-813 in fig 8 is shown as multiplying one of the outgoing data streams<br>
by zero, so that there is only one data stream output from each PF. Thus, the effect<br>
achieved by the embodiment of fig 8 may also possibly be achieved by connecting<br>
the data streams D1-D4 directly to the respective beam formers.<br>
13<br><br>
Each output data stream from each PF is used as input to a respective beam<br>
former, BF, 852-856. The BF:s of the embodiment 800 have the same function as<br>
those BF:s previously described, and will thus not be described in detail again<br>
here. However, each BF will split an incoming data stream into a first and a<br>
second output data stream.<br>
Each of the first and second output data streams from each of the BF:s 852-856 is<br>
used as input to one of the transmission chains in the device, as shown in fig 8.<br>
The difference between the embodiment 800 and those embodiment shown<br>
previously is that two "beamformed" data streams D1-D2 and D3-D4 respectively,<br>
are combined as input to the same transmission chains after having passed<br>
through a PF where they are subjected to the same polarization forming function.<br>
As can be seen in fig 8, the first and the second data streams D1 and D2, for<br>
example, are subjected to the polarization forming function (1,0) by their<br>
respective PF:s.<br>
After the beam forming, the resulting first data streams D1, D21, formed from<br>
each of D1 and D2 are combined as input to the same transmission chains, as is<br>
also the case with the resulting second data streams D12, D22, formed from each of<br>
D1 and D2.<br>
As the polarization functions are the same for data streams D1 and D2, the beam<br>
forming function BF(D1), BF(D2), to which each of the data streams Di, D2, is<br>
subjected, must be unique for that data stream. Thus, after transmission, there<br>
will be one D1-beam and one D2-beam, both with the same polarization, but<br>
sufficiently different to support MIMO transmissions.<br>
Similarly, the two data streams D3 and D4 are subjected to the same polarization<br>
forming function (0,1), and are then used as input to the same transmission<br>
chains. After transmission, there will be one D3-beam and one D4-beam, both<br>
with the same polarization, but sufficiently different to support MIMO<br>
transmissions.<br>
14<br><br>
Fig 9 shows a further development 900 of the device of fig 8: one difference<br>
between the embodiments 900 and 800 is that in the embodiment 900, the power<br>
amplifier resources are pooled.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, four data streams D1-D4 are input to the device. Each<br>
data stream D1-D4 is input to a polarization former, which splits the input data<br>
stream into a first and a second output data streams. The first output data stream<br>
from each polarization former is used as input to a first beam former BF, and the<br>
second output data stream from each polarization former is used as input to a<br>
second beam former BF.<br>
Accordingly, considering the incoming data stream D1 as an example, this data<br>
stream is, after polarization forming and beam forming, split into a first and a<br>
second D1-stream from a beam former for vertical polarization BF(D1, V), and a<br>
first and a second D1-stream from a beam former for horizontal polarization,<br>
BF(D1, H).<br>
The first and second D1-streams for vertical polarization are input to a first and<br>
second transmission chain, respectively, in an antenna for vertical polarization.<br>
In said first and second transmission chains in the antenna for vertical<br>
polarization, the first and second Di-streams are combined with first and second<br>
streams respectively, from the input data streams D2, D3 and D4.<br>
As indicated in fig 9, the polarization forming functions for D1 and D2 are the<br>
same, as are the polarization forming functions for D3 and D4, respectively. As<br>
pointed out in connection with fig 8, two data streams which have the same PF-<br>
function and which are input to the same antenna must have passed through<br>
different beamforming functions in order to support MIMO transmission.<br>
Streams to be transmitted via horizontally polarized elements are treated<br>
accordingly.<br>
15<br><br>
The invention is not restricted to the examples of embodiments shown above, but<br>
may be varied freely within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
One possible variation, for example, could be to use beamformers which split an<br>
incoming data stream into four output data streams instead of two, as shown<br>
above. Each of the four output data streams would be connected to separate<br>
antenna elements in an array antenna, which would create a narrower beam with<br>
higher gain. Naturally, this principle can be expanded upon, so that beamformers<br>
with even more outputs can be envisioned.<br>
