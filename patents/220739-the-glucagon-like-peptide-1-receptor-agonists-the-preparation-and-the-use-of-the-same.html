The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a group of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. In particularly, the present invention relates to a group of small molecular organic compounds of substituted five-membered heterocyclic ring derivatives which may be used as non-peptide GLP-1R agonists. The compounds of the present invention may be used as medicaments for treating the glycometabolism disturbance-related diseases such as type II diabetes, insensitivity to insulin and obesity etc. And, the present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing the said GLP-1R agonists.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine metabolic disease with heredity tendency. It is caused mainly by the absolute or relative hyposecretion of the insulin, and it causes metabolic disturbance of saccharide, fat, protein, and subsequently vitamin, water and electrolyte. The manifestations include the increase of glycemia and urine glucose, and the patients have the symptoms of polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, dry mouth, and general weakness. The morbidity rate of diabetes mellitus is 1 to 5%, and shows a trend of gradually increasing. Diabetes mellitus, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases are referred as three worldwide serious diseases. The object of treating diabetes mellitus is to correct the disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism, so as to eliminate the symptoms, promote restoration of the function of pancreatic islet, improve the insulin resistance, maintain the better healthy condition and physical strength, and prevent and treat various complications.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is commonly divided into two types: Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (type I, IDDM) and Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (type II, NIDDM). Since the pathogenesis for theses two types of diabetes mellitus are different, the medicaments for treating them are far different, which are stated respectively as follows.<br>
Type I diabetes mellitus is caused by virus infection in hereditarily susceptible person which produce the paradoxical reaction of the islet cells through immunomechanism, so that the pancreatic islets begin to be damaged and even lost their function completely. About 5% of diabetes mellitus is type I. At present, the medicaments for treating type I diabetes mellitus mainly include exogenous insulin (including human insulin and animal insulin), drugs having the insulin-like effect, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), novel long-acting insulin preparation, and Jin Qi hypoglycemic tablet, etc.<br>
A few of type II diabetes mellitus is caused by direct impair of |3-islet cells which<br>
2<br><br>
decreases the secretion of insulin. And most of type II diabetes mellitus is caused by a combination of factors that may include genetic traits, life style, environmental contributors, metabolic disorders, obesity, and so on. In this disease state, muscular, hepatic and adipose tissues are insensitive to the insulin thereby decreasing the intake of the glucose. Most of diabetics suffer from type II diabetes mellitus. At present, the medicaments for the clinical treatment of NIDDM mainly include sulphonylureases, biguanides, other hypoglycemic drugs and adjuvants, etc.<br>
The sulphonylureas hypoglycemic drugs bind to the receptors on the cell membrane of p-islet cells to close the potassium ion channel thereby blocking flowout of potassium ion and inducing depolarization of the cell membrane, so that the calcium ion channels are opened to allow the extracellular calcium ions flow inwardly. The increase of intracellular calcium ions concentration triggers the release of the insulin. Sulphonylureas hypoglycemic drugs can be divided into two generations according to their time of coming into existence. The first generation includes tolpropamide, and the second generation includes glibenclamide (euglucan), gliclazide (diamicron), glipizide and gliquidone etc.<br>
Biguanide hypoglycemic drugs inhibit appetite, improve the binding of insulin to the receptors, promote the anaerobic glycolysis in cells, inhibit tissue respiration and inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis. The biguanide hypoglycemic drugs mainly include metformin, phenformin and buformin.<br>
Other hypoglycemic drugs mainly include thiazolidinedione drugs (such as troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, etc), (33-adrenoceptor regulators, glucagon receptor antagonists, fatty acid metabolism interfering agents, a-glycosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose, voglibose, miglitol), and aldose reductase inhibitors, etc.<br>
Recently, the development of research on glycometabolism related endogenous peptide hormone provides a new idea for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When human body intakes nutrient materials, the enteroendocrine cells release enteropeptide hormone which mainly includes glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and regulates metabolism by affecting the insulin generation, gastrointestinal peristalsis, and islet cell proliferation. Wherein, GLP-1 is secreted by entero-pancreatic cells, and activates the adenylate cyclase to synthesize cAMP by highly specifically binding to the GLP-1 receptor of p-islet cells, so as to further activate the protein kinase. The metabolic signal (glycometabolism) and kinase signal (binding of GLP-1) cooperate on the cell membrane level to finally cause the Ca2+ channel to open and the calcium ions to flow inwardly so that further stimulates the secretion of insulin while inhibiting the generation of glucagon, thereby decrease<br>
3<br><br>
the postprandial blood glucose to maintained blood glucose concentration at a constant level. Also, GLP-1 has the function of neuroregulation, and can retard gastric emptying, and inhibit appetite. All of these are greatly beneficial for control of diabetes mellitus. Normally, GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion depending on the blood glucose concentration. As the blood glucose concentration decreases, the effect of GLP-1 on stimulating insulin secretion decreases. Therefore, the action of GLP-1 on decreasing blood glucose is self-limited, and can not cause hypoglycaemia. So, for treating diabetes mellitus, the medicaments with the GLP-1-like action are greatly desirable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. GLP-1 R agonists have been one researching focus of the international drug development organizations. At present, the researches on GPL-1R mainly focus on the polypeptide regulators. For example, AC 2993 of Amylin Corporation has applied for clinic test in US (IND). AC2993 is a 39-amino acids polypeptide and has the effect of promoting the secretion of insulin as GPL-1. Since the polypeptide drugs is inconvenient for oral administration and is readily to degrade, non-peptides GLP-1 R regulator is the new researching direction at present.<br>

1. Testing the expression of the report gene<br>
Upon that GLP-1R binds to GLP-1 or agonists, its Gasubunit is activated to stimulate the adenylate cyclase, which makes the increase in the concentration of intracellular cAMP. Since the promoter region of the proinsulin gene has the cAMP response element, upon binding of cAMP to this response element, the transcription of the proinsulin gene is activated, so as to increase the sensitivity of 6- islet cells to glucose, and improve the expression and secretion of insulin (Diabetes, 2000, vol.49:1156-1164). The screening model employs the human embryonal nephric cell strain which is stably transfected with the expression vector of GLP-1 R gene and the expression vector of luciferase report gene under the regulation of cAMP response element, to detect its response to the candidate compound (Cell Biology, 1992, Vol.89: 8641-8645; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987, Vol.84: 3434-3438). When screening the candidate compounds, the compound which may induce the luciferase report gene to<br>

The determining result of the concentration of intracellular cAMP is shown in the figure 2. As shown in the figure 2, with increase of the concentration of the compound 2f, the concentration of cAMP which is produced under this stimulation shows an exponential increase. This indicates that the compound 2f has a certain effect on signal transmission of GLP-1R as a GLP-1R agonist. When the concentration of the compound 2f increases to 30uM and 100uM, the concentration of cAMP shows the decreasing trend, which is caused by the cellulotoxic effect of the high concentration of the compound 2f.<br>
3. The test on the ligand-binding activity<br>
In order to determine the binding activity of the compound to the ligand, the cells which highly express GLP-1R are prepared, GLP-1 labelled with 125l is used as the ligand, while adding into the candidate compound. When the candidate compound binds the 125l-labelled GLP-1 competitively, the isotope labels on the cell membrane reduce. Accordingly, the affinity of the candidate compound to the ligand can be evaluated (J Mol Endocrinol. 2000 Vol.25:321-35; J Biomol Screen, 2000 Vol. 5:377-84).<br>
