				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention	relates to a mciroprocessor system with a<br>
processing unit	and a memory which is connected to the<br>
processing unit	in order to execute a reading or writing access<br>
operation.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for operating a<br>
microprocessor system with such a memory.<br>
Microprocessors require a memory in order to store in a permanent<br>
or volatile fashion data or programs which are to be processed.<br>
During the execution of the program, the microprocessor accesses<br>
the memory in order to load currently required program parts or<br>
data. Microprocessors are applied inter alia, in systems which<br>
are critical for security, for example in chip cards. The<br>
microprocessor is used there, inter alia, to encrypt data traffic<br>
or to execute other applications which are critical for security<br>
for the owner of the chip card. Here, data and programs which are<br>
critical for security are stored in the volatile and nonvolatile<br><br>
memory units of the microprocessor. In order to prevent this<br>
information from being monitored without authorization and<br>
displayed, such data is stored in encrypted form. The<br>
encryption method is relatively complex and requires a<br>
corresponding amount of expenditure on hardware and computing<br>
time during the reading and writing access operations to these<br>
memories.<br>
The data which is to be processed at a particular time by the<br>
central processing and control unit (CPU) of the microprocessor<br>
is therefore buffered in further memories which can respond<br>
significantly more quickly. On the one hand, a cache memory is<br>
provied in which data which is to read out of the slower,<br>
encrypted memories or to be written into them is buffered. On the<br>
other hand, registers are provided in which data values or<br>
operational settings which are to be processed at a particular<br>
time are buffered.<br><br>
As the information is to be made available as soon as possible in<br>
the next operating cycle when there is an access request to the<br>
cache memory or one of the registers, encryption of the buffered<br>
information there has previously not been considered. If<br>
conventional encryption methods were to be used for the<br>
encryption of the content of cache memories or registers, the<br>
response time would be too long. For this reason, hitherto the<br>
data has been buffered in cache memories and the working memories<br>
Of the processor in plain te;<t. it is a problem that the data can></t.>
be monitored without authorization by means of suitable measuring<br>
methods.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a microprocessor<br>
arrangement which protects stored data better against<br>
unauthorized monitoring.<br>
A further object of the invention is to specify a method for<br>
operating a microprocessor system with a memory.<br><br>
With respect to the system, this object is achieved by means of a<br>
microprocessor system which comprises: a processing unit, a<br>
memory which is connected to the processing unit for the<br>
execution of a reading or writing access operation; a<br>
cryptagraphic unit for encrypting and decrypting	<br><br>
data values written or read into the memory; means for<br>
providing a variable key, it being possible to control the<br>
means in such a way that the key is changed if there are no<br>
longer any data values to be read out contained in the memory.<br>
With respect to the method, this object is achieved by means<br>
of a method for operating a microprocessor arrangement which<br>
contains a processing unit and a memory which is connected to<br>
the processing unit for executing a reading or writing access<br>
operation and in which, while the memory is being accessed by<br>
the microprocessor arrangement, the data values are encrypted<br>
or decrypted in accordance with a key, and the key is changed<br>
if there is no longer any data to be read out contained in the<br>
memory.<br>
In a microprocessor arrangement according to the invention and<br>
in contrast to known microprocessor arrangements, in addition<br>
a cryptographic unit is inserted into the access path to a<br>
memory, for example a cache memory or a register, which is<br>
connected to the processing unit. The key, which is used to<br>
operate the encryption and decryption, is changed. So that the<br>
reading into and out of the memory can be carried out with the<br>
same key, the key is changed only if there are no longer any<br>
data values to be read out contained in the memory. Because of<br>
the changing key,the encryption method itself can be<br>
relatively easy. The data is stored in the memory in a<br>
nonvolatile fashion so that, even after the supply voltage is<br>
switched off, there is no longer any useable information<br>
present, and repeated attempts at reading out are not<br>
successful. During operation, the available time for<br>
unauthorized monitoring of the key before a key change occurs<br>
is short. Overall, the combination of variable key with a<br>
simple encryption method provides sufficiently high protection<br>
against an attempt at monitoring.<br><br>
The invention is particularly suitable in conjunction with a<br>
further, slower memory in which the data is stored with a<br>
hard, complex encryption. The data is buffered in the memory<br>
which is wired according to the invention in order to provide<br>
it quickly to the central processing unit of the processor.<br>
The further, hard-encrypted memories may be nonvolatile<br>
memories such as ROMs or E2PROMs or volatile RAMs. In<br>
conventional process architectures, the CPU accesses these<br>
memories via a bus. With respect to this, the cache memory is<br>
located between the bus and CPU. When the invention is applied<br>
to a register bank, the registers are connected directly to<br>
the CPU, as in the conventional way. The cache memory is<br>
characterized in that when there is an access request to a<br>
memory which is external, i.e. only accessible via the bus, it<br>
is firstly checked whether the cache memory contains a data<br>
value. If the data value is contained there, it is output to<br>
the processor from the cache memory, and not from the external<br>
memory. If the requested data word is not contained in the<br>
cache memory, the cache memory is first reloaded with the data<br>
value and a suitable environment of this data value, the<br>
requested data value is also output to the CPU. The cache<br>
memory contains for this purpose a memory field in order to be<br>
able to detect the presence of the requested data value. The<br>
memory cells of the memory cell field are static or dynamic<br>
memory cells. A register bank is characterized in that it<br>
contains a multiplicity of registers which can be addressed<br>
directly by the CPU. The registers provide, for example,<br>
operands for logic operations or status and configuration<br>
setting values to be processed in the CPU. The register cells<br>
are embodied as bistable flip-flops.<br>
The safety expenditure for the encryption provides logic<br>
operation elements, expediently exclusive OR gates which are<br><br>
connected into the data lines in the access path of the<br>
memory. The data of the memory which is to stored or read out<br>
is logically linked to a keyword by means of exclusive OR<br>
gates. The keyword is made available by a register which<br>
contains the key which can vary from time to time. The<br>
keywords are preferably generated with random control. For<br>
this purpose, a random generator, which is connected at the<br>
output end to the key register, is used. The random generator<br>
provides the key in a physically random or pseudo-random way.<br>
The random generator is then made to bring about a new keyword<br>
if there is no longer any valid data present in the memory.<br>
This applies, on the one hand, if all the data read into the<br>
memory has already been read out. This also applies, on the<br>
other hand, if the processor is switched over to another<br>
application and re-initialized for this purpose.<br>
Conventionally, the content of the memory would then have to<br>
be completely deleted so that there is no longer any data from<br>
the previous application available for the following<br>
application. In the invention, it is no longer necessary to<br>
initialize the memory by resetting each memory cell. Instead<br>
it is sufficient to change only the key with random control.<br>
The data values contained in the memory can then no longer be<br>
encrypted. It is no longer necessary to reset each individual<br>
memory cell.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference<br>
to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the drawing.<br>
Elements which correspond to one another are provided with<br>
identical reference symbols. In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block circuit diagram of a microprocessor<br>
according to the invention, and<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a cache memory which shows details relevant to<br>
the invention.<br>
The microprocessor according to figure 1 comprises a data bus<br>
1 via which the various functional units of the microprocessor<br>
exchange data, control or programming information with one<br>
another. The data bus 1 comprises a multiplicity of lines for<br>
transferring the useful information and control information. A<br>
central processing unit 2 controls the program sequence and<br>
carries out calculations. Data and program information can be<br>
permanently stored in an invariable fashion in a ROM memory 3<br>
or permanently stored in a variable fashion in an E2PROM 4.<br>
Volatile data is stored in a RAM memory 5. In addition, at<br>
least one peripheral unit 6 is provided in order to receive<br>
data from the outside or output it to the outside. All<br>
functional units are arranged on a single integrated<br>
semiconductor chip. The units 2, ..., 6 are all connected to<br>
the bus 1 and exchange the information to be processed via<br>
said bus 1. The access control to the bus is monitored by a<br>
bus control unit 7.<br>
The data which is stored in the memories 3, 4, 5 is encrypted.<br>
When the data values are output onto the bus, the data is<br>
decrypted and passed on as plain text. For this purpose, a<br>
corresponding encryption and decryption unit 71 (MED = Memory<br>
En/Decryption) is used. When data values are stored in the RAM<br>
memory 5, the unit 71 carries out corresponding encryption. As<br>
the data contained in the memories 3, 4, 5 is available for a<br>
relatively long time in a volatile or nonvolatile fashion, the<br>
cryptographic method executed by the MED unit 71 is<br>
correspondingly complex. Memory access operations last a<br>
relatively long time. As an alternative to the central MED<br>
unit 71, each of the memories 3, 4, 5 can be directly assigned<br>
a cryptographic unit.<br><br>
In order to speed up data access operations to the external<br>
memories 3, 4, 5, a cache memory 8 is provided. The cache<br>
memory 8 lies in the signal path between the bus controller 7<br>
and the CPU 2. The data which is requested by the CPU 2 at a<br>
particular time and a suitable environment of this data are<br>
buffered in the cache memory 8. A read request to one of the<br>
memories 3, 4, 5 is processed in such a way that it is firstly<br>
checked in the cache memory 8 whether it contains the<br>
requested data. If not, the data and the corresponding<br>
environment are reloaded from the external memories into the<br>
cache. If the requested data is contained in the cache 8, the<br>
reloading is omitted.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the cache memory 8 is divided<br>
into an instruction cache memory and a data cache memory. In<br>
the former, instruction sequences of the program which is<br>
being processed at that particular time are buffered, and in<br>
the latter the associated data. In principle, other structures<br>
for the cache memory are also possible. The cache memory can<br>
also be configured as a common cache for instructions and data<br>
(unified cache). In the case of associative cache memory<br>
architecture, such a unit is in turn divided into an<br>
associative memory for the addresses and the associated<br>
instruction/data storage part. By interrogating the<br>
associative memory, it is very quickly detected whether the<br>
requested data is contained in the cache. If the data item is<br>
not present (referred to as a cache miss), a request to reload<br>
is output to the corresponding external memory. Corresponding<br>
processes occur when a data value is written back into the RAM<br>
5.<br>
During the reloading of the cache memory 8, the information<br>
received via the bus 1 is encrypted in plain text by means of<br><br>
a cryptographic unit 61. During a writing operation, the<br>
device 81 decrypts the data stored in encrypted form in the<br>
cache memory 8. When the data stored in encrypted form in the<br>
cache memory 8 is transferred to the CPU 2, it is decrypted by<br>
a cryptographic unit 82. During a writing operation, the unit<br>
82	in the cache memory 8 encrypts information which is to be<br>
buffered. As described below, the key supplied to the<br>
cryptographic units 81, 82 is identical and is changed with<br>
random control if there is no longer any valid data to be read<br>
out in the cache memory 8.<br>
Operators and status information for the CPU 2 are stored in a<br>
register bank 9. The CPU 2 can access directly and immediately<br>
one or more of the registers arranged in the register bank 9.<br>
Data stored there is encrypted or decrypted by a cryptographic<br>
unit 91 when one of the registers of the register bank 9 is<br>
accessed. The key used at a given time in the units 81 and 82<br>
on the one hand and the unit 91 on the other is expediently<br>
different.<br>
The cryptographic units are illustrated in detail by means of<br>
the example of the cache memory 8 in figure 2. A key register<br>
83	contains the key which is being used at a given time. The<br>
key is provided by a random generator 84 which generates the<br>
keyword in a physically genuinely random or pseudo-random<br>
fashion. Respective exclusive OR gates 85a, 85b and 85c are<br>
connected into the data signal lines or bit lines which<br>
conduct the information written into or read out of the cache<br>
memory 8. Each of the exclusive OR gates 85 is in turn<br>
connected to an output of the register 83. The exclusive OR<br>
gates 85 are located both on the side of the cache memory 8<br>
which faces the bus 1 and on the side of the cache memory 8<br>
which faces the CPU 2. When data is read into the cache memory<br>
8, encryption occurs owing to the exclusive OR operation<br><br>
performed on the data values with the keyword supplied from<br>
the register 83. In the case of reading out, the complementary<br>
decryption takes place by means of the same exclusive OR logic<br>
operation with the same keyword. As long as valid data for<br>
reading out is stored in the cache memory 8, the keyword<br>
provided by the register 83 must remain the same without<br>
modification. Each of the n-bit lines corresponds to one bit<br>
of the keyword.<br>
According to the invention, the keyword is changed if the<br>
cache memory 8 does not contain any valid data, i.e. data<br>
which is still to be read out. The random generator 84 is then<br>
activated in order to calculate a new keyword which is<br>
generated with random control. There is no longer any valid<br>
data contained in the memory 8 if all data values stored there<br>
are read out again. Furthermore, the keyword is to be changed<br>
when an initialization of the cache memory 8 is performed,<br>
referred to as a cache flush. A cache flush occurs, for<br>
example, when there is a change in the program executed by the<br>
microprocessor if the application, i.e. the application case<br>
in which the microprocessor is used, changes. In this case, it<br>
is also possible to dispense with a cache flush and a complete<br>
initialization and resetting of all the memory cells of the<br>
cache memory 8 which is brought about by this as the data can<br>
in any case no longer be decrypted owing to a change of the<br>
keyword in the register 83.<br>
The cryptographic unit 91 is constructed in detail in<br>
accordance with one of the cryptographic units in the access<br>
path to the cache memory 8. Its key register is then loaded<br>
with a new random value if all the registers of the register<br>
bank 9 no longer contain any valid data to be read out or have<br>
to be re-initialized.<br><br>
As a result of the invention, increased protection against<br>
unauthorized monitoring is provided to temporarily stored data<br>
in that the data is stored in encrypted form and the key is<br>
changed from time to time. Even when there is a program<br>
sequence which repeats many times, the stored data is<br>
different owing to different keys. The current drawn from the<br>
microprocessor during the execution of the program, in<br>
particular the current peaks or current troughs, varies. As a<br>
result, attempts at unauthorized monitoring which apply an<br>
evaluation of the current profile are made more difficult.<br><br>
