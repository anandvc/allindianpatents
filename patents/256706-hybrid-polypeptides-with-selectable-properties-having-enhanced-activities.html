BELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
The present applicatio <br>
claims filed February 11, 2004, which<br>
The present invention relates polypeptides with selectable <br>
priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/543,407, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirty.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
to peptide chemistry, and more particularly to hybrid pe <br>
rties.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
Central to many metabolic dis« ases and disorders is the regulations of insulin levels and<br><br>
blood glucose levels. Insuli <br>
n termed as incretins, which are glucagon-like peptide-1 ("GLP<br>
ecretion is modulated in part by secretagogue hormones, reduced by enteroendocrine cells. The incretin hormone, 1") is  <br>
a peptide hormone secreted by intestinal cells that<br><br>
has been shown in multiple stx dies to produce an enhancing effect on insulin secretion.<br><br>
GLP-1 is processed from prog<br>
ucagon in the gut and enhances nutrient-induced insulin<br><br>
release (Krcymann B., et ai, Lancet, 2:1300-1303 (1987)).  Various truncated forms of<br>
GLP-1, are known to stimul formation [see, e.g., Mojsov, relationship between various /&gt; human, insulinotropic respons amide, and GLP-1 (7-37) acid Diabetohgia, 36:741-744 (1<br>
te insulin secretion (insulinotropic action) and cAMP S., Int. J. Pep. Pro. Res., 40:333-343 (1992)]. A vitro laboratory experiments and mammalian, especially s to exogenous administration of GLP-1, GLP-1(7-36) has been established (see, e.g., Nauck, M. A., et al., 93); Gutniak, M., et al, New Eng. J. of Med.,<br>
326(20):1316-1322 (1992); Nauck, M. A., et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:301-307 (1993); and<br>
Thorens, B.,etal., Diabetes, 4:<br>
1219-1225(1993)).<br>
i<br>
GLP-1(7-36) amide exerts a ironounced antidiabetogenic effect in insulin-dependent diabetics by stimulating insulin sensitivity and by enhancing glucose-induced insulin release at physiological concen rations (Gutniak M., et al, New Eng. J. Med, 326:1316-1322 (1992)). When administered to non-insulin dependent diabetics, GLP-1(7-36)<br>
amide stimulates insulin release, lowers glucagon secretion, inhibits gastric emptying and enhances glucose utilization (Nauck, 1993; Gutniak, 1992; Nauck, 1993). However, the<br><br>
use of GLP-1 type moleculesfor prolonged therapy of diabetes has been complicated<br><br>
because the serum half-life of such peptides is quite short.<br>
More particularly, GLP-1 is a J30-amino acid peptide derived from proglucagon, a 160-amino acid prohormone. Actions of different prohormone convertases in the pancreas and intestine result in the production of glucagons and other ill-defined peptides, whereas cleavage of proglucagon results in the production of GLP-1 and GLP-2 as well as two other peptides. The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is 100% homologous in all mammals studied so far, implying a critical physiological role. GLP-1 (7-37) acid is C-terminally<br>
GLP-1 (7-36) NH2. The biological effects and metabolic turnover of the free acid GL^-1 (7-37) OH, and the amide, GLP-1 (7-36) NH2, are indistinguishable. By convention, the numbering of the amino acids is based on the processed GLP-1 (1-37) OH f-om proglucagon. The biologically active GLP-1 is the result of further processing: GlLP-1 (7-36) NH2. Thus the first amino acid of GLP-1 (7-<br><br>
37)OHorGLP-l(7-36)NH2is<br><br>
7His.<br><br>
In the gastrointestinal tract, GLP-1 is produced by L-cells of intestinal, colonic and rectal<br><br>
mucosa, in response to stimu<br><br>
ation by intraluminal glucose.   The plasma half-life of<br><br>
active GLP-1 is 
I<br>
peptidase (DPP) IV (CD26) [which cleaves the N-terminal His-Ala dipeptide, thus producing metabolites, GLP-1 j (9-37) OH or GLP-1 (9-36) NH2 which are variously described as inactive, weak agonist or antagonists of GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 R) is a G protein coipled receptor of 463 amino acid and is localized in pancreatic beta cells, in the lungs and to a lesser extent in the brain, adipose tissue and<br>
kidneys.  The stimulation of G,P-1R by GLP-1 (7-37) OH or GLP-1 (7-36)NH2 results<br>
in adenylate cyclase activation, cAMP synthesis, membrane depolarization, rise in intracellular calcium and increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion (Holz et al., 1995).<br>
GLP-1 is a potent insulin secretagogue that is secreted from the intestinal mucosa in response to food intake. The profound incretin effect of GLP-1 is underscored by the fact that GLP-1 R knockout mice an: glucose-intolerant. The incretin response of i.v. infused<br><br>
GLP-1 is preserved in diabetic<br>
subjects, though the incretin response to oral glucose in<br>
these patients is compromised. GLP-1 administration by infusion or sc injections controls fasting glucose levels in diabetic patients, and maintains the glucose threshold for insulin secretion (Gutniak e't al, 1992; Nauck et al, 1986; Nauck et al., 1993). GLP-1 has shown tremendous potential as a therapeutic agent capable of augmenting insulin secretion in a physiological jnanner, while avoiding hypoglycemia associated with<br>
i<br>
sulfonylurea drugs.	<br>
Other important effects of GLp-1 on glucose homeostasis are suppression of glucagon secretion and inhibition of gastric motility. GLP-1 inhibitory actions on pancreatic alpha cell secretion of glucagon leads to decreases in hepatic glucose production via reduction in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This antiglucagon effect of GLP-1 is preserved in diabetic patients.<br><br>
The so-called ileal brake effect<br><br>
of GLP-1, in which gastric motility and gastric secretion<br><br>
are inhibited, is effected via vagal efferent receptors or by direct action on intestinal smooth muscle. Reduction of {gastric acid secretion by GLP-1 contributes to a lag phase in nutrient availability, thus obviating the need for rapid insulin response. In summary,<br><br>
the gastrointestinal effects of G,P-1 contribute significantly to delayed glucose and fatty<br>
acid absorption and modulate insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.<br>
GLP-1 has also been shown to induce beta cell specific genes, such as GLUT-1<br>
transporter, insulin (via the interaction of PDX-1 with insulin gene promoter), and<br>
hexokinase-1.    Thus GLP-1  i<br>
ould potentially reverse glucose intolerance normally<br>
associated with aging, as demonstrated by rodent experiments. In addition, GLP-1 may<br>
contribute to beta cell neogenes<br>
s and increase beta cell mass, in addition to restoring beta<br>
cell function during states of beta cell insufficiency.I Central effects of GLP-1 include increases in satiety coupled with decreases in food<br>
intake, effected via the action j of hypothalamic GLP-1 R.   A 48 hour continuous SC<br>
infusion of GLP-1 in type II<br>
diabetic subjects, decreased hunger and food intake and<br><br>
increased satiety. These anorec|tic effects were absent in GLP-1 R knock out mice.<br><br>
Exendins are another family c<br><br>
peptides implicated in insulin secretion.   Exendins are<br><br>
found in the saliva of the Gila-inonster, a lizard endogenous to Arizona, and the Mexican<br><br>
Beaded Lizard. Exendin-3 is p<br>
•esent in the saliva of Heloderma horridum, and exendin-4<br>
is present in the saliva of Heloderma suspectum (Eng, J., et al, J. Biol. Chem., 265:20259-62, 1990; Eng., J., I/ al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:7402-05 (1992)). The exendins<br><br>
have some sequence similarit <br>
y with the highest homology,<br>
to several members of the glucagon-like peptide family, 53 <br>
%, being to GLP-1  (Goke, <br>
 et <br>
 al., J. Biol.  Chem.,<br><br>
268:19650-55(1993)).<br>
Exendin-4 binds the GLP-1 receptors on insulin-secreting TCI cells, at dispersed acinar cells from guinea pig pancreas, and at parietal cells from stomach; the peptide also<br><br>
stimulates somatostatin release<br>
and inhibits gastrin release in isolated stomachs (Goke, et<br>
al, J. Biol. Chem., 268:1965055 (1993); Schepp, et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol, 69:183-91<br>
(1994); Eissele, et al, Life Sci.,<br>
55:629-34 (1994)). Exendin-3 and exendin-4 were found<br>
to bind the GLP-1 receptors on, to stimulating cAMP production in, and amylase release from, pancreatic acinar cells (Malhotra, R., et al, Relulatory Peptides, 41:149-56 (1992);Raufman, et al, J. Biol Chem.<br>
267:21432-37 (1992); Singh, et al, Regul Pept., 53:47-<br>
59 (1994)). The use of the injiulinotropic activities of exendin-3 and exendin-4 for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and the prevention of hyperglycemia has been proposed (Eng, U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286).<br>
Truncated exendin peptides sijch as exendin[9-39], a carboxyamidated molecule, and fragments 3-39 through 9-39 h* ve been reported to be potent and selective antagonists of GLP-1 (Goke, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 268:19650-55 (1993); Raufman, J. P., et al, J. Biol Chem., 266:2897-902 (1991); Schepp, W., et al, Eur. J. Pharm., 269:183-91 (1994); Montrose-Rafizadeh, et al., Diabetes, 45(Suppl. 2):152A (1996)). Exendin[9-39] blocks endogenous GLP-1 in vivo, resulting in reduced insulin secretion (Wang, et al, J. Clin. Invest., 95:417-21 (1995); D'Alessio, et al, J. Clin. Invest., 97:133-38 (1996)). The receptor apparently responsible for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 has been cloned<br>
from rat pancreatic islet cells<br>
(Thorens, B., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:8641-8645<br><br>
(1992)). Exendins and exendin[9-39] bind to the cloned GLP-1 receptor (rat pancreatic -<br><br>
cell GLP-1 receptor: Fehmann<br><br>
HC, et al., Peptides, 15 (3): 453-6 (1994); human GLP-1<br><br>
receptor: Thorens B, et al., Diabetes, 42 (11): 1678-82 (1993)). In cells transfected with the cloned GLP-1 receptor, 
GLP-1. Id.<br><br>
More particularly, exendin-4 is<br>
a 39 amino acid C-terminal amidated peptide found in the<br>
saliva of the Gila Monster (Heloderma horridum), with a 53% amino acid sequence homology to the GLP-1 peplide sequence. See, e.g., Eng, J., et al. "Isolation and Characterization of Exendin-4, and Exendin-3 Analogue from Heloderma suspectum<br><br>
Venom," J. Bio. Chem., 267:<br>
1, p. 7402-7405 (1992), Young, A. A., et al., "Glucose-<br>
Lowering and Insulin-Sensitizjing Actions of Exendin-4," Diabetes, Vol. 48, p. 1026-1034, May, 1999.  In terms ofjits activity, exendin-4 is a highly specific agonist for the<br><br>
GLP-1 receptor, and, like GLI<br><br>
'-1, is able to stimulate insulin secretion. Therefore, like<br><br>
GLP-1, exendin-4 is regarded as an insulinotropic peptide.<br>
However, unlike GLP-1, exendin-4 has a relatively long half-life in humans, because of its resistance to the dipeptidyl peptidase IV which rapidly degrades the GLP-1 sequence in vivo. Furthermore, it has b^en shown that, as compared to GLP-1, exendin-4 has a stronger capability to stimulate insulin secretion, and that a lower concentration of exendin-4 may be used to obtain such stimulating activity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No,<br>
5,424,286, herein incorporated<br>
by reference. Therefore exendin-4 peptides or derivatives<br>
thereof (for examples of suet derivatives, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,486, herein<br>
incorporated by reference, and have a greater potential utility<br>
its corresponding international application WO 01/04156) or the treatment of conditions involving the dysregulation<br>
of insulin levels (e.g., conditior s such as diabetes) than either insulin or GLP-1.<br>
I Another family of peptide hornkones implicated in metabolic diseases and disorders is the<br>
amylin family of peptide hormbnes, including amylin, calcitonin, calcitonin gene related peptide, adrenomedullin, and intermedin (also known as "AFP-6").   Amylin is a 37-<br>
amino acid protein hormone. It was isolated, purified and chemically characterized as the<br><br>
major component of amyloic<br>
deposits in the islets of pancreases of human Type 2<br><br><br><br>
diabetics (Cooper et al., Proc. molecule has two post-transla<br>
Natl. Acad Sci., USA, 84:8628-8632 (1987)). The amylin ional modifications: the C-terminus is amidated, and the<br><br>
cysteines in positions 2 and 7 ire cross-linked to form an N-terminal loop. The sequence of the open reading frame of the human amylin gene shows the presence of the Lys-Arg<br><br>
dibasic amino acid proteolytic<br><br>
cleavage signal, prior to the N-terrninal codon for Lys, and<br><br>
the Gly prior to the Lys-Argproteolytic signal at the CLAIMS-terminal position, a typical sequence for amidation by protein amidating enzyme, PAM (Cooper et al.,<br><br>
Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 1014:<br><br>
247-258(1989)).<br><br><br><br>
Amylin is believed to regulate gastric emptying, and suppress glucagon secretion and<br>
food intake, thus regulating <br>
 th to complement the actions of<br><br>
: rate of glucose appearance in the circulation.  It appears ns <br>
ulin, which regulates the rate of glucose disappearance<br><br>
from the circulation and its upake by peripheral tissues. These actions are supported by experimental findings in rodents and humans, which indicate that amylin complements the effects of insulin in pos prandial glucose control by at least three independent mechanisms, all of which affect the rate of glucose appearance. First, amylin suppresses postprandial glucagon secretion. Compared to healthy adults, patients with type 1 diabetes have no circulating amylin and patients with type 2 diabetes have diminished postprandial amylin concenaations. Furthermore, infusion of an amylin specific monoclonal antibody, which bound circulating amylin, again resulted in greatly elevated glucagon concentrations relative to controls. Both of these results point to a physiological role of endogenous amylin in the regulation of postprandial glucagon secretion. Second, amylin slows gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying. Finally,<br><br>
intrahypothalamic injections ol<br><br>
rat amylin were shown to reduce feeding in rats and alter<br><br>
neurotransmitter metabolism ii the hypothalamus.   In certain studies, food intake was<br><br>
significantly reduced for up tc<br>
eight hours following the intrahypothalamic injection of<br><br>
rat amylin and rat CORP.   In human trials, an amylin analog, pramlintide, has been<br><br>
shown to reduce weight or weight gain. Amylin may be beneficial in treating metabolic<br><br>
conditions such as diabetes and obesity.   Amylin may also be used to treat pain, bone<br>
disorders, gastritis, to modulate lipids, in particular triglycerides, or to affect body composition such as the preferential loss of fat and sparing of lean tissue.<br>
The hormone calcitonin (CT) was named for its secretion in response to induced hypercalcemia and its rapid hypocalcemic effect. It is produced in and secreted from neuroendocrine cells in the thyroid that have since been termed C cells. The best-studied<br><br>
action of CT(l-32) is its effect<br>
on the osteoclast. In vitro effects of CT include the rapid<br>
loss of ruffled borders and decreased release of lysosomal enzymes. Ultimately, the inhibition of osteoclast functions by CT results in a decrease in bone resorption.1 However, neither a chronic reduction of serum CT in the case of thyroidectomy nor the|<br><br>
increased serum CT found in<br><br>
medullary thyroid cancer appears to be associated with<br><br>
changes in serum calcium or tone mass. It is thus most likely that a major function of CT(l-32) is to combat acute Ijiypercalcemia in emergency situations and/or protect thei skeleton during periods of "calcium stress" such as growth, pregnancy, and lactation <br>
(Reviewed in Becker, JCEM,<br>
89(4): 1512-1525 (2004) and Sexton, Current Medicinal]<br>
Chemistry 6: 1067-1093 (1999)). Consistent with this is recent data from the calcitonin1 gene knockout mouse, which removes both the calcitonin and the CGRP-I peptides, that<br>
revealed that the mouse had increased calcemic response<br>
normal levels of basal calcium-related values, but an (Kurihara  H,  et al,  Hypertens Res.  2003  Feb;  26<br>
Suppl:S 105-8).<br>
CT has an effect on plasma calcium levels and inhibits osteoclast function and is widely<br>
used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Therapeutically, salmon CT (sCT) appears to;<br>
increase bone density and dectease fracture rates with minimal adverse effects. CT has<br>
also been successfully used over the past 25 years as a therapy for Paget's disease of<br>
bone, which is a chronic skeletal disorder that may result in enlarged or deformed bones<br>
in one or more regions of the skeleton. CT is also widely used for its analgesic effect onj<br>
bone pain experienced during osteoporosis, although the mechanism for this effect is not,<br>
clearly understood.	j<br>
I<br>
Calcitonin gene related peptidjs (CGRP) is a neuropeptide whose receptors are widely, distributed in the body, including the nervous system and the cardiovascular system.<br>
This peptide seems to modulate sensory neurotransmission and is one of the most potent endogenous vasodilatory peptide discovered to date. Reported biological effects for CGRP include: modulation of substance P in inflammation, nicotinic receptor activity at the neuromuscular junction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, a reduction of gastric acid secretion, peripheral vasodilation, cardiac acceleration, neuro-modulation, regulation of calcium metabol sm, osteogenic stimulation, insulin secretion, an increase in body temperature and a decrease in food intake. (Wimalawansa, Amylin, calcitonin<br>
gene-related peptide, calcitonii and ADM: a peptide superfamily. Crit Rev Neurobiol.<br>
I<br>
1997; 11(2-3): 167-239). An important role of CGRP is to control blood flow to various<br>
i<br>
organs by its potent vasodilatory actions, as evidenced by a decrease of mean arterial<br>
I<br>
pressure following intravenous! administration of a-CGRP. The vasodilatory actions are also supported by recent analysis of homozygous knockout CGRP mice, which demonstrated elevated peripheral vascular resistance and high blood pressure caused by increased peripheral sympathetic activity (Kurihara H, et ai, Targeted disruption of ADM and aCGRP genes reveajls their distinct biological roles. Hypertens Res. 2003 Feb; 26 Suppl:S 105-8). Thus, CGRJP appears to elicit vasodilatory effects, hypotensive effects and an increase in heart rate among other actions.<br>
vascular   disease    such   as hypertension, and pulmonary preterm labor is also potential 1)<br>
Prolonged infusion of CGRP Into patients with congestive cardiac failure has shown a sustained beneficial effect on hsmodynamic functions without adverse effects, suggesting a use in heart failure. Other : ndications of CGRP use include renal failure, acute and chronic coronary artery ischemia, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, other peripheral<br>
Raynaud's   phenomenon,   subarachnoid   hemorrhage, hypertension.   Preeclamptic toxemia of pregnancy and<br>
treatable. (Wimalawansa, 1997). Recent therapeutic uses<br>
include the use of CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine headaches.<br>
Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a<br>
most ubiquitously expressed with many more tissues<br>
containing the peptide than nDt.   A published review of ADM, (Hinson, J.P. et al,<br>
Endocrine Reviews (2000) 2<br>
(2): 138-167) details its effects on the cardiovascular<br>
system, cellular growth, the central nervous system and the endocrine system, with a range of biological actions including vasodilation, cell growth, regulation of hormone<br>
secretion, and natriuresis.   Studies in rat, cat, sheep, and man confirm that intravenous<br>
infusion of ADM results in pc|tent and sustained hypotension, and is comparable to that<br>
i<br>
of CGRP. However, the hypptensive effect of ADM on mean arterial pressure in the anesthetized rat is not inhibited by the CGRP antagonist CGRPs-37 suggesting that this<br>
j<br>
effect is not mediated via CGJIP receptors. Acute or chronic administration of human ADM in rats, anesthetized, conscious or hypertensive, results in a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance accompanied by a fall in blood pressure, with a concomitant rise in heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume.<br>
ADM has also been proposed as an important factor in embryogenesis and differentiation<br>
and as an apoptosis survival fsctor for rat endothelial cells. This is supported by recent<br>
mouse ADM knockout studies, in which mice homozygous for loss of the ADM gene<br>
demonstrated defective vascular formation during embryogenesis and thus died mid-<br>
gestation. It was reported th^t ADM +/- heterozygous mice had high blood pressure<br>
along with susceptibility to tissjue injury (Kurihara H, et a/., Hypertens Res. 2003 Feb; 26<br>

ADM affects such endocrine<br><br>
organs as the pituitary, the adrenal gland, reproductive<br><br>
organs and the pancreas. The jeptide appears to have a role in inhibiting ACTH release from the pituitary. In the adrenal gland, it appears to affect the secretory activity of the<br><br>
adrenal cortex in both rat and<br><br>
human and it increases adrenal blood flow, acting as a<br><br>
vasodilator in the adrenal vascular bed in intact rats. ADM has been shown to be present<br>
I<br>
throughout the female reproductive tract and plasma levels are elevated in normal pregnancy. Studies in a ratj model of preeclampsia show that ADM can reverse hypertension and decrease pup mortality when given to rats during late gestation. Because it did not have a similar effect in animals in early gestation or non-pregnant rats<br>
[<br>
in the preeclampsia model, this suggests that ADM may play an important regulatory role in the utero-placental cardiovascular system. In the pancreas, ADM most likely plays an inhibitory role since it attenuated and delayed insulin response to an oral glucose'<br>
challenge, resulting in initial j elevated glucose levels.    ADM can also affect renal<br>
function.    A bolus administered peripherally can significantly lower mean arterial<br>
pressure and raise renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and urine flow.  In some<br>
cases, there is also an increase in Na+ excretion.i ADM also has other peripheral effects on bone and on the lung. For bone, studies have<br>
supported a role beyond the cardiovascular system and fluid homeostasis and have demonstrated that ADM acts on fetal and adult rodent osteoblasts to increase cell growth comparable to those of knowi osteoblast growth factors such as transforming growth factor-p. This is important clinically as one of the major challenges in osteoporosis<br>
research is to develop a therapy that increases bone mass via osteoblastic stimulation. Ini the   lung,   ADM   not   only]   causes   pulmonary   vasodilation,   but   also   inhibitsby histamine or acetylcholine.     Recent studies using bronchoconstriction induced<br>
aerosolized ADM to treat pulmonary hypertension in a rat model indicate that inhalation<br><br>
treatment of this condition is<br><br>
effective, as evidenced by the fact that mean pulmonary<br><br>
arterial pressure and total pulmonary resistance were markedly lower in rats treated with ADM than in those given saline. This result was achieved without an alteration in systemic arterial pressure or heart rate (Nagaya N et al, Am J Physiol Heart Ore Physiol. 2003;285:H2125-31).|<br>
I<br>
In healthy volunteers, i.v. infvsion of ADM has been shown to reduce arterial pressure and to stimulate heart rate, cardiac output, plasma levels of cAMP, prolactin, norepinephrine and rennin. In these patients, there was little or no increase in urine volume or sodium excretion observed. In patients with heart failure or chronic renal<br><br>
failure, i.v. ADM had similar<br><br>
effects to those seen in normal subjects, and also induced<br><br>
diuresis and natriuresis, depending on the dose administered (Nicholls, MG et al.<br><br>
Peptides. 2001; 22:1745-1752]<br>
Experimental ADM treatment has also been shown to be<br>
beneficial in arterial and pulmonary hypertension, septic shock and ischemia/reperfusion injury (Beltowski J., Pol J Pharmacol. 2004;56:5-27).    Other indications for ADM<br>
treatment include: peripheral<br>
vascular disease, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension,<br>
preeclamptic toxemia of pregnimcy and preterm labor, and osteoporosis.<br>
Expression of AFP-6 (i.e., intjjrmedin) is primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract.   A specific receptor for AFP-6 has not been reported; however, binding studies<br>
indicate that AFP-6 binds to all the known receptors of the Amylin Family.  AFP-6 has been shown to increase cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing<br><br>
endogenous CGRP receptors<br>
and competes with labeled CGRP for binding to its<br>
receptors in these cells. In published in vivo studies, AFP-6 administration led to blood pressure reduction in both noimal and spontaneously hypertensive rats, most likely via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptors. In vivo administration in mice led to a suppression of gastric emptying and food intake. (Roh et al. J Biol Chem. 2004 Feb 20;279(8):7264-74.)<br>
It has been reported that the biological actions of amylin family peptide hormones are<br><br>
generally mediated via binding<br>
to two closely related type II G protein-coupled receptors<br><br>
(GPCRs), the calcitonin receptor (CTR) and the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR).<br><br>
Cloning and functional studies different combinations of CTR<br>
have shown that CGRP, ADM, and amylin interact with or the CRLR and the receptor activity modifying protein<br><br>
(RAMP).   Many cells express i multiple RAMPs.   It is believed that co-expression of RAMPs and either the CTR or CRLR is required to generate functional receptors for<br><br>
calcitonin, CGRP, ADM, and<br>
amylin.   The RAMP family comprises three members<br>
(RAMP1, -2, and -3), which sliare less then 30% sequence identity, but have a common topological organization. Co-ejxpression of CRLR and RAMP1 leads to the formation of a receptor for CGRP. Co-exp-ession of CRLR and RAMP2 leads to the formation of a receptor for ADM. Co-expression of CRLR and RAMP3 leads to the formation of a receptor for ADM and CORK Co-expression of hCTR2 and RAMP1 leads to the formation of a receptor for amylin and CGRP. Co-expression of hCTR2 and RAMP3 leads to the formation of a rece rtor for amylin.<br>
Yet another peptide hormone fiimily implicated in metabolic diseases and disorders is the leptin family. The mature fonn of circulating leptin is a 146-amino acid protein that is normally excluded from the CNS by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-CSF barrier. See, e.g., Weigle et al. 1995. J Clin Invest 96 : 2065-2070. Leptin is the afferent<br><br>
signal in a negative feedback<br>
regulating food intake and body weight.  The leptin<br>
receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor family.   Leptin's anorexigenic effect is dependent on binding to homotiimer of the Ob-Rb isoform of this receptor which encodes<br><br>
a  long  intra-cytoplasmic  dopiain that  includes  several  motifs  for  protein-prtein<br>
interaction.   Ob-Rb is highly region is an important site ofexpressed in the hypothalamus suggesting that this brain leptin action.   Mutation of the mouse ob gene has been<br>

and mapping to the db locus Several transcripts of the OE<br>
The leptin receptor (OB-R) gelne has been cloned (GenBank Accession No. AF098792)<br>
(see, e.g., Tartaglia, et al., 1995. Cell 83: 1263-1271). -R, resulting from alternative splicing, have also been<br>
identified. Defects in OB-R produce a syndrome in the mutant diabetic ob/ob mouse that is phenotypically identical to the ob/ob mouse (see, e.g., Ghilardi, et a/., 1996. Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 93: 6231-623f<br>
).  In contrast to ob/ob mice, however, administration of<br>
recombinant leptin to C57BLKS/J-m ob/ob mice does not result in reduced food intake and body weight (see, e.g., Roberts and Greengerg, 1996. Nutrition Rev. 54: 41-49).<br>
Most leptin-related studies able to report weight loss activity from administration of recombinant leptin, leptin fragments and/or leptin receptor variant have administered said constructs directly into the ventricles of the brain. See e.g., Weigle, et al, 1995. J Clin Invested : 2065-2070; Barash,^0/., 1996. Endocrinology 137: 3144-3147.<br>
Other studies have shown sigiificant weight loss activity due to administered of leptin peptides through intraperitoneally (i.p.) administration to test subjects. See, Grasso et al., 1997. Endocrinology 138: 141 • -1418. Further, leptin fragments, and most particularly an 18 amino acid fragment composing residues taken from full length human leptin, have<br>
been reported to function in w sight loss, but only upon direct administration through an implanted cannula to the lateral brain ventricle of rats.     See,  e.g., PCT Paten Applications WO 97/46585, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
Another   peptide   hormone cholecystokinin (CCK).   CCK<br><br>
implicated   in   metabolic   diseases   and   disorders   is was reportedly identified in 1928 from preparations of<br><br>
intestinal extracts by its abiliy to stimulate gallbladder contraction. Other biological actions of CCK have since been reported, including stimulation of pancreatic secretion, delayed gastric emptying, stimulation of intestinal motility and stimulation of insulin secretion. See Lieverse et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 713: 268-272 (1994). The actions of<br><br>
CCK, also reportedly include<br><br>
effects on cardiovascular function, respiratory function,<br><br>
neurotoxicity and seizures, cancer cell proliferation, analgesia, sleep, sexual and reproductive behaviors, memory, anxiety and dopamine-mediated behaviors. Crawley and Corwin, Peptides 15: 73J1-755 (1994). Other reported effects of CCK include stimulation of pancreatic groAJvth, stimulation of gallbladder contraction, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pancreatic polypeptide release and a contractile component of peristalsis. Additional repotted effects of CCK include vasodilation. Walsh,<br><br>

Smith and Gibbs, Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 713:236-241 (1994). It has also been suggested that estradiol and CCK can haVe a synergistic effect on satiety. Dulawa et al, Peptides 15:913-918 (1994); Smith amjl Gibbs, supra. It has also been proposed that signals arising from the small intejstine in response to nutrients therein may interact synergistically with CCK to reduce food intake. Cox, Behav. Brain Res. 38:35-44 (1990). Additionally, it has been reported that CCK induces satiety in several species. For example, it has been reported that feeding depression was caused by CCK injected<br>
intraperitoneally in rats, intrairterially in pigs, intravenously in cats and pigs, into the<br><br>
cerebral ventricles in monkeys<br><br>
rats, dogs and sheep, and intravenously in obese and non-<br><br>
obese humans. See Lieversr et al, supra. Studies from several laboratories have reportedly confirmed the behavioral specificity of low doses of CCK on inhibition in feeding, by comparing responc ing for food to responding for nonfood reinforcers in both monkeys and rats and by stun ring that CCK elicits the sequence of behaviors normally<br><br>
observed after meal ingestior<br><br>
(i.e., the postprandial satiety sequence).   Additionally,<br><br>
comparison of behavior after CCK to behavior after food ingestion, alone or in combination with CCK has rejwrtedly revealed behavioral similarities between CCK am<br><br>
food ingestion.   Crawley and<br><br>

CCK was characterized in 1966 as a 33-amino acid peptide. Crawley and Corwin, supra Species-specific molecular vmants of the amino acid sequence of CCK have been identified. The 33-amino acid sequence and a truncated peptide, its 8-amino acid C<br><br>

hormones implicated in metabolic diseases and disorders is amily  ("PPF").     Pancreatic  polypeptide  ("PP")  was insulin extracts and was named by its organ of origin (Kimmel et al, Endocrinology 83: 1323-30 (1968)). ;ontaining distinctive structural motifs. A related peptide extracts of intestine and named Peptide YY ("PYY") tyrosines (Tatemoto, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 79: peptide was later found in extracts of brain and named<br>

These three related peptides have been reported to exert various biological effects. Effects of PP include inhibition of pancreatic secretion and relaxation of the gallbladder. Centrally administered PP procuces modest increases in feeding that may be mediated by receptors localized to the hypothalamus and brainstem (reviewed in Gehlert, Proc. Soc.<br>

i<br>
Release of PYY occurs following a meal. An alternate molecular form of PYY is PYY(3-36) (Eberlein et al., Peptides 10: 797-803 (1989); Grandt et al., Regul. Pept. 51: 151-9 (1994)). This fragment constitutes approximately 40% of total PYY-like immunoreactivity in human an! canine intestinal extracts and about 36% of total plasma PYY immunoreactivity in a fasting state to slightly over 50% following a meal. It is apparently a dipeptidyl peptidiise-IV (DPP4) cleavage product of PYY. PYY(3-36) is reportedly a selective ligand at (the Y2 and Y5 receptors, which appear pharmacologically unique in preferring N-terminally truncated (i.e., C-terminal fragments of) NPY analogs.<br>
Peripheral administration of<br>
YY reportedly reduces gastric acid secretion, gastric<br>
motility, exocrine pancreatic secretion (Yoshinaga et al., Am. J. Physiol. 263: G695-701 (1992); Guan et al, Endocrinology 128: 911-6 (1991); Pappas et al, Gastroenterology<br>

For example, centrally administered PYY had some<br>
effects opposite to those described herein for peripherally injected PYY(3-36) in that gastric acid secretion was stirm dated, not inhibited. Gastric motility was suppressed only in conjunction with TRH stimulation, but not when administered alone, and was indeed stimulatory at higher doses through presumed interaction with PP receptors. PYY has<br>
been shown to stimulate food and water intake after central administration (Morley et al., Brain Res. 341: 200-3 (1985); <porp et al. j. physiol. r317-23></porp>
Metabolic diseases and diso<br>
ders take on may forms, including obesity, diabetes,<br>
dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, cellular apoptosis, etc. Obesity and its associated disorders are common and very serious public health problems in the United States and throughout the world. Upper 1x&gt;dy obesity is the strongest risk factor known for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for hypertension, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, stroke gallbladder disease, osteoarthrijtis, sleep apnea, reproductive disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, cancers of pe breast, prostate, and colon, and increased incidence of<br>
i<br>
complications of general anesthesia (see, e.g., Kopelman, Nature 404: 635-43 (2000)). It<br>
reduces life-span and carries a serious risk of co-morbidities above, as well disorders such as infections, varicose veins, acanthosis nigricans, eczema, exercise intolerance, insulin resistance, hypertensioh hypercholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, orthopedic injury, and thromboembolic disease (FLissanen et al., Br. Med. J. 301: 835-7 (1990)). Obesity is also a risk factor for the group of conditions called insulin resistance syndrome, or "Syndrome X." Recent estimate for the medical cost of obesity and associated disorders is $150 billion worldwide. The pathogenesis of obesity is believed to be multifactorial but the basic problem is that in obese subjects nutrient availability and energy expenditure do not come into balance until there is excess adipose tissue. Obesity is currently a poorly treatable, chronic, essentially intractable metabolic disorder. A therapeutic drug useful in wejight reduction of obese persons could have a profound beneficial effect on their health<br>
Diabetes is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism characterized by hyperglycemia and glucosuria resulting from insufficient production or utilization of insulin. Diabetes severely affects the quality of life of large parts of the populations in developed countries. Insufficient production of insulin is characterized as type 1 diabetes and insufficient utilization of insulin is type 2 diabetes. However, it is now widely recognized that there are many distinct diabetes related diseases which have their onset long before patients are diagnosed as having overt diabetes. Also, the effects from the suboptimal control of<br>
glucose metabolism in diabees gives rise to a wide spectrum of related lipid and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
Dyslipidemia, or abnormal levels of lipoproteins in blood plasma, is a frequent occurrence among diabetics. Dyslipidemia is typically characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, low HDL (High ] Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol, normal to elevated levels of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol and increased levels of small dense, LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) piirticles in the blood. Dyslipidemia is one of the main<br><br>
contributors to the increased<br>
ncidence of coronary events and deaths among diabetic<br>
subjects. Epidemiologicai studies have confirmed this by showing a several-fold increase in coronary deaths among dial&gt;etic subjects when compared with non-diabetic subjects<br>
j<br>
Several lipoprotein abnormalities have been described among diabetic subjects.<br>
Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biologically action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect and a state of impaired glucose tolerance develops. Failing to compensate for the defective insulin action, the plasma glucose Concentration inevitable rises resulting in the clinical state of diabetes. It is being<br>
recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypei tension and angina has been described as a syndrome, Syndrome X, having insulin resistance as the common pathogenic link.<br>
during normal development.  It is well documented that regulation of pancreatic endocrine beta cells.   There is<br>
Apoptosis is an active process i of cellular self-destruction that is regulated by extrinsic<br>
and intrinsic signals occurring<br>
apoptosis plays a key role in<br>
increasing evidence that in aiult mammals the beta-cell mass is subject to dynamic<br>
changes to adapt insulin production for maintaining euglycemia in particular conditions,<br>
such as pregnancy and obesity.The control of beta cell mass depends on a subtle balance<br>
between cell proliferation, growthand programmed cell death (apoptosis). A disturbance<br>
of this balance may lead to<br>
mpairment of glucose homeostasis.   For example, it is<br>
noteworthy that glucose intolerance develops with aging when beta cell replication rates<br>
are reduced and human autop cell mass in patients with<br>
studies repeatedly showed a 40-60% reduction of beta non-insulin-dependent-diabetes mellitus compared  with<br><br>
nondiabetic subjects. It is generally agreed that insulin resistance is an invariable accompaniment of obesity but that normoglycemia is maintained by compensatory hyperinsulinemia until the beti cells become unable to meet the increased demand forinsulin, at which point type 2 diabetes begins. Attempts to treatment of the multiple abnormalities associated with diabetes have<br>
prompted for the administration of several anti-diabetic medicaments in order to address these abnormalities in the different patients. Examples of anti-diabetic medicaments are proteins such as insulin and insulin analogues, and small molecules such as insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues and appetite regulating compounds.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates generally to novel, selectable hybrid polypeptides useful a agents for the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases and disorders which can be<br><br>
alleviated by control plasma g<br><br>
ucose levels, insulin levels, and/or insulin secretion, such<br><br>
as diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. Such conditions and disorders include, bu are not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes.<br>
metabolically, and/or pharmaci based on "bio-activities", e.g.,<br>
In one aspect,  the  invention involves  the  modular assembly of physiologically<br>
kinetically active peptidic modules that may be selectable therapeutic efficacy, scope of function, duration of action<br>

Without intending to be limited by theory, the present invention relates at least in part to<br><br>
a "toolbox" approach, wherein<br><br>
bio-active peptide hormone modules are linked in binary<br><br><br><br>
tertiary or higher order combinations to create novel, efficacious therapeutic agents with<br>
selectable properties.    The ' hormones, peptide fragments<br><br>
bio-active peptide hormone modules" may be peptide with hormonal activity, or structural motifs of peptide<br><br>
hormones that impart chemical, metabolic, and/or other pharmacokinetic stability. The peptide hormones can include native peptide hormones, as well as peptide hormone analogs and derivatives, as kncwn in the art and described herein.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, it has been found that the combination of certain physicochemical characteristics of two or more peptide hormones into a single modality can facilitate intervention at several points in a dysfunctional metabolic circuit. As such,<br><br>
in one aspect of the invention,<br>
rationally-designed hybrid polypeptides are provided that<br><br>
integrate selectable bio-activities into a single polypeptide agent. In one embodiment, the<br>
selectable hybrid p <br>

limited by theory, design of the hybrid polypeptides of th<br><br>
present invention may generally involve: (1) the identification, selection and pairing o bio-active peptide hormone modules for desired efficacy and therapeutic use, and (2) th covalent linking of the bio-jctive modules (e.g. native peptide hormones, peptid hormone analogs or derivatives with hormonal activity, peptide hormone fragments with<br><br>
hormonal activity, stabilizing<br>
notifs, etc.) either directly or via a linker without loss o<br>
bio-activity of the componert modules. In certain embodiments, module selection criteria may include, but not be limited to: (a) desired in vivo efficacy for desired therapeutic or prophylactic indication; (b) optional synergism or dual action of the linkec modules for multiple therapeutic or prophylactic indications; and/or (c) a desirec chemical stability, conformational stability, metabolic stability, receptor interaction protease inhibition, and/or other pharmacokinetic characteristic.<br><br>
