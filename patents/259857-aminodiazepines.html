AMTNODIAZEPTNES AS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of United States provisional patent application number 60/709,667, filed August 19, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to methods and compositions for modulating immune function. More specifically, this invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating TLR8-mediated signaling.<br>
Description of the state of the art<br>
Stimulation of the immune system, which includes stimulation of either or both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, is a complex phenomenon that can result in either protective or adverse physiologic outcomes for the host. In recent years there has been increased interest in the mechanisms underlying innate immunity, which is believed to initiate and support adaptive immunity. This interest has been fueled in part by the recent discovery of a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor proteins known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Compositions and methods useful for modulating innate immunity are therefore of great interest, as they may affect therapeutic approaches to conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft versus host disease (GvHD), infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency.<br>
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type I transmembrane proteins that allow organisms (including mammals) to detect microbes and initiate an innate immune response (Beutler, B., Nature 2004, 430:257-263). They contain homologous cytoplasmic domains and leucine-rich extracelluar domains and typically form homodimers that sense extracellular (or internalized) signals and subsequently initiate a signal transduction cascade via adaptor molecules such as MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88). There is such high homology in the cytoplasmic domains of the TLRs that, initially, it was suggested that similar signaling pathways exist for all TLRs (Re, F., Strominger, J. L., Immunobiology 2004, 209:191-198). Indeed, all TLRs can activate NF-kB and MAP kinases; however, the cytokine/chemolcine release profiles derived from TLR activation appears unique to each TLR. Additionally, the signaling pathway that TLRs stimulate is very similar to the pathway induced by the cytokine receptor<br><br>
IL-1R. This may be due to the homology that these receptors share, i.e., TIR (Toll/IL-IR homology) domains. Once the TIR. domain is activated in TLRs and MyD88 is recruited, activation of the IRAK family of serine/tlireonine kinases results which eventually promotes the degradation of Ik-B and activation of NF-kB (Means T. K., et al., Life Sci. 2000, 68:241-258). While it appears that this cascade is designed to allow extracellular stimuli to promote intracellular events, there is evidence that some TLRs migrate to endosomes where signaling can also be initiated. This process may allow for intimate contact with engulfed microbes and fits with the role that these receptors play in the innate immune response (Underbill, D. M., et al., Nature 1999, 401:811-815). This process might also allow host nucleic acids, released by damaged tissues (for example, in inflammatory disease) or apoptosis to trigger a response via endosomal presentation. Among mammals, there are 11 TLRs that coordinate this rapid response. A hypothesis put forward years ago (Janeway, C. A., Jr. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989, 54:1-13) that the innate immune response initiates the adaptive immune response through the pattern of. TLR activation caused by microbes has now been substantiated. Thus, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented by a diverse group of infectious organisms results in a innate immune response involving certain cytokines, chemoldnes and growth factors followed by a precise adaptive immune response tailored to the infectious pathogen via antigen presentation resulting in antibody production and cytotoxic T cell generation.<br>
Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has long been appreciated as an adjuvant and immune-stimulant and as a pharmacological tool for inducing an inflammatory reaction in mammals similar to septic shock. Using a genetic approach, TLR4 was identified as the receptor for LPS. The discovery that LPS is an agonist of TLR4 illustrates the usefulness of TLR modulation for vaccine and human disease therapy (Aderem, A.; Ulevitch, R. J., Nature 2000, 406:782-787). It is now appreciated that various TLR agonists can activate B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, endothelial cells and several types of epithelia in addition to regulating proliferation and apoptosis of certain cell types.<br>
To date, TLR7 and TLRS, which are somewhat similar, have been characterized as ' receptors for single-stranded RNA found in endosomal compartments and thus thought to be important for the immune response to viral challenge. Imiquimod, an approved topical anti¬viral/anti-cancer drug, has recently been described as a TLR7 agonist that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in certain skin disorders (Miller, R. L., et al., Int. J. Immunopharm. 1999, 21:1-14).   This small molecule drug has been described as a structural mimetic of ssRNA.<br><br>
TLR8 was first described in 2000 (Du, X., et al., European Cytokine Network 2000 (Sept.), 11(3):362-371) and was rapidly ascribed to being involved with the innate immune response to viral infection (Miettinen, M., et al, Genes and Immunity 2001 (Oct.), 2(6):349-355).<br>
Recently it was reported that certain imidazoquinoline compounds having antiviral activity are ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 (Hemmi H., et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:196-200; Jurlc M., et al., (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:499). Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators of immune cells with antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype and MyD88-deficient mice, Hemmi et al. recently reported that two imidazoquinolines, imiquimod and resiquimod (R848), induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleulcin-12 (IL-12) and activate NF-KB only in wildtype cells, consistent with activation through a TLR (Hemmi, H., et al, (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:196-200). Macrophages from mice deficient in TLR7 but not other TLRs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these imidazoquinolines. In addition, the imidazoquinolines induced dose-dependent proliferation of splenic B cells and the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype but not TLR7-/- mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7, but not TLR2 or TLR4, in human embryonic kidney cells results in NF-KB activation in response to resiquimod. The findings of Hemmi et al. thus suggest that these imidazoquinoline compounds are non-natural ligands of TLR7 that can induce signaling through TLR7. Recently it was reported that R848 is also a ligand for human TLR8 (Jurlc, M., et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:499).<br>

The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers, diastereomers mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures, pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of Formulas I and II. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomer mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column. Methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition, J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992).<br>
In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention.. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.<br>
A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of<br><br>
ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Drug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology, Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).<br>
Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as bracine, quinine, ephedrine, slrychnine, a-methyl-fi-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.<br>
Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E.  and Wilen,  S. "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", John Wiley &amp;  Sons, Inc.,  1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric   compounds   can be  formed  by  reacting   asymmetric  compounds  with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer.  A method of detenriining optical purity involves making chiral esters, for example a menthyl ester such as (-)menthyl chloroformate, in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III, (1982) J. Org. Chem. 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR; spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. \ Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96/15111). \ By method (3), a   racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (Chiral Liquid Chromatography (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and  Hall New York; Okamoto, (1990); J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378).   Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, su'ch as optical rotation and circular dichroism.<br><br>

Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (C1-C10)alkyl, (C3-C7)cycloallcyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural a-aminoacyl-natural a-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H, (C1-C6)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY0)Y! wherein Y0 is (C1-C4) allcyl and Y1 is (C1-C6)alkyl, carbox3r(C1-C6)allcyl, amino(C1-C4)alkyl or mono-N- or di-N,N-(C1-C6)allcylaminoalkyl, -C(Y2)Y3 wherein Y2 is H or methyl and Y3 is mono-N- or di-N,N-(Ci-C6)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl.<br>

Alternatively, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency generally will employ a compound of Formula I or II that augment TLR8-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR8 ligand. In some instances the compositions can be used to inhibit or promote TLR8-mediated signaling in response to a TLR8 ligand or a TLR8 signaling agonist. In other instances the compositions can. be used to inhibit or promote TLR8-mediated immunostimulation in a subject.<br>
The term "treating," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means at least the mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, and includes, but is not limited to, modulating and/or inhibiting the disease condition, and/or alleviating the disease condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition.

The immunodeficiency can be acquired or it can be congenital.<br><br>
As used herein, "graft rejection" refers to immunologically mediated hyperacute, acute, or chronic injury to a tissue or organ derived from a source other than the host. The term thus encompasses both cellular; and antibody-mediated rejection, as well as rejection of both allografts and xenografts.<br>

In order to use a compound of Formula I or II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic<br>
	_„_			&gt;<br>
treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a compound of Formula I or II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or II or a metabolite, tautomer, solvate, or pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof (alone or together with an additional therapeutic agent as disclosed herein) is intimately admixed, for example, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques to produce a dose. A carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral. Examples of suitable carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media, adjuvants, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, sweeteners, stabilizers (to promote long term storage), emulsifiers, binding agents, thickening agents, salts, preservatives, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, flavoring agents, and miscellaneous materials such as buffers and absorbents that may be needed in order to prepare a particular therapeutic composition. The use of such media and agents with pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with a compound of Formula I or II, its use in the therapeutic compositions and preparations is contemplated.    Supplementary active<br><br>
ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions and preparations as described herein.<br>
/ The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing). For example, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more coloring, sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.<br>
Suitable pharrnaceutically-acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters ■ derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene, oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and<br><br>
hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, anti¬oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), coloring agents, flavoring agents, and/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-<br>
water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, or a<br>
mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, esters or partial<br>
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring and preservative<br>
agents.	;	<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent, preservative, flavoring and/or coloring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. For parenteral formulations, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, aqueous sodium chloride solution, 1,3-butanediol, or any other suitable non¬toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent. Other ingredients including those that aid<br><br>
dispersion may be included. Of course, where sterile water is to be used and maintained as<br>
sterile, the compositions and carriers must also be sterilized. Injectable suspensions may also<br>
be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be<br>
employed.	,<br>
Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient with a conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for administration by insufflation may be in the form of a finely divided powder containing particles of average diameter of, for example, 30 urn or much less, the powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is then conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50 mg of active ingredient for use with a turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known agent sodium cromoglycate.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional pressurized aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>
Compositions for transdermal administration may be in the form of those transdermal skin patches that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many, types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters. polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S.<br><br>
