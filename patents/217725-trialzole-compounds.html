				<td>A valve for an aerosol comprises a valve body (1) and a surrounding rubber sleeve (2). The body defines an inlet and outlet passages (3, 4) and bores (5, 6) connecting these passages to the surface of the valve. When the pressure of fluid in the inlet passage (3) and bore (5) builds to a sufficient value the sleeve is pushed away from the body permitting flow through the bores between the passages. When the pressure falls the sleeve closes the bores to interrupt the flow.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to triazole compounds and to the use of such compounds. The compounds mentioned have valuable therapeutic properties and can be used for treating diseases which respond to dopamine D3 receptor ligands.<br>
Compounds of this type having physiological activity have been disclosed. US-A 4,338,453; 4,408,049 and 4,577,020 describe triazole compounds which have antiallergic or antipsychotic activity. DE-A 44 25 144 and WO 97/25324 describe triazole compounds which respond to dopamine D3 receptor ligands. Compounds of the same structural type, however with other heterocycles in place of the triazole ring are disclosed in DE-A-44 25 146, DE-A-44 25 143 and DE 44 25 145.<br>
Neurons obtain their information by way of G protein-coupled receptors, inter alia. A large number of substances exert their effect by way of these receptors. One of these substances is dopamine.<br>
It is known with certainty that dopamine is present and that it has a physiological function as a neurotransmitter. Cells responding to dopamine are connected with the etiology of schizophrenia and Parkinson"s disease. These and other diseases are treated with drugs which interact with the dopamine receptors.<br>
Prior to 1990, two dopamine receptor subtypes were clearly defined pharmacologically, ie. the Di and D2 receptors.<br>
More recently, a third subtype has been found, ie. the D3 receptor, which appears to mediate some of the effects of the antipsychotic drugs. (J.C. Schwartz et al., The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Target for Antipsychotics, in Novel Antipsychotic Drugs, H.Y. Meltzer, Ed. Raven Press, New York 1992, pages 135-144)<br>
D3 receptors are principally expressed in the limbic system. It is therefore assumed that a selective D3 antagonist would probably have the antipsychotic properties of the D2 antagonists but would not have their neurological side effects. (P. Solokoff et al., Localization and Function of the D3 Dopamine Receptor, Arzneim. Forsch./Drug Res. 42(1K 224 (1992); P. Solokoff et al. Molecular<br><br>
Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Dopamine Receptor (D3) as a Target for Neuroleptics, Nature,  Ml,   146 (1990)).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain triazole compounds exhibit a high affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor and a low affinity for the D2 receptor. These compounds are therefore selective D3 ligands.<br>
The present invention relates, therefore, to compounds of the formula I: <br>
where<br>
Ar1 is phenyl, naphthyl or a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic<br>
aromatic ring having from 1, 2, 3 or heteroatoms which are independently selected from 0, S and N, where Ar1 may have 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents which are selected, independently of each other, from Ci-Cg-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH, OCj-Cg-alkyl, halogen or phenyl, Ci-C6-alkoxy, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, halogen, CN, COOR2, NR2R2, NO2, SO2R2, SC&gt;2NR2R2, or phenyl, which may be substituted by Ci-C6-alkyl, OCi-C6-alkyl, NR2R2, CN, CF3, CHF2, or halogen, and where the heterocyclic, aromatic ring mentioned may be fused to a phenyl ring;<br>
A  is straight-chain or branched C4-Ci0-alkylene or<br>
straight-chain or branched C3-Ci0-alkylene which comprises at least one group Z"which is selected from 0, S, NR2, CONR2, COO, CO, or a double or triple bond,<br>
B   is a radical of the formula:<br><br>
or, if Ar1 represents the 5- or 6-membered, heterocyclic or aromatic ring which may be substituted as indicated, B may also be a radical of the formulae<br><br><br>
Ar2 is phenyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl or triazinyl, where Ar2 may have from 1 to 4 substituents which are selected, independently of each other, from OR2, C2-C6-alkenyl, Ci-C6 alkyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, Ci-C6-alkoxy-Ci-C6-alkyl, halogen-Ci-C6-alkyl, halogen-Ci-C6-alkoxy, halogen, CN, NO2, S02R2, NR2R2, S02NR2R2, a 5- or 6-membered carbocyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic ring and a 5- or 6-membered, heterocyclic aromatic or non-aromatic ring having from 1 or 2 heteroatoms which are selected from 0, S and N, where the carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring may be substituted by Ci-C6-alkyl, phenyl, phenoxy, halogen, 0Cx-C6-alkyl, OH, N02 or CF3 and where Ar2 may be fused to a carbocyclic or . heterocyclic ring of the above-defined nature,<br>
R1  is H, C3-C6-cycloalkyl or Ci-C6-alkyl which may be substituted by OH, 0Ci-C6-alkyl or phenyl;<br>
the radicals R2, which can be identical or different, are H or Ci-Ce-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH, OCi-C6-alkyl or phenyl;<br>
and their salts with physiologically tolerated acids.<br>
The novel compounds are selective dopamine D3 receptor ligands which act in a regioselective manner in a limbic system and which, due to their low affinity for the D2 receptor, have fewer side effects than the classic neuroleptics, which are D2 receptor antagonists. The compounds can therefore be used for treating diseases which respond to dopamine D3 receptor antagonists or dopamine D3 receptor agonists, eg. for treating diseases of the central nervous system, in particular schizophrenia, depressions, neuroses, psychoses, parkinson and anxiety.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the following expressions have the meanings given in conjunction with them:<br><br>
Alkyl (also in radicals such as alkoxy, alkylamino, etc.) is a straight-chain or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and, in particular, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The alkyl group can have one or more substituents which are selected, independently of each other, from OH, 0Ci-C6-alkyl, halogen or phenyl.<br>
Examples of an alkyl group are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, t-butyl, etc.<br>
Cycloalkyl is, in particular, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
Alkylene radicals are straight-chain or branched. If A does not have any group Z, A then comprises from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. The chain between the triazole nucleus and group B then has at least 4 carbon atoms. If A has at least one of said Z groups, A then comprises from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
If the alkylene groups comprise at least one of the Z groups, these may either be arranged in the alkylene chain at an arbitrary site or in position 1 or 2 of group A (seen from the Ar1 radical). The radicals CONR2 and COO are preferably arranged such that the carbonyl group is facing the triazole ring. Particularly preferred are compounds of the formula I in which A is -Z-C3-C6-alkylene, in particular -Z-CH2CH2CH2-, -Z-CH2CH2CH2CH2-, -Z-CH2CH=CHCH2-, -Z-CH2C(CH3)=CHCH2-, -Z-CH2C(=CH2)CH2-, -Z-CH2CH(CH3)CH2- or a linear -Z-C7-Ci0-alkylene radical, with Z being attached to the triazole ring.

R3 to R6 are H or the abovementioned substituents of the radical<br>
Ar1,<br>
R7 is H, Ci-C6-alkyl or phenyl, and<br>
X is N or CH. If the phenyl radical is substituted, the substituents are preferably in the m position or the p position.<br><br><br>

The radicals R3 to R6 are preferably H, Ci-C6-alkyl, OR2, CN, phenyl which may be substituted by Ci-C6-alkyl, Ci-C6-alkoxy or halogen, CF3 and halogen and, in particular, H, Ci-C6-alkyl, OR2 and halogen. In this context, R2 has the abovementioned meanings.<br>
The radical B is preferably<br><br>
The radical Ar2 may have one, two, three or four substituents, preferably one or two substituents, which are located, in particular, in the m position and/or the p position. They are preferably selected, independently of each other, from Ci-C6-alkyl, haloalkyl, NO2, halogen, in particular chlorine, phenyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.

When one of the substituents of the Ar2 radical is a carbocyclic radical, this latter radical is then, in particular, a phenyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl radical.<br><br>
When Ar2 is fused to a carbocyclic radical, this latter radical is, in particular, a naphthalene or dihydro- or tetrahydro-naphthalene radical.<br>
According to an embodiment the invention relates to compounds of formula I, wherein Ar1 is a heterocyclic aromatic ring as defined above, B is<br><br>

unsaturated radicals B, using methods which are known from the literature.<br>
Compounds of type B are either known or are obtained in a similar way to know methods as e.g. 1,4-diazacycloalkanes: L. Borjeson et al., Acta Chem. Scand. 1991, 45, 621; Majahrzahl et al. Acta. Pol. Pharm., 1975, 32, 145; 1-azacycloheptanones: A. Yokoo et al., Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956, 29, 631 and WO 97/25324.<br>
In the above formulae, Ar1, R1, A, B, Z and Ar2 are as defined above.<br>
Compounds of the Ar1-triazole, Ar2" Ar1 type are either known or can be prepared using known methods, as described, for example, in S. Kubota et al. Chem.  Pharm.  Bull   1975, 23,   955 or A.R. Katritzky, C.W. Rees(ed.) "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry", Pergamon Press, or "The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds"" J. Wiley&amp;Sons Inc. NY and the literature cited in that document.<br>
The compounds of the formula VIII are novel and are likewise part of the subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of the (VIII) and (XI) type, where A is C0-alkylene, can be prepared by metallating the 3-aryl-5-H-l,2,4(4H)-triazoles<br><br>
and by a method similar to methods described in T. Kauffman et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1972, 11,   846 or by A.R. Katritzky, C.W. Rees(ed.) "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry", Pergamon Press Vol. 5, p 753.<br>
The novel compounds and the starting materials and intermediates can also be prepared by a method similar to the methods described in the patent publications which were cited initially.<br>
The above-described reactions generally take place in a solvent at between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the solvent employed. Examples of solvents which can be used are esters, such as ethyl acetate, ethers, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br><br>
dimethoxyethane, toluene, xylene, ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol.<br>
If desired, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of an acid binder. Suitable acid binders are inorganic bases, such as sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium ethoxide or sodium hydride, or organometallic compounds, such butyllithium, or alkylmagnesium compounds, or organic bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The latter can simultaneously serve as solvents.<br>
The reactions may be carried out using a catalyst, such as transition metals and their complexes, eg. Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2 or Pd(P(oTol)3)4, or using a phase transfer catalyst, eg. tetrabutylammonium chloride or tetrapropylammonium bromide.<br>
The crude product is isolated in a customary manner, for example by filtering, by distilling off the solvent or by extracting from the reaction mixture, etc. The resulting compounds can be purified in a customary manner, for example by recrystallization from a solvent, by chromatography or by conversion into an acid addition compound.<br>
The acid addition salts are prepared, in a customary manner, by mixing the free base with the appropriate acid, where appropriate in solution in an organic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an ether, such as methyl t-butyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
When used for treating the abovementioned diseases, the novel compounds are administered orally or parenterally (subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, or intraperitoneally) in a customary manner. They can also be administered through the nose/throat region using vapors or sprays.<br>
The dose depends on the age, condition and weight of the patient and on the mode of administration. As a rule, the daily dose of active compound is from about 10 to 1000 mg per patient and day in the case of oral administration and from about 1 to 500 mg per patient and day in the case of parenteral administration.<br><br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which comprise the novel compounds. These pharmaceuticals are present, in the customary pharmacological administration forms, in solid or liquid form, for example as tablets, film tablets, capsules, powders, granules, coated tablets, suppositories, solutions or sprays. In this context, the active compounds can be worked up together with the customary pharmacological auxiliary substances, such as tablet binders, fillers, preservatives, tablet disintegrants, flowance agents, emollients, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solubilizers, retarding agents, antioxidants and/or propellant gases (cf. H. Sucker et al., Pharmazeutische Technologie [Pharmaceutical Technology], Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978). The resulting administration forms normally comprise the active compound in a quantity of from 1 to 99 % by weight.<br>
The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
3-{3-[4-(2-t-Butyl-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidin-4-yl-)piperazin-l-yl]propylmercapto}-4-methyl-5-phenyl-l,2,4-(4H)-triazole<br>
A.  Preparation of the starting compounds:<br>
A.1 2-t-Butyl-4-[4-(3-chloropropyl)piperazin-1-yl]-6-tri-fluoromethylpyrimidine and 2,2-dimethylpropanimidamide were reacted, in a known manner, with ethyl trifluoroacetate to give 2-(2,2-<br>
dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidine. Heterocyclic Compounds (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1994, Vol. 52, D.J. Brown (Ed.)).<br>
C9H11F3N2O m.p. 187-188° C.<br>
A.2 After chlorinating with thionyl chloride, the crude product was treated with an excess of anhydrous piperazine, with 2-t-butyl-4-piperazin-l-yl-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidine being obtained.<br>
C13H19F3N4 m p.   78-80° C.<br><br>
A. 3 Alkylating the resulting compound with<br>
l-bromo-3-chloropropane in tetrahydrofuran resulted in 2-t-butyl-4-[4-(2-chloropropyl)piperazin-1-yl]-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidine.<br><br>
The inserted triazoles were obtained, if not stated otherwise, according to the method of S. Kubota et al., Chem Pharm Bull. 1975,23,955 by reacting the corresponding acid chlorides with alkyl thio semicarbazides in pyridine followed by cyclization in an aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate or by addition of the corresponding acid hydrazides with aklkyl thio isocyanates in a suitable solvent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
10.6 g (101.1 mmol) 4-methyl-3-thio semicarbazide and catalytic amounts of dimethyl amino pyridine were added to 10.2 g (45.1 mmol) 2-trichloracetoxy-N-methylpyrrol (obtained according to Rappoport et al., J. Org.
