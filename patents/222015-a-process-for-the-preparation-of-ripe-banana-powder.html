				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ripe banana powder. Banana is an important tropical fruit and is cultivated widely in India. Banana leads the total fruit production. A number of Cultivar varieties are available of which cavendish is the most common variety. The banana fruits are ripened and consumed widely fresh for table purpose. Banana is a rich source of nutrients viz., sugars, carotenes, minerals such as potassium, calcium, vitamin A and C. The fruit is also a good source of dietary fiber which is found to be very important for the digestion and bowl movement. The bananas are also processed into various processed products such as banana puree, banana juice, dried banana, banana powder etc., The process developed in the present invention facilitates the preparation of banana powder by spray drying and drum drying.<br>
Reference may be made to Siliha, H, El.Zoghbi, M. and Askar,A.1994. Foam mat drying of enzyme treated banana pulp, Flussiges-obstr; 61(8), wherein production of banana powder by foam mat drying was investigated. Enzymic treatment with commercial pectolytic enzymes was utilized to lower the viscosity of banana puree before foaming by addition of 1.5% foaming agent to warm banana puree. Banana powder prepared from enzymatically treated puree was characterized by higher reducing and non reducing sugars content than untreated control. It was concluded that banana powder prepared using Rohament P treated puree is suitable for the preparation of banana juice while that prepared using pectinex Ultra SPL or Novoferm is of use for ther preparation<br>
of baby foods. The main draw back of this process is it is a batch process and very laborious.<br>
Reference may be made to Mowlah-G, Takano-K, Kamoi-l, Obara, T. 1982. Effectos of drying methods on water sorption and color properties of dehydrated whole banana powders. J of Agricultural Science, 27 (2) 145-155, wherein effects of several dehydration processes on adsorption and color properties of dehydrated whole banana powders were investigated. It is concluded that 50 % reduction in original moisture content of banana slices by air drying and then drying to a final dehydrated product separately by dehydro freeze drying or vacuum drying yielded dehydrated whole banana powder. The main draw back of this process is it involves too many methods and is also a batch process where the output is very low.<br>
Reference may be made to Radhakrishnaiah shetty, G., Saroja.S, and Nanjundaswamy, A.M. 1979. Studies on drum drying of protein incorporated banana powder, Association of Food Scientists and Technologists^st Symposium), CFTRI, India, wherein a slurry of either groundnut or soy flour with banana pulp, sugar and corn starch was homogenized and drum dried; presence of corn starch improved flaking during drying. Optimum drying condition were steam pressure of 45 Ib/in2 and drum rotation speed of 3.5 rev/min. The dried product contained 16-17% protein, 48% sugar, 17% starch and high levels of Ca, P and Fe and was crisp in texture, free flowing, sweet and free from off flavors<br>
usually associated with vegetable flours. The product may be consumed as flakes or as a gruel. The main draw back of this process is it involves the incorporation of oil seed flours which affect the flavor and sensory characteristics of the drum dried banana powder.<br>
Reference may be made to Patil, D.L. and Magar, N.G. 1976. A comparative study on chemical examination of banana powders prepared by different methods, Ind J of Nut. and Diet. 13(7) 218-226, wherein banan powder prepared from 3 different banana varieties i.e. Basrai (musa cavendish) Rajeli and Safed velchi (Musa paraidsiaca) by vacuum oven drying or spray drying were analysed for proximate composition, minerals, vitamins and organoleptic characteristics. Vacuum drying was most successful and the product could be preserved for a long time in well sealed containers, powder produced by spray drying was more hygroscopic and the product was slightly shrunken in appearance. The main draw back of this method the product is not stable and vacuum drying is a batch process rendering low output of finished product.<br>
Reference may be made to Durance, Timothy Douglas, 1998, Process for drying mango and pineapples, US 5962057, wherein a vacuum microwave dehydration process for drying fresh mango and pineapple fruit pieces at low temperature which results in a product with a fresh uncooked flavor and a unique crunchy texture with little or no shrinkage which can not be achieved through conventional air drying. The process comprising the steps of first coating said fruit pieces with<br>
sugar to provide coated fruit pieces, storing said coated fruit pieces for a time sufficient to permit diffusion of said sugar into said coated fruit pieces to provide sugar infused fruit pieces, air drying said sugar infused fruit pieces to a moisture content of between 1 and 8KW/Kg of wet fruit pieces at a vacuum pressure of at least 22 inches Hg for a time required to reduce the moisture content to between 15 and 20% moisture based on the wet weight of the fruit pieces followed by applying a second stage of microwave vacuum drying to produce a dried mango and pineapple fruit pieces having significantly improved texture and flavor substantially free of cooked flavor. The main draw back of this process is it involves costly equipment and does not involve preparation of powder.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of ripe banana powder which obviates the draw backs as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of<br>
ripe banana powder with better color, flavor and sensory characteristics.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the banana<br>
powder without affecting the change in natural pH of the banana puree.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of ripe banana powder by spray drying.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a process for the<br>
preparation of ripe banana powder by drum drying.<br>
Accordingly  a   process  for the  preparation  of  ripe  banana   powder which comprises:<br>
a)	peeling of the ripe banana manually, dipping the peeled banana in an<br>
organic acid solution of 0.1 to 2.0%,<br>
b)	crushing the banana mechanically,<br>
c)	adding ascorbic acid or potassium metabisulfite at a concentration of 50<br>
ppm to 2000 ppm, refining the banana pulp to obtain banana puree,<br>
d)	pasteurizing the banana puree at temperature ranging from 65°C to 95°C,<br>
e)	separately   preparing   a   slurry   containing   such   as   pectin,   gums,<br>
carrageenan, tragacanth, in the range of 0.01% to 5%,<br>
f)	heating the slurry to 50-90°C, adding tricalcium phosphate in the range of<br>
0.01 to 2% to the said mixture,<br>
g)	blending the above, obtain slurry with the banana puree,<br>
h) characterized in that mixing and homogenizing the blended puree, passing through a spray drier with an inlet temperature ranging from 125°C to 160°C, alternatively passing through a drum drier with a steam pressure ranging from 4-6 bar with a drum rotating at a speed of 3-5 rpm and collecting the dried banana powder.<br>
In an embodiment of the above process the banana pulp may be pasteurized at specific temperature and cooled immediately to inactivate the enzymes.<br><br>
These and other objects are achieved, according to the invention where in a process for the preparation of ripe banana powder which comprises selection of bananas of optimum maturity, ripening the banana under controlled conditions to effect desired texture, washing, peeling of the ripe banana, dipping the peeled banana in an organic acid solution of 0.1 to 2.0% till crushing, crushing the banana in a mill, adding ascorbic acid or potassium metabisulfite at a concentration of 50 ppm to 2000ppm, refining the banana pulp obtained by passing through a stainless steel screen of 1/64", pasteurizing the banana puree at temperature ranging from 65°C to 95°C, cooling the banana puree, preparation of slurry of food grade starch, maltodextrin, polydextrose, food hydrocolloids such as pectin, gums, carrageenan, tragacanth or a combination of these, in the range of 0.01% to 5%, heating to 50-90°C, adding tricalcium phosphate in the range of 0.01 to 2% to the said mixture, blending the additives with the banana puree, mixing and homogenizing the blended puree, passing through a spray drier with an inlet temperature ranging from 125°C to 160°C, out let temperature of 105-120°C, alternatively passing through a drum drier with a steam pressure of 4-6 bar with a drum rotation of 3-5 rpm, collecting the dried banana powder in a suitable flexible packaging material and store.<br>
