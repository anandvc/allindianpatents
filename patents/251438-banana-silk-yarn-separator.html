				<td>BANANA SILK YARN SEPARATOR<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for producing silk yarns from Banana plants. Especially a device and a method for separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant which is having very good strength and shining color.<br>
Back ground of the invention<br>
The farmers are the back bone of our country. The farmers are very much worried about the fluctuating market with demand and supply, In Indian Sub-continent several farmers are cultivating banana plants and most of the times good market is not getting for banana and since lone rate in the market farmers are suffering a lot.<br>
After harvesting the bunch remaining portion of banana tree is treated as agricultural waste. In that banana pseudo stem, the main silk yarn is present in the outer layer of the sheath petiole. Hie structure of the banana sheath and the fiber is inolude within their matrix an appreciable amount of sap additionally each bundler and again the matrix of the fibers bundler include their with in a appreciable amount of sap. The sap containing natural resins, gums, phenol, quinoas etc hence. The pseudo stem are extremely tough longitudinal and exhibits high level of flexibility. Hence it is a need for a device for separating silk yarn from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The main1 objective of the invention is a device for separating silk yarn from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant which is having very good strength and shining color. <br>
The second objective of the invention is a method for separating silk yarn from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant. The third objective of the invention is for providing additional income to the banana farmer.<br>
SwnwftrY ftfth? jnvggtjon<br>
After harvesting the banana bunch the pseudostem is cut is to required length with the banana sheath outer layer in teared with the width of 2 to 3 inch Size and fed in to the soft material based blower and rubber hammer rotates the strips of the banana sheath layer get hammered and the ribbon structure is changed in to group of fiber bundles with certain amount of sap due to mechanical operation of the rubber hammer.<br>
When the matrix breaks due to mechanical operation the sap will come out from the matrix and react with the air and that time itself the entire quantity of sap and other liquid material is completely removed from the fibers then remaining part of the fibers is only silk yarn.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
A device for separating silk yarn from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant, the device comprising feeder rubber roller between the safety roller for receiving fibrous ribbon; the main rotor having rubber blades for hammering the said fibrous ribbon with the feeder rubber roller; the main rotor is attached with fan for blowing air; the electric motor is connected to the rotor by connecting means for rotating the rotor/fan; the said device further comprises of plurality of magnetic chuck clamping mechanisms for removing entire quantity of sap and other liquid materials from the fibers.<br>
The metho$J/or separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the banana plant comprising.<br>
(a)	cuttfag the pseudostem into required length.<br>
(b)	Extracting fibrous ribbon or sheath outer layer from the pseudostem which is the source of silk yarn.<br>
(c)	Feeding the said fibrous ribbon into the feeder roller and in turn to the main rotor having rubber blades for hammering the said fibrous ribbon thereby the ribbon structure will get collapsed and form fibers in small group with certain amount of sup and other liquid materials.<br>
(d)	Operating the clamping mechanism in the required pressure for removing entire quantity of sap and other liquid materials from the fibers.<br>
(e)	Take out the silk yarn which is separated from the tissue material.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
Figl: Shows the device for separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the pseudostem.<br>
Fig 2: Shows the clamping mechanism.<br>
Fig 3: Shows the single magnetic chuck clamping mechanism<br>
Fig 4: Shows the top view of the device.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 can be seen that the device for separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant comprises the feeder rubber roller (4) and safety roller (19), the main rotor having rubber blades (2), fan (3), air in taking area (20), plumber block (7), motor pulley (6), Electric motor (5), magnetic chuck operating handle (8).<br>
One end of the fibrous ribbon is fed into the feeder soft roller (rubber) (4) between the safety roller and other end is kept in the hand. When the main rotor (2) rotates that time it is having the soft material rubber blade for hammering the fibrous ribbon with the feeder rubber roller. The space between the feeder rubber roller and rotor rubber hammer (2A) is about 1 mm only. When the motor switched on, the main rotor, which is attached with the rubber hammer, will rotate around 700 rpm and that time the fiber strips inserted between feeder and hammer is hammered. Now the ribbon structure will become collapsed and changed fibers in small group along with certain amount of sap go towards ground. After the half-length of the ribbon is inserted inside the main rotor the hand lever (16) is pulled, and that time the magnetic chuck clamping mechanism as shown in fig 2 will be activated.<br>
The magnetic chuck clamp having magnet (13), blunted knife (9), wooden block (12), spring holder (17) and spring (10) which is connected with screws, The upper mechanic clampers having separate handles (15).<br>
When the handle is on the first down side, clamping mechanism will held the bundle of group fibers with certain pressure is the fiber will catch up tightly by the magnetic chuck, wooden chuck, and blunt knife and when the handle is lifted back the first down side clamper will filter 95% of sap and piths and along with the some portion of the pith will also thrown away by the blower air. After certain distance the fiber bundle is travel that second magnetic clamping mechanism will catch up the fiber bundles. The first down side magnetic chuck clamper will leave the fiber of 2-mm thickness.<br>
The second down side clamping mechanism will leaves the fiber of 1.8-mm thickness. The third and fourth magnetic clamping mechanisms also do the same job. The entire quantity of sap and other liquid material is completely removed from the fiber and the remaining will be good quality of silk yarn.<br>
Up to now only half-length of the fiber strips is extracted then remaining portion is again inserted to the machine. The same above operation can be carried out once again. At a time 40 to 50 strips can be inserted inside the feeder roller and hold by the corresponding magnetic chuck and pulled by hydraulic mechanism and the magnetic chucks are operated by PLC.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim: -<br>
1.	A device for separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the pseudostem of the banana plant, the device comprising feeder rubber roller (4) between the safety roller (19) for receiving the fibrous ribbon (of banana sheath strip) of banana plant; the main rotor (2) having rubber blades (2A) for hammering the said fibrous ribbon with the feeder rubber roller, the main rotor is attached with fan (3) for blowing air, the electric motor connected to the rotor (5)/fan; the said device further comprises of plurality of magnetic chuck clamping mechanisms for removing entire quantity of sap and other liquid materials from the fibers.<br>
2.	The device as claimed in claim (1) when in the said clamping mechanisms includes magnet chuck clamper having magnet (13), blunted knife (9), wooden block (12), spring (10), spring holder (17) and hand lever (15) for operating clamping mechanisms.<br>
3.	The method for separating silk yarns from the sheaths of the banana plant comprising<br>
(a)	Cutting the pseudostem in to the required length<br>
(b)	Extracting fibrous ribbon or sheath outer layer from the pseudostem, which is the source of silk yarn<br>
(c)	Feeding the said fibrous ribbon in to the feeder roller and in turn to the main rotor having rubber blades for hammering the said fibrous ribbon structure to get collapsed and form fibers in small group with certain amount of sap and other liquid materials<br>
(d)	Operating the clamping mechanism in the required pressure for removing the entire quantity of sap and other liquid materials from the fibers<br>
(e)	Take out the silk yarn which is separated from the tissue material<br>
4.	A method for separating silk yarns from the pseudostem of the banana plant substantially is described and illustrated in the figures of the accompanying drawing<br></td>
