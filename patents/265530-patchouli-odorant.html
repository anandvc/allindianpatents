				<td>PATCHOULI ODORANT<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns some derivatives of perhydro-1-naphthaleneol as defined further below and their<br>
use in perfumery to confer patchouli type odors. The present invention concerns also the<br>
compositions or articles containing said compound.<br>
Prior art<br>
To the best of our knowledge, none of the invention's compounds is known.<br>
Some unsaturated alcohols or ketones, having a similar structure, are known in<br>
perfumery as being useful ingredients (see EP 1605035, and the discussion further below).<br>
However, nowhere in the prior art it is suggested or anticipated that the present saturated<br>
alcohols/esters could be used as perfuming ingredients, and in particular to confer their<br>
particular fragrance.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered that a compound of formula<br><br>
in the form of any one of its stereoisomers or of a mixture thereof; and wherein each R,<br>
simultaneously or independently, represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
R1 represents a methyl or ethyl group;<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a formyl or acetyl group; and<br>
R3 represents a C1-3 alkyl group;<br>
can be used as perfuming ingredient, for instance to impart odor of the woody type, having<br><br>
in particular patchouli and/or ambery connotations.<br>
According to a particular aspect of the invention, said compounds of formula (I)<br>
are of formula<br><br>
i.e. with a R group in the position 6 or 7, wherein each R, simultaneously or independently,<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
R4 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and<br>
R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
According to another particular aspect of the invention, said compounds of formula<br>
(I) are of formula<br><br>
wherein R6, R7 and R8, simultaneously or independently, represent a hydrogen atom or a<br>
methyl group.<br>
In particular in said formula (III), one may cite the ones wherein R6, R7 and R8 are<br>
all hydrogen atoms or the ones wherein R7 is a methyl group and one of R6 and R8 is a<br>
hydrogen atom and the other a methyl group.<br>
Amongst the invention's compounds, one may cite perhydro-4-ethyl-8,8a-<br>
dimethyl-1-naphthalenol, one of the most appreciated by the perfumer. This compound<br><br>
possesses an odor of the woody type with a strong patchouli character. In fact the<br>
olfactive note of this compound belongs to the same family, and is close to, as the one of<br>
patchouli oil, and could be used as replacer of the known ingredient 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl-<br>
l-oxaspirol[4.5]decan-6-ol in a synthetic patchouli. Its overall fragrance can be described<br>
as being of the patchouli type with a rooty and ambery aspect.<br>
Others compounds of formula (I) are also described in Table (I) hereinbelow,<br>
together with their odors :<br><br>
The odor of these compounds distinguishes from the ones of the prior art structural<br>
analogues (and in particular the ones disclosed in EP 1605035) by lacking, or by not<br>
possessing a significant, citrus-grapefruit notes and/or the cedar, leather, ozone and/or<br><br>
agarwoods notes which are characteristic of the prior art compounds. Said differences lend<br>
the invention's compounds and the prior art compounds to be each suitable for different<br>
uses, i.e. to impart different organolpetic impressions.<br>
For example perhydro-4-ethyl-8,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenol differs from perhydro-<br>
4-ethyl-8,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenone, the structurally closest analogue disclosed in EP<br>
1605035, by lacking the typical grapefruit note of said prior art compound. Similarly,<br>
perhydro-4,6,8,8a-tetramethyl-l-naphthalenol distinguishes itself from the prior art<br>
compounds by lacking the citrus-grapefruit.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of a compound of formula (I)<br>
as perfuming ingredient, and in particular to confer an odor of the woody-patchouli and/or<br>
ambery type. In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify<br>
the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article, which method<br>
comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount of at least a compound<br>
of formula (I). By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the<br>
use of any composition containing compound (I) and which can be advantageously<br>
employed in perfumery industry as active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming<br>
ingredient, are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i)    as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii)   at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii)  optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system, i.e.<br>
a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A detailed<br>
description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery cannot be<br>
exhaustive.   However,   one   can   cite   as   non-limiting   example   solvents   such   as<br><br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise wall-<br>
forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or modified<br>
starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinylalcohols,<br>
proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as H. Scherz,<br>
Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel, Band 2 der<br>
Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH &amp; Co.,<br>
Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in the art,<br>
and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying, agglomeration<br>
or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including coacervation and<br>
complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition, and<br>
not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br><br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carriers, than those previously specified, can be also<br>
ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those<br>
known under the trademark Isopar® (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol<br>
ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical<br>
stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used in<br>
perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are<br>
well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I) and<br>
at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well<br>
as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least one<br>
perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords or perfumes possessing the odor tonality of various<br>
compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Preferably, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an<br>
adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a<br>
starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i)    as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I), as defined above, or an<br><br>
invention's perfuming composition; and<br>
ii)   a consumer product base ;<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional formulation,<br>
as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer product, e.g. a<br>
detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least one invention's<br>
compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the<br>
nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents and<br>
fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes,<br>
colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or<br>
gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br><br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.001 % to 15 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 10% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles, percentage being relative to the<br>
weight of the article.<br>
The invention's compounds can be prepared by hydrogenation/reduction of the<br>
corresponding unsaturated alcohol, or the corresponding ketone, described in<br>
EP 1605035. A typical example of such manner to prepare the invention's compounds is<br>
exposed hereinbelow.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C) ; the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCb<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 'H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements 8 are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
constants J are expressed in Hz. The NMR spectra are for the mixtures of isomers, unless<br>
specified.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of compounds of formula (T) by using the aldol derivative of -damascone as<br>
starting material<br>
General procedures:<br>
I)    General procedure for the Diels-Alder coupling<br>
In a 500 ml reactor were introduced the AlEtCk, or the A1C13, 0.1 g of BHT and<br>
toluene, or CH2CI2. Then, under vigorous stirring, was added the appropriate<br>
cyclohexenone dropwise, so as to maintain the temperature below 30°C. Afterwards<br>
was added the diene dropwise and when the reaction ended the reaction mixture was<br>
hydrolyzed with 5% aqueous HC1, extracted twice with Et2O. The organic layer was<br>
then washed with a saturated NaHCCh aqueous solution, water, brine and then dried<br><br>
over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvents, chromatography (SiO2, elution<br>
heptane/AcOEt 98:2) and distillation provided the end product.<br>
II)	General procedure for the reduction of the ketone into the alcohol<br>
In a 100 ml flask, maintained under Ar atmosphere, were introduced 2 molar<br>
equivalents, with respect of the ketone, of LiAlBU in Et2O. Then the appropriate<br>
naphthalenone was added dropwise, so as to maintain the reflux. After completion of<br>
the reaction the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at reflux. Afterwards the reaction<br>
mixture was hydrolyzed with a stoechiometric amount of aqueous NaOH and the<br>
organic layer was dried over Na2SO4- Evaporation of the solvents and distillation<br>
provided the end product.<br>
III)	General procedure for the hydrogenation of the naphthalenone into the perhydro<br>
naphthalenone<br>
In a 100 ml flask were introduced the appropriate naphthalenone, ethyl acetate and<br>
10% w/w, relative to the naphthalenone, of Pd/C 5%. The mixture was thus stirred<br>
under H2, at a room temperature, until consumption of the theoretical amount of<br>
hydrogen. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was filtered over Nylon 6/6. Evaporation<br>
of the solvents and distillation provided the end product.<br>
IV)	General procedure for the esterification of the alcohol<br>
In a 250 ml flask were introduced the appropriate alcohol, CH2C12,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, pyridine and the appropriate carboxylic anhydride. The<br>
mixture was thus stirred 24 hours at room temperature. When the reaction has<br>
finished the reaction mixture was hydrolyzed with 5% aqueous HC1, extracted twice<br>
with Et2O. The organic layer was then washed an aqueous solution of CUSO4, a<br>
saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution, water, brine and then dried over Na2SO4.<br>
Evaporation of the solvents provided the end product.<br>

The addition of 80 parts by weight of perhydro-4-ethyl-8,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenol to<br>
the above-described perfuming composition imparted to the latter an excellent woody<br>
character very close to the one of patchouli. Furthermore a camphoraceous aspect is<br>
developed, which impart to the new fragrance a nice freshness in the head-notes. Upon<br>
evaporation  of the  perfuming  composition,  the  ambery  aspect  of the  invention's<br>
compounds became more perceivable, adding thus a new pleasant effect to the patchouli<br>
dimension.<br>
When to the above-mentioned perfuming base was added the same amount of patchouli<br>
the new fragrance was earthier and less elegant than the one obtained with the invention's<br>
compound.<br>
When to the above-mentioned perfuming base was added the same amount of 4-ethyl-6,8-<br>
dimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenol  (a perfuming ingredient from the<br>
prior art) the base scent acquired a different woody character, which was of the vetiver<br>
type, furthermore it acquired also a grapefruit character which modified strongly the whole<br>
fragrance (less oriental type)<br><br>
When to the above-mentioned perfuming base was added the same amount of perhydro-4-<br>
ethyl-8-methyl-l-naphthalenone (a perfuming ingredient from the prior art) the base scent<br>
acquired a powerful sweet-powdery woody note with a vetyver type connotation.<br>
When to the above-mentioned perfuming base was added the same amount of perhydro-4-<br>
ethyl-8,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenone (a perfuming ingredient from the prior art) the base<br>
scent acquired a vetyver and grapefruit character, no patchouli note was perceivable.<br><br>
