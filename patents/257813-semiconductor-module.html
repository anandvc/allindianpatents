Description<br>
Semiconductor module<br>
Power semiconductors are used nowadays in many areas of<br>
technology, e.g. industrial automation technology. In order<br>
that the corresponding power semiconductors or the circuits<br>
realized with them are made manipulable, they are generally<br>
integrated into a housing, e.g. composed of plastic.<br>
Arrangements of this type are referred to as semiconductor<br>
modules and are e.g. contactors, motor starters or the like.<br>
During operation, power semiconductors cause heat losses that<br>
can lead to their continuous heating and - if the heat that<br>
arises is not dissipated - to their destruction. The heat loss<br>
is generally dissipated preferably by means of an air cooling<br>
system or else by means of a water cooling system which is<br>
coupled to the power semiconductor. For heat dissipation,<br>
corresponding cooling systems have to be pressed as well as<br>
possible on to the power semiconductor or a part that is<br>
thermally coupled thereto. One location of this type is<br>
generally the carrier layer, e.g. a printed circuit board<br>
composed of ceramic (DCB - direct copper bonding).<br>
In the case of large quantities of heat to be dissipated, e.g.<br>
in converters, it is known for the power semiconductor and the<br>
cooler to be screwed to one another. By way of example, the<br>
generally quadrangular printed circuit board is screwed by<br>
means of a screw at each corner on a heat sink. In this case,<br>
as a result of the screws being tightened nonuniformly, a<br>
tilting can be brought about between cooler and power<br>
semiconductor, which can lead e.g. to fracture of the printed<br>
circuit board. Moreover, screws can be forgotten or tightened<br>
incorrectly or not at all. A final inspection of a correctly<br>
tightened screw during the manufacture of a semiconductor<br>
module is extremely costly. As a result of the settling of the<br>
screw head on its support, e.g. a plastic housing of a<br>
semiconductor module, a loss of prestress can occur over time<br><br>
and the contact pressure between cooler and printed circuit<br>
board can become impermissibly low. Moreover, screwing together<br>
cooler and power semiconductor necessitates drilling or thread<br>
cutting in cooler and printed circuit board.<br>
For lower-power semiconductors, e.g. in the case of<br>
microprocessors in PCs, it is also known to clamp a cooler on<br>
to the semiconductor by means of clamping springs. The<br>
corresponding clamping springs may be forgotten during<br>
mounting. For the clamping springs to engage, corresponding<br>
receptacles at which clamping clips or the like find a hold are<br>
generally necessary both on the cooler and on the semiconductor<br>
or semiconductor module. This requires an additional<br>
manufacturing step during their production.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to specify a<br>
semiconductor module with improved contact pressing of cooler<br>
and power semiconductor.<br>
The object is achieved by means of a semiconductor module with<br>
a housing, wherein a power semiconductor and a cooler are<br>
contained in the housing. The cooler bears against a cooling<br>
surface, which is thermally coupled to the power semiconductor,<br>
and serves for dissipating the heat loss thereof via the<br>
cooling surface. The cooling surface can, of course, also be<br>
the power semiconductor itself; it is rarely the case, however,<br>
since the power semiconductor - as explained above - is<br>
generally arranged on a carrying structure, e.g. a printed<br>
circuit board, which then has the cooling surface.<br>
According to the invention, in the semiconductor module a<br>
spring element is provided which is supported between housing<br>
and cooler, is arranged on that side of the cooler which is<br>
remote from the cooling surface, and prestresses the cooler<br>
against the cooling surface.<br><br>
In the semiconductor module according to the invention,<br>
therefore, the pressing of the cooler on to the cooling surface<br>
and thus the power part or the power semiconductor is achieved<br>
by means of a spring element which is supported alongside the<br>
cooler not on the power semiconductor but rather on the<br>
housing. In this case, the support of the spring element on the<br>
housing or on the cooler does not have to be over the whole<br>
area. The cooler is consequently pressed against the cooling<br>
surface by means of the housing of the semiconductor module.<br>
Consequently, the housing absorbs the prestress force between<br>
cooler and power semiconductor. Since the spring element<br>
between cooler and housing is generally supported by clamping,<br>
mechanical processing of the cooler is not necessary. Coolers<br>
are generally produced by the extrusion method and sawn to the<br>
corresponding length. That side of the cooler which is remote<br>
from the power semiconductor is thus generally planar. Since<br>
the spring element is generally supported on this planar side,<br>
no further processing is necessary there.<br>
The process for assembling the semiconductor module is<br>
simplified since no screwing operation or connection by means<br>
of spring clips is necessary. Screws or spring clips cannot be<br>
forgotten.<br>
During the assembly of the semiconductor module, the spring<br>
element is generally inserted into the housing and then pressed<br>
or clamped in between housing and cooler by assembly of the<br>
rest of the housing. This simple assembly results in a low risk<br>
of faults. The rapid assembly and the saving of individual<br>
parts such as screws or spring clips result in a saving of<br>
costs. The assembly of a housing with inserted spring element<br>
can generally be effected in translational fashion, thereby<br>
avoiding tilting between cooler and power semiconductor.<br>
The number of parts in the semiconductor module is reduced and<br>
the abovementioned loss of prestress of screws is avoided,<br>
particularly if the spring element bears against the housing or<br><br>
cooler over a large area. A simple quality control after<br>
assembly of the semiconductor module is possible since it is<br>
limited to the presence of the spring element, which, if it has<br>
been inserted then, that is to say is present, given a suitable<br>
configuration - e.g. in plate or disk form - cannot be inserted<br>
incorrectly.<br>
In this case, in a first embodiment of the invention, the<br>
spring element can be formed as a separate component. Suitable<br>
spring elements can then be stocked or replaced.<br>
The spring element can be a spring, in particular a spiral or<br>
leaf spring. Spring elements of this type are available cost-<br>
effectively as mass-produced products.<br>
The spring element can be an elastomer element. High press-on<br>
forces, e.g. comparable with a quadruple screw joint, can be<br>
achieved by corresponding selection and configuration of an<br>
elastomer part. Moreover, the elasticity of the elastomer makes<br>
it possible to compensate for large geometrical tolerances of<br>
the semiconductor module in conjunction with, nevertheless, a<br>
sufficient contact pressure.<br>
The elastomer element can be configured in plate form. As a<br>
result, it bears particularly well against cooler or housing.<br>
In a second alternative embodiment of the invention, the spring<br>
element can also be formed integrally with the housing. In this<br>
case, the spring element can e.g. be integrated in the housing<br>
by casting in if this is intrinsically a prefabricated separate<br>
part, such as e.g. a spring. However, the spring element can<br>
also be integrally formed directly on to the housing.<br>
The spring element can be an elastic partial structure of the<br>
housing. Thus, there may be present e.g. on the housing knobs,<br>
protrusions or shaped portions facing toward the inside of said<br>
housing, that is to say toward the cooler. The spring property<br><br>
of the spring element or the pressing of the cooler on	to the<br>
cooling surface can then be provided by the elasticity	of the<br>
housing material and the e.g. geometrical configuration	of the<br>
corresponding integrally formed portions.<br>
The housing can have a latching device for the assembly of the<br>
semiconductor module under prestress of the spring element. The<br>
spring element is then e.g. inserted into the housing, the<br>
cooler is placed thereon and after, for the assembly of the<br>
semiconductor module, the power module or a corresponding<br>
second housing part is pressed onto the housing to an extent<br>
such that the corresponding prestress arises with compression<br>
of the spring element, the latching device latching in place<br>
only in the prestressed state.<br>
A corresponding latching can be achieved by manual assembly of<br>
the housing or pressing by means of a pressing device for<br>
higher contact pressures.<br>
The latching device can also engage into a partial structure<br>
carrying the power semiconductor or a part of the semiconductor<br>
module. A partial structure of this type is e.g. a preassembled<br>
power part comprising the semiconductor, the printed circuit<br>
board and a housing (upper) part. The latching device can also<br>
engage into the carrying structure, e.g. printed circuit board,<br>
or directly into the power semiconductor.<br>
The housing can also have a screw joint for assembly of the<br>
semiconductor module with prestress of the spring element. The<br>
screw joint then replaces or supplements the abovementioned<br>
latching in the same mode of operation.<br>
For a further description of the invention, reference is made<br>
to the exemplary embodiments in the drawings, in which in each<br>
case in a schematic basic diagram:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a semiconductor module in cross section with an<br>
elastomer element as spring element,<br>
Figure 2 shows a semiconductor module in accordance with<br>
figure 1 in an alternative embodiment with press-on<br>
contour integrally formed onto the housing,<br>
Figure 3 shows a force-displacement diagram for the elastomer<br>
element in figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a semiconductor module 2, comprising a power<br>
part 4, a cooler 6 and a cooler housing 8. A printed circuit<br>
board 10 together with power semiconductors 12 mounted thereon<br>
forms the actual power semiconductor circuit 14. The circuit 14<br>
is connected to a housing upper part 16, in the example by<br>
means of a snap-action connection (not illustrated), in order<br>
together with this to form the power part 4.<br>
The cooler 6 comprises a cooler plate 18 and fins 20 integrally<br>
formed thereon. By its top side 22, the cooler plate 18 bears<br>
against the underside 24 of the printed circuit board 10, which<br>
represents the cooling surface for the power semiconductors 12.<br>
Thermally conductive paste (not illustrated) is introduced<br>
between the two. Heat loss from the semiconductor 12 is<br>
therefore conveyed via the printed circuit board 10 to the<br>
cooler plate 18 and to the cooling fins 20, through which<br>
cooling air flows. Between cooler 6 and cooler housing 8, an<br>
elastomer plate 34 is pressed on the base 32 of said housing.<br>
The cooler housing 8 essentially has the form of a<br>
parallelpiped open toward the top, that is to say toward the<br>
power part 4, that is to say is U-shaped in the cross section<br>
shown in figure 1. The cooler housing 8 has a plurality of<br>
cutouts 26 serving for engagement with latching lugs 28 which<br>
are in turn integrally formed on the housing upper part 16.<br>
Figure 1 shows the semiconductor module 2 in the finished<br>
assembled state. The following procedure is adopted during<br>
assembly: Firstly, in the direction of the arrow 30, an<br><br>
elastomer plate 32 is inserted into the as yet empty cooler<br>
housing 8 on to the inner side of the base 32. Afterward, the<br>
cooler 6 with the cooling fins 20 ahead is inserted into the<br>
cooler housing 8 likewise in the direction of the arrow 30.<br>
Afterward, the top side 22 is coated with thermally conductive<br>
paste and the preassembled housing upper part 16 with the<br>
underside 24 of the printed circuit board 10 ahead is placed<br>
onto the cooler 6. The elastomer plate 34 is as yet<br>
uncompressed and has the thickness d0. In the current<br>
situation, the latching lugs 28 cannot yet be brought into<br>
engagement with the cutouts 26 since the housing upper part 16<br>
still projects from the cooler housing 8 counter to the<br>
direction of the arrow 30. By applying a force in the direction<br>
of the arrow 30 onto the housing upper part 16, the power part<br>
4 together with the cooler 6 is then pressed in the direction<br>
of the base 32 and the elastomer plate 34 is compressed in the<br>
process, such that its thickness decreases from the initial<br>
value d0 to the compressed thickness di by a displacement<br>
s=do~di. The latching lugs 28 then latch into the cutouts 26.<br>
The elastomer part is now supported between base 32 and cooling<br>
fins 20 or the underside 36 thereof and generates respective<br>
press-on forces there which also act in each case between<br>
cooler 6, printed circuit board 10, housing upper part 16 or<br>
latching lugs 28 and cooler housing 8 or cutout 26. By this<br>
means, therefore, in particular the cooler plate 18 is<br>
prestressed against the printed circuit board 10 on the cooling<br>
surface.<br>
Figure 3 shows a curve 52 in a force-displacement diagram by<br>
way of example for the elastomer plate 34. The compression<br>
displacement s, that is to say the difference between do and d1<br>
from figure 1, is plotted on the abscissa and the force F<br>
supplied back by the elastomer plate 34 is plotted on the<br>
ordinate.<br><br>
The geometrical dimensioning of the semiconductor module 2 is<br>
embodied in such a way that in the finished assembled state in<br>
accordance with figure 1, the elastomer plate is compressed by<br>
s0 with respect to the initial thickness d0. This results in a<br>
press-on force of F0 between the cooler plate 18 and the<br>
printed circuit board 10, which ensures sufficient thermal<br>
conduction. The entire component tolerances in the<br>
semiconductor module 2 are designed in such a way that in one<br>
extreme case, the elastomer plate 34 is still compressed by Smin<br>
proceeding from the thickness d0. The minimum press-on force<br>
therefore turns out to be Fmin, in figure 3. In the case of the<br>
opposite maximum tolerance situation, a compression of the<br>
elastomer plate 34 by smax results, which leads to a press-on<br>
force of Fmax. The elastomer plate 34 can therefore compensate<br>
for geometrical tolerances As within a wide range of<br>
Δs=smax_smin without in the process bringing about an<br>
impermissibly low or high contact pressure in the semiconductor<br>
module 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment of a semiconductor<br>
module 2 which is otherwise structurally identical to figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a section along the line II-II from figure 1,<br>
figure 1 showing a section along the line I-I through figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 therefore also reveals the mounting structure 72<br>
integrally formed on the cooler housing 8, said mounting<br>
structure serving for fixing the semiconductor module 2 e.g. in<br>
a switchgear cabinet. The elastomer plate 34 from figure 1 is<br>
replaced in figure 2 by protrusions 70 in the base 32 of the<br>
cooler housing 8, said protrusions being directed toward the<br>
interior of the cooler housing 8. In this case, the protrusions<br>
70 are introduced into the cooler housing 8 by cutting free and<br>
deforming the material of the cooler housing 8, e.g. plastic,<br>
and are compressively elastic in the direction of the arrow 30.<br>
Therefore, the spring element according to the invention is in<br>
this case embodied integrally with the cooler housing 8.<br><br>
The protrusions 70 are in each case supported at a plurality of<br>
locations over the length of a cooling fin 20. Through<br>
corresponding geometrical configuration of the protrusions 70<br>
or a material selection of the cooler housing 8, a force-<br>
displacement characteristic curve corresponding to that with<br>
regard to the curve 52 from figure 3 can be realized for said<br>
protrusions. Figure 2 also reveals that the cooler 6 is cut<br>
from an extruded profile extending in the direction of the<br>
arrow 74. The top side 22 and underside 36 are therefore planar<br>
in the direction of the arrow 74 as early as production.<br>
In figure 2, in contrast to figure 1, moreover, the latching<br>
comprising latching lugs 28 and cutouts 26 is replaced by a<br>
screw joint 76 (not explained in greater detail), which presses<br>
the housing upper part 16 down against a cooler housing 8 in<br>
the direction of the arrow 30 and thus compresses the<br>
protrusions 70 to the thickness d1.<br><br>
