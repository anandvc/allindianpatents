Background of the Invention Artherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world. Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dysiipidemia with dietary modification and drug therapy, coronary hard disease (CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S., where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all deaths, with 53% of these associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.<br>
Risk for development of this condition has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. While elevated LDL C may be the most recognized form of dysiipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low HDL-C is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, DJ., et al,: "High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease", Circulation, (1989), 79: 8-15).<br>
High LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Thus, dysiipidemia is not a unitary risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more lipid aberrations.<br>
Among the many factors controlling plasma levels of these disease dependent principles, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity effects all three. The role of this 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein found in a number of animal species, including humans, is to transfer cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between lipoprotein particles, including high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol. This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be proatherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for CHD.<br>
Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,197,786 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference) discloses certain CETP inhibitors including<br>
[2R4S]]-4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-ben2yl)-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-2-ethyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-qufnoIine-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester also known as torcetrapjb^Jn-addition, these CETP inhibitors are disclosed as being useful for such indications as atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injdury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity or endotoxemia.<br>
In addition, the CETP inhibitors are stated to be useful in combination with a second compound, said compound being an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, an microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)/Apo B secretion inhibitor, a PPAR activator, a bile acid reuptake inhibitor, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, a fibrate, niacin, an ion-exchange resin, an antioxidant, an ACAT inhibitor or a bile acid sequestrant.

Given the positive correlation between lipid modulation and lipid fraction modulation in blood with the development of various disease/conditions such as cardiovascular, cerebral vascular and peripheral vascular diseases, the compounds/combinations of this invention and the salts of such compounds, by virtue of their pharmacologic action, are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or treatment of disease states/conditions as described above. These include cardiovascular disorders (e.g., angina, cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction) and complications due to cardiovascular disease.   In particular, given the correlation   between HDL modulation and the disease/conditions described above the CETP compounds described herein and combinations thereof by virtue of their HDL modulating pharmacologic action (e.g., HDL elevation) are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or treatment of the disease states/conditions as described above. The utility of the compounds/combinations of the invention and the salts of such compounds as medical agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in mammals (e.g. humans, male or female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of this invention in conventional assays (e.g., in vivo assays, in vitro assays) known to those skilled in the art including those described herein. In particular, the PLASMA LIPIDS ASSAY described below may be used to determine the level.of HDL modulation for a given compound/combination and thus its therapeutic impact for the disease/conditions described above. Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the compounds/combinations of this invenlion and the salts of such compounds (or the other agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases.   For example, the characterization of the impact of of the compounds/combinations of this invention and the salts of such compounds {or the other agents described herein) on various lipid fractions can be determined by methods known in the art as are described in<br>
Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 129: Plasma Lipoproteins, Pt. B: Characterization, Cell Biology, and Metabolism.    Albers, John J.; Segrest, Jere P.; Editors.    USA. (1986),    (Academic Press, Orlando, Fla.) and Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 128: Plasma Lipoproteins, Pt. A: Preparation, Structure, and Molecular Biology. Segrest, Jere P.; Albers, John J.; Editors.    USA.    (1986),     992 pp. (Academic Press, Orlando, Fla.). In particular, the PLASMA LIPIDS ASSAY described below may be used to determine the level of HDL modulation for a given compound/combination and thus its therapeutic impact for the disease/conditions described above.<br>
The following are exemplary assays.<br>
CETP IN VITRO ASSSAY The following is a brief description of the assay of cholesteryl ester transfer in human plasma (in vitro) and animal plasma (ex vivo): CETP activity in the presence or absence of drug is assayed by determining the transfer of 3H-labeled cholesteryl oleate (CO) from exogenous tracer HDL to the nonHDL lipoprotein fraction in human plasma, or from 3H-labeled LDL to the HDL fraction in transgenic mouse plasma. Labeled human lipoprotein substrates are prepared similarly to the method described by Morton in which the endogenous CETP activity in plasma is employed to transfer 3H-CO from phospholipid liposomes to all the lipoprotein fractions in plasma. 3H-labeled LDL and HDL are subsequently isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at the density cuts of 1.019-1.063 and 1.10-1.21 g/ml, respectively. For the activity assay, 3H-labeled lipoprotein is added to plasma at 10-25 nmoles CO/ml and the samples incubated at 37° C for 2.5-3 hrs. Non-HDL lipoproteins are then precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Dias). The samples are centrifuged 750 g x 20 minutes and the radioactivity contained in<br>
i<br>
the HDL containing supernatant determined by liquid scintillation. Introducing varying quantities of the compounds of this invention as a solution in dimethylsulfoxide to human plasma, before addition of the radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate, and comparing the relative amounts of radiolabel transferred allows relative cholesteryl ester transfer inhibitory activities to be determined.<br>
CETP IN VIVO ASSSAY Activity of these compounds in vivo can be determined by the amount of agent required to be administered, relative to control, to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer activity by 50% at various time points ex vivo or to elevate HDL cholesterol<br>
by a given percentage in a CETP-containing animal species. Transgenic mice expressing both human CETP and human apolipoprotein Al (Charles River, Boston, MA) may be used to assess compounds in vivo. The compounds to be examined are administered by oral gavage in an emulsion vehicle containing olive oil and sodium taurocholate. Blood is taken from mice retroorbitally before dosing. At various times after dosing, ranging from 4h to 24h, the animals are sacrificed, blood obtained by heart puncture, and lipid parameters measured, including total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. CETP activity is determined by a method similar to that described above except that 3H-cholesteryI oleate containing LDL is used as the donor source as opposed to HDL. The values obtained for lipids and transfer activity are compared to those obtained prior to dosing and/or to those from mice receiving vehicle alone.<br>
PLASMA LIPIDS ASSAY The activity of these compounds may also be demonstrated by determining the amount of agent required to alter plasma lipid leVels for example HDL cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, VLDL cholesterol levels or triglycerides, in the plasma of certain mammals, for example marmosets that possess CETP activity and a '<br>
r<br>
plasma lipoprotein profile similar to.that of humans (Crook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625, 1990). Adult marmosets are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean ±SD for total, HDL, and/or LDL plasma cholesterol concentrations. After group assignment, marmosets are dosed daily with compound as a dietary admix or by intragastric intubation for from one to eight days. Control marmosets receive only the dosing vehicle. Plasma total, LDL, VLDL and HDL cholesterol values can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from an antecubital vein and separating plasma lipoproteins into their individual subclasses by density gradient centrifugation, and by measuring cholesterol concentration as previously described (Crook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625, 1990).<br>
Conventional clinical designs and methods of modifying those clinical protocols to facilitate the testing of the compounds/combinations of this invention and the salts of such compounds (or the other agents described herein) for the various disease/conditions described above are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, in such clinical studies levels of atherosclerotic plaque can be measured by various imaging techniques e.g., Intracardiac ultrasound (ICE),<br>
quantitative coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) including coronary intravascular ultrasound, corotid intimal medial thickness (CIMT) measurement, magnetic resonance imaging (MR!)', magnetic resonance coronary angiography, flow-mediated dilatation, positron emission tomography, multislice computed tomography,, electron beam computed tomography (EBT), mechanical multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT), echo cardiography, coronary angiography, radiography and radionucleotide imaging.<br>
These imaging techniques and the interpretation of them are known and are further described in for example, "Measurement of Subclinical Atherosclerosis:beyond risk factor assessment", Current Opinion in Lipidology 13, 595-603 (2002); "A Comparison of Intravascular, Ultrasound With Coronary Angiography for Evaluation of Transplant Coronary Disease in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients", Journal of Heart &amp; Lung Transplantation 22, 44-49 (2003); and "Assessment of Calcium Scoring Performance in Cardiac Computed Tomography", European Radiology 13, 484-97 (2003).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of this invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier or diluent. Thus, the compounds of this invention can be administered either individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral or transdermal dosage form.<br>
For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of this invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents<br>
and/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
The combinations of this invention may also be adminstered in a controlled<br>
release formulation such as a slow release or a fast release formulation. Such	<br>
controlled release formulations of the combination of this invention may be prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. The method of adminstration will be determined by the attendant physician or other person skilled in the art after an evaluation of the subject's condition and requirements. The generally preferred formulation of amlodipine is Norvasc®.<br>
Many of the CETP inhibitors of this invention are poorly soluble and a dosage form that increases solubility facilitates the administration of such compounds. One such dosage form is a dosage form comprising (1) a solid amorphous dispersion comprising a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor and an acidic concentration-enhancing polymen and (2) an acid-sensitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This dosage form is more fully described in U.S. provisional application serial no. 60/435345 filed on December 20, 2002 and entitled "Dosage Forms Comprising a CETP Inhibitor and an HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor" the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The compounds of this invention either alone or in combination with each other or other compounds generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Combination tablets of amlodipine besylate, torcetrapib, and atorvastatin hemicalcium were prepared at a scale of ~1kg according to the procedure immediately following the Table. The doses prepared and the composition of the tablets are detailed in the following Table.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A separate granulation or blend of each active component was prepared<br>
initially and these three powder mixtures were combined in different proportions to<br>
provide the desired dose combinations.<br>
The atorvastatin hemicalcium granulation was prepared by making a,solution<br>
of the hydroxypropyl cellulose and polysorbate 80 in water. The remaining<br>
components (except magnesium stearate) were then charged to a fluid bed<br>
—granulator and wet-granulated with the binder solution by fluidizing them in a warm air stream (30-60C) while spraying the binder solution onto the powders in the granulator. After all the binder solution had been sprayed the granules were dried in the fluidized bed, and milled to remove any large (&gt;1mm) agglomerates. The granules were lubricated by blending them with magnesium stearate.<br>
A dispersion of torcetrapib in the polymer hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) acetate succinate was made by dissolving both components in<br>
acetone and spray drying (see U.S. provisional application serial-no. 60/435,345)  the resulting solution in conventional spray drying equipment. The torcetrapib granulation was made by blending the resulting spray dried dispersion, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, and magnesium stearate together and dry<br>
i<br>
granulating the powder blend by roller compaction. Standard pharmaceutical roller compaction equipment and operating conditions were used. The resulting compacted ribbons were milled to produce granules suitable for further processing. The calcium phosphate and magnesium stearate were added and blended with the granules to create the final lubricated torcetrapib blend.<br>
The amlodipine besylate was simply blended with its excipients to produce a lubricated amlodipine powder blend.<br>
The three active granulations/blends were blended together in the desired proportions using a low-shear twin-shell blender and tableted using a single punch eccentric tablet press.<br>
Administration of the compounds of this invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally. These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenal routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intraveneous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary) may be utilized,<br>
for example, where oral administration is inappropriate for the target or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug.<br>
These methods and combinations are useful depending on the indication/condition to treat mammals including humans.   In addition, they are useful to advantageously and/or selectively treat a variety of patient subgroups including males, females, the elderly (&gt;60), infants (
In general an amount of a compound(s)/combination(s) of this invention is used that is sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect desired (e.g., HDL elevation). The amount will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the severity of the affliction, on the manner of administration and on the judgement of the prescribing physician.<br>
In general an effective dosage for the CETP inhibitors of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and progrugs is in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.1 to about 5 mg/kg/day.<br>
An especially preferred dosage of [2R,4S]-4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-2-ethyl-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (torcetrapib) is about 15mg per day to about 240 mg per day, preferably about 30 mg per day to about 120 mg per day. The dosage may be administered in single or multiple dosages (e.g., bid).<br>
A dosage of the combination pharmaceutical agents (e.g., antihypertensive agents, statins) to be used in conjunction with the CETP inhibitors is used that is effective for the indication being treated.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for atorvastatin calcium (known as atorvastatin hemicalcium or LIPITOR) or other salts of atorvastatin is about 10 mg to about 80 mg per day (e.g., 10mg, 20mg, 40mg 80mg).<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for antihypertensives is in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage of amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., amlodipine besylate, amlodipine mesylate) is in the range of about 5 mg to about 10 mg per day.<br>
An exemplary dosage for the triple combination of amlodipine and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., amlodipine besylate)/atorvastatin and i a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., atorvastatin hemicalcium)/ and [2R,4S]-4-[(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-ben2yl)-methoxycarbonyI-amino]-2-ethyl-6-trifluoro methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (torcetrapib) is in the range of 5-10mg per day/10-80mg per day/30-120mg per day.<br>
For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may contain 0.1%-95% of the compound(s) of this invention, preferably 1 %-70%. In any event, the composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the invention in an amount effective to treat the condition or disease of the subject being treated.<br>
Since the'present invention relates to the treatment of diseases and conditions with a combination of active ingredients which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining'separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit includes two separate pharmaceutical compositions: amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof and a statin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association. The kit can include an exemplary container means for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically the kit includes directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by_the prescribing physician.<br>
An example of such a kit is so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the fact of the foil whichis opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening' is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
