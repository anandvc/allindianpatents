BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium and to a method for manufacturing the same. Description of the Background Art<br>
Generally, it is a wide spread practice in manufacturing a magnetic recording medium to apply a magnetic layer on a base film and to perform calendering thereafter.<br>
Generally, in the process of manufacturing a magnetic recording medium, a magnetic recording medium is :alendered by running  between a mirror-surfaced metal roll and an elastic roll such as a resin roll opposed to thereto while applying high nip pressure, so as to iliminate voids of the magnetic layer, to make smooth the urface of the magnetic recording medium and to increase ensity of the magnetic layer.  In this case, the magnetic ayer side of the magnetic recording medium is brought nto contact with the metal roll.<br>
Signal density of the magnetic recording medium has sen  significantly improved recently.  In order to obtain<br><br>
a highly dense magnetic recording medium, it is necessary to apply a magnetic coating filled with magnetic powder to a high density on the base film so as to increase magnetic flux density.  However, if the amount of the magnetic powder is increased, it becomes difficult to eliminate voids in the magnetic layer generated when solvent is dried, and it has been also difficult to obtain sufficient surface smoothness of the magnetic layer under the conventional conditions for calendering, because hardness of the magnetic coating could have been increased.<br>
Accordingly, in order to make smooth the surface of the above described magnetic layer filled with magnetic powder to a high density and to eliminate voids perfectly, it,becomes necessary to apply higher temperature and higher nip pressure in the step of calendering.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a demand for a resin roll for calendering which can be used at higher temperature and which can provide greater pressure.<br>
The following characteristics are required of the resin roll for calendering.<br>
(1)	Satisfactory roll high surface smoothness.<br>
(2)	Hardness, especially high surface hardness.<br>
(3)	Heat resistance.  Especially heat resistance to render the roll less likely to deform due to thermal expansion or melting that would result from autogenous<br><br>
heat.<br>
(4)	Compression strength to withstand the high nip<br>
pressure applied by the metal roll for the roll to remain<br>
free of cracking or breaking.<br>
(5)	Free of pin holes in the roll.<br>
However, in the conventional resin roll for<br>
calendering a magnetic recording medium, roll properties are limited, so that nip width, that is, nip area tends to be unavoidably large.  Therefore, in terms of applied pressure, that is, pressure per unit area acting on the nip surface, satisfactory pressure by unit area to meet the recent demand for high density magnetic recording medium could not be obtained.  Further, in order to improve efficiency in processing, when heating is performed at higher temperature or when the press load is increased to obtain larger pressure by unit area, the nip width, that is, the nip area is further enlarged, making it difficult to obtain the effective pressure by unit area at the nip surface. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium of which nip width is smaller than in the prior art under similar load, of which nip width is not increased even under high load at high temperature, thus providing<br><br>
substantially larger pressure per unit area, of which surface is smooth and surface hardness is high, which has superior compression strength and heat resistance and which is free of pin holes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the above described high performance resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium at low cost with high efficiency.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a calendering apparatus employing the above described high performance resin roll as an elastic roll.<br>
The above described objects of the present invention are attained by the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium including a metal roll core and a thermosetting resin outer layer, wherein surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer has a storage elastic modulus (E') from 5 x 10 to 5 x 1010 dyn/cm2 at a temperature in the range from 50 to 150°C at a frequency of 10 hertz (Hz).  More specifically, according to the present invention, the storage elastic modulus (E') of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the resin roll for calendering at a temperature of use is increased, whereby the nip width can be made smaller, and as the high storage elastic modulus (E') of the surface portion is maintained even at a high temperature, the<br><br>
small nip width can be maintained.<br>
Preferably, the storage elastic modulus (E') at the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the roll should be at least 6 x 1010 dyn/cm2, and more preferably, it should be at least 8 x 1010 dyn/cm2. Preferably, it should be at most 2 x 1010 dyn/cm2, and more preferably, it should be at most 1.5 x 1011  dyn/cm2.<br>
The conditions for measurement for temperature and frequency described above are set as close as possible to the conditions for use of the resin roll for calendering. The temperature is normally in the range from 50 to 150°C, which is preferably 50 to 180°C and, more preferably, 50 to 200°C.<br>
The frequency is set to 10 hertz.  This value is selected from the following reasons.  If the outer, periphery of the resin roll for calendering is set to Im and the running speed to 300m/min, for example, the number of rotation of the roll is 300 rpm, and the frequency corresponding to this number of rotation is 5 Hz. However, if the resin roll for calendering is pinched between two metal rolls, the surface portion of the roll passes twice the nip per one rotation, and hence the frequency is set to 10 Hz.<br>
In the foregoing, if the storage elastic modulus (E') at the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer<br><br>
layer of the resin roll for calendering is not higher than 5 X 1010 dyn/cm2, the nip width becomes too large, resulting in similar pressure per unit area as that of the prior art, and hence it is not preferable.  If the storage elastic modulus (E') exceeds 5 x 1010 dyn/cm2, the nip width becomes smaller and larger pressure per unit area can be obtained.  However, since the storage elastic modulus (E') is too large, ups and downs of the material to be processed cannot be absorbed by the roll surface, hindering uniform calendering.  Therefore, it is not preferable.<br>
The thermosetting resin constituting the outer layer of the resin roll for calendering includes, for example, epoxy resin, polyurethane resin, polyisocyanurate resin, cross linked polyesteramide resin, unsaturated polyester resin and diallylphthalate resin.  In view of durability, heat resistance and moldability, epoxy resin and cross linked polyesteramide resin are preferable, and specifically, epoxy resin is desired.<br>
The aforementioned metal roll core is made of a metal such as iron, steel, stainless steel or aluminum.<br>
From another view point, the resin roll for calendering magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention includes a metal roll core and a thermosetting resin outer layer, wherein an expression (1<br><br>
-v2)/E' representing relation between storage elastic modulus (E') and the Poisson's ratio (p)   with respect to Hertz's equation representing nip width of the surface portion of the thermosetting outer layer is within the range of<br>
5 X 10-11 cm2/dyn 
In the above expression, E' represents storage elastic modulus of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the resin roll, and v represents the Poisson's ratio of the surface portion.<br>
Here, generally, it is known that the nip width when two rolls are in contact with and parallel to each other and subjected to a load (P) per unit length in axial direction can be represented by the Hertz's equation<br><br><br><br>
where<br>
N: nip width<br>
Rl: radius of first roll<br>
R2: radius of second roll<br>
P: load power unit length<br>
v1: Poisson's ratio of the first roll<br>
v2= Poisson's ratio of the second roll<br>
E] : elastic modulus of the first roll<br>
E2: elastic modulus of the second roll<br>
7: : the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its<br>
diameter.<br>
In the foregoing, if the first roll is the resin roll for calendering and the second roll is a metal roll, for example, it is understood that the nip width (N) is in proportion to a squire root of (K1 + K2) provided that the radii (R1 , R2) of both rolls and the load (P) are constant.<br>
When the relation between the resin roll and the nip width is considered, the nip width (N) is influenced by the value of (1 - v2)/E1.<br>
In other words, the smaller the value (1 - v2 )/E1 of<br><br>
the surface of the resin roll, the smaller the nip width<br>
(N).<br>
The foregoing is a theory assuming a static<br>
condition. When the roll in actual use is considered, the<br>
slastic modulus (Ei) must be considered as a dynamic elastic modulus, that is, storage elastic modulus.<br>
Conventionally, the importance of the relation between temperature and storage elastic modulus (E') of the resin roll for calendering have been recognized. However, the Poisson's ratio (v) has not been considered. Based on the theory described above, the inventors recognized that the relation between each of temperature, storage elastic modulus (E') and Poisson's ratio ( i/)   is important, and through extensive study, they have found that the resin roll providing desirable nip width as a resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium has the value within the following range: 2 X 10-11 cm2/dyn 
 <br>
preferable.<br>
Further, if the value of the expression (1 - i/2 )/E' exceeds 2 x 10-  cm2/dyn, the nip width becomes too large, and only the pressure per unit area similar to that of the prior art can be obtained.  Therefore, it is not preferable.<br>
Preferably, the value of the expression (1 - i/2 )/E' should be at least 5 x lO-12 cm2/dyn, and more preferably, it should be at least 6 x 10-12 cm2/dyn.  Preferably, it should be at most 1.8 x 10-12 cm2/dyn and, more preferably, it should be at most 1.5 x 10-12 cm2/dyn.<br>
Here, the measuring condition of temperature is set to be 50 to 150°C as described above.  Preferably, the temperature should be from 50 to 180°C, and more preferably from 50 to 200°C.<br>
The frequency is set to 10 Hz from the same reason as described above.<br>
According to the present invention, as the value of the expression (1 - y^)/'^'   representing the relation between storage elastic modulus (E') and Poisson's ratio . ( V) at the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the resin roll is small, the nip width can be made smaller, and as the value of the expression (1   -   y 2)/E' is maintained at a small value' even at a high<br><br>
temperature, small nip width can be maintained.<br>
The thickness of thermosetting resin outer layer is, appropriately, from 5 to 50 mm.<br>
In the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention, normally, the thermosetting resin outer layer is filled with inorganic powder, and the surface portion of thermosetting resin outer layer is uniformly filled with high percentage content of the inorganic powder.  The percentage content of the inorganic powder at the surface portion of the resin outer layer is from 60 to 95 percent by weight.<br>
Here, the inorganic powder includes carbon black, quartz powder, silica powder, silicon oxide, silicon carbide, glass powder, alumina, titanium oxide, potassium titanate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, clay, glass beads, bentonite, iron powder, copper powder, aluminum powder and ferrite powder.<br>
The average particle diameter of inorganic powder is from 0.05 to 50.0 um.<br>
Since the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the resin roll is uniformly filled with high percentage content of inorganic powder, the elastic roll comes to have high strength, high hardness, and high storage modulus, and hence the nip width can be made<br><br>
smaller.<br>
If the content of inorganic powder at the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of the resin roll is smaller than 60 percent by weight, necessary strength, hardness, or elastic modulus cannot be obtained. If the content of the inorganic powder exceeds 95 percent by weight, viscosity of slurry-like mixture of thermosetting resin material and inorganic powder becomes too high, making it difficult to cast the thermosetting resin outer layer of the roll, and also making it  difficult to remove air during casting.  As a result, pin holes would be generated in the thermosetting resin outer layer.  Therefore, it is not preferable.<br>
Preferably, the lower limit of the content of the inorganic powder is at least 6 5 percent by weight, and more preferably, it should be at least 70 percent by weight.  The upper limit should preferably be at most 85 percent by weight, and more preferably, 8 0 percent by weight.<br>
If the average particle diameter of the inorganic powder is smaller than 0.05 um, the viscosity of the slurry-like mixture of thermosetting resin raw material and inorganic powder becomes too high, making it difficult to cast the thermosetting resin outer layer of the roll, and also making it difficult to remove air during casting.<br><br>
As a result, pin holes would be generated in the thermosetting resin outer layer.  Therefore, it is not preferable.  Further, if the average particle diameter of the inorganic powder exceeds 50.0 ^m,   smoothness of the roll surface is degraded, and hence it is not preferable.<br>
Preferably, the lower limit of average particle diameter of the inorganic powder should be at least 0.1 µm and more preferably, at least 0.3µm.      The upper limit should preferably be at most 30 µm  and, more preferably at most 10 µm.<br>
The thickness of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer filled with high percentage content of inorganic powder should preferably be at least 0.5 mm, and more preferably, at least 1.0 mm.<br>
Here, if the thickness of surface portion filled with high content of inorganic powder of the thermosetting resin outer layer is smaller than 0.5 mm, the nip portion would be influenced by the inner thermosetting resin layer which has lower hardness, and hence it is not preferable. Though there is not a specific upper limit in the thickness of the surface portion filled with high content of inorganic powder of the outer layer, the thickness at most 20 mm may be appropriate.<br>
Further, in the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
the hardness of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer is not smaller than 95° and smaller than 100° in terms of shore D hardness.<br>
If the hardness of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer is smaller than 95° in terms of shore D hardness, the nip width becomes,too large to provide satisfactory pressure per unit area.  The hardness should preferably be at least 96° .  Strictly speaking, it is not possible to have the hardness of 100° . However, the hardness should desirably be as close as 100° .<br>
In the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium is in accordance with the present invention, generally, surface roughness (Ra) at the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer is in the range of not more than 0.5 µm, preferably not more than 0.2 µm  and desirably, not more than 0.1 µm.     Here, the surface roughness (Ra) means the arithmetical mean roughness (Ra) defined by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) B0601.  The surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer should be as smooth as possible. However, in practice, it is difficult to make the surface roughness (Ra) at the surface portion of the resin outer layer to be smaller than 0.01 µm.      If the surface roughness (Ra) at the surface portion of the thermosetting<br><br>
resin outer layer exceeds 0.5 µm,   the smoothness of the roll surface is degraded, making it impossible to make smooth the surface of the magnetic recording medium. Therefore, it is not preferable.<br>
The resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention is further provided with a fiber-reinforced lower winding layer<br>
 formed of a fiber material impregnated with a thermosetting resin on an outer peripheral surface of the metal roll core.  The fiber-reinforced lower winding layer is formed by a fiber material impregnated with a thermosetting resin around the metal roll core.<br>
The fiber material to be used may be made of an inorganic fiber or an organic fiber.  It is desirable to use an inorganic fiber such as glass fiber, carbon fiber or metal fiber, which is hard, has high ability of elastic recovery, exhibits good adhesion to resins and exhibits high fastening force.  Also usable is an organic fiber such as polyamide fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, polyimide fiber, polyester fiber, phenolic fiber or acrylic fiber.<br>
The fiber material is in the form of a yarn, roving, cloth tape or the like.  In view of strength of the roll obtained, it is desirable to use the cloth tape or the<br>
•roving and cloth tape in combination.<br><br>
Examples of the thermosetting resins for impregnating the fiber material are epoxy resin, unsaturated polyester resin, diallylphthalate resin, polyurethane resin and the like.  Such thermosetting resins include both thermosetting-type resin and cold setting-type resin.<br>
A filler in the form of inorganic powder such as quartz, glass beads, hydrated alumina, clay powder, silica powder or calcium carbonate may be used as admixed with the thermosetting resin.  The average particle diameter of the inorganic powder should be form 1 to 200 µm,   and preferably from 5 to 100 µrn.      Here, powder having the average particle diameter of smaller than 1 µm is not readily available, leading to higher cost.  Therefore, it is not preferred.  Further, if it exceeds 200 µm, uniform dispersion in resin becomes difficult.<br>
A non-woven fabric is also usable for the lower winding layer.  For example, on an outer peripheral surface portion of the aforementioned cloth tape or of the roving and cloth tape impregnated with filler-contained thermosetting resin, a layer of a non-woven fabric which is similarly impregnated with filler-mixed thermosetting resin may be wound around to be fitted over and joined together, to serve as the lower winding layer.<br>
Such a non-woven fabric has the excellent function of holding the inorganic material as uniformly incorporated<br><br>
therein in its entirety.  The non-woven fabric to be used is made of an organic fiber such as acrylic fiber, polyester fiber or phenolic fiber, or an inorganic fiber such as glass fiber or metal fiber.  Preferably, the non-woven fabric is in the form of a tape.<br>
The lower winding layer is 1 to 50 mm in overall thickness.  If less than 1 mm in thickness, the layer is insufficient in strength, exerts a smaller fastening force on the roll core, and therefore it is not suitable to use. On the other hand, if the thickness exceeds 50 mm, the layer will not have correspondingly increased strength but becomes more costly, and therefore it is undesirable.  In view of the strength of the roll, the fastening force of the roll core and the like, the thickness of the lower winding layer is preferably in the range of 2 to 15 mm.<br>
In this manner, the lower winding layer formed on the outer peripheral surface of the roll core is positioned between the roll core and the thermosetting resin outer layer and has a function of realizing good fitting and joining of these two and it also has a function of preventing separation from the roll core as it reinforces the fastening force to the roll core.<br>
The above described objects of the present invention can be attained by the method of manufacturing a resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in which<br><br>
a slurry-like mixture of thermosetting resin raw material and an inorganic powder having the average particle diameter of from 0.05 to 50.0 µm  is cast to a cylindrical mold for rotational casting, an outer layer hollow cylinder of the thermosetting resin containing at its surface portion the inorganic powder at the content of 60 to 95 percent by weight is formed by rotational casting, a metal roll core is fitted in the outer layer hollow Cylinder, and the roll core and the outer layer hollow cylinder are fitted and joined together.<br>
Here, preferably, an adhesive is injected to annular clearance between the metal roll core and the outer layer hollow cylinder and the adhesive is cured so that the roll core and the outer layer hollow cylinder are  bonded together by the adhesive layer.<br>
Preferably, the method of manufacturing a resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention includes the step of forming a fiber-reinforced lower winding layer formed of the aforementioned fiber material impregnated with the thermosetting resin on an outer peripheral surface of the metal roll core.<br>
The method of manufacturing the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention will be described with reference to<br><br>
the figures.<br>
First, as shown in Fig. 1, a fiber material impregnated with the thermosetting resin is wound to a prescribed thickness on an outer peripheral surface of a metal roll core (1), thus forming a fiber-reinforced lower winding layer (2),  The metal roll core (1) is formed on a metal such as stainless steel, and it is desirable to make the outer periphery thereof rough-surfaced by sandblasting or by forming a multiplicity of helical grooves, since the rough-surface promotes tight joining of the roll core (1) and the lower winding layer (2).<br>
Separate from the above, an outer layer hollow :ylinder (3) of a thermosetting resin shown in Fig. 2 is arepared.  This is formed by casting a slurry-like mixture 3f the thermosetting resin raw material and an inorganic powder having average particle diameter of 0.05 to 50.0 µm to  a cylindrical mold for rotational casting, performing rotational casting so that the surface portion (3a) comes •o contain the inorganic powder at a prescribed content, .nd curing the thermosetting resin at a prescribed emperature.  Thus, the outer layer hollow cylinder (3) of he thermosetting resin is formed.<br>
The curing temperature of the thermosetting resin is etermined dependent on the type of the resin used.  If he resin is thermo-setting type one, the curing<br><br>
temperature is generally from 100 to 300°C, and if the resin is cold-setting type one, reaction and curing takes place at a room temperature.<br>
In this manner, by rotational casting, the thermosetting resin outer layer (3) containing at its surface portion (3a) the inorganic powder at a prescribed ratio having superior surface smoothness, high surface hardness, superior compression strength and heat resistance and being free of pin holes can be obtained. Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 3, the thermosetting resin outer layer (3) is fitted around the metal roll core (1) having the fiber-reinforced lower winding layer (2), an adhesive is injected to annular clearance formed between the lower winding layer (2) and the outer layer hollow cylinder (3), the adhesive is cured at a prescribed temperature, fiber-reinforced lower winding layer (2) and the outer layer hollow cylinder (3) are fitted and bonded together by the adhesive layer (4), and thus the resin roll (5) for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention is manufactured.<br>
Examples of usable adhesives are those of epoxy resin type, unsaturated polyester resin type, diallylphthalate resin type or the like, in view of heat resistance, pressure resistance and so on.<br>
The adhesive is cured at a temperature usually of 20<br><br>
to 150°C.  It is especially desirable to set the curing temperature of the adhesive to be approximately the same as the surface temperature of the resin roll (5) for calendering a magnetic recording medium during use.. The reason for this is that this eliminates the residual stress of the thermosetting resin outer layer (3) when the resin roll (5) is in use, rendering the thermosetting resin outer layer (3) more resistant to breaking even when subjected to high pressure.<br>
In the resin roll for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention described above, the surface porion of the thermosetting resin outer layer has high storage elastic modulus (E') from 5 X 10"' to 5 x 10^^ dyn/cm2 at a temperature from 50 to 150°C with the frequency of 10 hertz (Hz), and the value of the expression (1 - p^)/E'   representing the relation between the storage elastic modulus (E') and Poisson's ratio (V )   has a value as low as<br>
2 X 10-11 cm2/dyn 
 <br>

[Inventive Example 1]<br>
The resin roll (5) for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with the present invention shown in  Fig. 3 was prepared by the following method.<br>
First, as shown in Fig. 1, an iron roll core (1)<br><br>
having a length of 1200 mm, surface length of 550 mm and outer diameter of 300 mm was rough-surfaced over the outer periphery by sandblasting, and a fiber material impregnated with epoxy resin was wound around the outer periphery of the roll core (1) to form a fiber-reinforced lower winding layer (2) having the thickness of 4 mm.  The fiber-reinforced lower winding layer (2) was formed by winding a glass cloth tape impregnated with epoxy rfesin mixed with silica powder on a peripheral surface of roll core (1), and thereafter winding a glass roving impregnated with the similar epoxy resin of the outer periphery of the tape layer.

The resin roll (5) had the outer diameter of 335 mm and the surface length of 400 mm.<br>
Performance Evaluation Test<br>
In order to evaluate the performance of the resin rolls (5) for calendering a magnetic recording medium in accordance with Inventive Examples 1 and 2 above, small sized rolls for performance evaluation were manufactured using the same material and substantially the same conditions for respective rolls.  Here, the iron roll core (1) had the size of the outer diameter of 192 mm, the surface length of 290 mm and the length of 760 mm, and the■ manufactured small resin roll (5) had the outer diai^eter<br><br>
of 230 nun and effective surface length of 230 mm.<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
For comparison, a small sized roll having the same size as above was manufactured by using the same material .and in the same manner as Inventive Example 2 above except that silica powder was not introduced.<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
An iron roll core and a fiber reinforced lower winding layer similar to those of Inventive Example 1 were prepared, the roll core having the lower winding layer was set vertically in a mold for casting having a prescribed size, a mixture including an epoxy resin raw material consisting of 100 parts by weight of resin and 52 parts by weight of a hardener mixed with 79 parts by weight of silica powder having average particle diameter of 10.0 //m was directly injected on the outer side of the iron roll<br>
&gt;<br>
core and cured, the roll outer periphery was cut and polished, thus a small sized roll for comparison test having the same size as described above was manufactured.<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
An iron roll core and a fiber-reinforced lower winding layer similar to those of Inventive Example 1 were prepared.  The roll core with lower winding layer was set vertically in a mold for casting having a prescribed size, a mixture including an epoxy resin raw material consisting<br><br>
of 100 parts by weight of resin and 65 parts by weight of a hardener mixed with 50 parts by weight of silica powder having average particle diameter of 10.0 ^m was directly cast to the outside of the iron roll core in the mold and cured, the roll outer periphery was cut and polished, and thus a small sized roll for comparison test having the same size as described above was manufactured.<br>
The relation between temperature and storage elastic modulus (E') of the surface portion of the thermosetting resin outer layer of each of the small sized test rolls in accordance with Inventive Examples 1 and 2 and the Comparative Examples 1 to 3 at the frequency of 10 Hz was measured by a viscoelastic spectrometer (manufactured by IWAMOTO SEISAKUSHO CO.,   LTD).  The results obtained are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and the graph of Fig. 4.<br>
Poisson's ratio (y) at the surface portion of each roll was measured in accordance with JIS K7054, and based on the measured values and the measured results of the aforementioned storage elastic modulus (E'), the value of the expression (1 - v   )/E'   representing the relation between storage elastic modulus (E') and Poisson'^s ratio (p)   related to Hertz's equation representing the nip width at each temperature was calculated.  The obtained results are as shown in Tables 1 and 2 and the graph of Fig. 5.<br>
Thereafter, the content of silica powder at the<br><br>
surface portion of the epoxy resin outer layer or the cross linked polyesteramide resin outer layer of the small sized test rolls were measured.  The measurement of the content of silica powder was performed by taking a sample piece having the thickness of 1 mm from the surface portion of the resin outer layer of each of the small sized test rolls, and ash content measurement of each sample piece was performed.  A thermo<br>
gravimetry/differential thermal analyzer (manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc.) was used for measurement.  The obtained results are as shown in Table 1.<br>
The hardness at the surface portion of the resin outer layer of each of the small sized test rolls was measured by a shore durometer (D type), and the surface roughness (Ra) at the surface portion of the resin outer layer was measured by using the surface texture measuring apparatus (manufactured by Tokyo Seimitsu).  The obtained results are also shown in Table 1.<br>
Further, nip widths of the small sized test rolls in accordance with Inventive Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 for performance evaluation test were measured.<br>
The measurement of the nip widths was performed in the following manner.  A steel roll having the outer diameter of 202 mm and effective surface length of 230 mm<br><br>
was brought into contact with each roll, and aluminum foil (not shown) 15 µm in thickness was inserted between both rolls, three different loads of 100 kg/cm, 200 kg/cm and 300 kg/cm were applied between both rolls, and the widths of nipping trace transferred onto the aluminum foil were measured.  The measurement was performed with the roll surface temperature of 50°C.  The obtained results are as shown in the graph of Fig. 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As is apparent from Tables 1 and 2 and from the graph of Fig. 4, the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to Inventive Examples 1 and 2 exhibited as high storage elastic modulus (E') as 1.24 x lO11 to 1.08 x 1011 dyn/cm2 and 6.30 x 1010 to 5.21 x 1010 dyn/cm2 at a temperature of 50 to 150°C, while the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to Comparative Examples 1<br>
. to 3 exhibited the storage elastic modulus as low as 3.77 x 10 to 2.90 X 1010 dyn/cm2, 4,01 x 10 to 3.01 x 10 dyn/cm2 and 3.41 x lO10 to 9.44 x 1010 dyn/cm2, respectively.  Especially, the small sized resin roll for testing corresponding to Inventive Example 1 exhibited as high the storage elastic modulus (E') as 1.01 x lO11 dyn/cm2 at 180°C, and as high as 8.53 x lO10 dyn/cm2 was maintained even at 200°C.<br>
As is apparent from Tables 1 and 2 and from the graph of Fig. 5, the value of the expression (1 - v2)/E' representing the relation between storage elastic modulus (E') and Poisson's ratio (v)   in relation to Hertz's equation representing the nip width was as low as 7.36 x 10-12 to 8.45 x 10-11 cm2/dyn and 1.43 x 10-11 to 1.73 x 10-11 cm2/dyn at a temperature range of 50 to 150°, respectively, for the small sized resin rolls for testing<br>
 corresponding to Inventive Examples 1 and 2.  The values<br><br>
for the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to the Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were as high ,as 2.23 x 10-11 to 2.90 X 10-11 cm2/dyn, 2.17 x 10-11 to 2.89 x 10-11 cm2/dyn and 2.53 x 10-11 to 9.15 x 10-11 cm2/dyn, respectively.  Further, the small sized resin roll for testing corresponding to Inventive Example 2 exhibited the value as low as 1.91 x lO-11 cm2/dyn at 180°C.  The small sized resin roll for testing corresponding to Inventive Example 1 exhibited the low value of 9.04 x lO"'-'-'^ cm2/dyn at 180°C, and even at 200°C, it exhibited the low value of 1.07 X 10"  cm /dyn.  Further, as shown in the graph of Fig. 6, the smaller the value of the expression (1 - v2' )/E', the smaller the nip width.<br>
As compared with the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to Comparative Examples 1 to. 3, the content of silica powder at the surface portion of the resin outer layer of the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to Inventive Examples 1 and 2 were higher and shore D hardness of the rolls corresponding to Inventive Examples were also higher.<br>
As for the surface roughness (Ra) at the surface portion of the resin outer layer of the roll, the surface roughness of the small sized resin rolls for testing corresponding to Inventive Examples 1 and 2 were smaller as compared with the small sized resin rolls for testing<br><br>
corresponding to Comparative Examples 2 and 3 containing .<br>
silica powder.  That is, the rolls corresponding to<br>
Inventive Examples had superior surface smoothness.<br>
Especially, the small sized resin roll for testing<br>
corresponding to Inventive Example 1 used fine inorganic<br>
powder having smaller average particle diameter, and hence<br>
the surface roughness was at the same level as that of<br>
Comparative Example 1 which was not filled with inorganic<br>
powder.<br>
As shown in the graph of Fig. 6, when the small sized<br>
resin rolls for testing corresponding to Inventive<br>
Examples were each brought into contact with the steel<br>
roll and subjected to a load, smaller nip width can be<br>
obtained and accordingly, substantially larger pressure<br>
per unit area can be obtained.  This is the same when the<br>
roll has the size of the machine actually in operation.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to make smooth the surface of a<br>
magnetic recording medium and to surely perform process to<br>
* increase density of magnetic layer or the like by passing<br>
the magnetic recording medium between the resin roll for<br>
calendering magnetic recording medium in accordance with<br>
thia present invention and a steel roll while applying a<br>
high nip pressure.<br>
