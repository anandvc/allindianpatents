				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 3. *        Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relatesj to a cover for connecting sockets for r€!ceiving pipelines such as flow pipes and return pipes of oiJ. burn'=irs of a furnace as well as a filling level iridicc.ror, ,:. suction pump, an aerating and venting valve, or like oper.Hiting devices. Such connecting sockets are arranged at: the top of the storage container for liquids ' that are^ in P:i.rticular, combustible liquids such as heating oil.<br>
2 -   D^rscrxption of the Related Art<br>
The manufacture of such covers that are preferably used i;::, connection with outdoor heating oil storage tanks and are iru;:.nufactured of sheet metal, is expensive-<br><br>
S^JMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It 1:3 an object of the present invention to further d-^velop tlie cover for storage containers of the af'oreiT.entioned kind with regard to an optimal protection arainst ptanstration of tcvoistnre as well as with regard to an imsxpensive manufacture*<br>
In accordance with the present invesntion, thii3 is achieved in that the divided cover, marvufactured of plastic iu:,rerial^ cciuprisejs a stationary cover part, connected to the rim of the l:op of the storage contain^ir, and a pivotable c:^ver part connected to the stationary cover part/ wherein t::e pivot.sJols cover part in a closed position .rests? with a closvire rim against the rim of the top of the storage container and with a cover riin, that surrounds the end face Q'::eni:ag of the pivotable cover part and extends in a plane t^nat is slanted relative to the closure rim in a closino direction o-f the pivotable cover part. The cover rim covers t&gt;!.e opening rim of the end face opening of the stationary cover par": and surrounds in the open position the ^&gt;tationary c::ver par*: at a clearance and is supported therecn.<br><br>
The invention is fur^ihermore cha.racteri2ed ir. regard to ti:e rtLEauliod by the steps of deep drawing a cover body from a p.last:.c sheet matsrial/ subsequently separating the deep drawing edg?* from the cover body by a cut parallel to the<br>
plane of t:he sheet material, as well a* separating the cover body into a first cover part that is to be fixedly connecte;d to thfc^i ri.ni of the top of the strorage container and a second cover part that is to be pivotably connected uo the first CDVer part, cutting out a segment frort*. the  cover body by nis-ans of two additional cuts, wherein the first cut is C;.rrx'£d ouc perpendicularly^ or approximately^ P'r-rpendicularly, to the lower edge of the cover body at the i.;-ner sidf2 of the drainage groove and this second cut, bf:'ginning at the lower edge of the cover body, extends at a slant to the first cut through the cover body-<br><br>

Fig. 6 shows in a yide view the cover body made by deep drawing fron a plastic sheet iriaterial illustrating the course 01 the cut for separating "the cover body into two cover parts.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The patra-llelapipedai stox-age container 1, made of sheet metal, providt^d for liquids, in particular, corabustible liquids like heating oil, used oil, lubricant oil, and diesel f jel, has a bottorr: 2, four sidewalls 3-6 connected by rounded corner ar^^as 7 to one another, a top 8 with a connecting socket 9 f.c2: the feed conduit 10 and a connecting socket 11 f(,)r the restarn conduit 12 of the oil burner of a furnace, a connecting ^socket 13 for inserting a filling level indicator as  well as a connecting socket 14 for an aerating and venting v-alve, and ;= cover 15 for the connecting sockets 9, 11, 13, 14; ar..d tha various operating devices.<br>
The divided cover 15 made of plascic material is ccraprised of a star.ionary cover part 17 mounted on the rim 16 o:: the top 8 of the storage container 1 and a cover part 18 connected to the cover part 17 so as to be pivotable relative to th^^ cover part 17.  In the closed position 18a, the piv'otable cover part 18 rests with a closure rim 19 against zhB  rim l6 ot  the top 8 cf the storage container and covers wi::h its cover rim 20, that surrounds, an end face opening 21 of the cover part 18 and extends in a plane 22-22 positioned at a slant relative to the closure rim 19, the opening rim 23 of the end face opening 24 of the stationary cover part 17.<br><br>
In. th(5 open position 19b^ the pivotable cover part 18 covers tie s':3tioriei:y cover part 17 at a clearance and is supported with  -ihe end face 25 on a projection 26 of the stationary cover part 17. A drainage groove 27. is formed in the opening rim 2:3 of the end face opening 24 of the stationary cover part 17; by means of the groove 27^ rainwater or melted snow that has e?;ntarad the gap 28 between pivctable and stationary cover parts 17, 18 can drain to the e:'Cterior.<br>
'.:h^  atcitionary and the pivotable cover parts 17, 18 of t!ie cover IJ5 have a lower cover riia 29, 30, respectively. The cover rims 29, 30 surround the rim 16 of the top 8 of the ■ s™orage container 1.  The pivotable cover 18 has in the area of thtj lov^er cover rim 30 a formed portion 31 that, in the closed po£5ition 13a of the pivotable cover part/ forms betwe€in the lower cover rim 30 and the rim 15 of the top 8 of the storage container 1 a through opening 32 for the feed and return conduits 10/ 12 of the oil burner of a furnace that are connected to the connecting sockets 10, 11 of the storage container 1.<br>
The pivotable cover 13 has a recessed portion 33 for r-:^ceiving a handle 34 for opening and closing the cover 15. Trie handle 3 4 is made of a pipe section 35 •<br><br>
In place of  the handle in the foriu of a pipe Ejection, on t:nj5 pivot.ii,ble cover part a lock for locking the cover can be provided. The lock can be configured as a handle for opening a:rid closing the cover.<br>
E'or manufacturing the cover/ the cover body 3v5 illustrated in Fig- 6 is deep drawn of plastic sheet material 3"^ By rr.acnis of a cut 39-59 parallel to the plane 40-40 of tt'-e sheet material 37, first the deep drav/ing edge 38 is sc-,:par5.ted from the cover body 36, Subsequently^ the cover b:.'dy 3 6 i,=; divided into a first cover part 17 that is T:O be fixedly attached to the rim IS of the top 3 of the storage container 1 and a .second cover part 18 that is to be pivots.bly connected to the first cover part 17,  Separating the cover body 56 into the two cover parts 17, 18 is realised by cutting out a segment 41 of the cover body with two additional cuts 42-42, 43-43, wherein the first cut 42-42 extends perpendicularly, or substantially perpendicularly, to the lower edge 44 of the cover body 36 at the inner side 45 of the; dr^dnage groove 27 and the second cut 43-43 extends, beginr.ing at the lower edge 44 of the cover body 36, at a slant to the first cut 42-42 through the cover body 36.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
