The present invention concerns a heat exchanger with a connection that connects an uncooled pipe to several cooled pipes as recited in the preamble to Claim 1.<br>
Heat-exchanger connections wherein the heat-insulated end of a hot and uncooled pipe bifurcates outward are known (German Patent 3910630) . The connection conveys the hot gas into a single pipe that is cooled from outside, by boiling water for example. The principle has been proven. Still, it is considered more or less of a drawback that the cooled pipe must be relatively long because of its considerable width, approximately the same as that of the uncooled pipe. This is because of the thermodynamics involved in cooling the gas to a specific desired temperature*<br>
The cooled pipe can be considerably shorter and the heat exchanger accordingly more cost effective when the hot fluid from the single uncooled pipe is distributed to several cooled pipes. Designs of this genus are known wherein hot fluid deriving from an intake is distributed by way of an intake chamber to a number of cooled pipes secured in s single floor. There is, however, a drawback to this system in that the fluid becomes turbulent as it reaches the floor and tends to erode it.<br><br>
US Patent 5464057 discloses a heat exchange^ of doubled-walled pipe that communicates with a header in the fox_ ^. u pipe with an elliptical cross-section* There is an intake "at the end of the heat exchanger where the gas enters. The intake accommodates several gas channels, each communicating with a gas-supply pipe. Each gas channel tapers out downstream and distributes the hot incoming gas to several cooled pipes. Drawbacks to this heat exchanger are its extreme length and that each cooled pipe requires a separate jacket to accommodate the coolant. Furthermore, the intake is complicated and accordingly expensive.<br>
Another known heat exchanger of double-walled pipe employs a connection in the form of a siphon pipe that branches into two or three legs with no change in the overall cross-section. Each leg is assigned to one of the double-walled pipes. This heat exchanger has basically, the same drawbacks as the one described in US Patent 5464057.<br>
The object of the present invention is accordingly a heat exchanger of the aforesaid genus that will distribute hot fluid from an uncooled pipe to several cooled pipes by way of a simple, cost-effective, and compact and space-saving connection without the floor being subjected to turbulence from the direct impact of the fluid*<br>
This object is attained in accordance with the present invention in a heat exchanger of the aforesaid genus<br><br>
*<br>
as recited in the body of Claim 1. Advantageous advanced embodiments are addressed by the subsidiary claims.<br>
Distributing the gas-conveying channels and their associated cooled pipes over the smallest possible containable area allows the channels to be provided with a single and preferably cylindrical jacket. The cooled pipes can also extend through a single outer jacket. The heat exchanger can accordingly be space-saving, cylindrical, and cost-effective.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention will now be specified with reference to the attached drawing, wherein<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through the bottom of a heat exchanger and connection and<br>
F.igure 2 is a top view of the connection, The only partly illustrated heat exchanger 1 is employed to cool a hot gas using a coolant, preferably boiling water. The gas has preferably been cracked in a cracking furnace and needs to be rapidly cooled. The gas leaves the cracker through at least one uncooled pipe 2, each of which communicates with heat exchanger 1 through a connection 3 -<br>
Heat exchanger 1 comprises several, four for instance, cooled pipes 4, each with an inside diameter shorter than that of the uncooled pipe. Cooled pipes 4 are distributed in a circle, enclosed in a cylindrical outer<br><br>
jacket 5, and welded to a floor 6. Cooled pipes 4 extend through'a coolant intake chamber 7 that rests on and is welded to floor 6 with its other end welded to outer jacket 5. At the other, unillustrated, end of heat exchanger 1 cooled pipes 4 are secured to another floor and enclosed in a coolant-outlet chamber.<br>
Connection 3 has a cylindrical intake section 8 of the same inside diameter as that of uncooled pipe 2, to which it is secured, welded for example- Intake section 8 tapers out into a cylindrical terminating section 9.<br>
The intake section 8 of connection 3 branches into several gas-conveying channels 10 arrayed in the shape of a star and accommodated in terminating section 9, each channel communicating coaocially with a cooled pipe 4 and distributed at the same points around the circle. The inside diameter of each cooled pipe 4 is as long as or longer than that of each gas-conveying channel 10.<br>
Terminating section 9 is welded to the floor 6 that cooled pipes 4 rest on. A gap has been left between the adjacent faces of gas-conveying channels 10 and cooled pipes 4 to allow expansion subject to heat-<br>
The space between gas-conveying channels 10 and terminating section 9 is packed with heat insulation. Connection 3 can be either cost-effectively cast in one<br><br>
piece from a metallic and-heat-resistant material or welded together from several parts.The connection 3 specified herein will convey the hot gas to cooled pipes 4 with little turbulence. The matching inside diameters and outer contours of gas-conveying channels 10 and cooled pipes 4 will prevent the gas from becoming turbulent, and floor 6 will not be subject to wear*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
