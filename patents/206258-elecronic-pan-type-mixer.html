PAN TYPE CONCRETE MIXER<br><br>
RAKESK &amp; ASSOCIATES a Partnership Firm Registered in India<br>
having its registered office at 105, STANFORD PLAZA,<br>
OSHIWARA, LINK ROAD, ANDHERI (W) MUMBAI, PIN-400 053,<br>
AN INDIAN PARTNERSHIP FIRM<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which the same is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pan type concrete mixer , particularly electronically controlled pan type concrete mixer which is useful in mixing particularly, but not exclusively, Ready Mix Concrete herein after called RMC grade concrete by using either cement or cement with an admixer , and for using fly ash in making concrete.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known in the art, Concrete mixers having tilt-able mixing drums which are basically hollow, cylindrical in shape and are provided with a tapered constriction, such drums requiring different filling, mixing and discharge positions with regard to their axis of rotation. Mixing drum are also known which likewise use the free-fall mixing action but in which the filling and mixing positions are identical, and in this case the mixing drum, with the mixing tools mounted in its interior, rotates substantially about a horizontal axis. But this drum mixers are not useful in getting high quality concrete because there the mixing is not forced mixing but gravitv dependant.<br>
Furthermore, Pan mixers are used for mixing concrete or aggregates for concrete or other mixtures required in large batches. Normally, the pan rotates and mixing blades which are suspended above the pan eccentrically dip into the material in the pan and serve to turn it over and mix it. The blades may take the form of fixed ploughs or of blades mounted rotatably upon a head. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that the pan is a cumbrous element for rotation and discharge of the material commonly has to be accomplished by a sloping plough blade which is intended to discharge the material over the lid of the pan and discharge is usually not complete or rapid.<br>
Attempts to use rotary arms with a stationary pan have resulted in complex constructions on account of the necessity that the center of rotation of the arms must not coincide with the axis of the pan or the material would not be stirred properly, and on the other hand if the axis is eccentric to the pan, the axis must move about if all parts of the pan are to be reached.<br>
Pan mixers with rotating scraper blades are also known. But while using fly ash as a substitute for cement which is cheaply available compared to cement and is inactive material unlike cement. The fly is normally finer<br><br><br>
than cement and must be triturated thoroughly to get the initiation to act like cement. For dosing of admixers and flyash which is very light in nature and connect be mixed in any drum type mixers, since during mixing of concrete with flyash, due to the lightness of the flyash it gets stuck to the outer periphery of the drum and the dosing is wasted.<br>
The consistency of concrete depends upon the proportions of aggregates, cement and water used, and although it is usual in the preparation of high grade concrete to weigh the various aggregates and the cement, and to weigh or measure volumetrically the water, it is very difficult, as anyone who has had experience of concrete mixing will recognize, to obtain the correct consistency of the concrete mix. This is due to the variable quantity of water present in the aggregates, particularly the fine aggregate or sand, unless these are dried beforehand, which is a very expensive operation.        '<br>
The applicant now invented a concrete mixer with a simplified construction in which the material in the pan is thoroughly stirred , getting a rubbing action when fly ash is used, electronically controlled water batching and aggregate loading to ensure the concrete quality , and the operations , including the operation of discharge, are thorough and very rapid.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention is to provide RMC quality mix within seconds, as the mixing time in the present invention is only 30 Seconds, and there by reducing the operating cost.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a forced type of mixing, and thereby certain quantities of cement can also be saved to get the similar strength while retaining the good quality of concrete. Yet another object is to use Admixers to get a good quality mix which could give all the advantages of using an Admixer while providing consistency in mixing.<br>
Yet another object of the invention to make use of flyash, which is now been propagated in the industry giving the distinct advantage to the Contractors of using flyash, in lieu of certain quantities of cement, thereby reducing the cost of concrete.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the mixing time greatly thereby smaller capacity mixer can give much higher output and to reduce the total power consumption of a given capacity of the mixer.<br><br><br>
Yet another object is to provide mixer which delivers high quality consistent concrete ideal for mixing stiff mixes for interlock tiles, hollow blocks, precast members, etc, where mix quality is of utmost importance, and to get a required strength of a block or tile<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a pan mixer with electronic weighing &amp; water batching systems there by avoid the requirement of separate arrangement for weighing aggregates &amp; water batching<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention a concrete mixer particularly but not exclusively to make use of fly ash and admixers which is essentially of pan type comprises, a cylindrical outer frame to form the sides of the pan, a flat base made of steel and a wear plate attached on the base, a centrally mounted shaft in which the mixing arms are attached, the shaft are driven through a geared motor, a housing assembly for the shaft to prevent the wear and tear to the shaft, having mixing blade attached on the ends of the mixing arms with the help of pads, mixing arms are positioned in such a manner to get maximum mixing action through out the periphery of the pan, an aggregate weighing system, a water batching system and a hopper for loading aggregates with gates optionally hydraulically operated to open and put the aggregates into the pan, and a cover containing opening for aggregates , water and an optional inspection gate.<br>

In accordance with the invention the use of special additives in concrete<br>
or substitutes for cement such as fly ash or reinforcing materials such as<br>
iron fibbers are   now made possible by use of these pan mixers. This<br>
achievements are particularly due to the simple construction and the<br>
different orientation of the mixing arms along with blades and the forced<br>
mixing effect it generates during mixing. Also the accurate dosing due to<br>
the additional features such as a load cell controlled weighing aggregate<br>
and water batching made it possible to get consistent mixing and<br>
