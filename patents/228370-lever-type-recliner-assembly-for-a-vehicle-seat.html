				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a lever type recliner assembly for a vehicle seat and<br>
for example a vehicle reclining seat for a seat occupant who, in particular, is the<br>
driver and/or co-driver of the vehicle.<br>
The seat recliners are basically used for giving maximum comfort to the<br>
driver and co-driver and to ensure that there is minimum fatigue levels even after<br>
prolonged hours of driving. The two types of recliners used in the art are Rotary<br>
type and lever type. The rotary type has an infinite adjustment in steps of 1 degree,<br>
2 degrees, or 3 degrees. The backward and forward movements in the rotary type is<br>
slower compared to in the lever type recliners. However it is observed that most of<br>
the manufacturers of cars in the world prefer the lever type recliners. Moreover it is<br>
a purpose of this invention to provide avehicle reclining seat with lever type<br>
recliner assembly.<br>
It may here now be mentioned that at present, all conventional vehicle<br>
reclining seat fitted with lever type recliner assembly, are all associated with<br>
various defects. In particular, occurrence of the squeaking noise in the recliner<br>
during its operations, lower life of coil spring, plate holder bending during staking<br>
operations thereby restricting the free movement of the arm recliner during<br>
operation, thus occupants tend to become disinclined to take advantage of the<br>
reclining arrangements.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a lever type<br>
recliner assembly for a vehicle seat, for a seat occupant who in particular is the<br>
driver and/or co-driver of the vehicle, is novel in its constructions and obviates all<br>
disadvantages and drawbacks associated with the conventional vehicle reclining<br>
seat fitted with lever type recliner assembly.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
vehicle reclining seat with lever type recliner, for a seat<br>
occupant who in particular is the driver and/or co-driver of the<br>
vehicle, which is easy to operate without any squeaking noise in<br>
the recliner during its operation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is . to provide a<br>
vehicle reclining "seat with lever type recliner, for a seat<br>
occupant who in particular is the driver and/or co-driver of the<br>
vehicle, where the life span of coil spring is much longer thereby<br>
increasing the reliability of the system.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
vehicle reclining seat with lever type recliner, for a seat<br>
occupant who in particular is the driver and/or co-driver of the<br>
vehicle which is stronger in its construction, light in its weight<br>
and cheaper in original costs.<br>
Keeping the above objects in mind, the present invention thus<br>
provides a vehicle reclining seat with lever type recliner, for a<br>
seat occupant who in particular is the driver and/or co-driver of<br>
the vehicle, comprising of a seat frame which includes a seat rest<br>
a back rest and a lever type recliner assembly arm recliner of<br>
which is mounted to the said backrest and plate base is mounted to<br>
the cushion frame of said seat rest, the entire seat frame is<br>
mounted on the vehicle under body wherein said lever type recliner<br>
assembly consists of a arm recliner held in between the plate base<br>
and plate holder by a pin stopper and is engaged with lower part<br>
with the help of teeth parts provided on each of them, said lower<br>
part in turn is held in a desired position by a cam lever held in<br>
between plate base and plate holder along with lever rod by a<br>
shaft cam, being activated by a lever release held with lever rod<br>
by a pin lever rod and operating against the spring lever tension.<br><br>
The said lever type recliner assembly of the present<br>
invention is made of special metal or the like non-rigid and<br>
resilient material, heat treatment cycle of which is established<br>
to achieve the required case depth, resulting in having soft core,<br>
tough teeth and ability to withstand impact load without failure.<br>
Moreover the assembly may be configured into any shape depending<br>
upon requirement and/or choice, but preferably in the shape of the<br>
seat frame.<br>
Unlike other known vehicle reclining seats, the vehicle<br>
reclining seat of the present invention can be operated far more<br>
easily and reliably than the existing ones.<br>
For a better understanding of the nature of this invention<br>
and to show how the same may be carried into effect (operated),<br>
reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig - 1: Shows the side view of the vehicle reclining seat with<br>
lever type recliner, for a seat occupant who in<br>
particular is the driver and/or co-driver of the<br>
vehicle according to the present invention.<br>
Fig - 2: Shows the side view of lever type recliner assembly of<br>
the vehicle reclining seat of the present invention.<br>
Fig - 3: Shows cross-sectional view along the line A-A of figure<br>
2 according to present invention.<br>
Fig - 4: Shows cross-sectional view along the line B-B of figure<br>
2 according to present invention.<br>
Fig - 5: Shows top-sectional view of figure 2 according to<br>
present invention.<br><br>
The attached drawings in which like reference characters<br>
represent like parts, are intended for a better understanding<br>
thereof. The embodiments shown are not intended to limit the<br>
invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
The description of the' invention made here under which now<br>
follows is made in relations to figures 1 to 4 wherein a vehicle<br>
reclining seat with lever type recliner, comprises of seat frame<br>
which includes a seat rest (1), a back rest (2) and a lever type<br>
recliner assembly (3) connecting both of them by arm recliner and<br>
plate base respectively. The said lever type recliner assembly<br>
consists of arm recliner (4), one end of which mounted to the said<br>
back rest and the other end is held in between the plate base (5)<br>
and plate holder (6) by a pin stopper (7) provided with a step (8)<br>
on it so as to eliminate the problem of plate holder bending<br>
during staking operation. The teeth of arm recliner and lower part<br>
(not shown in figure) are engaged wherein the first tooth on the<br>
arm recliner form the dwell profile and same is 0.2 mm higher than<br>
the maximum tooth height (not shown in figure) thereby eliminating<br>
the possible squeaking noise in the recliner during operation.<br>
Said lower part is held in a desired position (engagement or<br>
disengagement of lower tooth with the tooth of arm recliner) by a<br>
cam lever (9) held in between plate base (5) and plate holder (6)<br>
along with leyer rod_ (10) with the help of a shaft cam (11) with a<br>
step down (12) portion for lever rod. The said cam lever is<br>
actuable by lever release (13) held with lever rod (10) by a pin<br>
lever rod (14) spin rivetted and is operable against the spring<br>
lever (15) tension. The return spiral spring (16) is of size<br>
3.4 x 10 mm for increased life span of the spring.<br>
Now to show how the vehicle reclining seat with lever type<br>
recliner for a seat occupant who in particular is the driver<br><br>
and/or co-driver of the vehicle of the present invention may be<br>
carried into effect or function, reference is again made to figure<br>
1 and 2 wherein in normal condition teeth of arm recliner and<br>
lower part are engaged thereby keeping the backrest in locked<br>
condition. For angular adjustment of. the backrest for giving<br>
maximum comfort to the driver and co-driver after a long driving,<br>
the lever release is operated against the spring lever thereby<br>
allowing the cam lever to slide down along with the lower part,<br>
causing disengagement of lower tooth with arm recliner. Now the<br>
arm recliner could be adjusted to the desired position and by<br>
releasing lever release, the backrest gets locked at desired angle<br>
of comfort.<br>
Here it may be noted that the said arm recliner, lower tooth<br>
and cam lever are fine blanked so as to achieve flatness, higher<br>
dimensional accuracy on tooth profile area of arm recliner and<br>
lower tooth and profile area of cam lever.<br>
The invention having been described in detail in connection<br>
with the preferred embodiments, is to be taken as an example only,<br>
not to be restricted there to. It will be easily understand by<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art that other variations and<br>
modifications can be easily made within the scope of this<br>
invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
