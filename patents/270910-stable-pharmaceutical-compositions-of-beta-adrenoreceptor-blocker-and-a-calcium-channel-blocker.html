COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rule! 3)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Stable pharmaceutical compositions of beta adrenoreceptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker"<br>
2. APPLICANT (S) <br>
(a) NAME: IPCA LABORATORIES LIMITED<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: an Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS:   48, Kandivli Industrial Estate, Charkop, Kandivli (West) Mumbai - 400 067, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to stable dual release pharmaceutical compositions used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and chronic stable angina comprising a calcium channel blocker drug such as amlodipine and a synthetic beta-selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent such as metoprolol succinate in the form of an oral solid bilayered formulation and to a process for preparation thereof. The salt of metoprolol is provided with an extended release polymer base retardant coating and the salt of amlodipine either besylate or maleate is provided as an immediate release component.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Amlodipine besylate is long acting calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine besylate is chemically described as 3-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(2-aminoethoxymethyl)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-l,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate benzenesulfonate. Its empirical formula is C20H25CIN2O5●C6H6O3S. It inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles and hence useful in the treatment of angina and hypertension.<br>
Amlodipine besylate is commercially available as Norvasc (Pfizer) in the form of oral tablets in 2.5mg, 5mg and l0mg base preparations. The usual initial anti hypertensive oral dose of Amlodipine besylate is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile or elderly individuals or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding Amlodipine besylate to other hypertensive<br>
Amlodipine is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine is high in man corresponding to 97%. It is extensively converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism.<br>
US Patent Application No. 2003220312 describes co-administration or sequential administration of two compounds for treating a variety of circulatory disorders including<br>
2<br><br>
cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. The first compound is characterized by a steroid type nucleus with an epoxy moiety attached to the nucleus and having competitive aldosterone receptor binding activity. The second compound is a calcium channel blocker, preferably, amlodipine besylate.<br>
Amlodipine is used in combination with statin compounds. This synergistic combination is useful for treating subjects suffering from angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis, combined hypertension and hyperlipidemia and for subjects with symptoms of cardiac risk<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions of amlodipine and atorvastatin are described in patent CA2444554. The said patent also describes methods of preparing stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising atorvastatin and amlodipine, and a kit suitable for commercial sale.<br>
Metoprolol succinate is a beta-selective (cardioselective) adrenoreceptor blocking agent, for oral administration, available as extended release tablets to treat a heart condition called angina. Its chemical name is (±) l-(isopropylamino)-3-[p-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy]-2-propanol succinate (2:1) (salt). It reduces the oxygen demand to heart, slowing the heart rate, reducing cardiac output when at rest and on exercise and reduces systolic blood pressure. There have been controlled and sustained release metoprolol formulations already known which comprise of controlled release pellets, where each pellet acts as a separate drug delivery unit. But in order to obtain a desirable release of a drug, a considerable amount of experimentation needs to be done. So, in accordance with the present investigation, an extended release pharmaceutical formulation is devised to release the drug for upto 24 hours in a suitable controlled manner.<br>
EP 0293347 by Henry A. C. and Christina E. E. describes Metoprolol succinate as therapeutically active compound, and pharmaceutical preparation comprising it. The invention describes a core containing the therapeutically active compound, the core coated with a layer comprising an anionic polymer soluble, and a water insoluble polymer selected from the group of quaternary ammonium substituted acrylic polymers.<br>
3<br><br>
US Pat. No. 4871549 to Yoshio U et al., describes a time controlled explosion system comprising Metoprolol, a swelling agent such as a low substituted hydroxy propyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate or carboxy methyl cellulose sodium, coated with a water-insoluble coating material so that drug release is caused by the explosion of the membrane after a definite time period.<br>
EP1110542 by Mccall Troy W and Bachiwal Anand R describes once-a-day oral dosage form of Metoprolol to be released over a period of 24 hours in the gastrointestinal tract. The sustained release matrix comprised of heterosaccharide derivatives of xanthan gum.<br>
However, none of the above patents deal with combination of an anti-hypertensive such as a beta-selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent and calcium channel blocker wherein the adrenoreceptor blocking agent is suitably formulated for extended release while the calcium channel blocker is incorporated suitably for immediate release.<br>
Thus there exists a need to introduce stable, cost effective pharmaceutical compositions having an additive effect in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients comprising dual effect thereby providing rapid effect of Amlodipine and an extended release of Metoprolol for 24 hours release.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide stable dual release pharmaceutical compositions used for treatment of hypertension, chronic stable angina and other related cardiovascular diseases comprising combination of therapeutically effective amount of a synthetic beta-selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent Metoprolol succinate and a calcium channel blocking agent, Amlodipine either racemic or its enantiomer or its salts.<br>
Another object is to provide extended release of selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker by using monolithic matrix that is combination of hydrophobic (carbomer) and hydrophilic (hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose) polymers, in an effective manner in extended release layer and immediate release of calcium channel blocking agent, thus providing two drugs<br>
4<br><br>
combination therapy to have additive effect in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to reduce the dose of one of the active ingredient by extending the drug release over a period of time.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention discloses stable pharmaceutical compositions comprising two active ingredients, formulated in a single dosage form providing different release profiles comprising dual release drug absorption system (Duredas) technology. The compositions involves use of disintegrants, which helps the immediate release of drug comprising calcium channel blocking agent and the use of monolithic matrix technique for extended release of an adrenergic blocking agent. The monolithic matrix comprises a combination of hydrophobic polymer preferably carbomer and hydrophilic polymer preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, thereby facilitating extended release of adrenergic blocking agent, over a time period of up to 24 hours.<br>
The stable solid pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration comprises a calcium channel blocker such as Amlodipine and a synthetic adrenoreceptor blocking agent, such as Metoprolol succinate equivalent to Metoprolol tartarate; and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The amount of the said salts of Amlodipine is in range the of 2.5 tol5mg equivalent to Amlodipine free base and preferably 5mg and 2.5mg. The amount of Metoprolol succinate equivalent to Metoprolol tartarate is in the range of 12.5 mg to 200mg and preferably 50mg and 25mg. The compositions possess additive effect in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention describes stable dual release pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration that comprises a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker drug such as Amlodipine as an immediate release component and a synthetic beta-selective adrenoreceptor blocking agent such as Metoprolol succinate incorporated in an extended<br>
5<br><br>
release matrix using monolithic matrix technology, along with pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients.<br>
Monolithic matrix technique includes use of combination of hydrophobic such as carbomer and hydrophilic polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, thereby helps the extended release of drug over specific period of time. The drug is dispersed in a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic matrix resulting in the initial dissolution of matrix polymer and then diffusion of the dissolved drug through the pores of the matrix before release.<br>
The invention further describes a process for preparation of dual release pharmaceutical compositions comprising bilayered tablets of two active ingredients such as Amlodipine besylate and Metoprolol succinate, formulated in a single dosage form providing different release profile using dual drug release absorption system (Duredas). The invention describes immediate release Amlodipine besylate equivalent to amlodipine free base and Metoprolol succinate equivalent to Metoprolol tartarate as an extended release component. The two drugs in combination therapy possess additive effect in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.<br>
As described herein, "bilayer tablet" is a tablet which is made up of two or more distinct layers or discrete zones of granulation compressed together with the individual layers lying one on top of another. Bilayer tablets are generally prepared by compressing granules onto previously partially compressed granules.<br>

Bioavailability study is conducted of Metoprolol XL 50mg + Amlodipine 5 mg FDC manufactured by IPCA Laboratories Ltd. in comparison with, Seloken XL tablet containing Metoprolol XL 50mg manufactured by Astra Zenaca Pharma Ltd. and Amlogard tablet containing Amlodipine 5 mg manufactured by Pfizer in 12 healthy male, adult human volunteers under fasting condition in a randomized two-way complete crossover design. Values of Cmax, tmax, AUC o-t and AUC o-«&gt; were comparable for the Reference and the Test preparation in the fasting state.<br>
Metoprolol XL was detected in plasma from 0.5 hour to about 72 hours in Reference preparation and Test preparation. Peak plasma levels of Metoprolol XL with the Reference preparations were achieved between 5 to 12 hours and with the Test preparations they are achieved between 2 to 12 hours.<br>
The mean peak plasma levels of Metoprolol XL with Reference preparation, Seloken XL tablet on the study day ranged between 32-292 ng/ml while with Test preparation ranged between 30-301 ng/ml.<br>
18<br><br>
On the basis of comparison of the AUCo-t for Metoprolol XL after single dose administration, the relative bioavailability of the Test preparation of Metoprolol XL 50 mg was 102.87 % of that of the Reference preparation, Seloken XL tablet.<br>
Amlodipine was detected in plasma from 0.5 hour to about 96 hours in Reference preparation and Test preparation. Peak plasma levels of Amlodipine with the Reference preparations were achieved between 5 to 16 hours and with the Test preparations they are achieved between 5 to 12 hours.<br>
The mean peak plasma levels of Amlodipine with Reference preparation, on the study day ranged between 2.01-3.94 ng/ml, while with Test preparation ranged 2.48-4.67 ng/ml. On the  basis  of comparison  of the  AUCo-t  for Amlodipine  after  single  dose administration, the relative bioavailability of the Test preparation of Amlodipine 5 mg was 99.37 % of that of the Reference preparation.<br>
Conclusion: On the basis of pharmacokinetic parameters, it can be concluded that the Test preparation of Metoprolol XL 50mg + Amlodipine 5 mg FDC tablets manufactured by IPCA Laboratories Ltd. is bioequivalent with the Reference preparation, Seloken XL tablet containing Metoprolol XL 50mg manufactured by Astra Zenaca Pharma Ltd. and Amlogard tablet containing Amlodipine 5 mg manufactured by Pfizer.<br>
