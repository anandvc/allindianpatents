DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The invention relates to the field of mobile communications. More specifically, the invention describes a method for personalization of services provided by a communication network. User specific data comprising a list of keywords and the corresponding action sequences is stored in an application server. A user can send a message comprising a keyword to the application server. The application server will initiate the sequence of actions specified for the sent keyword according to the user profile. Since the user profiles are stored in the application server, the method is device/client independent. Further, the message comprising the keyword can be sent from any mobile or fixed device, not necessarily the user's own device, or even from a web portal.<br>
This invention is in general related to IMS and VOIP based Application Server providing a service to any users in IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) /VOIP network. As a part of the service users can configure in a personalized way to achieve multiple sequence of actions. Users have to configure with network a keyword and specific set of actions associated with the keyword to be performed. The configuration data will be stored part of the servers. User can trigger a message to  network to execute the operations/actions  associated with  the<br>
 <br>
configured Keyword.<br>
Users can configure certain actions like making a call to a one or more users / group, sending SMS/MMS/IM to one or more users, Inviting/creating a multimedia conference, multimedia content push, PTT, POC, sharing portal page, sharing scheduler / calendar, sending greetings, and fetching information from presence server/ location server and based on the information perform specific action.<br>
These actions can be triggered from the users mobile device by means of clicking a mapped key, voice activation, clicking a shortcut (to launch special application), recognizing a jerk/sudden impact in the mobile device, through web based portal / page. Upon triggering, a SIP MESSAGE / SMS (with keyword) is sent to the application server where the keyword identified to the mapped set of actions to be performed.<br>
Configuration / Management Of Key and Action with Application Server:<br>
Users can configure a key and multiple sequence of actions in a personalized way, through web interface logging into portal page. All these keys with actions will be saved with the XML data manipulation server. User can configure using the Client software to send SIP MESSAGE, which contains the key and single/multiple sequence of actions in a personalized way. The client software provides the user interface (Ul) and specialized software to accept the key and actions from the user, construct SIP MESSAGE with the information and send it to Server.<br>
GSM and CDMS based subscribers can configure the service key and single/multiple sequence of actions in a personalized way using SMS/MMS message. From the mobile device users have to construct the message (SMS/MMS) and forward it to SMS IW Server. SMS IW Server receives the SMS/MMS message and constructs the SIP MESSAGE with the contents from SMS/MMS. The SIP MESSAGE will be forwarded to the Application Server.<br>
 <br>
Appfication Server receives the message and for all the valid keys and actions, it will save with data manipulation server.<br>
Users can flexibly create/modify/remove the keys through commands in the messages sent to server.<br>
Activate/Invoke Key and Action with Application Server:<br>
User can invoke the key stored at server by several ways. Client running in Mobile device/ PDA / Laptop or any other type of device connected to access independent IMS network can initiate a SIP MESSAGE / SMS / MMS to invoke the key and action set stored at the application server. Key and action set can be invoked at the server by sending an SIP MESSAGE / SMS / MMS with the Key information in that. Application server decodes the SIP MESSAGE / SMS / MSM contents and start executing the actions configured at the server.<br>
Users can invoke the actions by sending the KEY through WEB interface by logging into Portal or generic web page and send an HTTP Message. The Client (can be any type of handheld / any type of mobile device / any type of PDA / Laptop) shall detect based on following conditions and triggers a KEY to server.<br>
•	Users can configure a key on client and pressing that key on client to send the key information to server. Once server receives the KEY it initiates the actions associated with the key.<br>
•	Users can configure a shortcut and once clicking the short cut on client to send the key information to server. Shortcut will initiate a client based software application to construct and send the key to server.   Once  server  receives  the   KEY  it  initiates  the  actions associated with the key.<br>
•	Users can configure a voice command on client. Once the voice command is invoked then it will send the key information to server. Once server receives the KEY it initiates the actions associated with the key.<br>
•	Users can configure a jerk/sudden impact in the mobile device to initiate sending the KEY to the server. Once the jerk/sudden impact<br>
 <br>
is invoked then client based software application detects the event, and it will send the key information to server. Once server receives the KEY it initiates the actions associated with the key. • Users can configure in the client device in any personalized way, which can send a KEY to server. Once server receives the KEY it initiates the actions associated with the key.<br>
