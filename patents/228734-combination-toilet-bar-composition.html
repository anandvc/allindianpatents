COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
COMBINATION TOILET BAR COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br><br>
COMBINATION TOILET BAR COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a toilet bar suitable for moisturizing and cleansing the human body, such as the skin <br>
5       and hair.  In particular, it relates to a toilet bar<br>
   composition that is mild to the skin and which also has a creamy lather.<br>
Combination toilet bars are well known.  However, the <br>
10      majority of them are very irritating to the skin due to the fact that they are soap based, have low levels of moisturizers, or some combination thereof.  Many prior art combination bars have been produced by using a co-surfactant along with some amount of free fatty acid to achieve a <br>
15     certain degree of mildness.<br>
The milder co-surfactants typically used along with the fatty acids provide a milder bar with creamy lather.  Such co-surfactants typically used in combination bars are mainly<br>
20     sodium cocoyl isethionate, alfa olefin sulfonate, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate or a similar type of synthetic surface active agent(s). The fatty acids often used as superfatting agents are mainly coco fatty acids or stearic/palmitic fatty acids. The fatty acids in combination bars or even superfatted bars<br>
25      have traditionally been used to generate the delta phase for improvement in lather and mush properties.  In superfatted bars, the superfatting agents that have proven especially effective are low titer fatty acids which although not wishing to be bound by this theory, are believed to form the<br>
i<br>
30     delta phase by their interaction with stearate/palmitate soaps.<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
It has been surprisingly found that a specific surfactant blend can be used as a co-surfactant along with a superfatting mixture of both low and high titer fatty<br>
5    components in the inventive combination bar.  At least one of the components of the co-surfactant mix is an amphoteric surfactant (s).  The ratio of the non soap (synthetic) anionic to amphoteric surfactants can vary from 1:5 to 5:1, and the preferred total level of the co-surfactants is from<br>
10   2 % to 5 %.  The preferred anionic surfactant is selected from the group of C8-18 alkyl sulfo methyl ester or any of the C8 - 18 alkyl sulfate or sulfonate group of surfactants.<br>
Further, it has surprisingly been found that a mixture of<br>
15   emollients that are a combination of. two or more of C8-18 alkyl fatty acids, fatty esters, fatty alcohols, triglycerides or hydrocarbons is more effective, especially when a hydrocarbon with a titer less than 50°C is employed. In this case some of the fatty acid components can have <br>
20   titer as high as 70-80°C, while the other emollient components can be having titer as low as 1-2°C.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a combination toilet bar, including but not limited to: <br>

and<br>
rubbing the wet bar on the skin to deposit the emollients and/or skin active ingredients while cleansing the skin.<br>
15   Surfactants are an essential component of the inventive toilet bar.  They are compounds that have hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions that act to reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solutions they are dissolved in.  Useful surfactants can include soap(s), and non-soap anionic,<br>
20  nonionic, amphoteric, and cationic surfactants, and blends thereof.<br>
The inventive toilet bar contains soap, preferably it contains at least about 50 % by wt. of soap.  The term<br>
25  "soap" is used herein in its popular sense, i.e., the alkali metal or alkanol ammonium salts of alkane- or alkene monocarboxylic acids. Sodium, potassium, mono-, di- and tri-ethanol ammonium cations, or combinations thereof, are suitable for purposes of this invention. _ In general, sodium<br>
30  soaps are used in the compositions of this invention, but from about 1 % to about 25 % of the soap may be ammonium,<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
potassium, magnesium, calcium or a mixture of these soaps. The soaps useful herein are the well known alkali metal salts of alkanoic or alkanoic acids having about 12 to 22 carbon atoms, preferably about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. <br>
5    They may also be described as alkali metal carboxylates of alkyl or alkene hydrocarbons having about 12 to about 22 carbon atoms.<br>
Soaps having the fatty acid distribution of coconut oil may<br>
10  provide the lower end of the broad molecular weight range. Those soaps having the fatty acid distribution of peanut or rapeseed oil, or their hydrogenated derivatives, may provide the upper end of the broad molecular weight range.  It is preferred to use soaps having the fatty acid distribution of<br>
15  tallow, and vegetable oil.  More preferably the vegetable oil is selected from the group consisiting of palm oil, coconut oil, palm kernal oil, palm stearin, and hydrogenated rice bran oil, or mixtures thereof, since these are among the more readily available fats.<br>
20<br>
Especially preferred is coconut oil.  The proportion of fatty acids having at least 12 carbon atoms in coconut oil soap is about 85 %.  This proportion will be greater when mixtures of coconut oil and fats such as tallow, palm oil,<br>
25  or non- tropical nut oils or fats are used, wherein the<br>
principle chain lengths are C16 and higher.  Preferred soap for use in the compositions of this invention has at least about 85 % fatty acids having about 12-18 carbon atoms.<br>
30  Coconut oil employed for the soap may be substituted in<br>
whole or in part by other "high-lauric" oils, that is oils<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
or fats wherein at least 50 % of the total fatty acids are composed of lauric or myristic acids and mixtures thereof. These oils are generally exemplified by the tropical nut oils of the coconut oil class.  For instance, they include:<br>
5     palm kernel oil, babassu oil, ouricuri oil, tucum oil, cohune nut oil, murumuru oil, jaboty kernel oil, khakan kernel oil, dika nut oil, and ucuhuba butter.<br>
 A preferred soap is a mixture of about 15 % to about 30 % <br>
10   coconut oil and about 70 % to about 85 % tallow.  These<br>
mixtures contain about 95 % fatty acids having about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. As mentioned above, the soap may preferably be prepared from coconut oil, in which case the<br>
 fatty acid content is about 85 % of C12-C18 chain length.<br>
15   The soaps may contain unsaturation in accordance with<br>
commercially acceptable standards.  Excessive unsaturation is normally avoided.<br>
Soaps may be made by the classic kettle boiling process or<br>
2	0  modern continuous soap manufacturing processes wherein<br>
natural fats and oils such as tallow or coconut oil or their equivalents are saponified with an alkali metal hydroxide using procedures well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the soaps may be made by neutralizing fatty<br>
25  acids, such as lauric (C12), myristic (C14), palmitic (C16),<br>
or stearic (Cis) acids with an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate.<br>
The toilet bar of the present invention contains one or more<br>
3	0  non-soap anionic detergents (syndets).  Preferably the<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
syndets have a zein value of 50 or less.  Zein value may be measured using the test method described below. Advantageously non-soap anionic detergents or surfactants are used from about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1 % or 2 I by wt. <br>
5    to about 4 %, 5 %, 7 %, or 10 % by wt.<br>
The anionic detergent active which may be used may be aliphatic sulfonates, such as a primary alkane (e.g., C8-C22)<br>
sulfonate, primary alkane (e.g., C8-C22) disulfonate, C8-C22<br>
10   alkene sulfonate, C8-C22 hydroxyalkane sulfonate or alkyl<br>
glyceryl ether sulfonate (AGS); or aromatic sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonate.<br>
The anionic may also be an alkyl sulfate (e.g., C12-C18 alkyl<br>
15  sulfate) or alkyl ether sulfate (including alkyl glyceryl ether sulfates).  Among the alkyl ether sulfates are those having the formula:<br>
RO(CH2CH20)nSO3M<br>
20<br>
wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl having 8 to 18 carbons, preferably 12 to 18 carbons, n has an average value of greater than 1.0, preferably greater than 3; and M is a solubilizing cation such as sodium, potassium, ammonium or<br>
25  substituted ammonium. Ammonium and sodium lauryl ether sulfates are preferred.<br>

Method of making the formulations<br>
The surfactant blends are made separately, or the individual surfactants are directly injected in the neat soap at the <br>
5         required level.  Similarly the superfat/emollient blend is injected directly in the neat soap, or the individual superfatting/emollient ingredients are injected in the neat soap before drying.  All the ingredients can be added through neat soap except color and fragrance.  These<br>
10        components can be added in the chip mixer along with the soap noodles then mixed, plodded and stamped in the form of bars.  Some of the superfatting/emollient ingredients can be added in the chip mixer instead of injecting in the neat soap.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF TEST I4ETHODS Methods of testing<br>
5  a)  Latheribility index test<br>
The latherability index of toilet bars are determined by-using the Lather Index Ratio.  Formula A is taken as control for the relative evaluation.  Lather Index Ratio is the<br>
10  ratio of the lather generated by the inventive example to the control (Bar A) .  Lather volume is measured by using a water displacement method.  In this method the wet bar is rotated for 5 times in wet hands and then about 10 ml water (at about 30°C) is taken in the hand.  Lather is generated in<br>
15  the hand by rubbing both the hands against each other. Both the hands are dipped in water under an inverted funnel. The generated lather is collected by the inverted funnel and quantified via an attached graduated cylinder.  Lather volume is measured in mis at about 3 0°C.<br>
20<br>
b)  Titer method (for superfatting agents/emollients)<br>
For the hydrophobic emollients with a titer more than room temperature, a small quantity of emollient is transferred to<br>
25  a glass capillary that is sealed on one side and the<br>
capillary is attached to the bulb of a thermometer.  The capillary attached to the thermometer is dipped in water in a glass beaker.  The water in the glass beaker is slowly heated and the temperature of the water is recorded by the<br>
30  thermometer attached to the capillary.  The titer of the<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   36   -<br>
material is the temperature at which the emollient or superfatting agent is observed to start melting.<br>
c)   Krafft point determination 5<br>
Make up a 10 % by wt. solution of surfactant in water.  If needed, heat the system to dissolve the surfactant completely.  Transfer the clear solution to a glass test tube.  Place the test tube in a beaker equipped with a<br>
10  stirrer and filled with sufficient water to evenly cool the surfactant solution.  The solution should be cooled with continuous stirring and the temperature should be continuously recorded.  Note the temperature when the crystallization process begins such that the solution becomes<br>
15   turbid.  This temperature is taken as the Krafft point.  If the crystallization temperature is below room temperature, add ice to the beaker to cool the test tube below room temperature to measure the sub-ambient Krafft point.<br>
20  d)  Mildness test<br>
i)  The mildness of the inventive toilet bars was assessed by the Forearm Controlled Application Test (FCAT) Clinical Test Methodology as follows. 25<br>
This controlled washing test is similar to that described by Ertel et al.  (A forearm controlled application technique for estimating the relative mildness of personal cleansing products, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 46, 67 (1995)).<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   37   -<br>
Subjects report to the testing facility for the conditioning phase of the study, which consists of using an assigned marketed personal washing cleanser for general use at home, up to four days prior to start of the product application <br>
5   phase.  On Day 1 of the product application phase, a visual assessment is made to determine subject qualification. Subjects must have dryness scores &gt;1.0 and erythema scores 0.5, and be free of cuts and abrasions on or near the test sites to be included in the product application phase.<br>
10  Subjects who qualify to enter the product application phase will then be instructed to discontinue the use of the conditioning product and any other skin care products on their inner forearms, with the exception of the skin cleansing test formulations that are applied during the wash<br>
15  sessions.<br>
Qualified subjects will then have four 3.0 cm diameter (round) evaluation sites marked on each of the forearms using a skin-safe pen (a total of eight sites).  Visual<br>
20   evaluations for erythema and dryness will be conducted immediately prior to the first wash in each session and again in the afternoon of the final day (Day 5).<br>
Washing Procedure for Bar Products 25<br>
1. Both arms are washed simultaneously. Test sites are treated in a sequential manner starting with the site closest to the flex area, ending with the site proximal to the wrist.<br><br>
WO 2005/100532	PCT/EP2005/003370<br>
-   38   -<br>
2. The sites closest to the flex area of the inner forearm of both the right and left arm are moistened with warm water (90°-100°F).<br>
5      3. A moistened Masslinn towel is rubbed in a circular motion on a wetted test bar for approximately 6 seconds by study personnel which will result in 0.2-0.5 g of product to be dispensed.<br>
10       4.  The site is washed with the designated product for 10 seconds followed by a 90 second lather retention phase.<br>
5.	The above procedure (1-4) is then repeated for each<br>
of the test sites. Sites are then be rinsed (e.g. using a<br>
15  temperature of 35°C) for fifteen seconds and patted dry.<br>
6.	Upon completion the entire procedure is repeated<br>
(two washes/session).<br>
20  Evaluation Methods<br>
Baseline visual assessments are made prior to the start of the product application phase, and immediately before each wash session thereafter, to evaluate dryness and erythema.<br>
25  The final visual evaluation is conducted on the afternoon of the final day.<br>
The 0-6 grading scale shown in Table 4 is used to assess the test sites for dryness and erythema.  To maintain the <br>
30  evaluator's blindness to product assignment, visual<br><br>
WO 2005/100532	PCT/EP2005/00337<br>
-   39   -<br>
assessments are conducted in a separate area away from the product application area.<br>
TABLE 4 Erythema and Dryness grading scale. 5<br><br>
Grade	Erythema	Dryness<br>
0	None	None<br>
1.0	Barely perceptible	Patches of slight powderiness and redness occasional patches of small scales may be seen. Distribution generalized.<br>
2.0	Slight redness	Generalized slight powderiness. Early cracking or occasional small lifting scales may be present.<br>
3:0	Moderate redness	Generalized moderate powderiness and/or heavy cracking and lifting scales.<br>
4.0	Heavy or substantial	Generalized heavy powderiness and/or redness heavy cracking and lifting scales.<br>
5.0	Extreme redness;	Generalized high cracking and lifting scales. Powderiness may be present but not prominent. May see bleeding cracks.<br>
6.0	Severe redness	Generalized severe cracking. Bleeding cracks. Bleeding cracks may be present. Scales large, may be beginning to disappear.<br>
Instrumental readings are taken on the first (baseline) and final day of the study.<br>

PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   40   -<br>
Mildness of test product is calculated as 1/(mean change in dryness at end of the study).<br>
In addition to visual evaluation, instrumental assessments <br>
5   of the treated sites will be conducted using an evaporimeter and skin conductance meter as described in the reference above.<br>
Instrumental Assessment<br>
10<br>
All instrumental evaluations will be taken following a 30 minute acclimation period.  The indoor humidity and temperature data will be recorded and included in the final report.  Instrumental measurements may be taken at some or<br>
15  all of the following time points: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,   8 and 24 hours after product application.  Instruments to be used with this protocol include: The Derma Lab Model #CR 200001-140, ServoMed Evaporimeter with EP1 or EP2 probe, Corneometer CM820, the; Skicon Skin Hygrometer with the MT-8C<br>
20  probe, and the Moisture Checker.  The room temperature will be maintained at 20° to 25° C and 30 % to 40 % Relative Humidity.  Moisturization is defined as mean change from baseline of visual dryness or skin hydration.<br>
25  Transepidermal Water Loss Test (TEWL)<br>
The Derma Lab Model #CR 200001-140 was used to quantify the rates of transepidermal water loss following the procedures similar to those outlined by Murahata et al ("The use of <br>
30  transepidermal water loss to measure and predict the<br>
irritation response to surfactants" Int. J. Cos. Science 8,<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   41   -<br>
225 (1986)) . TEWL provides a quantitative measure of the integrity of the stratum corneum barrier function and the relative effect  of cleansers.<br>
5     The operating principle of the instrument is based on Fick's law where:<br>
(1/A)(dm/dt)=  - D   (dp/dx)<br>
where<br>
2 A = area of the surface (m )<br>
10  m = weight of transported water (g)<br>
t = time (hr)<br>
D = constant, 0.0877 g-1 h-1 (mm Hg)-1 related to the<br>
diffusion coefficient of water<br>
p = partial pressure of water vapor in air (mm Hg) <br>
15  x = distance of the sensor from the skin surface (m)<br>
The evaporation rate, dm/dt, is proportional to the partial pressure gradient, dp/dx.  The evaporation rate can be determined by measuring the partial pressures, at two points <br>
20  whose distance above the skin is different and known, and where these points are within a range of 15-20 mm above the skin surface.<br>
The general clinical requirements are as follows: <br>
25  1.  All panelists are equilibrated for a minimum of fifteen minutes before measurements in a test room in which the temperature and relative humidity are controlled. 2.  The test sites are measured or marked in such a way that pre- and post-treatment measurements' can be taken at <br>
30  approximately the same place on the skin.<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   42   -<br>
3.	The probe is applied in such a way that the sensors are<br>
perpendicular to the test site, using a minimum of pressure.<br>
Probe Calibration is achieved with a calibration set (No.<br>
2110) which is supplied with the instrument.  The kit must<br>
5  be housed in a thermo-insulated box to ensure an even temperature distribution around the instrument probe and calibration flask.<br>
The three salt solution used for calibration are LiCl, <br>
10  Mg(N03)2, and K2S04.  Pre-weighed amounts of salt at high purity are supplied with the kit instrument.  The solution concentrations are such that the three solutions provide a RH of A 11.2 %, A 54.2 %, and A 97 % respectively at 21°C.<br>
15  General use of the instrument is as follows.<br>
1.	For normal studies, instrument readings are taken with the selector switch set for 1-100 g/m2 h range.<br>
2.	The protective cap is removed from the probe and the<br>
2	0  measuring head is placed so that the Teflon capsule is<br>
applied perpendicularly to the evaluation site ensuring that a- minimum pressure is applied from the probe head.  To minimize deviations of the zero point, the probe head should be held by the attached rubber-insulating stopper. <br>
25  3.  Subject equilibration time prior to prior to evaluation is 15 minutes in a temperature/humidity controlled room.<br>
4.	The probe is allowed to stabilize at the test site for<br>
a minimum of 3 0 seconds before data acquisition.  When air<br>
drafts exist and barrier damage is high it is recommended to<br>
3	0  increase the stabilization time.<br><br>

5.  Data is acquired during the 15 seconds period following the stabilization time.<br>
Skin Hydration Test 5<br>
The Corneometer CM802PC (Courage &amp; Khazaha, Kohl, Germany) is a device widely used in the cosmetic industry.  It allows high frequency, alternating voltage electrical measurements of skin capacitance to be safely made via an electrode<br>
10  applied to the skin surface.  The parameters measured have been found to vary with skin hydration.  However, they may also vary with many other factors such as skin temperature, sweat gland activity, and the composition of any applied product.  The Corneometer can only give directional changes<br>
15 in the water content of the upper stratum corneum under favorable circumstances, but even here the quantitative interpretations may prove misleading.<br>
A widely used alternative is the Skicon Skin conductance 20  Meter (I.B.S. Co Ltd. Shizuoka-ken, Japan).<br>
Panellist Requirements for either instrument are as follows.<br>
1.	Subjects should equilibrate to room conditions, which<br>
25  are maintained at a fixed temperature and relative humidity<br>
for a minimum of 15 minutes with their arms exposed.  Air currents should be minimized.<br>
2.	Physical and psychological distractions should be<br>
minimized, e.g., talking and moving around.<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   44   -<br>
3.	Consumption during at least 1 hour before measurement<br>
of hot beverages or of any products containing caffeine<br>
should be avoided.<br>
4.	Panelists should avoid smoking for at least 30 minutes<br>
5  prior to measurements.<br>
Operating Procedure<br>
1.	The probe should be lightly applied so as to cause<br>
10  minimum depression of the skin surface by the outer casing. The measuring surface- is spring-loaded, and thus the probe must be applied with sufficient pressure that the black cylinder disappears completely inside the outer casing.<br>
2.	The probe should be held perpendicular to the skin<br>
15  surface.<br>
3-.   The operator should avoid contacting hairs on the measure site with the probe.<br>
4.	The probe should remain in contact with the skin until<br>
the instrument's signal beeper sounds (about 1 second) and<br>
20  then be removed.  Subsequent measurements can be made<br>
immediately provided the probe surface is known to be clean.<br>
5.	A minimum of 3 individual measurements should be taken<br>
at separate points on the test area and averaged to<br>
represent the mean hydration of the site.<br>
25  6.  A dry paper tissue should be used to clean the probe between readings.<br>
e)   Moisturizer Deposition test<br>
30  Pre-condition the subject's skin (arms/legs) with non-moisturizer containing product for up to 2 days prior to<br><br>
WO 2005/100532<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/003370<br><br>
-   45   -<br>
testing.  A baseline extraction is performed to estimate level of moisturizer (e.g. fatty acids) present on the skin prior to product application. Controlled single application of product to skin (arms or legs) is made.  For wash, bar is<br>
5   rubbed on skin for 30 sec. and the lather left on for 90 sec, rinsed for 30 sec. (e.g. using a temperature of 35°C) then gently pat dry.  Following this, the site is extracted using a suitable solvent (IPA)/methanol 1:1).  The extraction is performed as follows: A glass cup (3cm diameter) is placed<br>
10  on the skin.  3 mis of solvent is placed into this and gently stirred with a glass rod for 2 minutes.  The solvent is removed with a pipette.  This step is repeated with a fresh 3 mis of solvent, to collect a total of 6 mis extract.  The extracts are analyzed for stearic acid/palmitic acid content<br>
15  using either LC/MS or GC/MS, or the like.<br>
f)  Skin abrasiveness test<br>
Skin abrasiveness is defined as consumer rated response of <br>
20  abrasivity on a 0-9 scale (0 means no abrasion, 10 is abrasivity caused by a pouf (i.e. a showering implement composed of thin plastic filaments, see also e.g. US Patent No. 5,650,384 to Gordon et al.) .<br>
25  This test is performed with 50 untrained consumers.  They are asked to rate the abrasiveness of the test product on a 0-9 point scale.  The data is normalized based on their response to a bar with no exfoliants which is assigned a value of zero and a pouf that is assigned a value of 9., The test products<br>
30  are applied to the flex area of the forearm by wetting the bar and rubbing back and forth 10-15 times.<br><br>

g)   pH test method<br>
Form an aqueous slurry by blending 10 grams of the bar <br>
5    formula with 90g of water to create a 10 % slurry.  The pH of the slurry is then measured at 25°C.<br>
h)   Zein test method<br>
10  The inventive toilet bar preferably has a zein solubility of under about 50, 40, 30, and most preferably under about 25 using the zein solubility method set forth below.  The lower the zein score, the milder the product is considered to be. This method involves measuring the solubility of zein (corn<br>
15  protein) in cleansing base solutions as follows.<br>
0.3 g of cleansing base and 29.7 g of water at room temperature (25°C) are mixed thoroughly.  To this is added 1.5 g of zein, and mixed for 1 hour.  The mixture is then<br>
20  centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm.  After<br>
centrifugation, the pellet is extracted, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 hours until substantially all the water has evaporated. The weight of the dried pellet is measured and percent zein solubilized is calculated using<br>
25  the following equation:<br>
% Zein solubilized = 100 (1-weight of dried pellet/1.5) .<br>
The % Zein is further described in the following references;<br>

i)	Patch testing <br>
5<br>
A 48 hr continuous or 14 day cumulative insult patch test may be used. In the 48 hr patch test 5 % to 15 % solution/slurry of the product is applied onto the upper arm/back of the subject using a standard cotton pad.  Irritation response is<br>
10  recorded for up to 24 hrs after removal of the patch.  In the 14 day cumulative test a 5 % to 15 % solution/slurry of the product is applied repeatedly every 24 hrs for 14 days. Irritation response is recorded for up to 24 hrs after removal of patch.<br>
15<br>
Mildness of test product is evaluated as 1/(mean erythema at 24 hr after final patch removal).<br>
