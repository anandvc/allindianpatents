				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of prebiotic enriched fruits and vegetables by osmotic dehydration using fructooligosaccharide syrup. The process in particular uses the fructooligosaccharide syrup produced by the action of Fructosyl Transferase (FTase) enzyme on table sugar solution. The fruits and vegetables are enriched with FOS and in turn FOS is enriched with leached out nutrients from the fruits and vegetables. The FTase for the production of FOS obtained from Aspergillus oryzae MTCC 5154 grown by submerged fermentation.<br>
The interest in developing functional food is rising, driven largely by the market potential for foods and beverages that can improve the health and well being of consumers. Reference may be made to L.Berner and J.O'Donnell international Dairy Journal, 8, 355-362, 1998, wherein functional food or nutraceuticals were defined as food containing health promoting components that extend beyond traditional nutrients.<br>
References may be made to B.H.Lee, Fundamentals of Food Biotechnology, VCH, Publishers Inc, New York, 1996, wherein a vast and rapidly growing body of scientific data shows that diet plays an important part in disease management. Diet is thought to contribute to 6 of the 10 leading causes of death. Upto 70% of certain cancers may be attributed to diet. There is an increasing demand by consumers for quality of life, which is fueling the nutraceutical revolution. The use of nutraceuticals in daily diet is one of the means to reduce escalating health care costs, that will contribute not only to a longer lifespan, but also more importantly, to a longer health span.<br>
Development of foods that promote health and well being is one of the key research priorities of food industry. This trend has increased the consumption of foods enriched with physiologically active components (PAC) such as pre-biotics, pro-biotics, vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber, fish oils and plant sterols. The traditional ingredients like vitamins and minerals used to fortify functional foods are widely recognized and accepted by consumers as being healthy. However, novel functional ingredients like pre-biotics and pro-biotics are less familiar to consumers.<br>
References may be made to R. Fuller, Journal of Applied Bacteriology, 66. 65-72,1989, wherein pro-biotics were defined as "friendly" microorganisms that contribute to health and to the balance of the intestinal tract. References may be made to K. Kailasapathy and J. Chin, Immunology and Cell Biology, 78, 80-88, 2000, wherein it is reported that the probiotic organisms have been shown to exert numerous health benefits when ingested on a regular basis. References may be made to T. Matilla-Sandholm et . al, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 10, 393-399,1999, wherein it is documented that probiotics can improve overall health, increase immune system function and assist in the absorption of vitamins and minerals.<br>
In comparison to probiotics, the prebiotics are non-viable food components that are necessary for an immune system. References may be made to C.J, Ziemer &amp;G.R. Gibson, International Dairy Journal, 8,473-479,1998, wherein the prebiotics were reported to selectively nourish the beneficial intestinal flora, stimulate their development, and reinforce their action.<br>
The development and consumption of functional foods, or foods that promote health beyond providing basic nutrition, are on the rise. Vacuum Impregnation, Atmospheric Impregnation and/or Osmotic Dehydration seem to be feasible technologies for exploitation of fruit and vegetable tissues as new matrices into which functional ingredients can be successfully incorporated, providing novel functional product categories and new commercial opportunities. The impregnation behaviour of vegetable and fruit matrices is highly produce-specific and processing and storage of these functional foods may have profound effect on health benefits. Fruit and vegetable matrices will certainly be an important research and development area for future functional food markets. Knowledge to assess the effects of these matrices in the body is also a highly desirable goal.<br>
Even with the development of newer drying techniques, most fruits and vegetables are still air- dried because this method of dehydration is still the simplest and most economical. Major problems associated with air dehydration are the considerable shrinkage caused by the cell collapse following the loss of water, the poor rehydration<br>
characteristic of the dried product, and the unfavorable changes in colour, texture, flavour and nutritive value caused by drying.<br>
Water removal from piece - form foods is primarily done to lower water activity, so that microbial growth is inhibited. One of the more energy efficient means of removing moisture from a food piece is by osmotic dehydration, since water does not have to go through a phase change. The technique of using the difference in osmotic potential between a product and the medium surrounding it has been used on various food items.<br>
Osmotic treatments are based on placing foods in a hypertonic sugar/salt solution in order to obtain some effects on concentration, dehydration and impregnation -formulation of food itself by exchange of solutes with the solution. It is possible to a certain extent, to change the food system formulation, making it more suitable to further processing by:<br>
•	Adjusting the physico-chemical composition of food by reducing water content, or adding<br>
water activity lowering agents<br>
•	Incorporating ingredients or additives with anti-oxidant, or other preservative properties<br>
into the food<br>
•	Adding solutes of nutritional or sensory interest<br>
•	Providing a larger range of food consistency.<br>
Many authors have studied the different aspect of osmotic dehydration such as the solutes to be employed, the influence of process behaviour on drying behaviour, the opportunity to combine osmosis to other stabilizing techniques, and the quality of final products etc.<br>
Some of the stated advantages of direct osmosis in comparison with other drying processes include minimized heat damage to colour and flavor and less discolourization of fruit by enzymatic oxidative browning.<br>
References may be made to Rodriguez, 1998 Rodriguez, M. I. (1998). Estudio de la penetration de microorganismos enfrutas mediante el modelo Hidrodinzmico (HDM). Thesis. Institute de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Alimentos, Universidad Central de<br>
Venezuela, wherein conducted basic impregnation studies with different microorganisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Phoma glomeratd) to evaluate their penetration by Vacuum Impregnation into a porous fruit tissue. Apple was selected as a model of porous fruit, cut into cylinders and impregnated with sucrose isotonic solution containing the microorganisms. The draw back of the product is the high content of sucrose, which restricts its use due to high calorie and no prebiotic effect.<br>
References may be made to J.E.Contreras and T.C.Smyrl, Can.Inst.Food Science and Technology, 14,310,1981, wherein the use of corn syrup solids (dextrose equivalent 28) as the osmotic solute to concentrate apple rings was reported. It was observed that the weight of apple rings could be reduced by 70% during the osmotic concentration process. The excessive intake of the sugar with more calorific value is a major problem of this process.<br>
References may be made to J.H.Moy, N.B.H.Lau, and A.M.Dollar, Journal of Food Processing, 2:131, 1978, wherein; intermediate moisture foods were produced by immersing the fruit into a 70 Brix sucrose solution to reduce their weight by 50 %. But the product showed stickiness due to the excess amount of sucrose.<br>
References may be made to J.C.Curry, E.E.Burns and N.D.HeidelbaughJournal of Food Science, 41,176,1976 and H.J. Neumann, Journal of Food Science , 37, 437, 1972, wherein the treatment of sliced vegetables with sodium chloride, sugars and glycol prior to dehydration improved rehydration, colour, texture and flavour of the finished product. Here the mixed taste of salt and sugar reduces the consumer demand of the product. The product also lacks functional properties.<br>
References may be made to J. Hawkes and J.M.Flink, Journal of Food Processing and Preservation, 2: 265, 1978, wherein the taste scores were reported which verify the organoleptic acceptability of apple slices concentrated by sucrose osmotic solutions. It has been stated that fruit dried using sugar are in fact candy, due to high percentage of sugar added to the fruit. The effectiveness of mixed carbohydrate systems for osmotic<br>
concentration of apple slices was also reported. Since the calorific value of sucrose is very high, health conscious consumer may not accept this product.<br>
No reports are available on the development of prebiotic enriched fruit and vegetables. FOS are functional food ingredients and have become of major interest because of their prebiotic characteristics. The specific physiological effects on humans, for example growth stimulation of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the digestive tract, decrease of total cholesterol and lipid in serum, relief of constipation and general improvement of human health are other important characteristics. These short chain Fructans are only about one-third as sweet as sucrose and have low calorific value.<br>

A known amount of the final product were collected randomly and macerated with a minimum known quantity of water by using a mortar and pestle. The paste formed was filtered with a muslin cloth. The filtrate was appropriately diluted with distilled water and analysed by HPLC using a Refractive Index Detector for Detecting the FOS content. The final product showed a maximum FOS content of about 8.72 g per 100 g of osmotically dried papaya.<br>
The amount of P-Carotene pigment leached out into the FOS syrup was determined by taking the difference between the P-Carotene content of the fresh papaya before dehydration and the P-Carotene content of the papaya after osmotic dehydration. (Ranganna,, 1997, Plant pigments: In: Manual of analysis of fruit and vegetable products; pp 73-77). The percentage loss of P-Carotene from papaya was found to be 31% and the amount of P-Carotene gained by 100 ml of FOS during osmotic dehydration was found to be 507 f.tg.<br>
The texture of the product was measured at 25 % Compression (Load Cell: 1000N and Cross-head speed 50 mm/ minute). The texture was found to be 13+1 N as against 20+ 1 N for fresh papaya. The colour of the product was measured in a Hunterlab Colour measuring system. The L, a and b values for the final product were found to be 41.54, 0.56 and 20.10 respectively as against 50.90, 1.18 and 21.38 respectively for fresh papaya.<br>
The rehydration ratio of the end product ( after drying to a final moisture level of 8%) cooked at different durations of 3, 6 and 9 minutes were found to be 1.40. 1.46 and 1.53 respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE: 7<br>
Cleaned and peeled semi ripened papaya with an initial moisture content of 91+0.5 were cut into cubes of 1 cm and incubated with 70° brix Fructooligosaccharide syrup in a papaya - osmotic solution ratio of 2:3 (w/v) for 18 hours at 55 C with shaking. After incubation, osmotically dehydrated products were drained and allowed for surface<br>
drying by keeping open in the air for a few minutes. The osmotically dried product showed moisture content of 54 + 0.5%. The products were then dried to a final moisture level of 5% by keeping in a hot air oven at 60 C .<br>
A known amount of the final product were collected randomly and macerated with a minimum known quantity of water by using a mortar and pestle. The paste formed was filtered with a muslin cloth. The filtrate was appropriately diluted with distilled water and analysed by HPLC using a Refractive Index Detector for Detecting the FOS content. The final product showed a maximum FOS content of about 12.01g per 100 g of osmotically dried papaya.<br>
The amount of P-Carotene pigment leached out into the FOS syrup was determined by taking the difference between the P-Carotene content of the fresh carrots before dehydration and the P-Carotene content of the carrots after osmotic dehydration. (Ranganna, 1997, Plant pigments: In: Manual of analysis of fruit and vegetable products; pp 73-77). ). The percentage loss of P-Carotene from papaya was found to be 16% and the amount of P-Carotene gained by 100 ml of FOS during osmotic dehydration was found to be 261 fag.<br>

After incubation, osmotically dehydrated products were drained and allowed for surface drying by keeping open in the air for a few minutes. The osmotically dried product showed a moisture content of 56+_0.5%.The product were then dried to a final moisture level of 5% by keeping in a hot air oven at 60°C .<br>
A known amount of the final product were collected randomly and macerated with a minimum known quantity of water by using a mortar and pestle. The paste formed was filtered with a muslin cloth. The filtrate was appropriately diluted with distilled water and analysed by HPLC using a Refractive Index Detector for detecting any FOS content. The final product showed the absence of FOS.<br>
The amount of P-Carotene pigment leached out into the FOS syrup was determined by taking the difference between the p-Carotene content of the fresh carrots before dehydration and the P-Carotene content of the carrots after osmotic dehydration. (Ranganna, 1997, Plant pigments. In: Manual of analysis of fruit and vegetable products; pp 73-77). The percentage loss of P-Carotene from papaya was found to be 43% and the amount of P-Carotene gained by 100 ml of osmotic sugar solution during osmotic dehydration was found to be 706 ug.<br>
The texture of the product was measured at 25 % Compression (Load Cell: 1000N and Cross-head speed 50 mm/ minute) and was expressed as N. The texture was found to be 8+1 N as against 20+ 1 N for fresh papaya. The colour of the product was measured in a Hunterlab Colour measuring system.
