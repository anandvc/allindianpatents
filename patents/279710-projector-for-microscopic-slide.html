				<td>TITLE<br>
MICROSCOPIC SLIDE PROJECTOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improvements in light microscopes which<br>
needed essentially for biological/microscopic examination and observation for<br>
students and teachers during practical work. It has been noticed that simply for<br>
observing a microscopic specimen under the microscope, not only much time is<br>
spent but also a number of microscopes my be needed for the satisfaction and<br>
benefit of a group of students in the study room at the same time naturally the<br>
overall cost will be increased. More particularly it is a Microscopic Slide<br>
Projector with the powerful magnification than the conventional light<br>
microscope along with a fine adjustment which may be readily operated, and<br>
which is of simple construction, easy of manufacture, capable of being readily<br>
assembled and optically strain free. By this Projector microscopic slide can be<br>
projected directly on the screen<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Past information about as such type of present invention of Chandra<br>
Microscopic Slide Projector is unknown.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is disclosed to solve the aforementioned problems and its<br>
object of the present invention to provide lightweight Microscopic Slide<br>
Projector and so the easy mobility of this projector can be possible.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective device,<br>
which is useful for the students and teachers in schools, colleges even<br>
universities.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device, which is useful<br>
in field.<br>
It is another object of the present invention is to provide powerful magnifier<br>
attached with this projector as compared to the conventional light microscope.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device by which<br>
microscopic slide can be projected directly on the screen.<br>
