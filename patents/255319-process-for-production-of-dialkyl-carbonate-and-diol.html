PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF DIALKYL CARBONATE AND DIOL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a dialkyl<br>
carbonate and a diol by reacting a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol together.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Several processes for the production of a dialkyl carbonate and a diol from a<br>
reaction between a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol have been<br>
proposed, with four systems having been proposed hitherto as reaction systems.<br>
These four reaction systems are used in a process for the production of dimethyl<br>
carbonate and ethylene glycol from ethylene carbonate and methanol, which is the<br>
most typical reaction example.<br>
A first system is a completely batch reaction system in which ethylene<br>
carbonate, methanol and a catalyst are put into an autoclave to proceed the reaction,<br>
which is a batch reaction vessel (see, for example, Patent Document 1: U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,642,858, Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
54-48715 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,181,676), Patent Document 5:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 54-63023, Patent Document 6:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 54-148726, Patent Document 7:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 55-64550, Patent Document 8:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 55-64551, Patent Document 9:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 56-10144).	<br>
A second system is a batch reaction system having a distillation column,<br>
which uses an apparatus in which a distillation column is provided on a top of a<br><br>
reaction vessel, and in which ethylene carbonate, methanol and a catalyst are fed<br>
into the reaction vessel, and reaction is made to proceed by heating to a<br>
predetermined temperature (see, for example, Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 51-122025 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,062,884),<br>
Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 54-48716<br>
(corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,307,032), Patent Document 14: U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,803,201).<br>
A third system is a continuous flow reaction system in which a mixed solution<br>
of ethylene carbonate and methanol is continuously fed into a tubular reactor<br>
maintained at a predetermined reaction temperature, and a reaction mixture<br>
containing unreacted ethylene carbonate, unreacted methanol, produced dimethyl<br>
carbonate, and produced ethylene glycol is continuously withdrawn in a liquid form<br>
from an outlet on the other side (see, for example, Patent Document 10: Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-41432 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,661,609), Patent Document 11: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
63-238043, Patent Document 12: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
64-31737 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,691,041), Patent Document 13: U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,734,518).<br>
A fourth system is a reactive distillation system, i.e. a continuous production<br>
process in which ethylene carbonate and methanol are each continuously fed into a<br>
multi-stage distillation column, and reaction is carried out in the presence of a<br>
catalyst in a plurality of stages in the distillation column, while the separation of<br>
produced dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol is carried out in the same<br>
distillation column simultaneously (see, for example, Patent Document 15: Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-198141, Patent Document 16: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 4-230243, Patent Document 17: Japanese Patent<br><br>
Application Laid-Open No. 5-213830 (corresponding to German Patent No.<br>
4,129,316), Patent Document 18: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
6-9507 (corresponding to German Patent No. 4,216,121)).<br>
In this way, the processes proposed hitherto for producing the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and the diol from the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
are the four systems:<br>
(1)	the completely batch reaction system;<br>
(2)	the batch reaction system using the reaction vessel having the distillation column<br>
provided on the top thereof;<br>
(3)	a flowing liquid reaction system using the tubular reactor; and<br>
(4)	the reactive distillation system.<br>
However, problems have been pointed out for these as follows.<br>
In the case of (1) and (3), the upper limit of the cyclic carbonate conversion is<br>
determined by the composition put in and the temperature, and hence the reaction<br>
cannot be carried out to completion, and thus the conversion is low, because this<br>
 reaction id equilibrium reaction with low equilibrium constant. Moreover, in the case<br>
of (2), to make the cyclic carbonate conversion high, a very large amount of the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol must be used. In the case of (4), the reaction can be<br>
made to proceed with a higher conversion than with (1), (2) or (3), and hence this is<br>
the best reaction. For example, in Example 1 in Patent Document 15 (Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-198141), the ethylene carbonate conversion is<br>
100%, and the ethylene glycol reaction yield and selectivity are 99.5%. Moreover, in<br>
Example 1 in Patent Document 16 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
4-230243), the ethylene carbonate conversion is 100%, and the ethylene glycol<br>
reaction yield and selectivity are 99.4%. In this way, with the reactive distillation<br>
system (4), a high conversion and a high selectivity are exhibited. Furthermore, to<br><br>
cope with the case that a small amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate remains in the<br>
produced diol, there have also been proposed a process in which the unreacted<br>
cyclic carbonate is hydrolyzed (see, for example, Patent Document 19: International<br>
Publication No. 97/23445), and a process in which the unreacted cyclic carbonate is<br>
converted into an ether through reaction with the diol (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 20: International Publication No. 00/51954).<br>
However, while studying the reactive distillation system proposed hitherto, a<br>
new problem has been discovered in that the diol produced has a low ultra violet light<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated to "UV") transmittance at a certain wavelength, and contains<br>
an aldehyde compound. With regard to this problem, there has been proposed a<br>
process in which a high-purity diol having a high UV transmittance and a low<br>
aldehyde content is obtained by feeding specified water into a diol distillation<br>
purification step (see, for example, Patent Document 21: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2002-308804, Patent Document 22: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2004-131394). However, with this system, because<br>
water is fed into the diol distillation purification step, there is a problem that the<br>
process becomes complicated. Further improvement is thus required.<br>
For the case of producing the dialkyl carbonate and the diol from the cyclic<br>
carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol, up to now there has not been<br>
proposed a process that simultaneously satisfies the cyclic carbonate conversion<br>
being high, the selectivities for the dialkyl carbonate and diol to be produced being<br>
high, and a high-purity diol having a high UV transmittance and a low aldehyde<br>
content being obtained without carrying out complicated treatment such as feeding<br>
water into a diol distillation purification step.<br><br>
Problem to be solved by the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide, for a case of producing a<br>
dialkyl carbonate and a diol from a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol, a process that simultaneously satisfies the cyclic carbonate conversion being<br>
high, the selectivities for the dialkyl carbonate and diol to be produced being high,<br>
and a high-purity diol having a high UV transmittance and a low aldehyde content<br>
being obtained without carrying out complicated treatment such as feeding water into<br>
a diol distillation purification step.<br>
Means for solving the problem<br>
The present inventors have carried out assiduous studies focusing on the<br>
mechanism of a reaction in which material such as an aldehyde that reduces the UV<br>
transmittance of a diol is produced, and as a result have reached to the present<br>
invention after discovering that the reaction conditions (residence time, temperature)<br>
in a transesterification reactor comprising a tray column type continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column play an important influence on the reaction producing UV<br>
transmittance-reducing material, and moreover that this influence differs between a<br>
tray portion and a column bottom portion.<br>
That is, the present invention provides:<br>
1. In a process for continuous production of a dialkyl carbonate and a diol, by<br>
continuously feeding a first starting material containing a cyclic carbonate as a main<br>
component thereof and a second starting material containing an aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol as a main component thereof into a tray column type continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column, bringing the starting materials into contact with a catalyst present<br>
in said distillation column so as to bring about reaction in a tray portion and a column<br>
bottom portion, continuously withdrawing a low boiling point component containing a<br><br>
produced dialkyl carbonate from an upper portion of said distillation column, and<br>
continuously withdrawing a high boiling point component containing a produced diol<br>
from a lower portion of said distillation column, wherein the improvement comprises:<br>
the following formula (1) being satisfied,<br><br>
wherein<br><br>
θ1	(hours) is an average residence time of the reaction liquid in the tray<br>
portion of said distillation column in which the catalyst is present;<br>
T1 (°C) is a temperature at a (n/2)th stage (a ((n+1)/2)th stage in the case that<br>
n is odd) from the top of the tray portion in which the catalyst is present wherein n is a<br>
total number of stages therein;<br>
θ2	(hours) is an average residence time of the reaction liquid in the column<br>
bottom portion of said distillation column; and<br>
T2 (°C) is a temperature in the column bottom portion,<br>
2.	the process for continuous production of the dialkyl carbonate and the diol<br>
according to item 1, wherein the catalyst is a homogeneous catalyst,<br>
3.	the process for continuous production of the dialkyl carbonate and the diol<br>
according to item 1 or 2, wherein θ1 is in a range of from 0.3 to 20 hours, and θ2 is in<br>
a range of from 0.3 to 25 hours,<br>
4.	the process for continuous production of the dialkyl carbonate and the diol<br>
according to any one of items 1 to 3, wherein each of T1 and T2 is in a range of from<br>
-20 °C to 350 °C.<br>
Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br><br>
According to the process of the present invention, when producing the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and the diol from the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol,<br>
there can be simultaneously satisfied the cyclic carbonate conversion being high, the<br>
selectivities for the dialkyl carbonate and diol to be produced being high, and a<br>
high-purity diol having a high UV transmittance and a low aldehyde content being<br>
obtained without carrying out complicated treatment such as feeding water into a diol<br>
distillation purification step.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Following is a detailed description of the present invention.<br>
The reaction of the present invention is a reversible equilibrium<br>
transesterification reaction represented by following general formula (I) in which<br>
dialkyl carbonates (C) and diols (D) are produced from cyclic carbonates (A) and<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohols (B).<br><br><br>
[wherein R1 represents a bivalent group -(CH2)m- (m is an integer from 2 to 6), one<br>
or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted with an alkyl group or<br>
aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Moreover, R2 represents a monovalent<br>
aliphatic group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, one or more of the hydrogens thereof<br>
being optionally substituted with an alkyl group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms.]<br>
In the present invention, UV transmittance-reducing material in the diol is a<br>
trace component that has not been fully identified, but it is thought that aldehyde (E)<br>
is produced from the diol (D) through an irreversible dehydration reaction<br>
represented by following general formula (II).<br><br>
[wherein, R3 represents a monovalent group CH3-(CH2)m-2- (m is an integer from 2 to<br>
6), one or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted with an alkyl<br>
group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.]<br>
It is thought that this aldehyde (E) and material produced through further<br>
reaction of the aldehyde (E) form the UV transmittance-reducing material.<br>
The reason why, in the present invention, it is possible to simultaneously<br><br>
satisfy the cyclic carbonate conversion being high, the selectivities for the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and diol to be produced being high, and the high-purity diol having the<br>
high UV transmittance and the low aldehyde content being obtained without carrying<br>
out complicated treatment such as feeding water into the diol distillation purification<br>
step is not clear, but is thought to be as follows.<br>
The above reaction (II) is a first-order dehydration reaction of the diol, and it<br>
is thought that the residence time and the temperature greatly affect the reaction, the<br>
reaction proceeding more the greater the residence time or the temperature. In<br>
particular, it is thought that the reason that the order for the temperature is higher<br>
than that for the residence time for each of α and β in formula (1) in the present<br>
invention is that the temperature dependence of above reaction (II) is greater than<br>
the residence time dependence. Moreover, in the transesterification reactor<br>
comprising the tray column type continuous multi-stage distillation column, the diol in<br>
the high boiling point component is withdrawn from a lower portion of the column,<br>
and hence it is thought that the diol concentration is higher in the column bottom<br>
portion than in the tray portion, and thus the contribution to aldehyde production from<br>
the reaction mechanism of above reaction (II) is greater for the column bottom<br>
portion, and hence the coefficient for β in formula (1) in the present invention is<br>
greater than for α.<br>
In the present invention, if the value of α + 1.24xβ in formula (1) is greater<br>
than 5150, then the produced diol has a low UV transmittance and a high aldehyde<br>
content, i.e. a low-purity diol is obtained. If the value of a + 1.24x(3 is less than 780,<br>
then reaction (I) does not proceed, and hence the cyclic carbonate conversion and<br>
the dialkyl carbonate and diol selectivities decrease. Accordingly, as the range in<br>
formula (1), the reaction condition 780 ≤ α + 1.24xβ ≤ 5150 is chosen, preferably<br>
1200 ≤ α + 1.24xβ ≤ 4300, more preferably 1600 ≤ α + 1.24xβ ≤ 3700.<br><br>
If the average residence time of the reaction liquid θ1 (hours) in the tray<br>
portion of said distillation column in which the catalyst is present is too long, then<br>
reaction (II) proceeds and aldehyde is produced, whereas if θ1 is too short, then<br>
reaction (I) does not proceed and hence the cyclic carbonate conversion and the<br>
dialkyl carbonate and diol selectivities decrease; θ1 is thus generally in a range of<br>
from 0.3 to 20 hours, preferably from 0.5 to 10 hours, more preferably from 0.8 to 6<br>
hours. In addition, diol concentration is extremely low in the tray portion in which the<br>
catalyst is not present, because reaction (I) does not proceed. Therefore, reaction<br>
(II) also does not proceed.<br>
For similar reasons, the average residence time of the reaction liquid θ2<br>
(hours) in the column bottom portion of said distillation column is generally in a range<br>
of from 0.3 to 25 hours, preferably from 0.5 to 16 hours, more preferably from 1.0 to<br>
11 hours.<br>
The temperature T1 (°C) at the (n/2)th stage (the ((n+1)/2)th stage in the case<br>
that n is odd) from the top of the tray portion in which the catalyst is present wherein<br>
n is a total number of stages therein, and the temperature T2 (°C) in the column<br>
bottom portion vary depending on the types of the starting material compounds used<br>
and the reaction pressure, but T1 is generally in a range of from -20 to 350 °C,<br>
preferably from 0 to 200 °C, more preferably from 30 to 170 °C, and T2 is generally in<br>
a range of from -20 to 350 °C, preferably from 10 to 250 °C, more preferably from 50<br>
to 220 °C. If these temperatures are too high, then reaction (II) proceeds and the<br>
aldehyde is produced, whereas if these temperatures are too low, then reaction (I)<br>
does not proceed and hence the cyclic carbonate conversion and the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and diol selectivities decrease.<br>
Moreover, the operating pressure of said distillation column may be any of a<br>
reduced pressure, normal pressure, or an applied pressure, and in terms of absolute<br><br>
pressure is generally in a range of from 1 Pa to 2x106 Pa, preferably from 1x103 to<br>
 1 x 106 Pa, more preferably from 1 x 104 to 5x 105 Pa. The operating pressure is<br>
generally determined from the composition in said distillation column such that the<br>
reaction temperatures T1 and T2 in said distillation column become suitable<br>
temperatures.<br>
The form of the transesterification reactor used in the present invention is a<br>
tray column type continuous multi-stage distillation column. The term "continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column" refers to a distillation column that has a plurality of, i.e.<br>
at least two, distillation stages, and that enables continuous distillation to be carried<br>
out. The term "stages" in the present invention refers to the actual number of stages<br>
of trays.<br>
As the tray column type continuous multi-stage distillation column, any one<br>
generally used as a continuous type tray column type multi-stage distillation column<br>
can be used, for example one using trays such as bubble-cap trays, sieve trays,<br>
valve trays, or counterflow trays. Moreover, in the case of using a solid catalyst, a<br>
tray column type continuous multi-stage distillation column in which this solid catalyst<br>
is fixed in the tray stages and the column bottom portion can be used. Moreover, as<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column used in the present invention, a<br>
distillation column as above may be used alone, or a plurality of such distillation<br>
columns may be used in combination connected together in series or parallel.<br>
The cyclic carbonate used as a starting material in the present invention is a<br>
compound represented by (A) in above reaction formula (I). Examples of the cyclic<br>
carbonate include alkylene carbonates such as ethylene carbonate, propylene<br>
carbonate, 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2-one, 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2-one, or the like, which<br>
are preferably used in the present invention, ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate being more preferably used due to ease of procurement and so on, and<br><br>
ethylene carbonate being particularly preferably used.<br>
Moreover, the aliphatic monohydric alcohol used as the other starting<br>
material is a compound represented by (B) in above reaction formula (I). An<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a lower boiling point than the diol produced is<br>
used. Although possibly varying depending on the type of the cyclic carbonate used,<br>
examples of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol include methanol, ethanol, propanol<br>
(isomers), allyl alcohol, butanol (isomers), 3-buten-1-ol, amyl alcohol (isomers), hexyl<br>
alcohol (isomers), heptyl alcohol (isomers), octyl alcohol (isomers), nonyl alcohol<br>
(isomers), decyl alcohol (isomers), undecyl alcohol (isomers), dodecyl alcohol<br>
(isomers), cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, cycloheptanol, cyclooctanol,<br>
methylcyclopentanol (isomers), ethylcyclopentanol (isomers), methylcyclohexanol<br>
(isomers), ethylcyclohexanol (isomers), dimethylcyclohexanol (isomers),<br>
diethylcyclohexanol (isomers), phenylcyclohexanol (isomers), benzyl alcohol,<br>
phenethyl alcohol (isomers), phenylpropanol (isomers), and so on. Furthermore,<br>
these aliphatic monohydric alcohols may be substituted with substituents such as<br>
halogens, lower alkoxy groups, cyano groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups,<br>
aryloxycarbonyl groups, acyloxy groups, and nitro groups.<br>
Of such aliphatic monohydric alcohols, ones preferably used are alcohols<br>
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e.<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol (isomers), and butanol (isomers). In the case of using<br>
ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate as the cyclic carbonate, preferable<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohols are methanol and ethanol, methanol being particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
In the process of the present invention, a catalyst is made to be present in<br>
the transesterification reactor. The method of making the catalyst be present may<br>
be any method, but in the case, for example, of a homogeneous catalyst that<br><br>
dissolves in the reaction liquid under the reaction conditions, the catalyst can be<br>
made to be present in the liquid phase in the transesterification reactor by feeding the<br>
catalyst into the transesterification reactor continuously, or in the case of a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst that does not dissolve in the reaction liquid under the reaction<br>
conditions, the catalyst can be made to be present in the reaction system by<br>
disposing the catalyst as a solid in the transesterification reactor; these methods may<br>
also be used in combination.<br>
In the case that a homogeneous catalyst is continuously fed into the<br>
multi-stage distillation column constituting the transesterification reactor, the<br>
homogeneous catalyst may be fed in together with the cyclic carbonate and/or the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol, or may be fed in at a different position to the starting<br>
materials. The transesterification catalyst may be fed in at any position at least one<br>
stage from the bottom of the column. However, the reaction actually proceeds in<br>
said distillation column in a region below the position at which the catalyst is fed in,<br>
and hence it is preferable to feed said catalyst into a region between the top of the<br>
column and the position at which the starting materials are fed in.<br>
Moreover, in the case of using a heterogeneous solid catalyst, said catalyst<br>
can be installed in the required amount in any chosen position in the reactor, the<br>
number of stages in which said catalyst is present being at least one stage,<br>
preferably at least two stages.<br>
In the case of using a heterogeneous solid catalyst, degradation and / or<br>
degeneration of the catalyst may occur under prolonged continuous operation, and in<br>
such a case it is necessary to replace new solid catalyst. It is thus more preferable<br>
to use a homogeneous catalyst.<br>

Bu3PbCI, Ph3PbBr, Ph3Pb (or Ph6Pb2), Bu3PbOH, Ph2PbO or the like (wherein Bu<br>
represents a butyl group, and Ph represents a phenyl group); lead alloys such as<br>
Pb-Na, Pb-Ca, Pb-Ba, Pb-Sn, Pb-Sb or the like; lead minerals such as galena and<br>
zinc blende; and hydrates of such lead compounds;<br>
ion exchangers such as anion exchange resins having tertiary amino groups,<br>
ion exchange resins having amide groups, ion exchange resins having at least one<br>
type of exchange groups selected from sulfonate groups, carboxylate groups and<br>
phosphate groups, and solid strongly basic anion exchangers having quaternary<br><br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups, or the like;<br>
solid inorganic compounds such as silica, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia,<br>
aluminosilicates, gallium silicate, various zeolites, various metal-exchanged zeolites,<br>
and ammonium-exchanged zeolites, or the like.<br>
As a solid catalyst, a particularly preferably used one is a solid strongly basic<br>
anion exchanger having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups.<br>
Examples thereof include a strongly basic anion exchange resin having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups, a cellulose-based strongly basic anion<br>
exchanger having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups, and an<br>
inorganic carrier supported type strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary<br>
ammonium groups as exchange groups. Examples of the strongly basic anion<br>
exchange resin having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups include a<br>
styrene type strongly basic anion exchange resin or the like. The styrene type<br>
strongly basic anion exchange resin is a strongly basic anion exchange resin having<br>
a copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene as a parent material, and having<br>
quaternary ammonium groups (type I or type II) as exchange groups, and can be<br>
schematically represented, for example, by following formula (III).<br><br><br>
In the above formula, X represents an anion; examples of X generally include at least<br>
one type of anion selected from F-, CI-, Br-, I-, HCO3-, CO32-, CH3CO2-, HCO2-, IO3-,<br>
BrO3-, and CIO3-, preferably at least one type of anion selected from CI-, Br-, HCO3-,<br>
and CO32-. Moreover, examples of the structure of the resin parent material include<br>
a gel type one or a macroreticular (MR) type, the MR type being particularly<br>
preferable due to the organic solvent resistance being high.<br>
Examples of the cellulose-based strongly basic anion exchanger having<br>
quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups include cellulose having<br>
-OCH2CH2NR3X exchange groups obtained by converting some or all of the -OH<br>
groups in the cellulose into trialkylaminoethyl groups. Herein, R represents an alkyl<br>
group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or the like, preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
Moreover, X is defined as above.<br>
The inorganic carrier supported type strongly basic anion exchanger having<br><br>
quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups that can be used in the present<br>
invention means an inorganic carrier that has had -O(CH2)nNR3X quaternary<br>
ammonium groups introduced thereto by modifying some or all of the -OH surface<br>
hydroxyl groups of the inorganic carrier. Herein, R and X are defined as above, and<br>
n is generally an integer from 1 to 6, preferably n = 2. Examples of the inorganic<br>
carrier include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, titania, zeolite or the like, preferably<br>
silica, alumina, or silica-alumina, particularly preferably silica.<br>
Any method can be used as the method of modifying the surface hydroxyl<br>
groups of the inorganic carrier. For example, the inorganic carrier and an<br>
aminoalcohol HO(CH2)nNR2 are made to undergo a dehydration reaction in the<br>
presence of a basic catalyst so as to introduce aminoalkoxy groups, and then<br>
reaction is carried out with an alkyl halide RX' (X' represents a halogen, CI, Br, I or<br>
the like generally being used) to obtain -O(CH2)nNR3X' groups. Anion exchange is<br>
then further carried out, so as to obtain -O(CH2)nNR3X quaternary ammonium groups<br>
having the desired anion X. Moreover, in the case that n = 2, the inorganic carrier<br>
may be treated with an N,N-dialkylaziridine to obtain -OCH2CH2NR2<br>
N,N-dialkylaminoethoxy groups, and then -O(CH2)nNR3X groups may be obtained<br>
using the above method.<br>
The solid strongly basic anion exchanger having quaternary ammonium<br>
groups as exchange groups is commercially available. In this case, the anion<br>
exchanger may also be used as the transesterification catalyst after being subjected<br>
to ion exchange with a desired anionic species in advance as pretreatment.<br>
Moreover, a solid catalyst comprising a macroreticular or gel-type organic polymer<br>
having bonded thereto heterocyclic groups each containing at least one nitrogen<br>
atom, or an inorganic carrier having bonded thereto heterocyclic groups each<br>
containing at least one nitrogen atom can also be preferably used as the<br><br>
transesterification catalyst. Furthermore, a solid catalyst in which some or all of<br>
these nitrogen-containing heterocyclic groups have been converted into a quaternary<br>
salt can be similarly used.<br>
The amount of the catalyst used in the present invention varies depending on<br>
the type of the catalyst used, but in the case of continuously feeding in a<br>
homogeneous catalyst that dissolves in the reaction liquid under the reaction<br>
conditions, the amount used is generally in a range of from 0.001 to 50 % by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.001 to 25 % by weight, more preferably from 0.005 to 10 % by<br>
weight, as a proportion of the total weight of the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol fed in as the starting materials. Moreover, in the case of using<br>
the solid catalyst installed in said distillation column, the catalyst is preferably used in<br>
an amount in a range of from 0.01 to 75 vol%, more preferably from 0.05 to 50 vol%,<br>
yet more preferably from 0.1 to 25 vol%, based on the empty column volume of said<br>
distillation column.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method of continuously feeding the<br>
cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol into the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column constituting the transesterification reactor; any feeding method<br>
may be used so long as the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
can be made to contact the catalyst in a region of at least one stage, preferably at<br>
least two stages, of said distillation column. That is, said cyclic carbonate and said<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol can be continuously fed in from a required number of<br>
inlets in stages of the continuous multi-stage distillation column satisfying the<br>
conditions described above. Moreover, said cyclic carbonate and said aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol may be introduced into the same stage of said distillation column,<br>
or may be introduced into different stages to one another.<br>
The starting materials may be fed continuously into said distillation column in<br><br>
a liquid form, in a gaseous form, or as a mixture of a liquid and a gas. Other than<br>
feeding the starting materials into said distillation column in this way, it is also<br>
preferable to additionally feed in a gaseous starting material intermittently or<br>
continuously from the lower portion of said distillation column. Moreover, another<br>
preferable method is one in which said cyclic carbonate is continuously fed in a liquid<br>
form or a gas/liquid mixed form into a stage of said distillation column above the<br>
stages in which the catalyst is present, and said aliphatic monohydric alcohol is<br>
continuously fed in a gaseous form and/or a liquid form into the lower portion of said<br>
distillation column. In this case, the cyclic carbonate may of course contain the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol.<br>
In the present invention, the starting materials fed in may contain a small<br>
amount of the diol as a product. Moreover, the aliphatic monohydric alcohol used<br>
may contain the dialkyl carbonate, the percentage by weight of the dialkyl carbonate<br>
in the aliphatic monohydric alcohol / dialkyl carbonate mixture generally being in a<br>
range of from 0 to 40 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, more<br>
preferably from 1 to 20 % by weight.<br>
The amount ratio between the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol fed into the transesterification reactor varies according to the type and<br>
amount of the transesterification catalyst and the reaction conditions, but the molar<br>
ratio of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the cyclic carbonate fed in is generally in a<br>
range of from 0.01 to 1000 times. To increase the cyclic carbonate conversion, it is<br>
preferable to feed in the aliphatic monohydric alcohol in an excess of at least 2 times<br>
the number of mols of the cyclic carbonate, but if the amount of the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol used is too great, then it is necessary to make the apparatus<br>
larger. For such reasons, it is particularly preferable for the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol to be used in an amount of 2 to 20 times the number of mols of the cyclic<br><br>
carbonate.<br>
In the present invention, if carbon dioxide gas is present in the<br>
transesterification reactor in a high concentration, then the reaction rate for the<br>
transesterification reaction decreases. The reaction is thus generally carried out<br>
with the CO2 concentration in the reaction liquid at not more than 500 ppm, preferably<br>
not more than 200 ppm, more preferably not more than 100 ppm.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, if water is present in the reaction liquid in<br>
the transesterification reactor in a high concentration, then hydrolysis of the cyclic<br>
carbonate proceeds at the same time as the transesterification reaction, and hence<br>
the dialkyl carbonate selectivity decreases. The reaction is thus generally carried<br>
out with the H2O concentration in the reaction liquid at not more than 200 ppm,<br>
preferably not more than 100 ppm.<br>
In the present invention, if it is attempted to make the cyclic carbonate<br>
conversion in the transesterification reaction close to 100%, then the residence time<br>
increases and hence, as described above, it becomes impossible to obtain a<br>
high-purity diol, the required amount of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol becomes too<br>
high. Moreover, it is undesirable for the conversion to be too low, since then an<br>
apparatus for separating out and recovering unreacted cyclic carbonate becomes<br>
large. The transesterification reaction is thus generally carried out with the cyclic<br>
carbonate conversion in a range of from 95 to 99.999%, preferably from 98 to<br>
99.99%, more preferably from 99 to 99.99%.<br>
In the present invention, the dialkyl carbonate as one of the products is<br>
withdrawn from the transesterification reactor, generally being withdrawn from an<br>
upper portion of said reactor as a gaseous low boiling point component. The low<br>
boiling point component withdrawn from the upper portion of the reactor may<br>
comprise the dialkyl carbonate alone, or may be a mixture of the aliphatic<br><br>
monohydric alcohol and the dialkyl carbonate, and may contain a small amount of<br>
high boiling point products.<br>
In the continuous multi-stage distillation column constituting the<br>
transesterification reactor, as an outlet from which the low boiling point component<br>
containing the dialkyl carbonate is withdrawn from said multi-stage distillation column,<br>
a gaseous material outlet is preferably provided between the starting material feeding<br>
position and the top of the column or at the top of the column, and is particularly<br>
preferably provided at the top of the column. So-called refluxing in which some of<br>
the low boiling point component withdrawn in this way is returned into the upper<br>
portion of said distillation column may also be carried out. If the reflux ratio is<br>
increased through this refluxing, then the efficiency of distillation of low boiling point<br>
products into the vapor phase is increased, and hence the low boiling point product<br>
concentration in the withdrawn gaseous component can be increased. However, it<br>
is undesirable to increase the reflux ratio too much, since then the required amount<br>
of thermal energy becomes high. The reflux ratio used is thus generally in a range<br>
of from 0 to 10, preferably from 0 to 5, more preferably from 0 to 3.<br>
The low boiling point mixture withdrawn from the upper portion of the<br>
transesterification reactor can be fed into a dialkyl carbonate separating apparatus,<br>
and the dialkyl carbonate can be obtained by being withdrawn from the dialkyl<br>
carbonate separating apparatus. Examples of the dialkyl carbonate separating<br>
apparatus include a distillation separating apparatus, an extraction separating<br>
apparatus, a liquid-liquid extraction separating apparatus, a crystallization separating<br>
apparatus, an adsorption separating apparatus, a membrane separating apparatus,<br>
or the like. The separating apparatus may also be constituted from a plurality of<br>
such apparatuses of the same type, or a combination of a plurality of types of<br>
separating apparatuses may be used. Of the above separating apparatuses, it is<br><br>
particularly preferable to use the distillation separating apparatus.<br>
In the case of using the distillation separating apparatus as said dialkyl<br>
carbonate separating apparatus, the low boiling point mixture withdrawn from the<br>
upper portion of the transesterification reactor is led into the distillation separating<br>
apparatus, where the components such as the dialkyl carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol contained in said reaction liquid or mixture can be separated out<br>
as a distillate or a column bottom liquid each comprising one of the components or a<br>
mixture thereof. Depending on the types of the starting materials, an azeotropic<br>
mixture may be obtained as a distillate or the column bottom liquid. After the<br>
reaction liquid or the low boiling point mixture withdrawn from the upper portion of the<br>
transesterification reactor has been separated into the distillate and the column<br>
bottom liquid by using the distillation separating apparatus in this way, the column<br>
bottom liquid or distillate containing the aliphatic monohydric alcohol can be fed back<br>
into the transesterification reactor.<br>
As the distillation separating apparatus, a tray type multi-stage distillation<br>
column like the multi-stage distillation column used as the transesterification reactor<br>
may be used, or a packed column type distillation column packed with any of various<br>
packings may be used; such a column may be used alone, or a plurality may be used<br>
in combination. Here, the case that the aliphatic monohydric alcohol and the dialkyl<br>
carbonate are a combination forming a minimum boiling point azeotropic mixture is<br>
taken as an example in the following, specifically the case that methanol is used as<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol and dimethyl carbonate will be explained. The low<br>
boiling point mixture withdrawn from the upper portion of the transesterification<br>
reactor containing methanol and dimethyl carbonate is continuously fed into the<br>
dimethyl carbonate separating column, a low boiling point component containing a<br>
minimum boiling point azeotropic mixture of methanol and dimethyl carbonate is<br><br>
continuously withdrawn from an upper portion of said dimethyl carbonate separating<br>
column, and dimethyl carbonate is continuously withdrawn from a lower portion of<br>
said dimethyl carbonate separating column, whereby dimethyl carbonate can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Said dimethyl carbonate separating column is operated under a reduced<br>
pressure or an applied pressure, the operating pressure generally being in a range of<br>
from 0.5x105 to 50x105 Pa (0.51 to 51 kg/cm2) in terms of the absolute pressure.<br>
The composition of the methanol / dimethyl carbonate minimum boiling point<br>
azeotropic mixture varies according to the operating pressure, and hence the<br>
operating pressure of said dimethyl carbonate separating column is selected to be an<br>
operating pressure such that dimethyl carbonate can be obtained from the lower<br>
portion of the column. That is, a pressure higher than the pressure corresponding to<br>
the methanol / dimethyl carbonate ratio in the material withdrawn from the upper<br>
portion of the transesterification reactor is selected.<br>
The low boiling point component containing the minimum boiling point<br>
azeotropic mixture of methanol and dimethyl carbonate withdrawn from the upper<br>
portion of the dimethyl carbonate separating column can be fed into the<br>
transesterification reactor as starting material for the process of the present invention.<br>
The upper portion of the continuous multi-stage distillation column in the<br>
present invention refers to a region from the top of said distillation column to a<br>
position at a height approximately 1/2 of the column height, and includes the top of<br>
the column. Moreover, the lower portion of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column refers to a region from the bottom of said distillation column to a position at a<br>
height approximately 1/2 of the column height, and includes the bottom of the<br>
column.<br>
The diol produced in the transesterification reactor is withdrawn from the<br><br>
lower portion of said reactor as a liquid high boiling point component. This high<br>
boiling point mixture contains the produced diol and unreacted cyclic carbonate, and<br>
may also contain the aliphatic monohydric alcohol, or the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol and the dialkyl carbonate.<br>
An outlet from which the liquid high boiling point mixture containing the<br>
produced diol is withdrawn from the transesterification reactor is provided in the lower<br>
portion of said reactor. Some of the reaction mixture withdrawn in this way may be<br>
heated using a reboiler and thus put into a gaseous form or a gas / liquid mixed form,<br>
and then returned into the lower portion of said reactor.<br>
For the continuous multi-stage distillation column constituting the<br>
transesterification reactor, the liquid velocity and the gas velocity in said distillation<br>
column vary depending on the type of the trays used, but are generally made to be<br>
within a range such that flooding and weeping do not occur.<br>
Some of the liquid high boiling point mixture withdrawn from the lower portion<br>
of the transesterification reactor may be fed back into the transesterification reactor<br>
so as to circulate unreacted cyclic carbonate and / or unreacted aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol back into said transesterification reactor.<br>
When the high boiling point mixture containing the diol obtained as described<br>
above is subjected to separation in a diol purification step, generally, (1) in the case<br>
that the low boiling point component such as starting material aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol is contained, it is preferable to separate out said aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
or the like in advance using the separating apparatus such as a distillation apparatus<br>
and recycle the aliphatic monohydric alcohol back into the transesterification reactor,<br>
or (2) it is preferable for unreacted cyclic carbonate contained in said high boiling<br>
point mixture to be separated out in advance before feeding into the purification step.<br>
As the method of separating out the unreacted cyclic carbonate contained in said<br><br>
high boiling point mixture, there can be used, for example, (i) distillation separation,<br>
(ii) a method of converting into diol through hydrolysis, or (iii) a method of eliminating<br>
the unreacted cyclic carbonate through an ether producing reaction between the<br>
cyclic carbonate and the diol. It is particularly preferable to use the ether producing<br>
reaction.<br>
That is, as a preferable separation method carried out on the high boiling<br>
point mixture withdrawn from the transesterification reactor before feeding into the<br>
diol purification step, two following methods can be used.<br>
1. An example is a method in which, before the liquid high boiling point<br>
mixture withdrawn from the transesterification reactor is fed into the diol purification<br>
step, said liquid high boiling point mixture is continuously fed into a low boiling point<br>
component separating column comprising a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
having a side cut outlet provided in a lower portion thereof, a low boiling point<br>
component containing the dialkyl carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
remaining in said high boiling point mixture is continuously withdrawn from an upper<br>
portion of the low boiling point component separating column, a distillate containing<br>
the diol and the cyclic carbonate is withdrawn from the side cut outlet, and said low<br>
boiling point component withdrawn from the upper portion of the low boiling point<br>
component separating column is fed into the transesterification reactor and thus<br>
circulated back, while the distillate withdrawn from the side cut outlet of said low<br>
boiling point component separating column is fed into an ether producing reaction<br>
apparatus so as to carry out an ether producing reaction, before feeding into the diol<br>
purification step.<br>
Examples of the low boiling point component separating column in clued a<br>
tray type multi-stage distillation column like the multi-stage distillation column used as<br>
the transesterification reactor, or a packed column type distillation column packed<br><br>
with any of various packings may be used.<br>
2. An example is a method in which, before the liquid high boiling point<br>
mixture withdrawn from the transesterification reactor is fed into the diol purification<br>
step, said liquid high boiling point mixture is continuously fed into a low boiling point<br>
component separating column comprising a multi-stage distillation column, a low<br>
boiling point component containing the dialkyl carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol remaining in said high boiling point mixture is continuously<br>
withdrawn from an upper portion of the low boiling point component separating<br>
column, a high boiling point component containing the diol and the cyclic carbonate is<br>
withdrawn from a lower portion of said low boiling point component separating<br>
column and at this time an ether producing reaction is carried out in the lower portion<br>
of said low boiling point component separating column, and said low boiling point<br>
component withdrawn from the upper portion of the low boiling point component<br>
separating column is continuously fed into the transesterification reactor and thus<br>
circulated back, while the high boiling point component containing the diol and a<br>
produced ether withdrawn from the lower portion of said low boiling point component<br>
separating column is fed into the diol purification step.<br>
When carrying out the above ether producing reaction, an ether producing<br>
reaction method described in Patent Document 20 (International Publication No.<br>
00/51954) can be used, that is a method in which the mixture containing the<br>
produced diol and the unreacted cyclic carbonate is fed into an ether producing<br>
reaction apparatus, and the unreacted cyclic carbonate is subjected to an ether<br>
producing reaction with some of the produced diol, thus converting the unreacted<br>
cyclic carbonate into a straight chain ether represented by the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is defined as above, whereby the amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate is<br><br>
reduced.<br>
The reaction conditions in the ether producing reaction apparatus vary<br>
according to whether or not a catalyst is used, and the type and amount of the<br>
catalyst in the case that a catalyst is used, but the reaction temperature is generally<br>
in a range of from 50 to 350 °C, preferably from 80 to 300 °C, more preferably from<br>
100 to 250 °C. The reaction time varies according to whether or not a catalyst is<br>
used, the type and amount of the catalyst in the case that a catalyst is used, and the<br>
reaction temperature, but is generally in a range of from 0.001 to 50 hours in terms of<br>
the average residence time, preferably from 0.01 to 10 hours, more preferably from<br>
0.02 to 5 hours. The reaction pressure also varies according to the reaction<br>
temperature used, but is generally in a range of from 1x103 to 2x107 Pa in terms of<br>
the absolute pressure, preferably from 1x104 to 1x107 Pa.<br>
The cyclic carbonate conversion in the ether producing reaction is generally<br>
in a range of from 90 to 100%, preferably from 95 to 100%, more preferably from 98<br>
to 100%.<br>
Moreover, if carbon dioxide is introduced into the transesterification reactor,<br>
then the transesterification reaction is impeded, and hence the reaction rate<br>
decreases. It is thus preferable to separate out carbon dioxide withdrawn from the<br>
ether producing apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, upon subjecting the reaction liquid containing the diol to<br>
separation using the distillation separation step as described in Patent Document 21<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-308804) or Patent Document 22<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-131394), a high-purity diol having<br>
a high UV transmittance and a low aldehyde content can be obtained even if a<br>
method in which water is fed into the distillation separation step is not used, although<br>
this method may of course be used at the same time.<br><br>
In the present invention, it is not necessary to use a solvent, but with an<br>
objective of (1) facilitating the reaction operation, (2) obtaining the dialkyl carbonate<br>
and the diol efficiently by carrying out azeotropic distillation or extractive distillation,<br>
or the like, a suitable inert solvent such as ethers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, or halogenated aromatic<br>

multi-stage distillation column in a gaseous form.<br>
Examples<br>
Following is a detailed description of Examples of the present invention.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to the following Examples.<br>
In the following Examples, the selectivities for the ethylene glycol and the<br>
dimethyl carbonate are values based on the ethylene carbonate consumed, and the<br>
yields for the ethylene glycol and the dimethyl carbonate are values based on the<br>
ethylene carbonate put in. The position of each stage in the distillation column is<br>
represented by the number of that stage counting from the top of the column as the<br>
first stage. The aldehyde concentration was measured using a colorimetric method<br>
[(1) a suitable amount of the sample and 5 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.2 % by<br>
weight of ferric chloride (FeCI3-6H2O) and 0.32 % by weight of sulfamic acid were<br>
added to 50 ml of distilled water and uniform mixing was carried out, and then the<br>
mixture was left to stand for 1 hour; (2) 25 ml of the aqueous solution of 0.2 % by<br><br>
weight of ferric chloride (FeCI3-6H2O) and 0.32 % by weight of sulfamic acid was<br>
added, and distilled water was further added to make up to 100 ml; and (3) the<br>
absorbance at a wavelength of 635 nm was measured, and using a calibration curve<br>
produced with acetaldehyde as a reference substance, the concentration of aldehyde<br>
contained in the sample was determined as the acetaldehyde weight concentration<br>
converted value].<br>
Example 1:<br>
Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene glycol (EG) were produced<br>
continuously from ethylene carbonate (EC) and methanol (MeOH) using the<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 1. EC was continuously fed in a liquid form from a conduit<br>
2 via a preheater 3 at a flow rate of 200 g / h into the 3rd stage of a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 1 comprising an Oldershow distillation column having<br>
an inside diameter 4cm and 40 stages, an ethylene glycol solution of 18 % by weight<br>
of potassium hydroxide (KOH) (homogeneous catalyst) was continuously fed in a<br>
liquid form also into the 3rd stage via a conduit 2' at a flow rate of 0.95 g / h, and a<br>
mixture of MeOH and DMC (weight ratio: MeOH / DMC = 97/3) was continuously<br>
fed in a liquid form into the 20th stage of the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
1 from a conduit 5 via a preheater 6 at a flow rate of 636.4 g / h. The pressure at<br>
the top of the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was atmospheric pressure,<br>
and the temperature at the top of the column was 63.8 °C. The temperature Ti at<br>
the 21st stage (the 19th stage from the top of the total number of 38 stages in the tray<br>
portion in which the catalyst was present) was 80.5 °C, the temperature T2 in the<br>
column bottom portion was 98 °C, the average residence time of the reaction liquid θ1<br>
in the tray portion in which the catalyst was present was 2.4 hours, and the average<br>
residence time of the reaction liquid θ2 in the column bottom portion was 4.3 hours,<br><br>
the total average residence time thus being 6.7 hours. From these values, α +<br>
1.24β = 2607.<br>
A gaseous low boiling point mixture distilled off from the top 4 of the column<br>
was condensed using a condenser 7, and some of the mixture was refluxed back into<br>
the top of the column via a conduit 8 (reflux ratio = 0.4), while the remainder was fed<br>
as a column top withdrawn liquid (containing 67.9 % by weight of MeOH and 32.1 %<br>
by weight of DMC) at a flow rate of 695.4 g / h via a conduit 9 into a position 80 cm<br>
from the top of a DMC separating column 71 comprising a packed column type<br>
distillation column of inside diameter 2.5 cm and packed height 160 cm packed with<br>
Dixon packings (3φ) as packings.<br>
Some of a column bottom liquid withdrawn via a conduit 11 from the bottom<br>
10 of the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was heated in a reboiler 12 so<br>
as to supply energy required for the distillation thereto, and the remainder of the<br>
column bottom liquid was fed as a liquid high boiling point mixture [containing<br>
70.65 % by weight of EG, 29.16 % by weight of MeOH, 0.08 % by weight of EC,<br>
0.02 % by weight of DMC, 0.01 % by weight of diethylene glycol (DEG) and other<br>
high boiling point impurities, and 0.08 % by weight of KOH] at a flow rate of 200.2 g h<br>
via a conduit 14 into a position 100 cm from the top of a low boiling point component<br>
separating column 17 comprising a packed column type distillation column of inside<br>
diameter 2.5 cm and packed height 160 cm packed with Dixon packings (3φ) as<br>
packings.<br>
The EC conversion for the transesterification reaction was 99.92%, the DMC<br>
selectivity was 99.9%, and the EG selectivity was 99.9%.<br>
The DMC separating column 71 was operated at a column top pressure of<br>
1.4x106 Pa, and a column bottom temperature of 205 °C. A gaseous low boiling<br>
point mixture distilled off from the top 72 of the DMC separating column 71 was<br><br>
condensed using a condenser 75, and some of the mixture was refluxed back into<br>
the top of the column via a conduit 77 (reflux ratio = 2), while the remainder was<br>
merged via a conduit 78 into the conduit 5, and fed into the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 1 via the preheater 6. The composition of the liquid fed in from<br>
the conduit 5 was changed gradually from the MeOH / DMC mixture initially to MeOH<br>
only such that the composition fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
1 was kept constant.<br>
Some of a column bottom liquid withdrawn via a conduit 79 from the bottom<br>
73 of the DMC separating column 71 was heated in a reboiler 80 so as to supply<br>
energy required for the distillation thereto, and the remainder of the column bottom<br>
liquid was withdrawn via a conduit 82 at a flow rate of 204.3 g / h. The column<br>
bottom liquid was 99.9 % by weight DMC.<br>
The low boiling point component separating column 17 was operated at a<br>
column top pressure of atmospheric pressure, and a column bottom temperature of<br>
201 °C, thus carrying out an ether producing reaction between ethylene carbonate<br>
and ethylene glycol in the column bottom portion of the low boiling point component<br>
separating column 17, so as to convert into diethylene glycol (DEG). The residence<br>
time in the column bottom portion 26 of the low boiling point component separating<br>
column 17 was 1.5 hours. A gaseous component distilled off from the top of the low<br>
boiling point component separating column 17 was condensed using a condenser 19,<br>
and some of this component was refluxed back via a conduit 20, while the remainder<br>
was introduced via a conduit 21 into the top of a carbon dioxide-eliminating column<br>
22. The reflux ratio was 1. Nitrogen gas was introduced into the column 22 from a<br>
conduit 23 provided at the bottom of the column 22, so as to carry out bubbling.<br>
Carbon dioxide-containing nitrogen gas was discharged from a conduit 24 provided<br>
at the top of the column 22. A carbon dioxide-eliminated liquid was circulated from<br><br>
the conduit 23 provided at the bottom of the column 22 at a flow rate of 58.3 g / h<br>
back into the 20th stage of the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1.<br>
A column bottom liquid from the low boiling point component separating<br>
column 17 was heated using a reboiler 28, and was withdrawn at a flow rate of 141.7<br>
g / h from a conduit pipe 30 as an ether-produced reaction mixture [containing<br>
99.74 % by weight of EG, and 0.14 % by weight of DEG and other high boiling point<br>
impurities; EC not detected].<br>
The ether-produced reaction mixture was fed via the conduit 30 into a<br>
position 90 cm from the top of an EG purifying column 41 comprising a packed<br>
column type distillation column of inside diameter 2.5 cm and packed height 120 cm<br>
packed with Dixon packings (3φ) as packings.<br>
The EG purifying column 41 was operated at a column top pressure of 4000<br>
Pa (30 torr), and a column bottom temperature of 123.5 °C. A liquid distillate was<br>
obtained as a side withdrawn liquid at a flow rate of 139.6 g / h from a conduit 56<br>
provided in a position 50cm from the top of the EG purifying column 41. Moreover,<br>
some of a column top distillate from the EG purifying column 41 was refluxed via a<br>
condenser 45 and a conduit 47 back into the top 42 of the EG purifying column 41,<br>
and the remainder was withdrawn from a conduit 48. The reflux ratio was 2. A<br>
column bottom liquid (containing 45.2 % by weight of EG) was withdrawn from the<br>
bottom 43 of the EG purifying column 41, and some of this column bottom liquid was<br>
passed through a reboiler 50 and a conduit 51 and returned into the bottom 43 of the<br>
EG purifying column 41, while the remainder was withdrawn at 0.7 g / h via a conduit<br>
52.<br>
For the liquid EG withdrawn from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying<br>
column, the amount of other organic components was below the detection limit (1<br>
ppm for each component) according to gas chromatography, and the aldehyde<br><br>
concentration was measured using the colorimetric method to be 0.6 ppm.<br>
Moreover, the UV transmittance of this side withdrawn liquid at 220 nm was 89%.<br>
polyester was produced taking this EG and dimethyl terephthalate as starting<br>
materials and using antimony as a catalyst. The polyester obtained had a high<br>
optical transmittance in the UV and visible regions. The above results show that for<br>
the system overall, the DMC yield was 99.8%, and very high-purity EG was obtained<br>
at a yield of 99.1 %. <br>
Example 2:<br>
DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 1,<br>
except that as the catalyst, instead of the homogeneous catalyst comprising an<br>
ethylene glycol solution of potassium hydroxide, there was used an anion exchange<br>
resin having quaternary ammonium groups as exchange groups (obtained by<br>
subjecting a Dowex MSA-1 CI type to ion exchange with a 2N Na2CO3 aqueous<br>
solution, repeatedly washing with pure water, and then repeatedly washing with dry<br>
methanol, so as to carry out dehydration / drying, approximately 50% of the Cl~ ions<br>
being exchanged to CO32- ions), which was fixed to the 3rd to 40th stages of the tray<br>
portion (each approximately 5 vol% of the liquid residing portion) and the column<br>
bottom portion (approximately 10 vol% of the liquid residing portion) such as not to<br>
flow out. Here, the temperatures in the column were T1 = 80.4 °C and T2 = 98 °C,<br>
and the average residence times of the reaction liquids were θ1 =2.2 hours and θ2 =<br>
3.8 hours, the total average residence time being 6.0 hours. From these values, α +<br>
1.24β = 2460. The EC conversion for the transesterification reaction was 99.9%,<br>
the DMC selectivity was 99.8%, and the EG selectivity was 99.8%.<br>
Moreover, the amount of other organic components in the liquid EG<br>
withdrawn from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying column according to gas<br><br>
chromatography was below the detection limit (1 ppm), the aldehyde concentration<br>
according to the colorimetric method was 0.8 ppm, and the UV transmittance at 220<br>
nm was 88.5%. The DMC yield for the system overall was 99.7%, and the EG yield<br>
was 99.0%.<br>
Comparative Example 1:<br>
DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 1,<br>
except that the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was made to be an<br>
Oldershow distillation column having an inside diameter 2.5 cm and 10 stages, and<br>
the stage into which the EC and the catalyst were fed was made to be the 1st stage,<br>
while the stage into which the mixture of MeOH and DMC was fed was made to be<br>
the 5th stage. Here, the temperatures in the column were T1 (5th stage) = 79.2 °C<br>
and T2 = 95 °C, and the average residence times of the reaction liquids were 81 =<br>
0.18 hours and θ2 = 0.25 hours, the total average residence time being 0.43 hours.<br>
From these values, a + 1.24β = 615. The EC conversion for the transesterification<br>
reaction was 91%, the DMC selectivity was 85%, and the EG selectivity was 83%.<br>
Moreover, 1.8% of other organic components (mainly EC) was detected<br>
according to the gas chromatography analysis results on the liquid EG withdrawn<br>
from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying column.<br>
These results show that, because the residence time in the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 1 was insufficient, the transesterification reaction<br>
results were poor.	<br>
Comparative Example 2:<br>
DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 1,<br>
except that the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was made to be an<br><br>

stage into which the EC and the catalyst were fed was made to be the 5th stage,<br>
while the stage into which the mixture of MeOH and DMC was fed was made to be<br>
the 40th stage. Here, the temperatures in the column were T1 (42nd stage) = 80.8 °C<br>
and T2 = 97.5 °C, and the average residence times of the reaction liquids were θ1 =<br>
10.8 hours and θ2 = 21 hours, the total average residence time being 31.8 hours.<br>
From these values, α + 1.243 = 5853. The EC conversion for the transesterification<br>

withdrawn from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying column according to gas<br>
chromatography was 20 ppm, the aldehyde concentration according to the<br>
colorimetric method was 18 ppm, and the UV transmittance at 220 nm was 62%.<br>
These results show that, because the residence time in the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 1 was too long, aldehyde was produced in a large<br>
amount.<br>
Example 3:<br>
DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 1,<br>
except that the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was made to be an<br>
Oldershow distillation column having an inside diameter 4 cm and 80 stages, and the<br>
stage into which the EC and the catalyst were fed was made to be the 5th stage,<br>

and T2 = 98 °C, and the average residence times of the reaction liquids were 61 = 5.0<br>
hours and 02 = 11.2 hours, the total average residence time being 16.2 hours. From<br><br>
these values, a + 1.243 = 4126. The EC conversion for the transesterification<br>
reaction was 99.95%, the DMC selectivity was 99.8%, and the EG selectivity was<br>
99.8%.<br>
Moreover, the amount of other organic components in the liquid EG<br>
withdrawn from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying column according to gas<br>
chromatography was 2 ppm, the aldehyde concentration according to the colorimetric<br>
method was 1.6 ppm, and the UV transmittance at 220 nm was 87.5%. The DMC<br>
yield for the system overall was 99.7%, and the EG yield was 99.1%.<br>
Comparative Example 3:<br>
DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 3,<br>
except that the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was made to be a<br>
pressurized column, and the column top pressure was made to be 6.4x105 Pa.<br>
Here, the temperature at the top of the column was 120.8 °C, the temperatures in the<br>
column were T1 (42nd stage) = 132 °C and T2 = 152 °C, and the average residence<br>
times of the reaction liquids were θ1 = 5.1 hours and θ2 = 11.4 hours, the total<br>
average residence time being 16.5 hours. From these values, α + 1.24β = 5455.<br>
The EC conversion for the transesterification reaction was 99.97%, the DMC<br>
selectivity was 99.2%, and the EG selectivity was 99.1%.<br>
Moreover, the amount of other organic components in the liquid EG<br>
withdrawn from the side-cut outlet of the EG purifying column according to gas<br>
chromatography was 16 ppm, the aldehyde concentration according to the<br>
colorimetric method was 14 ppm, and the UV transmittance at 220 nm was 65%.<br>

DMC and EG were produced according to the same process as in Example 1,<br><br>
except that the continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was made to be an<br>
Oldershow distillation column having an inside diameter 2.5 cm and 30 stages, and<br>
the stage into which the EC and the catalyst were fed was made to be the 2nd stage,<br>
while the stage into which the mixture of MeOH and DMC was fed was made to be<br>
the 15th stage. Here, the temperatures in the column were T1 (16th stage) = 80.4 °C<br>
and T2 = 98 °C, and the average residence times of the reaction liquids were θ1 = 0.5<br>
hours and θ2 = 0.62 hours, the total average residence time being 1.12 hours. From<br>
these values, a + 1.24β = 1022. The EC conversion for the transesterification<br>
reaction was 99.4%, the DMC selectivity was 99.3%, and the EG selectivity was<br>
