Said invention makes it possible to substentially reduce the energy consumption by the slave nodes of a system and/or increase the range of action thereof. In order to encode each symbol of transmitted data, a random or pseudorandom set of differences of initial pairs of nearest harmonic pairs are used. Said difference sets of the initial phases are selected in such a way that the peak factor of an added signal is minimised. When a fire-alarm sensor is actuated, it is sufficient to transmit only one symbol to an alarm panel which, unambiguously identifies the location of the active sensor and as a rule is embodied in the form of a conventional number or address pre-allocated to said sensor.</td>

3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
173/MUMNP/2006<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to data collection over alternate current (ac) supply network and can be used for low-speed data acquisition from remote sensors of intrusion protection and fire alarm systems as well as from electric, water, heat, gas meters, etc <br>
Description of the related art<br>
It is known a communication system over ac supply network (U.S.Pat.No.5844949, Int.Cl. H04B 001/10; H04L 025/08; H03D 001/04, issued Dec. 1," 1998) which involves a transmitter sending a signal with geometric. harmonic modulation and a receiver for its reception and decoding. The main problem of the system in question is in the fact that it uses differential phase modulation (DPM) at each harmonic for the transmitted signal coding. This circumstance prevents information to be conveyed in energy-optimal way by small portions, for example one bit or one character at a time; because when DPM is utilized to transmit one bit or one character, it is necessary to send two signals at least, reference signal and intelligence one.<br>
It is also known a communication system through ac network (U.S.Pat.No.6329905, Int.Cl. H04M 011/04, issued March 23, 2000) with a transmitter sending a signal which comprises two harmonics with relative DPM, frequencies of the indicated harmonics being one half multiple of the network voltage reference frequency. The main problem of this system is its known low noise stability connected with the fact that for data transmission it uses a signal with energy concentrated only within two narrow regions so that the presence of repeatable interference at a frequency accidentally coinciding with one transmission frequency will make such a system completely inoperative. Besides, since the frequencies of the indicated harmonics differ essentially (by multiples of two and more), their differential phases at the reception point will fluctuate greatly and by random, accordingly   with   phase-frequency   characteristic   fluctuations   of   the   signal-<br>
2<br><br>
propagation medium, what will make signal decoding at the reception point impossible.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method of signal modulation oriented to data transmission by small portions (for example, by one bit) at large intervals, more energy-optimal than now known ones, which would provide data collection from numerous low-speed sensors coupled to the ac power network, for example sensors of intrusion protection and fire alarm systems, under most unfavourable conditions and in the presence of strong signal attenuation.<br>
The indicated technical result when the present invention is realized is achieved, in contrast to other known methods, by using as a modulation object a phase difference of signal adjacent harmonic components what, as compared to conventional DPM, makes it possible to reduce intelligence signal time by half with complete retention of the noise stability. Note that the indicated advantage will take place exclusively in transmission of small data portions, such as one bit or, in more general interpretation, one character at a time. In many practical cases it appears to be quite sufficient; thus, for example, when a fire alarm sensor comes into action, it will suffice to transmit to the alarm prevention terminal only one character uniquely identifying the location of the actuated sensor (such character, as a rule, is either a conditional number or agreed address assigned to the sensor in question in advance).<br>
Analysis of the engineering level carried out by the applicant, which involved an information search in patent, scientific and technical literature, in an attempt to reveal the sources containing information on the present invention, ascertains that the applicant has discovered no analogue with features identical to these of the present invention. So selection from the list of found analogues of the prototype as the closest by combination of features analogue has made it possible to reveal a set of important, with respect to the technical result expected by the applicant, distinguishing features in the claimed object stated in claims. To verify whether the present  invention  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  inventor"s  level,  an<br>
3<br><br>
additional search for known features coinciding with distinguishing features in the claimed prototype has been carried out. Its results show that the present invention for those skilled in the related art does not follow directly from the known engineering level because designs, wherein phase differences of numerous adjacent harmonic components are used for signal modulation, are not known.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The claimed method of geometric harmonic signal modulation is clarified by the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a system for data collection through ac network from numerous fire alarm sensors wherein the present method of modulation is used.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the principle of how to create time marks for primary (bit) synchronization.<br>
Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described with respect to a system of data collection from fire alarm sensors (Fig. 1) which comprises one main unit 1 and several slave units 2. All system units are electrically coupled to the same segment of power network 3. The internal structure of main unit is very similar to that of slave units and it includes the following elements: protection and signal coupling device 4, band-pass filters 5 and 6, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 7, digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 8, comparator with hysteresis 9, interrupt input 10. The distinction is in the fact that the system main unit is based on powerful digital signal processor 11 and phase tables 12, digital signal processor 11 having communication channel 13 with the outer world, whereas a simpler and cheaper slave unit is totally based on general-purpose microcontroller 14 and signal table 15, a primary fire alarm sensor, for example a smoke detector, being connected to microcontroller 14 via communication line 16. The system operating frequency range is 20 ... 95 kHz. A signal from a slave unit is transmitted within this range at 96 harmonics being evenly spaced, exactly at 781.25 Hz.<br>
4<br><br>
The data collection system operates in the following manner (Figs. 1,2). Comparators 9 pick out the moments when network voltage 18 becomes equal to zero 19, thus forming a sequence of time marks 20, practically synchronous for the whole system, which is used for primary (character) synchronization for data transmission from slave units to the main one. On operation of primary sensor 17 microcontroller 14 begins to play back periodically through DAC 8 its signal table which is stored in a non-volatile memory and is unique for each slave unit 2. The signal table playback time is equal exactly to one half-cycle of network voltage and the playback starting point is defined by the instant of comparator 9 operation which takes place when the network voltage in line 3 is equal to zero. A signal from DAC 8 output is further filtered by band-pass filter 6 to remove the out-of-band components and through protection and signal coupling device 4 is delivered to network line 3. Signal table 15 is unique for each slave unit 2. A set of signal tables has been synthesized before the network for data collection according to the present method is installed. A candidate-set of 96 numbers φk from the interval [0...27i] is generated by a random-number or pseudorandom number generator. This set is further used to synthesize a signal of the type<br><br>
where m=0...95, fm-96 harmonics evenly spaced at interval of 781.25 Hz    within the system operating frequency band (20.. .95 kHz). Signals s(t) with a good value of the crest factor and their phase sets are stored in table form for further use.    As practice shows, the probability that a signal to be synthesized from a given random set of 96 phase differences will have the crest factor being only 4 dB less than that of proper sine is rather high. In system installation various signal tables selected according to the aforesaid method are saved in each slave unit 2. Signal from a slave unit transmitter passes through a segment of power network 3 where noise is added to it. The signal is then attenuated, subjected to different kind of linear and nonlinear distortion and enters network main unit 1 where it passes through coupling device 4, band-pass filter 5 and is converted to digital form in ADC 6. Digital signal processor 11 stores all ADC samples of the given bit interval<br>
5<br><br>
and performs a Fourier transform on them. This   results   in  a   set of complex Fourier coefficients but only those 96 coefficients with frequencies fitting those on which a slave unit transmits its data are used further. In what follows denote them by Cm, where m = 0...95. At the next stage the following products are found:<br><br>
where - a corresponding phase set taken from phase tables 12<br>
which was used to generate a signal table for a given slave unit, k=l... 95, m=0... 95, asterisk denotes complex conjugation. Then for each slave unit an estimate as the following sum is calculated:<br><br>
These operations imply that products  are complex vectors with rotation<br>
angles being equal to phase differences of adjacent harmonics in the received signal, DK values are the same vectors rotated to the real axis through an angle exactly opposite to the angle used for modulation of these harmonics in a slave unit transmitter. Thus, if a "correct" signal from a slave unit is found in a given bit interval, its corresponding set of complex values Dk is being concentrated along the real axis and the sum Swill show a greater positive shift. If a given bit interval has no "correct" signal from a slave unit, the value S, as can be easily seen, will be a normally distributed random value with zero average deviation and standard deviation of about 10. Determination of the signal from a given slave unit is completed by comparing the sum S with some predetermined and rather high threshold.<br>
Compared to known methods of geometric modulation the described signal has an effective duration reduced by one half, what allows power consumption of a slave unit to be reduced likewise with simultaneous retention of all noise stability characteristics of the system.<br>
6<br><br>
Industrial applicability The above information therefore testifies that the following set of conditions is fulfilled with electric network communications and more particularly in systems for data collection from remote sensors:<br>
-	a possibility of realization of the present invention, as it is characterized in<br>
claims, is confirmed by means and methods either cited above or already<br>
known before the priority date of the application;<br>
-	a means embodying the present invention is capable, when realized, of<br>
.   providing the technical result expected by the applicant.<br>
7<br><br>
We Claim<br>
1. A method of geometric harmonic modulation of a signal comprising a plurality of harmonics evenly spaced in frequencies, wherein a unique random or pseudo-random set of initial phase differences for the nearest pairs of said harmonics is used to encode each character of transmitted data and said sets of initial phase differences are selected in such a way as to minimize the crest factor of total signal.<br>
