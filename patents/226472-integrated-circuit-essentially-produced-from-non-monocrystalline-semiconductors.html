Description<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated circuit<br>
which is essentially produced from organic<br>
semiconductors.<br>
It is known to produce integrated circuits from organic<br>
semiconductors. On account of the properties of the<br>
organic semiconductors, however, it is not possible to<br>
transfer all the elements of integrated circuits that<br>
are known from CMOS technology to circuits made of<br>
organic semiconductors. For this reason, complicated<br>
equivalent circuits are used. However, the latter have<br>
the disadvantage that the complexity of the circuit is<br>
increased and the propagation time delay thus<br>
increases. A supply voltage that is often more than<br>
twice as high as in the case of CMOS circuits is<br>
furthermore required. Moreover, the: speed is limited by<br>
the small current of the first load transistor, which<br>
charges the gate of the last driver transistor.<br>
Finally, a static power consumption has also been<br>
observed and the noise sensitivity is increased.<br>
For this reason, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an integrated circuit made of<br>
organic semiconductors which has a simple construction.<br>
This object is achieved by means of an integrated<br>
circuit having the features specified in claim 1.<br>
Preferred embodiments are contained in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
The invention provides an integrated circuit which is<br>
essentially produced from non-monocrystalline<br>
semiconductors, comprising:<br>
a multiplicity of transistors, all of the<br>
transistors being of the same type;<br>
at least two timer signal inputs or clock inputs,<br>
the timer signals or clock signals fed to the different<br>
inputs being temporally non-overlapping signals.<br>
Electrical functionality and substrate function are<br>
coupled inseparably in the case of electronics made of<br>
monocrystalline semiconductors (Si, GaAs, InP) . In the<br>
case of non-monocrystalline semiconductors, the<br>
electrical functionality is decoupled from the carrier<br>
material. This means that non-monocrystalline<br>
semiconductors can be applied on any desired carrier<br>
and electrical functionality can be integrated there.<br>
The non-overlapping timer signals are configured in<br>
such a way that only one of the signals ever outputs a<br>
pulse in each case at a specific point in time.<br>
The integrated circuit is thus operated by means of a<br>
so called multiphase logic.<br>
Preferably, the integrated circuit furthermore<br>
comprises at least one supply voltage contact for<br>
feeding in a supply voltage and at least one signal<br>
output for outputting an output signal, the magnitude<br>
of the supply voltage to be fed essentially being equal<br>
to the voltage required for the output signal.<br>
Preferably, all of the transistors are p-channel<br>
transistors.<br>
Preferably, the circuit furthermore comprises at least<br>
one capacitor for buffer-storing signals. The elements<br>
of the integrated circuit thus form a dynamic logic<br>
circuit. The capacitor is preferably used as a signal<br>
buffer store for momentarily storing internal signals<br>
cf the integrated circuit. The storage duration is<br>
preferably a few nsec to msec. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the semiconductors are organic<br>
semiconductors. Preferably, the organic semiconductors<br>
are molecular semiconductors, preferably<br>
phthalocyanine, oligothiophene or pentacene.<br>
As an alternative, the organic semiconductors may be<br>
polymer semiconductors, preferably polythiophene.<br>
In a further third embodiment, the semiconductors are<br>
inorganic semiconductors, which are preferably<br>
surface-functionalized. Such semiconductors are<br>
preferably surface-functionalized "nanoparticles" of<br>
inorganic nature such as e.g. CdSe, Si, GaAs, ZnO, TiO2<br>
ruthenium oxides, etc.<br>
The integrated circuit preferably forms a NOR gate.<br>
n one preferred embodiment, the integrated circuit<br>
comprises:<br>
a first to fourth transistor each having a gate<br>
terminal, a source terminal and a drain terminal;<br>
- a first and second capacitor;<br>
- a resistor;<br>
- a first and a second timer signal input;<br>
- a first and a second signal input;<br>
- the gate terminal of the first transistor being<br>
signal-connected to the first timer signal input via<br>
the first capacitor and to the supply voltage terminal<br>
via the resistor;<br>
-the source terminal of the first transistor being<br>
signal-connected to the supply voltage terminal;<br>
- the drain terminal of: the first transistor, the<br>
source terminal of the third transistor, the source<br>
terminal of the fourth transistor and the signal output<br>
being signal-connected to one another;<br>
- the drain terminal of the first transistor being<br>
grounded via the second capacitor; and<br>
- the first signal input being signal-connected to<br>
the gate terminal of the third transistor;<br>
- the second signal input being signal-connected to<br>
the gate terminal of the fourth transistor;<br>
- the drain terminal of the third transistor, the<br>
drain terminal of the fourth transistor and the source<br>
terminal of the second transistor being<br>
signal-connected to one another;<br>
- the gate terminal of the second transistor being<br>
signal-connected to the second timer signal input;<br>
- the drain terminal of the second transistor being<br>
grounded.<br>
Further features (objects and advantages of the present<br>
invention) will become apparent from the description of<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention with<br>
reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows part of an integrated circuit in<br>
accordance with a first preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention; and<br>
figure 2 shows part of a circuit of an integrated<br>
circuit in accordance with a second preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Two preferred embodiments of the invention which are<br>
produced from essentially organic semiconductors are<br>
descrioed with reference to the figures. Further<br>
semiconductors which may be used according to the<br>
invention are specified after the following<br>
description.<br>
A first preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
is described in detail below with reference to<br>
figure 1. Firstly, the construction of the circuit in<br>
accordance with the first preferred embodiment is<br>
described with reference to figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows the realization of a NOR gate based on a<br>
dynamic logic. Four p-channel transistors T1, T2 , T3<br>
and T4 are provided in the circuit shown in figure 1.<br>
The four transistors each have a gate terminal Gl, G2,<br>
G3 G4, a source terminal S1, S2, S3, S4 and a drain<br>
terminal D1, D2, D3, D4 . Two capacitors C1, C2 and a<br>
resistor R1 are furthermore provided in the circuit.<br>
Two non-overlapping timer signals are fed to the<br>
circuit via two timer signal inputs 1, 2.<br>
Non-overlapping signals are in this case to be<br>
understood as signals in the case of which only one of<br>
the signals has a pulse at a specific point in time.<br>
This means, in particular, that at a specific point in<br>
time only the circuit part that is signal-connected to<br>
the respective timer signal input receives a clock<br>
pulse. Consequently, two clock signals or a two-phase<br>
logic is present.<br>
Furthermore, the circuit has two signal inputs A, B, a<br>
signal output Q and a supply voltage terminal V1.<br>
The gate terminal Gl of the first transistor T1 is<br>
signal connected to the first timer signal input 1 via<br>
the first capacitor C1 and to the supply voltage<br>
terminal V1 via the resistor R1. The source terminal S1<br>
of the first transistor T1 is preferably<br>
signal - connected directly to the supply voltage<br>
terminal V1. Furthermore, the drain terminal D1 of the<br>
first transistor T1, the source terminal S3 of the<br>
third transistor T3, the source terminal S4 of the<br>
fourth transistor T4 and the signal output Q are<br>
signal-connected to one another. The: drain terminal D1<br>
of the first transistor T1 is grounded via the second<br>
capacitor C2.<br>
The first signal input A is signal-connected to the<br>
gate terminal G3 of the third transistor T3. The second<br>
signal input B is signal-connected to the gate terminal<br>
G4 of the fourth transistor T4.<br>
The drain terminal D3 of the third transistor T3, the<br>
drain terminal D4 of the fourth transistor T4 and the<br>
source terminal S2 of the second transistor T2 are<br>
signal-connected to one smother.<br>
The gate terminal G2 of the second transistor T2 is<br>
signal-connected to the second timer signal input 2.<br>
Furthermore, the drain terminal D2 of the second<br>
transistor T2 is grounded.<br>
The operation of the circuit shown in Figure 1 is<br>
described below.<br>
By means of a pulse at the first timer signal input 1,<br>
the first transistor T1 is turned on, as a result of<br>
which the capacitance 2 is precharged to the supply-<br>
voltage VDD. In the case of a subsequent pulse at the<br>
second timer signal input 2, the second transistor T2<br>
is turned on. If a high signal or "1" or the supply<br>
voltage VDD is present at the first signal input A, the<br>
third transistor T3 is turned on, the capacitance C2<br>
being discharged. The output signal which is then<br>
present at the signal output Q is consequently "low" or<br>
"0" or the voltage VSS corresponding to the grounding.<br>
If a high signal or the supply voltage VDD is present<br>
at the second signal input B, the fourth transistor T4<br>
is turned on and the capacitance C2 is likewise<br>
discharged. As a consequence, the output signal present<br>
at the signal output Q is likewise "0" or low. The<br>
above likewise holds true if a high signal is present<br>
Doth at the first signal input A and at the second<br>
signal input B.<br>
It is only in the case if a low signal or "0" is<br>
present both at the first signal input A and at the<br>
second signal input B that the capacitor C2 is not<br>
discharged and the signal present at the signal output<br>
Q is equal to VDD or "1". Consequently, a NOR gate with<br>
a dynamic circuit logic is formed by the circuit<br>
illustrated in figure 1 with the aid of the multiphase<br>
logic.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
is described below with reference to figure 2.<br>
The circuit shown in figure 2 comprises six p-channel<br>
transistors T4-T9 and four capacitors C3 to C6. Two<br>
timer signal inputs 1 and 2, a signal input IN and a<br>
signal output OUT are furthermore provided.<br>
The construction of the circuit in accordance with the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
in detail below with reference to figure 2.<br>
The first timer signal input 1 is signal-connected to<br>
the gate terminal G4 of the transistor T4 and the gate<br>
terminal G5 of the transistor T5. Furthermore, the<br>
source terminal S4 of the transistor T4 is connected to<br>
the supply voltage VDD. The drain terminal D4 of the<br>
transistor T4 is signal-connected to an intermediate<br>
signal output Z and the source terminal S6 of the<br>
transistor T6.<br>
The source terminal S5 of the transistor T5 is<br>
signal connected to the signal input IN and the drain<br>
terminal D5 of the transistor T5 is signal-connected to<br>
the gate terminal G6 of the transistor T6 and the<br>
capacit or C3. The second terminal of the capacitor C3<br>
is grounded. The drain terminal D6 of the transistor T6<br>
is likewise grounded.<br>
The second timer signal input 2 is signal-connected to<br>
the gate terminal G7 of the transistor T7 and the gate<br>
terminal G8 of the transistor T8. The source terminal<br>
S7 of the transistor T7 is connected to the supply<br>
voltage VDD. The drain terminal D7 of the transistor T7<br>
is signal-connected to the signal output OUT, the<br>
source terminal S9 of the transistor T9 and a capacitor<br>
C6. The second terminal of the capacitor C6 is<br>
grounded. The source terminal S8 of the transistor T8<br>
is signal-connected to the intermediate signal output Z<br>
and a capacitor C4. The second terminal of the<br>
capacitor C4 is grounded. The drain terminal D8 of the<br>
transistor T8 is signal-connected to the gate terminal<br>
G9 of the transistor T9 and a capacitor C5. The second<br>
terminal of the capacitor C5 is grounded. The drain<br>
terminal D9 of the transistor T9 is likewise grounded.<br>
The operation of the circuit described above is<br>
iescribed below.<br>
A pulse present at the first timer signal input 1<br>
turns the transistors T4 and T5 on. Consequently, the<br>
input signal present at the signal input IN is present<br>
at the gate terminal G6 of the transistor T6. The<br>
transistor T6 is or is not turned on depending on the<br>
input signal. If the input signal is a high signal or<br>
1", the transistor T6 is turned on and a low signal or<br>
0" is present at the intermediate signal output Z. If,<br>
by contrast, the input signal is a low signal, the<br>
transistor T6 remains in its off state and a high<br>
signal is present at the intermediate signal output.<br>
Consequently, the inverse of the input signal is always<br>
present at the intermediate signal output A1.<br>
The capacitor C4 is charged by the signal present at<br>
the intermediate signal output Z. Consequently, the<br>
signal present at the intermediate signal output Z can<br>
be stored by the capacitor C4 for a short time. If a<br>
pulse is present at the second timer signal input 2,<br>
the transistors T7 and T8 are turned on. The transistor<br>
T9 is or is not turned on depending on the intermediate<br>
signal present at the intermediate signal output Z. If<br>
a high signal is present at the intermediate signal<br>
output Z, the transistor T9 is turned on and the output<br>
signal present at the signal output OUT becomes low or<br>
"0". If, by contrast, a low signal is present at the<br>
intermediate signal output Al, the transistor T9<br>
remains in the off state and a high signal or "1" is<br>
present at the signal output OUT. Consequently, the<br>
output signal present at the signal output OUT is an<br>
inverse of the intermediate output signal or equal to<br>
the irput signal that had been applied at the signal<br>
input IN at the start of the cycle or the phase.<br>
Consequently, a phase shifter can be realized by the<br>
circuit illustrated in figure 2.<br>
The capacitors used in the circuits illustrated can<br>
store a signal for a short time period. A dynamic logic<br>
circuit with a multiphase operation is thus formed.<br>
With the aid of the integrated circuit according to the<br>
invention, preferably made of organic semiconductors,<br>
circuits having only one type of transistor can be<br>
realized in a simple manner. In particular, it is<br>
possible to realize circuits which have only p-channel<br>
transistors and nevertheless have a low complexity and<br>
minor requirements made of the supply voltage.<br>
Transistors which would be n-channel transistors in a<br>
complenentary logic may preferably be replaced by a<br>
capacitively coupled p-channel transistor, the gate<br>
voltage preferably being capacitively coupled.<br>
Consequently, a dynamic multiphase logic is preferably<br>
realized.<br>
In the circuit arrangement according to the invention,<br>
the magnitude of the supply voltage is limited only by<br>
the gate-source voltage required for the output signal<br>
or the magnitude of the gate-source voltage required<br>
for the output signal.<br>
The organic semiconductors used are preferably low<br>
molecular weight or polymeric semiconductors. Organic<br>
semiconductors which are used in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention are described in<br>
the publication "Polymer Gate Dielectric Pentacene TFTs<br>
and Circuits on Flexible Substrates" by H. Klauk,<br>

Meeting Technical Digest, pages 557 560, December 2002,<br>
which, with regard to the semiconductors used, is<br>
regarded as being disclosed herein to the extent of its<br>
entire contents. One preferred organic semiconductor of<br>
polymeric nature is e.g. polythiophene. Further<br>
^referred polymers are regioregular<br>
poly(3-alkyl)thiophenes, preferred alkyl groups (hexyl,<br>
octyl), polyvinylthiophenes, polypyrroles and<br>
lerivatives thereof.<br>
Preferred low molecular weight organic semiconductors<br>
are e.g. phthalocyanine, anthracene, tetracene,<br>
pentacene, oligothiophenes (substituted,<br>
insubstituted) , for example a, ?<br>
bis-decylsexiothiophene, naphthalenetetracarboxylic<br>
dianhydride, naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide and its<br>
derivatives.<br>
n the sense of this application, organometallic<br>
semiconductors are understood to be organic<br>
semiconductors. Preferred organometallic semiconductors<br>
are Cu-phthalocyanine, perfluoro-cu-phthalo-cyanine,<br>
metal porphyrin derivatives, (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4,<br>
derivatives of Magnus salts [Pt(NH3)4][PtCl4]for<br>
example [Pt(NH2democ)4][PtCl4]. Organometallic<br>
semiconductors which are used in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention are described in<br>
the publications "(Hot-)Waterproof", Semiconducting,<br>
Platinum-based Chain Structures: Processing, Products,<br>
and Properties" by W.R. Caseri et al. , published in<br>
Advanced Materials 2003, 15, No. 2, January 16, pp.<br>
125-129 and "Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Materials as<br>

Transistors" by C.R. Kagan et al. , published in<br>
Science, Vol. 286, October 29, 1999, pages 945-947,<br>
which, with regard to the semiconductors used, are<br>
regarded as disclosed herein in terms of the entire<br>
contents.<br>
Further preferred semiconductors in the sense of this<br>
application are optionally surface-functionalized, non-<br>
monocrystalline semiconductors, such as nano-CdSe or<br>
nano-Si .<br>
Non-monocrystalline semiconductors, particularly<br>
preferably organic semiconductors, are used for the<br>
present invention. The decoupling between electrical<br>
functionality and carrier material is important in this<br>
case. In contrast to this, carrier material and<br>
electrical functionality are inseparably linked in the<br>
case of monocrystalline semiconductors. Preferably, the<br>
semiconductors used can be deposited in principle on<br>
any substrate (plastic films, paper, etc.). The thus<br>
newly acquired flexibility in choice of substrate,<br>
production technology and applicability affords new<br>
advantages.<br>

the second timer signal input (2);<br>
- the drain terminal (D2) of the second transistor (T2) being grounded.<br>
An integrated circuit which is essentially produced from non-monocrystalline<br>
semiconductors, comprising:<br>
- a multiplicity of transistors (T1 - T4), all of the transistors being of the same<br>
type;<br>
- at least two timer signal inputs (1,2), the timer signals fed to the different<br>
inputs (1,2) being temporally non-overlapping signals;<br>
- one supply voltage contact for feeding in a supply voltage (Vdd) and<br>
- at least one signal output (Q) for outputting an output signal, the magnitude of<br>
the supply voltage (Vdd) to be fed essentially being equal to the voltage required for<br>
the output signal (Q); and<br>
- at least one capacitance,<br>
wherein the integrated circuit is designed such that by means of a pulse at a<br>
first timer signal input (1) of the at least two timer signal inputs (1,2), a first<br>
transistor (T1) of the multiplicity of transistors (T1-T4) is turned on, as a result of<br>
which a capacitance (C2) of the at least one capacitance is used for buffer-storing a<br>
signal, whereby a dynamic multiphase logic is formed.</td>
