Assay for detection of transient intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup>+<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to detection and quantification of transient changes in intracellular metabolites by making use of a resulting protein-protein interaction that is irreversible and longlasting.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Increase in concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ions is a widely used signaling mechanism under various physiological conditions. Release of free Ca2+ ions inside the cell happens either through plasma membrane channel proteins that allow Ca2+ influx or by release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Since Ca2+ release thus becomes the activity of a wide variety of proteins, methods for detection and measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ are used as assays for many proteins that are potential drug targets. These methods should be capable of sensing the transient rise in intracellular [Ca2+] and also of generating a detectable signal.<br>
Most of the commonly used methods for Ca2+ sensing use molecules that exhibit changes in their fluorescence characteristics upon exposure to increase in [Ca2+]. These include small molecular weight macromolecules such as fura-2, indo-1, fluo-3, and Cafcium-Green (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,209 and 5,049,673) as well as proteins such as GFP (green fluorescent protein) family of proteins with a sensor peptide inserted within them (U.S. Pat. No. 6,469,154) or the cameleon molecules of tandem GFP constructs with an intervening Ca2+ sensing peptide sequence, that generate a FRET signal upon sensing free Ca2+ (U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,204). In all these methods, the fluorescence signal is also as short-lived as the Ca2+-transient, and hence signal acquisition in real¬time is mandatory. Moreover this also imposes rapid liquid dispensing. These factors not only necessitates the use of more expensive equipments but also limits the choice of equipments that can be used in<br><br>
addition to imposing severe constraints for carrying out these assays at high throughput scale. U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,709 disclosed a method that prolongs the duration of the Ca2+-transients by incorporating an intracellular chelator that alters the kinetics of signal generation, so that the signal is prolonged. However in all these methods, measurements will have to be done on cells in the live condition.<br>

The other object is to develop a Ca2+ sensing assay with broad applicability to many Ca2+ channel proteins<br>
Another object is to detect intracellular Ca2+ transients using a simple method wherein the need for realtime measurements on live cells is avoided.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an assay for detecting intracellular binding between two proteins. The assay is useful for detecting intracellular release of free Ca2+. In this assay method the transient Ca2+ signal is captured by an irreversible protein-protein interaction so that the signal is converted into a form that can be preserved for days to even months. There is absolutely no requirement of any real time signal acquisition or live cell signal acquisition.<br>
Increase in concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ions is a widely used signaling mechanism under various physiological conditions. Release of free Ca2+ ions inside the cell happens either through plasma membrane channel proteins that allow Ca2+ influx or by release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Since Ca2+ release thus becomes the activity of a wide variety of proteins, methods for detection and measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ are used as assays for many proteins that are potential drug targets. These methods should be capable of sensing the transient rise in intracellular [Ca2+] and also of generating a detectable signal.<br>
Most of the commonly used methods for Ca2+ sensing use molecules that exhibit changes in their fluorescence characteristics upon exposure to increase in [Ca2+]. These include small molecular weight macromolecules such as fura-2, indo-1, fluo-3, and Ca/cium-Green (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,209 and 5,049,673) as well as proteins such as GFP (green<br><br>
fluorescent protein) family of proteins with a sensor peptide inserted within them (U.S. Pat. No. 6,469,154) or the cameleon molecules of tandem GFP constructs with an intervening Ca2+ sensing peptide sequence, that generate a FRET signal upon sensing free Ca2+ (U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,204). In all these existing methods, the fluorescence signal is also as short-lived as the Ca2+-transient, and hence signal acquisition in real-time is mandatory. This requires sophisticated equipments with increased temporal resolution and capability for real time measurements from live cells. Moreover this also imposes rapid liquid dispensing. Consequently the cost of instrumentation becomes significantly high as well as the choice of equipments that can be used becomes limited. In addition severe constraints are imposed for carrying out these assays at high throughput scale. U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,709 disclosed a method that prolongs the duration of the Ca2+-transients by incorporating an intracellular chelator that alters the kinetics of signal generation, so that the signal is prolonged. Even then, measurements will have to be done on cells in the live condition.<br>
Ca2+/ calmodulin dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) present at neuronal synapses, upon activation by increase in intracellular Ca2+, gets translocated to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor and binds irreversibly by its T-site (the Thr286-binding site) to the NR2B subunit of the receptor. A GFP-fusion of CaMKII (GFP-CaMKII) and a fusion of the binding sequence on NR2B with a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MLS-NR2B) upon co-transfection in HEK-293 cells, bind to each other in response to increase in intracellular Ca2+. GFP-CaMKII present in the cytosol translocates to mitochondria, where it binds to MLS-NR2B. Figure 1 depicts schematically the appearance of punctae of green fluorescence in cells which had a uniform distribution of green fluorescence before stimulation with Ca2+. To demonstrate this phenomenon, intracellular Ca2+ influx was generated by adding the ionophore, ionomycin, which binds to the cell membrane and forms pores through which extracellular<br><br>
Ca2+ flows in. This is a combination of two published methods (Strack, S., McNeill, R. B., and Colbran, R. J., 2000, J Biol Chem 275, 23798-23806; Bayer, K. U., LeBel, E., McDonald, G. L., CLeary, H., Schulman, H. and De Koninck, P., 2006, J. Neurosci. Vol. 26, pi 164-1174) but is not identical to either.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the percentage of green cells that formed green punctae increases with increase in concentration of extracellular Ca2+ provided. At higher concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, more cells formed green punctae. Since extracellular concentration of Ca2+ is related to the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ levels in the system, it is possible to quantitate intracellular free Ca2+ concentration.<br>
Since the signal from fluorescent Ca2+-sensing dyes is also as short lived as the increased Ca2+ levels, the commonly used methods require sophisticated equipments with increased temporal resolution and capability for real time measurements from live cells. This not only necessitates the use of more expensive equipments but also limits the choice of equipments that can be used. For example in case of fluorescence microscope, only inverted microscope could be used. On the contrary, the interaction between CaMKII and NR2B is irreversible and hence produces a stable signal corresponding to a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ thereby eliminating the necessity for real time measurements. After completing the experiment on cover slips in multi well cell culture plates, the cells can be fixed and mounted on slides and can be viewed in an upright or inverted fluorescence microscope. Since the method disclosed in the present invention is not dependent on real time data acquisition techniques it is useful in drug discovery program by adapting it for high throughput screening for compounds that inhibit proteins which cause increase in intracellular [Ca2+] such as Ca2+-channel proteins. Moreover, the method disclosed in the present invention could enable many more laboratories with lesser<br><br>
instrumentation, to take up investigations on events and proteins that cause increase in intracellular [Ca2+].<br>

R., Cheriyan J., Mayadevi M., Srinivasan N. and Omkumar R. V., 2004, BiochemJ, 378, 391-397).<br>
MLS-NR2B was constructed in the vector pSGH, obtained as gift from Dr. Stefan Strack, Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, USA (Strack, S., McNeill, R. B., and Colbran, R. J, (2000) J Biol Chem 275, 23798-23806) using the cDNA of NR2B obtained as a gift from Prof. S. Nakanishi, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Department of Biological Sciences, Kyoto, JAPAN. The cDNA encoding NR2A also was a gift from Prof. S. Nakanishi, Department of Biological Sciences, Kyoto University, JAPAN. The mammalian expression vectors for NR1 (pRc-NRl), NR2A and NR2B (pRK-NR2A and pRK-NR2B) were gifts from Dr. David Lynch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, USA. The cDNA of vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1), also known as TRPV1 (Caterina et al., 1997, Nature, Vol. 389, p816-824) was a provided by Dr. David Julius, Department of Physiology, University of California San Fransisco, San Fransisco, CA 94158-2517, USA. The cDNA of glutamate receptor, was provided by Prof. Peter Seeberg, Department of Molecular Neurobiology, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.<br>
Experimental procedures<br>
Generation of expression constructs for the fusion proteins having the phosphorylation sites on NR2A or NR2B, conjugated to mitochondrial localizing signal sequence<br><br>
The cDNAs of NR2A (encoding amino acid residues 1265-1301) or NR2B (encoding amino acid residues 1271-1311) harboring the phosphorylation site for CaMKII (Ser12*1 and Servos 0f NR2A and NR2B respectively) present between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pGEX-2T-NR2A or pGEX-2T-NR2B vectors (Praseeda, M., Mayadevi, M., and Omkumar, R. V., 2004, Biochem.Biophys.Res.Commun. 313, 845-849) were subcloned into the pSGH vector. The sequences of NR2A and NR2B form parts of fusion proteins with a mitochondrial targeting signal sequence, a myc-epitope and GST at the N-terminal end (MLS-NR2A or MLS-NR2B). The sequences of the fusion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the NR2A or NR2B segments.<br>
Generation of mammalian expression constructs of a-CaMKII<br>
The cDNA of a-CaMKII was amplified by PCR from pGEM2a (Praseeda M., Pradeep K. K., Krupa A., Krishna S. S., Leena S., Kumar R. R., Cheriyan J., Mayadevi M., Srinivasan N. and Omkumar R. V., 2004, Biochem J, 378, 391-397) using forward primer having nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and reverse primer having nucleotide sequence as set for the in SEQ ID NO: 2 to yield a PCR product with Kpnl and BamHI sites at 5' and 3' ends respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-Cl vector (Clontech) using the corresponding restriction sites in the multiple cloning site of the vector, which resulted in an N-terminal GFP-fusion of a-CaMKII (GFP-a-CaMKII).<br>
5'-CGGGGTACCATGGCTACCATCACCTGC-3'	SEQ ID NO: 1<br>
5'-CGCGGATCCCTATCAATGGGGCAGGACGG-3'	SEQ ID NO: 2<br><br>
Site-Directed Mutagenesis<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene based on Kunkel's method (Kunkel, T. A., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 488-492). The cDNA of a-CaMKII present in the expression vector pEGFP-Cl-a-CaMKII served as the template to generate mutants. The NR2A or NR2B sequences present in the pSGH-NR2A or pSGH-NR2B expression vectors were also used as templates to generate mutants.<br>
Transfection, Ca2+-stimulation and imaging<br>
HEK-293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells were cultured as monolayer in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 ng/ml, fungizone 2.5 p.g/ml) at 37°C in a humid atmosphere having 5% CO2.<br>
For transfection, 1.5 x 104 HEK-293 cells were seeded on sterile 12 mm cover slips in 24 well plates (Nunc). After 24 hrs, the cells were cotransfected with plasmid constructs encoding GFP-ot-CaMKII (0.1 Hg/well) and either of MLS-NR2A or MLS-NR2B (0.25 ng/well), or pRK-NR2A or pRK-NR2B (along with pRc-NRl for expression of functional NMDA receptor) using Lipofectamine reagent. About 48 hrs following transfection, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 20 mM HEPES and 1.4 mM EGTA. The cells were then incubated with 15 \xM ionomycin in the same buffer for 10 min. Subsequently the cells were incubated in the same buffer containing 2 mM CaCb and 3 ^M ionomycin. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.8 mM potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, 140 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, pH adjusted to 7.4) at different time points after addition of calcium, mounted with mountant containing DABCO (antifade) and were observed through<br><br>
either a simple fluorescence microscope or a confocal fluorescence microscope (TCS-SP2-AOBS from Leica). Appearance of perinuclear granules due to mitochondrial localization of GFP-a-CaMKII is taken as the signal for binding between GFP-a-CaMKII and MLS-NR2B. In case of binding between GFP-a-CaMKII and full-length NR2B, accumulation of GFP-fluorescence in the membraneous structures such as nuclear membrane, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, plasma membrane, etc is taken as signal for binding. Data presented are for cells fixed immediately after incubation with 15 (xM ionomycin (-Ca2+ influx) or 2-5 minutes after Ca2+ stimulus (+Ca2+ influx). The total number of green fluorescent cells and cells which develop the signal for binding were counted manually for each microscopic field. Number of cells that develop signal for binding is represented as percentage of total number of green fluorescent cells (number of green fluorescent cells which develop signal for binding + number of green fluorescent cells which do not develop signal) in a field. Average for at least three separate fields was obtained for each experiment. Mean+standard deviation of data obtained from three such experiments is presented as values in inset in Figure 2. Wherever images for lack of binding are presented, no cell was found to develop the perinuclear granules in repeated experiments and hence no quantitation data is presented.<br>
NMDA receptor activity assay<br>
For expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR), the cells were cotransfected with plasmid constructs encoding GFP-a-CaMKII (0.1 ug/well) and NR1 (pRc-NRl plasmid) and NR2B (pRK-NR2B plasmid) subunits of NMDAR (0.33 ug/well of pRc-NRl and pRK-NR2B) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). When growth medium was added to the cells, it was supplemented with an inhibitor of NMDA receptor, either 1 mM of 2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid (AP-5) or 10 ^M MK-801. For detecting activity of NMDAR, about 48 hrs following transfection, cells were<br><br>
washed twice with Ca2+ and Mg2+ free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). The cells were then incubated with HBSS solution containing glutamate (10 uM) and glycine (2 uM), with or without CaCb (2 mM) for about 5 minutes. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for about 10 to 15 minutes and were washed thrice with PBS. The fixed cells were mounted onto glass slides<br>
In experiments with NMDAR containing NR2A subunit, cells were co-transfected with plasmid constructs encoding GFP-a-CaMKII (0.1 ug/well) and NR1 (pRc-NRl plasmid) and NR2A (pRK-NR2A plasmid) subunits of NMDAR (0.33 ug/well of pRc-NRl and pRK-NR2A) along with MLS-NR2B (0.33 ug/well of pSGH-NR2B) and growth medium was not supplemented with AP-5. NMDAR activity was detected as described in the previous section.<br>
TRFV1 receptor activity assay<br>
For the expression of TRPV1, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with TRPV1 (pCDNA3-TRPVl, about 0.2 ug/well), MLS-NR2B (pSGH-MLS-NR2B, about 0.33 ug/well) and GFP-CaMKII (pEGFP-CaMKII, about 0.1 ug/well) using lipofectamine reagent. After 48 hours, the transfected cells were subjected to TRPV1 activity assay. The growth medium was removed and the cells were washed with Ca2+ and Mg free HBSS containing 400 uM EGTA. The receptor was activated with 3 uM or 10 nM of capsaicin with 2 mM Ca2+ in HBSS without Mg2+ for 5 minutes. Control without Ca2+ during activation was also performed. The inhibitor of TRPV1 receptor, capsazepine (50 DM), when used, was preincubated for 3 minutes with cells in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS followed by activation using the components as described above with 50 uM capsazepine. Cells were then fixed and were mounted onto glass slides.<br><br>
GluR4 receptor activity assay<br>
HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with GluR4 (pRK5-GluR4, about 0.33 ug/well), MLS-NR2B (pSGH-MLS-NR2B, about 0.33 ug/well) and GFP-CaMKII (pEGFP-CaMKII, about 0.1 ug/well) using lipofectamine reagent. During growth, the medium was supplemented with 50 uM CNQX (inhibitor of AMPA receptor). After 48 hours, the transfected cells were subjected to GluR4 activity assay. The growth medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with Ca2+ and Mg free HBSS containing 2 mM HEPES and 400 uM EGTA. The GluR4 receptor was activated with HBSS solution containing 10 uM glutamate with or without 2 mM Ca2+ for about 5 minutes. The inhibitor, CNQX (50 uM), when used, was preincubated for 3 minutes with cells in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS followed by activation using the components as described above with 50 uM CNQX. Cells were then fixed and were mounted onto glass slides.<br>
Basic system for detection of intracellular Ca2+-release<br>
The system described in Figure 1 was imaged by confocal and non-confocal fluorescence microscopes and the images are presened in Figure 2. The arrows in the Plus-Ca2+ images indicate the cells which develop punctate appearance due to mitochondrial localization of GFP-a-CaMKII, consequent to intracellular rise in [Ca2+]. Quantification of cell count carried out as described in Figure 4 is shown in the confocal Plus-Ca2+ image.<br>
Development of Ca2+-dependent signals by using full-length NR2B instead of MLS-NR2B<br>
The data in Figure 3 is obtained by transfecting cells with full-length NR2B instead of MLS-NR2B. Since full length NR2B is localized to nuclear and other intracellular membranes, GFP-CaMKII localizes to those membraneous structures instead of mitochondria, upon sensing increase in intracellular [Ca2+].<br><br>
Quantitation of the intracellular Ca2+-dependent signal<br>
The inventors have found that the number of cells that develop the GFP-clustering signal is dependent on the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ and hence the intracellular Ca2+ (Figure 6). It also depends on the efficiency of the binding between CaMKII and NR2B (Figure 5). The inventors developed a method to express quantitatively the strength of the signal as mentioned in Methods section (Methodology for Transfection, Ca2+-stimulation and imaging). Data in Figure 4 is used to demonstrate this method.<br>
In image 1 of Figure 4, there are totally 11 cells expressing GFP of which two cells (numbered 3 and 7) show clustering/aggregation of GFP as seen by regions of intense fluorescence. Percentage of cells showing clustering is obtained as 2* 100/11 - 27%.<br>
In image 2, no cells are found to have the GFP clustering, out of the 6 cells expressing GFP.<br>

The cell count determined as mentioned in methods section as well as in the previous section, for the wild-type and T286D mutant forms of GFP-a-CaMKII are presented in Figure 5. The T286D mutation which is known to enhance the Ca2+/calmoduin affinity of a-CaMKII also improved its efficiency of binding in the intracellular binding system as seen by the increased (more than two fold) cell count (Figure 5).<br>
[Ca2+]-dependence of cell count -WT and T286D-a-CaMKII<br>
Different concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ are expected to produce proportional increases in intracellular [Ca2+] when ionomycin-mediated Ca2+-influx was generated. This was reflected in the cell count obtained<br><br>
for different extracellular [Ca2+] (Figure 6). As [Ca2+] increased, the cell count also increased. Moreover the T286D mutant of GFP-a-CaMKII which showed enhanced signal compared to GFP-(WT)- a-CaMKII (Figure 5) also showed improved sensitivity to [Ca2+] as seen by response at lower [Ca2+] upto 2 nM. This observation of dependence of the signal on [Ca2+] is the key advancement in our invention making this method suitable for sensing intracellular [Ca2+] in a semiquantitative manner.<br>
Mutants of a-CaMKII and NR2B or NR2A that generate a localization signal in response to intracellular release of Ca2+<br>
The following pairs of mutants of GFP-a-CaMKII and either of NR2A or NR2B sequences when expressed in HEK-293 cells exhibited. Ca2+-dependent binding and generation of localization signals. Some of these pairs generated signals more than the wild-type pair of GFP-a-CaMKII and MLS-NR2B. These could be used either as detection systems with improved sensitivity or under cellular environments where the wild-type pair encounters technical problems such as faulty expression.<br>

Interaction of the binding site on Eag with GFP-CaMKII for detection of intracellular release of Ca2+<br>
The voltage gated potassium channel of Drosophila (Eag) that is localised in synapses as well as in axons also interacts at the T-site of CaMKII (Sun, X. X., Hodge, J. J., Zhou, Y., Nguyen, M., and Griffith, L. C. (2004) J Biol Chem 279, 10206-10214). The Eag amino acid residues 731-803 (or longer or shorter sequences) which comprise the CaMKII binding motif was cloned into the pSGH vector to obtain an MLS-Eag fusion that could be targeted to mitochondria. When wild-type or suitable mutant forms of GFP-CaMKII coexpressed with wild-type or suitable mutant forms of MLS-Eag were activated with increase in intracellular Ca2+, the GFP-CaMKII should translocate to mitochondria giving rise to stable green fluorescent punctae as observed in case of MLS-NR2B. Figure 7 shows the Ca2+-depednent localization of GFP-(WT)-CaMKII to MLS-Eag. This system could also be a Ca2+-sensor similar to the CaMKII-NR2B system.<br>
Any peptide sequence which binds to the T-site of CaMKII similar to NR2B could be used as a binding partner for CaMKII in a Ca2+-sensing system.<br>
NMDA receptor activity<br>
The neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor is a glutamate activated Ca2+-channel that has NR1 and NR2B as subunits.<br><br>
When activated with glutamate and glycine it caused influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium leading to translocation of GFP-D-CaMKII to NR2B that is localized in the nuclear membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. This signal, shown by arrows in Figure 8, was not formed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The signal generation was blocked by the NMDA receptor specific inhibitors, AP-5 and MK-801, further establishing that the signal was specific for the activity of NMDA receptor.<br>
Activity of NMDA receptor containing NR2A subunit<br>
Functional NMDAR can be formed by NR1 and NR2A subunit also instead of the NR1/NR2B combination. However, since the NR2A subunit does not bind CaMKII, a translocation signal consequent to influx of Ca2+ will not be obtained. By additionally transfecting the mitochondrially localized MLS-NR2B sequence, it is possible to detect the activity of the NR2A-containing NMDAR also in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The arrows in Figure 9 show mitochondrially translocated GFP-a-CaMKII.<br>
Detection and measurement of the activity of other Ca2+-channels<br>
Many other proteins with intracellular Ca2+-releasing activity such as Ca2+-channel proteins (nicotinic acetyl choline receptor channel (Grando SA, Horton RM, Mauro TM, Kist DA, Lee TX, Dahl MV., J Invest. Dermatol., 1996, 107, p412-418), tie vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) (Witte DG, Cassar SC, Masters JN, Esbenshade T, and Hancock AA. 2002, J Biomol Screen. 7, p466-475), G-protein coupled receptors (Fujii, R., Hosoya, M., Fukusumi, S., Kawamata, Y., Habata, Y., Hinuma, S., Onda, H., Nishimura, O., and Fujino, M. 2000, J. Biol. Chem., 275, p21068-21074), etc. could be expressed in a heterologous cell culture system to generate specific Ca2+-channel activity. Activity of all such proteins could also be detected if they are co-expressed with a suitable pair of wild-type<br><br>
or mutant forms of GFP-CaMKII and NR2B, NR2A, Eag or any other protein which binds to the T-site of CaMKII, as described in earlier sections.<br>
Vanilloid Rececptor (TRPVl)<br>
Vanilloid receptor is a Ca2+-channel that is activated by capsaicin, one of the active principle of hot chilli peppers (Caterina et al., 1997, Nature, Vol. 389, p816-824). We have found that the activity of vanilloid receptor (TRPVl) could be detected by our invention for Ca2+-sensing. HEK-293 cells cotransfected with TRPVl, GFP-CaMKII and MLS-NR2B upon activation with capsaicin (3 \xM or 10 nM), developed green punctae in a Ca2+-dependent manner as signal for the Ca2+-channel activity of TRPVl receptor. The signal generation we.s specific for transfection by TRPVl, activation by capsaicin and also for the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium. Signal generation due to activation of TRPVl could be inhibited by the TRPVl-specific inhibitor capsazepine (Fig. 10). All these results show that the activity of TRPVl receptor is being detected by our invention.<br>
Neuronal AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluR4<br>
The homomeric AMPA-type glutamate receptor formed of the GluR4 subunit causes Ca2+-influx upon activation by glutamate (Cushing, et al., 1999, J. Neurosci. Methods. Vol. 90, p33-36). Upon transfection of HEK-293 cells with the GluR4 subunit along with GFP-CaMKII and MLS-NR2B, it was possible to detect the Ca2+-channel activity of the receptor. The receptor was activated by treatment with glutamate which caused the formation of green punctae due to translocation of GFP-CaMKII to mitochondrially localized MLS-NR2B. Generation of the signal could be blocked by the specific inhibitor of the receptor, CNQX (Fig. 11).<br><br><br><br>
