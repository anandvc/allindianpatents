				<td>REFRACTORY COMPOSITION FOR CONSTRUCTING STRUCTURE IN<br>
FLUIDIZED BED REDUCTION FURNACE FOR REDUCTION OF IRON<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to refractories for constructing a structure in a<br>
fluidized bed reduction furnace for reduction of iron ore powder by fluidized reaction,<br>
and more particularly, to refractory composition for constructing a structure in a<br>
fluidized bed reduction furnace for use in the FINEX process, which is a new iron<br>
production process.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the modern steel production, an indirect method is used, in which molten<br>
iron prepared at first is subjected to decarbonization, to produce steel. The molten iron<br>
is produced by a blast furnace method, in which coke is used as fuel.<br>
FIG 1 illustrates a diagram for describing a method for producing iron by using<br>
the blast furnace method schematically, wherein iron ore passes through a pretreatment<br>
process in which the iron ore is crushed, concentrated, briquetted of iron ore powder,<br>
sintered, to form hard pellets that are lumps of a predetermined size chargeable into the<br>
blast furnace, when coke from flaming coal is used as fuel. The pellets and the coke are<br>
charged into the blast furnace, and fired to produce the molten iron.<br>
Though the blast furnace method is used as the best iron production method for<br>
mass production of iron presently, the blast furnace method costs high due to<br>
complicated processes, and requirements for additional separate large sized equipment<br>
for sintering and coke production, and causes a problem of discharging sulfur oxides<br>
SOx, nitrides NOx, carbon dioxide CO2, and the like, which are environment pollution<br>
substances, from the sintered steel and coke production.<br><br>
Equipment is developed by POSCO, a Korean steel production company, in<br>
which the production method of the blast furnace method is changed to reduce natural<br>
state iron ore powder directly by fluidized reaction without the pretreatment of the<br>
iron ore and coke, of which patent was filed with Korean patent application No. 10-<br>
1995-41931, patented with a Korean Patent registration No. 10-236160, of which<br>
process is named as FINEX process, and the equipment is constructed and put into test<br>
operation, recently.<br>
FIG 2 illustrates a diagram of the FINEX process, an iron production process,<br>
having the present invention applied thereto schematically, and FIG 3 illustrates a<br>
section of a key portion of the fluidized bed reduction furnace in FIG. 2 in detail. The<br>
FINEX process is a new iron production process for producing the molten iron<br>
economically, in which iron ore powder having a wide range of grain size distribution is<br>
reduced step by step through many stages of the fluidized bed reduction furnaces 1, and<br>
charges into a melting furnace 2 together with 8 ~ 50mm sized briquette coal, to form<br>
molten iron, wherein iron ore powder with a grain size of about 8mm is passed through<br>
many stages of fluidized bed reduction furnaces 1, to change into reduced iron ore,<br>
formed into pellets (HCI; Hot Compact Iron), and charged into the melting furnace.<br>
In view of structure, the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 is provided with a<br>
body 11 having a gas supply opening 11a in a lower portion for supplying a reductive<br>
gas, a plurality of vertical columns 12 in an inside space of the body, and a distribution<br>
plate 13 supported on the columns such that a plurality of portions of the distribution<br>
plate 13 are balanced and supported at the same time.<br>
The column 12 simply supports the distribution plate 13, and the distribution<br>
plate 13 distributes the high temperature, high pressure reductive gas supplied to the<br>
inside space of the body 11 through the gas supply opening 11a, to fluidize and reduce<br>
the iron ore, wherein, because the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 can not, but<br><br>
be exposed to the high temperature, high pressure reductive gas in the inside space of<br>
the body 11, the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 are formed of a refractory<br>
material which has good chemical resistance, good thermal impact resistance, good<br>
mechanical strength, and good abrasion resistance, and the like.<br>
In the meantime, the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 have a plurality<br>
of pass through holes 12a and 13a respectively, for smooth flow and pass of the gas for<br>
fluidizing and reducing the iron ore powder.<br>
Since the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 are structures of a reaction<br>
furnace which is not for small sized experimental equipment, but for full scale<br>
commercial production equipment, the material of the columns 12 and the distribution<br>
plate 13 is required to have no chemical reaction with the reductive gas and various<br>
components of the iron ore in the vicinity of 600 ~ 1000°C which is a main service<br>
temperature of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 during service, good<br>
abrasion resistance in a high temperature, high speed fluidized condition of the iron ore<br>
powder, and good thermal impact resistance enough to endure fast temperature rise and<br>
drop following re-operation of the equipment because cracks occur, not in a continuous<br>
operation, but in an intermittent operation.<br>
Moreover, since the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 are required to be<br>
formed in various shapes of structures depending on design of the equipment, the<br>
material of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 is required to have no fixed<br>
form to enable formation to any shape, and, since most of the equipment is large sized<br>
construction, the material of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 is required to<br>
have no deformation of the structure during curing and drying even after formation, or<br>
explosion during formation.<br>
For formation of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 of the fluidized<br>
bed reduction furnace 1 described thus, after preparing refractory composition for<br><br>
formation of the same, the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 are formed<br>
respectively, wherein, though the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 may be<br>
formed by forming unit blocks of the refractory composition, and building up the<br>
blocks in the inside space of the body 11 in a fashion of general brick laying as shown<br>
in drawings of embodiments, different from this, after construction of molds in the<br>
inside space of the body 11, the refractory composition is mixed with bonding agent,<br>
and the like, the same as mixing general concrete, and filled, and cured in the molds, to<br>
form the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13.<br>
It is apparent that the plurality of pass through holes 12a and 13a are provided<br>
at the time of formation of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 of the prepared<br>
refractory composition for, as described before, smooth flow and pass of the reductive<br>
gas.<br>
Therefore, for formation of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 in the<br>
body 11 of the fluidized bed reduction furnace, the refractory composition is essential,<br>
wherein, since it can be foreseen that a service condition of the columns 12 and the<br>
distribution plate 13 is rigorous, the refractory composition is required to meet the<br>
following product design criteria; density of a structural body being 3.2 or higher,<br>
compression strength under service condition being 1500kg/cm2 or higher, good<br>
thermal impact resistance, abrasion resistance with an ASTM C704 wear rate of 3.0cm3<br>
or below, and the like.<br>
However, taking that the equipment for the FINEX process itself is the first one<br>
in the world into account, there has been no related art refractory composition for<br>
formation of the columns and the distribution plate applied to the FINEX process in a<br>
commercial scale. Though a refractory (comparative example 1) with more than 90%<br>
alumina and around 1000kg/cm2 of compression strength, and without high strength<br>
silica component was applied to an experimental equipment, the refractory causes much<br><br>
shrinkage and many cracks during service due to low thermal impact resistance, even if<br>
the refractory shows good resistance to CO gas.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide refractory composition for<br>
constructing a structure in a fluidized bed reduction furnace for reduction of iron ore<br>
powder, which is different from related art experimental refractory composition, the<br>
structure being columns and a distribution plate, so that the columns and the distribution<br>
plate have good chemical resistance against reductive gas, good abrasion resistance<br>
under high temperature, high speed fluidized bed condition, and good thermal impact<br>
resistance enough to endure rapid temperature rise and drop following re-operation in<br>
an intermittent operation, when iron ore powder having a wide range of grain<br>
distribution is reduced step by step in many stages of fluidized bed reduction furnaces<br>
each having the columns and the distribution plate formed therein.<br>
The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing a refractory<br>
composition for constructing a structure in a fluid bed reduction furnace for reduction<br>
of iron ore powder including 9 ~ 17wt% of calcined alumina, 3 ~ 6 wt% of superfine<br>
evaporated silica SiO2, 5 ~ 10wt% of alumina cement, and balance of sintered or melted<br>
alumina to make up 100wt% of the refractory composition.<br>
Preferably, the refractory composition further includes 0.03 ~ 0.3wt% of<br>
dispersing agent inclusive of setting retarder. The dispersing agent is selected from one<br>
or more than one kind of inorganic salt of hexameta-sodium phosphate, tripoly-sodium<br>
phosphate, tetrapoly-sodium phosphate, acidic hexameta-sodium phosphate, and<br>
sodium carbonate, sodium cirtate, tartarate, poly-acrylate-salts, sodium sulfonic acid,<br>
and naphthalene-sodium sulfonic acid, and the setting retarder is citric acid, gluconic<br>
acid, or boric acid.<br>
Preferably, the refractory composition further includes 0.03 ~ 0.15wt% of one<br><br>
or more than one kind of metal aluminum powder, or organic fiber. The refractory<br>

reaction speed of the aluminum metal powder if the metal aluminum powder is<br>
included. Preferably, the reaction retarder is inhibitor.<br>

grain size, 14 ~ 20wt% of 1mm ~ 75um grain size, and 27 ~ 33wt% of 75um and below<br>
grain size. Preferably, the calcined alumina includes 6 ~ 10wt% of average grain size 3<br>
~ 5um, and 3 ~ 7wt% of 2 ~ 0.5um of average grain size. Preferably, the alumina<br>
cement includes 26 ~ 30wt% of CaO.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
It is preferable that final refractory composition of the present invention has 45<br>
~ 59wt% (weight percent) of 8 ~ 1mm grains, 14 ~ 20wt% of 1mm ~ 75µm grains, and<br><br>
27 ~ 33wt% of 75 µm or below grains, which is obtained as a result of repeated<br>
experiments in view of characteristics of construction and material. If the refractory<br>
composition has more than 59wt% of grains having a size equal to or greater than<br>
8mm, stirring of the refractory composition in mixing with other materials for preparing<br>
material for forming the columns 12 and distribution plate 13 is difficult, and forming<br>
layers of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 closely without pores is difficult<br>
by pouring the refractory composition mixed with other materials into a mold.<br>
The refractory composition is determined to have 45 ~ 59wt% of 8 - 1mm<br>
grains, because, if the refractory composition has below 45wt% of 8 ~ 1mm grains,<br>
spalling resistance becomes weak due to greater shrinkage at 1000°C, the main service<br>
temperature, even though fluidity increases owing to relative increase of fine dust, and<br>
if the refractory composition has above 59wt% of 8 ~ 1mm grains, formed state of the<br>
columns and the distribution plate become poor due to short of the fine dust that makes<br>
formability of the columns and the distribution plate poor.<br>
With regard to the alumina as a main raw material, it is preferable that 95% or<br>
higher purity of lump of sintered alumina, melted white alumina, or melted brown<br>
alumina is used, and especially melted alumina with porosity below 10% for using raw<br>
material with density higher than 3.2 in view of design of the reaction furnace.<br>
Alternatively, the lump may be refractory lump, such as high density zircon, zirconia,<br>
magnesia, which may meet the density requirement, but the characteristic requirements<br>
of thermal impact resistance, chemical resistance, workability, and the like.<br>
Therefore, sintered or melted alumina formed to have density close to<br>
theoretical density is suitable, and preferably, the melted alumina having close texture<br>
with low porosity and low impurity.<br>
The material of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 of the fluidized<br>
bed reduction furnace 1 are required to secure the least fluidity for smooth formation<br><br>
thereof taking provision of many pipes in the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13<br>
for pass of the high temperature reductive gas at a high speed into account.<br>
Compression strength of the formed material is designed to be higher than<br>
1500kg/cm2 after curing and drying, and for meeting the compression strength<br>
requirement, 9 ~ 17wt% of calcined alumina is used, composed of 6 ~ 10wt% of 3 ~<br>
5µm average grain size, 3 ~ 7wt% of 0.5 ~ 2µm average grain size, and 3 ~ 6wt% of<br>
superfine evaporated silica.<br>
Thus, alumina with various grain sizes are used together, for securing required<br>
fluidity, and a close texture, and composition outside of above range can not provide<br>
satisfactory properties.<br>
Of two kinds of superfine evaporated silica with purity of 94% and 97%, it is<br>
preferable to use 97% one because Fe, and Si components present therein as impurities<br>
cause reductive reaction to damage the texture. The evaporated silica is deflocculated to<br>
contain low moisture by assistance of the dispersing agent, to enable the construction.<br>
The superfine evaporated silica starts reaction at a temperature higher than 800°C, and<br>
becomes mullite, to form a more stable texture, enabling to compensate for drop of<br>
strength caused by dewatering of cement at a high temperature, thereby permitting<br>
maintenance of a high strength without drop of strength, actually.<br>
In order to secure the design strength of 1500kg/cm or higher of the structures<br>
(the columns and the distribution plate) of the present invention, 5 ~ 9wt% of alumina<br>
cement with 26 ~ 30% CaO content is used. If below 5wt% of alumina cement is used,<br>
the required strength can not be obtained, and if over 9wt% of alumina cement is used,<br>
the required strength can not be obtained, or even if obtained, spalling resistance<br>
becomes poor due to increased liquid phase material, and decreased amount of mullite<br>
formed.<br>
Workable refractory composition can be prepared only when the dispersing<br><br>
agent is used for having the required fluidity. The dispersing agent may be one selected<br>
from inorganic salt of hexameta-sodium phosphate, tripoly-sodium phosphate,<br>
tetrapoly-sodium phosphate, acidic hexameta-sodium phosphate, and sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium cirtate, tartarate, poly-acrylate-salts, sodium sulfonic acid, and<br>
naphthalene-sodium sulfonic acid.<br>
Other than the dispersing agent, the refractory composition is added with<br>
setting retarder, preferably, such as citric acid, gluconic acid, and boric acid, for<br>
securing retarding of setting.<br>
One or more than one kind of the dispersing agent added with the setting<br>
retarder with a content of total 0.03 ~ 0.3wt% may be used for 100wt% of refractory<br>
powder according to nature of construction.<br>
Moreover, in order to secure dryness after construction, 0.03 ~ 0.15wt% of<br>
metal aluminum powder, or one or more than one kind of organic fiber may be used.<br>
Below 0.03wt% of the same fails to provide a spalling prevention effect in the drying,<br>
and over 0.15wt% of the same makes properties of the structure poor due to excessive<br>
porosity.<br>
In a case metal aluminum powder is used for prevention of occurrence of<br>
spalling during drying, adjustment of a reaction rate of the metal aluminum powder is<br>
required, in which 0.01 ~ 0.05wt% of inhibitor is used as a metal component reaction<br>
retarder. If the reaction retarder is not used, the reaction rate varies with a temperature,<br>
to cause a difference of setting rates between a surface and an inside of the structure<br>
during curing, to fail in obtaining a uniform structure. Below 0.01wt% of inhibitor is<br>
not effective, and over 0.05wt% of the inhibitor makes the strength poor.<br>
Mulling and construction of the refractory composition of the present invention<br>
is made possible by adding water thereto, and steel fiber may be added, as necessary.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described.<br><br><br><br>
Dispersing agent 1* : alumina ADS(Alcoa)<br>
Dispersing agent 1* : Sodium hexameta Phosphate<br>
Dispersing agent 3* : Sodium Pyro Phosphate<br>
In order to form the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 in the fluidized<br>
bed reduction furnace, it is required to secure fluidity of the refractory composition<br>
enough to fill portions of the columns 12 and the distribution plate 13 excluding the<br>
pass through holes 12a, and 13a, for which the fluidity is measured by table flow test,<br>
for evaluation of the fluidity that is required to be minimum 110mm after 15 taps in the<br>
table flow test. As table 1 above shows fluidities of the refractory composition of the<br>
present invention after 15 taps in the table flow test being higher than 110mm, the<br>
fluidity is good.<br>
Table 2<br><br><br><br>
* The spalling occurrence test is carried out for 5 hours at 500°C by a<br>
noncontact flame heating method with a cylindrical test piece with 100mm diameter x<br>
200mm height cured for 24 hours.<br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As has been described, in formation of the columns 12 and the distribution<br>
plate 13 in the fluidized bed reduction furnace 1 of the refractory composition of the<br>
present invention, the present invention can provide a high strength, close textured<br>
refractory structure which enables to secure workability, having bulk specific gravity<br>
higher than 3.2 of a construction metal fibers can be added thereto, compression<br>
strength higher 1500kg/cm2, and 3 or lower ASTM C 708 wear rate, those are basic<br>
design criteria, to permit, in operation of the equipment, the columns 12 and the<br>
distribution plate 13 to have chemical endurance against reductive gas, good wear<br>
resistance under high speed fluidized condition, good thermal impact resistance enough<br>
to endure rapid temperature rise and drop, thereby enabling long time stable operation,<br>
and improvement of iron quality, to make industrial applicability very high.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the<br>

furnace for reduction of iron ore powder in an FINEX process comprising 9 to 17<br>
wt% of calcined alumina, 3 to 6 wt% of superfine evaporated silica SiO2, 5 to 10<br>
wt% of alumina cement, and balance of sintered or melted alumina to make up<br>
100 wt% of the refractory composition, thereby enabling the structure to have<br>
chemical resistance against reductive gas, high thermal impact resistance, high<br>
strength, and high abrasion.</td>
