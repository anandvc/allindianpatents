COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rule 13)<br><br><br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Stable dermatological composition containing allantoin, urea and dimethicone and process for preparation thereof."<br>
2.	APPLICANT:<br>
(a)	NAME: INDOCO REMEDIES LIMITED,<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies<br>
ACT, 1956<br>
(c)	ADDRESS: Indoco House, 166, C. S. T. Road, Santacruz (East), Mumbai -<br>
400 098. Maharashtra, India<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable synergistic dermatological composition comprising the active ingredients Allantoin, Urea and Dimethicone, along with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for the treatment of diabetic foot and dry skin. Further the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the stable synergistic dermatological composition.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
Dry skin is often caused due to a decrease in the moisture content of the skin, especially following anhydrosis. The affected skin usually becomes hyperkeratotic.<br>
Allantoin is a commonly used ingredient in cosmetic preparation, particularly in skin dreams where it exerts a skin protective action. It is a valuable cell proliferating dealing agent which stimulates healthy tissue formation. Allantoin acts as a Keratolytic and an astringent agent. Due to its keratolytic action it removes the dead keratin that causes scaliness of the skin. It thus makes the skin smooth. By precipitating the proteins on the superficial surface of the skin, it protects and strengthens the skin.<br>
Urea is known for its keratolytic properties, ability to soften dry skin and help diminish crusted tissue. Urea is thus added to cosmetic and drug compositions with the object of preventing skin chapping and retaining moisture. But it decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide during the storage, thus increasing the pH of the composition and generating an unacceptable ammonia odor.<br>
Dimethicone (also known as Simethicone) is a water-repellant. By covering the skin it prevents further loss of moisture from the skin. It also acts as a topical barrier that protects the skin.<br>
US patent 6,281,236 describes a skin cream composition containing Allantoin and an emulsifier. The composition has improved stability resulting from adjustment of pH to a range of 4.5 to 5.8.<br><br>
US patent 6,329,413 describes an Allantoin containing skin cream comprising at least one anionic or nonionic emulsifier that is substantially hydrophilic and is soluble in water. The pH of this composition is in the range of 5 to 6.5.<br>
US patent 6,461,624 describes a skin protective composition comprising Dimethicone as a suitable skin protectant.<br>
DE19647100 describes a urea salve comprising urea, propylene glycol, medium length chain triglycerides, glycerin monostearate, Vaseline, cetyl alcohol, panthenol, vitamin E acetate, dimethicone and distilled water.<br>
Various prior arts are available which aim to solve the problem related to urea decomposition as follows:<br>
US patent 6,355,259 describes a skin cream comprising Urea and buffer system comprising disodium hydrogenphosphate and citric acid or a buffer comprising Potassium dihydrogenphosphate, or both, the composition further comprising Allantoin.<br>
Japanese patent application Laid-open No 109487/1977 discloses the addition of Allantoin in an amount of 1% wt or more for the amount of Urea to suppress the odor of ammonia.<br>
Japanese application Laid open No 48441/1976 discloses a method of adding a buffer to urea to adjust the pH to 6-9 and further adding ammonium salt, allantoin, allantoin derivative or Uric acid.<br>
Japanese application Laid open No30509/1986 describes a method of stabilization of adding a basic amino acid to urea.<br>
Japanese application Laid open No 81567/1992 describes a method of stabilization of urea by adding taurine.<br><br>
Japanese patent publication No 56002/1992 describes a method of stabilization of urea by adding neutral amino acid, acidic amino acid or alkaline salt of an acidic amino acid.<br>
Japanese patent publication No 31541/1993 describes a method of adding Lecitin to stabilize Urea.<br>
The Literature mentions various compositions containing Urea and Allantoin, however there is no report on chemical stability of AUantoin in presence of urea. In alkaline pH of 7.0 - 8.0, it is observed that AUantoin degrades drastically in presence of Urea in a cream base.<br>
Nevertheless, there is a need for a stable composition comprising AUantoin, Urea and Dimethicone for the treatment of diabetic foot and dry skin.<br>
The above mentioned active ingredients with synergistic effect offer a comprehensive solution required for tackling the problem of diabetic foot and dry skin.<br>
Thus the active ingredients in combination synergistically act and help in the management of diabetic foot and dry skin.<br>
Objectives:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a stable synergistic dermatological composition comprising active ingredients AUantoin, Urea and Dimethicone, along with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for the treatment of diabetic foot and dry Scaly Skin of various etiologies.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide stable synergistic dermatological composition by using Glacial acetic acid- Sodium acetate buffer system.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a stable humectant, emollient, healing and protective composition for treatment of diabetic foot and dry skin in a cream dosage form.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the stable synergistic dermatological composition.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable synergistic dermatological composition comprising pharmaceutically active ingredients allantoin, urea, dimethicone and a buffer system, along with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The composition is in the cream dosage form.<br>
The buffer system comprises glacial acetic acid- sodium acetate buffer and is used in concentration of 1.5% to 3 % by weight of cream, preferably 2.35 % by weight of cream.<br>
The pH of the stable synergistic dermatological composition is in the range of 5.0 to<br>
7.5. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is water washable cream base selected<br>
from group comprising Cetomagrogo11000, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Hard Paraffin,<br>
Liquid Paraffin Light and the like.	<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are selected from group comprising humectants, emollients, emulsion stabilizers, preservatives, fragrance and other suitable additives.<br>
The humectants are selected from group comprising Glycerin, Propylene glycol, etc.<br>
The humectants are in the range of 5% to 20% by weight of the cream, more<br>
preferably 5-10% by weight.	<br>
The preservatives are selected from Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, and the like. The preservatives are in the range of 0.1% to 0.2% by weight of the cream, more preferably 0.15% by weight of the cream.<br><br>
The composition may be in forms such as a liquid dosage form, a milky white lotion, a gel and the like. A process for the preparation of the stable compositions comprises adding Allontoin and Urea to the aqueous phase containing emollients, humectants and buffer system in purified water; preparing fatty phase consisting of group comprising Cetomagrogol 1000, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Hard Paraffin, Liquid Paraffin Light and preservatives; emulsifying the aqueous phase and fatty phase; adding Dimethicone to the emulsified system and adding other ingredients like fragrance.<br>
