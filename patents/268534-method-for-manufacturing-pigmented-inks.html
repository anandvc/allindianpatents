Description<br>
METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING PIGMENTED INKS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing pigmented inks of consistent quality and producing limited or no waste.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are used in inks for producing monochrome or multi¬coloured images. In the printing business, it is important that the inks are of consistent quality in order to obtain accurate reproduction of the image on paper or polymeric media. Colour images are often produced with a CMYK ink set consisting of a cyan, magenta, a yellow and a black ink each comprising one or more dispersed pigments.<br>
[0003]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after me dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts the re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0004]   Generally the pigment dispersions are manufactured in a batch process an different pigment dispersions often use me same dispersing instalation inbetween :wo catches of pigment dispersions employing different pigments, dispersants and/or dispersion media, the dispersion installation has to be cleaned to avoid hue shifts leading to non-consistent quality of inks.<br>
[0005]    US 6863386 (RICOH) discloses a method for washing the ink<br>
manufacturing apparatus comprising charging the mixing vessel with a washing liquid, circulating the washing liquid through the ink manufacturing apparatus, and then discharging the washing liquid from the ink manufacturing apparatus. The discharged washing liquid is treated as waste.<br><br>
[0006]    EP 753552 A (TOYO INK) and JP 9227810 (TOYO INK) disclose salt milling an organic pigment in the presence of a water-soluble inorganic salt, followed by washing the pigment in water to remove the inorganic salt to give a processed pigment, and dispersing the obtained pigment in an aqueous liquid to obtain an inkjet ink. In this process a determination of concentration is required top obtain consistent inkjet ink.<br>
[0007]    US 2002088375 (SEIKO EPSON) discloses a method for manufacturing a pigment dispersed liquid, comprising at least:<br>
Step A of introducing a hydrophilic dispersibiiity-imparting group directly and/or via another atomic group to the surface of pigment particles; Step B of dispersing the pigment obtained in Step A in an aqueous medium; and<br>
Step C of conducting refining treatment of the dispersed liquid obtained in Step B. Ultrafiltration was used in step C wherein the pigment concentration was adjusted by adding ion exchange water.<br>
[0008]    US 5714993 (XEROX) discloses a method of imaging comprising:<br>
jetting with a liquid jet an ink jettable toner composition comprised of a liquid carrie- vehicle and stabilized core particles comprised of resin, colorant, ana a staDiiizer component wmcn is cova&gt;enny Donded to the core particles, in a predetermined pattern onto a receiving member to form an image: and<br>
fixing the imags to a receiver by heating or irradiating the image and/or the receive- at from aoou: ^0=C to about 150"C. The preparation of stabilized carton oiacK suspensions invention using water the pigment concentration in the stock suspension for preparing ink formulations is reduced by approximately 25%.<br>
[0009]   Along with the discharged washing liquid, certain amounts of pigments are wasted. Correction of the amounts of the components to complete the ink composition is then necessary to obtain consistent quality, ieading to extra measurements and manipulations. Measurement of the colour strength of an ink is cumbersome and very time-consuming and the accuracy of the measurement is also dependent on the colour and strength stability of the standard ink. Even with careful control, these standard inks can vary from<br><br>
batch to batch and tend to flocculate or settle in time, leading to poor test repeatability and difficulty in accurately matching the ink being made to a standard ink.<br>
[0010]  The in-between cleaning of the pigment dispersing apparatus results in<br>
large amounts of washing liquids, representing financial penalties not only by the cost of raw materials wasted, but also by the cost for treating these waste solutions and the loss in production time and efficiency. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a simple and fast method for manufacturing pigmented inks of consistent quality and producing limited or no waste.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
[0011]   It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
manufacturing pigmented inks of consistent quality in a simple and fast way.<br>
[0012]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing pigmented inks producing limited or no waste.<br>
[0013]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0014]   It nas been founo ins: inks of consistent qualify could D8 made from<br>
pigment dispersions and washing liquids composed of at least one liquid component intended to be used in completing the ink formulation, thereby producing minimum waste.<br>

invention comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	preparing a pigment dispersion in a dispersing installation;<br>
b)	charging the dispersing installation with a washing liquid;<br>
c)	discharging the washing liquid from the dispersing installation; and<br>
d)	adding the discharged washing liquid to the pigment dispersion. [0030]   The steps b), c) and d) are preferably repeated at least once.<br>
[0031]   In a preferred embodiment the steps b), c) and d) are repeated two, three or four times, most preferably the steps b), c) and d) are repeated four times.<br>
[0032]   In one embodiment the washing liquid is sent through the dispersion installation and directly discharged.<br>
[0033]   In a preferred embodiment the washing liquid is circulated over the dispersion installation at least once before being discharged.<br>
[0034]   After preparation, the pigment dispersion is usually not yet suitable for a particular application. Oiher ingredients sucn ss surfactants, solvents, photo-initiators, biocides, hardeners, and the like may be required to complete the ink formulation. Before the ink is bottled into cartridges, drums or jerry-cans, a step of filtering the ink is usually conducted.<br>
[0035]in preparing the inkjet ink the preferred that one or more deaassing steps are performed si one ltime or another for removing air or gas ouDbies from the ink. Degassing is preferably performed by heating and/or reduced pressure.  The degassing step(s) can be performed on the concentrated pigment dispersion and/or on the final inkjet ink composition.<br>
Dispersing installations<br>
[0036]   The dispersing installation for preparing the pigment dispersion may<br>
consist of a single dispersing apparatus, but may consist of more than one apparatus. A preferred dispersing installation comprises a mixing apparatus and a dispersing apparatus. Usually pigment, dispersant and<br><br>
dispersion media are combined in a mixing apparatus used for the de-aggregation and the wetting of the pigments.<br>
[0037]   In a preferred embodiment the mixing apparatus is selected from the group consisting of a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer and a dissolve/". The step wherein pigment, dispersant and dispersion media are combined in a mixing apparatus is usually referred to as the pre-dispersing step.<br>
[0038]   In a preferred embodiment the dispersing apparatus is selected from the group consisting of horizontal mills, vertical mills, attritors, vibratory mills, ball mills, planetary ball mills, pearl mills, colloid mills, hammer mills, pin disk mills, double rollers, bead mills, ultrasonic mills, paint conditioners and triple rollers. These mills may contain various grinding media. Suitable grinding media include sand, glass beads, ceramic beads, metal beads, polymeric beads and the like. Non-media mills can also be used, such as high shear dispersers, high-pressure fluid impingement dispersers, such as Microfluidizers from Microfluidics International Corporation, and the like. It is preferred to use a dispersion installation that is controlled by a computer.<br>
[0039]   The dispersing instaiiaiion can consist of tne aforemenncnea apparatus, or a combination of them, working in parallel or in series, simultaneously or consecutively.<br>
the case of using the planetary ball mill, the dispersi<br>
[0040]   A specific method for manufacturing the Inkjet ink comprises tne step of<br>
subjecting pigment todispersion cy s oianetary ball or sand mill using cs^anvc oe-aas of O.C' -"■ C mm -.~ oarocie aiameie:  i" .3prreferrea ton is carried out at an acceleration of 5-50 G and in the case of the sand mill,that in it is carried out at a peripheral speed of 5-20 m/s with a filling rate of the ceramic beads of 50-90%.<br>
[0041]   The time necessary for the dispersing step is influenced by the type of the dispergator, energy efficiency, the stress applied to the dispersion and the like and hence is not particularly limited. The time, however, should be long enough to provide satisfactory dispersion and to cause satisfactory interaction between the pigmentfs) and the dispersant(s). In general, the<br><br>
time is generally determined according to specifications of the device used.<br>
[0042]   For example, when a sand mill (manufactured by Yasukawa Seisakusho) is used, the components are dispersed together with glass beads (diameter: 1.7 mm, amount: 1.5 times (by weight) larger than the mixture) at room temperature for about one hr. When a Mini mill 100 (Eiger Machinery Inc., Bensenbilie III.) is used, the dispersing step is carried out at 3000 to 4000 rpm for about 2 hr.<br>
[0043]   Optimum grinding time and proper pigment to dispersant ratio are needed to reduce the particle size of the pigment to provide suitable pigment dispersions with desired particle size distribution- Grinding or mixing time generally ranges from about 10 minutes to about 24 hours, preferably from about 10 minutes to about 8 hours, and most preferably from about 15 minutes to about 5 hours, depending on the mixing conditions. The pigment dispersion thus obtained may be centrifuged at a speed up to 20,000 rpm and filtered to provide a uniform particle distribution in the ink and to remove unstable larger particles, particularly of pigment. This centrifuge process is optional and the ink may be filtered subsequent to mixing the pigment dispersion with me oiner IHK components  Filtration allows removal of undesired large particles which may clog the channel or nozzle opening.<br>
[0044] In another embodiment the pigment dispersion may be prepared using jlfrasonic energy as sole dispersing tecnmcue or in addition tc another disspersrng lecnnicue. for example5. a pigmen: dispersorr prepared by a pear' mill preceded by an ultrasonic treatment or vice versa.<br>
[0045]   In designing the dispersing installation, dead zones in the tubing and<br>
dispersing equipment should be avoided as the limited flow in these areas reduces the cleaning action by the washing liquids.<br>
[0046]   The pigment dispersion may also be prepared by precipitation. For example, a pigment having at least one carboxylic acid group is first solubilized in the dispersion medium by increasing the pH above 9 and subsequently the solubilized pigment precipitated in the presence of the dispersant by addition of an acid. In another precipitation method, the<br><br>
pigments are solubilized by one or more suitable organic solvents and precipitated in the presence of the dispersant in a dispersion medium wherein the pigment is insoluble.<br>
[0047]   If more than one pigment is present in the pigmented ink, then pigment<br>
dispersions may be made by co-milling the pigments or by dispersing each pigment separately. In the latter case, it is possible to charge the washing liquid to the dispersing installation after milling the last pigment of the ink.<br>
Washing liquids<br>
[0048]  The washing liquid used in the method according to the present invention comprises at least one liquid component of the ink. When the ink contains different liquid components, a mixture of liquid components may be used for the washing liquid. In repeating the cleaning of the dispersing installation, the washing liquid may be the same or different. For example, the first time a washing liquid containing one liquid component may be used, and for the second washing liquid a different liquid component or a mixture of liquid components may be used. Possible washing liquids are listed here below under 'Dispersion Media and Liquid Components of the Ink".<br>
[0049]   The washing liqjid may also contain other solid ink ingredients, CUT in a preferred embodiment the washing liquid consists of a single liquid component. The liquid component depends on the ink type and can for example be water for en aqueous ink. an organic solvent for a solvent cased ink and s monomer 'or radiation curable ink. 'n switching from one type rf ,nn re anotner. s.g  rrc~ an aqueous sfiK :c a rac SDO~ c^raoie ;HK after the iast washing iiquic for the aqueous ink. it is preferred to use a washing liquid comprising a liquid component from the radiation curable ink and discharging it before commencing the dispersion of the pigments of the radiation curable ink.<br>
[0050]   In another embodiment one or more washing liquids, used as liquid<br>
component(s) in the ink , are used to clean the dispersion installation and added to the pigment dispersion, while a final washing liquid may be a different liquid component not present in the ink and wasted instead of adding to the pigment dispersion.<br><br>
[0051] The washing liquid preferably has a viscosity that is suitable for cleaning the dispersing installation using sprayers. Cleaning by mechanical force may be combined with the sprayers.<br>
Pigment dispersions and inks<br>
[0052]  The pigmented dispersion according to the present invention contains at least three components: (i) a pigment, (ii) a dispersant and (iii) a dispersion medium.<br>
[0053]   The pigments are preferably dispersed using a polymeric dispersant.<br>
Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have a polymer chain which sticks out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0054]   The pigment particles in an ink should be sufficiently small, e.g. to permit free flow of an ink-jet ink containing such pigment particles through the ink-jet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength.<br>
[0055]   The average particle size of the pigment in the ink should be between 0.005 urn and 15 Mm. Preferably. me average pigmeni panicle size is between 0.005 and 5 urn. more preferably between 0.005 and 1 urn, and particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 urn. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved.<br>
f0056] The pigment is preferable used in the an amount of the 20 wt% more preferably 0.3 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the ink. Therefore, the pigment dispersion contains the pigment in a higher concentration, typically 10 to 30 wt% based on the total weight of the pigment dispersion.<br>
[0057]  The surface tension of the pigmented ink jet inks is preferably between 30 and 60 mN/m. The viscosity of the pigmented inkjet ink is preferably less than 100 mPa.s at 30 °C. The viscosity of the pigmented inkjet ink is preferably less than 30 mPa.s, more preferably less than 15 mPa.s, and<br><br>
most preferably between 1 and 10 mPa.s all measured at a shear rate of 100 s-1 and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0058]   The pigmented ink manufactured by the method according to the present invention may further contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0059]   The pigmented ink manufactured by the method according to the present invention may further contain at least one biocide.<br>
[0060]   The pigmented ink manufactured by the method according to the present invention may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0061]   The pigmented ink manufactured by the method according to the present invention is preferably an inkjet ink selected from the group consisting of an organic solvent based, an oil based and a curable pigmented inkjet ink. The curable pigmented inkjet ink is preferably radiation curable.<br>
[0062]   The curable pigmented ink may contain monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers possessing different degrees of functionality as liquid components. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-. tri- and/or higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. A catalyst called an initiator for Initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curaDle pigmented dispersion but :S preferably added to the curable pigmented inkjet ink The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer the photo-initiato7 suitable for use in :he curable oigmeni dispersion may oe a Nomsn type information r. a Nomsnt type -,,indicator in a photo-acid generator.<br>
Pigments<br>
[0063]   The pigmented ink manufactured with the method according to the present invention contains at least one pigment, but a combination of a pigment with two or more pigments and/or one or more dyes may be used. The pigment can also be a precipitated dye having at least one carboxylic acid group or a salt thereof.<br>
[0064]   The pigment can be black, white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brown, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br><br>

[0076]   Pigment particles in pigmented inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0077]  The average particle size of the pigment in pigmented inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 urn. Preferably, the average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 urn, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 um, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 urn and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 um. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved.<br>
Dispersants<br>
[0078]   The dispersant used in the pigment dispersion of the method according to the present invention has to meet particularly high requirements. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems  'oss of brilliance and hue shifts. Particularly good disoersion of the pigment panicies is reqairea sn tne case of ,nKs fo~ use ir. x.Kjet primers so as to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter, in addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage o7' me primer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of combination of both, but is p-eferably a polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0079]   The dispersant is used in the pigment dispersion in an amount of 5 to 200 wt%, preferably 10 to 100 wt% based on the weight of the pigment.<br>
[0080]   The polymeric dispersant can be non-ionic, anionic or cationic in nature; salts of the ionic dispersants can also be used.<br>
[0081] The polymeric dispersant preferably has a polymerisation degree DP between 5 and 1000, more preferably between 10 and 500 and most preferably between 10 and 100.<br><br>
.  [0082]  The polymeric dispersant preferably has a number average molecular weight Mn between 500 and 30000. more preferably between 1500 and 10000.<br>
[0083]   The polymeric dispersant preferably has an average molecular weight Mw smaller than 100000, more preferably smaller than 50000 and most preferably smaller than 30000.<br>
[0084]  The polymeric dispersant has preferably a polymeric dispersity PD smaller than 2, more preferably smaller than 1.75 and most preferably smaller than 1.5.<br>
[0085]   Polymeric dispersants are used in ink jet inks in order to deliver a good dispersion of the pigment particles, but more important to ensure high dispersion stability, particularly at higher temperatures, since jetting temperature of inkjet inks can be up to 70°C.<br>
[0086]   Suitable polymeric dispersants include copolymers of two or more (three, four, five or even more) monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Copolymers suitable as dispersants may be obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers 'e.g. monomers A and B poi/menzea into K55AA5A5... monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB): gradient (tapered) polymerizing polymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into AAABAABBAB3B)- polymerizing monomers into block cooolyrners (e.g monomers A s^-i 3 Dol/^enzec1 into AAAAABBBBBB ■ A~eren the block<br>
for the dispersion capability of the polymeric dispersant. Mixed forms of the monomer distributions above can be used, e.g blocky gradient copolymers as well as graft copolymers consisting of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone. [0087]   Suitable polymeric dispersants may have a linear polymer architecture, a comb/branched polymer architecture, a star polymer architecture or a dendritic polymer architecture. Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). Star<br><br>
polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers. Dendrimers have well-defined mono-dtsperse structures wherein all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers are polymers having a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerisation process). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George. Principles of Polymerization. 4th edition. Wiley-interscience, 2004. p.1-19.<br>
[0088]   Suitable polymeric dispersants can be prepared via addition or<br>
condensation type polymerisations. Suitable polymerization methods are described by ODIAN, George. Principles of Polymerization. 4th edition. Wiley-lnterscience, 2004. p.39-306.

[0152]   The pigment concentration in a liquid was determined by<br>
spectrophotometrie measurements with an Agilent HP 8453 spectrophotometer- Where necessary, the samples were first diluted in order to be in a region measurable by the spectrophotometer. Generally the samples were diluted so as to have an absorbance below 2.0, The dilution was in a region where the Beer-Lambert taw can be used and the measured absorbance is then directly proportional to the concentration of the pigment. The absorbance was measured at the point of maximum absorption for the yellow, magenta and cyan pigments and at 500 nm for the black pigment. Prior to the measurement of the samples, a calibration curve for absorbance versus pigment concentration of the dispersions was made between 0 and 0.004% pigment concentration in weight.<br>

[0153]   In manufacturing pigmented inkjet inks, it was experienced that the yellow inkjet ink was usually the most easily visibly contaminated ink. The maximum acceptable level of contamination of a yellow ink by other colour pigments was determined by adding some well known amounts of the other inks to the yellow ink. The contamination level giving a AE94 value of 1 for the fuii densiry yeilovv ink on a Lac plot of a pnniea sarnpie was determined. A AE94 value of 1 was observed for the yellow ink for adding 0.038 wt% of black pigment based upon the total weight of the yellow pigmeni. For the magenta and cyan ink. a iarger amount of magenta oigment.. Q 1 5~ wt% '&gt; c cyan oigrnent : 0.045 wt% i was necessary to observe E 94 value of for me yellow ink<br>
[0154]   In order to manufacture consistent Inkjet inks, the inks should not be contaminated by other pigment(s) in a concentration of more than 0.03 wt% based upon the total weight of pigment(sj in the Inkjet ink.<br>
Preparation of pigment dispersions<br>
[0155]   All pigment dispersions and inkjet inks were prepared in the same way by performing the following steps:<br>
1.   A dispersion premix was prepared by mixing the liquid component(s) and solid components, such as the dispersant and one or more<br><br>
pigments, in a vessel and stirring the dispersion premix for 15 to 60 minutes.<br>
2.	The vessel containing the dispersion premix was then connected to a dispersing apparatus (ECM Poly from Willy A. Bachofen AG Machinenfabrik) through a pump, and the premix was circulated over the dispersing apparatus for a certain time.<br>
3.	At the end of the dispersion process, the dispersion was pumped (via the mill discharge) to a clean vessel where afterwards the other components of the Inkjet ink were added to obtain the final ink composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0156]  This example compares the manufacturing method of radiation curable<br>
Inkjet inks using a standard cleaning operation with the method using a<br>
cleaning operation according to the invention. Comparative radiation curable inkjet ink C-1 [0157]   This comparative inkjet ink illustrates the manufacturing of a radiation<br>
curable magenta inkjet ink followed by a standard cleaning operation. Dispersion step<br>
components according to Tab's '. in a 250 L vessel. The vessel was then connected to a Bachofen ECM Poly mill filled for 65% with 0.4 mm yttrium stabilized zirconia beads. The total tubing length (internal diameter 17 mm) from vessel :o pump from DumD !c mill and from mill back to vessel was<br>
fiowrate of aoour 3 L per minute and a rotation speed in the mrif of aoour 15 m/s. The dispersion was then discharged into a 500 L vessel.<br><br>
Cleaning<br><br>
[0159]   The 250 L vessel was disconnected and replaced by a 60 L clean vessel, in a first step, 40 kg of MEK was put into the 60 L vessel and pumped through tubing and mill to a waste vessel. In a second step, 15 kg of DPGDA™ was put in the vessel and pumped through the mill to the waste vessel. At this stage the mill was believed to be ready for dispersing the next colour pigment.<br>
[0160]   In order to assess how much pigment was still present in the mill and<br>
tubing circuitry, 20 kg of MEK was put in a 60 L vessel and circulated over the mill for about 10 minutes. A sample of the coloured MEK solution was then used to determine the pigment concentration by spectrophotometry. It was found that about 1 gram of C.I. Pigment Violet 19 was still present in the milling circuit.<br>
[0161]   If the following inkjet ink to be prepared would be a yellow inkjet ink, then a 45 kg batch of pigment dispersion at 20 wt% of pigment would have been contaminated by 1g of C.I. Pigment Violet 19 or 0.011 wt% based upon the total weight of the yellow pigment, which is well below the limit of 0.03 wt%.<br>
[0162]   If the standard cleaning operation would have been omitted, a Tuch<br>
higner contamination would nave Deen ooiainea tn preparing the aoove yellow ink. From the 113 kg of dispersion premix charged into the dispersing apparatus only 109 kg of dispersion was collected in the 500 L vessel, meaning mat about &amp; kg of dispersion .was 'ieft" inside the dispersing apparatus at a concentration of 20 wt% of c.i pigment violet curable inkjet ink C-1, about 800 g of pigmeri (and probably more; would have been present in the dispersing apparatus. Using the same 45 kg batch at 20 wt% of yellow pigment for preparing a yellow inkjet ink, a contamination of 3.54 wt% of C.I. Pigment Violet 19 based upon the total weight of the yellow pigment would have been obtained and thus a yellow inkjet ink of unacceptable quality would have been prepared.<br>
Ink preparation<br>
[0163]   The 109 kg of dispersion in the 500 L vessel is expected to have the composition in kg as given in Table 2 . About 436 kg of the final ink<br><br>
composition can be made with the 109 kg of magenta dispersion. The last column of Table 2 gives the amount in kg of components to be added to the dispersion. [0164]<br><br>
[0165]   Even when the amounts of components for completing the inkjet ink were<br>
compensated for the ioss of pigment in tne aisoersion installation fluctuations in pigment concentration have been observed in manufacturing the Inkjet inks. To eliminate these fluctuations, one would have ro perform a time-consuming and expensive verification of the pigment concentration in the pigment dispersion.<br>
[0165]  This [inventive inkjet 1-1 illustrated the manufacturing of the same<br>
magenta inkjet ink as in the comparative radiation curable inkjet ink C-1 but now followed by a cleaning operation in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Dispersion step<br>
[0167] 113 kg of the dispersion premix was prepared in the same way as for the comparative radiation curable inkjet ink C-1 and then discharged from the premix vessel into a 500 L vessel.<br>
Cleaning<br><br>
[0168]   The dispersing installation, including the Bachofen ECM Poly mill and the dirty premix vessel, was cleaned by adding, in a first step, about 21.4 kg of DPGDA™ as washing liquid into the dirty premix vessel by help of a pump and tubing. The jet was oriented along the walls so as to clean them from the remaining dispersion. In a second step, the mixture of DPGDA™ and remaining dispersion was discharged through the tubing, pump and mill to the 500 L vessel containing the previously discharged pigment dispersion. Steps 1 en 2, here above, were repeated three times so that in total 4 x 21.4 or 85.6 kg of DPGDA™ -washing liquid was used to clean the installation. The 85.6 kg of DPGDA™ was available from the ink formulation to clean the dispersing installation. At this stage the mil) was ready for dispersing a next colour pigment (only the premix vessel was taken away for further cleaning).<br>
[0169]   In order to assess how much pigment was still present in the mill and tubing circuitry, the premix vessel was disconnected and replaced by a clean BO L vessel. Then. 20 kg of MEK was added to the 60 L vessel and circulated over the mill for about 10 minutes. A sample of the coloured MEK solution v/as then 'jsed tc determine the pigment concentration by spectrophotometry, it was founa mat 1.03 gram of C.;. Pigment  violet 9 was still present in the milling circuit.<br>
[0170]   If the following Inkjet ink io be prepared would be a yellow inkjet ink. then a ^5 kg batch of pigment dispersion at 20 wt% of pigment would have been contaminated by i 03 g o1"' C.\   Pigment Violet 19 or 0.G1' ■nVz cased uoon The total weight of me yellow pigment  would was below the wt%.<br>
[0171]   The amount of pigment contaminating the dispersion installation also gives an indication of what the minimum batch size of the next colour should be to avoid too high contamination. For the above example with 1.03 g of C.I. Pigment Violet 19 in the dispersion installation, the batch size should at least be 16.5 kg to meet the contamination limit of 0.03 wt%.  However, as explained above, it was observed that yellow ink could withstand more contamination by a magenta ink than by a black ink. For a AE94 value of 1, it was observed that 0.157 wt% of magenta pigment based upon the<br><br>
total weight of the yellow pigment could be added. With this contamination limit of 0.157 wt%, the batch size would only have to be 3.2 kg which is when considering the volume of mili and tubing in fact too small to effectively use the dispersing installation.<br>
Ink preparation<br>
[0172]  The 113 kg of dispersion in the 500 L vessel has the composition in kg as given in Table 3. A total of 452 kg of the final ink can be made with the 113 kg of magenta dispersion, which is 16 kg more than the comparative radiation curable inkjet ink C-1. The last column of Table 3 gives the amount in kg of components to be added to the dispersion, whereof 85.6 kg of the liquid component DPGDA™ was already used as washing liquid to clean the dispersing installation.<br>
[0173]<br><br>
[0174]   Using the cleaning procedure according to the present invention, a very consistent quality of this magenta inkjet ink has been observed. Since almost all of the pigment ends up in the final ink composition no fluctuations in pigment concentration have been observed in manufacturing this magenta inkjet ink. For the comparative radiation curable inkjet ink C-1 it can be seen by comparing with Tabie 1 that approximately 300 g of pigment was wasted. This would cause different<br><br>
pigment concentrations for each batch of ink made, but also includes a financial penalty as the pigment is usually the most expensive component in the ink. With the exception of 1.03 g, all of the 22.6 kg of pigment used to prepare the inventive radiation curable inkjet ink 1-1 ended up in the final ink composition. The excellent consistency of the inks prepared according to the invention eliminated the need to perform a time-consuming and expensive verification of the pigment concentration in the pigment dispersion.<br>
Inventive radiation curable inkjet ink I-2<br>
[0175]  This inventive inkjet ink I-2 illustrates the manufacturing of a radiation curable cyan inkjet ink by preparing the pigment dispersion in the same dispersing installation which was just used to prepare a batch of magenta ink in the same manner as disclosed for inventive radiation curable inkjet ink 1-1.<br>
Dispersion step<br>
[0176}   81 kg of the dispersion premix was prepared by mixing for 30 minutes the components according to Tabie 4 in a 250 L vessel. The vessel was then connected tc a Baclofen ECM Pofy miff fifled for 65% with 0.4mm yttrium stabilized zircona beads. Tne totai lucing length; diameter '7 mrrn from vessel to pump, from pump to mill and from mill back to vessel was about 4 meter. The mixture was circulated over the mill for 6.3 hours at a fiowrate of about 6 L per  minute and a rotation speed in the miii of about 15 rr&gt;,s "The disperson was then discharged into a 500 L vessel<br>
Cleaning <br><br>
[0178]   The dispersing installation, including the Bachofen ECM Poly mill and the dirty premix vessel, was cleaned by adding, in a first step, about 23.5 kg of DPGDA™ as washing liquid into the dirty premix vessel by help of a pump and tubing. The jet was oriented along the walls so as to clean them from the remaining dispersion. In a second step, the mixture of DPGDA™ and remaining dispersion was discharged through the tubing, pump and milt to the 500 L vessel containing the previously discharged pigment dispersion. Steps 1 en 2, here above, were repeated four times so that in total 5 x 23.5 or 117.5 kg of DPGDA™ was used to clean the installation. The 117.5 kg of DPGDA™ was available from the Ink formulation to clean the dispersing installation. At this stage the mill was ready for dispersing a next colour pigment (only the premix vessel was taken away for further cleaning).<br>
[0179]   in order to assess how much pigment was still present in the mill and tubing circuitry, the premix vessel was disconnected and replaced by a clean 60 L vessel. Then, 20 kg of MEK was added to the 60 L vessel and circulated over the mill for about 10 minutes. A sample of the coloured MEK solution was than used to determine the pigment concentration by spectropnoiorratry. It was found mat about 0.55 gram cf Sulfas; Biue 15.3 was still present in the milling circuit,<br>
[0180]   If the following inkjet ink to be prepared would be a yellow Inkjet ink, then a 45 kg batch of pigment oispers'on at 20 wt% of pigment would  have been contaminated by  55 g of Sur-*ast B-je 15:3 or 0.006 with "asec uocn the totai svssgn; o; me  yellow  pigment r. is weit below the wt%.<br>

[0181]   The 81 kg of dispersion in the 500 L vessel has the composition in kg as given in Table 5. A total of 453.6 kg of final ink can be made with the 81 kg of cyan dispersion. The last column of Table 5 gives the amount in kg of components to be added to the dispersion, whereof 117.5 kg of the liquid component DPGDATW was already used as washing liquid to clean the dispersing installation.<br>

[01 82]   In comparing Inkjet printed samples, no contamination could be observed for the inventive radiation curable cyan Inkjet ink I-2 by a magenta ink corresponding lo the inventive radiation curable magenta inkjet ink i-1 previously prepared in the same dispersion installation.<br>

DEGDEE, 17.25 kg of the pigment HostapermTM Red E5B02 and 13.80kg of SOLSPERSE™ 32000 for 30 minutes in a 250 L vessel. The vessel was then connected to a Bachofen ECM Poly mill filled for 65% with 0.4mm yttrium stabilized zirconia beads. The total tubing length (internal diameter 17 mm) from vessel to pump, from pump to mill and from mill back to<br><br>
vessel was about 4 meter. The mixture was circulated over the mill for 12 hours at a flowrate of about 8 L per minute and a rotation speed in the mill of about 15 m/s. After 12 hours another 28.75 kg of DEGDEE was added to the vessel to obtain the composition according to Table 6. The dispersion was mixed for 12 minutes and then discharged into a 500 L vessel.<br><br>
[0187]   At the end of the dispersion process, the mixture was discharged from premix vessel through the mill into a 500 L vessel. From the 115 kg of dispersion premix charged into the dispersing apparatus, 111 kg of dispersion was collected in the 500 L vessel, meaning that about 4 kg of dispersion was "left" inside the dispersing apparatus.<br>
Cleaning<br>
[0186]   The 250 L pre*"iix vessel was disconnected and replaced by a 6G L clean vessel. In a vrsi step. 40 kg of MEK was put into the QC L vessel and pumped through tubing and mill to a waste vessel.
