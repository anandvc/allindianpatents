				<td>The present invention relates to an instrumentation<br>
solid, liquid and gaseous<br>
system for measurement of velocity of/materials in two-phase<br>
f1ows .<br>
The  invention  relates  more   particularly to  an instrumentation system for measuring velocity of materials<br>
flowing simultaneously in tv/o  phases,   such  as  liquid-gas,   gas-<br>
liquid-liquid,<br>
solid,   liquid-solid and/through a pipe line  of  electrical nonconducting  material by  using  two non-intrusive  type  of capacitance  sensing probes disposed  outside the  pipe line  at a specified distance apart,   amplifying the  A.C.  signal output of each sensing  probe,  detecting the in-phase component  of the A.C.   output  signal   of  each  sensing   probe by  a  phase-sensitive detector to  produce  a B.C. voltage outout,   amplifying the D-d. voltage   output  of  each  sensing   probe by  a low drift instrumentation amplifier having  a means  for adjustment of the amplification,   converting  analogue output of each instrumentation amplifier into  corresponding digital signal  by an A/D converter, calculating the velocity of materials  in the statistical  cross-correlation technique by  a Personal  computer   (PC) acquiring the digitised   signal  from each  A/D  converter,   corresponding to  the A.C.  signal  output of  each  sensing  probe.<br>
The measurement  of velocity of materials in two-phase flows is   a challenging  problem.     At  present  no  reliable  means is available  for directly  measuring  the velocity of materials  in two-Phase  flows.     The   industries  requiring   such measurements depend   mostly on  indirect  methods,   such  as   measurement of loss in weight  of materials during  the  flows,   which  are  of low  accuracy.<br>
The object  of   the   present invention   is   to   nrovide  a reliable  means  for direct  measurement of the velocity of materials in two-ohase  flows   as  required   by different  industries,   such  as, steel   plants,   oower olante,   nuclear  plants   and  chemical   olants.<br>
The other object  is   to   provide  a means  for locating the blockage   area in  the  distributed   oioe network  of  pneumatic material   conveying  systems.<br>
The invention   is  described   fully  and   Particularly with reference  to   the  accomoanying drawings   in which  -<br>
Figure   1   shows  the   circuit  diagram of  the  measuring unit  containing  capacitance  sensing   probe   'A),   bandpass amplifier   (B),   Phase sensitive detector   (C)   and  instrumentation amplifier   (D)   used  in the   system;<br>
Figure  2 shows  the  cross  section  of a  oipe  of<br>
electrical non-conducting  material  fitted  with  a non-intrusive type sensing capacitor;   and<br>
Figure  3 shows   an  experimental  set-up for measuring the velocity of gas  bubbles   moving in   a gas-liquid  two-phase<br>
flow through  a  pipe  line.<br>
the measuring  unit containing Referring to  Fig.   1 tj/the capacitance sensing  orobe A<br>
consists  of an electrical  bridge whose armsare  formed by the transformer 5,   active capacitor 3 and  dummy caoacitor A.     The bridge  is  excited by a  sinusoidal voltage   source  1  of amplitude 0.2V   (t&gt;eak  to  peak)  and   frequency  10kHz  connected  across  the orimary of  the transformer,   one terminal  of which is  connected to  ground.     The imba4ancÂ« outout  of the bridge  is  amnlified by an operational  amplifier 2  provided within the sensing  probe.<br>
which  is   of  tyoe  ICL-800? having  a high inout  impedance  and stabilised  by capacitance  feedback  connection.     The  effect  of stray capacitances  on the bridge output  is   comoensated  for by connecting  relatively small  canscitors   across  the  active  and dummy capacitors.     The transformer is   a balanced  torroid   of ratio   1:1:1  wound   on  a  ferrite  core.<br>
The   out out  A-C.   signal   of  the  caoacitance  sensing orobe  A  is   supplied   at   the   in out  of the  band   oass   amplifier 3 which contains   an operational  amolifier 6A of  type OP-07 connected  in  feedback  configuration to   prevent  any phase  shift of the   amplified   signal   output  and   acts   as   a voltage  follower.<br>
The  phase-sensitive detector C  contains  two  MOSFETS (metal   oxide  silicon  field   effect  transistors),   marked   7,   8, which are  connected in  common drain  and   common gate configuration, The  signal   outnut  of  the  band   pass  amolifier  is   supplied   to  the co'.rjnon drain  of the two MOSFETS through  an  operational  amplifier 6B  of type   OP-0?.     The  MOSB'ET 7  if   of N-type   (BS170)  and  MOSPET 8 is  of P-type   (BS250).<br>
A square wave  generator   -) of type  LM-393  is   provided in the  phase-sensitive detector to generate  square wave  output signal  in  response to  the   A.C.  signal  of   10 KHz  frequency supplied   at  its input  from  a  ratio  arm of  the transformer 5  for synchronising  the  ohase-sensitive detector C.     The generated square wave  signal   is   supplied  to  the  common gate of  the  two MOSFETS  7 and 8 through a current limiting   resistor 10 of preferred value   1.2 kilo  ohm to  trigger  the  MOSFETS.     MOSFET  7 conducts during the positive half cycle  and   MOSFET 8 conducts<br>
uring the negative half cycle of the square wave signal.  As a result the wave form of the A-C, signal supplied to the common drains of the MOSFETS oasses through the sources of the MOSFETS in synchronism with the square wave signal to produce a B.C. output voltage at the inout of the low Pass filter 11 which removes the A.CÂ» components of the D.C. output voltage. The D*C. outout voltage of filter 11 is supplied to the input of the instrumentation amplifier D.<br>
The instrumentation amplifier D contains two integrated circuits (1C) 12A, 12B, each being of type AD 624, which are connected in tandem forming respectively the first and second stage of the amolifier.  The oreferred gain of the first stage, 1C (12A), is set at 200 and that of the second stage, 1C (12B), is programmable around 9.  A low pass fitter 13 is orovided in-between the said first and second stages to eliminate the noise signal of 50 Hz frequency oresent in the j.C- inout voltage of the amolifier.  The D.J. voltage obtained at the output of the second stage, 1C (12B), corresponds to capacitance -change of the active capacitor 3 in the corresponding capacitance sensing probe.  The gain controls 14 and 15 are provided in the amplifier for calibrating the system in terms of velocity of the moving materials in two phase flows.<br>
The circuit of the measuring unit shown in Fig. 1 is fabricated on a Printed Circuit Board in a compact form to make it suitable lor easy application in the measurement of velocity of moving materials in two phase flows.  As already stated, two such measuring units are reauired to be fitted OB a<br>
pipe line  at  a specified  distance  apart  along  the direction of the two   ohase  flow of materials.<br>
The D,C.  analogue outout voltages   of the two measuring units  are  converted into  corresponding digital  outputs  by means of two   A/D   (analogue  to digital)  converters  interfacing   a ^86 based  personal  computer   (PC)  operating   at  a  speed  upto   33 MHz through the necessary interfacing  cards.     The A/D converters and  PC  form an integral   oart of the invented instrumentation system.     To detect the  fluid disturbances which are  assumed to retain  their  identity between  the  locations  of the two measuring   points,   a   software    for operation  in   the  statistical cross-corelation  mode  is   adopted.     The   calibration of  the  system in  terms   of   the velocity   of  flow  is  carried   out  by means  of the PC.<br>
In  carrying  out  exoeriments   using  the  invented   system, 12-bit  resolution  and   eight-differential   channel   A/D cards   are used  for interfacing the   PC.     The  conversion  speed  of  the  cards for a  single  channel  is  60 KHz  and  the  inout voltage  required for the  cards  is  _+ 5 volts  or _*  10 volts.     The   response  time of the  system depends  on  the  conversion  time of the  A/D cards and   the   speed   of  the   PC.     The   maximum sampling  speed   achieved through  the software     developed   in  C language  is   30 KHz with two channels,  which is   also  the limiting  soeed  of  the  A/D cards.     The   acquired  data  is   storeo   in  hard  disk  for further processing.     For  PC with  clock  speed  belov;  20  ?4Hz,   the data acquisition  routine is  written  in  C  and   assembly languages  to achieve   a  30 KHz data  sampling  speed.     The data  acquisition<br>
routine has  the facility to select the  sampling soeed  based  on the  expected  maximum velocity  of the  two   phase  flow.<br>
The  signals obtained  from the two measuring units  are Passed   through  an   'average  subtraction1   routine.     The  output signals   of  the  average  subtraction routine  are filtered  to reject  the noise  signal  components thereof.     The standard deviations   of the   'Gaussian window length'   are selected   according to the  sampling speed  and  the total number of samples tested. The means   for automatic   adjustment of the  Gaussian window length depending upon  the   sampling  speed   and  total number of samples   tested  is   provided   in the  software  used.     The  filtered signals   are  cross-correlated  together to  estimate the velocity of the  two   Phase  flow.<br>
If x(t)  and  y(t)  reoresent the two  signals received from the   two  capacitance  sensing   probe?   disposed   'upstream1 and   'downstream1   respectively in the two  Phase flow under measurement,   then  the  cross-correlation  function between  the two  signals   is   :<br>
 (Equation Removed)<br>
 (1) where  Rxy   (to)   is   the  value   of the  cross-correlation  function when  the   upstream signal   is  delayed  by   a time  to,   T is  the sampling duration  of   the  signals   and  t  if   an instant during the sampling   period.<br>
Rxy   attains   its  maximum value when to  is  equal to  the transit time tx  of the material  to flow  from the   'upstream probe'   to  the   'downstream   probe*.     Hence  the  flow rate  is   :<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where  L is the spacing between the two probes.<br>
The velocity of the two phase flow obtained from relation (2) is stored in a file of the computer and also Played on a monitor.  The graphical outputs for different signals can be retrieved as and when required.<br>
Various probe configurations such as strip, ring, parallel plate, double helix are adopted in known capacitance sensors.  With a view to attaining an increased capacitance sensitivity and ease of fabrication, the active and dummy capacitors of each probe have been designed by attaching a pair of curved metal plates on the surface of a pipe of an insulating material like perspex/glass and of round cross section.<br>
From the cross section of the pipe containing the capacitor 3 or capacitor 4, shown in Fig. 2, it is found that<br>
the capacitor comprises a hollow pipe section 16 of insulating<br>
glass material such as perspex^/of internal radius R. and external<br>
radius R,,, a screen 18 of electrical conductor such as stainless steel and two curved metal plates 17A, 173 such as of stainless steel placed in diameterically opposite positions on the outside surface of tube 16 each subtending an angle X at the centre of the tube, being glued thereto and wrapped with an insulating material like paper, and a metal screen 18 such as of stainless steel of external radius R, covering the oipe section containing the capacitor Plates.  The screen is connected to ground.<br>
The preferred design parameters of the capacitor are :<br>
In  a  oarticular  capacitor,   R^   is     10mm      R2  is   11mm R-z is     12mm       and   each  of   plates   17A,   17B   is  of  curved  length 15mm along,   the  outside   circumference  of   nioe   16,  width 10mm along the   axis   of  the   oioe   16  and   thickness   0.04   mm.     The wrapping paoer is   of  thickness   1mm.     The   screen   is   of  stainless  steel sheet  of  thickness  0.04mm.<br>
Any initial  difference   in the   active  and  dummy capacitors   is  removed  by  connecting   additional  caoacitors  of relatively small  capacitance  across  the   active  and  dummy caoacitors   of  a  probe.<br>
In  the   experimental   set-uo shown,  in  Fig.   3 the velocity of  gas-liquid  flow  is   measured  using  the  invented   system.     The set-uo  comprises   a riser tube   18 through which a mixture  of air and  water rises  from its  bottom 19 to  its  top 20.     At  the   bottom of the   riser tube,   comorested   air from  compressor 21   is  supplied through  control valves  22,   23,   and nozzle  25,   and  water  is   fed by gravity from reservoir 26.     The  air-water mixture  formed   at the  outlet   of  the nozzle  being  of  lower density comnared  with water moves   uoward  to the  top 20 of the   riser tube  and   then downward   to   allow the  air to  escape  into  the  atmosphere   and  the water to  return  to  the  reservoir 26.     The   orobe  of one  measuring unit   is disposed  in the   upstream  position  27 and  the   probe  of the  other measuring  unit   is   disposed  in  the  downstream  position 28.<br>
For determining the velocity of a bubble moving upward through the riser tube,   gas   slugs  in the  form of cylindrical bubbles   are  injected  into  the  compressed   air by means   of  a hypodermic syringe 25.<br>
The velocity of  the bubbles   in the riser tube  is estimated   from the   empirical  relation   :<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
where g   is   the   acceleration clue  to  gravity (981cm/sec   );<br>
d   is   the   internal  diameter of  the  riser tube,  which<br>
is   1cm  in  the  set-uo  used;   and V is  the velocity of  the  bubble   in  cm/sec.<br>
The velocity  estimed  from relation   (3)  is   10.96  cm/sec, which comoares  closely with the velocity   9.^3  to  9*63  cm/sec, determined  by using  the  invented   system for bubbles   of different  sizes.<br><br><br><br><br>
