It is a further object of this invention to provide a self-supporting film which is biodegradable.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus  according to this invention is provided a process  for  the/<br>
t<br>
preparation of low-absorbing self-support ing films comprising' the<br>
steps of s<br>
mixing a blend of starch, piasticizers and solvent to make a uniform suspension;<br>
pouring  the suspension on a smooth plate, followed by  spreading the suspension to form a film; drying said film; and<br>
peel ing off the same to obtain the low-absorb ing self-supporting films.<br>
According to this invention is further provided low-absorb ing i=e If-supporting film made from a blend of starch, pi ast ic: i sers &amp;nd solvent.<br>
According to this invention is provided self-supporting films prepared by casting technique using blends of biopolymers and other functional agents, all edible materials which exhibit very-si ight-~to~no-absorption of oils <fats> while possessing a reasonably  good  transparency.  The? f i lms can also be  appl ied  as  a<br>

wrapper or as a packaging aid for fats, oils, fatty foods,  fried food  products or greasy materials, confectionery items,  snacks,<br>
cookies, etc. to<br>

prevent migration of fat/oll or alike. The flims can be applied as partial substitute of some synthetic packaging materials, like poty-thene/polypropylene or alike when their appficattons are confined to low moisture foods or low relative humidity storage conditions. Unlike synthetic packaging materials and btopolymer- synthetic polymer blended films, these films are completely biodegradable or when discarded, could also be used as fodders. Al the Ingredients used are generally recognised as safe (GRAS).<br>
The fims are prepared using starches from cereal origin, preferably corn, wheat, rice, etc. as a major fngredfenf in the blends. Solvents) (water and/or ethanol In appropriate proportions), plasttelsers (ateoho"c and poryhydroxy compounds), other biopotymers (optional) such as proteins (from cereals or animals), cellulose and various cellulose derivations, etc. are also present in the blend.<br>
The process for the preparation of the ffens comprises mixing ingredients such as 4 to 15% w/w of starch; 0.2 to 10% w/w of ptostteteers; 0 to 5% w/w of blopolymers other than starch, singles or mixture and opt to rally upto 10% of cross-Unking agents, thoroughly at 80-100 °C to make a untform suspension, continuing to mix tor a further period of 10-20 minutes until the mass appeared to be transparent or translucent, pouring the mass on specialty cleaned plates, spreading the same to maintain uniform thickness, drying the mass at a temperature of 40-50 °C, peeling off the film storing/ageing the film under ambient conditions for a period of 3-6 months.<br>
For the step of pouring on plates, smooth plates such as coated glass, polymeric sheet or the lice are used. The mass Is spread on the plates in a uniform layer of thickness around 1-3mm. The spread mass on the plate to dried under low circulation of all and controlled temperature around 40-50 °C. Rapid drying is . detrimental to the ultimate quality of the firnis.<br>
