= 4 =<br><br>
9)  Final Finishing by flange end Trimming etc.<br>
The process involves the production of metal reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes. The pipes are manufactured by producing an inner sleeve of Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipe over a mandrel, which is then inserted into a metal shell thus forming the inner sleeve of the pipe. The outer layer of the pipe is then produced by forming a Polyethylene / Polypropylene outer layer over the reinforced metal shell and the over lapping end segment of the inner sleeve electrofusion welded together with the outer sleeve so that the reinforced metal shell is completely embedded into the Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner and outer sleeves.<br>
PROCESS IN DETAIL :<br>
I. PRODUCTION OF REINFORCED INNER METAL SHELL SECTION<br>
Depending on the type of jointing required, metallic end profiles are prefabricated and then they are welded on to either end of the metal shell.<br>
The end profiles can be any of the four type:<br>
a)	Flanges for flange joints<br>
b)	Spigot end &amp; socket end for spigot - socket ends<br>
c)	Extended thicker metal shell  section  on either  ends for direct welded joints.<br>
d)	Male &amp; Female sections for male - female joints.<br>
Metal shell fitted with suitable end profiles is then attached to<br>
= 5 =<br><br>
the tension winding machine for pre-stressing by wire winding or bar steel wrapping as desired.<br>
II.	PRODUCTION OF INNER LAYER :<br>
The inner sleeve metal shell reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are produced over a suitable mandrel of required diameter.<br>
The mandrel is loaded on to the mandrel drive and the mandrel drive and extruder are synchronized to produce the extruded inner layer.<br>
The molten Polyethylene / Polypropylene material which comes out of the extruder in the form of flat strips of preset dimensions wrapped around the mandrel to form the inner sleeve , and the desired thickness is controlled by an overhead roller. Once the layer formation process is completed , the mandrel along with the Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is rapidly cooled. The cooled Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is then removed from the mandrel .<br>
III.	INSERTION  OF INNER  POLYETHYLENE / POLYPROPYLENE SLEEVE INTO<br>
THE  REINFORCED  METAL SHELL.<br>
The Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner sleeve is prepared for insertion into the pre - tensioned metal shell after proper trimming and signing of the edges.<br>
Metal shell is horizontally anchored into position and the inner Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is pushed into the metal shell to obtain a tight fit sleeve into position.<br>
= 6 =<br><br>
The inner layer is plasticized to form a tight sleeve with out voids or air bubbles. A bonding agent is applied over the Polyethylene / Polypropylene layer before insertion.<br>
If the inner layer is produced by direct layering of inner layer inside the metal shell or by wrapping and welding  Polyethylene / Polypropylene  sheets inside metal shell section then this stage is omitted.<br>
IV.	PRODUCTION OF OUTSIDE LAYER ON TO THE METAL SHELL<br>
The metal shell , with the inner sleeve is attached to the mandrel drive for the outside Polyethylene / Polypropylene layering process. The shell is applied with bonding agents.<br>
The outer layering starts from the extended inner sleeve and proceeds further to overlap the reinforced metal shell and then ends up by other end of the extruded inner layer , resulting in the complete encapsulation of the reinforced metal shell.<br>
The completed outer sleeve is then cooled to normal temperature and the finished pipe is taken out of the mandrel for final trimming and finishing. The bonding agent helps to bond the Polyethylene / Polypropylene and MS.<br>
V.	FINAL  FINISHING &amp;  END CONNECTION  TRIMMING<br>
Both the ends of the pipe is trimmed to suit the various type of end connection as desired. There are possible changes of structure of reinforcement by the following embodiments given in ANNEX 1 and the details of their construction are discussed here below .-<br><br>
comparison with the new invention:-<br>
COMPARISON OF NEW  INVENTION WITH CONVENTIONAL  ONE<br><br>
CONVENTIONAL<br>
1. Concrete pipes, RCC pipes, PSC pipes , Brick Lined section pipes which are generally used on sewage rehabilitation are brittle in nature and have less life spans owing to the corrosion by sewer gas attacks.<br><br>
NEW  INVENTION<br>
MS reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes &amp; sections are by natureless brittle and have longer life span owing to higher resistance to corrosion<br><br><br><br>
2. The " C " value which determines the flow rate in the pipes mentioned above decreases over the years, because of increase in resistance due to abrasion and formation of deposits on the walls of the pipes.<br><br>
MS reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are highly abrasion resistant &amp; also the smooth Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipe surface is less prone to the formation of deposits &amp; hence the "C" value remains virtually the same as that of the new pipe over the years.<br><br><br><br>
3. All the above mentioned pipes are prone to the development of cracks and then cracks propagation which  lead  to premature<br><br>
MS reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are resis--tant to crack their formation and therefore sudden pipe collapses  and  failures  are<br><br>
pipe failure &amp; collapses.<br><br>
virtually absent.<br><br><br><br>
4. All the above pipes are susceptible to the damages during land shift &amp; earth quakes etc.<br><br>
MS reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene are resistant to land shift &amp; earthquakes owing to its flexibility.<br><br><br><br>
5. External corrosion occurs in all the above pipe which decreases the over all life span of the pipes .<br><br>
The  external  layer  of Poly¬ethylene/Polypropylene coating prevents any external corrosion and there by the life span of the pipes are also increased.<br><br>
2] BENEFITS OF INVENTION OVER CONVENTIONAL ONE :<br>
Conventionally , sewage lines are laid using concrete, RCC pipes, PSC pipes. Brick lined sections which have less life span, because they are less corrosion resistant and more prone to structural failures owing to the brittle nature.<br>
To rehabilitate the above conventional sewage system, MS reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes which will have longer life span as they are more corrosion resistant and with less structural failures as Mild Steel &amp; Polyethylene / Polypropylene  are less brittle.<br>
For sewer and water pipe line applications , thicker HDPE pipes are required for higher ring stiffness and higher pressure ratings, {without reinforcement) which are more costly , &amp; hence generally not used.<br>
= 9 =<br><br>
However , with the new process , by using thin walled Polyethylene / Polypropylene layers over mild steel reinforcement , the over all quantity of Polyethylene / Polypropylene required is reduced , and hence the over all cost is brought down lower than the other, pipes.<br>
By  virtue  of  the  combined  qualities  of  Polyethylene  / Polypropylene  as well as mild steel reinforcement and the reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are more suitable for earthquake prone region.<br>
3] OPERATIONAL PARTICULARS / DESCRIPTION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS:<br>
MILD STEEL REINFORCED POLYETHYLENE / POLYPROPYLENE PIPES ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE  FOLLOWING PROCESS:-<br>
The required Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner layer of appropriate thickness is formed around a mandrel, by an extrusion machine which produces the Polyethylene / Polypropylene molten material or the inner layer is directly extruded inside the MS pipe. The Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner layer is coated with bonding agent.<br>
The middle Mild Steel reinforcement pipe is then inserted over the inner layer of Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipe. The MS pipe is then applied with bonding agent.<br>
The outer layer of Polyethylene / Polypropylene is then formed over the mild steel reinforcement pipe, making sure that the either end of the Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner and outer layers are electrofusion welded together so that the mild steel ring is not exposed at either side.<br>
= 10 =<br><br>
The reinforced pipe is then removed from the mandrel after allowing the Polyethylene / Polypropylene outer layer to cool down and harden.<br>
Whenever necessary , the required profiles are introduced at either ends of the pipes so as to form the required locking &amp; sealing arrangements , when two sections of reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are joined together .<br>
4] DESCRIPTION &amp; CLAIMS PERTAINING TO NOVELNESS OF INVENTION WHICH NEEDS PROTECTION :-<br>
Mild Steel Reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene Pipes are Corrosion Proof {internal &amp; external) &amp; have higher Ring Stiffness &amp; pressure ratings.<br>
The sections of pipes are made as push fit which makes the joining process easier &amp; no site welding or other operations are required in the normal conditions.<br>
Inside lining has not been done anywhere before and hence the product and the process needs protection.<br>
Double layering process has never been done before , &amp; hence the product &amp; the process needs protection.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention , several modifications are possible which may be considered within the spirit and ambit of this invention.<br>

mandrel.<br>
= 4 =<br><br>
9)  Final Finishing by flange end Trimming etc.<br>
The process involves the production of metal reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes. The pipes are manufactured by producing an inner sleeve of Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipe over a mandrel, which is then inserted into a metal shell thus forming the inner sleeve of the pipe. The outer layer of the pipe is then produced by forming a Polyethylene / Polypropylene outer layer over the reinforced metal shell and the over lapping end segment of the inner sleeve electrofusion welded together with the outer sleeve so that the reinforced metal shell is completely embedded into the Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner and outer sleeves.<br>
PROCESS IN DETAIL :<br>
I. PRODUCTION OF REINFORCED INNER METAL SHELL SECTION<br>
Depending on the type of jointing required, metallic end profiles are prefabricated and then they are welded on to either end of the metal shell.<br>
The end profiles can be any of the four type:<br>
a)	Flanges for flange joints<br>
b)	Spigot end &amp; socket end for spigot - socket ends<br>
c)	Extended thicker metal shell  section  on either  ends for direct welded joints.<br>
d)	Male &amp; Female sections for male - female joints.<br>
Metal shell fitted with suitable end profiles is then attached to<br>
= 5 =<br><br>
the tension winding machine for pre-stressing by wire winding or bar steel wrapping as desired.<br>
II.	PRODUCTION OF INNER LAYER :<br>
The inner sleeve metal shell reinforced Polyethylene / Polypropylene pipes are produced over a suitable mandrel of required diameter.<br>
The mandrel is loaded on to the mandrel drive and the mandrel drive and extruder are synchronized to produce the extruded inner layer.<br>
The molten Polyethylene / Polypropylene material which comes out of the extruder in the form of flat strips of preset dimensions wrapped around the mandrel to form the inner sleeve , and the desired thickness is controlled by an overhead roller. Once the layer formation process is completed , the mandrel along with the Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is rapidly cooled. The cooled Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is then removed from the mandrel .<br>
III.	INSERTION  OF INNER  POLYETHYLENE / POLYPROPYLENE SLEEVE INTO<br>
THE  REINFORCED  METAL SHELL.<br>
The Polyethylene / Polypropylene inner sleeve is prepared for insertion into the pre - tensioned metal shell after proper trimming and signing of the edges.<br>
Metal shell is horizontally anchored into position and the inner Polyethylene / Polypropylene sleeve is pushed into the metal shell to obtain a tight fit sleeve into position.<br>
= 6 =<br><br>
The inner layer is plasticized to form a tight sleeve with out voids or air bubbles. A bonding agent is applied over the Polyethylene / Polypropylene layer before insertion.<br>
If the inner layer is produced by direct layering of inner layer inside the metal shell or by wrapping and welding  Polyethylene / Polypropylene  sheets inside metal shell section then this stage is omitted.<br>
IV.	PRODUCTION OF OUTSIDE LAYER ON TO THE METAL SHELL<br>
The metal shell , with the inner sleeve is attached to the mandrel drive for the outside Polyethylene / Polypropylene layering process. The shell is applied with bonding agents.<br>
The outer layering starts from the extended inner sleeve and proceeds further to overlap the reinforced metal shell and then ends up by other end of the extruded inner layer , resulting in the complete encapsulation of the reinforced metal shell.<br>
The completed outer sleeve is then cooled to normal temperature and the finished pipe is taken out of the mandrel for final trimming and finishing. The bonding agent helps to bond the Polyethylene / Polypropylene and MS.<br>
V.	FINAL  FINISHING &amp;  END CONNECTION  TRIMMING<br>
Both the ends of the pipe is trimmed to suit the various type of end connection as desired. There are possible changes of structure of reinforcement by the following embodiments given in ANNEX 1 and the details of their construction are discussed here below .-<br><br>
