Fibre-reactive dves. their preparation and their use<br>
The present invention relates to fibre-reactive dyes, to a process for their preparation and to their use in the dyeing or printing of textile fibre materials.<br>
The practice of dyeing using reactive dyes has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the economic efficiency of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to be a need for novel reactive dyes having improved properties, especially in respect of their application.<br>
Dyeing nowadays requires reactive dyes that have sufficient substantivity and at the same time have good ease of washing off of unfixed dye. They should also have a good colour yield and high reactivity, the objective being to provide especially dyeings having high degrees of fixing. The known dyes do not satisfy these requirements in all properties.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is accordingly to find, for the dyeing and printing of fibre materials, novel improved reactive dyes having the qualities characterised above to a high degree. The novel dyes should especially be distinguished by high fixing yields and high fibre-dye bond stabilities, and in addition it should be possible for dye not fixed to the fibre to be washed off readily. The dyes should also yield dyeings having good allround fastness properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting.<br>
It has been found that the problem posed is largely solved by the novel dyes defined herein-<br>
below.<br>

The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of dyes of formula (1)<br>
which comprises<br>
(i) diazotisation of approximately one molar equivalent of an amine of formula<br>
D2-NH2 (13)<br>
in customary manner and reaction with approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula<br><br>
to form a compound of formula<br><br>
and<br>
(ii) diazotisation of approximately one molar equivalent of an amine of formula<br>
D1-NH2 (16)<br><br>
in customary manner and reaction with approximately one molar equivalent of the compound of formula (15a) obtained according to (i) to form a compound of formula (1) wherein D1, D2, Q1 and Q2 each have the definitions and preferred meanings given hereinabove.<br>
The diazotisation of the amines of formulae (13) and (16) is carried out in a manner known perse, for example using a nitrite, for example an alkali metal nitrite such as sodium nitrite, in a mineral acid medium, for example in a hydrochloric acid medium, at temperatures of, for example, from -5 to 40°C and preferably at from 0 to 20°C.<br>
The coupling to the coupling components of formulae (14) and (15a) is carried out in a manner known per se at acidic or neutral to slightly alkaline pH values, for example a pH value of from 0 to 8, and at temperatures of, for example, from -5 to 40°C, preferably from 0 to 30°C.<br>
The first coupling - (i) - takes place in an acidic medium, for example at a pH of from 0 to 4, and the second coupling - (ii) - at elevated pH values, in a slightly acidic, neutral or slightly alkaline medium, for example a pH value of from 4 to 8.<br>
By proceeding as described hereinabove but, instead of using approximately one molar equivalent each of the amines of formulae (13) and (16) in process steps (i) and (ii), using in each case approximately one molar equivalent of a mixture of at least two, preferably two, non-identical amines, for example a 1:1 molar mixture of the compounds of formulae (13) and (16), there is obtained first of all, according to (i), a mixture of compounds of formulae<br><br><br>
and, on further reaction of the mixture of compounds of formulae (15a) and (15b) according to(ii), a mixture of dyes of formulae (1a), (1b), (1c) and (1d)<br><br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to dye mixtures that comprise at least one dye of formulae (1a) and (1b) together with at least one dye of formulae (1c) and (1d), especially one dye each of formulae (1a), (1b), (1c) and (1d), wherein D1, D2, Q1 and Q2 each have the definitions and preferred meanings given hereinabove and D1 and D2 are not identical.<br>
The ratio of the dyes of formulae (1a), (1b), (1c) and (1d) in the mixture can vary within wide limits and depends on the ratio of the particular amines DrNH2 and D2-NH2 used according to (i) and (ii).<br><br>
The above dye mixtures contain, for example, from 5 to 95 % by weight, especially from 10 to 90 % by weight and preferably from 20 to 80 % by weight, of a dye of formula (1a) and/or (1b), based on the total amount of the dyes of formulae (1a), (1b)f (1c) and (1d) in the mixture.<br>
Where appropriate, the end product may, in addition, be subjected to a conversion reaction. Such a conversion reaction is, for example, the conversion of the radical Y denoting -CH2CH2-U or another reactive group capable of conversion to a vinyl moiety into the corresponding vinyl form by treatment with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, such as, for example, the conversion of the β-sulfatoethylsulfonyl or (3-chloroethylsuifonyl group into the vinylsulfonyl radical. Such reactions are known perse.<br>
The compounds of formulae (13), (14) and (16) are known or can be obtained in a manner known per se.<br>
For example, the compound of formula (16) wherein D1 is a radical of the above formula (5) can be prepared by condensation of approximately one molar equivalent of 2,4,6-trichloro-s-triazine or 2,4,6-trifIuoro-s-triazine first with approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula<br><br>
at a pH value in the neutral range and at low temperature, for example from 0 to 5°C, and then with approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula<br><br>
at a slightly acidic to neutral pH value, for example pH 4.5-7.5, and at a temperature of, for example, from 0 to 30°C.<br><br>
Such condensation reactions are known and are described, for example, in EΒ-A-0 260 227 and US-A-4 841 049.<br>
instead of the compound of formula (17), a preliminary product, for example a diazo component or coupling component, may alternatively be used in the process, the radical T3 being produced only in the further course of the process by a corresponding diazotisation and coupling reaction.<br>

The present invention accordingly relates also to the use of the reactive dyes according to the invention in the dyeing or printing of hydroxyl-grouβ-containing or nitrogen-containing, especially cotton-containing, fibre materials.<br>
The reactive dyes according to the invention can be applied to the fibre material and fixed to the fibre in a variety of ways, especially in the form of aqueous dye solutions and dye print pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for dyeing in accordance with the pad-dyeing method; they can be used at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in the pad-steam process. The degrees of fixing are high and unfixed dye can be washed off easily, the difference between the degree of exhaust and the degree of fixing being remarkably small, that is to say the soaping loss being very low. The reactive<br><br>
dyes according to the invention are also suitable for printing, especially on cotton, but are equally suitable also for printing nitrogen-containing fibres, for example wool or silk or blend fabrics that contain wool.<br>
The dyeings and prints produced using the reactive dyes according to the invention have a high tinctorial strength and a high fibre-to-dye binding stability in both the acidic and the alkaline range, and furthermore have good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, to water, to sea water, to cross-dyeing and to perspiration. The dyeings obtained exhibit fibre levelness and surface levelness.<br>
The present invention relates furthermore to aqueous inks that comprise a reactive dye of formula (1) wherein Q1( Q2, Di and D2 each have the definitions and preferred meanings given hereinabove.<br>

Synthetic thickeners that may be mentioned are, for example, those based on poly(meth)acrylic acids or poly(meth)acrylamides.<br>
The inks comprise such thickeners, for example, in an amount of from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks may also comprise buffer substances, e.g. borax, borates, phosphates, poly-phosphates or citrates. Examples that may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate and sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5.<br>
As further additives, the inks may comprise surfactants or humectants.<br><br>
Suitable surfactants include commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants. As humectants in the inks according to the invention there come into consideration, for example, urea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 % to 60 % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight.<br>
Preference is given to inks having a viscosity of from 1 to 40 mPa-s, especially from 1 to 20 mPa*s and more especially from 1 to 10 mPa-s.<br>
Furthermore, the inks may in addition comprise customary additives, e.g. anti-foams or especially substances that inhibit fungal and/or bacterial growth. Such additives are usually used in amounts of from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks can be prepared in customary manner by mixing together the individual constituents in the desired amount of water.<br>
The inks according to the invention are suitable especially for use in recording systems of a kind in which an ink is forced out of a small aperture in the form of droplets that are directed onto a substrate on which an image is formed. Suitable substrates are, for example, paper, textile fibre materials or plastics films. Suitable recording systems are, for example commercially available ink-jet printers for use in paper or textile printing, or writing instruments, such as fountain pens or ballpoint pens, and especially inkjet printers.<br>
Depending on the use, it may be necessary, for example, for the viscosity or other physical properties of the ink, especially properties that have an influence on the affinity for the substrate in question, to be adapted accordingly.<br>
As examples of paper that can be printed with the inks according to the invention there may be mentioned commercially available ink-jet paper, photo paper, glossy paper, plastics-coated paper, e.g. Epson Ink-jet Paper, Epson Photo Paper, Epson Glossy Paper, Epson Glossy Film, HP Special Ink-jet Paper, Encad Photo Gloss Paper and llford Photo Paper.

In the case of the ink-jet printing method, individual droplets of ink are sprayed onto a substrate from a nozzle in a controlled manner. It is mainly the continuous ink-jet method and the droβ-on-demand method that are used for that purpose. In the case of the continuous ink-jet method, the droplets are produced continuously, droplets not required for the printing operation being discharged into a receptacle and recycled. In the case of the droβ-on-demand method, on the other hand, droplets are generated as desired and used for printing; that is to say, droplets are generated only when required for the printing operation. The production of the droplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo ink-jet head or by thermal energy (bubble jet). For the process according to the invention, printing by means of a piezo ink-jet head is preferred, but preference is given also to printing according to the continuous ink-jet method.<br>
The recordings, for example prints, produced are distinguished especially by a high tinctorial strength and a high colour brilliancy as well as by good light-fastness and wet-fastness properties.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, parts are parts by weight and percentages relate to % by weight. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume in a ratio of kilograms to litres.<br>

After the dropwise addition, the pH value is adjusted to 6 (second coupling). When coupling is complete, the dye solution is freed of salt by dialysis and concentrated by evaporation in vacuo. A compound is obtained which in the form of the free acid corresponds to formula<br><br>
(Ymax.' 550 nm), which dyes wool and cellulose in a bluish violet shade having good allround fastness properties.<br>
Examples 22 to 39v: A compound of the general formula<br><br><br>
can be prepared analogously to the procedure described in Example 21 by using, instead of the amine of formula (101), an equimolar amount of one of the amines of formula Dxy-NH2 indicated in Table 2. The dyes dye wool and celluose in orange to blue shades having good allround fastness properties.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 40 to 57: By proceeding as described in Example 21 but, instead of using the acid suspension of the diazo compound of the amine of formula D10-NH2, using an equimolar amount of the diazo compound of an amine of formula Dxy-NH2, a dye of formula<br><br>
is obtained wherein Dxy corresponds to one of the radicals listed in Table 3( the definitions given in Table 1 applying to that radical. The dyes dye wool and cellulose in bluish violet shades having good allround fastness properties.<br>
Table 3:<br><br><br>
Examples 58 to 62: The compounds of the following formulae can be prepared analogously to the procedure described in Example 21<br><br><br><br>
which dye wool and cellulose in violet to dark-blue shades having good allround fastness properties.<br>
Dyeing procedure I<br>
100 parts of cotton fabric are introduced at 60°C into 1500 parts of a dye bath containing 45 g/l of sodium chloride and 2 parts of the reactive dye obtained according to Example 21. After 45 minutes at 60°C, 20 g/l of calcined soda are added. Dyeing is continued for a further 45 minutes at that temperature. The dyed goods are then rinsed, soaped at the boil for a quarter of an hour with a non-ionic detergent, rinsed again and dried.<br>
As an alternative to the above procedure, the dyeing can be carried out at 80°C instead of at 60°C.<br>
Dyeing procedure II<br>
0.1 part of the dye according to Example 21 is dissolved in 200 parts of water, and 0.5 part of<br>
sodium sulfate, 0.1 part of a levelling agent (based on the condensation product of a higher<br><br>
aliphatic amine and ethylene oxide) and also 0.5 part of sodium acetate are added. The pH is then adjusted to a value of 5.5 using acetic acid (80 %). The dye bath is heated at 50°C for 10 minutes and then 10 parts of a woollen fabric are added. Heating is then carried out in the course of approximately 50 minutes to a temperature of 100°C and dyeing is carried out at that temperature for 60 minutes, after which the dye bath is allowed to cool and the dyed goods are removed. The woollen fabric is washed with hot and cold water, and is then spun and dried.<br>
Printing procedure I<br>
3 parts of the dye obtained according to Example 21 are sprinkled, with rapid stirring, into<br>
100 parts of a stock thickener containing 50 parts of 5 % sodium alginate thickener,<br>
27.8 parts of water, 20 parts of urea, 1 part of sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate and 1.2 parts<br>
of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The print paste so obtained is used to print a cotton fabric,<br>
and the resulting printed material is dried and steamed in saturated steam for 2 minutes at<br>
102°C. The printed fabric is then rinsed, if desired soaped at the boil and rinsed again, and<br>
subsequently dried.<br>
Printing procedure II<br>
(a)	Mercerised cotton satin is pad-dyed with a liquor containing 30 g/l of sodium carbonate and 50 g/l of urea (70 % liquor pick-up) and dried.<br>
(b)	Using a droβ-on-demand inkjet head (bubble jet), the cotton satin pretreated according to Step (a) is printed with an aqueous ink containing<br>
-10 % by weight of the reactive dye according to Example 21,<br>
-	20 % by weight of 1,2-propylene glycol and<br>
-	70 % by weight of water.<br>
