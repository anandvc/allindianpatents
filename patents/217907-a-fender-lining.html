				<td>1.       Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fender lining disposed between a fender panel and a bumper and a vehicle body side member, with a lining plate surface being formed on a front side and more particularly, to a fender lining that improves the surface of a lining plate to be disposed on a front side of the vehicle.<br>
2.	Description of  the Related Art<br>
Conventionally,   as  shown in Figs.   7  to  9,   a  fender lining  5   for rust  proof  is  provided between a  fender panel   2 and a bumper 3 of a vehicle and  a member on the vehicle  side, i.e.,   an apron panel   4   (see  Fig.   8).   As  shown  in Figs.   10  and 11,   this   fender  lining  5  is  substantially composed of a lining plate surface  6  disposed on a  front  side  of  the vehicle  1  and a curved surface  7.   The  lining plate  surface  6 extends   forwardly  along a  joint  portion A   (see  Fig.   8) between  the  bumper  3  and  the  fender panel   2  with  its  tip end being assembled  into  the vehicle body by a  lamp  support  panel 8   (see  Fig.   10).<br>
In this  case,   the  fender lining  5   is   fixed to the fender panel  2,   the apron panel   4  or the  like by a clip   (not shown).   In Figs.   7  to  9,   reference numeral  9  denotes  a tire. Reference numeral   10  in Figs.   7,   9  and  10 denotes a head<br>
lamp.   Also,   in Figs.   7,   9  and  10,   reference numeral   11<br>
i<br>
denotes a front hood.<br>
Incidentally, Japanese Utility Model Examined Publication No. Sho 60-39339 discloses a conventional fender protector. In this publication, in order to discharge water, that enters an air box together with air through an air introduction port of a cowl top panel from a cowl grille, to a rear end portion from above a fender protector, two partitioning walls used also as reinforcement ribs are projectingly formed on a top surface of the fender protector<br>
and a water drain path is formed between these two partitioning walls (based upon the description of lines 5 to 10 of column 3 on page 2 of the above-described publication).<br>
Also, Japanese Utility Model Examined Publication No. Sho 64-7110 discloses a mud dropping preventing structure for a fender liner. In this publication, a vertical wall rising upwardly is integrally formed over a full width at a front end portion of the fender liner provided between the fender panel and the fender apron (based upon the description of line 21 of column 2 on page 1 to line 1 of column 3 on page 2 of that publication).<br>
In the above-described pieces of prior art, as shown in Figs. 7 and 11, the muddy water W entrained by the tire 9 flows forwardly along the curved surface 7 of the fender lining 5, and as shown in Fig. 8, flows on the side of the bumper 3 from the joint surface A between the fender panel 2 and the bumper 3 and as shown in Fig. 10, flows to the front side of the bumper 3 from a joint surface B between the head lamp 10 and the bumper 3, resulting in contamination of an outer surface of the bumper 3. Thus, an appearance in the vicinity of the bumper 3 becomes worse.<br>
Incidentally, in the fender protector disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Examined Publication No. Sho 60-39339, even if the partitioning walls used as the reinforcement ribs are formed on the surface of the fender protector facing the tire, there is still a fear that the muddy water would enter the joint surface of the fender panel and the bumper.<br>
Also, in the mud dripping preventing structure of the fender liner disclosed}, in Japanese Utility Model Examined Publication No. Sho 64-7110, the muddy water that flows on the front side of the fender liner is prevented by the vertical wall provided on the fender liner to avoid the contamination of the top surface of the bumper. However, the muddy water flowing along the surface of the fender liner facing the tire would be introduced into the joint surface<br>
between the bumper and the fender panel.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a fender lining disposed between a fender panel and a bumper and a vehicle body side member, with a lining plate surface being formed on a front side, characterized in that a recess portion extending in a back-and-fourth direction of the vehicle is formed in a central portion, in a transverse direction of the vehicle, of said lining plate surface, and a bottom portion of said recess portion is formed at a lower level than that of a joint surface between said fender panel and said bumper.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION QF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An example of an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference Figs. 1 and 2 while giving the same reference numerals to the same or like components shown in Figs. 7 to 11. Fig. 1 shows a rust-proofing fender lining 15 disposed between the fender panel 2 and the bumper 3 (also refer to Figs. 7 to 9) and the vehicle side member, i.e., inside of the apron panel 4. Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view corresponding to Fig. 8 in which this fender lining 15 is provided.<br>
The fender lining 15 is substantially composed of a lining plate surface 16 and a curved surface 17. A recess portion 18 along a back-and-force direction of the vehicle is formed substantially in a central portion of this lining plate surface 16 in a transverse direction of the vehicle. A bottom portion 19 of this recess portion 18 is formed at a lower position than the joint surface A (see Fig. 2) between the fender panel 2 and the bumper 3 and at a lower position than the joint surface B (described later and see Fig. 5) between the bumper 3 and the head lamp 10.<br>
Furthermore, an outer plate surface portion 16a, located on the fender panel 2 side from the recess portion 18, of the lining plate surface 16 is slanted downwardly inside of the vehicle body, i.e., toward the recess portion 18.<br>
With such an arrangement, the muddy water W flowing forwardly along the curved surface 17 of the fender lining 15 will flow to the recess portion 18 side inside of the vehicle body from the slanted outer plate surface portion 16a of the lining plate surface 16. Since the bottom portion 19 of the recess portion 18 is formed at the lower level than that of the joint surface A between the fender panel 2 and the bumper 3 and that of the joint surface B (see Fig. 5 to be described later) between the bumper 3 and the head lamp 10, the muddy water W drops to be discharged to the lower portion of the vehicle body from the bottom portion 19 of the recess portion 18 without entering the joint surfaces A and B.<br>
In an embodiment shown in Figs. 3 and 4, vertical walls 20 in a transverse direction of the vehicle are formed on the top end portion side on the lower surface of the lining plate surface 16 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and furthermore, a side wall 21 extending in the backhand-forth direction of the vehicle is formed on the lower surface of the outer plate surface portion 16a so as to intersect with the vertical wall 20, i.e., to form an L-shape.<br>
With such an arrangement, the muddy water W flowing forwardly along the curved surface 17 of the fender lining 15 will flow to the recess portion 18 side inside of the vehicle body by the slanted outer plate surface portion 16a of the lining plate surface 16. Since the bottom portion 19 of the recess portion 18 is formed at a lower level than the joint surfaces A and B (see Fig. 5 to be described later), and furthermore, the vertical walls 20 and the side wall 21 are formed on the lining plate surface, the muddy water W will never enter the joint surfaces A and B. The muddy water W drops to the lower portion of the vehicle body to be discharged by the bottom portion 19 of the recess portion 18 and the vertical walls 20.<br>
In an embodiment shown in Figs. 5 and 6, vertical walls 20 in the traverse direction of the vehicle are<br><br>
provided on both sides on the lower surface of the lining plate 16 on the tip end portion side where the recess portion 18 is not formed, a side wall 21 extending in the back-and-forth direction of the vehicle is provided on the lower surface of the outer plate surface portion 16a on the fender panel 2 side. With such an arrangement, the muddy water W flowing forwardly along the curved surface 17 of the fender lining 15 is interrupted by the side wall 21 and the vertical walls 20 so as not to enter the joint surfaces A and B. The muddy water W drop to the lower portion of the vehicle body to be discharged by the side wall 21 and the vertical walls 20.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, the muddy water flowing forwardly along the fender lining may flow on the recess portion side inside of the vehicle body. Furthermore, since the bottom portion of the recess portion is formed at the lower level than the joint surface between the fender panel and the bumper and the joint surface between the bumper and the head lamp, it is possible the muddy water drops from the bottom portion of the above-described recess portion to the lower portion of the vehicle body to be discharged. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the muddy water from entering each joint surface described above. Thus, the outer surface of the bumper is not contaminated and the appearance may be kept well.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, the muddy water flowing forwardly along the fender lining may positively flow to the recess portion inside of the vehicle body. The muddy water may drop to the lower portion of the vehicle body to be discharged from the recess portion.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, the muddy water flowing forwardly along the fender lining may positively flow to the recess portion inside of the vehicle body and may drop the muddy water to the lower portion of the<br><br>
vehicle body to be discharged from the recess portion. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent the muddy water from entering the joint surface between the fender panel and the bumper and the joint surface between the bumper and the head lamp by the side wall and the vertical walls of the lining plate surface. Also, it is possible to discharge the muddy water flowing forwardly on the lining plate surface to the lower portion of the vehicle body by the vertical walls. Thus, the outer surface of the bumper is not contaminated and the appearance may be kept well.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present<br>
invention, it is possible to prevent the muddy water flowing forwardly along the fender lining from entering each joint portion by the side wall in the back-and-forth direction of the vehicle and the vertical walls in the transverse direction of the vehicle. Then, it si possible to drop the muddy water to the lower portion of the vehicle body by the vertical walls and the side wall to be discharged. Thus, the outer surface of the bumper is not contaminated and the appearance may be kept well.<br>
