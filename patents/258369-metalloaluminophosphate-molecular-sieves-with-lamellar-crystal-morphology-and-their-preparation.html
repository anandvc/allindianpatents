CRYSTAL MORPHOLOGY AND THEIR PREPARATION<br>
[Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to metalloaluminophosphate (MeAPO)<br>
molecular sieves with lamellar crystal morphology and their preparation. The<br>
metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves of the invention are useful as<br>
catalysts in a variety of processes including cracking, hydrocracking,<br>
isomerization, reforming, dewaxing, alkylation, transalkylation, conversion of<br>
methanol to light olefins. The limited supply and increasing cost of crude oil has<br>
prompted the search for alternative processes for producing hydrocarbon<br>
products. One such process is the conversion of oxygen-containing,<br>
halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds to<br>
hydrocarbons and especially light olefins (by light olefins is meant C2 to C4<br>
olefins) or gasoline and aromatics. The interest in the methanol to olefin (MTO)<br>
process is based on the fact that oxygenates, especially methanol can be<br>
obtained from coal, biomass, organic waste or natural gas by the production of<br>
synthesis gas which is then processed to produce methanol.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>

molecular sieve characterized in that it has predominantly a plate crystal<br>
morphology, wherein the average smallest crystal dimension is at least 0.1<br>
micron and has an aspect ratio of less than or equal to 5.<br>
US 6,334,994 relates to a microporous crystalline silico-alumino-<br>
phosphate composition, the theoretical composition of which, on a water-free<br>
basis after synthesis and calcination, is: HwSixAlyPzO2 where w and x have a<br>
value between 0.01 and 0.05 and y and z are values between 0.4 and 0.6,<br>
wherein the composition is a mixed phase product comprising silico-alumino-<br>
phosphates of AEI and CHA structure prepared in one batch crystallization, not<br>
including mere physical mixtures, the product after calcination in air at 550° C<br>

molecular sieve comprising at least one intergrown phase of molecular sieves<br>
having AEI and CHA framework types, wherein said intergrown phase has an<br>
AEI/CHA ratio of from about 5/95 to 40/60 as determined by DIFFaX analysis,<br>
using the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a calcined sample of said<br>
silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve, under conditions effective to form an<br>
olefin product.<br>
It also describes a method for preparing the molecular sieve of said<br>
process that comprises<br>

from about 120°C. to 250°C, preferably from 130°C. to 225°C, most preferably<br>
from 150°C. to 200°C. Heating up to the crystallization temperature is typically<br>
carried for a period of time ranging from about 0,5 to about 16 hours, preferably<br>
from about 1 to 12 hours, most preferably from about 2 to 9 hours. The<br>
temperature may be increased stepwise or continuously. However, continuous<br>
heating is preferred. The reaction mixture may be kept static or agitated by<br>
means of tumbling or stirring the reaction vessel during hydrothermal treatment.<br>
Preferably, the reaction mixture is tumbled or stirred, most preferably stirred.<br>
The temperature is then maintained at the crystallization temperature for a<br>
period of time ranging from 2 to 200 hours. Heat and agitation is applied for a<br>
period of time effective to form crystalline product. In a specific embodiment, the<br>
reaction mixture is kept at the crystallization temperature for a period of from 16<br>
to 96 hours.<br>
With regards to the step c), the usual means can be used. Typically,<br>
the crystalline molecular sieve product is formed as a slurry and can be<br>
recovered by standard means, such as by sedimentation, centrifugation or<br>
filtration.<br>
With regards to the step d), the separated molecular sieve product is<br>
washed, recovered by sedimentation, centrifugation or filtration and dried.<br>
With regards to the step e), calcination of molecular sieves is known<br>
per se. As a result of the molecular sieve crystallization process, the recovered<br>
molecular sieve contains within its pores at least a portion of the template used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, activation is performed in such a manner that the<br>
template is removed from the molecular sieve, leaving active catalytic sites with<br>
the microporous channels of the molecular sieve open for contact with a<br>
feedstock. The activation process is typically accomplished by calcining, or<br>
essentially heating the molecular sieve comprising the template at a<br>
temperature of from 200 to 800° C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to heat the molecular sieve in an<br>
environment having a low oxygen concentration. This type of process can be<br>
used for partial or complete removal of the template from the intracrystalline<br>
pore system.<br>
Additionally, if during the synthesis alkaline or alkaline earth metals have<br>
been used, the molecular sieve might be subjected to an ion-exchange step.<br>
Conventionally, ion-exchange is done in aqueous solutions using ammonium<br>
salts or inorganic acids.<br>
Once the molecular sieve is made, it can be used as itself as a catalyst.<br>
In another embodiment it can be formulated into a catalyst by combining the<br>
molecular sieve with other materials that provide additional hardness or catalytic<br>
activity to the finished catalyst product. This invention also relates to said<br>
catalysts consisting of the MeAPO molecular sieves of this invention or<br>
comprising the MeAPO molecular sieves of this invention.<br>
Materials which can be blended with the molecular sieve can be various<br>
inert or catalytically active materials, or various binder materials. These<br>
materials include compositions such as kaolin and other clays, various forms of<br>
rare earth metals, alumina or alumina sol, titania, zirconia, quartz, silica or silica<br>
sol, and mixtures thereof. These components are effective in densifying the<br>
catalyst and increasing the strength of the formulated catalyst. When blended<br>
with non-metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve materials, the amount of<br>
MeAPO of the present invention, which is contained in the final catalyst product<br>
ranges from 10 to 90 weight percent of the total catalyst, preferably 20 to 70<br>
weight percent of the total catalyst.<br>
The MeAPO molecular sieves of the present invention can be used to dry<br>
gases and liquids; for selective molecular separation based on size and polar<br>
properties; as ion-exchangers; as catalysts in cracking, hydrocracking,<br>
disproportionation, alkylation, isomerization, oxidation; as chemical carriers; in<br>
gas chromatography; and in the petroleum industry to remove normal paraffins<br>
from distillates. More precisely they are useful as catalysts in a variety of<br>
processes including cracking of, for example, a naphtha feed to light olefin(s) or<br>
higher molecular weight (MW) hydrocarbons to lower MW hydrocarbons;<br>
hydrocracking of, for example, heavy petroleum and/or cyclic feedstock;<br>
isomerization of, for example, aromatics such as xylene; polymerization of, for<br>
example, one or more olefin(s) to produce a oligomer product; dewaxing of, for<br>
example, hydrocarbons to remove straight chain paraffins; absorption of, for<br>
example, alkyl aromatic compounds for separating out isomers thereof;<br>
oligomerization of, for example, straight and branched chain olefin(s); and the<br>
synthesis of monoalkylamines and dialkylamines.<br>
The MeAPO of the present invention are particularly suited for the<br>
catalytic conversion of oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-<br>
containing organic compounds to hydrocarbons. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention also relates to a method for making an olefin product from an oxygen-<br>
containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic feedstock<br>
wherein said oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing<br>
organic feedstock is contacted with the catalyst of this invention comprising the<br>
molecular sieve of this invention under conditions effective to convert the<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic<br>
feedstock to olefin products. In this process a feedstock containing an oxygen-<br>
containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compound<br>
contacts the above described catalyst in a reaction zone of a reactor at<br>
conditions effective to produce light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene.<br>
Typically, the oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing<br>
organic feedstock is contacted with the catalyst when the oxygen-containing,<br>
halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds is in vapour<br>
phase. Alternately, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a mixed<br>
vapour/liquid phase. In this process, converting oxygen-containing, halogenide-<br>
containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds , olefins can generally be<br>
produced at a wide range of temperatures. An effective operating temperature<br>
range can be from about 200° C. to 700° C. At the lower end of the temperature<br>
range, the formation of the desired olefin products may become markedly slow.<br>
At the upper end of the temperature range, the process may not form an<br>
optimum amount of product. An operating temperature of at least 300° C, and<br>
up to 575° C is preferred.<br>
The pressure also may vary over a wide range. Preferred pressures are<br>
in the range of about 5 kPa to about 5 MPa, with the most preferred range being<br>
of from about 50 kPa to about 0.5 MPa. The foregoing pressures refer to the<br>
partial pressure of the oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing, sulphur-<br>
containing organic compounds and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
The process can be carried out in any system using a variety of transport<br>
beds, although a fixed bed or moving bed system could be used.<br>
Advantageously a fluidized bed is used. It is particularly desirable to operate the<br>
reaction process at high space velocities. The process can be conducted in a<br>
single reaction zone or a number of reaction zones arranged in series or in<br>
parallel. Any standard commercial scale reactor system can be used, for<br>
example fixed bed, fluidised or moving bed systems. The commercial scale<br>
reactor systems can be operated at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of<br>
from 0.1 hr-1to1000hr-1.<br>
One or more inert diluents may be present in the feedstock, for example,<br>
in an amount of from 1 to 95 molar percent, based on the total number of moles<br>
of all feed and diluent components fed to the reaction zone. Typical diluents<br>
include, but are not necessarily limited to helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, alkanes (especially<br>
methane, ethane, and propane), aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The preferred diluents are water and nitrogen. Water can be injected in either<br>
liquid or vapour form.<br>
The oxygenate feedstock is any feedstock containing a molecule or any<br>
chemical having at least an oxygen atom and capable, in the presence of the<br>
above MeAPO catalyst, to be converted to olefin products. The oxygenate<br>
feedstock comprises at least one organic compound which contains at least one<br>
oxygen atom, such as aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds<br>
(aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, esters and the like).<br>
Representative oxygenates include but are not necessarily limited to lower<br>
straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols and their unsaturated<br>
counterparts. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include, but are not<br>
limited to: methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; C4-C20 alcohols; methyl<br>
ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; formaldehyde;<br>
dimethyl carbonate; dimethyl ketone; acetic acid; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Representative oxygenates include lower straight chain or branched aliphatic<br>
alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts.<br>
Analogously to these oxygenates, compounds containing sulphur or<br>
halides may be used. Examples of suitable compounds include methyl<br>
mercaptan; dimethyl sulfide; ethyl mercaptan; di-ethyl sulfide; ethyl<br>
monochloride; methyl monochloride, methyl dichloride, n-alkyl halides, n-alkyl<br>
sulfides having n-alkyl groups of comprising the range of from about 1 to about<br>
10 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Preferred oxygenate compounds are<br>
methanol, dimethyl ether, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The method of making the olefin products from an oxygenate feedstock<br>
can include the additional step of making the oxygenate feedstock from<br>
hydrocarbons such as oil, coal, tar sand, shale, biomass and natural gas.<br>
Methods for making oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing, sulphur-<br>
containing-containing organic feedstocks are known in the art. These methods<br>
include fermentation to alcohol or ether, making synthesis gas, then converting<br>
the synthesis gas to alcohol or ether. Synthesis gas can be produced by known<br>
processes such as steam reforming, autothermal reforming and partial<br>
oxidization in case of gas feedstocks or by reforming or gasification using<br>
oxygen and steam in case of solid (coal, organic waste) or liquid feedstocks.<br>
Methanol, methylsulfide and methylhalides can be produced by oxidation of<br>
methane with the help of dioxygen, sulphur or halides in the corresponding<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic<br>
compound.<br>
One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the olefin products made by<br>
the oxygenate-to-olefin conversion reaction using the molecular sieve of the<br>
present invention can be polymerized to form polyolefins, particularly<br>
polyethylenes and polypropylenes.<br>
