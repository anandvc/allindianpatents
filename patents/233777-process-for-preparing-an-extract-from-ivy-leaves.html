				<td>Method for preparing an extract from ivy leaves and extract prepared by this process<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an extract from ivy leaves and to an<br>
extract prepared by this process.<br>
Extracts from ivy leaves are currently employed successfully in particular for the therapy<br>
of respiratory disorders because the extract shows spasmolytic, expectorant and antiob-<br>
structive effects. These effects are attributable in particular to the therapeutically important<br>
constituents of the ivy leaf extracts, which belong to the class of triterpene saponins.<br>
The chief saponin in this connection is the bisdesmosidic hederacoside C and the a-hederin<br>
which is produced therefrom by ester hydrolysis. A further saponin which has been<br>
detected is hederagenin.<br>
Since extracts from ivy leaves can be obtained by various processes, these extracts often<br>
display different potencies. This derives from the fact that the content of the constituents<br>
depends not only on the natural composition but also on the particular method for prepar-<br>
ing the extract.<br>
It has been possible to show in recent studies by the applicant that a-hederin is the really<br>
active substance in ivy leaves and contributes to the bronchospasmolysis because this<br>
substance causes relaxation of smooth muscles via binding to P-adrenergic receptors and<br>
cascades induced thereby.<br>
Extracts from plant materials - especially dry extracts - and processes for preparing such<br>
extracts are described many times in the area of pharmacy and pharmaceutical prepara-<br>
tions.<br>
One process for preparing dry extracts from plant materials is disclosed for example in<br>
DE 101 12 168 Al. It is said that the content of lipophilic and hydrophilic substances can<br>
be adjusted using the process disclosed therein. In this case, the plant material is subjected<br>
to at least two extractions with solvents of different lipophilicity, and the extracts are<br>
obtained therefrom separately. The extracts are dried separately from one another and<br>
mixed in the desired ratio. It is possible in this way to adjust the content of lipophilic and<br>
hydrophilic substances. The process is said also to be suitable for obtaining dry extracts<br>
from ivy {Hedera helix).<br>
However, this publication discloses neither an extract which has a specifically adjusted<br>
content of a-hederin and/or hederacoside C, nor a process with which such an extract<br>
could be provided.<br>
Furthermore, DE 30 25 223 Al discloses a pharmaceutical preparation based on ivy<br>
extracts and a process for the preparation thereof, where the preparations include as active<br>
ingredient a 90% or 60% hedera saponin C-containing extract or a-hederin. The extract is<br>
obtained by using acetone and methanol. In order to convert hedera saponin C or hederaco-<br>
side C into a-hederin, in order thus to obtain an extract with only a-hederin, in the said<br>
application the 90% extract is hydrolysed with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
A process with which it is possible to prepare an extract in which a-hederin and hederaco-<br>
side C are present in a content which can be adjusted as desired is, however, not disclosed<br>
in this publication either.<br>
However, in order to ensure a reproducible therapeutic effect, it is precisely desirable to<br>
have ivy extracts which have a definable content of active ingredients.<br>
A further disadvantage of extracts employed to date is that these extracts have to be<br>
administered more than once in order to have an immediate and lasting broncho-<br>
spasmolytic effect inducible by a-hederin. The reason for this may be that the bioavailabil-<br>
ity of a-hederin is insufficient because, for example, the a-hederin content present in the<br>
extract is too low at the start of intake. On the other hand, a-hederin originally present in<br>
the extract is also absorbed relatively quickly in vivo, making multiple administrations<br>
necessary in order to achieve a therapeutic effect.<br>
Taking account of the above statements, it is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a process for preparing an extract, and an extract by which a rapid bioavailability<br>
of a-hederin and maintenance of the bioavailability over a prolonged period is ensured.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is achieved by preparing an extract from ivy<br>
leaves having an adjustable content of hederacoside C and a-hederin, where the process<br>
includes the following steps:<br>
a)    provision of a first, a-hederin-rich extract;<br>
b)         provision of a second, hederacoside C-rich extract; and<br>
c)         blending the first and the second extract to give an extract which has an adjusted<br>
hederacoside C content and an adjusted a-hederin content.<br>
It is possible with the process of the invention to obtain an extract which on the one hand<br>
has a-hederin available as immediately acting substance, and on the other hand also<br>
hederacoside C, which is converted into a-hederin in vivo. Moreover the first extract<br>
includes a-hederin and the second extract includes hederacoside C, in each case in highly<br>
enriched form.<br>
The first extract can in this connection be prepared for example by the starting material, for<br>
example the dried herb, firstly being comminuted and subjected to a fermentation step, and<br>
thereafter being preswollen and extracted for example in an alcohol/water mixture, for<br>
example 30% ethanol. Finally, it is possible for example for a thin-film vaporization and a<br>
spray drying to take place. Depending on the desired a-hederin content, the whole herb can<br>
be fermented - in this way all the hederacoside C present in the starting plant material is<br>
converted into a-hederin. On the other hand, it is also possible for only part of the starting<br>
plant material to be fermented, and the remaining parts to be admixed only for the preswel-<br>
ling in ethanol - a-hederin only is present greatly enriched thereby.<br>
"Fermentation" means herein the breakdown or the conversion of constituents present in an<br>
original substance into other substances by addition of a fermentation medium, for exam-<br>
ple water, to the original substance, with particular parameters, for example time and<br>
temperature, being adjusted where appropriate to the fermentation process. This novel<br>
fermentation step opens up the possibility of specifically preparing a-hederin-rich extracts.<br>
The ivy leaves can in this connection be employed for example as dried herb. Dried herbs<br>
have the advantage in the preparation of pharmaceuticals that they are in some circum-<br>
stances easier to handle in terms of stability than are fresh herbs. Nevertheless, the use of<br>
fresh ivy leaves is not precluded for the extract of the invention.<br>
Dried medicinal plants and parts of medicinal plants are referred to as "herbs" by definition<br>
in the area of pharmaceutical technology. The use of such medicinal plants in the form of<br>
"herbs" can moreover take place either in unaltered or in comminuted form.<br>
The second extract can be prepared for example by the dried herb being mixed immedi-<br>
ately after cutting with an extractant, for example 30% ethanol, and being extracted by<br>
conventional methods. Alternatively, the comminuted herb can - before the ethanol extrac-<br>
tion - be steamed with superheated steam. Experiments by the inventors have shown that it<br>
was possible via this treatment for the content of hederacoside C in the extract to be<br>
increased, or stabilized in relation to the initial content, and the a-hederin content to be<br>
reduced. In these ways, extracts which can be employed as second, hederacoside C-rich<br>
extract in step b) of the process of the invention are obtained. This novel steaming step<br>
opens up the possibility of specifically preparing hederacoside C-rich extracts.<br>
It is moreover particularly preferred in the process if the a-heder in-rich extract in step a)<br>
has an a-hederin content of at least 3%, in particular of 5%.<br>
It is further preferred for the hederacoside C-rich extract in step b) to have a hederacoside<br>
C content of at least 5%, and in particular a hederacoside C content of at least 10% and an<br>
a-hederin content of less than 2%.<br>
It is moreover preferred if in the process the extract to be obtained in step c) has a hedera-<br>
coside C content of about 3 to about 10%, in particular of about 6.5%, and an a-hederin<br>
content of about 1 to about 7%, in particular of about 4.0%.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is further achieved by an extract which is<br>
prepared by the process of the invention. In particular, the object on which the invention is<br>
based is achieved by an extract, prepared by the process of the invention, from ivy leaves<br>
having an adjusted hederacoside C content of about 3% to about 10%, in particular of<br>
about 6.5%, and an adjusted a-hederin content of about 1% to about 7%, in particular of<br>
about 4.0%.<br>
This is because the extract of the invention has the advantage, owing to the adjusted<br>
content of the said active ingredients, that after a use of the extract the active ingredient a-<br>
hederin is initially made available rapidly through the a-hederin which is present as such<br>
in the extract. The hederacoside C which is present in the extract in addition to a-hederin is<br>
moreover absorbed in vivo with a time lag, and is gradually converted into a-hederin, so<br>
that after the originally present a-hederin has been used up, the a-hederin converted from<br>
hederacoside C is available. This ensures in an advantageous manner that the therapeutic<br>
efficacy of the extract, or of the medicament including the extract, is longer.<br>
The inventors have demonstrated this process in their own experiments. In this connection,<br>
they showed that it was possible with an extract of the invention, in which the a-hederin<br>
and hederacoside C active ingredient content was adjusted in the abovementioned optimal<br>
range, to achieve a rapid rise in level and maintenance of a constant concentration. A<br>
comparative extract having a higher hederacoside C content and a lower a-hederin content<br>
had to be administered more frequently than the extract of the invention in order to achieve<br>
comparable concentration levels. Accordingly, it is possible with the novel extract to attain<br>
even by a single administration an a-hederin concentration which is desirable for use for<br>
bronchospasmolysis.<br>
It is especially preferred in this connection for the extract to be prepared by the process of 1<br>
the invention, and to have a hederacoside C content of about 6.5% and an a-hederin          I<br>
content of about 4.0%.                                                                                                 <br>
The invention further relates to the use of the extract of the invention for preparing a<br>
medicament, in particular for the treatment of respiratory disorders, and to a medicament<br>
which includes the extract of the invention.<br>
The extracts of the invention with an adjusted content of the hederacoside C and a-hederin<br>
constituents are particularly advantageous in the use as medicaments because reproducible<br>
therapeutic effects can be achieved with them and, in addition, an immediate provision of<br>
the active ingredient a-hederin with spasmolytic activity is made possible, and the provi-<br>
sion is maintained constant over a prolonged period.<br>
The medicament of the invention can accordingly be employed for the treatment of respira-<br>
tory disorders such as, for example, infectious inflammatory respiratory disorders such as,<br>
for example, pneumonia, tracheitis, bronchitis etc., but also for obstructive and restrictive<br>
pulmonary disorders such as chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, bronchiectases etc., i.e.<br>
for respiratory disorders in which relaxation of smooth muscles is desired.<br>
The medicament may be in the form of capsules, tablets, coated tablets, suppositories,<br>
granules, powders, solutions, creams, emulsions, aerosols, ointments and oils. Oral admini-<br>
stration forms are particularly preferred in this connection. The medicament may moreover<br>
include excipients which are conventionally used in preparing medicaments. A number of<br>
suitable substances is to be found for example in A. Kibbe, Handbook of Pharmaceutical<br>
Excipients, 3rd ed. 2000, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pharmaceutical Press.<br>
Further advantages are evident from the example and the appended figure, which shows:<br>
Fig. 1              the hydrolysis of hederacoside C to a-hederin.<br>
It will be appreciated that the features which are mentioned above and are to be explained<br>
hereinafter can be used not only in the particular combination indicated but also in other<br>
combinations or alone, without leaving the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example<br>
1 •         Absorption characteristics of ivy leaf constituents in vivo (rats')<br>
It was possible to show in an absorption study by means of the biopharmaceutics<br>
classification system (BCS) that a-hederin is to be attributed with a moderate ab-<br>
sorption (10-90%). Under the same conditions, hederacoside C did not permeate<br>
through the membranes, for which reason a possible absorption of hederacoside C<br>
in the form of a-hederin was to be investigated. Absorption studies were carried<br>
out on rats for this purpose.<br>
The influence of administration of two different extracts on the plasma concentra-<br>
tion of a-hederin was subsequently investigated. The change in the plasma concen-<br>
tration of a-hederin with a single administration compared with multiple admini-<br>
stration of the extract and with different blood sampling times after administration<br>
was also investigated, as was the a-hederin absorption rate. Two extracts whose<br>
saponin distribution is shown in Table 1 below were selected for this purpose:<br>
Table 1: Saponin distribution of the extracts<br>
	Hederacoside C content [%]	a-Hederin content [%]<br>
Extract A	14.5	0.9<br>
Extract B	6.5	4.0<br>
For intravenous administration, the required amount of extract was dissolved in 11%<br>
(m/m) ethanol, filtered and injected. It was aimed to administer a volume of 2 ml of<br>
extract solution (dose in each case [mg/kg of bodyweighf]: 25). A blood sample<br>
was taken from the animals 5 minutes after the administration. About 2 ml of whole<br>
blood with added EDTA for anticoagulation were required for each sample.<br>
Suspensions of the extracts in glycerol were prepared for oral administration. The<br>
animals were gavaged with about 2 ml of these suspensions (dose in each case<br>
[mg/kg of bodyweight]: 1000 and 166.66). 2 ml of blood were taken from each of<br>
the animals 1 and 3 hours after the last administration in each case. The animals had<br>
an average weight of about 200 g and a blood volume of about 20 ml.<br>
The results of the analyses are shown in Table 2 below:<br>
Table 2:    Summary of administration/a-hederin plasma concentration<br>
Hederacoside C was not detectable in any sample. As can be inferred from Table 2<br>
above, the measured a-hederin plasma concentration on multiple administration of<br>
an extract of lower a-hederin content is higher than on comparable administration of<br>
an extract richer in a-hederin. This result was explicable by a recalculation which<br>
is shown in Table 3 below:<br>
The total saponin content takes account of the molar masses of the two constituents<br>
and is based on a-hederin. The total saponin content in extract A in this case was<br>
9.8%, based on a-hederin. A blood volume of 20 ml was assumed.<br>
The calculations for extract B are shown in Table 4 below:<br>
Table 4:    Absorption rates for administration of extract B (6.5% hederacoside C<br>
and 4.0% a-hederin)<br>
The total saponin content takes account of the molar masses of the two constituents<br>
and is based on a-hederin. The total saponin content in extract B in this case was<br>
9.8%, based on a-hederin. A blood volume of 20 ml was assumed.<br>
In summary, it can be said that multiple administration of an a-hederin-rich and of<br>
an a-hederin-poor extract led to comparable a-hederin plasma concentrations.<br>
However, if the hederacoside C content of the two extracts is taken into account,<br>
and the total content of the two saponins is determined, calculated as a-hederin, the<br>
two extracts differ only slightly. It must be assumed on the basis of these results<br>
that elimination of the sugar located at C28 of hederacoside C takes place in vivo<br>
and results in absorbable a-hederin. This process - i.e. conversion of hederacoside<br>
C into a-hederin - is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
It can be assumed from the in vitro demonstration of a spasmolytic activity of<br>
a-hederin in contrast to hederacoside C and the recovery of a-hederin in the plasma<br>
in contrast to hederacoside C that the a-hederin concentration in the blood corre-<br>
lates decisively with the therapeutic effect demonstrated in many clinical studies.<br>
Using an extract which is optimized in relation to the therapeutic effect ought there-<br>
fore to result rapidly in a uniform plasma concentration, which is also maintained<br>
on multiple administration of the extract. Extract B represents such an extract, and<br>
administration thereof- in contrast to extract A - leads after only one hour to a<br>
plasma concentration which is comparable with the plasma concentration after mul-<br>
tiple administration. Extract B with a content of 6.5% hederacoside C and 4.0%<br>
a-hederin was notable for a rapid onset of action and for reproducibility of the<br>
therapeutic effect.<br>
The range of content of hederacoside C and a-hederin in an extract which is opti-<br>
mal for the therapeutic effect can therefore be stated on the basis of extract B as fol-<br>
lows:<br>
Hederacoside C:          5 - 8%<br>
a-Hederin:                   3 - 5%<br>
2.         Preparation of an optimized ivy extract<br>
The optimized ivy extract is notable for a range of contents which is batch-<br>
consistent within certain limits - based on the constituents hederacoside C and<br>
a-hederin. The specified content of hederacoside C should in this connection be 50<br>
to 80 mg/g, and that of a-hederin should be 30 to 50 mg/g. A plurality of extracts<br>
were mixed in order to comply with these specifications. The extracts, which were<br>
obtained by conventional processes, are, however, only conditionally suitable for<br>
such mixing processes because their content of the relevant active ingredient is of-<br>
ten insufficiently high.<br>
Extraction processes leading to ivy leaf extracts which are notable in each case for<br>
a high content of one of the two hedera saponins, while the respective other hedera<br>
saponin is at the same time present only in very small<br>
amounts, are described below.<br>
a)         Preparation of an a-hederin-rich extract<br>
The basis for controlling the ratio of hederacoside C to a-hederin in this extraction<br>
process is specific inclusion of elimination of the sugar located at C28 of hederaco-<br>
side C in the extraction process. Since conversion of hederacoside C into a-hederin<br>
proceeds almost quantitatively, virtually any batch of leaves is suitable as starting<br>
material for preparing an a-hederin-rich extract.<br>
After quality testing and release by the quality control department, part of the herb<br>
(ivy leaves DAC) was highly comminuted in a mill, a maximum size of the frag-<br>
ments of 2 x 2 mm being guaranteed by a protective screen. In addition, the<br>
screened material was checked visually for larger particles and contaminants.<br>
The aqueous portion of 6 parts of extractant (30% (m/m) ethanol) was added to the<br>
comminuted sample. This mixture was fermented at 30°C with occasional mix-<br>
ing/agitation for 60 min.<br>
The 96% ethanol portion of 6 parts of extractant was then added, and the mixture<br>
was homogenized by stirring.<br>
After a 6-hour preswelling phase, the eluate was removed and the remaining herb<br>
was percolated with the remaining 6 parts of the extractant.<br>
The combined eluates were filtered once again to exclude small herb particles and<br>
were homogenized before they were dried by thin-film vaporization at 55°C and<br>
150 mbar to give the concentrate. This was homogenized and then dried by spray<br>
drying at 45 to 60°C to give the ivy leaf dry extract.<br>
To check this preparation process, the following extracts were prepared: starting<br>
from ivy leaves with a content of 3.91% hederacoside C and 0.20% a-hederin, an<br>
extract was produced once by the conventional method (comminution of the dried<br>
sample with addition immediately thereafter of 30% (m/m) ethanol and extraction)<br>
and once by the novel method. Table 5 below shows the chromatographic results<br>
for the content of a-hederin and hederacoside C:<br>
Table 5:    Content of a-hederin and hederacoside C in the extracts<br>
As is evident from the table, it was possible with the novel extraction process to<br>
convert the hederacoside C present in the leaves completely into a-hederin.<br>
Since the total saponin content, calculated as hederacoside C, is also of the same<br>
order of magnitude, it is possible - with knowledge of the appropriate saponin con-<br>
centration in the herb and taking account of the enrichment factor of about 2 to 3 -<br>
to estimate the final a-hederin content in the extract.<br>
In order to convert only part of the hederacoside C present in the herb into<br>
a-hederin, it is accordingly possible to subject only a certain portion of the herb to<br>
the fermentation with water, with all the other parameters remaining constant. After<br>
the 60-minute fermentation is complete, the remaining herb and the ethanol is then<br>
added for the 6-hour preswelling. The final a-hederin content in the extract can be<br>
estimated with knowledge of the appropriate saponin concentration in the herb and<br>
taking account of the enrichment factor of about 2-3.<br>
It is accordingly possible with the process of the invention to alter markedly the<br>
range of constituents of an ivy leaf dry extract by introducing a fermentation with-<br>
out a great expenditure of time and resources. Not the least of the effects is the<br>
benefit for the efficacy of the extract through the specific influence on the a-<br>
hederin content in a dry extract, or medicament, owing to the numerous publica-<br>
tions on the efficacy of a-hederin.<br>
b)    Preparation of ivy leaf dry extracts with increased hederacoside C content<br>
The basis for controlling the ratio of hederacoside C to a-hederin is specifically to<br>
suppress the elimination of the sugar located at C28 of hederacoside C during the<br>
extraction process. Care should be taken in the selection of the batch of herbs that<br>
leaf batches with a low a-hederin content are employed. A specification of less than<br>
0.5% of a-hederin based on the dried herb is advisable.<br>
A homogeneous sample of ivy leaves was analysed for the content of the two<br>
saponins as follows:<br>
Hederacoside C:    6.37%<br>
a-Hederin:                0.85%<br>
In each case three extractions were carried out starting from the herb by the follow-<br>
ing extraction method:<br>
3 g of the dried herb which had been comminuted to about 3X3 mm were steamed<br>
with superheated steam for a few seconds. The herb treated in this way was<br>
preswollen with 18 g of the extractant (30% (m/m) ethanol) for about 6 hours. After<br>
the miscella had been drained off, the remaining herb was percolated with a further<br>
18 g of the extractant. This miscella was dried in a vacuum drying oven. Alterna-<br>
tively, the drying can take place for example by thin-film vaporization at, for ex-<br>
ample, 55°C and 150 mbar and subsequent spray drying at 45-60°C.<br>
The extraction temperature is preferably between about 20 and about 40°C, in par-<br>
ticular at about 30°C. The ratio of herb to extractant is in this case for example<br>
1:12.<br>
After analysis of the resulting extracts it was possible to record the results detailed<br>
in Table 6 below:<br>
Table 6:      Con Sample	tent of hederacosid Hederacoside C content [%]	e C and a-heder a-Hederin content [%]	in in the steamed extracts Content of hedera saponins calculated as hederacoside C [%]<br>
Initial herb	6.37	0.85	7.75<br>
Extract steamed 1	14.33	0.85	15.71<br>
Extract steamed 2	14.26	0.85	15.64<br>
Extract steamed 3	14.57	0.71	15.72<br>
Leaf dry extracts prepared by this method accordingly had the a-hederin amount<br>
maximally present in the leaves employed. Thus, overall, storage-stable extracts<br>
with a high hederacoside C content and very low a-hederin content were obtained.<br>
On use of batches of leaves with a content of less than 0.5% a-hederin, it is also<br>
possible to assume a maximum a-hederin content of 0.5% for the resulting extract.<br>
c)  Mixing the two enriched extracts<br>
It is possible by means of extraction processes described under 2a) and<br>
2b) to prepare Ivy leaf extracts each of which contain one of the two<br>
hedera saponins in enriched form.<br>
Finally, the two enriched extracts are used to prepare a mixture for the<br>
final special extract with a content of 5-8% hederacoside C and 3-5% a-<br>
hederln.<br>
Example;<br>
1 part of extract A with abou 7.5 % a-hederin +<br>
1 part of extract B with about 13.0% hederacoside C and 0.5% a-hederln<br>
Extract with 6.5% hederacoside C and 4.0% a-hederin,<br>
This calculation must of course be adjusted each time for the levels of<br>
content of the two enriched extracts, but adjustment of the two enriched<br>
extracts to the concentrations mentioned in the example by mixing<br>
different enriched extracts is also conceivable.<br>
It Is now possible to formulate a medicament which ensures even with a<br>
single administration, that the actual active Ingredient (a-hederin) is<br>
rapidly available in the body. The simultaneously high hederacoside C<br>
content means that a high a-hederin level can be maintained for a long<br>
time because the hederacoside C is continuously converted into a<br>
because the hederacoside C is continuously converted into a-hederin in<br>
the body.<br>
This means that the medicament need not be taken more than once,<br>
which increases patient compliance. Respiratory disorders which<br>
frequently occur in children are one area of use of ivy extracts. Since<br>
children are often reluctant to take medicaments, successful treatment Is<br>
now possible with fewer administrator.<br>
The biological material used in the process according to the invention has<br>
(not been procured from any natural resources of India.<br>
