"HIGH ACCURACY SYNCHRONIZATION OF TEST EQUIPMENT"<br>
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a company incorporated in the state of Delaware, United States of America, of 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714, U.S.A.,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
HIGH-.ACCURACY SYNCHRONIZATION OF TEST EQUIPMENT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS <br>
[0001]    This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/527,989, filed December 8, 2003, entitled "HIGH ACCURACY SYNCHRONIZATION OF TEST EQUIPMENT".<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]    The present disclosure relates to measuring the time delay between two signals, and more particularly to measuring the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal using conventional test equipment.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]    The demand for locating the position of a mobile wireless device, such as a cellular phone, is on the rise. For instance, a mandate by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires that the location of a caller dialing 911 on his/her cellular phone be identified with an accuracy of 400 feet when the 911 call is received. A widely known method for determining the position of a mobile wireless device uses the information obtained from the Global Positioning System (GPS).<br>
[0004]    The GPS is a satellite-based navigational system formed by a network of satellites broadcasting pseudo-random noise (PRN) codes modulated on a carrier band. The GPS satellites transmit signals from which mobile GPS receivers may estimate their locations. Each GPS satellite transmits signals using two carrier signals. The first carrier signal is modulated using two PRN codes, namely a coarse acquisition (C/A) code, and a precise (P) code. Each GPS satellite uses different PRN codes to distinguish it from the other satellites of the GPS.<br>
[0005]    To determine the location of a GPS receiver, acquisition and tracking of at least four satellite signals are required. GPS signal acquisition often involves computing the correlation between the received GPS signals and the C/A code of associated satellites at various phase offsets and Doppler-shifted frequencies. Following signal acquisition, a signal tracking process decodes the signals from the identified satellites at the phase offsets and Doppler-shifted frequencies. During the signal tracking phase, navigation data is received from the identified satellites. Embedded in the navigation data transmitted by the GPS satellites are data related to satellite positioning as well as<br><br>
clock timing (i.e., time stamp), commonly referred to as ephemeris data, from which the position of the GPS receiver is detected. Many techniques have been developed to acquire and track GPS signals and to read the ephemeris data so as to detect the location of the GPS receiver.<br>
[0006]    GPS-based position detection systems, however, have a number of disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that a GPS receiver must have a clear and unobstructed view of at least four GPS satellites in order to have its position detected accurately. Therefore, if a user of a GPS receiver is, for example, in a wooded or an urban area containing tall structures, the user may not have an obstructed view of the required number of satellites to be able to detect its position. The problem may further be compounded if the user is indoors.<br>
[0007]    To detect the position of a wireless receiver when fewer than four satellites are in clear view, algorithms have been developed that use the CDMA signals transmitted by the ground base stations. Communication between a wireless device and a base station is often established by a forward link via which signals are transmitted from the base station to the wireless device, and a reverse link via which the signals transmitted from the wireless device are received by the base station. One known algorithm developed for detecting the position of a mobile wireless device using ground base stations is referred to as Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (AFLT). To detect the position of a mobile wireless device using AFLT, the location of the base stations disposed in the wireless network, the transmission times of the signals from the base stations as well as the arrival times of the signals at the mobile wireless device are required.<br>
[0008]    The front-end processing delays in a base station is often different from that in a GPS satellite transmitter. Accordingly, differences between the time of arrivals of corresponding CDMA and GPS signals need to be accounted for if both the CDMA and GPS signals are used together to detect the position of the mobile wireless device. CDMA signals transmitted by base stations are typically required to be synchronized to within 10 microseconds of their counterpart GPS signals.<br>
[0009]    For accurate position determination using both CDMA and GPS signals, the timing delay between the transmissions of the CDMA and GPS signals has to be known. Such a timing delay is measured during a CDMA base station calibration phase using<br>
-3-<br><br>
-3-<br>
conventional off-the-shelf test equipment. Typical off-the-shelf test equipment often use timing synchronization clocks that have frequencies between approximately 10MHz to 20 MHz (i.e., periods between 50 nsec to 100 nsec ). Therefore, each such delay measurement made by these equipments has a resolution of approximately 50-100 nsec and thus may lead to inaccurate position determination measurements.<br>
[0010]    Accordingly, there is a need for a technique that uses conventional off-the-shelf test equipments that use approximately 10-20 MHz clocks for timing synchronization and that enable the delay between corresponding CDMA and GPS signals to be measured with a relatively higher accuracy.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011 ]    In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, to determine the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal, a GPS receiver receives the GPS signal via an antenna and generates a first reference signal that is locked to true GPS time. The first reference signal is applied to CDMA base station test equipment which also receives the CDMA signal via an antenna. In response, the CDMA base station test equipment generates a second reference signal which has transitions occurring substantially concurrently with transitions of an internal synchronization clock used to sample the first reference signal. The CDMA base station test equipment provides the delay between the second reference signal and the CDMA signal. A frequency/time counter receives the first reference signal and the second reference signal and provides the delay between^ these two signals. The sum of the delays between the second reference signal and the CDMA signal—as provided by the CDMA base station test equipment—and the delay between the first reference signal and the second reference signal —as provided by the time/frequency counter—represents the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of the CDMA signal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019]    In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, to determine the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal, a GPS receiver receives the GPS signal via an antenna and generates a first reference signal that is locked to true GPS time. The first reference signal is applied to CDMA base station test equipment which also receives the CDMA signal via an antenna. In response, the CDMA base station test equipment generates a second reference signal which has transitions occurring substantially concurrently with transitions of an internal synchronization clock used to sample the first reference signal. The CDMA base station test equipment provides the delay between the second reference signal and the CDMA signal. A frequency/time counter receives the first reference signal and the second reference signal and provides the delay between these two signals. The sum of the<br>
-5-<br><br>
delays between the second reference signal and the CDMA signal—as provided by the CDMA base station test equipment-and the delay between the first reference signal and the second reference signal —as provided by the time/frequency counter—represents the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of the CDMA signal.<br>
[0020]    Fig. 1 is a simplified high-level block diagram of a GPS receiver 10 coupled to a CDMA base station transmitter 20. GPS receiver 10 receives the GPS signals via GPS receive antenna 15 and CDMA base station transmitter 20 transmits CDMA signals via CDMA transmit antenna 25. In order to use a time of arrival measurement of a CDMA signal in a position computation, the time at which the CDMA signal is transmitted from the transmit antenna 25 has to be known in relation to the GPS time and with a relatively high degree of accuracy. This time is referred to as the forward link calibration value and is a measure of the timing of the transmission of the CDMA signals from base station 20 relative to the GPS time.<br>
[0021]    Fig. 1 also shows various components of time delays that contribute to the forward link calibration value. Often, during a forward link calibration, these delays, discussed further below, are measured and recorded in the base station almanac. Time delay T1 represents the cable delay associated with GPS receive antenna 15. Time delay T2 represents the difference between the GPS time of the signal applied to the RF input terminal of GPS receiver 10 and the reference signal generated by GPS receiver 10. Time delay T2 is often relatively small and negligible and thus may not need to be taken into account. Time delay T3 represents the delay associated with the cable delivering the reference signal generated by GPS receiver 10 to base station transmitter 20. Time delay T4 represents the difference between the reference input signal applied to base station transmitter 20 and the CDMA system time present at the RF output terminal of base station transmitter 20. Time delay T5 represents the cable delay associated with CDMA receive antenna 25.<br>
[0022]    As is known to those skilled in the art, many techniques exits for determining the forward link calibration value described above. In accordance with some techniques, when access to a base station equipment is available, individual delay components that contribute to this value, as described above, may be measured. In accordance with other techniques, when access to the base station is not readily available, a single measurement directed at measuring the forward link calibration value may be made. The<br>
-6<br><br>
following is a description of the measurements made during a calibration phase of base station transmitter 20 without the need to measure the individual components of delay described above. During this calibration, the transmission time of the CDMA signals with respect to true GPS time is measured.<br>
[0023]    Fig. 2 is a high-level block diagram of a test set-up 50 that is used to measure the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal with a high resolution, e.g., 10 nsec, in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to calibrate the timing of the transmission of the CDMA signals relative to the GPS time. In this exemplary embodiment, test set-up 50 is shown as including a GPS receiver 60, CDMA base station test equipment 70, and a time/frequency counter 80. Each of GPS receiver 60, CDMA base station test equipment 70 and time/frequency counter 80 may be a conventional off-the-shelf test equipment and commercially available from a number of vendors. In some embodiments, the GPS receiver 60 may be a Symmetricom model No. 58503B GPS receiver, available from Symmetricom Corporation located at 2300 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, California 95131. CDMA base station test equipment 70 may be an Agilent model No. E6380A CDMA base station test equipment, available from Agilent Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94303. Frequency/time counter 80 may be a Hewlett-Packard model No. 53131A/53132A frequency/time counter, available from Hewlett-Packard located at Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California 94304-1185. It is understood, however, that many other commercially available test equipments may be used, in accordance with the present disclosure, to measure the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal with a relatively high resolution, e.g., 10 nsec.<br>
[0024]    GPS receiver 60 has a GPS receive antenna 64 adapted to receive the GPS signals. GPS receiver 60 generates a 10MHz timing clock signal CLK at its first output terminal OUT1 and a reference signal REF, commonly referred to as an even-second signal, at its second output terminal OUT2. A transition appears on signal REF every two seconds. Signal REF is locked to the received GPS signals and thus maintains a fixed timing relationship therewith. Both signals CLK and REF are applied to CDMA base station test equipment 70 at its respective input terminals IN1and EST?. CDMA base station test equipment 70 has a receive antenna 74 via which it receives the CDMA signals. CDMA base station test equipment 70 generates, in part, a reference signal REF2 at its output terminal OUT1 and that is applied to input terminal IN3 of<br><br><br><br>
time/frequency counter 80. Signals INTCLK and REF are respectively applied to input terminals IN) and BM2 of time/frequency counter 80. CDMA base station test equipment receiver 70 and time/frequency counter 80 are also coupled to one another via a GPIB interface. The 10MHz timing clock signal CLK provides a common clock for all of the test equipment.<br>
[0025]    During a calibration phase, GPS receiver 60 is optionally programmed with the known position of the user and is also programmed to have a settling time of, e.g., approximately 60 minutes. The programming of these values maybe done with a computer connected via a standard serial port and using vendor-supplied software. In these embodiments, GPS receiver 60 is also configured to also output the timing error between signal REF and the true GPS time, in the event the user finds the 60 minutes settling time inconvenient.<br>
[0026]    To receive CDMA signals that have minimized interference from the signals transmitted by various other sectors of the base station with which CDMA base station test equipment 70 is in communications with, CDMA receive antenna 74 is optionally a directional antenna. Directional antenna 74 also enables CDMA base station test equipment 70 to receive CDMA signals that have minimized interference from signals transmitted by other base stations and signals that have minimized nrultipath interference. CDMA antenna cable 72 optionally has a length that enables the CDMA receive antenna 74 to be moved in various positions in each sector of any given base station without the need to move the remainder of test setup 50.<br>
[0027J    Some embodiments of CDMA base station test equipment 70, such as Agilent E6380A, include software configured to control and read output results generated by time/frequency counter 80 as well as those generated by base station test equipment 70. The software from Agilent 6830A also provides a measurement of the base station calibration, including compensation for the time bias and various other cable delays. The software is further configured to receive, as inputs, the delay associated with GPS receive antenna cable 62, CDMA receive antenna cable 72, and cable 92 coupling output terminal OUT2 of GPS receiver 60 to input terminal IN2 of CDMA base station test equipment 70. The delay associated with cables 94 and 96 may be ignored if these two cables are selected to have equal lengths.<br><br><br><br><br>
-8-<br>
[0028]    Figure 3 shows the relative positions of GPS receive antenna 64, CDMA receive antenna 74 and base station transmit antenna 94 during base station sector calibration phase. GPS receive antenna 64 is set up so as to have an unobstructed view of the sky from 10 to 90 degrees above the horizon and from 0 to 360 degrees from the true north. If an unobstructed view of the sky is not achieved, the default elevation mask of 10 degrees of Symmetricorn 58503B is changed to an elevation that has an unobstructed view of the sky from 0 to 360 degrees from true north. The latitude, longitude, and height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid of the GPS receive antenna 64 may be optionally obtained from a differential GPS receiver. The required precision for the position of the GPS receive antenna 64 during the calibration phase is within, e.g., less than one meter of the true position. The directional CDMA receive antenna 74 is set up so as to have a line of sight to the base station transmit antenna 94 and is recommended to be within 30 degrees of the sector orientation.<br>
[0029]    The latitude, longitude, and height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid of the base station transmit antenna 94 is obtained from the GPS receive antenna 64 position and the relative azimuth, elevation, and distance of the GPS receive antenna 64 to the base station transmit antenna 94. The precision with which the position of the base station transmit antenna 94 is obtained during the calibration phase is, e.g., less than one meter of the true position. The relative azimuth, elevation, and distance of the GPS receive antenna 64 to the base station transmit antenna 94 may be obtained using a laser sight and compass. Commercially available differential GPS receivers with coupling laser sight/compass may be used to determine the position of the base station transmit antenna 94 as described above. The precision with which the distance between the CDMA receive antenna 74 and the base station transmit antenna 94 is determined is also, e.g., one meter.<br>
[0030]    Figure 4 shows a timing diagram of signals used to determine the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal as generated by test setup 50 of Fig. 2. As described above, signal REF has a period of 2 seconds and is locked to true GPS time. As seen from Fig. 2, signal REF is generated by GPS receiver 60 and is applied to CMDA base station test equipment 70. Signal INT_CLK is a reference clock internal to the CDMA base station test equipment used to generate other clocks (not shown) and synchronize CMDA base station test equipment 70 to external timing sources. Signal REFIN is generated internally within CDMA base station test<br><br>
-9-<br>
equipment 70. As shown in Fig. 4, a transition 106 occurs on signal REF_JN when signal INT_CLK makes a low-to-high transition 104. Therefore, signal REFEN may be generated internally by applying, for example, signal REF to a data input terminal of a flip-flop (not shown) and signal INT_CLK to a clock input terminal of that flip-flop; signal REFJTN is the output signal of such a flip-flop. Accordingly, transition 106 of signal REF_IN appears concurrently with transition 104 of signal TNT_CLK regardless of the time at which transition 100 of signal REF appears between transitions 102 and 104 of signal INT_CLK.<br>
[0031]    CDMA base station test equipment 70 receives CDMA signal 108 via its CDMA receive antenna 74. As shown in Fig. 4, the delay Ts between the arrival time of the CDMA signal—represented by transition 108 of signal CDMA—and true GPS time-represented by transition 100 of signal REF—includes time delay T&amp;, which is the delay between transitions 100 and 106, and time delay T7, which is the delay between transitions 106 and 108. Conventional off-the-shelf CDMA base station test equipments, such as CDMA base station test equipment 70 only supply delay component T-7 of time delay T2. Therefore, they do not take into account delay component T6, which changes depending on the relationship between true GPS time and the signal INT_CLKL. Because signal DSTTCLK has a period of approximately 50 nsec or 100 nsec, delay component T§ may vary from 0 to 50 nsec or from 0 to 100 nsec. In other words, the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of the CDMA signal as measured by CDMA base station test equipment 70 may be off by up to 50 nsec or 100 nsec depending on the frequency of signal INTCLK, thus leading to unreliable base station calibration and/or position determination.<br>
[0032]    In accordance with the present disclosure, delay component T6 between transitions 100 of signal REF and 106 of signal REFIN is measured, as described below, to improve the accuracy with which time delay T2 is measured. Conventional off-the-shelf CDMA base station test equipment, such as Agilent E6380A, generates a number of clock signals internally. One such internally generated clock signal that is synchronous and has a relatively small time delay with respect to signals REF_IN and INT_CLK is a 1.2288 MHz clock signal, shown as signal REF2 in Figs. 2 and 4. In Fig. 4, transition 110 of signal REF2, transition 106 of signal REF IN, and transition 104 of signal INT CLK occur concurrently and at substantially the same time. Therefore, the<br><br>
delay T6 between transitions 100 and 106 is substantially the same as that between transitions 100 and 110.<br>
[0033]    As seen from Fig. 2, to measure the time delay T6 between transitions 100 and 110, in accordance with the present disclosure, signals REF and REF2 are applied to time/frequency counter 80. Time/frequency counter 80 which as described above, may be an Hewlett-Packard model no. 53131A/53132A time/frequency counter, is configured to measure time delay T6.<br>
[0034]    To further simplify the measurement of the delay between the REF and the CDMA signal, a fourth tester with an HP-IB interface (not shown) may be coupled to both CDMA base station test equipment 70 and time/frequency counter 80. The HP interface of such equipment enables it to read and sum the time delay T6 and T7 and display the sum, i.e., T8, on a monitor.<br>
[0035] In some embodiments, CDMA base station test equipment 70 may be adapted to include time/frequency 80 as well as hardware/software modules to sum time delays T6 and T7, and to display the sum on a monitor. In other embodiments, signal REF2 may be a signal other than the internally generated 1.2288 MHz. In yet other embodiments, both the GPS receiver and the CDMA base station test equipment may be placed in the same housing and be made commercially available by a manufacturer or vendor as one unit.<br>
[0036]    The above embodiments of the present disclosure are illustrative and not limitative. The disclosure is not limited by the type or manufacturer of the GPS receiver, CDMA base station tester or the time/frequency counter. The disclosure is not limited to any specific clock frequency or any interface used for communication between various equipment. The disclosure is not limited by the kind of software/hardware module used to input parameters related to calibration. Other additions, subtractions, deletions, and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure as set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
HIGH ACCURACY SYNCHRONIZATION OF TEST EQUIPMENT<br>
To determine the delay between true GPS time and the arrival time of a CDMA signal, a GPS receiver generates a first reference signal that is locked to true GPS time, and applies this signal to a CDMA base station test equipment. The CDMA base station test equipment receives the CDMA signal and generates a second reference signal which has transitions occurring substantially concurrently with transitions of an internal synchronization clock used to sample the first reference signal. The CDMA base station test equipment provides the delay between the second reference signal and the CDMA signal. A frequency/time counter provides the delay between the first reference signal and the second reference signal. The sum of the delays supplied by the CDMA base station test equipment and the frequency/time counter represents the delay between true GPS time and the CDMA signal.<br>
