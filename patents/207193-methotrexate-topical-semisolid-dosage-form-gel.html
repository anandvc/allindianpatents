THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
14 OCT 2005<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to formulation of Methotrexate.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to the production of a topical gel.<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Methotrexate   is   an   antimetabolite   used   in   the   treatment   of   certain neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis, and adult rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Chemically   Methotrexate   is   N-   [4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)   methyl] methylamino] benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid.<br>
Molecular weight: 454.45 C20H22N8O5 and the structural formula is:<br><br>
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and an analogue of folic acid. It enters the cells via an active transport system for reduced folates and, due to a relatively irreversible binding, exerts its cytotoxic effect by competitively inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase which catalyses the conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate. This interferes with the synthesis of thymidylic acid and purines, which in turn inhibits DNA synthesis and cell reproduction, and to a lesser extent protein and RNA synthesis.<br>
The affinity of dihydrofolate reductase for Methotrexate is far greater than its affinity for folic or dihydrofolic acid and, therefore, even very large<br>
2<br><br>
amounts of folic acid given simultaneously will not reverse the effects of Methotrexate. Methotrexate seems also to cause an increase in intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate, which is thought to inhibit ribonucleotide reduction and polynucleotide ligase, an enzyme concerned in DNA synthesis and repair.<br>
Methotrexate acts specifically on the S-phase of the cell cycle. Tissues with a high cellular proliferation rate such as neoplastic tissue, bone marrow, epithelial cells or foetal cells seem to be the most susceptible. Methotrexate is used for this reason in the treatment of psoriasis, where the rate of production of epithelial cells of the skin is much higher than that of normal cells.<br>
Methotrexate may be of value in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis, which is not adequately responsive to other forms of treatment. However, due to the high risk associated with its use, Methotrexate should be used after the diagnosis has been definitely established, as by biopsy and/or after dermatologic consultation.<br>
The patient should be fully informed of the risks involved and should be under constant supervision of the physician.<br>
Assessment of renal function, liver function and blood elements should be made by history, physical examination and laboratory tests (such as haemogram, urinalysis, serum creatinine, liver function studies and liver biopsy if indicated) before beginning Methotrexate, periodically during Methotrexate therapy and before reinstituting Methotrexate therapy after a rest period. Appropriate steps should be taken to avoid conception for at least 12 weeks following Methotrexate therapy.<br>
All schedules should be continually tailored to the individual patient. A single test dose of 5 to 10 mg parenterally one week prior to initiation of therapy is recommended to detect any idiosyncratic reaction.<br>
Contraindications:<br>
Known hypersensitivity to Methotrexate and severe renal impairment are contraindications.<br>
3<br><br>
In the treatment of psoriasis, Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients with poor nutritional status, severe hepatic disorders or in those with pre-existing blood dyscrasias (such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia or anaemia).<br>
The presence of liver impairment, alcoholism, serious infections, peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis warrant extreme caution in using Methotrexate for antineoplastic therapy while they represent contraindications for its use in patients with psoriasis.<br>
Methotrexate is also contraindicated in patients with recent exposure to, recent or existing chicken pox or Herpes Zoster, and in patients with immunodeficiency.<br>
Radiotherapy to the central nervous system should not be given concurrently with intrathecal Methotrexate.<br>
SIDE EFFECTS WITH METHOTREXATE<br>
The    most   frequently    reported    adverse    reactions    include    ulcerative<br>
stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently<br>
reported  adverse  effects  are  malaise,   undue  fatigue,  chills  and  fever,<br>
dizziness and decreased resistance to infection.<br>
Other adverse reactions that have been reported with Methotrexate are<br>
listed   below   by   organ   system.   In   the   oncology   setting,   concomitant<br>
treatment and the underlying disease make specific attribution of a reaction<br>
to Methotrexate difficult.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methotrexate based medicaments have been known in the art for years, and have been shown to possess anti-neoplastic, anti-angiogenic, anti-fibroblastic, and/or immunosuppressive activities. While administering methotrexate based medicaments have been identified as a promising remedy to treat many of the above-identified irregularities, delivering methotrexate based medicaments to an affected area of a living subject has remained heretofore largely problematic. Indeed, known prior art methods of administering methotrexate based medicaments, identified hereinbelow,<br>
4<br><br>
are replete with substantial drawbacks and/or life threatening complications.<br>
For example, delivering methotrexate based medicaments to an affected, local area of a living subject using a systemic delivery method is problematic because of the many severe, sometimes life threatening, side effects associated with systemic delivery of methotrexate based medicaments, such as, for examples, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, leukopenia (bone marrow suppression), mucositis, ulcerative stomatitis, skin rash, nausea, abdominal distress, malaise, fatigue, chills and fever, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulceration or perforation, pancreatitis, pericarditis, hypotension, deep venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, interstitial pneumonitis, headaches, drowsiness, cognitive dysfunction, reduced immunity, rash, photosensitivity, nephropathy, hematuria, alopecia, defective oogenesis, oligospermia, infertility, miscarriage, and birth defects.<br>
US Application 20050208137 provides compositions comprising an anti-angiogenic factor, and a polymeric carrier. Representative examples of anti-angiogenic factors include Anti-Invasive Factor, Methotrexate, Retinoic acids and derivatives thereof, and taxol. Also provided are methods for embolizing blood vessels, and eliminating biliary, urethral, esophageal, and tracheal/bronchial obstructions. This formulation is not suitable for topical applications.<br>
United States Application 20050153969 shows a method for treating neoplastic, angiogenic, fibroblastic, and/or immunosuppressive ocular irregularities of a living subject, comprising the steps of: providing a living subject, wherein the living subject includes an affected ocular area having a neoplastic, angiogenic, fibroblastic, and/or immunosuppressive irregularity; providing a methotrexate based medicament, wherein the methotrexate based medicament is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis; associating a therapeutically effective concentration of the methotrexate based medicament with the affected ocular area of the living subject; and decreasing       the       neoplastic,       angiogenic,       fibroblastic,       and/or<br>
5<br><br>
immunosuppressive ocular irregularity of the living subject. This formulation does not suggest Methotrexate topical application.<br>
United States Patent 6485740 discloses a methotrexate-containing transdermal preparation effective for rheumatoid arthritis comprises an organic amine. The organic amine may preferably be an alkonolamine such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine or diisopropanolamine, or an alkylamine such as ethylamine, diethylamine or triethylamine. The transdermal preparation is, for example, a plaster, a cataplasm, an ointment, a cream or a lotion. The base of this product is non aqueous but an oil based formulation containing an organic amine.<br>

16<br><br>
and/or sole areas involved) were included in the study. The age groups of these patients are in between 21 to 74 years. Topical Methotrexate 0.25% gel was applied twice daily to the lesions for twelve weeks. The drug was well tolerated by all patients. Methotrexate 0.25% gel effectively controls psoriasis in the 75 % cases; remaining patients show improvement in the infection after thrice daily applications for 8 week of treatment.<br>
These study suggested that the topical gel of this present invention formulation is an effective alternative to the oral or perenteral therapy for skin cancers and psoriasis. Secondly there is a need for this as it was studied that in the systemic therapy of Methotrexate shows many severe side effects which otherwise avoided by direct applications. _  _   _<br>
