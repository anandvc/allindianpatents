Rotary Compressive Molding Machine for Powder Material<br>
FIELD OF THE ART<br>
This invention relates to a rotary compressive molding machine for powder material that compresses powder material in order to mold a tablet or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, in case medical tablets are manufactured by the use of this kind of rotary compressive molding machine if raw powder material of a medical tablet is made of a medicine formulation ingredient alone, a sticking phenomenon such that the raw powder material or the medical tablet sticks into a punch or a die might occur. In order to prevent this kind of problem, a method for tableting the powder material wherein powder lubricant such as magnesium stearate or the like is mixed into the raw powder material has been generally used.<br>
Senile medical field is recently considered to be essential. This increases a demand for tablets which are easy to melt or collapse in a mouth so that elder persons can swallow it without difficulty or for tablets which melt immediately after swallowed so as to produce the efficacy of the medicine. However, in case the medical tablets are manufactured by the above-mentioned conventional method the powder lubricant mixed into the raw powder material hinders collapsing or melting in a mouth, which makes it difficult<br><br>
2<br>
to meet the above-mentioned demand. In addition, due to a mixture of the powder lubricant, the tablets become fragile.<br>
In view of the situation and with an object to prevent a sticking phenomenon considered, there is no need of mixing the powder lubricant with a medicine formulation ingredient. Then it has been examined that the lubricant is sprayed so as to adhere to a part alone where a sticking phenomenon occurs such as a surface of the punches and the tablet can be made of the powder material made of a medicine formulation ingredient alone. In view of the above, it has been conceived that powder lubricant is sprayed to the upper and the lower punches and the die hole prior to compression and molding a tablet.<br>
However, there might be a problem that the powder lubricant is scattered when sprayed or a problem of contamination such that powder lubricant is mixed with a medicine formulation ingredient or a medicine formulation ingredient is mixed into powder lubricant when the lubricant is sprayed, resulting in unevenness of the powder lubricant adhering to the upper and lower punches. In order to prevent the powder lubricant from scattering it has been conceived that the punches are surrounded at a position where the powder lubricant is sprayed. However, this arrangement requires an opening through which the powder lubricant passes for the upper punch, thereby to be unable to suppress      scattering the powder lubricant effectively.<br>
In addition, since the powder lubricant is applied to the tip of the punch and the die hole, the quantity of the<br><br>
3 <br>
powder lubricant is very subtle. However, it was difficult to measure the subtle quantity of the powder lubricant to spray the powder lubricant. For example, in a case of a storing tank in which the powder lubricant can be stored and whose bottom face is formed with an elastic membrane plate member so as to take out a subtle quantity of the powder lubricant through the bottom face thereof, wherein a small-diameter hole is provided on the membrane plate member and the membrane plate member is vibrated by a pulse air vibration wave, a quantity of the powder lubricant measured in the small-diameter hole varies according to a pulse of the pulse air vibration wave and a transformation degree of the membrane plate member, which makes it difficult to measure the quantity with accuracy. As a result of this, if a quantity of the powder lubricant is measured something over, a superfluous powder lubricant that is not applied to the tip of the punch or the die hole scatters inside the rotary compressive molding machine for powder material, resulting in growing a problem of contamination. The present invention intends to solve all of the above problems.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to attain the object the present invention has the following arrangement. More specifically, a rotary compressive molding machine for powder material in accordance with the present invention has an arrangement in which a powder lubricant supplying means comprises a powder lubricant, supplying portion that stores powder lubricant and sends out a predetermined quantity of powder lubricant continuously, a flow quantity detecting portion that<br><br>
4 <br>
detects a flow quantity of the powder lubricant, a retrieved quantity detecting portion that detects superfluous powder lubricant that does not attach to either a tip of a punch or a die hole and a control portion that controls the powder-lubricant supplying portion by computing the necessary quantity of the powder lubricant based on the quantity detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the retrieved quantity detecting portion respectively in order to measure a subtle quantity of the powder lubricant with accuracy.<br>
The present invention provides a rotary compressive molding machine for powder material wherein a rotary table is rotatably arranged in a frame through an upright shaft, a die having a die hole is arranged on the rotary table, an upper punch and a lower punch are kept above and below the. die In a vertically slidable condition and powder material filled in the die hole is compressed and molded between a lower face of the upper punch and an upper face of the lower punch by pushing the upper punch and the lower punch so as to approach each other with their tip inserted into the die hole, comprising a powder lubricant supplying means that supplies the upper face of the lower punch, the lower face of the upper punch and the die hole with a predetermined quantity of powder lubricant prior to filling the powder material, and characterized by that the powder lubricant<br><br>
5<br>
supplying means comprises a powder lubricant supplying portion that stores powder lubricant and sends out the stored powder lubricant at a required quantity continuously, a flow quantity detecting portion that detects a flow quantity of the powder lubricant sent out from the powder lubricant supplying portion, a retrieved quantity detecting portion that detects a quantity of superfluous powder lubricant other than the powder lubricant actually used while the powder material is compressed and molded based on the quantity detected by the flow quantity detecting portion, and a control portion that computes a quantity of the powder lubricant to send out based on a quantity detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the retrieved quantity detecting portion respectively and controls the powder lubricant supplying portion so as to send out the powder lubricant at a computed quantity.<br>
In accordance with the arrangement, the powder lubricant supplying portion continuously sends out stored powder lubricant at a predetermined quantity. The flow quantity detecting portion detects a quantity of the powder lubricant sent out from the powder lubricant supplying portion and outputs the detected quantity to the control portion. The retrieved quantity detecting portion detects a quantity of superfluous powder lubricant other than the powder lubricant actually used and outputs the detected quantity (retrieved quantity) into the control portion. The control portion computes a quantity of the powder lubricant to send out based on the input quantity detected by the flow<br><br>
6 <br>
quantity   detecting   portion   and   the   retrieved   quantity   detecting   portion respectively and controls the powder lubricant supplying portion so as to send out the powder lubricant at a computed quantity.<br>
As a result of this, it is possible to control a quantity of the powder lubricant that is actually required to spray based on the quantity of the powder lubricant that is actually sent out and the quantity of the powder lubricant that is retrieved, which makes it possible to control the quantity of the powder lubricant to be sprayed with high accuracy.  Therefore, the powder lubricant can be used effectively, thereby to minimize a quantity of the powder lubricant to be used. In addition, since a quantity of the superfluous powder lubricant can be reduced, it; is possible to minimise mixture of the powder lubricant into a powder material to be compressed and molded and also it is possible to prevent a problem such as a case in which  powder lubricant attaches to the die or the rotary table unnecessarily and becomes lumpy and then drops when a lump of the powder-lubricant grows to a certain size. The lump of the powder lubricant might drop on. the rotary table and crash into pieces and the powder lubricant is mixed into the powder material. With this arrangement, a case like the above can be prevented from occurring.<br>
It is  preferable that the flow quantity detecting  portion comprises a. light transparent detecting pipe inside of which the powder lubricant flows, a light source that irradiates light on the powder lubricant that flows inside<br><br>
7<br>
the detecting pipe and a light detector that detects scattered light that is scattered by the powder lubricant inside the detecting pipe and that the flow quantity of the powder lubricant flowing inside the flow quantity detecting portion is detected by means of scattered luminous intensity. As mentioned, since the flow quantity detecting portion makes use of the intensity of the scattered light scattered by the powder lubricant flowing inside the detecting pipe, it is possible to detect a subtle quantity of the flowing powder lubricant.<br>
It is preferable that the powder lubricant supplying means further comprises a powder sucking mechanism that introduces the superfluous powder lubricant into the retrieved quantity detecting portion. As mentioned, with the powder sucking mechanism provided, it is possible to detect the flow quantity of the powder lubricant by making use of the above light or electrical capacitance, thereby to improve an accuracy of detecting a retrieved quantity. Therefore, it is possible to accurately detect a quantity that is actually used based on the supplied quantity of the powder lubricant detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the retrieved quantity of the powder lubricant, which makes it possible to control the supplying quantity of the powder lubricant with accuracy.<br>
The flow quantity detecting portion is represented by that comprising an electrode for measurement that detects electrical capacitance of the powder lubricant flowing inside the detecting pipe and that the flow quantity of the<br><br>
8 <br>
powder lubricant is detected based on a variation of the electrical capacitance detected by the electrode for measurement.<br>

The device LS for supplying and spraying powder lubricant constituting a powder lubricant supplying means comprises, as shown in Fig. 9, a powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 that sends out the powder lubricant L that attaches to an outer face of a rotary drum D driven by a  motor M by means of an air flow, a flow quantity detecting portion LS2 that detects a flow quantity of the powder lubricant L sent out from  the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1, a retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 that<br><br>
16<br>
detects a retrieved quantity of the powder lubricant L that is sprayed from the upper and the lower nozzles NU, NB and that does not attach to either the upper punch 5, the lower punch 6 or the die hole 41, a control portion LS4 that controls the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 based on a quantity of the powder lubricant L detected by the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 and the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 and a dust pick-upper LS5 constituting the powder sucking mechanism. The powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 is arranged outside of the rotary compressive molding machine for powder material, while the flow quantity detecting portion LS2, the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3, the control portion LS4. and the dust pick-upper LS5 are arranged in the rotary compressive molding machine for powder material.<br>
The powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 is so arranged that powder lubricant L is filled into a groove provided on the outer face of the rotary drum D and the powder lubricant L filled in the groove is pushed in a pressurized condition into a tubule by means of pressurized air so as to be sent out to the flow quantity detecting portion LS2. The groove serves a function as a measuring portion of the powder lubricant L and controls a delivery quantity rate per unit of time, in other word, a quantity of a flow rate per unit of time by sending the powder lubricant L by means of a predetermined pressurized air. Superfluous powder lubricant L is removed from the outer face of the rotary drum D by a smoothing plate so that the powder<br><br>
17<br>
lubricant L is not excessively filled and the superfluous powder lubricant L which attaches near the groove does not enter the tubule as well. In accordance with the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1, a quantity of the powder lubricant L that is sent out is, for example, 5 through 25 gm per hour. The quantity of the powder lubricant L is detected by the flow quantity detecting portion LS2, a difference between the detected quantity and a quantity detected by the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 is calculated by the control portion LS4 and a flow quantity of the powder lubricant L is feedback controlled so as to be a predetermined quantity based on the calculated result.<br>
The flow quantity detecting portion LS2 comprises, as shown in Fig. 10, a flow cell LS2a as a light transparent detecting pipe inside of which the powder lubricant L flows, a laser pointer (hereinafter called a laser) that consists of a light visible semiconductor laser as a light source that irradiates light on the powder lubricant L flowing in the flow cell LS2a, a photo cell LS2c as a light detector that detects scattered light scattering from the powder lubricant L in the flow cell LS2a, a circular slit LS2d through which laser light irradiated from the laser LS2b passes, a toric slit LS2e through which the scattered light transmitted from the flow cell LS2a passes, a relay lens LS2f that gathers rays of laser light passing through the toric slit LS2e and a second photo cell LS2k that measures intensity of the laser light transmitted from the flow cell LS2a in order to adjust luminescence intensity through a<br><br>
18<br>
reflecting mirror LS2g, LS2g and a filter LS2h. More specifically, the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 of this embodiment employs a method of a low angle light diffusion and detects the scattered light by means of the photo cell LS2c.<br>
A signal output from the photo cell LS2c of the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 is input into the control portion LS4 and then a flow quantity of the powder lubricant L is calculated by the control portion LS4. More specifically, the control portion LS4 integrates the signal output from the photo cell LS2c with respect to each of a predetermined period, for example, 3-5 seconds. A cross-sectional area of the powder lubricant L flowing in the flow cell LS2a is detected by integrating the signal output from the photo cell LS2c- The control portion LS4 computes a mean value of the integrated value and calculates a flow quantity of the powder lubricant L based on the mean value of the integrated value. Intensity of the signal output from the photo cell LS2c is generally in proportion with a quantity of the powder lubricant L flowing in the flow cell LS2a and the higher an intensity of a signal is, the more the quantity of the powder lubricant L flows.<br>
The retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 is to measure a superfluous quantity of the powder lubricant L absorbed by the dust pick-upper LS5 and has the same  arrangement as that of the flow quantity detecting portion LS2.<br>
The control portion LS4 comprises a micro computer as<br><br>

a chief constituting element, an A/D converter that converts each of output signals from the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 and the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 and an electrical control unit having a memory that stores a measured result or a computed result or the like. The control portion LS4 measures each flow quantities of the powder lubricant L to be supplied and the powder lubricant L to be retrieved by the dust pick-upper LS5 based on the signal output from the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 and the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3, computes a required flow quantity of the powder lubricant L based on the measured flow quantity and controls the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 based on the calculated result. More specifically, a quantity, namely a consumed quantity Q1, of the powder lubricant L that is adhered to the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5, the upper face 6a of the lower punch 6 and the inner face of the die hole 41 is an amount that is subtracted a flow quantity, namely a retrieved quantity Q2, of the powder lubricant L measured based on the signal output from the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3 from a flow quantity, namely a supplied quantity Q, of the powder lubricant L that is measured based on the signal output from the flow quantity detecting portion LS2. In case the computed consumed quantity Ql exceeds a predetermined target consumed quantity Qt, the control portion LS4 controls the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 so as to lessen a supplying quantity sent from the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1. On the contrary, in case the computed<br><br>
20<br>
 consumed quantity Q1 is less than the predetermined target consumed quantity Qt. the control portion LS4 controls the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 so as to increase the supplying quantity.<br>
In accordance with the arrangement, the powder lubricant L is sprayed at<br>
a timing that will be explained hereinafter. The timing of spraying the powder lubricant L will be explained with reference to Fig. 3 sprinkled with a process to mold a tablet PL. Each of TO - T5 in Fig. 3 means a phase. The upper and the lower punches 5, 6 are kept at the highest position in a step when passing the unloading portion 10 (TO). Next, the upper and the lower punches 5, 6 move to the lubricant spraying portion K by a rotation of the rotary table 3 with the position of the upper and the lower punches 5, 6 kept at the highest position (T1). At this position, the powder lubricant L is sprayed to the upper punch 5. Next, when the rotary table 3 rotates, the lower punch 6 is lowered by an amount' corresponding to a thickness of the tablet PL at a front end portion of the lowering device 71. At this position, the powder lubricant L is sprayed to the lower punch 6 and the die 4 (T2). As a result of this, the powder lubricant L can adhere to the upper face 6a of the lower punch 6 and the inner face of the die<br>
hole 41 by a depth corresponding to the thickness of the tablet PL.<br>
As mentioned above, since the powder lubricant L is sprayed from the upper nozzle NU when the upper punch 5 is kept     at    the     highest      position,     the     sprayed     powder   lubricant    L<br><br>
21<br>
intensively adheres to the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5. Then since the lower punch 6 paired with the upper punch<br>
5	and the die 4 pass below the lower nozzle NB with the<br>
above-mentioned position kept, the powder lubricant L<br>
sprayed from the lower nozzle NB  adheres to the lower punch<br>
6	and the inner face of the die hole 41. Since the powder<br>
lubricant L is guided by the concave face NUa of the upper<br>
nozzle NU and the concave face NBa of the lower nozzle NB<br>
and sprayed, the powder lubricant L diffuses in a generally<br>
even state toward the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5,<br>
the upper face 6a of the lower punch 6 and the inner face of<br>
the die hole 41. More specifically, since the concave face<br>
NUa, NBa is a three dimensional curved surface, in case the<br>
powder lubricant L is sprayed from the introducing hole NUc,<br>
NBc and collides against the concave face NUa, NBa, the<br>
powder lubricant L travels along the concave face NUa, NBa<br>
in a direction of spraying the powder lubricant L from the<br>
introducing hole NUc, NBc and a direction that crosses the<br>
above direction. In a case of the upper nozzle NU, since the<br>
concave face NUa faces to the through hole Kl locating Just<br>
above the concave face NUa, the powder lubricant L passes<br>
through the hole Kl and reaches the lower face 5a of the<br>
upper punch 5. In a case of the lower nozzle NB, the powder<br>
lubricant L is guided by the concave face NBa and reaches<br>
directly the upper face 6a of the lower punch 6 and the<br>
 inner face of the die hole 41. As a result of this, the powder lubricant L adheres evenly to general whole area of the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5, the upper face 6a of<br><br>
22<br>
the lower punch 6 and the inner face of the die hole 41 by a predetermined depth. In this case, since the air curtain AC exists above the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5, the powder lubricant L that does not attach the lower face 5a of the upper punch 5 reaches an inlet along the air flow of the air curtain AC and is retrieved from the pipe P by the dust pick-upper LS5 through the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3. For a case of the lower nozzle NB, since the concave face NBa faces downward, the superfluous powder lubricant L that is bounced against the upper face 6a of the lower punch 6 and the rotary table 3 flows into the pipe P along the first upper wall BX2 and the powder lubricant L that flows out of the through hole K1 flows into the pipe P through an inlet K2 by the air flow of the air curtain AC like the case of the upper nozzle NU.<br>
Next, when the lower punch 6 moves to the filling portion 7 due to a rotation of the rotary table 3, the lower punch 6 is first lowered to a middle position under the guidance of a front half of the lowering device 71 and  then to a further lower position under the guidance of a rear half thereof (T3). On its way the powder material supplied on the rotary table 3 by the powder material supplying mechanism 73 is evenly introduced by making use of guidance by the feed shoe 72. Then the lower punch 6 runs up onto a quantity setting rail 82, which raises the lower punch 6 until it reaches a predetermined height and a predetermined quantity of powder material is filled into the die 4. The powder material which has overflowed from the die 4 is<br><br>
23<br>
 leveled when it passes through the leveling plate 8 and gathered toward the center of the rotary table 3. During this process, the upper punch 5 is kept at the highest position by a guide rail 102.<br><br>
Next, the upper punch 5 is lowered (T4) under the guidance of the upper punch lowering cam 91 so as to insert the tip thereof into the die 4. Then the powder material in the die 4 is compressed and molded into the tablet PL by the upper and lower punches 5, 6 which pass between the upper and lower preliminary compressive rollers 92, 93 and the upper and lower compressive rollers 94, 95 (T5).<br>
After the tablet PL is molded, the upper punch 5 is raised under the<br>
guidance of the upper punch raising cam 100 so as to be withdrawn out of the<br>
die 4, and then the tablet PL in the die 4 is pushed upward so as to come out on<br>
the rotary table 3 by the lower punch 6 pushed by the pushing up rail 106.  The<br>
tablet PL is guided onto a chute 104 by the guide plate 105 and introduced out of<br>
the rotary compressive molding machine for powder material. Next, the upper<br>
punch 5 is further raised under the guidance of the upper punch raising cam 100. As mentioned above, the rotary compressive molding machine for powder<br>
material can produce a predetermined tablet PL repeatedly and successively<br>
with the powder material compressed and molded.<br>
In accordance with thus arranged rotary compressive molding machine for<br>
powder material of this embodiment, since a quantity of the powder lubricant  L<br>
sent out from the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 and a quantity of the<br><br>
24<br>
superfluous powder lubricant L retrieved by the dust pick-upper LS5 are detected and a quantity of the powder lubricant L to be sent by the powder lubricant supplying portion LS1 is controlled so as to be an actually required quantity based on the detected quantities, the quantity of the powder lubricant L sent out from the power lubricant supplying portion LS1 can be adjusted in a subtle manner, the quantity of the powder lubricant L to be sprayed can be optimally adjusted and wasteful consumption of the powder lubricant L can be minimized. In addition, since the powder lubricant L is sprayed at a minimum required quantity, contamination of the powder material to be molded can be inhibited to a lower level in a cy pres manner. Further, since the quantity of the flow is detected by means of the scattered light in the flow quantity detecting portion LS2 and the retrieved quantity detecting portion LS3, the quantity of the flow can be detected continuously. In addition, since the quantity of the flow can be detected in a closed space of the flow cell LS2a, the powder lubricant L can be prevented from scattering all over the area, thereby to maintain a predetermined detecting accuracy for a long term.<br>
Furthermore since a quantity of the superfluous powder lubricant L can be reduced, the air curtain AC can prevent the sprayed powder lubricant L from scattering upward and the superfluous powder lubricant L that scatters outside or inside the box body BX can be retrieved, it is possible to prevent a problem such as a case in which the powder<br><br>
25<br>
lubricant L attaches to the upper die 5 or the rotary table 3 unnecessarily and to be lumpy and then drops when a lump of the powder lubricant L grows to a certain size and also possible to prevent in advance from occurring a case in which the lump of the powder lubricant L drops on the rotary-table 3 and crashes into pieces and the powder lubricant L is mixed into the powder material to be molded into the tablet PL.<br>
In addition, since the powder lubricant L is guided by<br>
the concave face NUa of the upper nozzle NU and the concave<br>
face NBa of the lower nozzle NB and sprayed to a portion<br>
that contacts with the powder material, namely, the lower<br>
face 5a of the upper punch 5, the upper face 6a of the lower<br>
punch 6 and the inner face 41 of the die 4 every time prior<br>
to compression of the powder material, the powder lubricant<br>
L attaches to the portion in a generally uniform condition<br>
and a sticking phenomenon can be prevented securely. In<br>
addition, since the sprayed powder lubricant L is in a small<br>
quantity and minimum required in order to prevent a sticking<br>
phenomenon, a problem that the powder material resides in<br>
the upper punch 5, the lower punch 6 or the die hole 41<br>
because of the powder lubricant L can be prevented. As a<br>
result of this, it is possible to manufacture a tablet PL<br>
that has enough hardness with a powder material in which the<br>
powder lubricant L is not mixed.<br>
	Further, the air curtain AC and the bellow 5n are<br>
arranged near a bottom end of the upper punch 5 when the upper punch 5 locates at the powder lubricant spraying<br><br>
26<br>
portion K, it is possible to prevent the powder lubricant L that leaks from the box body BX of the powder lubricant spraying portion K from unnecessarily attaching to the upper punch 5. In addition, since the powder lubricant L is sprayed at a small quantity near the end face of the upper punch 5 and the lower punch 6 and the superfluous powder lubricant L is retrieved by making use of the air flow of the air curtain AC, it is possible to prevent the superfluous powder lubricant L from scattering certainly.<br>
This invention is not limited to the above-explained embodiments.<br>
For example, the flow quantity detecting portion may comprise an electrode for measurement that detects electrical capacitance of the powder lubricant flowing inside the detecting pipe and the flow quantity of the powder lubricant is detected based on a variation of the electrical capacitance detected by the electrode for measurement. In this case, a reference electrode is provided to give a relative voltage corresponding to an environment so as to set off an effect on the electrical capacitance that is detected by the electrode for measurement- As mentioned above, if the reference electrode is provided, it is possible to lessen an effect on the electrical capacitance detected with a variation of the environment, more specifically a variation of temperature or humidity of ambulances, thereby to improve the accuracy of detection. In addition, like the above embodiment, since the quantity of the powder lubricant L can be detected while the powder<br><br>
27<br>
 lubricant L is flowing, time required for detection can be cut down, thereby to speed up detection.<br>
The other arrangement of the component is not limited to the embodiment described in the drawings and there may be various modifications without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRY<br>
As mentioned above, in accordance with the present invention, since the flow quantity detecting portion detects a flow quantity of the powder lubricant sent out from the powder lubricant supplying portion and the control portion computes a quantity of the powder lubricant to be sent out based on the quantity detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the superfluous quantity detected by the retrieved quantity detecting portion and controls the powder lubricant supplying portion, it is possible to control the quantity of the powder lubricant so as to be an actually required quantity based on the quantity detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the superfluous quantity detected by the retrieved quantity detecting portion. As a result of this, it is possible to spray the powder lubricant by controlling the quantity of the powder lubricant with high accuracy, thereby to improve effectiveness of using the powder lubricant. This makes it possible to cut a quantity of the powder lubricant to the minimum and improve an economical efficiency.<br>
In        addition,        since       a        quantity       of       the     superfluous<br><br>
28<br>
powder lubricant can be reduced, it is possible to suppress mixture of the powder lubricant into a powder material to be compressed and molded in a cy-press manner and also possible to prevent a problem such as a case in which powder lubricant attaches to the die or the rotary table unnecessarily and to be lumpy so as to drop when a lump of the powder lubricant grows to a certain size. The lump of the powder lubricant might drop on the rotary table and crash into pieces and the powder lubricant is mixed into the powder material. With this arrangement, a case like the above can be prevented from occurring.<br>
If the flow quantity detecting portion comprises a light transparent detecting pipe inside of which the powder lubricant flows, a light source that irradiates light on the powder lubricant that flows inside the detecting pipe and a light detector that detects scattered light that is scattered by the powder lubricant inside the detecting pipe and the flow quantity of the powder lubricant flowing inside the detecting pipe is detected by means of scattered luminous intensity, the flow quantity detecting portion makes use of the intensity of the scattered light scattered by the powder lubricant flowing inside the detecting pipe, which makes it possible to detect a subtle quantity of the flowing powder lubricant with high speed and high accuracy.<br>
If the powder lubricant supplying means further  comprises a powder sucking mechanism that introduces the superfluous powder lubricant into the retrieved quantity detecting portion, with the powder sucking mechanism<br><br>
provided, it is possible to detect the flow quantity of the powder lubricant by making use of the above light or electrical capacitance, thereby to improve an accuracy of detecting a retrieved quantity. Therefore, it is possible to detect a quantity that is actually used accurately based on the supplied quantity of the powder lubricant detected by the flow quantity detecting portion and the retrieved quantity of the powder lubricant, which makes it possible to control the supplying quantity of the powder lubricant with accuracy.<br><br><br>
