[Invention Title]<br>
LATCH ASSEMBLY FOR VEHICLE SEAT<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a latch assembly for a vehicle<br>
seat, and more particularly, to a latch assembly mounted to a vehicle<br>
seat to assemble and disassemble the vehicle seat to a chassis.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A latch assembly for a vehicle seat is an apparatus for assembling<br>
and disassembling a vehicle seat to a chassis.<br>
It is necessary that the latch assembly for the vehicle seat<br>
has convenience of an operation, and a smooth working under various<br>
coupling conditions. Especially, although an impact is applied to<br>
a chassis when the seat is coupled to the chassis, it is necessary<br>
that a coupling state thereof is certainly maintained.<br>
To satisfy the above requirement, a lot of technologies have<br>
been developed, and a latch assembly for a vehicle seat having a base<br>
plate, a latch rotatably coupled to the base plate and a pawl<br>
interacting with the latch has been disclosed and released.<br>
However, there is still a demand for an improved latch assembly<br>
for a vehicle seat.<br><br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a latch<br>
assembly for a vehicle seat having an improved configuration which<br>
enables a convenient handling and is capable of smoothly operating<br>
although there is a coupling condition error, and stably maintaining<br>
a coupling state in spite of an external impact against a chassis.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
The foregoing and/or other aspects of the present invention can<br>
be achieved by providing a latch assembly for a vehicle seat which<br>
comprises a base plate, a latch which is rotatably coupled to the<br>
base plate to rotate between a locking position and an open position,<br>
and a pawl and a pawl plate which are coaxial with the base plate<br>
and coupled to be overlapped each other to interact with each other<br>
to rotate, the latch assembly for the vehicle seat comprising: the<br>
latch comprising a locking surface; the pawl plate comprising a<br>
pressing surface which presses the locking surface when the latch<br>
is positioned at the locking position, and a first supporting surface<br>
which supports the locking surface when the latch rotates by means<br>
of an impact; and the pawl comprising a second supporting surface<br>
which supports the locking surface together with the pawl plate when<br><br>
the latch rotates by means of the impact.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the pressing<br>
surface forms a part of a circular arc which comprises a rotation<br>
center which is distanced from a rotation shaft of the pawl plate<br>
to contact to the locking surface to form a predetermined pressing<br>
angle when the latch is positioned at the locking position, and the<br>
first supporting surface extends from a first side of the pressing<br>
surface, and forms a part of a circular arc, the center of which is<br>
the rotation shaft of the pawl plate.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the pawl plate<br>
further comprises an engagement end unit which protrudes from a second<br>
side of the pressing surface in a radius direction to prevent the<br>
pawl plate from additionally rotating when the latch is positioned<br>
at the locking position.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the latch<br>
comprises a lower latch which interacts with the pawl, and an upper<br>
latch which is integrally overlapped over the lower latch to interact<br>
with the pawl plate, the locking surface comprises a lower locking<br>
surface which is formed to the lower latch, and an upper locking<br>
surface which is formed to the upper latch, and the first supporting<br>
surface supports the upper locking surface, and the second supporting<br>
surface supports the lower locking surface when the latch rotates<br><br>
by means of the impact.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the lower<br>
locking surface and the upper locking surface are formed to correspond<br>
to each other.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the upper latch<br>
is formed with an accommodating space unit which accommodates an end<br>
part of the second supporting surface of the pawl plate when the latch<br>
is positioned at the locking position.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the latch<br>
comprises a blocking surface, and the first supporting surface and<br>
the second supporting surface support the blocking surface when the<br>
latch is positioned at the open position.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the latch<br>
comprises a lower latch which interacts with the pawl, and an upper<br>
latch which is integrally overlapped over the lower latch to interact<br>
with the pawl plate, the blocking surface comprises a lower blocking<br>
surface which is formed to the lower latch, and an upper blocking<br>
surface which is formed to the upper latch, and the first supporting<br>
surface supports the upper blocking surface, and the second supporting<br>
surface supports the lower blocking surface when the latch is<br>
positioned at the open position.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the latch is<br><br>
formed with a pressing end unit which presses an end part of the firs<br>
supporting surface to rotate the pawl pate by a predetermined angle<br>
while rotating from the open position to the locking position.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the pawl plate<br>
is restricted by means of the pawl to have a restricted rotation range.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the pawl<br>
comprises a guide protrusion which is distanced from a rotation shaft<br>
thereof to protrude, and the pawl plate comprises a slide groove which<br>
accommodates the guide protrusion, and guides the guide protrusion<br>
to rotate in a circumferential direction by a predetermined interval.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the pawl and<br>
the pawl plate are elastically pressed to respectively and<br>
independently rotate toward the latch.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the base plate<br>
comprises a depressed groove unit which has a wide width, and<br>
accommodates a locking pin which is coupled to a chassis, the latch<br>
comprises a latch groove unit which accommodates the locking pin<br>
together with the depressed groove unit, and the locking position<br>
of the latch varies depending on the thickness of the locking pin<br>
or a position in which the locking pin is accommodated inside the<br>
depressed groove unit.<br><br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
According to the latch assembly for the vehicle seat according<br>
to the present invention, the latch assembly can be smoothly locked<br>
and released to and from the locking pin provided to the chassis<br>
through the interaction between the latch, the pawl and the pawl plate,<br>
and especially, the pawl and pawl plate support the latch together<br>
to certainly maintain the locking state of the latch assembly when<br>
an impact is applied to the latch at the locking position.<br>
Also, according to the latch assembly for the vehicle seat<br>
according to the present invention, the pressing surface of the pawl<br>
plate forms a circular arc having a rotation center distanced from<br>
the rotation shaft of the pawl plate to form a pressing angle in<br>
contacting to the locking surface, thereby appropriately coping with<br>
a small impulse transmitted from the latch without rotation of the<br>
pawl plate.<br>
Also, according to the latch assembly for the vehicle seat<br>
according to the present invention, the latch is divided into the<br>
lower latch and the upper latch, thereby being freely designed with<br>
respect to the shape of corresponding surfaces respectively<br>
interacting with the pawl and the pawl plate without being restricted<br>
to each other.<br>
Also, the pawl plate has a relatively restricted rotation range<br><br>
with respect to the pawl so that the latch can be guided to be always<br>
simultaneously supported by means of the pawl and the pawl plate when<br>
the latch receives an impact at the locking position, or is positioned<br>
at the open position, thereby improving an operation stability of<br>
the latch assembly.<br>
Also, the base plate forms the depressed groove unit having such<br>
a sufficient width as to accommodate the locking pin of a side of<br>
the chassis so that the locking position of the latch can be variously<br>
determined depending on the position at which the latch groove unit<br>
contacts to and supports the locking pin although there is an error<br>
in the thickness of the locking pin or the position in which the locking<br>
pin is accommodated to the depressed groove unit, thereby preventing<br>
movement and noises by means of the locking pin when the chassis is<br>
vibrated.<br>

[Best Mode]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a latch assembly for a vehicle seat 1 according<br>
to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a base<br>
plate 10, a pawl 20, a pawl plate 30 and a latch 50.<br>
The pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are rotatably coupled to the<br>
base plate 20 by means of a shaft 40. Especially, the pawl 20 and<br>
the pawl plate 30 are overlapped each other so that the pawl 20 can<br>
be positioned to a lower part thereof and the pawl plate 30 can be<br>
positioned to an upper part thereof, and coaxially rotate about the<br>
shaft 40.<br>
Also, the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are respectively formed<br><br>
with a guide protrusion 21 and a slide groove 31.<br>
The guide protrusion 21 is distanced from the shaft in a radius<br>
direction by a predetermined distance to protrude, and the slide<br>
groove 31 is formed through the pawl plate 30 to correspond to the<br>
guide protrusion 21. The guide protrusion 21 is inserted to the slide<br>
groove 31 to rotate in a circumferential direction along the slide<br>
groove 31.<br>
Accordingly, the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are capable of<br>
rotating within a relatively restricted range by means of a coupling<br>
of the guide protrusion 21 and the slide groove 31.<br>
The latch 50 is rotatably coupled to a shaft 60 coupled to a<br>
position distanced rightward from the shaft 40 of the pawl 20 and<br>
the pawl plate 30 on the base plate 10.<br>
Especially, the latch 50 includes a lower latch 51 and an upper<br>
latch 56 overlapped up and down each other, and integrally coupled<br>
by means of pins 50a, 50b and 50c.<br>
When the latch 50 rotates, the lower latch 51 interacts with<br>
the pawl 20, and the upper latch 56 interacts with the pawl plate<br>
30.<br>
The pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are provided to be elastically<br>
and independently pressed toward the latch 50. The pawl 20 is pressed<br>
in an attracting direction toward the latch 50 by means of a tension<br><br>
spring 70, and the pawl plate 30 is supported to the base plate 10<br>
and is pressed to rotate in a clockwise direction by means of a torsion<br>
spring 80.<br>
The pawl plate 30 includes a pressing surface 32 formed to an<br>
external circumference thereof contacting to a locking surface 57<br>
of the latch 50 to support the locking surface 57 in locking.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the latch assembly for the vehicle seat 1<br>
in a locking state. The locking state represents a state in which<br>
a locking pin 2 provided to a chassis of a vehicle is accommodated<br>
to a depressed groove part 10a of the base plate 10 and a latch groove<br>
part 56a of the latch 50 to be restricted. More in detail, in that<br>
state, an upper end of the locking pin 2 is supported to the depressed<br>
groove part 10a, and a lower end thereof is supported to the latch<br>
groove part 56a.<br>
Like this, when the locking pin 2 is accommodated to the depressed<br>
groove part 10a to be locked by means of the latch groove part 56a,<br>
the pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate 30 supports the latch 50,<br>
more in detail, an upper locking surface 57 of the upper latch 56.<br>
Here, locking surfaces 52 and 57 of the latch 50 include a lower<br>
locking surface 52 of a side of the lower latch 51, and the upper<br>
locking surface 57 of a side of the upper latch 56.<br>
The locking surfaces 52 and 57 are formed to correspond to each<br><br>
other, and the lower locking surface 52 interacts with a second<br>
supporting surface 22 of the pawl 20 if an impact is applied to the<br>
latch 50.<br>
The pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate 30 forms a circular<br>
arc, and is formed so that a center 0 thereof is positioned at a<br>
position distanced upward from a center 0 of the shaft 40.<br>
Accordingly, a perpendicular line at a contact point between<br>
the pressing surface 32 and the upper locking surface 57 passes through<br>
the center 0 of the pressing surface 32, and a supporting force F<br>
of the pressing surface 32 supporting the locking surface 57 exists<br>
on this perpendicular line.<br>
That is, a direction of the supporting force F has a predetermined<br>
pressing angle  against the center 0 of the shaft 40. By means of<br>
the pressing angle a although a predetermined impact is transmitted<br>
from the locking surface 57, the pressing surface 32 can be prevented<br>
from immediately rotating in a counterclockwise direction, and absorb<br>
the impact to some degree through the shaft 40.<br>
Here, as the pressing angle  increases, the magnitude of the<br>
supporting force F of the pressing surface 32 decreases. On the other<br>
hand, as the pressing angle a decreases, the magnitude of the<br>
supporting force F increases.<br>
The value of the pressing angle a may be appropriately determined<br><br>
as to prevent a plastic deformation of the pawl plate 30. If a<br>
relatively big impact is applied from the locking surface 57, the<br>
pawl plate 30 rotates in the counterclockwise direction to some extent<br>
so that a first supporting surface 33 of the pawl plate 30 and the<br>
second supporting surface 22 of the pawl 20 can support the locking<br>
surfaces 52 and 57 together (referring to FIG. 12).<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, in the locking state in which the pressing<br>
surface 32 contacts to and supports the upper locking surface 57,<br>
an end part of the second supporting surface 22 of the pawl 20 contacts<br>
and is supported to a round surface 53 of the lower latch 51, and<br>
an end part of the first supporting surface 33 of the pawl plate 30<br>
is partially accommodated to an accommodating space unit 56b which<br>
is recessed from the upper latch 56 to correspond thereto.<br>
That is, the lower latch 51 and the upper latch 56 may be formed<br>
to have various shapes of interactive surfaces thereof as necessary<br>
so that an interactive operation between the pawl 20 and the pawl<br>
plate 30 can be certainly maintained, and a degree of freedom in<br>
respective shape designs can be sufficiently obtained guaranteed.<br>
A rotation center of the round surface 53 having the circular<br>
arc shape corresponds to the center of the shaft 60 to minimize a<br>
contact friction against the end part of the second supporting surface<br>
22, thereby enabling the latch 50 to smoothly rotate.<br><br>
FIGs. 3 to 8 illustrate a locking withdrawing process of the<br>
latch assembly for vehicle seat 1 from the locking state in FIG. 2<br>
in sequence.<br>
In general, if a lever (not shown) coupled to the pawl 20 is<br>
rotated, as shown in FIG. 3, the pawl 20 rotates in the<br>
counterclockwise direction together so that the guide protrusion 21<br>
can contact to an end part of the slide groove 31 of the pawl plate<br>
30, and then, the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 rotate in the<br>
counterclockwise direction together.<br>
The rotation in the counterclockwise direction of the pawl 20<br>
is transmitted to the latch 50 through the tension spring 70 so that<br>
the upper locking surface 57 of the latch 50 can maintain a contact<br>
state against the pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate 30.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 4 and 5, if the pawl 20 and the pawl plate<br>
30 additionally rotate in the counterclockwise direction, the first<br>
supporting surface 33 extending to be adjacent to the pressing surface<br>
32 can contact to the upper locking surface 57 and a pressing end<br>
part 58 adjacent thereto in sequence.<br>
If the first supporting surface 33 passes through the pressing<br>
end part 58 of the latch 50, the pawl 20, the pawl plate 30 and the<br>
latch 50 automatically interact one after another by means of the<br>
springs 70 and 80 although an external force through the lever is<br><br>
removed. That is, a contraction force is generated in the tension<br>
spring by means of an extension, and a restitution force in the<br>
counterclockwise direction is generated in the torsion spring 40 by<br>
means of a rotation compression.<br>
If the external force of the lever is removed in FIG. 5, at first,<br>
the pawl 20 rotates in the clockwise direction to some extent by means<br>
of an attraction force of the tension spring 70 so that the end part<br>
of the second supporting surface 22 can contact and be supported to<br>
the round surface 54 of the lower latch 51 as shown in FIG. 6. Meanwhile,<br>
the end part of the first supporting surface 33 of the pawl plate<br>
30 passes through the pressing end part 58 of the upper plate 56.<br>
The round surface 54 forms a part of a circular arc centering<br>
the shaft 60 to minimize instability of a rotation operation of the<br>
latch 50 due to a contact friction.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 7, the end part of the first supporting<br>
surface 33 of the pawl plate 30 passes by the pressing end part 58<br>
to slide with contacting against the round surface 59. At the same<br>
time, the end part of the second supporting surface 22 of the pawl<br>
20 slides with contacting against the round surface 54 of a side of<br>
the lower latch 51.<br>
Then, as shown in FIGs. 6 and 7, the latch 50 rotates in the<br>
counterclockwise direction by means of the attraction force of the<br><br>
tension spring 70.<br>
Also, the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are prevented from<br>
additionally rotating in the clockwise direction by means of the end<br>
part of the second supporting surface 22 and the end part of the first<br>
supporting surface 33 contacting and sliding on the two round surfaces<br>
54 and 59 of the latch 50, and the rotation angle thereof is maintained<br>
like that.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 8, the latch 50 additionally rotates in<br>
the counterclockwise direction so that a lower blocking surface 55<br>
of the lower latch 51 can contact and be supported to the second<br>
supporting surface 22 of the pawl 20 to complete the rotating.<br>
At the same time, an upper blocking surface 59-1 of the upper<br>
latch 56 contacts and is supported to the first supporting surface<br>
33 of the pawl plate 30.<br>
Accordingly, the locking pin 2 is capable of being separated<br>
from the depressed groove part 10a and the latch groove part 56a.<br>
In practice, since the base plate 10 is coupled to a lower end<br>
part of the seat, and the locking pin 2 is coupled to a bottom of<br>
the chassis, FIGs. 3 to 8 after operating the above lever of the seat<br>
and operating the pawl 20 represent that the position of the locking<br>
pin 2 is stationary, and the seat, that is, the latch assembly 1 is<br>
lifted upward on the contrary.<br><br>
In FIG. 8, the lower blocking surface 55 and the upper blocking<br>
surface 59-1 are respectively contacted and supported to the second<br>
supporting surface 22 of the pawl 20 and the first supporting surface<br>
33 of the pawl plate 30 so that the latch 50 can constantly maintain<br>
an open state having a predetermined rotation angle.<br>
Hereinafter, a process of the latch assembly for the vehicle<br>
seat 1 from the locking withdrawn state in FIG. 8 to the locking state<br>
will be described.<br>
At first, in the open state in FIG. 8, the seat is put down so<br>
that the locking pin 2 of the bottom can be inserted to the depressed<br>
groove part 10a of the base plate 10. That is, in the figure, if the<br>
locking pin 2 is inserted to the depressed groove part 10a, the latch<br>
groove part 56a is pressed by means of the locking pin 2 so that the<br>
latch 50 can rotate in the clockwise direction.<br>
Then, the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 are respectively separated<br>
from the lower blocking surface 55 and the upper blocking surface<br>
59-1 to move along the two round surfaces 54 and 59 with the respective<br>
rotation positions thereof being stationary so that the end part of<br>
the first supporting surface 33 of the pawl plate 30 can contact to<br>
the pressing end part 58 of the upper latch 56 as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
Then, while the end part of the first supporting surface 33 passes<br>
by the pressing end part 58, the pawl plate 30 rotates in the<br><br>
counterclockwise direction to some extent, and to the contrary, the<br>
pawl 20 maintains a stationary rotation position since the pawl 20<br>
still contacts to the round surface 54 of the lower latch 51.<br>
After the end part of the first supporting surface 33 passes<br>
by the pressing end part 58, the pawl plate 30 rapidly rotates in<br>
the clockwise direction by means of the restitution force of the<br>
torsion spring 80.<br>
At the same time, when the end part of the second supporting<br>
surface 22 passes by the round surface 54, the pawl 20 rapidly rotates<br>
in the clockwise direction by means of the contraction force of the<br>
tension spring 70.<br>
When the rotation of the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 is completed,<br>
the pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 have the same state as shown in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
That is, the pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate 30 contacts<br>
to and presses the upper locking surface 57 of the upper latch 56,<br>
and the end part of the second supporting surface 22 contacts to the<br>
round surface 53 of the lower latch 51 so that the pawl 20 can contact<br>
and be supported thereto.<br>
As described above, when the latch assembly 1 is converted from<br>
the open state into the locking state, the pressing end part 58 of<br>
the upper latch 56 presses the end part of the first supporting surface<br><br>
33 so that the pawl plate 30 can further rotate in the counterclockwise<br>
direction to supply an increased restitution force to the torsion<br>
spring 80, thereby enabling the pressing surface 32 to further<br>
certainly contact to and support the locking surface 57 in the locking<br>
state.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, in the locking state of the latch assembly<br>
1, the locking position of the latch 50 is that the latch groove part<br>
56a contacts to the locking pin 2 as described above. This locking<br>
position may vary depending on the thickness of the locking pin 2<br>
or a right and left position of the locking pin 2 inside the depressed<br>
groove part 10a.<br>
That is, the locking position of the latch 50 may have some<br>
variation in the rotation angle thereof.<br>
Also, this variation may be caused due to an allowable<br>
manufacturing error range of a product, etc.<br>
The latch assembly 1 for the vehicle seat according to the<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention is capable of smoothly<br>
accommodating and coupling the locking pin 2 although the pocking<br>
position of the latch 50 is changed to some extent.<br>
FIGs. 10 and 11 illustrate locking states in which the locking<br>
pin 2 is accommodated to the depressed groove part 10a to be biased<br>
left (referring to FIG. 10) and right (referring to FIG. 11).<br><br>
At first, the depressed groove unit 10a has such a sufficient<br>
width as to accommodate the locking pin 2 with a consideration that<br>
the accommodated position of the locking pin 2 may vary right and<br>
left to some extent.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 10 and 11, if the locking pin 2 is biased left<br>
or right, the locking position of the latch 50 may be a position further<br>
rotated in the clockwise direction or the counterclockwise direction<br>
to some extent than a reference position in FIG. 2.<br>
However, in this case, the pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate<br>
30 maintains contacting to and supporting the locking surface 57 of<br>
the upper latch 56.<br>
Merely, the contact point between the pressing surface 32 and<br>
the locking surface 57 is changed along the locking surface 57 and<br>
the pressing surface 32 in comparison with the case in FIG. 2.<br>
Accordingly, the rotation position of the pawl plate 30 is also<br>
changed as shown in FIGs. 10 and 11.<br>
Alternatively, the locking position of the latch 50 may be<br>
changed according that the thickness of the locking pin 2 varies within<br>
an allowable error range, and this may correspond to the case that<br>
the position of the locking pin 2 varies right and left (referring<br>
to FIGs. 10 and 11).<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the pawl plate 30 further includes an<br><br>
engagement end part 34 protruding from a side of the pressing surface<br>
32 in a radius direction.<br>
The engagement end part 34 prevents the pawl plate 30 from<br>
additionally rotating when the pawl plate 30 rotates to the locking<br>
position so that the locking surface 57 can be contacted and supported<br>
by means of the pressing surface 32 in spite of size error, position<br>
error, etc. of the locking pin 2.<br>
That is, if the pawl plate 30 additionally rotates with the<br>
pressing surface 32 contacting to the locking surface 57, the<br>
engagement end part 34 is engaged to the pressing end part 58 of the<br>
upper latch 56, thereby preventing the pawl plate 30 from additionally<br>
rotating.<br>
When the latch assembly 1 for the vehicle seat is in the locking<br>
state in FIG. 2, if an impact is applied to the chassis, this impact<br>
is transmitted to the rotation of the latch 50 through the locking<br>
pin 2 and the latch groove part 56a, the locking surfaces 52 and 57<br>
and the pressing surface 32 of the pawl plate 30.<br>
This impact may be caused due to an impact applied to a wheel<br>
by means of an unpaved road, etc. while the vehicle travels.<br>
In case of a small impact, the pressing surface 32 of the pawl<br>
plate 30 has a predetermined pressing angle a against the upper locking<br>
surface 57 to absorb an applied supporting force F. However, if a<br><br>
big impact exceeding the supporting force F is generated, the pawl<br>
plate 30 rotates in the counterclockwise direction to some extent<br>
by means of the impact transmission of the upper locking surface 57<br>
so that the first supporting surface 33 of a right side of the pressing<br>
surface 32 can contact to and support the upper locking surface 57<br>
as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
Also, at the same time, the second supporting surface 22 of the<br>
pawl 20 contacts to and supports the lower locking surface 52.<br>
That is, the latch 50 rotates in the counterclockwise direction<br>
together with the pawl plate 30 to some extent, and concurrently,<br>
the rotating latch 50 is simultaneously supported by means of the<br>
pawl 20 and the pawl plate 30 so that the impact generated to the<br>
vehicle can be absorbed.<br>
Accordingly, the impact to the vehicle is capable of being<br>
prevented from being intactly transmitted to a person on the seat,<br>
and being partially absorbed to the latch assembly 1 to be reduced<br>
and transmitted, and the latch 50 is capable of preventing the locking<br>
state of the seat by means of the locking pin 2 from being released<br>
since the latch 50 is doubly supported by means of the pawl 2 and<br>
the pawl plate 30.<br><br>
