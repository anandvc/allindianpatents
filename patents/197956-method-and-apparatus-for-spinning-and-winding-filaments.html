The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for spinning and winding continuous filaments of synthetic high-polymer plastics according to the preamble of claim 1 and according to the preamble of claim 12.<br>
d' A method of this kind and an apparatus of this kind are known from DE 42 03 076. In this case the filaments are removed from the spinning zone at a high take-off speed by means of a delivery mechanism. The delivery mechanism consists of two godets, around which the filaments partly loop. A filament tensile force is in the process built up in the filaments above the godets and causes the filaments to be drawn. The filament tensile force at which the filaments are wound is lower than the filament tensile force built up for drawing purposes.<br>
In the known method the filament tensile force is reduced due to the fact that the delivery mechanism is driven at a circumferential speed which is greater than the filament running speed. A filament tensile force level which is low for winding is therefore set immediately after the filament runs off the last godet. The filaments are guided to the individual winding stations of a winding device after running off the godet.<br>
This case entails the problem of each filament having a specific filament tensile force which is dependent upon the filament course. Because they are deflected to a greater or lesser degree after leaving the spinning zone, the filaments already have varying tensile forces upon entering the delivery mechanism. The filaments are gathered together before running onto the delivery mechanism and spread apart after leaving the latter in order to be guided to the respective winding position, especially in spinning plant where a high number of filaments are to be simultaneously spun in parallel in the spinning zone. This results in<br><br>
significant variations in filament tensile force between<br>
the individual winding positions.<br>
These differences in filament tensile force give rise at<br>
the winding positions to packages of widely differing<br>
quality.<br>
Also known from the PCT patent application WO 96/09425 are a method and an apparatus in which two long godets permitting a parallel filament course are disposed before the winding device. Godets of a length in excess of 120 cm consequently have to be used for spinning apparatus with eight and more filaments spun at the same time. In order to be able to feed the filaments, the godets are only mounted on one side in a projecting manner on a carrier. This means that long godets of this kind can only be used with an average filament speed. When filament speeds exceed 6,000 m/min. and the godet diameter is in the range from 100 to 150 mm, the godets have to be driven at speeds of up to 20,000 rpm, which entails considerable problems in terms of service life.<br>
The object of the invention is consequently to provide a method and an apparatus for spinning and winding continuous filaments, in which method the filaments are wound with a preselectable filament tensile force in each winding station and at a high filament speed.<br>
This object is achieved with a method having the features of claim 1 and with an apparatus having the features of claim 12.<br>
Advantageous developments of the method and the apparatus are presented in the subclaims.<br>
The advantage offered by the invention lies in the possibility of eliminating the individual influences on the tensile force of a filament which can occur from spinning<br><br>
to winding, such as, e.g. during cooling, processing, twisting, heating or filament guidance. A filament tensile force which is determined by the delivery mechanism associated with the filament can be set at each filament independently of the adjacent filaments. The filament can be spooled with the filament tensile force which produces optimum package build-up, particularly for winding. When producing dyed filaments of different colours, for example, the filaments have different properties which also have different effects when winding in different packages. However the method according to the invention enables the same package qualities to be produced in each winding station.<br>
When producing filaments having essentially the same physical properties, the aim is to wind the filaments with the same filament tension. This problem can be solved by means of a particularly advantageous development of the method according to the invention. A package having the same winding structure and the same packing density can therefore be wound in each winding station.<br>
A particularly advantageous variant of the method enables the filaments to be guided with a high tensile force until just before they enter the winding zone. This guarantees reliable godet operation for drawing the filament, with no risk of lap formation when running off the godet.<br>
By controlling or regulating the delivery mechanisms in accordance with the filament tensile force measured in the filament course before the delivery mechanisms, it is possible to react directly to variations during the process. The control or regulation can be carried out by means of the variable circumferential speed or the variable filament looping.<br><br>
The development of the invention based on measuring the prevailing filament tensile force in the filament course after the delivery mechanism has the advantage of also compensating for the variations in filament tensile force originating from the winding operation, such as, e.g. traversing. It is in particular also possible to compensate for the reduction in filament tensile force when changing the filament from the full package to the empty tube. In this case a filament brake is used to build up a greater filament tensile force, as described in DE 40 33 960. A high level of running reliability and catching reliability is thus achieved when carrying out a bobbin change.<br>
In order to keep expenditure for adjusting the individual delivery mechanisms to a minimum, it is advantageous to control the delivery mechanisms in accordance with the filament tensile force of a reference point. Should the filaments be spread apart when running off a godet disposed before the winding zone in order to reach the individual winding stations, the filaments which lie on the outside and are therefore deflected the most have a higher filament tensile force level than those in the middle. In this respect it is advantageous to locate the reference measurement point in the course of one of the middle filaments.<br>
The method may, however, also be modified so that a certain filament tensile force level is predetermined ij\ order, for example, to obtain a certain spooling quality.<br>
The variant in which the delivery mechanisms are formed by two driven rollers around which the filament loops in the shape of an S is particularly suitcQsle for reducing the filament tensile force, so that the latter is at a lower level in the filament course after the delivery mechanisms than before the delivery mechanism. The two delivery rollers may also be disposed in relation to one another<br><br>
such that the filament loops around them in the shape of a Z.<br>
The variant of the method in which the delivery mechanisms are formed by two non-driven rollers around which the filament loops in the shape of an S is particularly suitable for increasing the filament tensile force in the winding zone.<br>
The method according to the invention is suitable for achieving fully or partially drawn filaments (FOY or POY) in one operation. All kinds of filament materials such as polypropylene, polyester, polyamide and viscose can in this respect be advantageously spun and wound according to this method.<br>
The invention also offers the advantage of the filament tensile force measurement simultaneously serving to monitor the filament quality, as described in EP 0644 282. In this case the measurement signals obtained in particular in the filament course before the delivery mechanism could serve to influence the actual run of the process in the spinning zone and in the drawing zone.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous development of the apparatus, the delivery mechanisms are connected to the machine frame of the winding device. It is thus possible to set a filament tensile force in the filament directly before it enters the head filament guide of the winding device. Moreover, the operability of the delivery mechanisms can be linked with the operation of the winding device. A person responsible for operating the winding device could directly influence the quality of the wound packages through the operation of the delivery mechanisms.<br>
In addition, by disposing the delivery mechanisms directly before the head filament guide, the filament oscillations<br><br>
resulting from the traversing movement can only continue as far as the delivery mechanism. It has already emerged that a delivery mechanism with a driven delivery roller around which the filament partly loops has improved the quality of the wound filament, in particular its ability to absorb dye. The delivery roller around which the filament loops is in this case driven at a circumferential speed which is greater than the filament running speed. In this connection slippage occurs between the filament and the circumference of the delivery roller and reduces the filament tensile force. However the delivery roller could also be driven such that its circumferential speed is lower than the filament running speed. This produces braking effects which increase the filament tension when winding.<br>
Another preferred variant is formed by a delivery mechanism with three driven delivery rollers. An apparatus of this kind is particularly suitable for reducing high filament tensile forces. It is thus possible to produce packages with a very low filament tensile force level.<br>
In order to influence the setting of the filament tensile force within the delivery mechanism, it is advantageous to construct at least one of the rollers such that it can be swivelled into or out of the filament course. It is thus possible to influence the angle of loop at the rollers and hence the frictional conditions between the filament and the respective surfaces of the deliveiry rollers.<br>
Furthermore, the spinning apparatus, at which the delivery mechanism can adopt an operating condition in which the filament tensile force is not influenced, has the advantage of the possibility of the filaments being fed into the delivery mechanisms in a simple manner. The delivery rollers may in this connection comprise a feed slope provided at the circumference for assistance.<br><br>
In another, particularly advantageous development of the invention the delivery rollers at the delivery mechanism are driven independently of one another. This produces another parameter for varying the setting of the tensile force in the filament. The rollers can in this case be driven by means of individual motors or via group drives. The individual motor drive is of advantage if significant differences in filament tensile force occur in the individual filaments spun side by side.<br>
When the filaments run essentially parallel to one another, the delivery rollers of adjacent delivery mechanisms may preferably be driven by a group drive.<br>
If the delivery mechanisms are directly connected to the winding device, it is particularly advantageous to integrate the delivery mechanisms into the operating cycle of the winding device. This means that when a bobbin change is carried out the delivery mechanisms can be directly controlled via the control unit of the winding device such that the filament does not become slack, for example, when changing over.<br>
As a result of controlling or regulating the delivery mechanisms in accordance with the measured filament tensile force in the filament course before the deliveiry mechanism, it is possible to react directly to variations during the process.<br>
Further features, advantages and possible applications of the present invention will emerge from the following description of embodiments in conjunction with the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a first embodiment of a spinning apparatus according to the invention;<br><br><br><br>
After the filament bundle 4 'has left the spinneret 3, the filament bundle 4 passes through a cboling duct 2. The filament bundle 4 is in the process preferably cooled with quench air. Following cooling the filament bundle 4 is brought together to form a filament 12 in the filament guide 5. The filament 12 then passes through a processing device 6 in order to produce a finished filament. The processing device 6 could also take the place of the filament guide 5, in which case the filament guide 5 would be dispensed with. The filament 12 is subsequently guided into a drawing zone, which is formed by the godets 8 and 10. Here the drawing jpone is marked by a dot-dash surround in Figure 1. As the width of the spinning zone of the spinning stations disposed in parallel side by side is greater than the width of the running surface of the godet 8, the filaments must be deflected to a respective filament guide 7 to a gre«iter or lesser degree in accordance with their position in order to pass via the godets 8 and 10 in parallel. The godet 8 is driven by the godet motor 9. The godet; 10 is driven by the godet motor 11. Here the godet 10 is difiven at a higher circumferential speed than the godet 8. Tl^e filament 12 loops around the godets 8 and 10 in the shape of an S or a Z. In this drawing zone formation the godet 8 is heated in order to heat the filament.<br>
It is, however, also possible to dispose a heating device between the processing device 6 and the godet 8 in order tc draw and set the filament. The heating device may in this case be formed as a straight heating tube or as a heating rail.<br>
After the filament has run off the godet 10, the filament 12 is guided by the filament guide 21 to a head filament guide 14. The stationary head filament guide 14 belongs to one of a total o;f four winding stations 41 of a winding device. In each winding station 41 the filament passes through a traversing device 15,' which lays the filament 12<br><br>
co-ana-rro essentially transversely to the filament running direction along a traversing stroke. The traversing device 15 may be formed as a vane-type traversing device or as a reversing threaded shaft traversing device. The so-called traversing triangle fo|Tn^ between the traversing device 15 and the head filament guide 14. The filament runs onto a pressure roll 16 which is disposed after the traversing device and is rotatably mounted in the machine frame 20. The filament loops partly around the pressure roll 16, which is then deposited on the package 18. The package 18 is held on a spooling spindle 17. The spooling spindle 17 is driven by means of the spindle motor 19. The spindle motor 19 is regulated in accordance with the circumferential spe^d of the pressure roll such that the ttircumferential speed of tjie package is always constant, so that' the filament is spooled with^ a constant winding speed.<br>
As the spooling spindle 17 i»  longer than the godet 10, the filaments 12 have to be deflected to a greater or lesser degj^ee after running off the godet 10 in order to enter the respective winding station in parallel. As it is only possible to bring the filaments together before the godet 8 and move them apart after the godet 10 with the aid of filament guides 7 and 21, a frictional force dependent upon the degree of deflection is produced in the filament 12. Different filament tensile forces are thus built up in each filament. Where a high-quality yarn is concerned, however, the filament has to be wound into a package with an essentially constant filament tensile force. According to the invention the filament 12 passes through a respective delivery mechanism 13,* the operating mode of which is described in the following. The delivery mechanism 13 is disposed between the filament guide 21 and the head filament guide 14. A filament tensile force is reduced or built up at the filament 12 in the delivery mechanism 13. The filament tensile force is reduced in the spinning plant shown in Figure 1. In this case the delivery mechanisms 13<br><br>
in each filament course are set such that the filaments exhibit essentially the same filament tensile force in the filament course after the delivery mechanism 13. The reduction in tens ion is therefore greater in the outer filaments, on account of the greater deflection, than in the middle filaments. Each of the delivery mechanisms thus has a predetermined setting which is dependent on the filament course.<br>
The method described in Figure 1 is advantageously used to produce POY. However in this case it is also possible to take the filaments directly off the winding device out of the spinning zone without the interposition of a drawing system (godets). The structure of the spinning apparatus would correspon4 to the spinning apparatus from Figure 1 without the drawing zone marked by dot-dash lines. The filaments pass through the respective delivery mechanisms to set the filament tensile force before they enter the winding devices. The filaments are advantageously guided in parallel out of the spinning zone until they reach the delivery mechanisms.<br>
Figure 2 shows a spinning device which is particularly suitable for producing FDY. As the method cycle from spinning to winding is dimil^ir to the spinning method illustrgjted in Figure 1, only the differences with respect to the method and the apparatus according to Figure 1 are described at this point. Ot^herwise the description relating tq Figure 1 will be referred to.<br>
After leaving the spinning zone the filaments 12.1 to 12.4 are brought together such that they can run onto the godet 24 at a slight distance from one another. A filament guide 22 disposed before the godet 24 serves this purpose. The filaments 12 loop around the godet 24 several times, being guided to-and-fro between a transfer roller 23 and the godet 24. The filaments are taken off the godet 24 by a<br><br><br><br><br><br>
connected to a filament tensile force sensor 31.3. the latter being disposed in the filament course after the delivery mechanism 13.3. The measurement of the filament tensile force carried out on the filament 12.3 is in this case used as a reference measurement point. The measurement signal of the filament tensile force sensor 13.3 is delivered via the control device 32.| to the control unit 39. The reference signal is transmitted from the control unit 39 to the control devices 32.1, 32.2 and 32.4.<br>
In the control device 32.1, 32.2 and 32.4 the reference signal is compared with the signal from the filament tensile force measurement in the filament course before the respective delivery mechanism. The difference is then preset as the control signal of the respective delivery mechanism. This results in the filaments 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 having the same filament tensile force upon entering the winding zone.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment which, when compared with the arrangement of Figure 2, differs in that the filament tensile force sensor 31 is disposed in the filament course after the delivery mechanism 13 instead of in the filament course before the delivery mechanism. This arrangement is particularly suitable for regulating the filament tensile force. For this purpose the control device 40 is in each case provided with a predetermined filament tensile force by a control unit 39, this being set by way of the delivery mechanism 13. As a result of measuring the filament tensile force after the delivery mechanism via the filament tensile force sensor 31, the measurement signal is supplied to the control device 40 and compared with the predetermined value. The differences between the predetermined value and the measured value are supplied as controlling variables to the delivery mechanism 13. This arrangement has the additional advantage of enabling variations in filament tensile force resulting from the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
that the second spooling spindle is swivelled with empty tubes into the appropriate operating position.<br>
The winding device shown in Figures 6 and 7 could be used in the spinning apparatus frpm Figure 1 or 2. it is, however, also possible to use a winding device of this kind in a spinning plant in which the filaments lie in a parallel course between the spinneret and the winding stations.<br>
Figure 8 shows another embodiment of a delivery mechanism as could be used in the spinning apparatus from Figures 1 and 2 or in ^ winding device according to Figure 6. Here the delivery mechanism consists of three delivery rollers 42, 43 and 53. The delivery rollers 42 and 43 are disposed at a distance from one another parallel to the course of the filament 12. The delivery roller 42 is driven by the drive shaft 47 and the delivery rotler 43' by the drive shaft 48. The delivery roller 53 is connected to a drive shaft 54, which is mounted in a fork 55. The fork 55 is disposed on an adjustment device 56, so that the fork 55 can be displaced essentially transversely to the filament ' running direction. The delivery roller 53 is disposed on the opposite side of the filament course with respect to the delivery rollers 42 and 43. In the illustrated position :he adjustment device 56 with the delivery roller 53 is shown in the drawn-in state and hence swivelled out of the Eilaflient course. The filament 12 can now pass unobstructed :hrough the delivery mechanism without looping. The ielivery roller 53 is now positioned in the centre between :he delivery rollers 42 and 43. As the distance between the ielivery rollers 42 and 43 ip gteater than the diameter of :he roller 53, the roller SsSican be swivelled into the space between the delivery rollers 42 and 43 by means of :he adjustment device 56. The delivery roller 53 then jasses through the plane of the filament course, so that :he filament 12 is forcibly guided by the delivery roller<br><br><br>
