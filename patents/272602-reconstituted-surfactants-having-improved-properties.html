				<td>RECONSTITUTED SURFACTANTS HAVING IMPROVED PROPERTIES<br>
The present invention is directed to a reconstituted surfactant<br>
comprising a lipid carrier, and a combination of particular polypeptide<br>
analogs of the native surfactant protein SP-C with polypeptides comprising a<br>
sequence of repeated units constituted by a number of hydrophobic amino<br>
acid residues comprised between 3 and 8 and one basic amino acid residue.<br>
The invention is also directed to the corresponding pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and to their use for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of RDS<br>
and other respiratory disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The human lung is composed of a large number of small air sacs,<br>
called alveoli, in which gases are exchanged between the blood and the air<br>
spaces of the lungs. In healthy individuals, this exchange is mediated by the<br>
presence of a protein-containing surfactant complex that prevents the lungs<br>
from collapsing at the end of expiration.<br>
Lung surfactant complex is composed primarily of lipid and contains<br>
minor amounts of various proteins. An absence of adequate levels of this<br>
complex results in malfunction of the lung. This syndrome is called<br>
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and it commonly affects preterm<br>
infants.<br>
Said syndrome is effectively treated with modified natural surfactant<br>
preparations extracted from animal lungs.<br>
Commercially available modified surfactant preparations are, for<br>
example, Curosurf, derived from porcine lung, Infasurf, extracted from calf<br>
lung lavage and Survanta, a chemically modified natural bovine lung extract.<br>
The main constituents of these surfactant preparations are<br>
phospholipids, such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,<br>
commonly known as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),<br>
phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and surfactant hydrophobic proteins B and C<br>
(SP-B and SP-C).<br>
Due to the drawbacks of the surfactant preparations from animal<br>
tissues, such as the complex production and sterilization processes and<br>
possible induction of immune reactions, synthetic surfactants mimicking the<br>
composition of the modified natural surfactants have been developed.<br>
Said synthetic surfactants are known as reconstituted surfactants.<br>
However the development of clinically active reconstituted surfactants<br>
has turned out to be complicated since the native hydrophobic proteins are<br>
too big to synthesize, structurally complex and unstable in pure form.<br>
In order to replace said native hydrophobic proteins, some synthetic<br>
polypeptides partially corresponding to their sequences and analogs thereof<br>
have been proposed in the prior art, and are for example disclosed in<br>
WO 89/06657, WO 92/22315, WO 95/32992, US 6,660,833, EP 413,957,<br>
WO 91/18015 and WO 00/47623.<br>
However, according to the available literature, in animal studies, the<br>
treatment with reconstituted surfactants gives rise to poor lung gas volumes<br>
and grade of alveolar patency at the end of expiration, and a ventilation is<br>
required with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in order to achieve<br>
an in vivo activity comparable to that achieved with modified natural<br>
surfactants (Johansson J et al J Appl Physiol 2003, 95, 2055-2063; Davis AJ<br>
et al Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1998; 157, 553-559).<br>
The available reconstituted surfactant preparations are indeed not able<br>
to form a stable phospholipid film in the alveoli at the end of expiration.<br>
Therefore there is still an unmet need for a reconstituted surfactant<br>
with improved properties in terms of lung compliance.<br>
In particular there is a need for a reconstituted surfactant preparation<br>
which is able to guarantee alveolar stability, and hence to maintain alveolar<br>
stability at the end of expiration without requiring ventilation with PEEP.<br>
It has now been found, and it is the object of the present invention,<br>
that particular polypeptide analogs of the native SP-C protein can<br>
advantageously be combined with particular polypeptides comprising a<br>
sequence alternating a number of hydrophobic amino acid residues<br>
comprised between 3 and 8 and one basic amino acid residue in order to<br>
provide a reconstituted surfactant preparation with improved properties in<br>
terms of lung compliance, and in particular, in terms of capacity to effectively<br>
maintain alveolar patency at the end of expiration without requiring<br>
ventilation with PEEP.<br>
In a model of RDS wherein the immature newborn were treated with<br>
exogenous surfactant preparations without applying PEEP, a combination of<br>
said polypeptides acts on the lung gas volumes which is an index of the<br>
alveolar patency at the end of expiration.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a reconstituted surfactant<br>
comprising a lipid carrier and a combination of polypeptides of general<br>
formula (I) with polypeptides comprising a sequence of repeated units<br>
constituted of a number of hydrophobic amino acid residues comprised<br>

We have indeed found that, in a model of RDS wherein immature<br>
newborn were treated with exogenous surfactant preparations without<br>

The polypeptides of general formulae (I) and (II) may be prepared by<br>
any known technique such as those described in J.M. Steward and J.D.<br>
Young, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", W.H. Freeman Co., San Francisco,<br>
1969, and J. Meienhofer, Hormonal Proteins and Peptides", Vol.2, p. 46,<br>
Academic Press (New York), 1983 for solid phase peptide synthesis, and E.<br>
Schroder and K. Kubke, "The Peptides", Vol. 1, Academic Press (New York),<br>
1965 for classical solution synthesis. A summary of polypeptide synthesis<br>
techniques may be found in J. Stuart and J.D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide<br>
Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL, 3d Ed., Neurath, H. et<br>
al., Eds., p. 104-237, Academic Press, New York, NY (1976).<br>
Appropriate protective groups for use in such syntheses will be found<br>
in the above texts as well as in J.F.W. McOmie, Protective Grouts in Organic<br>
Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, NY (1973).<br>
In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or<br>
more amino acid residues or suitably protected amino acid residues to a<br>
growing peptide chain. Usually, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first<br>
amino acid residue is protected by a suitable, selectively removable<br>
protecting group.<br>
Using a solid phase synthesis by way of example, the protected or<br>
derivatized amino acid is attached to an inert solid support through its<br>
unprotected carboxyl or amino group. The amino- or carboxyl- protecting<br>
group is then selectively removed and the next amino acid in the sequence<br>
having the complementary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected is<br>
admixed and reacted under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage<br>
with the residue already attached to the solid support. The amino- or<br>
carboxyl- protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid<br>
residue, and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so<br>
forth.<br>
After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper<br>
sequence, any remaining terminal and side group protecting groups (and<br>
solid support) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to obtain the final<br>
polypeptide.<br>
In particular the polypeptides of general formulae (I) and (III) may be<br>
prepared according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/47623, while the<br>
polypeptides consisting of a sequence of general formula (II) may be<br>
prepared according to the methods described in WO 92/22315.<br>
The reconstituted surfactant of the invention may be prepared by<br>
mixing a solution or a suspension of the polypeptides of general formula (I)<br>
and (II) and lipids and by subsequently drying the mixture, otherwise they<br>
may be prepared by lyophilisation or spray-drying.<br>
Preferably, the polypeptides of general formula (I) and the polypeptides<br>
of general formula (II) are present in the reconstituted surfactants of the<br>
invention in a fixed amount and quantitative ratio as a fixed combination.<br>
The proportion of the polypeptides of general formulae (I) and (II) to<br>
the reconstituted surfactant can vary. Advantageously, each polypeptide may<br>
be present in an amount comprised between 0.5 and 10% based on the<br>
weight of the surfactant (w/w), preferably between 1 and 5%, most preferably<br>
between 1 and 3%.<br>
Advantageously, the lipid carrier comprises the phospholipids that are<br>
contained in natural pulmonary surfactant preparations, for example<br>
phosphatidylcholines (PC) such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)<br>
and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and phosphatidylglycerols<br>
(PG), such as palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and<br>
dipalmitoylposphatidylglycerol (DPPG).<br>
Other phospholipids which can be advantageously used are<br>
phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE),<br>
phosphatidylserines and sphingomyelins (SM).<br>
In a particular embodiment, the lipid carrier may comprise further<br>
components, for example neutral lipids such as triacylglycerols, free fatty<br>
acids and/or cholesterol.<br>
Advantageously, the reconstituted surfactant according to the invention<br>
comprises 90 to 99% by weight of the lipid carrier, preferably 92 to 98%,<br>
more preferably 94 to 96%, and 1 to 10% by weight of the sum of both<br>
peptides, preferably 2 to 8%, more preferably 4 to 6%.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention the reconstituted surfactant<br>
comprises 96% by weight of a lipid carrier, 2% by weight of a polypeptide of<br>
general formula (I) and 2% by weight of a polypeptide of general formula (II).<br>
The phospholipids comprised in the lipid carrier are preferably<br>
mixtures consisting of DPPC and a palmitoyloleylphospholipid selected from<br>
POPG or a mixture thereof with POPC in weight ratios ranging from 95:5 to<br>
50:50, preferably from 80:20 to 60:40. The weight ratio of DPPC to POPG<br>
ranges preferably from 75:25 to 65:35, and is more preferably 68:31. In the<br>
case of DPPC:POPG:POPC mixtures, the phospholipids are preferably used<br>
in weight ratios of 60:20:20 or 68:15:16.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reconstituted surfactant comprises<br>
from 1 to 5% by weight of a polypeptide of general formula (la), from 1 to 5%<br>
by weight of a polypeptide of formula (II) and a mixture of DPPC and POPG<br>
in a weight ratio of 68:31.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment, the reconstituted surfactant<br>
comprises from 1.5 to 3% by weight of a polypeptide selected from the group<br>
consisting of (le), (If), (lg) and (In), more preferably the polypeptide (If), from<br>
1.5 to 3% by weight of a peptide of general formula (II) and a mixture of<br>
DPPC and POPG in a weight ratio of 68:31.<br>
The administration of the reconstituted surfactant of the invention is<br>
carried out conventionally, preferably by intratracheal instillation (infusion or<br>
bolus) or by nebulisation.<br>
The effective dose of the reconstituted surfactant varies depending<br>
upon many different factors including means of administration, type and<br>
severity of the disease and whether the treatment is prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic. In general the dose is comprised between 0.01 mg and 10 g per<br>
kg of body weight, preferably between 10 and 500 mg per kg, more<br>
preferably between 40 and 200 mg per kg. The skilled person can easily<br>
determine the optimum dose and frequency of administration thereof.<br>
The present invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising the reconstituted surfactant of the invention. Said compositions<br>
are advantageously administered in the form of a solution, dispersion,<br>
suspension or dry powder. Preferably said compositions comprise the<br>
reconstituted surfactant dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent or<br>
resuspension medium.<br>
Preferably, said pharmaceutical compositions are supplied as<br>
suspension in a buffered physiological saline aqueous solution in single-use<br>
glass vials. Advantageously the reconstituted surfactant concentration<br>
(expressed as phospholipid content) is in the range of from about 2 to about<br>
160 mg of surfactant per ml, preferably between 10 and 100 mg/ml, more<br>
preferably between 20 and 80 mg/ml.<br>
To achieve a lower viscosity, said compositions may further comprise<br>
electrolytes, such as calcium, magnesium and/or sodium salts (for example<br>
calcium chloride or sodium chloride).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are<br>
suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome<br>
(RDS) in prematurely born babies or other diseases related to a surfactant-<br>
deficiency or dysfunction including acute lung injury (ALI), RDS in adults<br>
(ARDS), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), and bronchopulmonary<br>
dysplasia (BPD).<br>
They can also be useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of other<br>
respiratory disorders such as pneumonia, bronchitis, COPD (chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma, and cystic fibrosis as well as for the<br>
treatment of serous otitis media (glue ear).<br>
The following example illustrates the invention in more details.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
In vivo experiments with a reconstituted surfactant based on the<br>
polypeptides SP-C33 and KL4<br>
The surfactant preparations are assayed in premature newborn<br>
rabbits, obtained by hysterectomy at the gestational age of 27 days. The<br>
experiments are performed without applying a positive end expiratory<br>
pressure (PEEP).<br>
As SP-C analog, the polypeptide referred to as SP-C33 is used which<br>
is prepared as described in WO 00/47623.<br>
As analog of the protein SP-B, the polypeptide referred to as KL4 was<br>
used, which is prepared according to the teaching of WO 92/22315.<br>
The animals are treated at birth with 200 mg/kg (80 mg/ml) of<br>
reconstituted surfactant preparations containing 2% SP-C33 or 2% SP-C33+<br>
2% KL4 in combination with a phospholipid mixture consisting of<br>
DPPC:POPG in the ratio 68:31 w/w.<br>
Animals treated with Curosurf® (80 mg/ml) serve as positive controls<br>
and non-treated littermates as negative controls.<br>
The immature newborn rabbits are ventilated in parallel with a<br>
standardized sequence of peak insufflation pressures. To open up the lungs,<br>
pressure is first set at 35 cmhbO for 1 min. After this recruitment manoeuvre,<br>
pressure is lowered to 25 cmFbO for 15 min and further on to 20 and 15 cm<br>
H2O. Finally, pressure is raised again to 25 cmhhO for 5 min, after which the<br>
lungs are ventilated for additional 5 min with nitrogen and then excised for<br>
gas volume measurements.<br>
Both lung gas volumes and tidal volumes expressed as ml/kg are<br>
measured and the results, given as median values, are reported in Figures 4<br>
and 5, respectively.<br>
Figure 3 shows that animals treated with the reconstituted surfactant<br>
preparation containing 2% w/w SP-C33 in combination with 2% KL4 had<br>
higher lung gas volumes than animals that received 2% w/w SP-C33,<br>
indicating that addition of 2% w/w KL4 to SP-C33 surfactant produced an<br>
increment in lung gas volumes.<br>
Said result demonstrates that the reconstituted surfactant of the<br>
invention provides better stabilization of the phospholipid film in the alveoli at<br>
the end of expiration than a reconstituted surfactant preparation comprising<br>
only an analog of the protein SP-C.<br>
Moreover Figure 4 shows that the claimed reconstituted surfactant<br>
preparation turned out to significantly improve the respiratory function as<br>
expressed by the tidal volumes.<br>
