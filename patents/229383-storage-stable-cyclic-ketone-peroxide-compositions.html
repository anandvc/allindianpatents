STORAGE  STABLE  CYCLIC  KETONE  PEROXIDE   COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to peroxide compositions comprising one or more crystallizing cyclic ketone peroxides, one or more dialkyl peroxides, arid, optionally, one or more conventional phlegmatisers. The present invention also pertains to the use of such compositions in polymerization and (co)polymer modification processes.<br>
US 5,808,110 discloses transportable, storage stable cyclic ketone peroxide compositions, which comprise one or more cyclic ketone peroxides and one or more diluents selected from the group consisting of liquid phlegmatisers for cyclic ketone peroxides, plasticizers, solid polymeric carriers, inorganic supports, organic peroxides, and mixtures thereof. In these compositions at least 20% of the total active oxygen content must be attributable to one or more cyclic ketone peroxides. However, the compositions that are disclosed have such a high active oxygen content of the cyclic ketone peroxides that they impair a safety hazard when stored at -10°C or below due to the formation of explosive crystals, which results in an explosion when heated and thus impairs an enormous safety hazard.<br>
A solution for this problem of explosive crystals is provided in non-published patent application EP-A-02080128, which discloses a cyclic ketone peroxide composition comprising one or more crystallizing peroxides, optionally one or more conventional phlegmatisers (diluents), and a co-crystallizing compound which solidifies in the final composition at a solidification temperature above the crystallization temperature of the crystallizing peroxide. Although compositions of EP-A-02080128 have many advantageous properties, i.e. they have a high active oxygen content and they are safe and storage stable, these compositions are not suitable for all types of polymerization and (co)polymer modification processes. For example, in the production process of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), the co-crystallizing compound solidifies under the high pressure reaction conditions that are applied, which may block the conduits of the<br><br>
(tubular) reactor system, particularly the peroxide dosing conduits, that is used.<br>
It is not desired to simply dilute the compositions of US 5,808,110, since this results in compositions with a too low active oxygen content. The manufacture of a cyclic ketone peroxide composition with high total active oxygen content is advantageous with respect to efficient use of the reactor and the reagents and to prevent contamination of polymers, produced with these peroxide compositions, with undesired diluent.<br>
Hence, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cyclic ketone peroxide composition comprising one or more crystallizing cyclic ketone peroxides, wherein the composition has a high active oxygen content and, furthermore, has good safety and storage stability. It is another object of the present invention to provide a cyclic ketone peroxide composition that is suitable for use in polymerization and (co)polymer modification processes, even for processes that require increased or high pressure.<br>
The   present   invention   provides   a   cyclic   ketone   peroxide   composition<br>
comprising:<br>
-    one or more crystallizing cyclic ketone peroxides of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein R1-R6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, linear or branched C1-C20 alky1, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, C6-C20 aryl, C7-C20 aralkyl and C7-C20 alkaryl, and each of R1-R6 may be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from hydroxy, C1-C20 alkoxy,<br><br>
linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl, C6~C2o aryloxy, halogen, ester, carboxy, nitrile, and amido,<br>
one or more dialkyl peroxides according to formula R7-0-0-R8 (II), wherein R7 and  Rs are  independently selected from the group consisting  of substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched C4-C20, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, C6-C20 aryl, C7-C20 aralkyl, and C7-C20 alkaryl, and optionally, one or more conventional phlegmatisers (diluents).<br>
The active oxygen content of a peroxide as described in this description is calculated according to the formula: 16 x the number of peroxide bonds / molecular weight of the peroxide x 100%. The active oxygen content of a composition is a weighed average of ail compounds of the composition.<br>
The term "crystallizing cyclic ketone peroxide" in this description is used for any cyclic ketone peroxide having an active oxygen content of 3.5% or more and optionally diluted with Isopar® M that forms crystals when subjected to the "crystallization test" as described below.<br>
Cyclic ketone peroxide formulations in accordance with the invention do not form explosive crystals when subjected to the "crystallization test" and have sufficiently high active oxygen content to allow a generic use. Furthermore, addition of a seed crystal to the composition of the present invention does not initiate crystal growth of the seeds, nor does it result in the formation of additional crystals, not even at a temperature as low as -25°C, such as applied in the "crystallization test". Particularly preferred is the situation wherein the added seed crystals dissolve in the composition, even at a temperature as low as -25°C. Consequently, compositions according to this invention are safe and storage stable. The terms "storage stable" and "storage stability" used in the description mean that the composition is not liable to explode when stored, or heated after storage, at a minimum storage temperature of -20°C and a maximum storage temperature that is determined by the maximum storage<br><br>
temperature of the most labile peroxide in the composition. In addition, these compositions are suitable for many kinds of polymerization and (co)polymer modification processes, including processes that require increased or high pressure.<br>
Preferred cyclic ketone peroxides that can be used in a cyclic ketone peroxide composition according to this invention include the cyclic ketone peroxides derived from acetone,  acetyl acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl hexyl ketone, methyl heptyl ketone, diethyl ketone, ethyl propyl ketone, ethyl amyl ketone, methyl octyl ketone,     methyl     nonyl     ketone,     cyclopentanone,     cyclohexanone,     2-rhethylcyclohexanone,  3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexanone,  and mixtures thereof. More preferred is the use of cyclic ketone peroxides derived from acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isopropyi ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone,   cyclohexanone,   and   mixtures thereof.  The   use  of cyclic  ketone peroxide derived from methyl ethyl ketone, and optionally, further ketones, is most preferred. The preparation of cyclic ketone peroxides from the appropriate ketone generally results in a mixture of peroxides, which predominantly consists of the trimeric and dimeric forms. However, the mixture of peroxides may also comprise some linear as well as some tetrameric and higher oligomeric cyclic structures. The ratio between the various forms, notably the trimer/dimer ratio, mainly depends on the reaction conditions during the preparation, and the person skilled in the art is referred to WO 96/03397 for obvious variations in the reaction conditions that can be carried out in order to influence this ratio. Preferably, the cyclic ketone peroxide consists essentially of trimer and dimer. If so desired, the reaction mixture may be separated into the individual cyclic ketone peroxide compounds. However, in order to avoid laborious purification procedures, the composition of the invention will typically contain some dimeric structures next to trimeric structures, as defined above. Preference for certain compositions or individual compounds may depend on differences in physical<br><br>
properties or requirements in the application of the peroxides, e.g. storage stability, half-life time vs. temperature, volatility, boiling point, solubility, etc.<br>

Also mixtures of one or more of these conventional phlegmatisers may be used.

The safety of the composition of the present invention was determined by keeping the composition at -25°C for 48 hours, followed by examination of the composition for the presence of crystals ("crystallization test"). (If no crystals are formed after 24 hours at -25°C, a very small amount of seed crystals of pure cyclic ketone peroxide is added to the composition. After addition of the seed crystals, the composition is set aside for another 24 hours at -25°C. Finally, the composition is examined. The composition is considered safe and stable if:<br>
-	the seed crystals did not grow (provided that seed crystals were added),<br>
-	no crystals are present or (in case seed crystals were added) no additional<br><br>
crystals are present, or, -    the composition is completely free of crystals, i.e. even optionally added seed crystals have dissolved.<br>
In addition to the above described "crystallization test", the composition of the present invention should also pass the following conventional safety tests: Deflagration test (deflagration), Time Pressure test (deflagration), Koenen test (heating under defined confinement), Pressure Vessel test (PVT) (heating under defined confinement), and Thermal Explosion Vessel test (heating under defined confinement). Passing these tests means a "medium" or "low" rating in the heating under defined confinement tests and a "no" or "yes, slowly" rating in the deflagration tests. The final hazard rating, for which the most severe rating in any one of the tests is used, must be "medium" or "low." The safety tests and corresponding criteria are documented in the "United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and Criteria".<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the cyclic ketone peroxide is manufactured directly in one or more of the conventional phlegmatisers as described above, followed by combining the cyclic ketone peroxide/conventional phlegmatiser mixture with one or more dialkyl peroxides of formula (II). Optionally, one or more additional conventional phlegmatisers may be added. As already mentioned above, the manufacture of a cyclic ketone peroxide composition with high total active oxygen content is advantageous with respect to efficient use of the reactor and the reagents.<br>
For storing and transporting bulk quantities of the composition according to this invention it may be necessary to (further) dilute the cyclic ketone peroxide composition of the invention with one or more dialkyl peroxides of formula (II) and/or one or more conventional phlegmatisers, such that it complies with regulations for safe storage and transport. This is particularly the case for bulk<br><br>
quantities, which are stored and transported in tanks and intermediate bulk containers (IBCs). The dialkyi peroxide(s) and conventional phlegmatiser(s) are preferably added after the preparation of the cyclic ketone peroxide, as long as it is added before storage. If so desired, conventional phlegmatiser(s) may also be added before or during the preparation of the cyclic ketone peroxide.<br>
It is noted that the dialkyi peroxide of formula (II) and, if used, the conventional phlegmatiser, may be combined before use. Hence, in that case it is feasible to purchase and use specific dialkyi peroxides that contain one or more conventional phlegmatiser.<br>
The composition of the present invention may optionally contain certain additives as long as these additives do not significantly suppress the safety, transportability and/or storage stability of the composition. As examples of such additives are mentioned: antiozonants, antioxidants, antidegradants, UV stabilizers, coagents, fungicides, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, coupling agents, dispersing aids, blowing agents, lubricants, process oils, and mould-release agents. These additives may be employed in their usual amounts. If used, such additives are typically added to the cyclic ketone peroxide composition shortly before the composition is used in a polymerization or (co)polymer modification process.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of cyclic ketone peroxide compositions in (radical) polymerization processes, (co)polymer modification processes, such as controlled rheology polypropylene (CR-PP) processing, and other reactions involving peroxides, like the synthesis of certain chemicals. Compositions according to the present invention are pre-eminently suitable for polymerization or (co)poiymer modification processes that require increased or high pressure. As an example is mentioned the high-pressure polymerization &gt; process of ethylene to produce low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In the polymerization reactions, conventional additives can be used, such as chain transfer agents and the like.<br><br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Materials:<br>
-	Di(tert-butyl) peroxide-product (Trigonox® B) ex Akzo Nobel (Assay: 99 wt.%, Active Oxygen: 10.83 wt.%)<br>
