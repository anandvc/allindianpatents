The present invention relates to carbon black aggregate. More particularly, it relates to a carbon black aggregate having a surface hardness of at least 70 g and having a covering which is less susceptible to powdering or breakage during transportation or storage, or less likely to bring about environmental pollution during use, and which is excellent in dispersibility in a vehicle.<br>
Carbon black is industrially widely used as a pigment which imparts a black color to an ink, a coating material, a resin or the like, or as a reinforcing material for rubber represented by tires. Historically, carbon black started from soot made of pine smoke as disclosed in a literature written in the Kan age in China and was developed as one produced by a channel black method by Mc. Nutt in U.S.A in 1892 and as one prepared by a furnace method by Phillips in 1942. The yield of carbon black has remarkably been improved since then, and the technology for controlling the particle size or the structure length of particles has shown a remarkable progress.<br>
On the other hand, with respect to the form of carbon<br><br>
black, no adequate improvement has been made. The form of carbon black industrially employed is limited to a powder product, a tumbling granulation product or a flake product. Such a form has a problem such that, in the case of the powder product, dusting or environmental pollution is substantial, or the bulk density is so low that the transportation costs will be high. In the case of the tumbling granulation product, dusting can be reduced, but there is a problem that the dispersibility tends to be poor when it is used for an ink or a coating material. Namely, in the carbon black industry, it has been believed that reduction of the environmental pollution and improvement of the dispersibility are in an antinomic relation to each other.<br>
With respect to powdery pigments in general, there were some attempts in the past to improve the dispersibility in a vehicle. For example, JP-A-51-1530 or JP-A-52-103422 proposed to prepare a pigment having good dispersibility by dispersing a pigment, a resin, a plasticizer, etc., in a solvent, followed by freeze-drying. Further, JP-A-57-49664 proposed a method in which a water-soluble polymer is added to a pigment to obtain a slurry, and the slurry is spray-dried. However, these methods had drawbacks that the treating costs were h5.gh, and it was difficult to carry out treatment of a large amount on an industrial scale. Further, the effect for preventing scattering or dusting was not adequate.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
Further, JP-A-2-142858 or JP-A-3-193129 discloses one having the initial dispersibility improved by carbon black compression-granulated by a roller compactor. However, dusting during use was not sufficiently improved. Further, improvement to a high bulk density was not adequate either.<br>
JF-A-6-122111 discloses that a carbon black powder was charged into a closed molding container, and after reducing the pressure in the container, the pressure in the container was restored to atmospheric pressure to impart a specific shape to the carbon black. However, the pressure which can be exerted by reduced pressure was not higher than 1 atm at best, and the molded product of carbon black was very soft, and it was likely that edges of the molded product underwent breakage, or the molded product underwent powdering during transportation or storage. Thus, such a method was not adequately qualified for an industrial operation.<br>
The present inventors have conducted an extensive study in view of the above problems and, as a result, have found that by forming carbon black into a carbon black aggregate having a certain specific hardness or by forming carbon black into an aggregate wherein the hardness of the surface and the hardness of the interior are in a specific relation, powdering can be suppressed, and surprisingly, the dispersibility in a vehicle is rather improved, and the product can be made to be<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
suitable for use. Further, it has been found that by applying wrapping to such &amp; carbon black aggregate. It is possible to completely prevent environmental pollution during use.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a carbon black aggregate, such as herein described having a surface hardness of at least 70 g and having a covering, such as herein described.<br>
The reason is not clearly understood as to why the carbon black aggregate of the present invention has adequate hardness, dusting can be prevented, and it is not only suitable for handling but also excellent in the dispersibility in a vehicle. However, it is considered that air among carbon black particles is uniformly deaerated so that carbon black particles are aggregated uniformly without no substantial irregularity in density, so that the dispersibility in a vehicle is also improved.<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in detail. Carbon black aggregate<br>
The carbon black aggregate of the present invention is one having a surface hardness of at least 70 g. Preferably, the hardness of the surface is higher than the hardness of the interior. Here, the hardness is the value measured by a spring type hardness raster (SRORE A) as stipulated in ASTM D-2240.<br>
The hardness of the surface is the value obtained by measuring the surface of the carbon, black aggregate by<br><br>
-5-<br>
the above method. The hardness of the interior is the hardness of a portion which is at least 5 mm inside of the surface of the carbon black aggregate. The hardness of the interior can be obtained by cutting the carbon black aggregate and measuring the hardness of the cut surface by the above method.<br>
The position for measuring the hardness is not particularly limited, and measurement may be made at a position appropriate for measuring an average information of the aggregate. In a case where fluctuations are large, measurements may be made at a plurality of positions, and their mean value may be, taken. For example, in a case where the aggregate is a rectangular parallelepiped, the hardness values at the center positions of the respective six faces may be measured, and their mean value may be calculated, In a case where the aggregate is cylindrical, the hardness values at the center positions of the top and bottom two circular faces may be measured, and their mean value may be calculated. In the present invention, the carbon black aggregate is one wherein a plurality of primary particles of carbon black are aggregated, which has a volume sufficiently large so that the hardness can be measured by ASTM D-2240. Since conventional granulation product and flake product are much smaller than the aggregate of the present invention, the, hardness of those conventional product can not be measured by ASTM D-2240. Accordingly,<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
the aggregate of the present invention has a size sufficiently large so that behavior of the aggregate is quite different from those of conventional powder product, granulation product and flake product. Therefore, various problems attributable to conventional product could be solved.<br>
If the hardness of the carbon black aggregate is less than 70 g, powdering or breakage is likely to occur during handling of the aggregate, and the aggregate is susceptible to disintegration during transportation and thus has no adequate strength for use. The surface hardness of the carbon black aggregate is not particularly limited so long as it is at least 70 g, and it is preferably from 100 to 2,000,g, more preferably from 200 to 1,500 g, most preferably from 300 to 800 g. In this range, the dispersibility in a vehicle is particularly excellent, whereby it can easily be dispersed in a vehicle when it is used as a pigment for an ink or a coating material. When it is used for preparation of a rubber composition, it is mixed with a strong force by a Banbury mixer or the like, whereby the dispersibility scarcely becomes a problem, and a higher hardness may be acceptable without any problem. Thus, the hardness may suitably be selected depending upon the particular application.<br>
The carbon black aggregate of the present invention may be such that the hardness of the surface is higher than the hardness of the interior. More preferably, the<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
hardness of the surface is higher by from 1.05 to 1.50 times the hardness of. the interior. In a case where the hardness of the interior fluctuates, the hardness at a position of 5 mm inside from the surface shall be adopted.<br>
The carbon black to be used, is not particularly limited. For example, lamp black, acetylene black or furnace black may be used. Furnace black which is commonly used, can be made to have a small particle size and a small structure, and when used for various colored compositions, it provides excellent characteristics which are believed to be attributable to the characteristics of the functional groups at its surface. On the other hand, it has had a serious problem of powdering and dusting. Accordingly, application of the present invention to such furnace black has a substantial significance from the industrial viewpoint.<br>
The method for preparing the carbon black aggregate is not particularly limited. However, to obtain a carbon black aggregate having the optimum hardness, it is preferred to employ a method of placing carbon black in a slidable mold and aggregating it by pressing. The method for preparing the carbon black aggregate is not particularly limited so long as it is a method capable of producing an aggregate of which, the hardness of the interior is low and the hardness of the surface is high. However, the aggregate of the present invention can<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
readily be prepared, for example, by the following method. Namely, carbon black is filled in a slidable mold and pressed at a pressing rate of at least 0.1 kgf/cm2 every minute, preferably from 1 to 500 kgf/cm2 every minute to aggregate the carbon black, whereby the hardness of the surface will be high and the hardness of the interior will below, and thus the carbon black aggregate of the present invention can readily be obtained.<br>
As apparatus to be used for pressing, various press molding machines including a hydraulic press machine and an air cylinder press machine, may be employed.<br>
Here, the material of the slidable mold into which the carbon black is put, is not particularly limited, and molds made of various metals, ceramics and resins may be employed. The pressure for aggregating the carbon black is preferably exerted directly from the mold which is solid. For example, in a case where carbon black is pressed by a gas surrounding the carbon black, as in JP-A-6-122111, it,will be difficult to form the surface having adequate hardness as the carbon black aggregate of the present invention.<br>
The size of the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is not particularly limited, and it may be at such a level that the hardness can be measured by the method stipulated in ASTM D-2240. Particularly preferably, the aggregate is a block having a volume of<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
at least about 1 cc. If the volume of the aggregate is smaller than 1 cc, the aggregate itself tends to scatter, thus leading to environmental pollution, even if the aggregate has the prescribed hardness.<br>
The shape of the aggregate is not particularly-limited and may be an optional shape such as a rectangular parallelpiped, cubic, cylindrical or spherical shape, depending upon the particular purpose and particular mode of use.<br>
The carbon black aggregate may have perforations and/or recesses. Here, the shape and size of perforations are not particularly limited and may be suitably selected depending upon the particular purpose. Specifically, for example, for the purpose of connecting a plurality of carbon black aggregates by passing a connecting medium such as a string, a rope or a chain through perforations of the respective aggregates in order to prevent collapse of piled aggregates during transportation or storage, the perforations may be such that such a connecting medium can pass therethrough. On the other hand, for the purpose of readily disintegrating the aggregate to disperse it in a vehicle for e.g. an ink or a coating material by forming perforations, such , perforations may preferably be relatively large. Otherwise, by forming perforations or recesses, fine adjustment of the weight of the carbon black aggregate can be facilitated, In such a case, perforations may be<br><br>
-10-<br>
formed by a perforating means having a tubular blade, so that the amount of carbon black removed as perforations can easily be determined from the cross-sectional area of the tubular blade. Accordingly, by forming a necessary number of perforations, fine adjustment of the amount of carbon black can easily be carried out.<br>
The size and shape of the recesses are likewise not particularly limited, and the recesses are acceptable so long as they form dents. For example, it is effective to form a concave and a convex to a carbon black aggregate, so that the concave of one aggregate will fit the convex of another aggregate, so that when a plurality of aggregates are piled, collapse of the piled aggregates can effectively be prevented. By providing various different concaves and convcxes, they may be used as means to identify the types of carbon black.<br>
A method for providing such perforations or recesses is not particularly limited. For example, a carbon black aggregate of a certain specific shape may be engraved by e.g. a cutter, or when an aggregate is to be molded, a mold having a protrusion may be employed, so that a carbon black aggregate having a recess can be formed.<br>
Otherwise, a so-called cutting line may be formed as a recess to improve disintegration when the aggregate is put into a mixing tank, i.e. to improve the dispersibility of carbon black when it is mixed with a vehicle, to simplify the dispersing step, to save the<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
labor for weighing or to improve weighing efficiency. For example, by providing a trapezoidal regular concave/convex pattern, the carbon black aggregate can be made readily dividable into the respective blocks.<br>
By making the shape of the carbon black aggregate to be a spherical, cylindrical or octahedral or higher polyhedral shape, or a pentagonal or higher polygonal prism, the aggregate may be made to have an excellent rolling property, whereby its transportation will be easy. Especially when it is made to. have a shape of a regular hexagonal prism, it will be excellent in the rolling property, and at the same time it will be excellent in the stability when a number of such aggregates are piled. Further, various shapes may be selected so that the transportation or introduction into a hopper, a tank or the like will be facilitated. The carbon black aggregate of the present invention has adequate hardness. Accordingly, during usual handling, it will be free from a damage by cracking or breakage or free from environmental pollution due to rupture of the covering, even when tumbled, thrown or piled, and it can readily be formed into various desired shapes and can be maintained in such shapes. On the other hand, for preparation of various carbon black-containing compositions, the aggregate may be formed to have excellent properties so that it can readily be dispersed and mixed by a conventional mixing means, whereby the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
operation efficiency can be remarkably improved in all phases where carbon black is employed.<br>
Thus, with the carbon black aggregate of the present invention, an optional shape can be selected for use.<br>
Further, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention may be made to have a resin or other various additives incorporated in addition to carbon black. In such a case, the amount of such additives is usually at most 5 wt%, preferably at most 3 w,t%. The timing for such addition is not particularly limited. However, for example, when the, carbon black powder is put in a mold, followed by pressing, in the above-mentioned process, if the one having such additives incorporated, is subjected to pressing, the operation will be simple.<br>
The density of the carbon black aggregate (i.e. the value obtained by dividing the mass of the aggregate by the volume of the aggregate) is not particularly limited. However, particularly preferably, the density, s (g/cc) is within the following range; at least<br>
s = 8.190 x ln-3D - 3.824 x l0-3L, + 0.516 and at most<br>
s =3.265 * 10-3D - 3.334 x 10-3L + 1.173 more preferably, at least<br>
s = 8.686 x 10-3D - 4.031 x 10-3L + 0.543 and at most<br>
s =3.123 x 10-3D - 3.189 x 10-3L + 1.072<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
Within this range, the aggregate will be excellent in the handling efficiency and in the dispersibility at the time of preparing an ink, a coating material or the like, and the resulting coating material, ink or the like will be particularly excellent in blackness.<br>
In each of the above formulae, D is the arithmetic mean particle size (nm) of carbon black by an electron microscope, i.e- the value obtained by the following method.<br>
Namely, carbon black is put in chloroform and dispersed by application of supersonic waves of 200 KHz for 20 minutes, and then the dispersed sample is fixed on a supporting film. The film is photographed by a transmission electron microscope, and a particle size is calculated by the diameter on the photograph and the magnification of the photograph. This operation is carried out over about 1,500 times, and an arithmetic mean of such values is taken as the particle size.<br>
L is the DBP oil absorption (ml/100 g) as measured by the method in accordance with JIS K6221-1982. Carbon black aggregate having cracks formed<br>
In the present invention, it is particularly preferred to have cracks formed in the above aggregate. It is thereby possible to increase the contact area of the aggregate with a dispersing medium to facilitate the penetration and uniform distribution of the liquid component in the powder, when various colored<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
compositions are to be prepared, for example, when the powder component is dispersed in a liquid medium such as a liquid varnish or a molten rubber resin to be used for preparation of an ink or a coating material, and thus, the effect of the present invention is believed to be obtained. Namely, it is considered that the liquid component will penetrate from the cracks formed in the aggregate, or, although the aggregate maintains a certain shape by the covering, when put into the liquid component, the covering will break or mix with the liquid component, and the content i.e. the aggregate will disintegrate and disperse, thus contributing to improvement of the dispersibility.<br>
The degree of cracks can be defined by a particle size measured by" the following measuring method. Namely, 100 g of a molded powder product having cracks formed, is put on a sieve having a diameter of 200 mm and snaked for one minute while exerting an impact by a shaking machine in accordance with JIS K-6221. The results are plotted on a Rosin-Rammlar diagram, and the median diameter is taken as a mean particle size.<br>
The mean particle size thus measured, is preferably from 0.1 to 50 mm, more preferably from 0.2 to 30 mm. If the mean particle size is smaller than 0.1 mm, the effect of molding to prevent dusting tends to be lost, whereby dusting is likely, to occur. On the other hand, if the mean particle size exceeds 50 mm, it tends to take a long<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
time for a liquid component such as a varnish or a molten polymer to penetrate to the center portion of the aggregate, and consequently, it tends to be difficult to obtain high dispersibility. As is evident from the above method for measuring the degree of cracks, the cracks in the present invention include not only a case wherein in the covering, the aggregate is present as completely divided into a plurality, but also a case wherein so-called "cracking" is imparted to a unitary continuous body, and thus they correspond to cracks whereby the aggregate can be divided into a plurality of particles by the above measuring method.<br>
In the present invention, a method for imparting cracks is not particularly limited. It is possible to employ, for example, a method of imparting vibration to the aggregate, a method of forming cracks by pressing the aggregate, 6r a method of forming cracks by bending the aggregate. Covering<br>
In the present invention, the above-described carbon black aggregate is covered. The material of the covering is not particularly limited, so long as it is capable of covering the carbon black aggregate. However, it is preferred to cover the aggregate with a component which is free from any problem even when it is dissolved in or mixed with a solvent to be mixed with the aggregate, or a carbon black-containing composition such as an ink, a<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
coating material, a resin or a rubber, as the intended product. By selecting such a material, it is possible to mix the covered aggregate with other components without removing the covering, to prepare a carbon black-containing composition, whereby dusting can be completely suppressed. Here the "covering" means to cover the carbon black aggregate to seal it from outside to such an extent that scattering or dusting of carbon black can substantially be prevented, and it includes not only packaging by a sheet material, such as wrapping, shrink packaging or vacuum packing, but also a covering by coating, formed by coating a film-forming component such as a curable liquid material such as a resin composition. Typically, it is preferred -to use a resin film made of a polymer compound such as a resin, since it has strength and flexibility durable against a force exerted when cracks are imparted to the aggregate, it has solubility in a carbon black-containing composition such as an ink, a coating material, a resin or a rubber, and it is convenient for packaging. For example, for application to an ink, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (hereinafter referred to as EVA), ethylcellulose, a phenol resin, an alkyd resin, an acrylic resin, a polyamide resin, or a super low density polyethylene may, for example, be used. For application to a coating material, EVA, a polystyrene or a super low density , polyethylene may, for example, be mentioned. In the<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
field of a water-soluble ink or a water-soluble coating material, polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene oxide may, for example, be mentioned. For application to a resin, polystyrene, EVA or polyethylene may, for example, be mentioned. For application to a rubber, polyethylene or EVA may, for example, be mentioned. The material may suitably be selected depending upon the particular application.<br>
In order to use such a resin as a covering film, an additive may be incorporated up to predetermined amount, for example, in order to prevent blocking of the film by itself, an inorganic filler such as silica or talc may be incorporated as a blocking preventive agent in an amount of less than 5 wt%. Or, less than 1 wt% of a slip agent, less than 0.5 wt% of an antioxidant or less than 0.1 wt% of a neutralizing agent may also be incorporated. Further, a polymer soluble in an ink, a coating material, a resin or a rubber to be used, may be added as the case requires.<br>
The method for covering in the present invention is not particularly, limited and may, for example, be pillow type packaging such as vertical pillow type packaging or horizontal pillow type packaging, film packaging such as shrink packaging, vacuum packaging, stretch packaging, skin packaging or fold wrapping, box packaging such as overwrapping, carton packing or portion pack, blister packaging, or skin packer. Further, a coating film may<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
be formed on the surface of the carbon black aggregate by coating by means of e.g. a spray, an air doctor coater, a blade coater, a rod coater, a knife coater or an impregnation coater, and such a coating film is used as the covering. Preferably, a carbon black aggregate is formed and then covered by a method whereby a film will closely contact the aggregate so that there will be substantially no space between the aggregate and the packaging, such as shr-ink packaging, pillow type packaging, fold wrapping, vacuum packaging or coating. If cracks are imparted by the above-described physical force to the aggregate after covering the aggregate by such a method, the film helps the shape-maintaining property of the aggregate even after imparting cracks, whereby piling can be facilitated for transportation or storage. It is particularly preferred to form a covering which closely fits on the carbon black aggregate, by vacuum packaging, shrink packaging or coating with a curable liquid having a film-forming property among such methods, whereby deterioration in quality by e.g. oxidation from the surface of the molded product can be prevented, the strength can be improved, the handling efficiency can be improved, the costs for transportation and storage can be reduced, and formation of the covering can be facilitated. The method for coating is not particularly limited, but a coating means such as a spray, an air doctor coater, a blade coater, a rod<br><br>
-19-<br>
coater, a knife coater or an impregnation coater, may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Especially for the purpose of protecting the surface and maintaining the shape of the carbon-black aggregate, the aggregate may preliminarily be covered with a heat shrinkable material, followed by heating to closely contact the covering. Usually, however, the aggregate may be covered with a material which is not heat shrinkable. Depending upon the particular purpose, aggregate may be covered with a porous material or cloth. Formation of a covering by heat shrink packaging with a heat shrinkable material has merits such that close contact of the covering to the carbon black can be easily accomplished/ and the shape-maintaining property can be improved. On the other hand, fine pores will be formed in the covering for deaeration during heat shrinkage. Depending upon the particular application or mode of use, it is preferred to coat a liquid resin to cover these pores, to close these pores with a film or to provide a double packaging, to close the pores so as to substantially prevent leakage of carbon black with a view to completely preventing pollution.<br>
The degree of covering is not particularly limited and may suitably be selected depending upon the particular use, transportation or storage environment. For example, coverings by means of various film-forming resins, paper, etc. are typical. However, the covering<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
is not limited to such typical examples, and various materials, for example porous materials, may be employed, and it is not necessary to cover the entire surface of the aggregate. Likewise, it is not necessary that the covering is closely in contact with the aggregate. The thickness of the covering is not particularly limited, and it is usually from 5 to 500 µm. To cover with a Sheet material, the thickness is preferably from 10 to 50 µmr and to apply a coating with a curable material, the thickness is preferably from 50 to 100 µm. However, the thickness is not limited to such ranges, so long as the covering accomplishes the desired purpose.<br>
In the case of coating, the coating material may be dissolved in a solvent or heat-melted, so that a liquefied material may be used for coating, of the carbon, black aggregate.<br>
The packaging may not necessarily be hermetically sealed and may have an appropriate form depending upon the particular purpose, working environment, etc.<br>
Further, the above-described carbon black aggregates having a covering may further be packaged (hereinafter sometimes referred to as secondary packaging). For example, a plurality of packaged carbon black aggregates may be packaged in a unitary body, so that the transportation cost can substantially be reduced. Or, when a covering is applied to a carbon black aggregate by means of a soluble material which will be described<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
hereinafter, if this covering is stained with soil or dust, and if the aggregate is put into a mixing tank without removing this covering, the resulting carbon black-containing composition such as an ink or coating material, will contain such soil or dust. Accordingly, depending upon the application or mode of use, the secondary packaging is effective. The means, material, etc. for the secondary packaging are not particularly limited/ and common various packaging methods may be employed. Specifically, stretch packaging such as pallet stretch packaging or pallet shrink packaging, or shrink packaging, may be mentioned as a typical example.<br>
By covering the carbon black aggregate as described above, it is possible to prevent environment pollution by dusting which is otherwise likely to take place when carbon black is used. Namely, it is possible to completely screen a user from the carbon black, and it is possible to accomplish complete prevention of ambient pollution due to dusting during its use. In particular, by covering with a material soluble in or miscible with an ink, a coating material, a resin or a rubber as the intended carbon black-containing composition (hereinafter referred to as a "soluble material"), the covered aggregate may be put into a mixing tank without removing the covering, and carbon black as fine powder can be used without bringing about environmental pollution, and such is very desirable also from the viewpoint of operation<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
efficiency. Further, such is effective to prevent breakage of the carbon black aggregates during transportation.<br>
Here, "soluble" means substantially soluble, but is not limited to completely soluble to such an extent that no solid will remain, but may be such that a fine solid content may be contained, so long as the material can be uniformly mixed to such ,an extent, that no adverse effects will be given to the property of the desired carbon black-containing composition. Further, "miscible" means that the material is miscible to a uniform state on appearance.<br>
Further, handling efficiency during the<br>
transportation will thereby be improved. As the carbon black aggregate of the present invention has adequate strength, various means may be employed for covering it. The obtained covered carbon black aggregate has a further improved strength, so that it is free from breakaqe. The covering can readily be formed in close contact with the carbon black aggregate, and the thickness of the covering can also be optionally adjusted. Therefore, it is readily possible to improve the strength or the shock absorbing property by properly selecting the covering material, and it is possible to effectively prevent breakage of the carbon black aggregates during transportation.<br>
Further, the density of the carbon black portion is<br><br>
sufficiently high so that the transportation and storage costs can substantially be reduced, and deaeration among particles can sufficiently be carried out, so that the dispersibility in a vehicle is particularly excellent. For example, by a method of packing a powder in a bag, followed by deaeration, it is difficult to sufficiently withdraw air among particles and to bind carbon black particles to one another to such an extent to form a carbon black aggregate. Namely, during vacuuming, the vacuuming system tends to suction the powder, whereby air can not adequately be withdrawn. Further, by this method, pressing is carried out by atmospheric air, whereby no adequate volume reduction can be carried out/ and such is still inadequate to diminish the bulky state.<br>
r<br>
Further, even if the entire bag is subjected to pressing, no adequate pressure will be exerted to car.bon black, whereby it can hardly be made into an aggregate which maintains a specific shape. Accordingly, heretofore, there has been no carbon black molded product having a packaging, especially the one providing excellent properties. Whereas, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention can readily be produced by the above-described method.<br>
In the present invention, carbon black in the covering is in the form of a specific aggregater whereby the following problems can be solved. Namely, firstly, even if a packaging bag made of a soluble material is<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
used for packaging, and carbon black is mixed as packaged by the bag, if the carbon black is not formed into an aggregate of the present invention, when it is put in a container for preparation of e.g. an ink or a coating material so that the resin film will dissolve and the carbon black powder is released from the packaging bag, the powder itself has poor compatibility with the liquid, whereby the powder is likely to be dusted by stirring vanes or exhaust blowers provided in the production apparatus, thus leading to environmental pollution. Secondly, the carbon black powder has a low bulk density, and it is not suitable for transportation or storage when packaged with a resin film in an air-containing state. Thirdly, carbon black which is a fine powder containing air, is hardly dispersible in an ink, in a varnish for a coating material or in a molten resin or rubber. With the carbon black aggregate of the present invention, these problems have been solved.<br>

mixture of these resins, or the one having various additives incorporated, may be used. Covering with super low density polyethylene<br>
As a particularly preferred embodiment, the above-described carbon black aggregate covered with a specific polyethylene may be mentioned.<br>
Namely, the packaging is constituted by a<br>
polyethylene having a density of at most 0.900 g/cc, more preferably at most 0.880 g/cc. Polyethylene usually includes a high pressure method low density polyethylene, a high density polyethylene, a low density polyethylene and a straight chain low density polyethylene. The densities of these polyethylenes are from 0.91 to 0.93 g/cc in the case of the high pressure method low density polyethylene, from 0.94 to 0,97 g/cc in the case of the high density polyethylene, and from 0-91 to 0.93 g/cc in the case of the linear low density polyethylene. These conventional polyethyleneG have high crystallinity and are commonly used as containers for various reagents or food products. However, it has been found by the study of the present inventors that it is difficult to dissolve them in vehicles for inks or coating materials. On the other hand, the above-described specific super low density polyethylene is a polyethylene which has a further lower density than such conventional polyethylenes and one which has been made possible to produce on an industrial scale by developments of the<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
catalyst technology in recent years. Such a super low density polyethylene has merits such that the film transparency can be made high, the heat sealing temperature at the time of covering can be lowered , and the tensile strength can be increased. The present inventors have studied the solubility of this super low density polyethylene in various solvents and have surprisingly found that its solubility in an ink or a coating material is very high. According to the present invention, a pigment is covered with a film of such a super low density polyethylene, whereby it can be introduced into an oven for preparation of an ink or a coating material without necessity to peel off such a polyethylene covering, and thus it is possible to provide a pigment which is extremely effective for prevention of environmental pollution.<br>
Such a super low density polyethylene to be used in the present invention, can be prepared, for example, by means of a catalyst so-called a metallocene catalyst or a Kaminsky catalyst. With such a catalyst, the active sites for polymerization reaction are of a single, species, whereby as compared with conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts, it is easy to control the molecular weight of the polymer or the polymer structure such as branching. As a result, it has been made possible to synthesize a super low density polyethylene.<br>
A method for processing the polyethylene thus<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
obtained to form a film useful as a covering materials is not particularly limited. For example, an inflation molding or a T-die molding may, for example, be employed. Also, the thickness of the film is not particularly limited so long as it has adequate strength for packaging the pigment and for transportation, and it is common to use one having a thickness of from 10 to 100 µm.<br>
When the polyethylene is formed into film, an<br>
antiblocking agent, a slip agent, an antioxidant or a<br>
neutralizing agent may be incorporated, as the case<br>
requires.	<br>
If the above-described super low density polyethylene is used alone for covering, it is most soluble, and even at a low temperature, it will readily dissolve in various<br><br>
vehicles without a problem of reprecipitation. However,<br>
it may be used in combination with other covering <br>
material depending upon the particular purpose or mode of<br><br>
use. For example, it may be coextruded with a resin component comprising an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer as the main component to form a laminate, so that a shrinking property in a transverse direction is imparted so as to facilitate shrink packaging of the pigment, or EVA may be mixed with the super low density polyethylene to increase the melt tension during preparation of a film.<br>
To the covering or the secondary packaging, printing (inclusive of typing) may be applied to print any desired<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
indication. The covering material or the secondary packaging material may preliminarily he printed, and the carbon black aggregate may be covered by such a printed material. Otherwise, printing may be applied after the covering or the secondary packaging has been applied to the carbon black aggregate. For example, an ink jet printer, an ink roll/ a hot printer, an imprinting machine or a laser printer may, for example, be employed. A printed label may be pasted. The carbon black aggregate of the present invention has adequate strength, whereby printing or labeling is easy. For example, a color line, a brand name, a product type, a name of manufacturers, a weight of the content, a lot number, a bar code, an illustration, a logo, a color display or a mark may be indicated for commercial distribution.<br>
Further, it is also preferred to impart an identification of the product type to the carbon black aggregate of the present invention by changing the color of the covering material, by attaching a color band which is used for a paper bag for conventional carbon black, or by imparting a design pattern or irregularities to the covering. With respect to the above-described coloring material for printing or the material for identification of the product type such as a label, the material and the amount may suitably be selected depending upon the particular purpose of the carbon black, so that the inclusion will create no problem.<br><br>
- 40 -<br>
Further, the covering or the secondary packaging may have an opening function. The opening function means a function whereby the covering or the secondary packaging can be opened without using a tool such as a knife or cutter to take out carbon black from the covering or the secondary packaging. Specifically, there may be mentioned a system wherein as in the case of a cigarette packaging, an opening tape is inserted during packaging or covering, so that at the time of opening, the tape is pulled to open the covering or the packaging, a perforation system wherein a perforated film is used for covering or packaging, so that at the time of opening, the film is torn along the perforations, a notch system wherein a V notch is imparted to a film at the time of covering or packaging, so that at the time of opening, the film is torn along the V notch, a label system wherein at the time of opening, a label is pulled so that the film is torn and opened, or a tongue system wherein in pillow packaging, an extra tongue portion is retained in the longitudinal sealing portion, so that at the time of opening, the tongue portion is pulled for opening. For opening of shrink-packaging, the tape system, the label system or the perforation system is preferred. The position for the opening may be at any position so long as the carbon black aggregate can readily be taken out. However, in the label system, a side surface is preferred which is not influential to e.g. stacking.<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
The carbon black in the covering, as the carbon black aggregate of the present invention, may be an aggregate of carbon black alone, or the aggregate may be formed of carbon black preliminarily mixed with an organic compound. Here, typical examples of the organic compound include a monomer or its polymer, a surfactant and an oil. However, the organic compound is not limited to such specific examples. Especially, additives to a carbon black-containing composition such as a resin composition, a rubber composition, a coating material or an ink, may be preliminarily mixed thereto. The method for mixing such, additive components to carbon black is not particularly limited.<br>
For example, before conveying a starting material to a press machine, an organic solvent or the like may be sprayed and the starting material mixture may be stirred in a conveyer such as a screw conveyor. Further, in order to improve the stirring effect, an independent mixer (blade type or pin type mixer) may be provided in addition to the conveyor.<br>
However, it is not desirable that as in kneading of a rubber<br><br>
composition, the components are compressed by mixing and undergo a phase change from solid to liquid, since it will thereby be difficult to form a carbon black aggregate. The mixing ratio of the organic compound to carbon black is preferably such that the organic compound is at most 50 wt%, preferably at most 20 wt%, more preferably at most 10 wt%. If the amount of the organic compound is too much, especially when the organic compound is liquid, the mixture with carbon black tends to be liquid or clay-like, whereby it will be difficult to prepare a carbon black aggregate having a specific shape.<br><br>
-42-<br>
Covering of pigment<br>
Various pigments can be covered with the above-described polyethylene having a density of at most 0.900 g/cm3. The pigments are not particularly limited. For example, titanium oxide (R-form), titanium oxide (A-form), zinc white, zinc sulfide, lithopone, white lead, lead sulfate, basic lead sulfate, lamp black, acetylene black, carbon black, graphite, bone black, iron oxide lead, antimony lead, cadmium lead, molybdenum lead, silver vermillion, minium, copper subchloride, chrome yellow (reddish), chrome yellow (yellowish), cadmium yellow, zinc yellow, strontium yellow, barium yellow, litharge, ochre, yellow iron oxide, #y-hematite, amber, sienna, guinea green, chromium oxide, cobalt green, phthalocyanine green, iron blue, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, phthalocyanine blue zinc dust, aluminum powder, gold powder, barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, chalk, magnesium carbonate, gypsum, alumina white, kaolin clay, mica, talc, silica, diatomaceous earth, synthetic diamond, permanent red 4R, watching red, first yellow 10G, disazoyellow, bordeaux 10B, toluidine maroon, peacock blue, nylon powder, or polyethylene powder, may, for example, be used.<br>
Further, these pigments which have been post-treated with various oxidizing agents or surface treating agents, may also be used.<br>
In general, when particle size of a pigment is not more than 100 µm, dusting will be a serious problem. In the present invention, the particle size of the pigment<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
is not particularly limited, but the present invention is particularly effective for such a pigment having a particle size of not more than 100 µm, has a particle size whereby improvement of working environment by the present invention is remarkable.<br>
In the present invention, a press-molded product obtained by press-molding such a pigment, may also be used as the case requires. By packaging a molded pigment, handling of the packaged pigment will be easy, and the storage and transportation costs can be reduced. Further, depending upon the type and application of the pigment, the molded product is deaerated by press-molding, whereby wettability to a vehicle will be improved, and it will be readily dispersed. As a mold to be used for press-molding, mold made of any material may be employed so long as it has adequate strength durable against the pressure exerted at the time of molding. Specifically, a mold made of metal, ceramics or resin may, for example, be used.<br>
The size of the mold is not particularly limited. Practically, however, it is preferred to mold the pigment to have a size of at least 1 cc, preferably at lear.t 100 cc, followed by packaging. If the size is too small, handling tends to be inconvenient.<br>
The pressing machine which can be used for pressing, may be any press-molding machine so long as press-molding can be done, such as a hydraulic mechanical pressure<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
machine/ a hydraulic hand pressing machine, a mechanical pressing machine or an air cylinder type pressing machine.<br>
The shape of the mold is not particularly limited, and depending upon the desired shape of the molded product, it may be a columnar shape having a triangle or other polygonal cross-section, particularly a cubic or rectangular parallelepiped shape, which is advantageous from the viewpoint of handling of the mold, efficiency for packaging the resulting molded product of pigment and the handling efficiency of the packaged pigment.<br>
The pressure applied for press-molding is preferably from 2 to 500 kgf/cm2, more preferably from 5 to 400 kgf/cm2. Further, after packaging such a molded product by a polyethylene film, a supersonic wave or vibration may, for example, be applied to impart cracks to the molded product in the film, whereby the dispersibility of the pigment will be further improved.<br>
The method for packaging the pigment of the present invention is not particularly limited. As described in the foregoing, the pigment may preliminarily be molded to have a certain shape by such a means as pressing, and the molded product is intimately packaged by shrink packaging, vacuum packaging or the like. This is simple and an excellent mode whereby the resulting packaged pigment is easy for handling. Of course, a method other than this may be employed, such as a method wherein a<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
packaging bag is prepared by the above-mentioned polyethylene, and the pigment is packed in the bag.<br>
Further, together with the pigment, various additives, particularly powdery additives which have a problem of dusting and pollution, may be packaged. The packaging form in the present invention is not particularly limited, so long as it is capable of separating the pigment from the exterior to a desired degree and capable of preventing dusting and pollution.<br>
The above-described polyethylene film having a density of at most 0.900 g/cc is soluble in various solvents for inks or coating materials and can be used without any problem. Accordingly, by mixing the packaged pigment of the present invention with a solvent or with a solvent and a resin component, various ink compositions or coating material compositions can be prepared. EVA<br>
When the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is used for an ink, the following is preferred as the covering. Namely, the aggregate is packaged by an ink-soluble material containing at least an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (hereinafter referred to as "EVA").<br>
As EVA, the vinyl acetate content is preferably from 5 to 25 wt%, more preferably from 10 to 20 wt%. If the content of vinyl acetate is less than 5 wt%, EVA tends to hardly dissolve in an ink, such being not practical. On<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
the other hand, if the content of vinyl acetate exceeds 25 wt%, the film tends to hardly be processable, and the film tends to undergo blocking, whereby application to packaging of the base material for an ink tends to be difficult.<br>
The content of EVA in the ink-soluble material is not particularly limited, but it is preferably at least 60 wt%, particularly preferably at least 70 wt%. Within this range, the balance between the miscibilifcy with the solvent at the time of preparation of an ink composition and the properties as a covering material, is best.<br>
An ink-soluble material other than EVA is a substance which can be present in an ink composition without any problem and a substance miscible with or soluble in a vehicle of an ink. Specifically, a rosin resin such as gum rosin, wood rosin or tall oil rosin, a phenol resin such as a 100% phenol resin or a modified phenol resin, a modified alkyd resin such as a fatty acid-modified alkyd resin, a rosin-modified alkyd resin, a linseed oil-modified alkyd resin, a dehydrated castor oil-modified alkyd resin or a soybean oil-modified alkyd resin, a petroleum resin, a rosin-maleic acid resin, a cyclized rubber, casein, shellac, a rosin-modified maleic acid resin, nitrocellulose, a polyamide resin, a chlorinated polypropylene, a urethane rusin, an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin, a vinyl chloride resin, a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, a butyral resin, a vinylidene<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
chloride resin, or a polyolefin such as a low molecular weight polyethylene, a low density polyethylene, a high density polyethylene, a low molecular weight polyethylene homopolymer, a low molecular weight polyethylene/acrylic acid copolymer, a low molecular weight polyethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer or a low molecular weight polypropylene, may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
To the soluble material, various suitable additives may be incorporated, as the case requires. For example, as a blocking-preventive agent to prevent blocking of the film itself, less than 5 wt% of an inorganic filler such as silica or talc may be added. Otherwise, less than 1 wt% of a slip agent, less than 0.5 wt% of an antioxidant or less than 0.1 wt% of a neutralizing agent, may be added. Further, less than 40 wt% of an ink-soluble polymer such as ethylcellulose, may be added as the case requires.<br>
As additives, additives such as a dispersant, an antioxidant, an anti-drying agent, a viscosity-controlling agent, a color-adjusting- agent, a reactant, a wetting agent, a defearning agent, an anti-fungus agent, an anti skinning agent, a buckling agent, a color breakup preventing agent and an anti-offset agent such as starch, may, for example, be mentioned. The type and the amount of the additive to be used, may be suitably selected for use depending upon the particular application of the packaged product, such as an ink, a coating material, a<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
colored resin or a rubber. The form of such a pigment or an additive may be powdery, a dry tumbled granulated produce, a wet granulated product, a compressed product by e.g. a roll compactor, or a press-molded product. Especially, a molded product press-molded by a suitable molding pressure or deaeration, is suitable for use in the present invention, since it is less in dusting or environmental pollution as compared with a powdered product, and has a high bulk density and good dispersibility,<br>
AS a solid vehicle, gilsonite, polyethylene tetrafluoride ("Teflon", tradename), wax or polyethylene wax may be mentioned. The respective components such as a pigment, an additive and a vehicle, may be coated all at once or may be coated separately. Of course, a part of them may be coated as the case requires.<br>
The carbon black aggregate of the present invention as described above, can be suitably used for any application where carbon black can be used. Preparation of a rubber composition<br>

size as withdrawn from the mold used for molding, or the one disintegrated to a diameter of from 0.1 mm to 1 cm so that the size will be less than the size of the inlet of the kneading machine, may be introduced to the kneading machine. Even when a disintegrated product is used, it is possible to attain improvement of the dispersibility and a low hysteresis loss effect. Here, the disintegrating method is not particularly limited. For example, a shear pulverization type pulverizer such as a cutting mill, a rotary crusher or a shear roll mill, may be used, whereby the density of the particles during pulverization will not be increased, such being desirable.<br>
By properly selecting the covering material, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention can be dispersed in a vehicle without removing the covering, whereby as mentioned above, the working environment can be improved, and the working efficiency can be substantially improved. However, it is of course possible to use the aggregate by removing the covering. In such a case, the scope for selection of the covering material will be broadened, although the number of working steps may increase.<br>

Specifically, a conventional method may be employed for blending the above-described carbon black aggregate<br><br>
in a varnish as a vehicle. Further, the dispersing step is not particularly limited, and a conventional method may be employed, except that the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is used.<br>
The varnish (vehicle) to be used is not particularly limited, so long as it is useful for an ink. For example, as a varnish to be used for printing, a mixture of a rosin-modified phenol resin, an alkyd resin and drying oil, which is used for lithographic printing, may be mentioned. As a varnish to be used for relief printing, a mixture comprising a natural resin such as gilsonite or rosin, a synthetic resin such as a rosin-modified phenol resin, a maleic acid resin, a petroleum resin, an alkyd resin or ester gum, a vegetable oil such as linseed oil or tung oil, and a mineral oil such as an ink oil or a solvent oil, may be mentioned.

The pigment for an ink of the present invention can be used for the production of any one of these inks,<br>
A method for dispersing the carbon black aggregate of the present invention in a vehicle, is not particularly limited. It may be used in a size as taken out from the mold used for molding. Otherwise, it may be crushed to a diameter of from 0.1 mm to 1 cm so that the size will be smaller than the inlet of a kneader, and then put into the kneader for dispersing. The effect for improving blackness can be obtained even, when the crushed product is used.<br>
Here, the crushing method is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to use a shearing type crusher such as a cutting mill, a rotary crusher or a shearing roll mill, whereby the density of the particles will not be increased during crushing.<br>
Further, the pigment for an ink of the present invention can be dispersed into a vehicle without<br><br>
- 55 -<br>
removing the covering, by properly selecting the material of the covering, whereby the working environment can be improved, and the operation efficiency can substantially be improved, as mentioned above. However, the covering may, of course, be removed Cor use. In such a case, the scope of selection of the covering material will be broadened, although an operational step increases.<br>
For preparation of a water based ink by means of the pigment of the present invention, a conventional method for preparation of a water-based ink can be used without any particular change to prepare an ink. For example, as a varnish useful for a water based ink, an alkali soluble resin such as a rosin maleic acid resin, a styrene acrylic acid resin, a styrene maleic acid resin, a styrene methacrylic acid resin, an acrylic acid ester acrylic acid resin or a methacrylic acid ester acrylic acid resin, a hydrosol type resin such as a styrene maleic acid resin, a styrene acrylic acid resin, an a-methylstyrene acrylic resin, an acrylic acid ester acrylic acid resin or a methacrylic acid ester acrylic acid resin, an emulsion type resin such as a styrene resin, a styrene acrylic acid ester resin, an acrylic acid eater copolymer resin or a methacrylic acid ester copolymer resin, may be used.<br>

Such varnish, additives and pigments including carbon black may be dispersed in a particle size suitable for the particular application by means of a conventional dispersing machine such as a ball mill, a sand mill, an attriter, a basket mill or a roll mill, to obtain a water based ink.<br>
Further, in an application where inclusion of coarse particles must be avoided as in the case of an ink for ink jet, coarse particles may be removed by such a method as centrifugal separation after the preparation of the ink. Preparation of a resin composition<br>
The carbon black aggregate of the present invention, as described above, may be used to obtain a resin composition. Specifically, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is mixed with a resin component. The mixture is kneaded, as the case requires.

In the preparation of the resin composition, a master batch may preliminarily be prepared, or the resin composition may<br><br><br>
57<br>
be directly prepared by blending.<br>
The method for dispersing the carbon black aggregate of the present invention in the resin component is not particularly limited. It may be used in a size as taken out from the mold used for molding. Otherwise, it may be crushed to a diameter of from 0.1 mm to 1 cm so that the size will be smaller than the inlet of a kneader, and then put into the kneader for dispersing. The effect for improving blackness and gloss can be obtained even when the crushed product is used. Here, the crushing method is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to use a shearing type crusher such as a cutting mill, a rotary crusher or a shearing roll mill, whereby the density of the particles will not be increased during crushing.<br>
Further, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention can be dispersed in the vehicle without removing the covering, by properly selecting the material of the covering, whereby the working environment can be improved/ and the operation efficiency can be substantially improved, as mentioned above. However, the covering may, of course be removed for use. In such a case, the scope for selection of the covering material will be broadened, although an operational step increases.<br>
Further, in addition to the above carbon black aggregate and the resin component, calcium stearate, an iron stabilizer, an antioxidant and other additives may<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
be optionally added as the case requires.<br>
The blending proportions of these components are preferably such that, in the case of preparing a master batch, carbon black as the pigment is from 30 to 60 wt%, the additives are a few wt%, and the rest is the resin component. The master batch thus prepared may be added to a molten resin to bring the carbon black concentration to a few wt%. On the other hand, in a case where a resin composition is prepared by direct blending, it is preferred that the carbon black is from 0.1 to 5 wt%, the additives are a few wt%, and the rest is the resin component.<br>
As described above, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is used for preparation of a resin composition. The resin composition to which the present invention is applicable is not particularly limited, and the present invention can be applied to a conventional resin composition. For example, a colored resin, an electrophotographic tonor, a spinning material for artificial fibers or a sealing agent may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Here, "a colored resin" means a resin having carbon black added thereto to have a color other than the color of the resin itself imparted. The purpose may, for example, be to impart to the resin (1) a decorative effect for the purpose of improving a commercial value, (2) a protective effect against ultraviolet rays<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
utilizing the ultraviolet ray-absorbing function of the pigment, (.3) an antistatic effect utilizing the electrical conductivity or (4) a reinforcing effect.<br>
"The electrophotographic tonor" is a colorant which is used for a copying machine, a printer or a facsimile wherein an image is formed by electrophotography. The tonor comprises a thermoplastic binder resin, a colorant (carbon black) and a charge-controlling agent, and it is common to employ carbon black having an agglomerated particle size of from 5 to 20 µm. The binder resin constitutes about 80 wt% of the tonor component, and it is common to employ a polyethylene resin, a methacrylic acid resin or a copolymer thereof, a polyester or an epoxy type resin. Carbon black is usually added in an amount of about 10 wt%.<br>
"The spinning material for artificial fibers" means a spinning material to be used for coloring a stock solution in a method wherein a colorant is added to a spinning stock solution for artificial fibers (chemical fibers, synthetic fibers), and such a stock solution is subjected to spinning to obtain colored fibers. As the fibers, viscose rayon, acetate, acrylic fibers, nylon, polyester or polypropylene may, for example, be usually employed. Spinning is usually carried out by three methods i.e. melt spinning, wet spinning and dry spinning. The colorant is used in four forms i.e. a master powder, a paste, a master batch and a color<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
pellet. Recently, for the purpose of reducing pollution by carbon black, a master batch tends to be used in many-cases. With respect to the type of carbon black, carbon black of common use to medium class is used in many cases. The colored fibers may be used, for example, for working clothes, school uniforms, swimming suits, sport wears, cloth for umbrellas, socks, carpets, canvases and fishing nets.<br>
"The sealing agent" is one used for sealing of e.g. a window glass of an automobile or as an adhesive for steel plates.<br>
The above-described resin compositions are merely examples of the resin compositions to which the present invention can be applied. The resin compositions to which the present invention can be applied, are not limited to such examples but extend to cover a wide range. Preparation of a coating composition<br>
The above-described carbon black aggregate may be used as a pigment to prepare a coating composition. For the preparation of the coating material, a conventional method may be employed except that the above carbon black aggregate is used as the pigment. Specifically, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is mixed with a varnish and a resin component.<br>
The varnish (the vehicle) to be used here is not particularly limited so long as it is useful for a<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
coating material. For example, it may be drying oil, improved drying oil, a natural resin or bitumen for an oil based coating material. It may be shellac for an alcoholic coating material. It may ,be nitrocellulose, acetyl cellulose, an acrylic resin, a phenol formaldehyde resin or a resin modified phenol formaldehyde resin for a cellulose derivative coating material. It may be an oxidized oil-modified alkyd resin, a modified alkyd resin, a butyrated aminoalkyd resin, an aminoalkyd resin, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated rubber, a styrene-butadiene resin, a thermosetting acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, an unsaturated polyester, a polyisocyanate resin, silicone and an alkyd resin, or butyl titariate for a synthetic resin coating material. It may be polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene-butadiene or a polyacrylic compound for a synthetic emulsion paint. It may be a phenol aldehyde polycondensate, an etherified melamine resin or an amine-neutralized alkyd resin for a water-base baking paint. It may be a protein starch arginate polyvinyl alcohol or carboxymethyl cellulose for a water base coating material. Natural high grade phenol or a natural phenol aldehyde resin may be used for a Japanese lacquer.<br>
The solvent is also not particularly limited, and a conventional solvent may be used, such as toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or water. Further, various additives may be used.<br><br>
- 62 -<br>
The blending proportions of these components may be conventional. Specifically, it is common that the varnish (non-volatile component) is from 20 to 40 wt%, the additives are a few wt%, and carbon black is from 0.5 to 5 wt%.<br>
The coating material is also not particularly limited. For example, according to classification based on the main components of the coating films, it may, for example, be an oil paint, an oil enamel, a phenol resin coating material, a maleic acid resin coating material, an alkyd resin coating material, an aminoalkyd resin coating material, a urea resin coating material, an alcoholic coating material, a lacquer, a vinyl resin coating material, an acryl resin coating material, a polyester resin coating material, an epoxy resin coating material, a polyurethane resin coating material, a silicone resin coating material, an emulsion resin coating material or a water-soluble resin coating material.<br>
The application of the coating material thus obtained is not particularly limited. For example, it can be used as a back coat for a magnetic tape. In such a case, the carbon black is required to have properties such as electrical conductivity, light-shielding property and a property for imparting surface irregularities. The carbon black may suitably be selected depending upon the required properties. As the varnish, a urethane type<br><br>
- 63 -<br>
varnish may particularly preferably be used.<br>
The method for dispersing the carbon black aggregate of the present invention in the varnish, is not particularly limited.. It may be used in a size as taken out from the mold used for molding. Otherwise, it may be crushed to a diameter of from 0.1 mm to 1 cm so that the size will be smaller than the inlet of a kneader, and then put into the kneader for dispersing. The effect for improving blackness and gloss can be obtained even when the crushed product is used.<br>
Here, the crushing method is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to use a shearing type crusher such as a cutting mill, a rotary crusher or a shearing roll mill, whereby the density of the particles will not be increased during crushing.<br>
Further, the pigment for a coating material of the present invention can be dispersed in a vehicle without removing the covering, by properly selecting the material of the covering, whereby the working environment can be improved, and the operation efficiency can substantially be improved, as mentioned above. However, the covering may, of course, be removed for use. In such a case, the scope for selection of the covering material will be broadened, although an operational step increases.<br>
The mechanism for the improvement of the property such as blackness by the carbon black aggregate of the present invention, is not clearly understood, but the<br><br>
- 64 -<br>
following can be assumed. Namely, as a mechanism for dispersion of carbon black in a varnish, it is considered that "this is a substitution step from a solid-gas interface to a solid-liquid interface i.e. from an air-pigment interface to a pigment-dispersing medium interface, and in the resulting solid-liquid dispersion system, the interaction at the interface of the pigment and the dispersion medium and the nature of the solid surface of pigment plays the main role" ("Most Recent Pigment Application Technique", published by Kabushiki Kaisha CMC, p. 137 et seq.)• Accordingly, in the pigment for a coating material of the present invention, air among carbon black particles is deaerated by press molding, and the substitution from the solid-gas interface to the solid-liquid interface is believed to be facilitated. In any case, by using the pigment for a coating material of the present invention, it is possible to accomplish extremely outstanding effects such that handling efficiency of carbon black as the pigment is improved, the environmental pollution due to dusting during handling can be prevented, and the costs for storage and transportation can be reduced, and at the same time the dispersibility, blackness and gloss of the resulting coating material can be substantially improved.<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no<br><br>

means restricted to such specific Examples.<br>

electrical fret saw. One specimen was used for measurement of the hardness, and the other specimen was used for measuring the powdering ratio and the initial dispersibility and for preparation of an ink. (4) Measurement of hardness<br>
The hardnesses of the surface and the cut face (interior), of one of the equally divided specimens of the aggregate, were measured. As the hardness meter, a spring type hardness meter (HD-103N Model) manufactured by Kabushiki Kaisha Kamishima Seisakusho, was used. The top surface and the side surface of the aggregate were<br>
measured three times each, and the mean value of the six<br><br>
points was taken as the surface hardness. As a result, the surface hardness was 90 g. The hardness of the cut face (interior) was measured three times, and the mean value was taken as the interior hardness. The interior hardness was 61 g. (5) Measurement of the powdering ratio<br>
The powdering ratio was measured,by the following method.<br>
The carbon black aggregate was accurately weighed for 25 ± 0.01 g (W), and put into a sieve having a diameter of 200 mm with an opening of 1 mm, as stipulated in JIS K-6221. A receptacle and a cover were attached to this sieve, and the sieve was snaked by a shaking machine as stipulated in JIS K-6221 for 20 seconds while applying shocks. The receptacle was detached from the shaking<br><br>
- 70 -<br>
machine, and the weight of carbon black in the receptacle was accurately weighed to an accuracy of 0.01 g, and this was taken as the weight (WR) after shaking, whereupon the powdering ratio was calculated by the following formula. Powdering ratio (%) = (WR/W) x l00. WR = 5.30 g, and the powdering ratio was 21.2%. Slight powdering occurred, but it was in a no problematic quantity. (6) Measurement of the initial dispersibility of ink<br>
A method for measuring the ink screen residue as an index for the dispersibility of carbon black in the preparation of an ink, will be described below.<br>
Into an about 1.8 e stainless steel container (diameter: 11 cm, height: 18.5 cm), 480 g of REDUCTUS #220 {manufactured by Kyodo Sekiyu) and 120 9 of the carbon black aggregate, were added. A stirrer (four vanes, diameter of each vane: 4.5 cm) set in TK AUTO HOMOMIXER SL10A (manufactured by Tokushu Rika Kogyo) was inserted at 2 cm above the bottom of the stainless steel container. The stirrer was operated at 5000 rpm and stirring was carried out for 1 hour. 50 g of the mixture was sampled and subjected to filtration with a stainless steel screen of 325 mesh (opening: 46 µm). After the filtration, about 200 cc of light oil was sprinkled on the screen for washing. This screen was dried for 1 hour in a dryer set at 150°C Then, the screen was taken out from the dryer and cooled, and then the weight of the<br><br>
- 71 -<br>
screen was measured. The weight of the initial screen preliminarily measured, was subtracted from the measured value to obtain the weight (A g) of the carbon black remaining on the screen, whereupon the screen residue was calculated by the following formula.<br>
Ink screen residue (%) = (A x 600/(50 x 120)) x 10Q The ink screen residue was 0,3 wt%, thus indicating good dispersibility. (7) Preparation of a heat shrink package<br>
114 g of a carbon black aggregate was cut out from the above-mentioned carbon black aggregate and wrapped by a PE(B) film having a thickness of 30 µm formed by inflation molding, followed by heat-sealing at 180°C for 2 seconds. This carbon black aggregate enclosed in the film was introduced into a shrink tunnel (Model: "NS-450") manufactured by Nissan Kiko K.K. set at 150°C, and the carbon black aggregate was subjected to shrink packaging. The packaged carbon black aggregate was touched with a hand, whereby the hand was not stained. (8) Preparation of an ink<br>
380 g of varnish "MS-800" manufactured by Showa Varnish K.K., 20 g of varnish "F104" manufactured by Showa Varnish K.K. and 57 g of "No. 6 Solvent" manufactured by Nippon Sekiyu K.K. were weighed and put into a vessel (diameter: 11 cm, height: 18-5 cm). This varnish was stirred for 1 hour at 5000 rpm by a homomixer (Model: "TK AUTO HOMOMIXER SL-10A") manufactured by<br><br>
- 72 -<br>
Tokushu Rika Kogyo K.K. to obtain a varnish for commercial offset, ink. The vessel was heated to bring the temperature of the varnish to 80°C. 114 g of the above shrink-packaged carbon black aggregate was added to the varnish for commercial offset ink prepared as described above/ followed by stirring at 5000 rpm for 120 minutes to obtain an ink.<br>
At that time, no dusting of carbon black occurred.<br>
(9)	Kneading<br>
The ink thus obtained was kneaded by a roll mill {Model: "BR-500") manufactured by Asada Tekkosho K.K., whereupon the size of non-dispersed blocks as measured by a grined gauge was confirmed to be not larger than 10 µm. It was necessary to pass the ink through the roll mill four times until the size of the non-dispersed blocks<br>
became not larger than 10 µm. This ink was aged for one<br>
*•	<br>
week and then used as an ink for testing.<br>
(10)	Drawdown test<br>
0.6 cc of this aged ink was sampled and set in an offset printing machine manufactured by Toyp Seiki. K.K. Sheets of groundwood paper of A4 size were fed to this printing machine and printed. The ink was naturally dried, and then the printed surface was subjected to color difference measurement by a SM color computer manufactured by Suga Shikenki K.K. to determine the L value. As a result, the L value (lightness) was 27.6. The L value was equal to the ink {Comparative Example 7)<br><br>

EXAMPLE 17 (1) Preparation of a carbon black aggregate<br>
0.5 kg of carbon black "#2650" (particle size: 13 nm, DBP oil absorption: 78 cc/100 g carbon black, bulk density: 0.077 g/cc) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, was put into a carbon steel mold (inner<br><br>
- 83 -<br>
size: 150 mm x 150 mm, height; 360 ram) manufactured by Yuken K.K., and set in a hydraulic press manufactured by Vuken K.K. Press molding was carried out by applying a pressure of 22.2 kgf/cm2 to obtain a carbon black aggregate. The density of the obtained aggregate was measured and found to be 0.191 g/cc.<br>
(2)	Preparation of a heat shrink package<br>
Using PE(B), a polyethylene bag of 5 cm x 5 cm was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1.<br>
3 g of a carbon black, aggregate was cut out from the above carbon black aggregate and put into the above polyethylene bag, and the bag was sealed.<br>
(3)	Preparation of a coating material<br>
90 g of glass beads having a diameter of from 2 .5 to 3.5 mm, manufactured by Tokyo Glass K.K. were put into a mayonnaise bottle of 140 cc. Then, 16 g of a melamine alkyd resin varnish (Amylak 1026) manufactured by Kansai Paint K.K,, 10 g of Amylak Thinner manufactured by Kansai Paint K.K. and the above carbon black aggregate were put into the mayonnaise bottle.<br>
This mayonnaise bottle was set on a single type paint shaker "RC-5000A" manufactured by Red Devil Co. and shaked for 15 minutes. This black varnish was cooled to room temperature, and then the size of non-dispersed block carbon black within a range of from 0 to 50 µm was measured by a grined gauge (model: R1110) manufactured by Kabushiki Kaisha Kamishima Seisakusho. The result of<br><br>
- 84 -<br>
measurement by the grined gauge was 7 µm.<br>
Further, 50 g of "Amylak 3 026 Clear" was put into this mayonnaise bottle, followed by mixing for 10 minutes by the paint shaker to obtain a black coating material. (4) Evaluation of blackness<br>
A part of the black coating material was sampled (about 1 cc), and put on a PET film (Trancee G, thickness: 180 µm) manufactured by Fuji Film Co., Ltd. and stretched by a bar coater {No. 24) manufactured by Toyo Seiki K.K. This PET film was subjected to baking for 20 minutes in an air circulating dryer (Automatic Drying Oven SS-200N) manufactured by Ikeda Rika K.K. set at 120°C. The L value of the black coating film thus baked was measured by a color difference meter (Spectro Color Meter SE-2000) manufactured by Nippon Denshoku K.K. The L value was 4.22. This L value was equal to a coating material which was prepared by using powdery carbon black "#2650" which was not molded or packaged. EXAMPLE 18<br>
A coating material was prepared in the same manner as in Example 17 except that the packaging film in Example 17 was changed from PE(B) to PS manufactured by Oishi Sangyo K.K.<br>
The grined gauge value was 8 µm, and the L value of the coating film was 4.23. This L value was equal to a coating material which was prepared by using powdery carbon black "#2650" which was not molded or packaged.<br><br>
- 85 -<br>
The L value (lightness) of the coating film was in accordance with the Hunter's color difference described in JIS Z-8730-1980 (color difference representation method). COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
0.5 kg of carbon black "MA7" manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation was put into a stainless steel angular container (15 cm x 15 cm x 12 cm in height) and the upper surface was uniformly adjusted (height: 11.5 cm), and the angular container was set in a closed container having a cylindrical powder-receiving portion having a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 35 cm and having a suction port, a pressure-regaining port and a pressure meter at its upper portion. Then, the powder-receiving portion was closed, and the inner ait was aspirated from the suction port for 1 minute to reduce the inner pressure to a level of not higher than 1 mmHg. Then, the pressure-regaining port was opened to introduce air from the exterior, and the inner pressure was returned to atmospheric pressure in about 0.5 second.<br>
Thus, a carbon black aggregate was obtained in the form of a block having a length of 13.0 cm, a width of 12.8 cm and a height of about 7 cm. The top of the block was blown off by wind pressure and had substantial irregularities, A part of this aggregate was cut out, and the density was measured and found to be 0.321 g/cc. With respect to this block, the hardness and the<br><br>
- 86 -<br>
powdering ratio were measured by the same methods as in Example 1. The surface hardness was less than 56 g (less than the measurable lower limit), the interior hardness was 93 g, and the powdering ratio was 42.3 wt%, and the ink screen residue was 0.3 wt%. Thus, the powdering ratio was so high that it was not suitable for use.<br>
It was attempted to package this aggregate in the same manner as in Example 1, During the handling, the aggregate underwent breakage and powdering and polluted the environment.<br>
Using this packaged carbon black aggregated an ink<br>
was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1. During<br>
the preparation of the ink, dusting occurred. As a<br>
result of the drawdown test, the L value was 27.7. This<br>
value was substantially the same as in Examples 1, to 7..<br>

Using this packaged carbon black aggregate, an ink was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1. During the preparation of the ink, dusting occurred. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
Two sheets of 5 cm x 10 cm were cut out from the<br><br>
- 88 -<br>
PE(B) film. These two sheets were placed one on the other and the three sides were heat-sealed to obtain a bag. A few such EVA bags were prepared, and 114 g of carbon black "MA7" (particle size: 24 nm, DBP oil absorption: 65 cc/100 g carbon black, bulk density: 0.190 g/cc) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to be used as a pigment for ink, was put into each bag. The remaining side of each of EVA bag was heat-scaled to obtain a carbon black package having carbon black packaged by the EVA film. At the time of packaging the carbon black by the bag, the carbon black scattered and polluted the environment.<br>
While confirming the size of non-dispersed blocks in the prepared ink by means of a grined gauge, the ink was passed through a roll mill. AS a result, the number of times of passing the ink through the three-roll mill required to bring the size to not larger than 10 µm, was six times.<br>
Using this ink, printing was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, whereupon the L value on the printed surface was measured. The L value was 27.7. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
A commercial offset ink was prepared in the same manner as in Comparative Example 4 except that instead of "MA7", "MA7B" (bulk density: 0.384 g/cc) prepared by dry granulation of "MA7"/ was used. At the time of packaging the granulated carbon black, dusting occurred from the<br><br>
- 89 -<br>
carbon black. An ink was prepared in the same manner as in Comparative Example 4. The number of times of passing the ink through the roll mill required to bring the non-dispersed blocks to a size of not larger than 10 µm, was five times. During the preparation of the ink, no dusting was observed. The L value of the printed surface obtained by using this ink, was 27.5. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
An ink was prepared in the same manner as in Example 2 except that the "carbon black aggregate" (density; 0,598 g/cc) as made in Example 2, was used instead of the carbon black aggregate packaged in Example 2. During the preparation of the ink, the carbon black scattered and polluted the working environment.<br>
The ink was passed through the roll mill in the same manner as in Example 1, whereby the number of times of passing the ink through the roll mill required to bring the non-dispersed blocks to a size of not larger than 10 µm, was three times. Further, the L value of the printed surface was measured in the same manner as in Example 1, whereby the L value was 27.5. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7<br>
An ink was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the "carbon black MA7 powder" (bulk density: 0.190 g/cc) was used instead of the carbon black aggregate packaged in Example 1. During the preparation of the ink, the carbon black scattered and polluted the<br><br>

working environment.<br>
The ink was passed through the roll mill in the same manner as in Example 1, whereby the number of times of passing the ink through the roll mill required to bring the non-dispersed blocks to the size of not larger than 10 µm, was six times. Further, the L value of the printed surface was measured in the same manner as in Example 1, whereby the L value was 27.8.<br>
From the comparison between Examples 1 to 18 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7, it is evident that an ink or a coating material can be prepared without polluting the working environment by preparing an ink or a coating material by packaging a carbon black aggregate having a surface hardness of at least 70 g by a soluble film.

The bag did not break, and the outer appearance did not change. A sample was prepared in the same manner as in Example 22, and the screen residue and the particle size were measured. The ink screen residue was 2.5 wt%. Further, during the preparation of the ink, no environmental pollution was observed. The average particle size was 11.2 mm. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 14<br>
The ink screen residue was measured by the same method as in Example 22 except that carbon black "MA7" was used as enclosed in a bag made of the EVA film in a powder state. As a result, the ink screen residue was 4.0 wt%. Further, during the measurement of the ink screen residue, the EVA film ruptured, and a part of the carbon black scattered and polluted the environment. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 15<br>
The ink screen residue was measured in the same manner as in Example 22 except that no operation of imparting cracks was carried out. The environmental<br><br>

The same operation as in Example 29 was carried out except that carbon black powder "MA7" manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation was used instead of the carbon black aggregate used in Example 29. The value measured by the grined gauge was 8.0 µm, and the L value of the black coating material was 4.83.<br>
At the time of measuring the predetermined amount, the carbon black powder scattered around and polluted the environment. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 17<br>
The same operation as in Example 26 was carried out except that the carbon black aggregate was used without packaging.<br>
As a result, the number of times of passing the ink through the three roll mill required to bring the size of the non-dispersed blocks to a level of not larger than 10 µm was three times, and the size of the non-dispersed blocks was 7.5 ,µm. With the carbon black aggregate, dusting was substantially reduced as compared with the<br><br>
- 113 -<br>
starting material powder. However, as compared with the<br>
coated carbon black aggregates used in Examples 26 and<br>
27, prevention of the environmental pollution was not<br>
adequate.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 18<br>
The same operation as in Example 29 was carried out except that the carbon black aggregate was used without packaging.<br>
As a result, the blackness of the prepared coating material i.e. the L value by the color difference meter was 4.25.<br>
with the carbon black aggregate, dusting was substantially reduced as compared with the starting material powder. However, as compared with the packaged carbon black aggregate used in Example 29, prevention of the environmental pollution was not adequate. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 19<br>
The same operation as in Example 21 was carried out except that the carbon black aggregate was used without packaging.<br>
As a result, the loss factor at 60°C was 0.141, the heat build-up was 31.2°C, and D% was 99.1%. With the carbon black aggregate, dusting was substantially reduced as compared with the starting material powder. However, as compared with the packaged carbon black aggregate used in Example 21, prevention of the environmental pollution was not adequate.<br><br>
- 114 -<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 0<br>
The same operation as in Example 19 was carried out except that the carbon black aggregate was used without packaging.<br>
As a result, the dispersion index was 1,380. With the carbon black aggregate, dusting was substantially reduced as compared with the starting material powder. However, as compared with the packaged carbon black aggregate used in Example 19, prevention of the environmental pollution was not adequate.<br>
As shown in Examples 24 to 29, environmental pollution by carbon black can be prevented also by using various packaging methods by means of soluble materials-Effects of the _present invention<br>
The present invention provides a carbon black aggregate which undergoes no substantial powdering or breakage during transportation or storage and which is excellent in dispersibility when it is used for an ink or a coating material. The present invention is ,an epoch-making invention in that the carbon black aggregate of the present invention has a bulk density substantially improved as compared with the conventional granulated, products, whereby the costs for transportation and storage, which used to constitute a substantial proportion in the costs relating to carbon black, can be reduced to a large extent.<br>
By preparing an ink by means of the carbon black<br><br>
-115-<br>
aggregate of the present invention, it is possible to substantially reduce the treating time or the number of passing through the dispersing machine in the preparation of an ink, and the obtainable ink is not inferior in the basic ink performance (blackness and gloss) as compared with the one prepared by using a conventional product such as a powdery or granulated product.<br>
Further, when the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is used for preparing a coating material, the blackness of the coating material can be increased without requiring any special treatment or any expensive machine. When the carbon black aggregate of the present invention is used for preparation of a resin composition, it is possible to prepare a colored resin wherein the dispersibility of carbon black is high.<br>
A rubber composition prepared by using the carbon black aggregate of the present: invention, can show high dispersibility, a low loss factor and a low heat buildup. Besides, the balance of these physical properties can be control-led by adjusting the density of the carbon black aggregate.<br>
To obtain the carbon black aggregate of the present invention, no 3uch a large energy or a large apparatus as used to be required for granulation of carbon black by the conventional technique, is required. Namely, the carbon black aggregate of the present invention can be commonly used and can be produced by a relatively small<br><br>
- 116 -<br>
investment. Further, carbon black is in the form of an aggregate having a very small powdering ratio and further packaged, whereby pollution due to dusting can be substantially suppressed. Especially when it is packaged with a soluble material, pollution due to dusting can be reduced substantially to zero, whereby the working environment can be remarkably improved.<br><br>
