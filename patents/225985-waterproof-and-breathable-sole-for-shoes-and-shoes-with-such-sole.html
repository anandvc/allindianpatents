				<td>WATERPROOF AND BREATHABLE SOLE FOR SHOES, AND SHOE<br>
MANUFACTURED WITH SUCH SOLE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an improved waterproof and breathable<br>
sole for shoes and to the shoe manufactured with such sole.<br>
Background Art<br>
Waterproof and breathable soles made of plastics for shoes are already<br>
known.<br>
One of such soles is disclosed in WO 97/14326.<br>
In this case, the sole comprises:<br>
-- a mid-sole with a membrane made of a material that is impermeable to<br>
water and permeable to water vapor, associated with a lower protective layer<br>
of a material that is resistant to hydrolysis, water-repellent, breathable and/or<br>
perforated;<br>
-- a tread made of perforated elastomer, which is joined perimetrically and<br>
hermetically to the mid-sole.<br>
The waterproof and breathable sole disclosed in WO 98/51177 is also<br>
known; it comprises a preassembled insert in which there is a membrane that<br>
is impermeable to water and permeable to water vapor, associated with a<br>
lower protective layer made of a material that is resistant to hydrolysis,<br>
water-repellent, breathable and/or perforated.<br>
The insert is completed by an element that is overmolded or over-<br>
assembled, surrounds the membrane and the protective layer, and is joined<br>
hermetically to them.<br>
The insert is part of a mid-sole and is joined, together with said mid-sole,<br>
to a tread made of perforated plastic material, which is overmolded or over-<br>
assembled.<br>
In both cases, the protective layer arranged below the membrane is<br>
designed to protect it against piercing due to foreign objects that have<br>
accidentally passed through the holes.<br><br>
The protective layer is usually made of felt and is coupled to the membrane in a<br>
breathable manner (by means of spots of thermoplastic adhesive, for example of<br>
the polyurethane-based type) to allow the passage of the vapor from the inside<br>
of the shoe toward the outside through the holes provided in the tread.<br>
Breathable and waterproof soles for shoes are also known from USSN<br>
09/978,634 and EPA No. 01124210.4 and comprise, at least along part of their<br>
extension, a lower waterproof component that constitutes the tread, an upper<br>
component with a supporting structure that is provided with holes connected to<br>
outlets at least on the upper and edge surfaces, and a waterproof vapor-<br>
permeable membrane that surrounds externally at least the outward-facing<br>
regions of the upper component.<br>
The lower component, the upper component and the membrane are joined<br>
hermetically in the regions of possible internal water infiltration.<br>
Although the above described soles have now been available commercially for<br>
years and are unanimously acknowledged as being capable of producing an<br>
exchange of heat and water vapor between the microclimate inside the shoe and<br>
the external microclimate such soles in some cases, such as for example use on<br>
the part of users with quantitatively higher-than-average foot perspiration, have<br>
been found to have breathability that is insufficient to fully dispose of the<br>
generated vapor and ensure the correct microclimate inside the shoe.<br><br>
The structure of the above described soles in fact has, at least in a downward<br>
region, layer of microperforated plastic material, i.e., provided with holes having<br>
a diameter on the order of 1-2 millimeters, and the total area of the<br>
microperforations in any case limits the area of the membrane that is actually<br>
affected by the exchange of heat and vapor.<br>
WO0232246 discloses a mid-sole (11) for waterproof and breathable soles (10)<br>
for shoes, which comprises a waterproof and breathable membrane (13) and at<br>
least one lower layer(15) made of breathable elongation-preventing composite<br>
material, which is monolithically coupled to the peripheral region of the<br>
membrane (13) and in the corresponding region, to the tread (12) of the sole<br>
(10). The sole (10) is provided with a mid-sole (11).<br><br>
structure that is capable of utilizing to the maximum extent the breathability<br>
of the membrane that is impermeable to water and permeable to water vapor.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide a waterproof and<br>
breathable sole for shoes having a structure that allows to enlarge the area of<br>
the membrane until it affects substantially the entire sole of the foot.<br>
Another object is to provide a sole that does not entail particular<br>
constructive complications with respect to conventional soles.<br>
Another object is to provide a sole whose costs are competitive with<br>
respect to conventional types.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a waterproof and breathable sole for shoes<br>
having a structure that is characterized in that it comprises:<br>
--	a supporting layer which, at least in a preset macroportion, is made of<br>
net, felt or other diffusely perforated material;<br>
-- a membrane that is made of a material that is impermeable to water and<br>
permeable to water vapor and is associated above said supporting layer at<br>
least in said at least one preset macroportion made of net, felt or other<br>
diffusely perforated material, which it covers;<br>
--	a tread made of plastic material, with at least one through<br>
macroperforation at said at least one preset macroportion made of net, felt or<br>
other diffusely perforated material,<br>
said tread being joined hermetically to said membrane and to said<br>
supporting layer at least at the perimeter of said at least one macroportion<br>
made of net, felt or other diffusely perforated material.<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to Figures 1 to 4, a waterproof and breathable sole for<br>
shoes has, in a first embodiment, a structure that comprises a supporting<br>
layer 10 which is made of net, felt or other diffusely perforated material in<br>
preset macroportions 11.<br>
The supporting layer 10 constitutes, in this case, the assembly insole of<br>
the shoe.<br>
The term "macroportion" is used to reference portions of area preferably<br>
on the order of at least one square centimeter.<br>
In the other portions 12, the supporting layer 10 can be constituted by a<br>
fine mesh of synthetic material, leather or other commonly used materials.<br><br>
The structure also comprises a membrane 13, which is made of a material<br>
that is impermeable to water and permeable to water vapor (which is<br>
commonly commercially available and is made for example of expanded<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene), laminated onto a fine mesh 14 for supporting it,<br>
which lies above it, is made of synthetic material, and is arranged above the<br>
supporting layer 10 at at least the macroportions 11, which it covers.<br>
The membrane 13 can be made of airtight material or of air-permeable<br>
material.<br>
The membrane 13 can be coupled by means of spots of glue (not shown<br>
in the figures) to the supporting layer 10 in the regions of contact.<br>
A tread 15 made of plastic material has through macroperforations 16 at<br>
the macroportions 11 and is joined hermetically to the membrane 13 and to<br>
the supporting layer 10 at least at the perimeters of the macroportions 11.<br>
The through macroperforations 16 can be crossed by cross-members 16a,<br>
which prevent transverse deformations of the assembly by acting as tension<br>
members in the deformations that occur as a consequence of use.<br>
The coupling (Figures 1 and 2) can be provided for example by means of<br>
a perimetric layer 17 of adhesive, which is spread so as to penetrate, when<br>
the components are joined, through the meshes of the net and join<br>
monolithically the tread 15 and the membrane 13.<br>
As an alternative (Figures 3 and 4), it is possible to arrange between the<br>
supporting layer 10 and the membrane 13, or between the tread 15 and the<br>
supporting layer 10, a film 18 made of PVC or PU and then perform a high-<br>
frequency welding between the tread 15 and the membrane 13 by melting<br>
the film 18, with penetration thereof between me meshes of the net so as to<br>
join the components monolithically.<br>
As a further alternative, it is possible to perform high-frequency welding<br>
of the layer 10 and the membrane 13 to the film 18 and men glue the<br>
assembly to the tread 15.<br>
An inner sole, not shown in the figures, made of breathable or diffusely<br><br>
perforated material, for supporting the foot, can be arranged above the<br>
supporting layer 10 and the membrane 13 with the fine mesh 14.<br>
The described sole can be applied, in the commonly known ways, to an<br>
upper 20 of any kind so as to constitute a shoe 21.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, in a slightly different embodiment it is<br>
possible to provide a single macroportion 11 that affects the entire sole of<br>
the foot without portions 12, regardless of the arrangement of the through<br>
macroperforations 16 of the tread 15.<br>
In this case, the membrane 13 and its support 14 also affect the entire sole<br>
of the foot.<br>
The glue 17 or the film 18 are arranged perimetrically.<br>
With reference now to Figures 6 to 9, a waterproof and breathable sole<br>
for shoes according to a second embodiment has a structure that comprises a<br>
supporting layer 110 that is completely made of net, felt or other difnisely<br>
perforated material, which accordingly constitutes a single large<br>
macroportion 111.<br>
The sole again comprises a membrane 113 made of a material that is<br>
impermeable to water and permeable to water vapor (commonly<br>
commercially available and made for example of expanded<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene), laminated together with a fine mesh 114 for<br>
supporting it which lies above it, is made of synthetic material and is<br>
arranged above the supporting layer 110, which it covers completely.<br>
The membrane 113 can be made of airtight material or air-permeable<br>
material.<br>
The membrane 113 is preferably coupled by means of spots of glue to the<br>
supporting layer 110.<br>
It is possible to arrange a protective layer 110a, made for example of felt,<br>
below the membrane 113, for example if the supporting layer is made of net.<br>
A tread 115 made of plastic material is assembled to the supporting layer<br>
110 and is joined hermetically to me membrane 113 at least at the peripheral<br><br>
region of said membrane.<br>
The coupling can be provided by directly injecting the tread 115 onto the<br>
supporting layer 110 in a mold, with at least perimetric penetration through<br>
the meshes of the net or of the felt that is appropriately reduced in thickness<br>
at its perimeter, is perforated perimetrically or bordered with net so as to<br>
reach the membrane 113.<br>
The tread 115 is provided so as to form macroperforations 116, for<br>
example a single large through macroperforation 116 that affects<br>
substantially all the sole of the foot, except for the perimeter 115a, which is<br>
interrupted by protrusions 115b that form, together with the perimeter 115a,<br>
the surface for contact with the ground.<br>
The coupling between the tread 115 and the supporting layer 110 can be<br>
obtained also in the manners described in the first embodiment, i.e., by<br>
gluing or high-frequency welding.<br>
The sole can be coupled to an upper 120, so as to provide a shoe 121 that<br>
is assembled on an assembly insole 124 and is optionally coupled in a<br>
downward region to a filler layer 122 made of an expanded material such as<br>
diffusely perforated EVA, coconut fibers, etcetera.<br>
The layer 122, when it is made of diffusely perforated EVA or the like<br>
(therefore inherently waterproof but rendered air-permeable), can be used as .<br>
a means for the perimetric hermetic high-frequency welding from above of<br>
the membrane 113 to the upper 120.<br>
The subsequent gluing of the tread 115 need not necessarily be hermetic.<br>
The coupling between the sole and the upper 120 is in the peripheral<br>
region of said assembly insole and is provided for example by gluing or<br>
high-frequency welding.<br>
An inner sole 119 made of breathable or diffusely perforated material can<br>
be arranged above the assembly insole 124.<br>
The inner sole 119 can also be coupled in a downward region to a shock-<br>
absorbing layer 119a made of polyethylene or the like, which is diffusely<br><br>
perforated and anatomically contoured.<br>
Other layers, not shown, such as cleaning insoles, absorbent layers et<br>
cetera, can be provided.<br>
In practice it has been observed that the intended aim and objects of the<br>
present invention have been achieved.<br>
A waterproof and breathable sole for shoes has in fact been provided<br>
whose structure is capable of utilizing to the fullest extent the breathability<br>
of the waterproof vapor-permeable membrane.<br>
The structure allows to enlarge the area of the membrane until it affects<br>
substantially the entire sole of the foot.<br>
The manufacture of the sole does not entail particular constructive<br>
complications with respect to conventional soles.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications<br>
and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
All the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br>
In practice, the materials, so long as they are compatible with the<br>
contingent use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to<br>
requirements.<br>
