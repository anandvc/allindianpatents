PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a room temperature curable composition exhibiting, when cured, low permeability to gas(es).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Room temperature curable (RTC) compositions are well known for their use as sealants. In the manufacture of Insulating Glass Units (IGU), for example, panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with a gas or mixture oi gases oi low thermal conductivity, e.g. argon. Current room temperature curable silicone sealant compositions, while effective to some extent, still have only a limited ability to prevent the loss of insulating gas from the inner space of an IGU. Over time, the gas will escape reducing the thermal insulation effectiveness of the IGU to the vanishing point.<br>
The addition of clay materials to polymers is known in the art, however, incorporating clays into polymers may not provide a desirable improvement in the physical propertied particularly mechanical properties, of the polymer. This may be due, for example, to the lack of affinity between the clay and the polymer at the interface, or the boundary, between the clay and polymer within the material. The affinity between the clay and the polymer may improve the physical properties of the resulting nanocomposite by allowing the clay material to uniformly disperse throughout the polymer. The relatively large surface area of the clay, if uniformly dispersed, may provide more interfaces between the clay and polymer, and may subsequently improve the physical properties, by reducing the mobility of the polymer chains at these interfaces. By contrast, a lack of affinity between the clay and polymer may adversely affect the strength and uniformity of the composition by having pockets of clay concentrated, rather than uniformly dispersed, throughout the polymer. Affinity between clays and polymers is related to the fact that clays, by nature, are generally hydrophilic whereas polymers are generally hydrophobic.<br>
A need therefore exists for an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability compared to that of known RTC compositions. When employed as the sealant for an IGU, an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability will retain the intra- panel insulating gas for a longer period of time compared to that of a more permeable RTC composition and will therefore extend the insulating properties of the IGU over a longer period of time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery that curable silanol- terminated diorganopolysiloxane combined with filler of a certain type upon curing exhibits reduced permeability to gas. The composition is especially suitable for use as a sealant where high gas barrier properties together with the desired characteristics of softness, processability and elasticity are important performance criteria.<br>
2<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a curable composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
b)	at least one crosslinker for the silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane(s);<br>
c)	at least one catalyst for the crosslinking reaction;<br>
d)	a   gas   barrier   enhancing   amount  of  at  least   one   inorganic-organic nanocomposite; and, optionally,<br>
e)	at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the crosslinked diorganopolysiloxane(s).<br>
When used as a gas barrier, e.g., in the manufacture of an IGU, the foregoing composition reduces the loss of gas(es) thus providing a longer service life of the article in which it is employed.<br>

Fig. 2 is a graphic presentation of permeability data for the sealant compositions of Comparative Example 2 and Example 3.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graphic presentation of permeability data for the sealant compositions of Comparative Example 3 and Examples 4 and 5.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The curable sealant composition of the present invention is obtained by mixing a) at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane; b) at least one crosslinker for the silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane(s); c) at least one catalyst for the crosslinking reaction; d) a gas barrier enhancing amount of at least one inorganic-organic nanocomposite; and, optionally, e) at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the crosslinked diorganopolysiloxane(s), the composition following curing exhibiting low permeability to gas(es).<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful for the manufacture of sealants, coatings, adhesives, gaskets, and the like, and are particularly suitable for use in sealants intended for insulating glass units.<br>
When describing the invention, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay  platelets  separate  from  one  another  in  a  polymer  matrix.   During<br>
3<br><br>
exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>
The term "intercalant" as used herein includes any inorganic or organic compound capable of entering the clay gallery and bonding to its surface.<br>
The term "intercalate" as used herein designates a clay-chemical complex wherein the clay gallery spacing has increased due to the process of surface modification. Under the proper conditions of temperature and shear, an intercalate is capable of exfoliating in a resin matrix.<br>
As used herein, the term "intercalation" refers to a process for forming an intercalate.<br>
The expression "inorganic nanoparticulate" as used herein describes layered inorganic material, e.g., clay, with one or more dimensions, such as length, width or thickness, in the nanometer size range and which is capable of undergoing ion exchange.<br>
The expression "low permeability to gas(es)" as applied to the cured composition of this invention shall be understood to mean an argon permeability coefficient of not greater than about 900 barrers (1 barrer=10-10 (STP)/cm sec(cmHg)) measured in accordance with the constant pressure variable-volume method at a pressure of 100 psi and temperature of 25°C.<br>
The expression "modified clay" as used herein designates a clay material, e.g., nanoclay, which has been treated with any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
The term "nanoclay" as used herein describes clay materials that possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. Nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
As used herein, the term "nanoparticulate" refers to particle sizes, generally determined by diameter, less than about 1000 nm.<br>
As used herein, the term "platelets" refers to individual layers of the layered material.<br>
4<br><br>

Any swellable layered material that sufficiently sorbs the organic molecules to increase the interlayer spacing between adjacent phyllosilicate platelets to at least about 5 angstroms, or to at least about 10 angstroms, (when the phyllosilicate is measured dry) can be used in producing the inorganic-organic nanocomposite of the invention.<br>
The modified inorganic nanoparticulate of the invention is obtained by contacting quantities of layered inorganic particulate possessing exchangeable cation, e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Mg2+, with at least one ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane. The resulting modified particulate is inorganic-organic nanocomposite (d) possessing intercalated organopolysiloxane ammonium ions.<br>
The ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane must contain at least one ammonium group and can contain two or more amrnonium groups. The quaternary<br>

The layered inorganic nanoparticulate compositions of the present invention need not be converted to a proton exchange form. Typically, the intercalation of an organopolysiloxane ammonium ion into the layered inorganic nanoparticulate material is achieved by cation exchange using solvent and solvent-free processes. In the solvent-based process, the organopolysiloxane ammonium component is placed in a solvent that is inert toward polymerization or coupling reaction. Particularly suitable solvents are water or water-ethanol, water-acetone and like water-polar co-solvent systems. Upon removal of the solvent, the intercalated particulate concentrates are obtained. In the solvent-free process, a high shear blender is usually required to conduct the intercalation reaction. The inorganic-organic nanocomposite may be in a suspension, gel, paste or solid forms.<br>
A specific class of ammonium-containing organopolysiloxanes are those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,130,396 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein and can be prepared from known materials including those which are commercially available.<br>
The ammonium-containing organopolysiloxanes of U.S. Patent No. 5,130,396 is represented by the general formula:<br><br>
in which R1 and R2 are identical or different and represent a group of the formula:<br><br>
in which the nitrogen atoms in (I) are connected to the silicon atoms in (II) via the R5 groups and R5 represents an alkylene group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene group with 5 to 8 atoms or a unit of the general formula:<br><br>
in which n is a number from 1 to 6 and indicates the number of methylene groups in nitrogen position and m is a number from 0 to 6 and the free valences of the oxygen atoms bound to the silicon atom are saturated as in silica skeletons by silicon atoms of other groups of formula (II) and/or with the metal atoms of one or more of the cross- linking binding links<br>
8<br><br><br><br>
in which M is a silicon, titanium or zirconium atom and R' a linear or branched alkyl group with 1 to 5 carbon atoms and the ratio of the silicon atoms of the groups of formula (II) to the metal atoms in the binding links is 1 :0 to and in which R3 is equal to R1 or R2, or hydrogen, or a linear or branched alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 5 to 8 carbon atoms or is the benzyl group, and R4 is equal to hydrogen, or a linear or branched alkyl group with 1 to 20 carbon atoms or is a cycloalkyl, benzyl, alkyl, propargyl, chloroethyl, hydroxyethyl, or chloropropyl group consisting of 5 to 8 carbon atoms and X is an anion with the valence of x equal to 1 to 3 and selected from the group of halogenide, hypochlorite, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, carbonate, hydrogen carbonate, hydroxide, chlorate, perchlorate, chromate, dichromate, cyanide, cyanate, rhodanide, sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, selenide, telluride, borate, metaborate, azide, tetrafluoroborate, tetraphenylborate, hexafluorophosphate, formate, acetate, propionate, oxalate, trifluoroacetate, trichloroacetate or benzoate.<br>
The ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane compounds described herein are macroscopically spherical shaped particles with a diameter of 0.01 to 3.0 mm, a specific surface area of 0 to 1000 m2 /g, a specific pore volume of 0 to 5.0 ml/g, a bulk density of 50 to 1000 g/1 as well as a dry substance basis in relation to volume of 50 to 750 g/1.<br>
One method of preparing an ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane involves<br>
reacting a primary, secondary, or tertiary aminosilane possessing at least one<br>
hydrolysable alkoxy group, with water, optionally in the presence of a catalyst, to<br>
achieve hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of the silane and produce amine-<br>
terminated organopolysilane which is thereafter quaternized with a suitable<br>
quarternizing reactant such as a mineral acid and/or alkyl halide to provide the<br>
ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane. A method of this type is described in<br>
aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 5,130,396. In this connection, U.S. Patent No. 6,730,766, the<br>
entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein, describes processes for<br>
the manufacture of quaternized polysiloxane by the reaction of epoxy-functional<br>
polysiloxane.	<br>
In a variation of this method, the primary, secondary or tertiary aminosilane possessing hydrolysable alkoxy group(s) is quarternized prior to the hydrolysis condensation reactions providing the organopolysiloxane. For example, ammonium-containing   N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,   N,   N-trimethylammonium   chloride,   N-<br>
9<br><br>
trimethoxysilylpropyl-N, N, N-tri-n-butylammonium chloride, and commercially<br>
available	ammonium-containing	trialkoxysilane	octadecyldimethyl(3-<br>
trimethyloxysilylpropyl) ammonium chloride (available from Gelest, Inc.) following their hydrolysis/condensation will provide / ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane for use herein.<br>
Other suitable tertiary aminosilane useful for preparing ammonium- containing organopolysiloxane include tris(triethoxysilylpropyl)amine, tris(trimethoxysilyIpropyl)amine, tris(diethoxymethylsilylpropyl)amine, tris(tripropoxysilylpropyl)amine, tris(ethoxydimethylsiIylpropyl)amine, . tris(triethoxyphenylsiIylpropyl)amine, and the like.<br>
Still another method for preparing the ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane calls for quarternizing a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine- containing organopolysiloxane with quaternizing reactant. Useful amine-containing organopolysiloxanes include those of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 R6, and R7 each independently is H, hydrocarbyl of up to 30 carbon atoms, e.g., alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, etc., or R1 and R2 together or R6 and R7 together form a divalent bridging group of up to 12 carbon atoms, R3 and R5 each independently is a divalent hydrocarbon bridging group of up to 30 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms in the chain, e.g., straight or branched chain alkylene of from 1 to 8 carbons such as -CH2-, -CH2 CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2 CH2-, etc., each R4 independently is an alkl group, and n is from 1 to 20 and advantageously is from 6 to 12.<br>
These and similar amine-containing organopolysiloxanes can be obtained by known and conventional procedures e.g., by reacting an olefinic amine such as allyamine with a polydiorganosiloxane possessing Si-H bonds in the presence of a hydrosilation catalyst, such as, a platinum-containing hydrosilation catalyst as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,026,890, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Specific amine-containing organopolysiloxanes that are useful for preparing the ammonium-containing organopolysiloxanes herein include the commercial mixture of<br>
10<br><br><br>

The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 AND EXAMPLES 1-2<br>
Inorganic-organic nanocomposite was prepared by first placing 10 g of amino propyl terminated siloxane ("GAP l0/,siloxane length of 10, from GE Silicones, Waterford, USA) in a 100 ml single-necked round bottomed flask and adding 4 ml of methanol available from Merck. 2.2 ml of concentrated HC1 was added very slowly with stirring. The stirring was continued for 10 minutes. 900 ml of water was added to a 2000 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with condenser and overhead mechanical stirrer. 18 g of Cloisite Na+ (natural montmorillonite available from Southern Clay Products) clay was added to the water very slowly with stirring (stirring rate approximately 250 rpm). The ammonium chloride solution (prepared above) was then added very slowly to the clay-water mixture. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour and let stand overnight. The mixture was filtered through a Buckner runnel and the solid obtained was slurried with 800 ml of methanol, stirred for 20 minutes, and then the mixture was filtered. The solid was dried in oven at 8O0C for approximately 50 hours.<br>
To provide a 2.5 weight percent nanocomposite, 224.25g of OMCTS (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) and 5.75g of GAP 10 modified clay (inorganic-organic nanocomposite prepared above) were introduced into a three-necked round bottom flask fitted with overhead stirrer and condenser. The mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for 6 hours at ambient temperature. The temperature was increased to 175°C while stirring continued. 0.3g of CsOH in Iml of water was added in the reaction vessel through septum. After 15minutes, polymerization of OMCTS began and 0.5 ml of water was added with an additional 0.5 ml of water being added after 5 minutes. Heating and stirring were continued for lhour after which 0.1 ml of phosphoric acid was added for neutralization. The pH of the reaction mixture was determined after 30 minutes. Stirring and heating were continued for another 30 minutes and the pH of the reaction mixture was again determined to assure complete neutralization. Distillation of cyclics was carried out at 175°C and the mixture was thereafter cooled to room temperature.<br>
The same procedure was followed with 5 weight percent of GAP 10 modified clay.<br>
In-situ polymerization procedures were followed with 2.5 wt% and 5 wt% (see Table 1) GAP 10 modified clays (prepared above). The in-situ polymers with different amounts of clay were then used to make cured sheets as follows: In-situ silanol-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), (Silanol 5000, a silanol-terminated polydimethylsiloxane of 5000 cs nominal and Silanol 50,000, a silanol-terminated polydimethylsiloxane of 50,000 cs nominal, both available from Gelest, Inc.) GAP 10 modified clay formulations were mixed with NPS (n-propyl silicate, available from<br>

Gelest, Inc.) crosslinker and solubilized DBTO (solubilized dibutyl tin oxide, available from GE silicones, Waterford, USA) catalyst using a hand blender for 5-7 min with air bubbles being- removed by vacuum. The mixture was then poured into a Teflon sheet- forming mold and maintained for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25°C and 50% humidity). The partially cured sheets were removed from the mold after 24 hours and maintained at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 AND EXAMPLES 4 AND 5<br>
The inorganic-organic nanocomposite of Examples 4 and 5 was prepared by introducing 15 grams of octadecyldimethyl(3-trimethoxysilyl propyl)) ammonium chloride (available from Gelest, Inc.) into a 100ml beaker and slowly adding 50 ml of methanol (available from Merck). 30 grams of Cloisite 15A ("C- 15 A," a montmorillonite clay modified with 125 milliequivalants of dimethyl dehydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride per 100 g of clay available from Southern Clay Products) clay was added very slowly to a 5 liter beaker containing a water: methanol solution (1 :3 ratio, 3.5 L) and equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer which stirred the mixture at a rate of approximately 400 rpm. The stirring continued for 12 hours. The octadecyldimethyl(3-trimethoxysilyl propyl)) ammonium chloride (prepared above) was then added very slowly. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours. Thereafter, the mixture was filtered through a Buckner funnel and the solid obtained was slurried with a water: methanol (1:3) solution several times before being filtered again. The solid was dried in oven at 80 C° for approximately 50 hours.<br>
The above-indicated blends were then used to make cured sheets as follows: PDMS-silypropyl modified clay formulations were mixed with NPS and DBTO, as listed in Table 3, using a hand blender for 5-7 minutes with air bubbles being removed by vacuum. Each blend was poured into a Teflon sheet-forming mold and maintained for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25°C and 50% humidity) to partially cure the PDMS components. The partially cured sheets were removed from the mold after 24 hours and maintained at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>
