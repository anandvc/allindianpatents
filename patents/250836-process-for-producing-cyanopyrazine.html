				<td>1.         Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 2-cyanopyrazine by ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine employing a novel catalyst comprising of an active component consisting of metal oxides of molybdenum, chromium and antimony loaded on alumina.<br>
2.         Background of the Invention<br>
2-cyanopyrazine and their derivatives have acquired tremendous importance since they form the starting materials for a number of valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and anti-tubercular drugs.<br>
For catalyzing ammoxidation of an alkyl substituted heteroaromatic compounds such as alkylpyrazines, several catalysts comprising vanadium oxide have been used. However, conventional catalysts possess very strong catalytic activity rendering them unsuitable for the ammoxidation of alkylpyrazines. As a result of the strong catalytic activity of conventional catalysts, dealkylation or cleavage of the heteroaromatic ring occurs thereby resulting in low yields and selectivity of the desired nitriles.<br>
It is therefore, essential to develop a catalyst for the ammoxidation of alkyl substituted pyrazine compounds, which provides good yield and selectivity for the desired nitriles.<br>
Several processes are reported in the known arts for the catalytic ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine and their derivatives to their corresponding nitriles.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,931,561 to Shimizu, et al., discloses molybdenum-ceria oxide based catalyst for ammoxidation of alkylated pyrazines to corresponding nitriles, conversion and yields were reported to be approximately 30-40% at a temperature of 400°C, with mole ratios of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine: ammonia: air and steam # 1: 20: 10: 5. The lower conversion, yields and higher<br>
mole ratio of ammonia render this process unattractive and unsuitable from the industrial production point of view.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,786,478 to Lee, et al., discloses the ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine over molybdenum-phosphorus oxide based catalyst for production of cyanopyrazine. In this process quantity of byproducts formed was more such as pyrazinamide and others. It is the main disadvantage of this process.<br>
European Patent No.: 0253360 to Shimizu, et al., discloses the vanadium-phosporus oxide catalyst for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles. Production of 2-cyanopyrazine over above catalyst used mole ratios were 1: 25: 15: 2 for 2-methylpyrazine: ammonia: air and steam. Higher mole ratio of ammonia renders this process unattractive and unsuitable.<br>
Indian Patent No.: 178283 to Gupta, et al., discloses molybdenum-vanadium oxide catalyst for the production of 2-cyanopyrazine from 2-methylpyrazine over above-mentioned catalyst used mole ratios were 1:15-20:20-25:20 for 2-methylpyrazine: ammonia: air: water at a temperature of 350-400°C and obtained yield and selectivity was 60-70% and conversion was 93-98% respectively. Higher mole ratio of ammonia renders this process unattractive and unsuitable.<br>
European Patent No.: 0037123 to Isatsugu, et al., discloses ammoxidation of alkyl heteroaromatic compound over a catalyst comprising of vanadium, antimony and uranium or chromium oxides mixed with fine powdered alumina. The catalyst needs a calcination temparature of 800°C, rendering the process of catalyst preparation unattractive. The reference also recommends a very high mole ratio of air about 90 mole % per mole of alkyl substituted heteroaromatic compound. This is also another disadvantage since it results in very high uncondensable gaseous effluents.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to devise an improved process for producing 2-cyanopyrazine by the ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine, which ensures higher yield and selectivity at lower mole ratio of ammonia and obviates the formation of<br>
byproducts such as, pyrazine, pyrazinamide and pyrazine mono carboxylic acid, at the time of production.<br>
The invention disclosed herein demonstrates a better way of ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine to produce 2-cyanopyrazine by using a novel catalyst, which results in higher yield and selectivity and also prevent the formation of by product.<br>

Preferred embodiments are further illustrated in the following examples: Process for preparing of the Catalyst<br>
Example 1<br>
Oxalic acid 35 g was taken in 300 g of DM water in a SS vessel with a mechanical stirrer. Ammonia molybdate 68 g was added under stirring. Heating was slowly started and reached to 70-80°C, chromium trioxide 48 g was added and the mixture was heated to concentrate the solution till thick slurry was obtained. The<br>
support material 300 g in the form of 3-4 mm pellets was added to the above slurry under constant agitation and heating was continued. The coated thick mass obtained was carefully dried at 120-130°C for about 2-3 hrs. The dried mass was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500-550°C for about 5-6 hrs. The calcined mass was sieved to remove the powder and loosely held active material present on the support. If desired, repeated coatings can be carried out to ensure necessary percentage loading on the support material of the active ingredients. The coated mass thus obtained was between 15-20% by weight of the support. The molar ratio of the active material was 1:9 for molybdenum and chromium oxides.<br>
Example 2<br>
Oxalic acid 35 g was taken in 300 g of DM water in a SS vessel with a mechanical stirrer. Ammonia molybdate 68 g was added under stirring. Heating was slowly started and reached to 70-80°C, chromium trioxide 48 g was added and the mixture was heated to concentrate the solution till thick slurry was obtained. The support material 300 g in the form of 3-4 mm pellets was added to the above slurry under constant agitation and heating was continued. The coated thick mass obtained was carefully dried at 120-130°C for about 2-3 hrs. The dried mass was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500-550°C for about 5-6 hrs. The calcined mass was sieved to remove the powder and loosely held active material present on the support. If desired, repeated coatings can be carried out to ensure necessary percentage loading on the support material of the active ingredients. The coated mass thus obtained was between 10-15% by weight of the support. The molar ratio of the active material was 1:9 for molybdenum and chromium oxides.<br>
Example 3<br>
Oxalic acid 35 g was taken in 300 g of DM water in a SS vessel with a mechanical stirrer. Ammonia molybdate 68 g was added under stirring. Heating was slowly started and reached to 70-80°C, chromium trioxide 48 g was added and the mixture was heated to concentrate the solution till thick slurry was obtained. The support material 300 g in the form of 3-4 mm pellets was added to the above slurry under constant agitation and heating was continued. The coated thick mass obtained was carefully dried at 120-130°C for about 2-3 hrs. The dried mass was<br>
then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500-550°C for about 5-6 hrs. The calcined mass was sieved to remove the powder and loosely held active material present on the support. If desired, repeated coatings can be carried out to ensure necessary percentage loading on the support material of the active ingredients. The coated mass thus obtained was between 10-15% by weight of the support. The molar ratio of the active material was 9:1 for molybdenum and chromium oxides.<br>
Example 4<br>
The same procedure as in example 1 was followed by adding antimony pentoxide also to the example 1 catalyst and maintained molar ratio was 1:4: 9 for molybdenum : antimony : chromium.<br>
Example 5<br>
The same procedure as in example 1 was followed by adding antimony pentoxide also to the example 1 catalyst and maintained molar ratio was 1:8:18 for molybdenum : antimony : chromium.<br>
The catalysts prepared in the above mentioned examples were individually used in the preparation of 2-cyanopyrazine from 2-methylpyrazine and better results were obtained.<br>
The following procedure was adopted for evaluating the catalyst and optimizing the process parameters. 2-methylpyrazine was vaporized at 275-375 C in a preheater and the superheated vapors were allowed to pass over a catalyst bed maintained at a temperature in the range of 350-425°C. Ammonia and air are allowed to enter and mix with the 2-methylpyrazine above the catalyst bed.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a steel reactor with 1-meter length and 23 mm ID mounted in a vertical zone tubular furnace. Above the catalyst bed, packing of inert material such as porcelain or glass beads was placed to ensure proper distribution of the reactants. The reactor tube is heated and the temperature is maintained as per the requirement. The feeder line is provided with three attachments, first for air, second for ammonia and third for 2-methylpyrazine. The<br>
first zone of the reactor tube packed with inert acts as a vaporizer and super heater. Condenser traps and heater scrubbers are attached to the bottom outlet of the reactor in order to quench the product, as soon as they exit the catalyst bed. Temperature of these condensers is maintained below 10°C by the circulation of chilled brine.<br>
