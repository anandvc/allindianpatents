				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention is related to the field of organometal catalyst<br>
compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
By "consisting essentially of herein it is intended to mean that the<br>
process steps, substance or mixture of substances recited after this phrase does not<br>
include any further respective steps or components which would materially affect the<br>
functioning of the process or the properties of the substance or combination of<br>
substances produced by the process or recited after this phrase.<br>
The production of polymers is a multi-billion dollar business. This<br>
business produces billions of pounds of polymers each year. Millions of dollars have<br>
been spent on developing technologies that can add value to this business.<br>
One of these technologies is called metallocene catalyst technology.<br>
Metallocene catalysts have been known since about 1960. However, their low<br>
productivity did not allow them to be commercialized. About 1975, it was discovered<br>
that contacting one part water with two parts trimethylaluminum to form methyl<br>
aluminoxane, and then contacting such methyl aluminoxane with a metallocene<br>
compound, formed a metallocene catalyst that had greater activity. However, it was<br>
soon realized that large amounts of expensive methyl aluminoxane were needed to<br>
form an active metallocene catalyst. This has been a significant impediment to the<br>
commercialization of metallocene catalysts.<br>
Borate compounds have been use in place of large amounts of methyl<br>
aluminoxane. However, this is not satisfactory, since borate compounds are very<br>
sensitive to poisons and decomposition, and can also be very expensive.<br>
It should also be noted that having a heterogeneous catalyst is<br>
important. This is because heterogeneous catalysts are required for most modern<br>
commercial polymerization processes. Furthermore, heterogeneous catalysts can lead<br>
to the formation of substantially uniform polymer particles that have a high bulk<br>
density. These types of substantially uniformed particles are desirable because they<br>
improve the efficiency of polymer production and transportation. Efforts have been<br>
made to produce heterogeneous metallocene catalysts; however, these catalysts have<br>
not been entirely satisfactory.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the polymer industry to provide,an<br>
economic material to activate metallocenc catalysts, and there is also a need for<br>
efficient heterogeneous metallocenc catalysts. The inventors provide this invention to<br>
help solve these problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is desirable to provide a process that produces a catalyst composition<br>
that can be used to polymerize at least one monomer to produce a polymer.<br>

the polymer.<br>

general formula:<br>
(X1)(X2)(X3)(X4)M1<br>
In this formula, M1 is selected from the group consisting of titanium,<br>

organometallic groups, and substituted organometallic groups, as long as these groups<br>
do not substantially, and adversely, affect the polymerization activity of the catalyst<br>
composition.<br>
Suitable examples of aliphatic groups are hydrocarbyls, such as, for<br>
example, paraffins and olefins. Suitable examples of cyclic groups are cycloparaffins,<br>

See, for example, U.S. Patents 4,939,217; 5,210,352; 5,436,305; 5.401,817; 5,631,335,<br>
5,571,880; 5,191,132; 5,480,848; 5,399,636; 5,565,592; 5,347,026; 5,594,078;<br>
5,498,581; 5,496,781; 5,563,284; 5,554,795; 5,420,320; 5,451,649; 5,541,272;<br>
5,705,478; 5,631,203; 5,654,454; 5,705,579; and 5,668,230; the entire disclosures of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Specific examples of such organometal compounds are as follows:<br>
bis(cyclopentadienyl)hamiumdichloride;<br>
Organoaluminum compounds have the following general formula.<br>
In this formula, (X5) is a hydrocarbyl having from 1 to about 20 carbon<br>
atoms. Currently, it is preferred when (X5) is an alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms. However, it is most preferred when (X5) is selected from the group consisting<br>

chloro. However, it is most preferred when (X6) is chloro.<br>
hi this formula, "n" is a number from 1 to 3 inclusive. However, it is<br>
preferred when "n" is 3.<br>
Examples of such compounds are as follows:<br>
trimethylaluminum;<br>
triethylaluminum (TEA);<br>
tripropylaluminum;<br>
diethylaluminum ethoxidc;<br>
tributyialuminum;<br>
triisobutyiaiuminum hydride;<br>
triisobutylaluminum;<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride; and<br>
diethyialuminum chloride,<br>
Cuifrrently, TEA is preferred.<br>
The fluorided solid oxide compound comprises fluoride and a solid<br>
oxide compound. The solid oxide compound is selected from the group qonsisting of<br>
silica-titania and silica-zirconia. Silica is the majority component of the solid oxide<br>
compound.<br>
The titania content of the silica-titania generally ranges from about<br>
0.5% to about 30% by weight titanium, preferably, from about 2.5% to about 15% by<br>
weight titanium, and most preferably, from 4 to 10% by weight titanium.<br>
The zirconia content of the silica-zirconia generally ranges from about<br>
1% to about 40% by weight zirconium, preferably, from about 5% to about 30% by<br>
weight zirconium, and most preferably, from 8 to 20% by weight zirconium.<br>
The solid oxide compound should have a pore volume greater than<br>
about 0.5 cc/g, preferably greater than about 0.8 cc/g, and most preferably, greater than<br>
1 cc/g.<br>
The solid oxide compound should have a surface area from about 100<br>
mVg to about 1000 mVg, preferably from about 200 m2/g to about 800 m2/g, and most<br>
preferably, from 200 m2/g to 800 m2/g.<br>
The solid oxide compound can be made by any method known in the<br>
art. In a first method, the solid oxide compound can be made by cogellation of<br>
aqueous materials, as represented in U.S. Patents 3,887,494; 3,U9,569; 4,405,501;<br>
4,436,882; 4,436,883; 4,392,990; 4,081,407; 4,981,831; and 4,152,503; the entire<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In this procedure, a<br>
titanium or zirconium salt, such as titanyl sulfate, is dissolved in an acid, such as<br>
sulfuric acid, to which sodium silicate is added until gellation occurs at neutral pH.<br>
Aging for several hours at about pH 7 to 10 and at about 60 to about 90°C is followed<br>
by washing and drying. Drying may be accomplished by any means known in the art,<br>
such as, for example, azeotropic distillation, spray drying, flash drying, vacuum drying,<br>
and the like.<br>
In a second method, the solid oxide compound can be made by<br>
cogellation in an organic or anhydrous solution as represented by U.S. Patents<br>
4,301,034; 4,547,557; and 4,339,559; the entire disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. By these techniques, an organic silicate, such as, for<br>
example, tctracthyl orthosilicate, and an organic titanate or organic zirconate, such as,<br>
for example, titanium or zirconium tetraisopropoxide, is dissolved in an organic<br>
solution, such as, for example, an alcohol, to which a small amount of water is added<br>
along with an acid or base to cause hydrolysis and gellation of the solid oxide<br>
compound. The order of introduction of these ingredients can be varied, and the<br>
addition of each can be divided into stages to achieve special properties. Aging and<br>
drying often result in a high porosity solid oxide compound.<br>
In a third method, the solid oxide compound can be made by coating the<br>
surface of silica with a layer of titania or zirconia, as exemplified by U.S. Patents<br>
4,424,320; 4,405,768; 4,402,864; 4,382,022; 4,368,303; and 4,294,724; the entire<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Any technique known in<br>
the art can be used. One particularly common method is to treat a silica, which has<br>
been dried at about 200°C to remove adsorbed water, with an organic solution of a<br>
titanium or zirconium alkoxide, such as, for example, titanium isopropoxide, or a<br>
titanium or zirconium halide, such as, for example, titanium tetrachloride. Subsequent<br>
drying and calcining in air at high temperature converts the titanium or zirconium into<br>
titania or zirconia, which remains substantially dispersed. This reaction can also be<br>
accomplished in a gas phase if the titanium or zirconium compound is vaporized into a<br>
gas stream which is then allowed to contact the silica.<br>
Any method known in the art for fluoriding the solid oxide compound<br>
with a fluoride-containing compound can be used in this invention. One common way<br>
is to impregnate the solid oxide compound with an aqueous solution o.f a fluoride-<br>
containing salt, such as, for example, anmonium floride.(NH4F), ammonium<br>
bifluoride (NH4HF2), hydrofluoric acid (HF), ammonium silicofluoride ((NH4)SiF6),<br>
ammonium fluoroborale (NH4BF4), ammonium fluorophosphate (NH4PF6), fluoroboric<br>
acid (HBF4), and mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the fluoride-containing compound<br>
can be dissolved into an organic solvent, such as an alcohol, and used to impregnate<br>
the solid oxide compound to minimize shrinkage of pores during drying. Drying can<br>
be accomplished by any method known in the art such as vacuum drying, spray drying,<br>
flash drying, and the like.<br>
The fluoride-containing compound can also be incorporated into a gel<br>
by adding it to one of the aqueous materials before gellation. These aqueous materials<br>
were disclosed in the first and second methods for preparing solid oxide compounds<br>
discussed previously in this disclosure.<br>
The fluoride-containing compound can also be added to a sjurry<br>
containing a gel before drying. Formation of a gel was disclosed in the first and<br>
second methods for preparing solid oxide compounds discussed previously in this<br>
disclosure.<br>
The fluoride-containing compound can also be added during calcining.<br>
In this technique, the fluoride-containing compound is vaporized into a gas stream<br>
used to fluidize the solid oxide compound so that it is fluorided from the gas stream.<br>
In addition to some of the fluoride-containing compounds described above, volatile<br>
organic fluorides may be used at temperatures above their decomposition points, or at<br>
temperatures high enough to cause reaction. For example, perfluorohexane,<br>
perfiuorobenzene, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic anhydride,<br>
hcxafluoroacetylacetonate, and the like may be vaporized and contacted with the solid<br>
oxide compound at about 300 to about 600°C in air or nitrogen. Inorganic fluoride<br>
containing vapors may also be used, such as, for example, hydrogen fluoride or even<br>
elemental fluorine gas.<br>
The solid oxide compound can also be calcined at a temperature in a<br>
range of about 100 to about 900°C before being fluorided.<br>
. ju *\ The amount of fluoride present before calcining is about 2 to about 50%<br>
lby weight fluoride based on the weight of the fluorided solid oxide compound before<br>
calcining. Preferably, it is about 3 to about 25% by weight, and most preferably, it is 4<br>
 to 20% by weight fluoride based on the weight of the fluorided solid oxide compound<br>
 before calcining.<br>
It is important that the fluorided solid oxide compound be calcined.<br>
Generally, this calcining is conducted at a temperature in the range of about 200°C to<br>
about 900 °C, and for a time in the range of about 1 minute to about 100 hours.<br>
Preferably, the fluorided solid oxide compound is calcined at temperatures from about<br>
300°C to about 700°C and a time in the range of about 1 hour to about SO hours, most<br>
preferably, temperatures from 35O°C to 600°C and a time in the range of 3 to 20<br>
hours.<br>
Calcining can be completed in any suitable atmosphere. Generally, the<br>
calcining is completed in an inert atmosphere. Alternatively, the calcining can be<br>
4<br>
completed in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as, oxygen or air, or a reducing<br>
atmosphere, such as, hydrogen or carbon monoxide. Calcining can also be conducted<br>
in stages, for example, conducting the fluoriding in a gas phase at a lower temperature,<br>
then further calcining at a higher temperature. Alternatively, calcining can be<br>
conducted first in an oxidizing atmosphere, then in a reducing atmosphere at a<br>
different temperature, or vice-versa.<br>
Optionally, a small amount of chloride can be included in or after<br>
the calcining treatment to achieve higher activity in some cases, or to increase<br>
the contribution of the titanium or zirconium.<br>
The catalyst compositions of this invention can be produced by<br>
contacting the organometal compound, the organoaluminum compound, and the<br>
fiuorided solid oxide compound, together. This contacting can occur in a variety of<br>
ways, such as, for example, blending. Furthermore, each of these compounds can be<br>
fed into a reactor separately, or various combinations of these compounds can be<br>
contacted together before being further contacted in the reactor, or all three compounds<br>
can be contacted together before being introduced into the reactor.<br>
Currently, one method is to first contact the organometal compound and<br>
the fiuorided solid oxide compound together, for about 1 minute to about 24 hours,<br>
preferably, 1 minute to 1 hour, at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C,<br>
preferably 15°C to 80°C, to form a first mixture, and then contact this first mixture<br>
with an organoaluminum compound to form the catalyst composition.<br>
Another method is to precontact the organometal compound, the<br>
organoaluminum compound, and the fiuorided solid oxide compound before injection<br>
into a polymerization reactor for about 1 minute to about 24 hours, preferably, I<br>
minute to 1 hour, at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C, preferably 20°C<br>
to 80°C.<br>
A weight ratio of organoaluminum compound to the fluorided solid<br>
oxide compound in the catalyst composition ranges from about 5:1 to about 1.1000,<br>
preferably, from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and most preferably, from 1:1 to 1:50.<br>
A weight ratio of the fluorided solid oxide compound to the<br>
organomQtal compound in the catalyst composition ranges from about 10,000:1 to<br>
about 1:1, preferably, from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and most preferably, from<br>
250:1 to 20:1, The ratios are based on the amount of the components combined to give<br>
the catalyst composition.<br>
After contacting, the catalyst composition comprises a post-contacted<br>
organometal compound, a post-contacted organoaluminum compound, and a post-<br>
contacted fluorided solid oxide compound. It should be noted that the post-contacted<br>
fluorided solid oxide compound is the majority, by weight, of the catalyst composition.<br>
Often times, specific components of a catalyst are not known, therefore, for this<br>
invention, the catalyst composition is described as comprising post-contacted<br>
compounds.<br>
A weight ratio of the post-contacted organoaluminum compound to the<br>
post-contacted fluorided solid oxide compound in the catalyst composition ranges from<br>
about 5:1 to about 1:1000, preferably, from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and most<br>
preferably, from 1:1 to 1:50.<br>
A weight ratio of the post-contacted fluorided solid oxide compound to<br>
the post-contacted organometal compound in the catalyst composition ranges from<br>
about 10,000:1 to about 1:1, preferably, from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and most<br>
preferably, from 250:1 to 20:1<br>
The catalyst composition of this invention has an activity greater than a<br>
catalyst composition that uses the same organometal compound, and the same<br>
organoaluminum compound, but uses silica or titania that has been impregnated with<br>
fluoride as shown in comparative examples 4 and 5. This activity is measured under<br>
slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the diluent, and with a<br>
polymerization temperature of about 50 to about 150°C, and an ethylene pressure of<br>
about 400 to about 800 psig. The reactor should have substantially no indication of any<br>
wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling.<br>
However, it is preferred if the activity is greater than about 1000 grams<br>
of polymer per gram of fluorided solid oxide compound per hour, more preferably<br>
greater than 2000, and most preferably greater than 2,500. This activity is measured<br>
under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as a diluent, and with a<br>
polymerization temperature of90°C, and an ethylcne pressure of 550 psig. The reactor<br>
should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of<br>
fouling.<br>
One of the important aspects of this invention is that no aluminoxane<br>
needs to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. Aluminoxane k an<br>
expensive compound that greatly increases polymer production costs. This also means<br>
that no water is needed to help form such aluminoxanes. This is beneficial because<br>
water can sometimes kill a polymerization process. Additionally, it should be noted<br>
that no borate compounds need to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. In<br>
summary, this means that the catalyst composition, which is heterogenous, and which<br>
can be used for polymerizing monomers or monomers and one or more comonomers,<br>
can be easily and inexpensively produced because of the absence of any aluminoxane<br>
compounds or borate compounds. Additionally, no organoehromium compound needs<br>
to be added, nor any MgCb needs to be added to form the invention. Although<br>
aluminoxane, borate compounds, organoehromium compounds, or MgCh are not<br>
needed in the preferred embodiments, these compounds can be used in other<br>
embodiments of this invention.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, a process comprising<br>
contacting at least one monomer and the catalyst composition to produce at least one<br>
polymer is provided. The term "polymer" as used in this disclosure includes<br>
homopolymers and copolymers. The catalyst composition can be used to polymerize<br>
at least one monomer to produce a homopolymer or a copolymer. Usually,<br>
homopolymers are comprised of monomer residues, having 2 to about 20 carbon atoms<br>
per molecule, preferably 2 to about 10 carbon atoms per molecule. Currently, it is<br>
preferred when at least one monomer is selected from the group consisting of ethylene,<br>
propylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentcne, 4-methyl-l-<br>
pentene, 1-hexene, 3-ethyI-l-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, I-decenc, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
When a homopolymer is desired, it is most preferred to polymerize<br>
ethylcne or propylene. When a copoiymer is desired, the copolymer comprises<br>
monomer residues and one or more comonomcr residues, each having from about 2 to<br>
about 20 carbon atoms per molecule. Suitable comonomers include, but are not<br>
limited to, aliphatic l-olefms having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, such as,<br>
for example, propylene, l-butene,"l-pcntene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, l-hexene, 1-octene,<br>
and other olefms and conjugated or nonconjugatcd dioleflns such as 1,3-butadiene,<br>
isoprene, piperylene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,7-hexadiene, and<br>
other such diolefins and mixtures thereof. When a copolymer is desired, it is preferred<br>
to polymerize ethylene and at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting<br>
of 1-butene, 1-pentene, l-hexene, 1-octene, and 1-decene. The amount of comonomer<br>
introduced into a reactor zone to produce a copolymer is generally from about 0.01 to<br>
about 10 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and<br>
comonomer, preferably, about 0.01 to about 5, and most preferably, 0.1 to 4.<br>
Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations, by<br>
weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
Processes that can polymerize at least one monomer to produce a<br>
polymer are known in the art, such as, for example, slurry polymerization, gas phase<br>
polymerization, and solution polymerization. It is preferred to perform a slurry<br>
polymerization in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization<br>
are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction<br>
conditions. The term "diluent" as used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an<br>
inert material; it is possible that a diluent can contribute to polymerization. Suitable<br>
hydrocarbons include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane,<br>
propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Furthermore, it is most<br>
preferred to use isobutane as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of such<br>
technology can be found in U.S. Patents 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280;<br>
and 5,597,892; the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The catalyst compositions used in this process produce good quality<br>
polymer particles without substantially fouling the reactor. When the catalyst<br>
composition is to be used in a loop reactor zone under slurry polymerization<br>
conditions, it is preferred when the particle size of the solid oxide compound is in the<br>
range of about 10 to about 1000 microns, preferably about 25 to about 500 microns,<br>
and most preferably, 50 to 200 microns, for best control during polymerization.<br>
In a specific embodiment of this invention, a process is provided to<br>
produce a catalyst composition, the process comprising (optionally, "consisting<br>
essentially of, or "consisting of):<br>
(1) contacting a solid oxide compound with water containing ammonium<br>
bifluoride to produce a fluofided solid oxide compound;<br>
wherein the solid oxide compound is selected from the group<br>
consisting of silica-titania and silica-zirconia;<br>
(2) calcining the fluorided solid oxide compound at a temperature within a<br>
range of 350 to 600°C to produce a calcined composition having 4 to 20<br>
weight percent fluoride based on the weight of the fluorided solid oxide<br>
compound before calcining;<br>
(3) combining the calcined composition and bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)<br>
zirconium dichloride at a temperature within the range of 15°C to 80°C<br>
to produce a mixture; and<br>
(4) after between I minute and 1 hour, combining the mixture and<br>
triethylaluminum to produce the catalyst composition.<br>
Hydrogen can be used in this invention in a polymerization process to<br>
control polymer molecular weight.<br>
One of the features of this invention is that the fluorided solid oxide<br>
compound activates the organometal compound much more efficiently than silica,<br>
silica-titania, or silica-zirconia alone. Thus, the titania or zirconia contributes to the<br>
activation of the organometal compound. A second feature of this invention is that the<br>
titania or zirconia is a weak polymerization catalyst in its own right, providing a high<br>
molecular weight component onto an otherwise symmetrical molecular weight<br>
distribution of the polymer produced by the organometal compound. This high<br>
molecular weight component, or skewed molecular weight distribution, imparts higher<br>
melt strength and shear response to the polymer than could be obtained from typical<br>
organometal compounds. These polymers may vary in molecular weight distribution<br>
depending on the organometal compound used and the relative contribution of the<br>
titanium or zirconium. One special feature of this invention, therefore, is that<br>
polydispersities of about 2.5 to about 4.0 and HLMI/MI values from about 25 to about<br>
50 can be produced from organometal compounds that would otherwise give<br>
polydispersities of about 2.1 to about 2.5 and HLMI/MI values less than about 20.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various<br>
articles, such as, for example, household containers and utensils, film products,<br>
drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form<br>
these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order<br>
to provide desired effects. It is believed that by using the invention described<br>
herein, articles can be produced at a lower cost, while maintaining most, if not<br>
all, of the unique properties of polymers produced with organometal:<br>
compounds.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Test Methods<br>
A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution<br>
Instrument" was used to determined the surface area and pore volume of the supports.<br>
This instrument was acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N. Y.<br>
Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc)<br>
on a compression molded sample, cooled at about 15°C per hour, and conditioned for<br>
about 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM<br>
D1928, Procedure C.<br>
High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 mins) was determined in accordance<br>
with ASTM D123 8 at 190°C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>
Melt index (MI, g/10 mins) was determined in accordance with ASTM<br>
D1238 at I90°C with a 2,160 gram weight.<br>
Description of Polymerizations Runs<br>
Polymerization runs were made in a 2.2 liter steel reactor equipped with<br>
a marine stirrer running at 400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The reactor was<br>
surrounded by a steel jacket containing boiling methanol with a connection to a steel<br>
condenser. The boiling point of the meihanoi was controlled by varying nitrogen<br>
pressure applied to the condenser and jacket, which permitted precise temperature<br>
control to within half a degree centigrade, with the help of electronic control<br>
instruments.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, first a small amount (0.01 to 0.10 grams<br>
normally) of an oxide compound or the inventive fluorided solid oxide compound was<br>
charged under nitrogen to a dry reactor. Next, two milliliters of an organometal<br>
compound solution containing 0.5 grams of an organometal compound (usually bis(n-<br>
butlycyclopentadicnyl) zirconium dichloride) per 100 miiliiiters of toluene was added<br>
by syringe. Then, 1.2 liters of isobutane liquid were charged to a reactor, and the<br>
reactor heated up to 90°C. One millilher or two miiliiiters to TEA as a 15 weight % (1<br>
molar) solution in heptane or ethyl aluminum dichloride (EADC) as a 25 weight %<br>
(1.5 molar) solution in heptane was added midway during the isobutane addition.<br>
Finally, ethylene was added to the reactor to equal a fixed pressure, normally 550 psig,<br>
which was maintained during the experiment. The stirring was allowed to continue for<br>
the specified time, usually around one hour, and the activity was noted by recording the<br>
flow of ethylene into the reactor to maintain pressure.<br>
After the allotted time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor<br>
slowly depressurized and opened to recover a granular polymer. In all cases, the<br>
reactor was clean with no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of<br>
fouling. The polymer was then removed and weighed.<br>
Comparative Examples 1 &amp; 2 (No Oxide Compound)<br>
This example demonstrates that an organometal compound solution<br>
added to a reactor with an organoaluminum compound but with no oxide compound<br>
does not provide any activity. A polymerization run was made as described<br>
previously. First, 2 miiliiiters of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride<br>
solution (0.5 grams of bis(n-butylcylopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride per 100 ml of<br>
toluene) were added. Then, half of the one liter of isobutane was added followed by 2<br>
miiliiiters of 15% by weight TEA in Example 1 or 2 miiliiiters of 25% ethylaluminum<br>
dichloride (EADC) in Example 2. The other half of the isobutane was added, and<br>
finally, ethylene was added. No activity was observed. After one hour of stirring, the<br>
reactor was depressurized and opened, but in each case, no polymer was found. These<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 3 (Silica)<br>
This example demonstrates the use of silica as an activator for an<br>
i<br>
organometal compound when used with an organoaluminum compound.<br>
Silica was obtained from W.R. Grace, grade 952, having a pore volume<br>
of about 1.6 cc/g and a surface area of about 300 square meters per gram. About 10<br>
grams of the silica were placed in a 1.75 inch quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz<br>
disk at the bottom. While the silica was supported on the disk, dry air was blown up<br>
through the disk at the linear rate of about 1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet per hour. An<br>
electric furnace around the quartz tube was then turned on, and the temperature was<br>
raised at the rate of 400°C per hour to a temperature of 600°C. At this temperature, the<br>
silica was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air to produce a calcined silica.<br>
Afterward, the silica was collected and stored under dry nitrogen. It did not have any<br>
exposure to the atmosphere.<br>
The calcined silica was then added to the reactor, followed by an<br>
organometal compound solution and TEA solution as described previously. These<br>
runs are shown in Table 1, which lists the amount of calcined silica charged, the run<br>
time in minutes, and the amount of polymer produced. The calcined silica produced<br>
almost no polymer.<br>
Comparative Example 4 (Fluorided Silica)<br>
A 50 gram sample of grade 952 silica described previously was<br>
impregnated with 100 milliliters of an aqueous solution containing 5 grams of<br>
dissolved ammonium bifluoride to produce a fluorided silica. This gave the sample a<br>
wet sand consistency which was then dried under half an atmosphere of vacuum at<br>
1 IO°C overnight. Then, the fluorided silica was calcined in dry air at 600°C by the<br>
procedures described in Example 3. The fluorided silica had a surface area of about<br>
192 square meters per gram and a pore volume of about 1.29 cc/g.<br>
A small sample of this fluorided silica was then tested as an activator<br>
for an organometal compound and an organoaluminum compound in a polymerization<br>
experiment. As shown in Table 1, it provided no activity.<br>
Comparative Example 5 (Fluorided Titania)<br>
A 5 gram sample of Aerosil titania was obtained from Degussa, Inc. and<br>
calcined in dry air at 600°C for three hours as described in Example 3. During this<br>
calcining, one milliliter of perfluorohexane was injected into a gas stream upstream<br>
from the titania bed. As the perfluororhexane vapor rose into the 600°C bed, it<br>
decomposed, thus laying down fluoride onto the surface of the titania. This produced a<br>
fluorided titania.<br>
A small sample of this fluorided titania was then tested as an activator<br>
for an organometal compound in a polymerization experiment. As shown in Table I, it<br>
provided almost no activity.<br>
Comparative Example 6 (Silica-Titanial<br>
A silica-titania was prepared by cogellation as described in Deitz, U.S.<br>
Patent 3,887,494. Titanyl sulfate was dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid, to which<br>
a sodium silicate solution was added slowly with vigorous stirring. When the pH<br>
reached about 6, the mixture gelled into a homogenous clear mass. This was then aged<br>
at 80°C at pH 7 for three hours, then washed nine times with water and two times in<br>
1% by weight ammonium nitrate. This gel was then azeotropically dried in ethyl<br>
acetate to produce a silica-titania. The silica-titania contained about 8% titanium and<br>
had a surface area of about 450 square meters per gram and pore volume of about 2.0<br>
cc/g. A 10 gram sample of the silica-titania was then calcined at 600°C for three hours<br>
in fluidizing dry air. Afterward, a small sample of the siiica-titania was tested for<br>
polymerization activity with an organometal compound solution. As shown in Table<br>
1, it exhibited no appreciable activity.<br>
Inventive Example 7 (Fluorided Silica-Titania Calcined at 600°C)<br>
A sample of 8.51 grams of the silica-titania from Example 6 was<br>
calcined by fluidizing in dry air at 600°C for three hours. Then, it was impregnated<br>
with 35 milliliters of a solution made by dissolving 2.50 grams of ammonium<br>
bifluoride in 100 milliliters of methanol. This brought the silica-titania to incipient<br>
wetness and constituted an equivalent of about 3.9 millimoles of fluoride per gram to<br>
produce a fluorided silica-titania. The methanol was then evaporated off, and the<br>
fluorided silica-titania was again calcined in air at 600°C for three hours as described<br>
above.<br>
Then, 0.1166 grams of the fluorided silica-titania were first charged<br>
under nitrogen to a dry reactor. Next, two milliliters of an organometal compound<br>
solution containing 0.5 grams of bis(n-butlycyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride per<br>
100 milliliters of toluene was added by syringe. Then, 1.2 liters of isobutane liquid<br>
was charged, and the reactor brought up to 90°C. One milliliter of 15% TEA was<br>
added midway during the isobutane addition. Finally, ethylene was added to the<br>
reactor to equal 550 psig pressure which was maintained during the experiment. The<br>
stirring was allowed to continue for one hour, and the activity was noted by recording<br>
the flow of ethylene into the reactor to maintain pressure.<br>
After the allotted time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor<br>
slowly depressurized and opened to recover a granular polymer. The reactor was clean<br>
with no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling. The polymer<br>
was removed and weighed yielding 137.5 grams. Thus, the activity was found to be<br>
1164 grams of polymer produced per gram of fluorided silica-titania charged per hour.<br>
The data are shown in Table I.<br>
The polymer had a broader molecular weight distribution than polymers<br>
produced by typical organometal compounds. It had a melt index of 0.04 g/10 min and<br>
a high load melt index of 1.72 g/10 min, giving a shear ratio of 42.5, which is higher<br>
than the usual 16-17 ratio obtained from typical organometal compounds. The number<br>
average molecular weiglrt was found to be 66,000, and the weight average was<br>
178,000, giving a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 2.7. These data are shown in Table 2.<br>
Inventive Examples 8 &amp; 9 (Fluorided Silica-Titania Calcined at 450°Q<br>
Another sample of the fluorided silica-titania described in<br>
Example 7 was calcined at 450°C instead of 600°C. It too was tested in a<br>
polymerization run, and the activity was found to increase to 1834 grams of<br>
polymer obtained per gram of fluorided silica-titania charged per hour (Table 1,<br>
Example 8).<br>
This fluorided silica-titania that was calcined at 450°C was tested<br>
again, except that it was allowed to react with the TEA and the organometal compound<br>
at 90°C in a reactor for 20 minutes before ethylene was added. This step increased the<br>
measured activity to 2837 grams polymer per gram of fluorided silica-titania per hour<br>
(Table 1, Example 9).<br>
Comparative Examples 10 &amp; 11 ( Silica-Zirconia)<br>
A silica-zirconia was prepared by the following procedure. A silica<br>
obtained from W.R.Grace as grade 952 was obtained having a surface area of about<br>
300 square meters per gram and a pore volume of about 1.6 cc/g. A 26.3 gram sample<br>
of silica was dried for three hours at 200°C in fluidizing nitrogen. Afterward, 50<br>
millilitcrs of a heptane solution containing 11.72 grams of zirconium propoxide were<br>
added to the sample. The heptane was then evaporated under nitrogen at 60 degrees C<br>
until the sample was dry to produce a silica-zirconia. It was then calcined in air at<br>
600°C for three hours. In two tests, the polymerization activity of this silica-zirconia<br>
was found to produce 35 and 78 grams of polymer per gram of silica-zirconia per hour.<br>
Inventive Example 12 (Fluorided Silica-Zirconia')<br>
The sihca-zirconia used in Examples 10 and 11 was then fluorided by<br>
the following procedure. 14.3 grams of the silica-zirconia, which had already been<br>
calcined at 600°C, were saturated with an aqueous solution containing 0.82 grams of<br>
ammonium bifluoride, which yielded a fluorided silica-zirconia having a wet sand<br>
consistency. The fluorided silica-zirconia was dried under vacuum at 120°C overnight,<br>
then calcined in dry air at 500°C for three hours before being tested for activity. The<br>
activity increased to 465 grams of polymer produced per gram of silica-zirconia per<br>
hour.<br>
Comparative Example 13 (Silica-Zirconia)<br>
A silica-zirconia containing 10 weight percent zirconium was prepared<br>
by anhydrous gellation as detailed by the following procedure. One mole (about 200<br>
mis) of tetraethyl orthosilicate was added to 500 milliliters of n-propanol. One<br>
milliliter of sulfuric acid was then added along with 30 milliliters of water, which is<br>
about 85% of the amount required for complete hydrolysis. This solution was stirred<br>
for thirty minutes to allow for reaction. It warmed slightly, indicating that hydrolysis<br>
was taking place. Then, 71 milliliters of zirconium propoxide were added, but no<br>
precipitation of zirconia took place, indicating that substantially all of the water had<br>
been consumed by reaction with the tetraethyl orthosilicate. The solution was stirred<br>
15 minutes, and the another 50 milliliters of water was added, but again, no zirconia<br>
precipitated, indicating that it had become incorporated into the silica. The solution<br>
was allowed to stir another 15 minutes, then ammonium hydroxide was added until<br>
gellation occurred causing a clear gel to form. The gel was dried in a vacuum oven at<br>
120°C overnight, then a sample was calcined in dry air at 600°C for three hours. This<br>
sample produced an activity of 230 grams of polymer per gram of silica-zirconia per<br>
hour when tested for polymerization activity with an organometal compound and an<br>
organoaluminum compound.<br>
Inventive Examples 14 &amp; 15 (Fluorided Silica-Zirconia)<br>
Two samples of the silica-zirconia described in Example 13, one<br>
obtained before being calcined at 600°C (Example 14) and the other obtained<br>
afterward (Example 15), were impregnated with a methanol solution containing<br>
enough ammonium bifluoride to equal 10% of the weight of the sample. Both samples<br>
were dried at 12O°C overnight under vacuum, then calcined at 500°C for three hours in<br>
air. When tested for polymerization activity with an organometal compound and an<br>
organoaluminum compound, both yielded a high activity of between 3000 and 5000<br>
grams of polymer per gram of fluorided silica-zirconia per hour.<br>
