				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Over the past several decades, continuous strides have<br>
been made to improve the treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Approximately 90% of people with diabetes have type 2<br>
diabetes also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes<br>
mellitus (NIDDM). Type 2 diabetics generally still make<br>
insulin, but the insulin cannot be used effectively by the<br>
body"s cells. This is primarily because the amount of<br>
insulin produced in response to rising blood sugar levels is<br>
not sufficient to allow cells to efficiently take up glucose<br>
and thus, reduce blood sugar levels.<br>
Often, individuals with NIDDM can initially control<br>
their blood glucose levels by taking oral medications.<br>
However, oral medications do not slow the progressive loss<br>
of p cell function that occurs in type 2 patients and<br>
eventually these types of medications are not sufficient to<br>
control blood glucose levels.<br>
A large body of pre-clinical and clinical research data<br>
suggests that glucagon-like pepide-1 (GLP-1) shows great<br>
promise as a treatment for NIDDM especially when oral agents<br>
begin to fail. GLP-1 induces numerous biological effects<br>
such as stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon<br>
secretion, inhibiting gastric emptying, enhancing glucose<br>
utilization, and inducing weight loss. Further, pre-<br>
clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 may also act to prevent<br>
the (3 cell deterioration that occurs as the disease<br>
progresses. Perhaps the most salient characteristic of GLP-<br>
1 is its ability to stimulate insulin secretion without the<br>
associated risk of hypoglycemia that is seen when using<br>
insulin therapy or some types of oral therapies that act by<br>
increasing insulin expression.<br>
As NIDDM progresses it becomes extremely important to<br>
achieve near normal glycemic control and thereby minimize<br>
the complications associated with prolonged hyperglycemia.<br>
GLP-1 would appear to be the drug of choice. However, the<br>
usefulness of therapy involving GLP-1 peptides has been<br>
limited by the fact that GLP-1(1-37) is poorly active, and<br>
the two naturally occurring truncated peptides, GLP-1(7-<br>
37)OH and GLP-1(7-36)NH2, are rapidly cleared in vivo and<br>
have extremely short in vivo half-lives. Further, GLP-1<br>
compound formulations currently in development cannot be<br>
given orally and like insulin must be injected. Thus,<br>
despite the clear medical advantages associated with therapy<br>
involving GLP-1, the short half-life which results in a drug<br>
that must be injected one or more times a day has impeded<br>
commercial development efforts.<br>
Generally, moving patients to an injectable therapy is<br>
quite difficult. Many diabetics are unwilling to undertake<br>
any type of intensive injection therapy due to the<br>
discomfort associated with the many injections required to<br>
maintain adequate glucose control. Furthermore, diabetics<br>
on insulin are generally required to monitor their blood<br>
glucose which involves additional needle sticks. This type<br>
of therapy can be both psychologically and physically<br>
painful. This is especially true when patients have been<br>
treated solely with oral medications throughout the<br>
progression of the disease. Thus, there is a need for a<br>
non-injectable therapy that involves administration of a<br>
GLP-1 compound by alternative means such as by the oral or<br>
pulmonary route. Non-invasive delivery technology provides<br>
a means to increase patient convenience and hence compliance<br>
with a therapy that could potentially delay the onset of<br>
type-2 diabetes. GLP-1 analogs that have been previously<br>
described do not lend themselves to this technology because<br>
their potency is generally too low to offset the anticipated<br>
drop in bioavailability associated with administration by<br>
the oral or pulmonary route compared to a subcutaneous<br>
injection. Thus, a limiting factor with respect to oral or<br>
pulmonary administration of proteins and peptides is the<br>
relatively large amount of protein required due to poor<br>
absorption and local metabolism.<br>
The present invention solves the problems associated<br>
with non-invasive delivery of GLP-1 through the development<br>
of novel GLP-1 analogs that are extremely potent. The<br>
increased potency of these analogs facilitates the use of<br>
delivery technology associated with limited bioavailability.<br>
The present invention makes possible non-injectable therapy<br>
through the delivery of cost-effective amounts of a potent<br>
biologically active GLP-1 compound such that therapeutic<br>
serum levels are achieved.<br>
It has now been found that a number of GLP-1 compounds<br>
with modifications at one or more of the following<br>
positions: 8, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 33, and 37<br>
show increased potency compared with Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH.<br>

A GLP-1 compound is a polypeptide having from about<br>
twenty-five to about thirty-nine naturally occurring or non-<br>
naturally occurring amino acids and has sufficient homology<br>
to GLP-1(7-37)OH such that it exhibits insulinotropic<br>
activity.<br>
"Insulinotropic activity" refers to the ability to<br>
stimulate insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose<br>
levels, thereby causing glucose uptake by cells and<br>
decreased plasma glucose levels. Insulinotropic activity<br>
can be assessed by methods known in the art, including using<br>
in vivo experiments and in vitro assays that measure GLP-1<br>
receptor binding activity or receptor activation, e.g.,<br>
assays employing pancreatic islet cells or insulinoma cells,<br>
as described in EP 619,322 to Gelfand, et al., and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,120,712, respectively. The entire teachings of<br>
these references are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Insulinotropic activity is routinely measured in humans by<br>
measuring insulin levels or C-peptide levels.<br>
Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids include<br>
a-methyl amino acids (e.g., a-methyl alanine) , D-amino<br>
acids, histidine-like amino acids (e.g., 2-amino-histidine,<br>
P-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, a-fluoromethyl-histidine<br>
and a-methyl-histidine) , amino acids having an extra<br>
methylene in the side chain ("homo" amino acids) and amino<br>
acids in which a carboxylic acid functional group in the<br>
side chain is replaced with a sulfonic acid group (e.g.,<br>
cysteic acid). Preferably, however, the GLP-1 compounds of<br>
the present invention comprise only naturally occurring<br>
amino acids except as otherwise specifically provided<br>
herein.<br>
A GLP-1 compound typically comprises a polypeptide<br>
having the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-37)OH, an analog<br>
of GLP-1 (7-37)OH, a fragment of GLP-1(7-37)OH or a fragment<br>
of a GLP-1(7-37)OH analog. GLP-1(7-37)OH has the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3:<br>
7His-Ala-Glu-10Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-15Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-<br>
Tyr-20Leu-Glu-Gly-Gln-Ala-25Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-Ile-30Ala-<br>
Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-35Gly-Arg-37Gly<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 3)<br>
By custom in the art, the amino terminus of GLP-1(7-37)OH<br>
has been assigned number residue 7 and the carboxy-terminus,<br>
number 37.. The other amino acids in the polypeptide are<br>
numbered consecutively, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3. For<br>
example, position 12 is phenylalanine and position 22 is<br>
glycine. When not specified, the C-terminal is in the<br>
traditional carboxyl form.<br>
A "GLP-1 fragment" is a polypeptide obtained after<br>
truncation of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus<br>
and/or C-terminus of GLP-1(7-37)OH or a GLP-1(7-37)OH<br>
analog. The nomenclature used to- describe GLP-1(7-37)OH<br>
carries over to GLP-1 fragments. For example, GLP-1(9-36)OH<br>
denotes a GLP-1 fragment obtained by truncating two amino<br>
acids from the N-terminus and one amino acid from the C-<br>
terminus. The amino acids in the fragment are denoted by the<br>
same number as the corresponding amino acid in GLP-1(7-<br>
37) OH. For example, the N-terminal glutamic acid in GLP-<br>
1(9-36)OH is at position 9; position 12 is occupied by<br>
phenylalanine; and position 22 is occupied by glycine, as in<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH.<br>
GLP-1 compounds include "GLP-1 analogs" which have<br>
sufficient homology to GLP-1(7-37)OH, GLP-1(7-36)NH2 or a<br>
fragment of GLP-1(7-37)OH or GLP-1(7-36)NH2 such that the<br>
analog has insulinotropic activity. Preferably, a GLP-1<br>
analog has the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-37)OH or a<br>
fragment thereof, modified so that from one, two, three,<br>
four, five, or six amino acids differ from the amino acid in<br>
the corresponding position of GLP-1(7-37)OH or a fragment of<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH. In the nonmenclature used herein to<br>
designate GLP-1 compounds, the substituting amino acid and<br>
its position is indicated prior to the parent structure.<br>
For example, Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)OH designates a GLP-1 compound<br>
in which the glycine normally found at position 22 of GLP-<br>
1(7-37)OH has been replaced with glutamic acid; Val8-Glu22"<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH designates a GLP-1 compound in which alanine<br>
normally found at position 8 and glycine normally found at<br>
position 22 of GLP-1(7-37)OH have been replaced with valine<br>
and glutamic acid, respectively.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds of the present invention have<br>
increased potency compared to Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH. Native<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH is rapidly degraded by dipeptidylamino-<br>
peptidase IV (DPP-IV) after injection and the half-life of<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH is approximately five minutes. Analogs such<br>
as Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH wherein the alanine at position 8 has<br>
been substituted with a different amino acid have been<br>
developed because these analogs are resistant to DPP-IV<br>
degradation and thus, have an increased half-life. However,<br>
these analogs are generally not potent enough to make<br>
administration by alternative delivery technology feasible<br>
on a commercial scale. Thus, Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH is used as<br>
a comparator to illustrate the increased potency of the<br>
novel GLP-1 compounds encompassed by the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention comprise GLP-1 analogs wherein the backbone for<br>
such analogs or fragments contains an amino acid other than<br>
alanine at position 8 (position 8 analogs). The backbone<br>
may also include L-histidine, D-histidine, or modified forms<br>
of histidine such as desamino-histidine, 2-amino-histidine,<br>
(3-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, a-fluoromethyl-<br>
histidine, or a-methyl-histidine at position 7. It is<br>
preferable that these position 8 analogs contain one or more<br>
additional changes at positions 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25,<br>
27, 30, 33, and 37 compared to the corresponding amino acid<br>
of native GLP-1(7-37)OH. It is more preferable that these<br>
position 8 analogs contain one or more additional changes at<br>
positions 16, 18, 22, 25 and 33 compared to the<br>
corresponding amino acid of native GLP-1(7-37)OH.<br>

It is preferable that the GLP-1 compounds of formula I<br>
or II have 6 or fewer changes compared to the corresponding<br>
amino acids in native GLP-1(7-37)OH. More preferred analogs<br>
have 5 or fewer changes compared to the corresponding amino<br>
acids in native GLP-1(7-37)OH or have 4 or fewer changes<br>
compared to the corresponding amino acids in native GLP-1(7-<br>
37)OH or have 3 changes compared to the corresponding amino<br>
acids in native GLP-1 (7-37)OH.<br>
Some preferred GLP-1 compounds of formula I and II<br>
having multiple substitutions include GLP-1(7-37)OH wherein<br>
position 8 is valine or glycine, position 22 is glutamic<br>
acid, position 16 is tyrosine, leucine or tryptophan,<br>
position 18 is tyrosine, tryptophan, or isoleucine, position<br>
25 is valine and position 33 is isoleucine. Other preferred<br>
GLP-1 compounds include the following: Val8-Tyr16-GLP-1(7-<br>
37) OH, Val.8-Tyr12-Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)OH, Val8-Tyr16-Phe19-GLP-<br>
1(7-37) OH, Val8-Tyr16-Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)OH, Val8-Trp16-Glu22-<br>

Val8-Phe18-Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)OH, and Val8-Ile18-Glu22-GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH.<br>
Substitutions at the positions disclosed herein result<br>
in a GLP-1 compound with increased potency compared to the<br>
potency of Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH. The GLP-1 compounds of the<br>
present invention generally are between 3 and 6-fold more<br>
potent than Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH. For example, table I in<br>
example 4 provides a list of GLP-1 compounds with an in<br>
vitro pote;ncy compared to that obtained for Val8-GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH. Preferably, the analogs are greater than 3-fold more<br>
potent than Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH. The in vitro potencies<br>
disclosed in table 1 are generally representative of in vivo<br>
potency relative to Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH. For example,<br>
Figures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate a higher in vivo potency for<br>
Val8-Glu22-Val25-Ile33-GLP-1(7-37)OH compared to Val8-GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH.<br>
Furthermore, many of these more potent analogs have a<br>
reduced propensity to aggregate and thus, have increased<br>
stability. GLP-1 compounds can exist in at least two<br>
different forms. The first form is physiologically active<br>
and dissolves readily in aqueous solution at physiological<br>
pH (7.4) . A second inactive form is readily produced when<br>
aqueous GLP-1 solutions are agitated, exposed to hydrophobic<br>
surfaces or have large air/water interfaces. The tendency<br>
to convert to the insoluble form considerably complicates<br>
the production of commercial quantities of active GLP-1<br>
compounds. Thus, GLP-1 compounds that have a reduced<br>
propensity to aggregate in solution and are more potent than<br>
Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH are preferred. For example, the GLP-1<br>
compounds Val8-Glu22-GLP-1 (7-37) OH, Val8-Glu30-GLP-l (7-37) OH,<br>
and Val8-His37-GLP-1(7-37)OH show a markedly decreased<br>
propensity to aggregate in solution compared to Val8-GLP-<br>
1(7-37)OH (See example 3). Thus, preferred GLP-1 compounds<br>
,of the present invention have either a glutamic acid at<br>
position 22, a glutamic acid at position 30, or a histidine<br>
at position 37 or combinations thereof in addition to<br>
substitutions at other positions such as 12, 16, 18, 19, 20,<br>
25, 27, and 33.<br>
As used herein, the term "GLP-1 compound" also<br>
includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds described herein. A GLP-1 compound of this<br>
invention can possess a sufficiently acidic, a<br>
sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and<br>
accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic<br>
bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a salt.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are<br>
inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
and the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenyl-<br>
sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid,<br>
benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like. Examples of<br>
such salts include the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate,<br>
sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate,<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate,<br>
chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate,<br>
decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate,<br>
caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate,<br>
succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-<br>
1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate,<br>
methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate,<br>
methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate,<br>
phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate,<br>
lactate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, tartrate,<br>
methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-<br>
sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate, and the<br>
like.<br>
Base addition salts include those derived from<br>
inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline<br>
earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the<br>
like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this<br>
invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and the<br>
like.<br>
Although the GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention are particularly suited for oral<br>
administration, they can be delivered by nasal<br>
administration, inhalation or parenterally. Parenteral<br>
administration can include, for example, systemic<br>
administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injection. The GLP-1<br>
compounds can be administered to the subject in<br>
conjunction with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier,<br>
diluent or excipient as part of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for treating the diseases discussed above.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be a solution or, if<br>
administered parenterally, a suspension of the GLP-1<br>
compound or a suspension of the GLP-1 compound complexed<br>
with a divalent metal cation such as zinc. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carriers may contain inert ingredients<br>
which do not interact with the peptide or peptide<br>
derivative. Standard pharmaceutical formulation<br>
techniques may be employed such as those described in<br>
Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing<br>
Company, Easton, PA. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers<br>
for parenteral administration include, for example,<br>
sterile water, physiological saline, bacteriostatic<br>
saline (saline containing about 0.9% mg/ml benzyl<br>
alcohol), phosphate-buffered saline, Hank"s solution,<br>
Ringer"s-lactate and the like. Some examples of suitable<br>
excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, trehalose,<br>
sorbitol, and mannitol.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds may be formulated for<br>
administration such that blood plasma levels are<br>
maintained in the efficacious range for extended time<br>
periods. Various means can be employed to achieve a<br>
protracted time action including, for example, the<br>
incorporation of GLP-1 compounds into suspended amorphous<br>
or crystalline particles wherein the GLP-1 compound is<br>
complexed with zinc and slowly solubilizes upon<br>
administration. GLP-1 particles that provide a<br>
protracted action are described in EP 926 159 by Hoffmann<br>
et al. and EP 619 322 by Danley et al. In addition,<br>
depot formulations wherein a bioadsorbable polymer is<br>
used to provide sustained release over time are also<br>
suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
The main barrier to effective oral peptide drug<br>
delivery is poor bioavailability due to degradation of<br>
peptides by acids and enzymes, poor absorption through<br>
epithelial membranes, and transition of peptides to an<br>
insoluble form after exposure to the acidic pH<br>
environment in the digestive tract. This reduced<br>
bioavailability necessitates the use of GLP-1 compounds<br>
with increased potency. Oral delivery systems for<br>
peptides such as those encompassed by the present<br>
invention are known in the art. For example, GLP-1<br>
compounds can be encapsulated using microspheres and then<br>
delivered orally. For example, GLP-1 compounds can be<br>
encapsulated into microspheres composed of a commercially<br>
available, biocompatible, biodegradable polymer,<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-COOH and olive oil as a<br>
filler. See Joseph et al. (2000) Diabetologia 43:1319-<br>
1328. Other types of microsphere technology is also<br>
available commercially such as Medisorb® and Prolease®<br>
biodegradable polymers from Alkermes. Medisorb® polymers<br>
can be produced with any of the lactide isomers.<br>
Lactide:glycolide ratios can be varied between 0:100 and<br>
100:0 allowing for a broad range of polymer properties.<br>
This allows for the design of delivery systems and<br>
implantable devices with resorption times ranging from<br>
weeks to months. Emisphere has also published numerous<br>
articles discussing oral delivery technology for peptides<br>
and proteins. For example, see WO 9528838 by Leone-bay<br>
et al. which discloses specific carriers comprised of<br>
modified amino acids to facilitate absorption.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds described herein can be used to<br>
treat subjects with a wide variety of diseases and<br>
conditions. GLP-1 compounds encompassed by the present<br>
invention exert their biological effects by acting at a<br>
receptor referred to as the "GLP-1 receptor" (see U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,670,360 to Thorrens). Subjects with diseases<br>
and/or conditions that respond favorably to GLP-1 receptor<br>
stimulation or to the adminstration of GLP-1 compounds can<br>
therefore be treated with the GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention. These subjects are said to "be in need of<br>
treatment with GLP-1 compounds" or "in need of GLP-1<br>
receptor stimulation".<br>
Included are subjects with non-insulin dependent<br>
diabetes, insulin dependent diabetes, stroke (see WO<br>
00/16797 by Efendic), myocardial infarction (see WO 98/08531<br>
by Efendic), obesity (see WO 98/19698 by Efendic), catabolic<br>
changes after surgery (see U.S. Patent No. 6,006,753 to<br>
Efendic), functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome<br>
(see WO 99/64060 by Efendic). Also included are subjects<br>
requiring prophylactic treatment with a GLP-1 compound,<br>
e.g., subjects at risk for developing non-insulin dependent<br>
diabetes (see WO 00/07617). Additional subjects include<br>
those with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting<br>
glucose, subjects whose body weight is about 25% above<br>
normal body weight for the subject"s height and body build,<br>
subjects with a partial pancreatectomy, subjects having one<br>
or more parents with non-insulin dependent diabetes,<br>
subjects who have had gestational diabetes and subjects who<br>
have had acute or chronic pancreatitis are at risk for<br>
developing non-insulin dependent diabetes.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds of the present invention can be<br>
used to normalize blood glucose levels, prevent pancreatic<br>
(3-cell deterioration, induce p-cell proliferation, stimulate<br>
insulin gene transcription, up-regulate IDX-l/PDX-1 or other<br>
growth factors, improve (3-cell function, activate dormant (3-<br>
cells, differentiate cells into p-cells, stimulate p-cell<br>
replication, inhibit p-cell apoptosis, regulate body weight,<br>
and induce weight loss.<br>
An "effective amount" of a GLP-1 compound is the<br>
quantity which results in a desired therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic effect without causing unacceptable side-<br>
effects when administered to a subject in need of GLP-1<br>
receptor stimulation. A "desired therapeutic effect"<br>
includes one or more of the following: 1) an amelioration of<br>
the symptom(s) associated with the disease or condition; 2)<br>
a delay in the onset of symptoms associated with the disease<br>
or condition; 3) increased longevity compared with the<br>
absence of the treatment; and 4) greater quality of life<br>
compared with the absence of the treatment. For example, an<br>
"effective amount" of a GLP-1 compound for the treatment of<br>
diabetes is the quantity that would result in greater<br>
control of blood glucose concentration than in the absence<br>
of treatment, thereby resulting in a delay in the onset of<br>
diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy or<br>
kidney disease. An "effective amount" of a GLP-1 compound<br>
for the prevention of diabetes is the quantity that would<br>
delay, compared with the absence of treatment, the onset of<br>
elevated blood glucose levels that require treatment with<br>
anti-hypoglycaemic drugs such as sulfonyl ureas,<br>
thiazolidinediones, insulin and/or bisguanidines.<br>
An "effective amount" of the GLP-1 compound<br>
administered to a subject will also depend on the type and<br>
severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the<br>
subject, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and<br>
tolerance to drugs. Typically, the GLP-1 compounds of the<br>
present invention will be administered such that plasma<br>
levels are within the range of about 5 picomoles/liter and<br>
about 200 picomoles/liter. Optimum plasma levels for Val8-<br>
GLP-1(7-37)OH were determined to be between 30<br>
picomoles/liter and about 200 picomoles/liter. Because the<br>
GLP-1 compounds of the present invention are more potent<br>
than Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH, the optimum plasma levels will be<br>
lower. Generally, a GLP-1 compound that has an in vitro or<br>
in vivo potency that is 3-fold better than Val8-GLP-1(7-<br>
37)OH will be administered such that plasma levels are 3-<br>
fold lower than the optimum levels determined for Val8-GLP-<br>
1(7-37)OH.<br>
A typical dose range for the GLP-1 compounds of the<br>
present invention will range from about 0.01 mg per day to<br>
about 1000 mg per day for an adult. Preferably, the dosage<br>
ranges from about 0.1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day,<br>
more preferably from about 1.0 mg/day to about 10 mg/day.<br>
A "subject" is a mammal, preferably a human, but<br>
can also be an animal, e.g., companion animals (e.g.,<br>
dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows,<br>
sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory<br>
animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like).<br>
The GLP-1 compounds of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by using standard methods of solid-phase peptide<br>
synthesis techniques. Peptide synthesizers are commercially<br>
available from, for example, Applied Biosysterns in Foster<br>
City CA. Reagents for solid phase synthesis are<br>
commercially available, for example, from Midwest Biotech<br>
(Fishers, IN). Solid phase peptide synthesizers can be used<br>
according to manufacturers instructions for blocking<br>
interfering groups, protecting the amino acid to be reacted,<br>
coupling, decoupling, and capping of unreacted amino acids.<br>
Typically, an (-N-carbamoyl protected amino acid and<br>
the N-terminal amino acid on the growing peptide chain on a<br>
resin is coupled at room temperature in an inert solvent<br>
such as dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or methylene<br>
chloride in the presence of coupling agents such as<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and a<br>
base such as diisopropylethylamine. The (-N-carbamoyl<br>
protecting group is removed from the resulting peptide resin<br>
using a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid or piperidine,<br>
and the coupling reaction repeated with the next desired N-<br>
protected amino acid to be added to the peptide chain.<br>
Suitable amine protecting groups are well known in the art<br>
and are described, for example, in Green and Wuts,<br>
"Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and<br>
Sons, 1991, the entire teachings of which are incorporated<br>
by reference. Examples include t-butyloxycarbonyl (tBoc)<br>
-and fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).<br>
The peptides are also synthesized using standard<br>
automated solid-phase synthesis protocols using t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl- or fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-alpha-amino<br>
acids with appropriate side-chain protection. After<br>
completion of synthesis, peptides are cleaved from the<br>
solid-phase support with simultaneous side-chain<br>
deprotection using standard hydrogen fluoride methods.<br>
Crude peptides are then further purified using Reversed-<br>
Phase Chromatography on Vydac C18 columns using<br>
acetonitrile gradients in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).<br>
To remove acetonitrile, peptides are lyophilized from a<br>
solution containing 0.1 % TFA, acetonitrile and water.<br>
Purity can be verified by analytical reversed phase<br>
chromatography. Identity of peptides can be verified by<br>
mass spectrometry. Peptides can be solubilized in aqueous<br>
buffers at neutral pH.<br>

Example 1 - Preparation of the GLP-1 Compounds of the<br>
Present Invention by Solid Phase t-Boc Chemistry<br>
Approximately 0.5-0.6 grams (0.38-0.45 mmole) Boc Gly-<br>
PAM resin was placed in a standard 60 ml reaction vessel<br>
and double couplings were run on an Applied Biosytems<br>
ABI430A peptide synthesizer. The following side-chain<br>
protected amino acids (2 mmole cartridges of Boc amino<br>
acids) were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN) and<br>
used in the synthesis:<br>
Arg-Tosyl (TOS), Asp-5-cyclohexyl ester(CHXL), Glu-8-<br>
cycohexyl ester (CHXL), His-benzyloxymethyl(BOM), Lys-2-<br>
chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2C1-Z), Met-sulfoxide (0), Ser-O-<br>
benzyl ether (OBzl), Thr-O-benzyl ether (OBzl), Trp-formyl<br>
(CHO) and Tyr-2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2Br-Z) and Boc Gly<br>
PAM resin. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), di-<br>
isopropylethylamine (DIEA), 0.5 M hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBt) in DMF and 0.5 M dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in<br>
dichloromethane were purchased from PE-Applied Biosystems<br>
(Foster City, CA). Dimethylformamide (DMF-Burdick and<br>
Jackson) and dichloromethane (DCM-Mallinkrodt) were<br>
purchased from Mays Chemical Co. (Indianapolis, IN).<br>
Standard double couplings were run using either<br>
symmetric anhydride or HOBt esters, both formed using DCC.<br>
A second set of double couplings (without TFA deprotection)<br>
were run at Trp31, Thrl3 and Thrll. At the completion of<br>
the syntheses, the N-terminal Boc group was removed and the<br>
peptidyl resins treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to<br>
deformylate the Trp side chain. After washing with DCM, the<br>
resins were transferred to a TEFLON reaction vessel and<br>
dried in vacuo.<br>
For analogs containing Met, an on-the-resin reduction<br>
was done using TFA/10% dimethyl sulfide (DMS)/2%<br>
concentrated HC1. Cleavages were done by attaching the<br>
reaction vessels to a HF (hydrofluoric acid) apparatus<br>
(Penninsula Laboratories). 1 ml m-cresol per gram/resin was<br>
added and 10 ml HF (purchased from AGA, Indianapolis, IN)<br>
was condensed into the pre-cooled vessel. 1 ml DMS per gram<br>
resin was added when methionine was present. The reactions<br>
were stirred one hour in an ice bath and the HF removed in<br>
vacuo. The residues were suspended in ethyl ether and the<br>
solids were filtered and washed with ether. Each peptide<br>
was extracted into aqueous acetic acid and either freeze<br>
dried or loaded directly onto a reverse-phase column.<br>
Purifications were run on a 2.2 x 25cm VYDAC C18 column<br>
in buffer A (0.1% Trifluoroacteic acid in water, B: 0.1% TFA<br>
in acetonitrile). A gradient of 20% to 90% B was run on an<br>
HPLC (Waters) over 12 0 minutes at 10 ml/minute while<br>
monitoring the UV at 280 ran (4.0 A) and collecting one<br>
minute fractions. Appropriate fractions were combined,<br>
frozen and lyophilized. Dried products were analyzed by<br>
HPLC (0.46 x 15 cm METASIL AQ C18) and MALDI mass<br>
spectrometry.<br>

Present Invention by Solid Phase F-Moc Chemistry<br>
Approximately 114 mg (50 mMole) FMOC Gly WANG resin<br>
(purchased from NovaBiochem, LaJolla, CA) was placed in each<br>
programmed well of the 96well reaction block and double<br>
couplings were run on an Advanced ChemTech 396 peptide<br>
synthesizer. Analogs with a C-terminal amide were prepared<br>
using 75 mg (50 µmole) Rink Amide AM resin (NovaBiochem,<br>
LaJolla, CA).<br>
The following FMOC amino acids were purchased from<br>

(Boc), Ser-t-butyl ether (OtBu), Thr-t-butyl ether (OtBu),<br>
Trp-t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), Tyr-t-butyl ether (OtBu).<br>
Solvents dimethylformamide (DMF-Burdick and Jackson),<br>
N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP-Burdick and Jackson),<br>
dichloromethane (DCM-Mallinkrodt) were purchased from Mays<br>
Chemical Co. (Indianapolis, IN).<br>
Hydroxybenzotrizole (HOBt) , di-isopropylcarbodiimde<br>
(DIC), di-isopropylethylamine (DIEA), and piperidine (Pip)<br>
were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co (Milwaukee, WI).<br>
All amino acids were dissolved in 0.45 M HOBt in NMP<br>
and 50 minutes DIC/HOBt activated couplings were run after<br>
20 minutes deprotection using 20% Pip/DMF. Each resin was<br>
washed with DMF after deprotections and couplings. After<br>
the last coupling and deprotection, the peptidyl resins were<br>
washed with DCM and dried in vacuo in the reaction block.<br>
With the reaction/cleavage block assembly in place, 2<br>
ml Reagent K was added to each well and the cleavage<br>
reaction mixed for 2 hours [Reagent K= 0.75 gm phenol, 0.5<br>
ml thioanisole, 0.25 ml ethanedithiol, 0.5 ml water per 10<br>
ml trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), all purchased from Aldrich<br>
Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI]. The TFA filtrates were added<br>
to 40 ml ethyl ether and the precipitants centrifuged 2<br>
minutes at 2000 rpm. The supernatants were decanted, the<br>
pellets re-suspended in 40 ml ether, re-centrifuged, re-<br>
decanted, dried under nitrogen and then in vacuo.<br>
0.3-0.6mg of each product was dissolved in 1 ml 0.1%<br>
TFA/acetonitrile(ACN) and 20 ul was analyzed on HPLC [0.46 x<br>
15cm METASIL AQ C18, lml/min, 45C°, 214 nM (0.2A),<br>
A=0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/50%ACN. Gradient = 50% B to 90% B over<br>
30 minutes].<br>
Purifications were run on a 2.2 x 25 cm VYDAC C18<br>
column in buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacteic acid in water, B:<br>
0.1% TFA in acetonitrile). A gradient of 20% to 90% B was<br>
run on an HPLC (Waters) over 120 minutes at 10 ml/minute<br>
while monitoring the UV at 280 nm (4.0A) and collecting 1<br>
minute fractions. Appropriate fractions were combined,<br>
frozen and lyophilized. Dried products were analyzed by<br>
HPLC (0.46 x 15 cm METASIL AQ C18) and MALDI mass<br>
spectrometry.<br>
Example 3 - 6LP Aggregation Assay:<br>
GLP peptides of this invention were analyzed with<br>
respect to their potential to aggregate in solution. In<br>
general, peptides in solution were stirred at elevated<br>
temperature in a suitable buffer while recording turbidity<br>
at 350 nm as a function of time. Time to the onset of<br>
aggregation was measured to quantify the potential of a<br>
given GLP molecule to aggregate under these stressed<br>
conditions.<br>
Protocol:<br>
A GLP-1 compound was first dissolved under alkaline<br>
conditions (pH 10.5) for 30 minutes to dissolve any pre-<br>
aggregated material. The solution was then adjusted to pH<br>
7.4 and filtered. Specifically, 4 mg of a lyophilized GLP-1<br>
compound was dissolved in 3 ml of 10 mM phosphate/10 mM<br>
citrate. The pH was adjusted to 10.0-10.5 and held for 30<br>
minutes. The solution was adjusted with HC1 to pH 7.4 and<br>
filtered through a suitable filter, for example a Millex GV<br>
syringe filter (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). This<br>
solution was then diluted to a final sample containing 0.3<br>
mg/mL protein in 10 mM citrate, 10 mM phosphate, 150 mM<br>
NaCl, and adjusted to pH 7.4 to 7.5. The sample was<br>
incubated at 37°C in a quartz cuvette. Every five minutes<br>
the turbidity of the solution was measured at 350 nm on an<br>
AVIV Model 14DS UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ).<br>
For 30 seconds prior to and during the measurement the<br>
solution was stirred using a magnetic stir bar from Starna<br>
Cells, Inc. (Atascadero, CA). An increase in OD at 350 nm<br>
indicates aggregation of the GLP-peptide. The time to<br>
aggregation was approximated by the intersection of linear<br>
fits to the pre-growth and growth phase according to method<br>
of Drake (Arvinte T, Cudd A, and Drake AF. (1993; J. Bio.<br>
Chem. 268, 6415-6422).<br>
The cuvette was cleaned between experiments with a<br>
caustic soap solution (e.g., Contrad-70).<br>
The results for a number of GLP-1 compounds of the<br>
present invention are reported in Table 1 as the time in<br>
hours required for the compound to aggregate. As can be<br>
seen, the compounds of the present invention show greatly<br>
increased aggregation times over GLP-1 compounds known in<br>
the prior art.<br>
The GLP-1 compound Val8-Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)OH had an<br>
aggregation time of approximately 72 hours at 30°C compared<br>
to an aggregation time of less than 1 hour for Val8-GLP-1(7-<br>
37) OH at 30°C. The GLP-1 compound Val8-Glu30-GLP-l (7-37) OH<br>
had an aggregation time of approximately 30 hours and the<br>
GLP-1 compound Val8-His37-GLP-1(7-37)OH had an aggregation<br>
time greater than 4 0 hours at 30°C.<br>
Example 4 - GLP-1 Receptor Activation With the GLP-1<br>
Compounds of the Present Invention<br>
The ability of the GLP-1 compounds of the present<br>
invention to activate the GLP-1 receptor was assessed using<br>
in vitro assays such as those described in EP 619,322 to<br>
Gelfand, et al., and U.S. Patent No. 5,120,712,<br>
respectively. The entire teachings of these references are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The activity of these<br>
compounds relative to the activity of Val8-GLP-1(7-37)OH is<br>
reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 5 - Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in<br>
rats<br>
A double cannulation procedure was performed on fasting<br>
wistar male rats to facilitate injection of solutions and<br>
withdrawal of blood. Rats were injected through the jugular<br>
cannula with a bolus of 10% glucose solution followed by a<br>
solution containing a specific amount of a GLP-1 compound.<br>
Rats were injected with 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 10<br>
µg/kg of GLP-1 compound. Blood was collected through the<br>
carotid cannula 2, 4, 6, 10, and 30 minutes following the<br>
injection of GLP-1 compound and analyzed. Plasma insulin<br>
and plasma glucose levels were measured in each sample.<br>
Average insulin and glucose levels are illustrated in<br>
