				<td>The present invention relates to novel nitrophenyl mustard and nitrophenylaziridine<br>
alcohols, to their corresponding phosphates, to their use as targeted cytotoxic agents;<br>
as bioreductive drugs in hypoxic tumours, and to their use in cell ablation, including<br>
gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (GDEPT) and antibody-directed enzyme-<br>
prodrug therapy (ADEPT), in conjunction with nitroreductase enzymes.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
The use of tumour-selective prodrugs (relatively inactive compounds that can be selectively<br>
converted to more active compounds in vivo) is a valuable concept in cancer therapy (see, for<br>
example Denny, Eur. J. Med. Chem. (2001) 36, 577).<br>
For example a prodrug may be converted into an anti-tumour agent under the influence of <br>
an enzyme that is linkable to a monoclonal antibody that will bind to a tumour associated<br>
antigen. The combination of such a prodrug with such an enzyme monoclonal/antibody<br>
conjugate represents a very powerful clinical agent. This approach to cancer therapy, often<br>
referred to as "antibody directed enzyme/prodrug therapy" (ADEPT), is disclosed in<br>
W088/07378.<br>
A further therapeutic approach termed "virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy" (VDEPT)<br>
has been proposed as a method for treating tumour cells in patients using prodrugs.<br>
Tumour cells are targeted with a viral vector carrying a gene encoding an enzyme capable<br>
of activating a prodrug. The gene may be transcriptionally regulated by tissue specific<br>
promoter or enhancer sequences. The viral vector enters tumour cells and expresses the<br>
enzyme, in order that a prodrug is converted to an active drug within the tumour cells<br>
(Huber et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991) 88, 8039). Alternatively, non-viral<br>
methods for the delivery of genes have been used. Such methods include calcium<br>
phosphate co-precipitation, microinjection, liposomes, direct DNA uptake, and receptor-<br>
mediated DNA transfer. These are reviewed in Morgan &amp; French, Annu. Rev. Biochem.,<br><br>
1993, 62; 191. The term "GDEPT" (gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy) is used to<br>
include both viral and non-viral delivery systems (Denny et al US 6,310,237).<br>
4-Nitroaromatic compounds are reduced by both mammalian and bacterial flavoprotein<br>
enzymes, which effect stepwise addition of up to six electrons. The major enzymatic<br>
metabolite is usually the 4-electron reduced species (hydroxylamine).<br>
A number of nitrophenyl mustards and nitrophenylaziridines have been reported as<br>
prodrugs for use in gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (GDEPT) in conjunction<br>
with nitroreductase enzymes. In particular, CB 1954 [5-(aziridin-l-yl)-2,4-<br>
dinitrobenzamide; (1) [shown below] is reported to be a substrate for the aerobic<br>
nitroreductase NTR (nfsB gene product) isolated from E. coli B (Boland et al.,<br>
Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991,41, 867-875; Anlezark et al., Biochem. Pharmacol, 1992,<br>
44,2289-2295; Parkinson et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000,43, 3624). This compound has<br>
been used as a prodrug in both ADEPT (Knox et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1995,49,<br>
1641-1647) and GDEPT (Bridge water .et al.,. Eur. J. Cancer, 1995,31 A, 2362-2370;<br>
Bailey et al., Gene Ther., 1996,3,1143-1150; Bailey and Hart, Gene Ther., 1997,4,<br>
80-81; Green et al., Cancer Gene Ther., 1997, 4,229-238) applications, including a<br>
clinical trial (Chung-Faye et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 2001, 7, 2662-2668).<br>
Similarly, the dinitrophenyl mustard SN 23862 (2) is also a substrate for NTR, and shows<br>
selective toxicity towards cell lines that express the enzyme. It is activated by nitro group<br>
reduction (Palmer et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995,38,1229; Kestell et al, Cancer Chemother.<br>
Pharmacol., 2000,46,365-374). The 4-SO2Me derivative (3) was also a substrate (Atwell<br>
et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Des., 1996,11, 553), as were the regioisomers (4) and (5)<br>
(Friedlos et al., J. Med. Chem., 1997,40,1270).<br><br><br>
However, compounds of this type were not very effective as bioreductive prodrugs when<br>
these compounds were activated in hypoxic tumour tissue by endogenous reductase enzymes,<br>
showing potency ratios of 2-5 fold under hypoxic conditions relative to oxic conditions in the<br>
wild-type AA8 cell line, using a clonogenic assay (Palmer et al., J. Med. Chem. 1996,39,<br>
2518-2528).<br>
Some phosphate analogues of mustards have been described, for the purpose of solubilising<br>
the compounds. The best known is estramustine phosphate (Estracyt; 6), which has been<br>
shown to bind to tubulin binding domains on various microtubule-associated proteins<br>
(Moraga et ah, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1992, 1121, 97-103), and which has been shown<br>
to be active in advanced breast cancer (Keren-Rosenberg et al., Semin. Oncol., 1997, 24<br>
(Suppl. 3), 26-29), but has not been shown to be activated by NTR or hypoxia. Another<br>
study has also shown estramustine phosphate to be a radiation sensitizer (Kim et al., Int. J.<br>
Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys., 1994,29, 555-557). The phenol mustard phosphate analogue 7<br>
is a carboxypeptidase substrate that is not activated under hypoxic conditions, (Matsui et<br>
al., Japanese Patent 07082280 A2,1995), and the solubilised mustard 8 has been<br>
described as a phosphatase inhibitor but has not been shown to be activated under hypoxic<br>
conditions (Workman, Chem.-Biol. Interact., 1978, 20,103-112).<br><br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a specific class of nitrophenyl mustards<br>
and aziridines, bearing short-chain alcohols, and their corresponding phophates for use as<br>
targeted cytotoxic agents or bioreductive prodrugs or to at least provide the public with a _<br>
useful alternative.<br>

orthologous genes in Clostridia species<br>
Preferably the method includes the further step of irradiating the tumour cells.<br>
It is to be appreciated that with ADEPT it may be necessary to supply a reducing co-<br>
factor, because these may not be present in significant concentrations outside cells. It<br>
is envisaged that a synthetic co-factor could be used to stimulate activation of the<br>
pro-drug by the likes of an intracellular enzyme. The same issue does not arise with<br>
GDEPT because there are several intracellular reducing co-factors such as the likes<br>
of NADH and NADPH in significant concentrations.<br><br>

or stabiliser.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, adjuvant, carrier, buffer or stabiliser should<br>
preferably be non-toxic and should not intertere with the efficacy of the active ingredient<br>
The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of<br>

In a thirteenth aspect of the present invention there is provided, the use in the manufacture<br>
of a medicament of an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) as defined above or<br>
a compound of Formula (II)<br><br>
wherein:<br><br>
X represents at any available ring position -CONH-, -SO2NH-, -O-, -CH2-, -NHCO- or<br>

pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives thereof,<br>
or mixtures thereof for use in cell ablation therapy to target cancer cells in a subject in<br>
need thereof.<br>
While the compounds of the present invention will typically be used to target tumour<br>
cells or tumour tissues in human subjects, they may be used to target tumour cells or<br>
tissues in other warm blooded animal subjects such as other primates, farm animals<br>
such as cattle, and sports animals and pets such as horses, dogs, and cats.<br>
As used throughout the specification the term "therapeutically effective amount", is<br>
to be understood as an amount of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) as<br>
defined above or a compound of any one of compounds Ia-Ic, or IIa-IIc as defined<br>
above or a mixture thereof that is sufficient to show benefit to a subject with cancer<br>
cells. The actual amount, rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the<br>
nature and severity of the disease being treated. Prescription of treatment is within<br>
the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors.<br>
As used throughout the specification the term "halogen" includes chlorine, bromine<br>
or iodine.<br><br>
It is to be understood that the compounds of the invention as defined above may be<br>
administered alone or in combination with other treatments, especially radiotherapy and<br>
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon<br>
the condition to be treated.<br>
As used throughout the specification the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives and salts<br>
thereof include acid derived salts formed from are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic,<br>
citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic,<br>
isethionic acids and the like and base derived salts formed from sodium and potassium<br>
 carbonate, sodium and potassium hydroxide, ammonia, triethylamine, triethanolamine and<br>
 the like.<br><br>
As used throughout the specification, the term cell ablation is to be understood as the killing<br>
of cells, that have been engineered to express an enzyme, such as a nitroreductase, by<br>
administration of a prodrug that is activated by that enzyme. As a result, cell ablation can be<br>
used to selectively ablate specified target cells or tissue through specific enzymatic<br>
expression of a nitroreductase for example, that is specifically expressed by the tissue and<br>
which can then be employed to activate a prodrug into an active metabolite to ablate the<br>
specified target cells or tissue. (Gusterson et al. Endocrine Related Cancer, 1997,4,67-74.)<br>
The expression "substantially minimal bystander effect" is to be understood as meaning that<br>
the killing of adjoining non-targeted cells is minimal because there is little or no diffusion<br>
between the targeted and non-targeted cells of an activated metabolite that arises from the<br>
enzymatic activation of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) as defined above or a<br>
compound of any one of compounds Ia-Ic, or IIa-IIc as defined above or a mixture thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of formula (I) include the basic or acidic compounds of<br>
formula (I) that form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with both organic and inorganic<br>
acids and/or organic and inorganic bases. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are<br>
hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric,<br><br>
succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic, isethionic, and the like. Examples of suitable<br>
bases for salt formation are sodium and potassium carbonate, sodium and potassium<br>
hydroxide, ammonia, triethylamine, triethanolamine, and the like.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following<br>
description given by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying<br>
synthetic schemes.<br>
Examples of the compounds of Formula (I) where X is -CONH- can be prepared by the<br>
processes described in Scheme 1, where Z is as defined above for Formula (I).<br><br>

Representative alcohols of Formula (I) (listed in Table 1 a) show selective cytotoxicity<br>
towards human cancer cell lines transfected with either the E. coli nitroreductase cDNA<br>
(NTR) (Table 3, columns 2 and 3), or human cytochrome P450 reductase (P450R) under<br>
hypoxic conditions (Table 3, columns 4 and 5). In this table, sensitivity ratios are displayed<br>
to indicate the degree of selectivity for either NTR expression (column 3) or hypoxia<br>
(column 5). However, overexpression of P450R is not required for hypoxic selectivity.<br>
IC50 values are derived from cell proliferation experiments, following 4 hour drug<br>
exposure under a gas phase of either 20% oxygen or 0% oxygen (anoxia, achieved using<br>
an anaerobic chamber). Cells were grown under aerobic conditions for a further 5 days,<br>
and cell density estimated using the sulphorhodamine B assay, to determine the<br>
concentration of prodrug required to inhibit growth to 50% of control.<br><br><br><br>
The activity of the phosphates as hypoxic cytotoxins is demonstrated by the data in Figure<br>
1 for the representative example (Ib-7P). This employs an in vivo excision assay with the<br>
Rif-1 tumour, where the oxic tumour cells are sterilised using 15Gy of radiation, and the<br>
cytotoxicity of an agent against the remaining hypoxic cells can be quantitated.<br>
Unexpectedly, the activity of the phosphate Ib-7P is found to exceed that of its parent<br>
alcohol (IIb-7) at their respective maximum tolerated doses (Ib-7P = 750 µmol/kg; IIb-7<br><br>
= 1000 µmol/kg). This experiment demonstrates that the phosphate Ib-7P is more active<br>
against hypoxic cells than the reference hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine, and that it is more<br>
active against hypoxic cells than oxic cells (i.e. when given post irradiation than when<br>
given without irradiation). Thus Ib-7P acts as a hypoxia-selective cytotoxin in vivo.<br>
Although less active against oxic tumour cells, this activity is significant demonstrating<br>
that the compound also has utility as a single agent (without radiation).<br><br><br><br>
The notable activity of the phosphates of Formula (I) against hypoxic cells in human<br>
tumour xenografts is illustratecd by the data of Table 4. In these experiments SiHa human<br>
cervical carcinoma cells were grown subcutaneously in CD-1 nude (immunodeficient)<br>
mice. The compounds were administered at doses corresponding to 75% or 20% of the<br>
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 5 minutes after a whole body dose of ionising radiation<br>
(cobalt-60 gamma radiation) sufficient to sterilise the oxic cells (15 Gy). The tumours<br>
were excised 18 hours later, dissociated with a cocktail of proteases, and cell survival was<br>
determined using a clonogenic assay. The logarithms of cell kill were calculated from the<br>
difference in the numbers of clonogens per gram tumour tissue between treated and control<br>
tumours. All of the phosphates tested showed large effects against hypoxic cells at 75% of<br>
the MTD (Table 4, column 4). This was selective for hypoxia as demonstrated by the<br>
lesser cell kill in the absence of radiation. However, cell killing by the compounds alone<br>
was significant in all cases (Table 4, column 5) demonstrating that the compounds also<br>
have antitumour activity as single agents. Activity against hypoxic cells was also<br>
demonstrated for the same compounds at doses corresponding to only 20% of the MTD<br>
(Table 4, column 7). The reference hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine, and the reference<br>
nitrogen mustards (melphalan, chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide) lacked activity at<br>
20% of their respective MTDs.<br><br><br><br>

a Relative to controls, in the same experiment, treated with vehicle (saline) only. Log kill = log10(clonogens/g<br>

radiation alone) - log10(clonogens/g tumour for tumours treated with radiation plus compound).<br>

A representative example of the phosphates of Formula (I) as NTR activated cytotoxins is<br>
provided in Figure 2. In the WiDr in vivo growth delay assay, xenografts containing<br>
mixtures of WiDrWT and WiDrNTR cells are grown to 300mm3 and treated with a single<br>
dose of prodrug at its MTD. Tumour growth is monitored over time and animals are<br>
euthanased when mean tumour volume &gt; 1600mm3. Data is presented as time to death.<br>
Unexpectedly, the activity of the phosphate (Ib-7P) is observed to exceed that of its parent<br>
alcohol (IIb-7), when administered at their respective maximum tolerated doses (750<br>
µmol/kg). Ib-7P is superior to IIb-7 with respect to (i) time to first treatment failure (77-<br>
days vs. 17-days) and (ii) over-all survival (40% vs. 6%).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmacokinetics of the phosphate esters Ib-2mP, Ib-7P, Ib-12P and Ic-12P following<br>
administration to female CD-1 nude mice by intraperitoneal injection at a dose<br>
corresponding to 75% of the maximum tolerated dose. Monosodium salts of the<br>
compounds were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, with addition of one<br>
equivalent of sodium bicarbonate. Serial blood samples were obtained by small tail vein<br>
bleeds, and 10 ul of plasma was prepared from each. Proteins were precipitated by addition<br>
of 3 volumes of methanol, and concentrations of the phosphate esters and corresponding<br>
alcohols were determined by HPLC using either UV or mass spectrometry detection.<br><br><br>
The data shows that the phosphate esters are converted efficiently to the corresponding<br>
alcohols in mice. The alcohols are the species activated by nitroreduction in hypoxic, or<br>
NTR-expressing, cells.<br>
