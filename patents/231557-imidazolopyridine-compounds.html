				<td>IMIDAZQLOPYRIDINES AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME<br>
This non-provisional application claims benefit of priority of U.S. provisional application 60/408,812, filed September 6, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TGFß (Transforming Growth Factor p) is a member of a large family of dimeric polypeptide growth factors that includes activins, inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS).   TGFß exists in three isoforms (TGFßl, TGFß2, and TGFß3) and is present in most cells, along with its receptors. Each isoform is expressed in both a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Each TGFß isoform is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved intracellularly into a C-terminal region (latency associated peptide (LAP)) and anN-terminal region known as mature or active TGFß. LAP is typically non-covalently associated with mature TGFß prior to secretion from the cell. The LAP- TGFß complex cannot bind to the TGFß receptors and is not biologically active. TGFß is generally released (and activated) from the complex by a variety of mechanisms including interaction with thrombospondin-1 or plasmin.<br>
Following activation, TGFß binds at high affinity to the type II receptor (TGFßRII), a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase. The ligand-bound type n receptor phosphorylates the TGFß type I receptor (Alk 5) in a glycine/serine rich domain, which allows the type I receptor to recruit and phosphorylate downstream signaling molecules, Smad2 or SmadS. See, e.g., Huse, M. et al., Mol. Cell 8: 671-682 (2001). Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can then complex with Smad4, and the entire hetero-Smad complex translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of various TGFß-responsive genes.   See, e.g., Massague, J. Ann. Rev .Biochem. Med. 67: 773 (1998).<br>
Activins are also members of the TGFß superfamily that are distinct from TGFß in that they are homo- or heterodimers of activin ßa or ßb. Activins signal in a similar manner to TGFß..that is, by binding to a constitutive serine-threonine receptor kinase, activin type n receptor (ActRUB), and activating a type I serine-threonine receptor, Alk 4, to phosphorylate Smad2 or Smad3. The consequent formation of a hetero-Smad complex with Smad4 also results in the activin-induced regulation of gene transcription.<br>
Indeed, TGFß and related factors such as activin regulate a large array of cellular processes, e.g., cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoietic cells, control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cell recruitment, immunosuppression, wound healing, and extracellular matrix production.  See, e.g., Massague, J. Ann. Rev .Cell. Biol. 6: 594-641 (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, 95: 419-472 Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Growth Factors 8:1-9 (1993); and Alexandrow, M. G, Moses, H. L. Cancer Res. 55: 1452-1457 (1995). Hyperactivity of TGFß signaling pathway underlies many human disorders (e.g., excess deposition of extracellular matrix, an abnormally high level of inflammatory responses, fibrotic disorders, and progressive cancers). Similarly, activin signaling and overexpression of activin is linked to pathological disorders that involve extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis (see, e.g., Matsuse, T. et al, Am. J. Respir. CellMol Biol. 13: 17-24 (1995); Inoue, S. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 205: 441-448 (1994); Matsuse, T. et al, Am. J. Pathol 148: 707-713 (1996); DeBleser et al., Hepatology 26: 905-912 (1997); Pawlowski, I.E., et al., J. Clin. Invest. 100: 639-648 (1997); Sugiyama, M. et al., Gastroenterology 114: 550-558 (1998); Munz, B. et al., EMBOJ. 118: 5205-5215 (1999)) and inflammatory responses (see, e.g., Rosendahl, A. et al., Am. J. Repir. CellMol. Biol. 25: 60-68 (2001)). Studies have shown that TGFß and activin can act synergistically to induce extracellular matrix (see, e.g., Sugiyama, M. et al., Gastroenterology 114: 550-558, (1998)). It is therefore desirable to develop modulators (e.g., antagonists) to signaling pathway components of the TGFß family to prevent/treat disorders related to the malfunctioning of this signaling pathway.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are unexpectedly potent antagonists of the TGFß family type I receptors, Alk5 and/or Alk 4. Thus, compounds of formula (I) can be employed in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases such as fibrosis (e.g., renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis), progressive cancers, or other diseases for which reduction of TGFß family signaling activity is desirable.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a compound of formula I:<br>

It competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor and, thus inhibits the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to endogenous ligand binding.<br><br>
As compounds of formula (I) are antagonists of TGFß receptor type I (Alk5) and/or activin receptor type I (Alk4), these compounds are useful in inhibiting the consequences of TGFß and/or activin signal transduction such as the production of extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen and fibronectin), the differentiation of stromal cells to myofibroblasts., and the stimulation of and migration of inflammatory cells. Thus, compounds of formula (I) inhibit pathological inflammatory and fibrotic responses and possess the therapuetical utility of treating and/or preventing disorders or diseases for which reduction of TGFß and/or activin activity is desirable (e.g., various types of fibrosis or progressive cancers).<br>
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, the invention features compounds of formula (I), which exhibit surprisingly high affinity for the TGFß family type I receptors, Alk 5 and/or Alk 4.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a number of known methods from commercially available or known starting materials. In one method, compounds of formula (I) are prepared according to Scheme 1 below. Specifically, a starting compound of formula (II) (where R2 has been selected beforehand) can be methylated in the presence of methyl iodide under a basic condition (e.g., aq. NaOH) to yield form a compound of formula (III), which can be deprotonated under appropriate conditions (e.g., using sodium hexamethyldisilazane (NaHMDS) in THF). Reaction<br>
of the deprotonated compound of formula (III) with a compound of formula (IV) (where R1 has been selected beforehand) leads to an adduct compound of formula (V). The adduct is then brominated and then cyclize with an amino-subsituted heterocycle of formula (VI) to yield a compound of formula (I).<br>
Scheme 1(Scheme Removed)<br>
Referring to Scheme 2 below, the thioether-substituted compound of formula (I) (see end product in Scheme 1) can be further modified to form other compounds of formula (I). Note that each of RA and RB represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, (heterocycloalkyl)alkyl., heteroaryl, or heteroaralkyl.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to Scheme 3 below. Specifically, a compound of formula (VII) can cyclize with an amino-substituted heterocycle of formula (VI) to yield a compound of formula (VIII), which can be brominated to form a compound of formula (IX). Compounds of formula (IX) and formula (X) can undergo a Suzuki coupling reaction to yield a compound of formula (I), which can be further modified to form other compounds of formula (I). See the animation reaction as illustrated in the last step of Scheme 3 above (each of RA and RB having the same meaning as provided above). For preparation of a compound of formula (X), see WO 02/16359.<br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Alternatively, a bromo-substituted compound of formula (I) can be modified to other compounds of formula (I) according to Scheme 4 below.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Alternatively, an amino-substituted compound of formula (I) can be modified to other compounds of formula (I) according to Scheme 5 below, where Rc represents alkyl, cycloalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, (heterocycloalkyl)alkyl, heteroaryl, or heteroaralkyl.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
It should be noted that the methods illustrated in Schemes above are merely examples. One skilled in the art can easily modify these methods to produce compounds of formula (I) other than those shown in the Schemes. For example, one can replace the mono(methylsulfanyl)-substituted compound of formula (III) in Scheme 1 with a di(methylsulfanyl)-substituted derivative (e.g., 4-methyl-2,6-bis-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine, which can be prepared according to, e.g., Aust. J. Chem. 34:1729 (1981), Syn. Commun. 10:791 (1980), or Synthesis 70-72 (1988)), thus resulting in various di-substituted compounds of formula (I) (i.e., disubstituted derivatives of compounds of formula (I) as shown in Schemes 1 and 2).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the molecular weight of the inventive compound is no more than 1200. In another embodiment of the invention the molecular weight is no more than 1000.<br>
As will be obvious to a skilled person in the art, some intermediates may need to be protected before undergoing synthetic steps as described above. For suitable protecting groups, see, e.g., T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1981).<br>
Uses of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
As discussed above, hyperactivity of the TGFß family signaling pathways can result in excess deposition of extracellular matrix and increased inflammatory responses, which can then lead to fibrosis in tissues and organs (e.g., lung, kidney, and liver) and ultimately result in organ failure. See, e.g., Border, W. A. and Ruoslahti E. J. din. Invest. 90: 1-7 (1992) and Border, W. A. and Noble, N. A. N. Engl. J. Med 331: 1286-1292 (1994). Studies have been shown that the expression of TGFß and/or activin mRNA and the level of TGFß and/or activin are increased in patients suffering from various fibrotic disorders, e.g., fibrotic kidney diseases, alcohol-induced and autoimmune hepatic fibrosis, myelofibrosis, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
Compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFß family type I receptors, Alk 5 and/or Alk 4, and inhibit TGFß and/or activin signaling pathway, are therefore useful for treating and/or preventing fibrotic disorders or diseases mediated by an increased level of TGFß and/or activin activity. As used herein, a compound inhibits the TGFß family signaling pathway when it binds (e.g., with an IC50 value of less than 10 µM; preferably, less than 1 µM; more preferably, less than 0.1 µM) to a receptor of the pathway (e.g., Alk 5 and/or Alk 4), thereby competing with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor and reducing the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to the endogenous ligand or substrate binding. The aforementioned disorders or diseases include any conditions (a) marked by the presence of an abnormally high level of TGFß and/or activin; and/or (b) an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix; and/or (c) an increased number and synthetic activity of myofibroblasts. These disorders or diseases include, but are not limited to, fibrotic conditions such as scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy,<br>
lupus nephritis, hypertension-induced nephropathy, ocular or corneal scarring, hepatic or biliary fibrosis, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, post-infarction cardiac fibrosis, fibrosclerosis, fibrotic cancers, fibroids, fibroma, fibroadenomas, and fibrosarcomas.  Other fibrotic conditions for which preventive treatment with compounds of formula (I) can have therapeutic utility include radiation therapy-induced fibrosis, chemotherapy-induced fibrosis, surgically induced scarring including surgical adhesions, laminectomy, and coronary restenosis.<br>
Increased TGFß activity is also found to manifest in patients with progressive cancers.  Studies have shown that in late stages of various cancers, both the tumor cells and the stromal cells within the tumors generally overexpress TGFß. This leads to stimulation of angiogenesis and cell motility, suppression of the immune system, and increased interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix. See, e.g., Hojo, M. et al., Nature 397: 530-534 (1999). As a result, the tumors cells become more invasive and metastasize to distant organs.  See, e.g., Maehara, Y. et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 17: 607-614 (1999) and Picon, A. et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1: 497-504 (1998). Thus, compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFß type I receptor and inhibit TGFß signaling pathway, are also useful for treating and/or preventing various late stage cancers which overexpress TGFß. Such late stage cancers include carcinomas of the lung, breast, liver, biliary tract, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, pancreas, prostate, cervix as well as multiple myeloma, melanoma, glioma, and glioblastomas.<br>
Importantly, it should be pointed but that because of the chronic and in some cases localized nature of disorders or diseases mediated by overexpression of TGFß and/or activin (e.g., fibrosis or cancers), small molecule treatments (such as treatment disclosed in the present invention) are favored for long-term treatment.<br>
Not only are compounds of formula (I) useful in treating disorders or diseases mediated by high levels of TGFß and/or activin activity, these compounds can also be used to prevent the same disorders or diseases. It is known that polymorphisms leading to increased TGFß and/or activin production have been associated with fibrosis and hypertension. Indeed, high serum TGFß levels are correlated with the<br>
development of fibrosis in patients with breast cancer who have received radiation therapy, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, veno-occlusive disease in transplant recipients, and peritoneal fibrosis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Thus, the levels of TGFß and/or activin in serum and of TGFß and/or activin mRNA in tissue can be measured and used as diagnostic or prognostic markers for disorders or diseases mediated by overexpression of TGFß and/or activin, and polymorphisms in the gene for TGFß that determine the production of TGFß and/or activin can also be used in predicting susceptibility to disorders or diseases.

Administration of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
As defined above, an effective amount is the amount which is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. For a compound of formula (I), an effective amount can range from about 1 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg (e.g., from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg). Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, dependant on route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments including use of other therapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be administered in any manner suitable for the administration of pharmaceutical compounds, including, but not limited to, pills, tablets, capsules, aerosols, suppositories, liquid formulations for ingestion or injection or for use as eye or ear drops, dietary supplements, and topical preparations. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions include aqueous solutions of the active agent, in a isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins, or other solubilizing agents well-known to those familiar with the art, can be utilized as pharmaceutical<br>
excipients for delivery of the therapeutic compounds. As to route of administration, the compositions can be administered orally, intranasally, transdermally, intradermally, vaginally, intraaurally, intraocularly, buccally, rectally, transmucosally, or via inhalation, implantation (e.g., surgically), or intravenous administration. The compositions can be administered to an animal (e.g., a mammal such as a human, non-human primate, horse, dog, cow, pig, sheep, goat, cat, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, hamster, gerbil, ferret, lizard, reptile, or bird).<br>
Optionally, compounds of formula (I) can be administered in conjunction with one or more other agents that inhibit the TGFß signaling pathway or treat the corresponding pathological disorders (e.g., fibrosis or progressive cancers) by way of a different mechanism of action. Examples of these agents include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroid, steroid anti-inflammatory agents, and chemotherapeutics or radiation, as well as agents that antagonize ligand binding or activation of the TGFß receptors, e.g., anti-TGFß, anti-TGFß receptor antibodies, or antagonists of the TGFß type II receptors.<br>

Example 113<br>
Cell-Free Assay for Evaluating Inhibition of Autophosphorylation of TGFß Type<br>
I Receptor<br>
The serine-threonine kinase activity of TGFß type I receptor was measured as the autophosphorylation activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor containing an N-terminal poly histidine, TEV cleavage site-tag, e.g., His-TGFßRI. The His-tagged receptor cytoplasmic kinase domains were purified from infected insect cell cultures using the Gibco-BRL FastBac HTb baculovirus expression system.<br>
To a 96-well Nickel FlashPlate (NEN Life Science, Perkin Elmer) was added 20 µl of 1.25 µCi 33P-ATP/25 [M ATP in assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MnCl2, 2% glycerol, and 0.015%Brij 35).  10 µl of test compounds of formula (I) prepared in 5% DMSO solution were added to the FlashPlate. The assay was then initated with the addition of 20 ul of assay buffer containing 12.5 pmol of His-TGFßRI to each well. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and the reactions were then terminated by a single rinse with TBS. Radiation from each well of the plates was read on a TopCount (Packard). Total binding (no inhibition) was defined as counts measured in the presence of DMSO solution containing with no test compound and non-specific binding was defined as counts measured in the presence of EDTA or no-kinase control.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction performed using the above reagents and incubation conditions but in a microcentrifuge tube was analyzed by separation on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel and the incorporation of radiolabel into the 40 kDaHis-TGFDRI SDS-PAGE band was quantitated on a Storm Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited IC50 values of less than 10 µM; some exhibited IC50 values of less than 0.1 µM.<br>
Example 114<br>
Inhibition of the Activin type I receptor (Alk 4) kinase autophosphorylation activity by test compounds of formula (I) can be determined in a similar manner as described above in Example 7 except that a similarly His-tagged form of Alk 4 (His-Alk 4) was used in place of the His-TGFßRL<br>
Example 115<br>
Assay for Evaluating Cellular Inhibition of TGFß Signaling and Cytotoxicity<br>
Biological activity of compounds of formula (I) were determined by measuring their ability to inhibit TGFß-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells.<br>
HepG2 cells were stably transfected with the PAl-luciferase reporter grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 fig/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and non essential amino acids (Ix). The transfected cells were then plated at a concentration of 2.5 x 104 cells/well in 96 well plates and starved for 3-6 hours in media with 0.5% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then stimulated with ligand either 2.5 ng/ml TGFß in the starvation media containing 1% DMSO and the presence or absence of test compounds of of formula (I) and incubated as described above for 24 hours. The media was washed out in the following day and the luciferase reporter activity was detected using the LucLite Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Packard, cat. no. 6016911) as recommended. The plates were read on a Wallac Microbeta plate reader, the reading of which was used to determine the IC50 values of compounds of formula (I) for inhibiting TGFß-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells. Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited IC50 values of less 10 uM.<br>
Cytotoxicity was determined using the same cell culture conditions as described above. Specifically, cell viability was determined after overnight incubation with the CytoLite cell viability kit (Packard, cat. no. 6016901). Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited LD25 values greater than 10 µM.<br>
Example 116<br>
Assay for Evaluating Cellular Inhibition of TGFß Signaling<br>
The cellular inhibition of activin signaling activity by test compounds of formula (I) were determined in a similar manner as described above in Example 115 except that l00ng/ml of activin is added to serum starved cells in place of the 2.5ng/ml TGFß<br>
Example 117<br>
Assay for TGFß-Induced Collagen Expression<br>
Preparation of Immortalized Collagen Promotor-Green Fluorescent Protein Cells Fibroblasts were derived from the skin of adult transgenic mice expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the control of the collagen 1 Al promoter (see Krempen, K. et al., Gene Exp. 8: 151-163 (1999)). Cells were immortalised with a temperature sensitive large T antigen that is active at 33°C. Cells are expanded at 33°C then transferred to 37°C so that the large T becomes inactive (see Xu, S. et al., Exp. Cell Res. 220: 407-414 (1995)). Over the course of about 4 days and one split, the cells cease proliferating. Cells are then frozen in aliquots sufficient for a single 96 well plate. Assay of TGFß-induced Collagen-GFP Expression<br>
Cells are thawed, plated in complete DMEM (contains nonessential amino acids, ImM sodium pyruvate and 2mM L-glutamine) with 10 % fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% C02. The following day, the cells aretrypsinized<br>
and transferred into 96 well format with 30,000 cells per well in 50 µ1 complete DMEM containing 2 % fetal calf serum, but without phenol red. The cells are incubated at 37°C for 3 to 4 hours to allow them to adhere to the plate, solutions containing test compounds of formula (I) are then added to triplicate wells with no TGFß, as well as triplicate wells with 1 ng/ml TGFß. DMSO was also added to all of the wells at a final concentration of 0.1%. GFP fluorescence emission at 530 nm following excitation at 485 nm was measured at 48 hours after the addition of solution containing test compounds on a CytoFluor microplate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems). The data are then expressed as the ratio of TGFß-induced to non-induced for each test sample.<br>
