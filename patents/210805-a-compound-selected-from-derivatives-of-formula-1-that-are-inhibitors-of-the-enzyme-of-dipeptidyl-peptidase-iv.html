				<td>Field Of Invention<br>
The present invention relaters to a compound selected from derivatives of<br><br>
formula 1 that are inhibitors of the enzyme of dipeptidyl peptidase IV.<br>
Background<br>
The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV, herein abbreviated DP-IV (and elsewhere as DAP-IV or DPP-IV) and also known by the classification EC.3. 4.14.5, is a serine protease that cleaves the N-terminal dipeptide from peptides that begin with the sequence H-Xaa-Pro (where Xaa is any amino acid, although preferably a lipophilic one, and Pro is proline). It will also accept as substrates peptides that begin with the sequence H-Xaa-Ala (where Ala is alanine). DP-IV was first identified as a membrane-bound protein. More recently a soluble form has been identified.<br>
Initial interest in DP-iV focussed on its role in the activation of T lymphocytes. DP-IV is identical to the T cell protein CD26. It was proposed that inhibitorsof DP-IV would be capable of modulating T cell responsiveness, and so could be developed as novel immunomodulators. It was further suggested that CD26 was a necessary co-receptor for HIV, and thus that DP-IV inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of AIDS.<br>
Attention was given to the role of DP-IV outside the immune system. It was recognised that DP-IV has a key role in the degradation of several peptide hormones, including growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and glucagonlike peptide-1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2). Since GLP-1 is known to have a potentiating effect on the action of insulin in the control of post-prandial blood glucose levels it is clear that DP-IV inhibitors might also be usefully employed in the treatment of type 11 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. At least two DP-IV inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials to explore this possibility.<br><br>
Several groups have disclosed inhibitors of DP-IV. While some leads have been found from random screening programs, the majority of the work in this field has been directed towards the investigation of substrate analogs. Inhibitors of DP-IV that are substrate analogs are disclosed in, for example, US 5,462,928, US 5,543,396, WO 95/15309 (equivalent to US 5,939,560 and EP 0731789), WO 98/19998 (equivalent to US 6,011,155),<br>
W099/46272 and .W099/61431. The most potent inhibitors are aminoacyf pyrrolidine boronic acids, but these are unstable and tend to cyclise, while the more stable pyrrolidine and thiazolidine derivatives have a lower affinity for the enzyme and so would require large doses in a clinical situation. Pyrrolidine nitriles appear to offer a good compromise since they have both a high affinity for the enzyme and a reasonably long half-life in solution as the free base. -There remains, however, a need for inhibitors of DP-IV with improved properties.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a series of inhibitors of DP-IV with improved affinity for the enzyme. The compounds can be used for the treatment of a number of human diseases, including impaired glucose tolerance and type II diabetes. Accordingly, the invention further relates to the use of the compounds in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, to such compositions per Se, and to the use of such compositions in human therapy. The compounds of the invention are described by general formula 1.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br><br>
In a first aspect, the present invention comprises a series 6f novel compounds. that are inhibitors of the enzyme DP-IV and are useful for the treatment of certain human diseases. The compounds are described by general formula I.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In general formula I, X1 is a divalent group selected from a sulphur atom (—5-), an oxygen atom (-0-), a suiphinyl group (-SO-), a suiphonyl group (-SOT) and a methylene group (-OH,.-). X2 is a divalent group selected from an oxygen atom (—0-), a sulphur atom (-5-) and a methylene group (—OH,.-). X3 is either a substituted imino group (-NR5-) or a carbonyl (&gt;0=0) or thiocarbonyl (&gt;0=5) group.<br><br>
R' is either a hydrogen atom (H) or a nitrile group (-ON).<br><br>
R2 and R3 may each independently of the other be a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, or together they may be a chain of between two and five methylene units (-(OH,.)~- where p is in the range 2 — 5) so as to form, with the carbon atom to which they are attached, a three,-four, five or six-membered ring. The value of m may be 1, 2 or 3. When m is greater than I then each 0R2R3 unit may be the same or different. For example, when m is 2 then (0R2R3),. may be OH,.OH,., OH,.O(Me),., O(Me),.OH,. and the like.<br><br>
The nature of R4 depends on the identity of X3, such that the two groups are linked by an amide (CO-N), thioamide (05-N) or sulphonamide (SO,..-N) bond. So, when X8 is a substituted imino group (-NR5-) then R4 is ~ where R4A is selected from carbamoyl groups (R6R7NC(=O)), thiocarbamoyl groups (R6R7NO(=S)); optionally modified acyl groups (RNOI~l~)qO(=O)), optionally modified thioacyl groups (R8(CH2)qOQ~S)), sulphonyl<br>
groups (R8(CHz)qSO2), optionally modified (alkyl or aryloxy)carbonyl groups (R8(CH2)qOO(0)) and optionally modified (alkyl or aryloxy)thiocarbonyl groups(R8(CH,.)qOC(=S)). As used herein, the tern, "optionally modified" is taken to indicate that some embodiments of R8 are beyond the scope of the terms '~alkyl~, "acyr and "aryl". The scope of the definition of R'~ is determined by the scope of the definition of RB. Alternatively, when X3 is a carbonyl (&gt;0=0) or thiocarbonyl (&gt;C~S) group then R4 is R48, where R4B is a substituted amino group (R8R7N).<br>
R5 is a hydrogen atom (H) or a tower alkyl group. Preferably, R5 is H.<br>
R8 and R7 may each independently of the other be R8(CH2)q. Alternatively, they may together be a group —(OH,.),.-Z1-(CH,.),.- or —CHR9-Z2-CH,.--OR'0-. Here Z' is a covalent bond, a methylene or ethylidene group (-(OH~- where r is I or 2), an oxygen atom (-0-), a sulphur or oxidised sulphur atom (-SOr where t is zero, I or 2) or a substituted imino group (~N((CH2)qR8)), such that the group NR6R7 is a pyrrolidine, piperidine, perhydroazepine, morpholine, optionally oxidised thiomorpholine or substituted piperazine ring. Z2 is an ortho-phenylene moiety (—C6H4--), such that the group NR6R7 is a tetrahydroisoquinoline.<br><br>
R8 is selected from a hydrogen atom (H), a lower alkyl group, a benzo-fused lower cycloalkyl group (such as an indanyl group), an acyl (lower alkyl-CO) group, a di(lower alkyl)amino group, a di(lower alkyl)carbamoyl group, an N-(lower aIkyl)piperidinyl group, an optionally substitiued a-alkylbenzyl group, an optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or heteroaryl group, and an optionally substituted aroyl (aryl-CO) or arylsulphonyl (aryl-S02) group. In the foregoing, suitable optional substituents are lower alkyl, aryl which may be further substituted with one or more methyl or trifluoromethyl groups, hydroxy, lower alkyloxy, lower alkylsulphonyl, acyl, perfiuoroacyl, amino, lower alkylamino, di(lower alkyl)amino, aminoalkylene, fluoro, chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, carbamoyl, carboxy and lower aikyloxycarbonyl groups. In addition, two adjacent substituents may be linked so as to form a ring fused to the parent aryl or heteroaryl ring.<br><br>
R9 and R10 are independently selected from hydrogen, carbamoyl, hydroxymethyl and cyanomethyl groups.<br>
The integer n is selected from the range zero to 4, and q is selected from the range zero to<br>
3.<br>
Certain compounds are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. When X2 is methylene, X3 is NH and R4 is R8(CHz)qO(CO), with q = , then R8 may not be unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl substituted with a nitro group. It is generally preferred that when X2 is methylene, X3 is NH, R4 is R8(CH2)qQ(OO), q is I and RB is a substituted phenyl group then the substituent or substituents should be selected from chloro, methoxy and trifluoromethyl groups.<br><br>
In the context of the present disclosure, the term lower alkyl, either by itself or in such combinations as lower alkyloxy, is intended to comprise linear, branched and cyclic saturated hydrocarbon groups of between one and six carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentylmethyl, 2-(cyclopropyl)ethyl, 3,3-dimethylcyclobutyl and bicyclo[3. 1 .Ojhexyl.<br><br>
The term heteroaryl includes monocyclic five- and six-membered ring aromatic groups with one or two heteroatoms, which are selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. Thus, heteroaryl groups include pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, furyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl and isoxazolyl. Heteroaryl further includes the benzofused derivatives of these rings, such as quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, phthalazinyl, cinnolinyt, indolyl, isoindofyf, benzothiazolyl and the like, and bicyclic groups formed by the fusion of two such monocyclic heteroaromatic groups.<br><br>
The term aryl includes phenyl, naphthyl and heteroaryl.<br><br>
The compounds of general formula I have at least one stereogenic centre and so can exhibit optical isomerism. All such isomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers and epimers are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the invention includes such compounds as single isomers and as ~mixtures, including racemates. Certain compounds according to general formula, including those with a heteroaryl group which carries a hydroxy or amino substituent, can exist as tautomers. These tautomers, either separately or as mixtures, are also considered to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds according to general formula I have at least one basic functional group. They can therefore form addition salts with acids. Those addition salts that are formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids are included within 'the scope of the invention. Examples of suitable acids include acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, benzoic acid, pamoic acid, methanesulphonic acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like.<br><br>
Certain compounds according to general formula I have an acidic group and so are able to form salts with bases. Examples of such salts include the sodium, potassium and calcium salts, which are formed by the reaction of the acid with the corresponding metal hydroxide, oxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. Similarly, tetra-alkyl ammonium salts may be formed by the reaction of the acid with a tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide. Primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, can form addition salts with the acid. A particular case of this would be an internal addition salt formed between an acidic group and the primary amine group of the same molecule, which is also called a zwitterion. Insofar as they are pharmaceutically acceptable, all these salts are included within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention R1 is a nitrile group. Within this embodiment, it is preferred that the stereochemistry of the nitrile group is as shown in general formula 2.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to the standard terminology, this is the S configuration when X' is methylene but the R configuration when X1 is sulphur, oxygen, sulphinyl or sulphonyl.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, the stereochemistry at the centre adjacent to the primary amine is as shown in general formula 3. This is the S configuration when X2 is an oxygen atom or a methylene or imino group, and the R configuration when X2 is a sulphur atom.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Within this embodiment, it is more preferred that R1 should be a nitrile group, and more preferred still that it should have the absolute configuration depicted in general formula 4.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, m is 1. More preferably m is I and R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen atoms or methyl groups. When X2 is a methylene group, it is more preferred that R2 and R3 both be hydrogen. When X2 is an oxygen atom, it is more preferred that one of R2 and R3 be hydrogen and the other a methyl group. When X2 is a sulphur atom, it is more preferred that both R2 and R3 be methyl groups.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, X1 is either S or methylene. More preferably, X1 is S and R' is H, or K1 is methylene and R1 is CN.<br><br>
In another preferred embodirnent, X3 is NH. More preferably. X3 is NH, m is 1, R2 and R3 are both H, X2 is methylene and n is I or 2.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, R4 is R8NHCO or R800 and R8 is an optionally substituted heteroaryl group. More preferably, R5 is an unsubstituted heteroaryl group, or a heteroaryl group substituted with one or two groups chosen from lower alkyl, lower alkyloxy, fluoro, chioro and trifluoromethyl groups.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, X3 is 00 and R4 is R6NH. More preferably R8 is an optioriaUy substituted heteroaryl' group. More preferably still, R5 is an unsubstituteci heteroaryl group, or a heteroaryl group substituted with one or two groups chosen from lower alkyl, lower alkyloxy, fluoro, chloro and trifluoromethyl groups.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, X3 is NH and R4 is selected from R6R7N(O0), R8(0H2)qCO and R8(CH2)q502.<br><br>

In a second aspect, the present invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition for human therapeutic use. The composition is charactetised in that it has, as an active agent, at least one of the compounds described above. Such a composition is useful in the treatment of human diseases. The composition will generally include one or more additional components selected from pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and pharmaceutically active agents other than those of the present invention.<br><br>
The composition may be presented as a solid or liquid formulation, depending on the intended route of administration. Examples of solid formulations include pills, tablets, capsules and powders for oral administration, suppositories for rectal or vaginal .administration, powders for nasal or pulmonary administration, and patches for transdermal or transmucosal (such as buccal) administration. Examples of liquid formulations include solutions and suspensions for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection and oral, nasal or pulmonary administration. A particularly<br>
preferred presentation is a tablet for oral administration. Another preferred presentation, particularly for emergency and critical care, is a sterile solution for intravenous injection.<br><br>
The composition comprises at least one compound according to the preceding description. The composition may contain more than one such compound, but in general it is preferred that it should comprise only one. The amount of the compound used in the composition will be such that the total daily dose of the active agent can be administered in one to four convenient dose units. For example, the composition can be a tablet containing an amount of compound equal to the total daily dose necessary, said tablet to be taken once per day. Alternatively, the tablet can contain half (or one third, or one quarter) of the daily dose, to be taken twice (or three or four times) per day. Such a tablet can also be scored to facilitate divided dosing, so that, for example, a tablet comprising a full daily dose can be broken into half and administered in two portions. Preferably, a tablet or other unit dosage form will contain between 0.1mg and Ig of active compound. More preferably, it will contain between 1mg and 250mg.<br><br>
The composition will generally include one or more excipients selected from those that are recognised as being pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, bulking agents, binding agents, diluents, solvents, preservatives and flavouring agents. Agents that modify the release characteristics of the composition, such as polymers that selectively dissolve in the intestine ("enteric coatings") are also considered in the context of the present invention, to be suitable excipients.<br><br>
The composition may comprise, in addition to the compound of the invention, a second pharmaceutically active agent. For example, the composition may include an anti-diabetic agent, a growth-promoting agent, an anti-inflammatory agent or an antiviral agent However, it is generally preferred that the composition comprise only one active agent<br><br>
In a third aspect, the invention comprises a use for the compounds and compositions described above for the treatment of human diseases. This aspect can equally be considered to comprise a method of treatment for such, diseases. The diseases susceptible to treatment are those wherein an inhibition of DP-IV or CD26 results in a clinical benefit either directly or indirectly. Direct effects include the blockade of T lymphocyte activation. indirect effects include the potentiation of peptide hormone activity by preventing the degradation of these hormones. Examples of diseases include, but are<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
not limited to, auto-immune and inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, growth hormone deficiency leading to short stature, polycystic ovary syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Particularly preferred is the use of the compounds and compositions for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, and equally a method of treatment of these diseases by the administration of an effective amount of a compound or composition as previously described.<br><br>
The precise details of the treatment, including the dosing regimen, will be established by the attending physician taking into account the general profile of the patient and the severity of the disease. For diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease that have acute phases of active disease separated by quiescent periods, the physician may select a relatively high dose during the acute phase and a tower maintenance dose for the quiescent period. For chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, the dosing may need to be maintained at the same level for an extended period. A dosing schedule of one to four tablets per day, each comprising between 0.1mg and Ig (and preferably between 1mg and 250mg) of active compound might be typical in such a case.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. The route chosen will depend on the particular nature of the substituents present in the target molecule. In the following general description the synthetic route is outlined for compounds wherein m is 1. Compounds with m = 2 or 3 can generally be prepared by analogous routes.<br><br>
The starting material will usually be an c,co-diamino acid derivative 5 or an amino dicarboxylic acid derivative 6.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
PG' and PG2 are "orthogonal" protecting groups — groups that mask the reactivity of the amine groups and that can each be selectively removed in the presence of the other. Suitable groups are well known in the literature. PG3 and PG4 are protecting groups for carboxylic acids. They are chosen such that they are orthogonal to each other and to the amino protecting groups. Suitable possibilities for PG3 and PG4 are also well known in the literature. Derivatives of diamino acids according to general formula 5 and derivatives of amino dicarboxylic acids according to general formula 6 are either items of commerce, or can be prepared following methods described in the literature. In practice, and depending on the strategy chosen, the starting material will have only two of the three protecting groups present. Either PG3 will be absent to allow the pyrrolidine (or thiazolidine or oxazolidine) residue to be introduced, or PG' or PG4 will be absent to allow the side chain to be elaborated.<br><br>
Scheme A illustrates the introduction of the pyrrolidine (or thiazolidine or oxazolidine) group as the first step in the preparation of the compounds of the invention.<br><br>
Scheme A (Scheme Removed)<br>
Compounds 5A and 6A correspond to 5 and 6 with PG3 as a hydrogen atom (i.e. without the protecting group). The free carboxylic acid can be reacted with a pyrrolidine derivative 7 to give the amide 8 or 9. Reaction conditions for achieving this transformation are well<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
known in the literature. Suitable reagents include carbodiimides, phosphorus reagents and alkyl chloroformates, and the reaction is usually catalysed by a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or dimethylaminopyridine.<br><br>
The reaction depicted in Scheme A is available for all combinations of R1 and K'. However, for the case where R' is a nitnle group, or where K' is a sulphinyl or sulphonyl group, it may be advantageous to modify the strategy as depicted in Schemes B and 0.<br><br>
Scheme B (Scheme Removed)<br>
ln Scheme B, the R1 group is introduced as a primary amide and subsequently transformed into a nitrile by the action of a dehydrating agent such as trifluoroacetic anhydulde. In Scheme C, the K' group is introduced as a thioether and subsequently transformed into a sulphoxide (a=1) or sulphone (a=2) by the action of an oxidant such as sodium periodate. The modification to the strategy afforded by Scheme C is not possible if X2 is a sulphur atom.<br><br>
Scheme D (Scheme Removed)<br><br>
ln Scheme D, compound 5D is the diamino acid derivative 5 where the a-protecting group is a hydrogen atom. The free amine group reacts readily with sulphonyl chlorides, acyl chlorides and thicacyl chlorides, usually in the presence of a tertiary amine. to produce sulphonarnides 14, amides 15 and thicamides 16 respectively. The reagents are generally either available per se, or can be prepared from the corresponding acids. The reaction of scheme D is generally applicable to all the variations of the group R8(CI~l2)q, with the proviso that certain of the substituents contemplated for the phenyl and heteroaryl rings which are options for RB may require, protection. Such substituents and the appropriate protection will generally be obvious to those familiar with the art.<br>

Scheme E illustrates the elaboration of 50 to give carbamates and ureas, and their thio analogues. When R5 is other than a hydrogen atom, compound ~D can be converted to the corresponding carbamoyl chloride 17 or thiocarbamoyl chloride 18 by reaction with phosgene or thiophosgene. Other reagents are known in the art to be functionally equivalent to these toxic reagents and they may also be used. When R5 is hydrogen, the intermediate formed is an isocyanate or isothiocyanate, but this behaves functionally as an equivalent of the corresponding chloride. Intermediates 17 and 18 are not normally isolated, but are treated directly with alcohols to give carbamates 19 and thiocarbamates<br><br>
20.	Treatment of these same intermediates with amines leads to the formation of ureas<br>
21 and thioureas 22. Alternatively, 50 may be reacted directly with a chloroformate or chlorothioformate to give the carbamate or thiocarbamate, or, when neither R6 nor R7 is hydrogen, with a chloroformamide or chlorothioformamide to give the urea or thiourea. When R6 or R7 is a hydrogen atom the chloroformamide or chlorothioformamide will tend to be unstable, in which case the isocyanate (e.g. R8-NCO) or isothiocyanate (e.g. R8-NCS) is used. As discussed previously for Scheme D, certain substituents within the embodiments of RB may require appropriate protection.<br><br>
Scheme F(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme F illustrates the elaboration of the side chain of the amino dicarboxylic acid series. The ~-deprotected acid 6F can be reacted under a variety of conditions with an amine to give amide 23. The condensation may be promoted by a dehydrating reagent such as a carbodiimide or a phosphorus reagent. Alternatively the acid may be converted into a more reactive derivative, such as by treatment with oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride to give the corresponding acid chloride, which will react directly with an amine. The thicamide 24 may be obtained by treating the amide 23 with Lawesson's reagent<br>
When all the groups have been elaborated the final protecting group is removed and the product is isolated and purified using standard techniques.<br><br>
These general methods are further illustrated in the following, non limiting examples.<br>

EXAMPLE 451<br>
Determination of activity<br><br>
Oompounds were assayed as inhibitors of DP-IV according to the methods described in W095/1 5309. All the compounds described in the foregoing Examples were competitive inhibitors of DP-IV with 1'~ values less than 300nM.<br>
EXAMPLE 452<br>
Determination of activity in vivo<br>
The anti-diabetic action of selected compounds was demonstrated in Zucker obese rats using a standard oral glucose tolerance test. Oontrol rats were given a solution of glucose by oral gavage, and plasma glucose levels were determined. These rats demonstrated a significant hyperglycaemia. Oompounds according to the present invention were dissolved in glucose solution at various concentrations, such that the rats could be given <br>
varying doses of the compound simultaneously with the glucose challenge. The hyperglycaeinic excursion was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in animals receiving between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg of DP-IV inhibitor.<br>
EXAMPLE 453<br>
Pharmaceutical formulation<br><br>
Tablets containing 100mg of the compound of Example I as the active agent are prepared from the following:<br>
	Oompound of Example I	200.Og<br>
	Oorn starch	71.Og<br>
	Hydroxypropylcellulose	18.Og<br>
	Oarboxymethylcellulose calcium	13.Og<br>
	Magnesium stearate	3.Og<br>
	Lactose	195.Og<br>
	     Total	500. Og<br><br>
The materials are blended and then pressed to give 2000 tablets of 250mg, each containing 100mg of the compound of Example 1.<br>
