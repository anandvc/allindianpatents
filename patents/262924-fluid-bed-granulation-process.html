1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the field of animal health. In particular, the invention relates to novel oral pharmaceutical compositions comprising as pharmaceutically active compounds pimobendan.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Pimobendan (4,5-dihydro-6-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazone) is disclosed in EP 008 391 B1, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Pimobendan is a cardiotonic, hypotensive and anti-thrombotic. Said substance is the standard in the indication congestive heart failure.<br>
Pimobendan only hardly dissolves in water. The resorption of pimobendan when administered orally is prone to considerable inter- and intra-individual fluctuations if the active substance is incorporated in known or conventional pharmaceutical forms for oral administration. The reason for this is that pimobendan is characterized by a low solubility in aqueous media and a very highly pH-dependent solubility. To overcome this, hard gelatine capsules were used containing pimobendan formulated with citric acid, in particular at a weight ratio of pimobendan to citric acid of between 1:10 and 1:20 (EP 439 030 B1, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). However, the high quantity of citric acid and the acidic taste of citric acid is not voluntarily accepted by most animals - thus, such capsules have to be force-fed to the animals or mixed with food prior to application.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention was to provide a pimobendan solid formulation voluntarily acceptable by mammalian subjects, especially small animals.<br>
2. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to novel solid formulations comprising as pharmaceutically active compound pimobendan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is homogenously dispersed in a polyvalent acid and a flavor acceptable to small animals.

Thus, for example, reference to "a tablet" includes a plurality of such tablets, reference to the "carrier" is a reference to one or more carriers and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All given ranges and values may vary by 1 to 5% unless indicated otherwise or known otherwise by the person skilled in the art, therefore, the term "about" was omitted from the description. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing the substances, excipients, carriers, and methodologies as reported in the publications which might be used in connection with the invention. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.<br>
The solution to the above technical problem is achieved by the description and the embodiments characterized in the claims.<br>
To overcome the difficulties in the art, a process was invented. Only the invention of this novel fluid-bed granulation process allowed the formulation of voluntarily acceptable solid formulations according to the invention. With the process according to the invention, it was possible to formulate a voluntarily accepted, long-term stable, large scale producable, homogenously dispersed, fast-releasing solid formulation. Despite the large size, pimobendan was homogenously dispersed. Such solid formulations comprising a flavor suitable for small animals, which surprisingly still allows a formulation comprising a polyvalent acid and yet have a palatibility rate of more than 70%- in many cases more than 90%. Thus, the solid formulations according to the invention are a major step forward in therapeutic application as they do not have to be force-fed to the animal.<br>

granules and/or<br>
g)	the final granules of f) are compressed to solid formulations.<br>
Step g) is omitted if the solid formulation is a granule. If the solid formulation is a tablet, step g) is carried out.<br>
The invention preferably relates to a granule formulation as obtained by the process above that can either be administered in the granular form or as tablets after compressing the final granules to tablets. Therefore, the solid formulation according to the invention preferably is a granule (or a plurality of such granules) or a tablet. The administration of the granules can take place by mixing with food or by offering the granules directly to the animal, e.g. in a bowl. The application of the granular form will allow an individual dosing of pimobendan according to the body weight of the animal.<br>
The tablets according to the invention have surprising advantages. The dissolution profile is ensuring immediate release of pimobendan. Surprisingly, it could be demonstrated that while compressing the final granules as mentioned above, a decrease in the dissolution characteristics is not observed. By ensuring an immediate release profile of pimobendan, the amount of drug to be administered can be kept as low as possible, thereby improving the safety profile especially for long-term treatment.<br>
Furthermore, the dosing accuracy of the tablet is excellent. This is due to the fact that in accordance with the manufacturing process according to this invention, an excellent uniformity of pimobendan content is achieved. Furthermore, the tablets can be broken into two halves so that half the dose per tablet can be administered. Compared with the existing gelatine capsule, the dosing accuracy and compliance of both the animal and the animal owner are assured. This is even more important since the drug is administered for a life-long treatment.<br>
Also, the payability of the tablet is excellent. More than 90 % of the dogs to whom the tablet according to this invention is given, accept the tablet voluntarily with only the tablet offered in a bowl. Compared with the existing gelatine capsule, the<br><br>
compliance of both the animal and the animal owner are significantly improved. This is even more important since the drug is administered for a life-long treatment.<br>
The invention preferably also relates to a tablet according to the invention, characterized in that the tablet is stable for at least 18 months at 25°C and 60% relative humidity. In the examples, testing parameter assays are disclosed for degradation of pimobendan, dissolution, loss on drying, hardness and disintegration of the tablet. The tablets according to the invention are within the specification limits regarding degradation of pimobendan, dissolution, loss on drying, hardness and disintegration.<br>
Suitable packaging materials for tablets according to the invention are selected from, but not limited to: aluminum/aluminum blisters, PVC/PVDC blisters, and HOPE (high density polyethylene bottles).<br>
The invention preferably also relates to a tablet according to the invention, characterized in that the tablet is oblong in shape.
