				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention relates to a one step electrochemical process for the synthesis of pure rutile titanium dioxide nanoneedles with high aspect ratio at room temperature. Further the invention relates to a room temperature process for the synthesis of rutile titanium dioxide nanoneedles.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as rutile, anatase and brookite. Rutile titanium dioxide is widely used as ultraviolet protecting agent, optical coatings, beam splitters and anti-reflection coatings. It can also be used as a humidity sensor and as high-temperature oxygen sensor.<br>
A variety of synthetic procedures have been documented for control on the phase formation and morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles. Usually, these synthetic routes lead to mixture of anatase and rutile polymorphs.<br>
Rutile TiO2 powders are conventionally obtained by phase transformation of anatase to rutile at more than 450 °C or by flame oxidation of TiCl4. These methods result in larger titania particles with lower surface/volume ratio. The alternative to control the phase and size of rutile titania particles involves the use of a precursor along with other mineralizers and inorganic additives, like SnCl4, NH4Cl, NaCl or SnO2 that are difficult to remove and have an undesirable influence in several applications. Controlled synthesis of crystalline rutile nano-TiO2 without using any inorganic additives require higher temperatures, which result in an increase in crystallite size. Low-temperature preparation of nano-rutile TiO2 with higher specific surface area is possible under acidic conditions by hydrothermal synthesis route. But, this process is extremely time consuming, requiring about two-three days with poor yields.<br>
WO2008127508 titled "Titania Nanotubes Prepared By Anodization In Chloride-Containing Electrolytes" by Northeastern University dated 23.10.2008; discloses a method of preparing titania nanotubes on the surface of Ti foil leading to rapid production of titania nanotubes of about 25 nm diameter and high aspect ratio, which can be organized into bundles and tightly packed parallel arrays. This application discloses use of Ti foil as anode and platinum rod as<br>
cathode with an electrolyte solution consisting of chloride ions and the reaction is carried out at room temperature with a pH ranging 1 to 7. But Ex. 4 refers to the X-ray diffraction of TiO2 nanotubes, wherein the as-synthesized samples were amorphous prior to annealing and the annealed samples were predominantly anatase with traces of rutile.<br>
Nakayam et al in "Anodic formation of high aspect ratio titania nanotubes", ECS Meeting Abstracts 502, 819(2006) reported an anodization process for the preparation of anatase TiO2, the material formed by the Nakayama et al process was nanotubes. The nanotubes were formed on the surface of Ti foils.<br>
Juha-Pekka et al in an article titled "The effect of acidity in low-temperature synthesis of titanium dioxide" in Journal of crystal growth 2007, Volume 34, No 1, 179-183 disclose preparation of crystalline titanium dioxide powders by the modified alkoxide method of low temperature. They further state that lower acidity promotes anatase phase, while in case of higher amount of acid the final phase form is rutile.<br>
Aruna et al.in Journal of Materials Science 2000, 10, 2388-2391 and Zhang et al. in Langmuir 2003, 19, 967-971 titled "Preparation of Oxide Nanocrystals with Tunable Morphologies by the Moderate Hydrothermal Method: Insights from Rutile" prepared nanosize rutile titania by hydrothermal and thermal hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH.3)2]) and titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4) respectively.<br>
Pedraza et al. in Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids 60 (1999) 445-448 showed room temperature preparation of high surface area rutile TiO2 using TiCl3 in O2. But the processes followed by Aruna et al and Pedraza et al led to formation of spherical or irregularly shaped rutile titania nanoparticles. Amorphous precipitates of rutile titania nanocrystals have been obtained by hydrothermal treatment or peptization of titanium alkoxide at 433-573 K. Keisuke Nakayam et. al. in Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 11 (3) C23-C26 (2008) have disclosed an anodization process for the preparation of TiO2, which resulted in anatase TiO2 as nanotubes.<br>
Thus we observe that prior art processes to prepare rutile titania are spontaneous, with little or no control on morphology, unless templates are employed. Further, the results of the prior art processes is a mixture of spherical, broom like, or rod-shaped rutile titania. Also, the separation of nanocrystals of any particular morphology from the others is very tedious. Further no prior art process disclose a single-step room temperature process to synthesize rutile titania nanoneedles. Also, the prior art processes suffer from the drawback of having to conduct processes above room temperature, about 50 °C.<br>
Therefore there exists a need from prior art review to evolve a simple, preferably single step process for the synthesis of rutile titanium dioxide at room temperature. There also exists a need to evolve a process for the synthesis of TiO2 with control on morphology.<br>
Also, there exists a need to synthesize rutile titanium dioxide nanoneedles by a simple process that is carried out at room temperature, which results in nanoneedles of high aspect ratios (ratio of length to diameter).<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a one step electrochemical process for the synthesis of pure rutile titanium dioxide nanoneedles with high aspect ratio at room temperature. The process involves application of electric field between a cathode made of noble metal and Ti as anode within a bath comprising of acid and water of desired pH. The nanoneedles of rutile TiO2 are formed by the dissolution of Ti anode. The aspect ratio of the nanoneedles is greater than 10.<br>
