				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing zeolites having the MTT framework topology defined by the connectivity of the tetrahedral atoms in the zeolite using nitrogen-containing organic compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Zeolites having the MTT framework topology defined by the connectivity of the tetrahedral atoms (referred to herein simply as MTT) are known. See, for example, Ch. Baerlocher et al., Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types. 5th Revised Edition, 2001 of the International Zeolite Association. Examples of MTT zeolites include the zeolite designated "SSZ-32". SSZ-32 and methods for making it are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,053,373, issued October 1,1991 to Zones. This patent discloses the preparation of zeolite SSZ-32 using anN-lower alkyl-N1-isopropylimidazolium cation as an organic structure directing agent (SDA), sometimes called a templating agent. U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842, issued February 28, 1978 to Plank et al., discloses the preparation of the zeolite designated "ZSM-23", a zeolite with a structure similar to SSZ-32, using a cation derived from pyrrolidine as the SDA. Zeolites SSZ-32 and ZSM-23 are commonly referred to as having the MTT .framework topology. Both of the aforementioned patents are incorporated herein by reference hi their entirety. Other MTT zeolites include EU-13, ISI-4 and KZ-1.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,707,600, issued January 13,1998 to Nakagawa et al., discloses a process for preparing medium pore size zeolites, including SSZ-32, using small, neutral amines. The amines contain (a) only carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, (b) one primary, secondary or tertiary, but not quaternary, amino group, and (c) a tertiary nitrogen atom, at least one tertiary carbon atom, or a nitrogen atom bonded directly to at least one secondary carbon atom, wherein the process is conducted in the<br><br>
absence of a quaternary ammonium compound. Examples of the small amines include isobutylamine, diisobutylamine, trimethylamine, cyclopentylamine, diisopropylamine, sec-butylamine, 2,5-dimethylpyrrolidine and 2,6-dimethylpiperidine.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,707,601, issued January 13,1998 to Nakagawa, discloses a process for preparing MTT zeolites using small, neutral amines. The amines contain (a) only carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, (b) one primary, secondary or tertiary, but not quaternary, amino group, and (c) a tertiary nitrogen atom, at least one tertiary carbon atom, or a nitrogen atom bonded directly to at least one secondary carbon atom, wherein the process is conducted in the absence of a quaternary ammonium compound. Examples of the small amines include isobutylamine, diisobutylamine, trimethylamine, cyclopentylamine, diisopropylamine, sec-butylamine, 2,5-dimethylpyrrolidine and 2,6-dimethylpiperidine.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,785,947, issued July 28,1998 to Zones et al., discloses that zeolites, including medium pore size, unidimensional zeolites, can be prepared using a mixture of an amine component comprising (1) at least one amine containing one to eight carbon atoms, ammonium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof, and (2) an organic templating compound capable of forming the zeolite hi the presence of the amine component, wherein the amine is smaller than the organic templating compound. Examples of the amines include isopropylamine, isobutylamine, n-butylamine, piperidine, 4-methylpiperidine, cyclohexylamine, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylamine and cyclopentylamine and mixtures of such amines.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,332,566, issued July 26,1994 to Moini, discloses a method of synthesizing ZSM-23 (i.e., MTT) using an organic directing agent having the structure:<br>

In preparing MTT zeolites in accordance with the present invention, the reactants and the nitrogen-containing organic compounds of this invention can be dissolved in water and the resulting reaction mixture maintained at an elevated temperature until crystals are formed. The temperatures during the hydrothermal crystallization step are typically maintained from about 100°C to about 250°C, preferably from about 140°C to about 200°C. The crystallization period is typically 6-21 days, and generally about 7-14 days.<br>
The hydrothermal crystallization is usually conducted under pressure and usually in an autoclave so that the reaction mixture is subject to autogenous pressure. The reaction mixture should be stirred during crystallization.<br>
Once the crystals have formed, the solid product is separated from the reaction mixture by standard mechanical separation techniques, such as filtration. The crystals are water-washed and then dried, e.g., at 90°C to 150°C for from 8 to 24 hours, to obtain the as-synthesized zeolite crystals. The drying step can be performed at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures.<br>
During the hydrothermal crystallization step, the crystals can be allowed to nucleate spontaneously from the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture can also be seeded with crystals of the desired zeolite both to direct, and accelerate the crystallization, as well as to minimize the formation of any undesired crystalline phases. When seed crystals are used, typically about 0.5% to about 5.0% (based on the weight of silica used in the reaction mixture) of the seed crystals of the desired zeolite are added.<br>
Due to the unpredictability of the factors which control nucleation and crystallization in the art of crystalline oxide synthesis, not every combination of reagents, reactant ratios, and reaction conditions will result in crystalline products.<br><br>
Selecting crystallization conditions which are effective for producing crystals may require routine modifications to the reaction mixture or to the reaction conditions, such as temperature, and/or crystallization time. Making these modifications are well within the capabilities of one skilled in the art.<br>
The as-synthesized MTT zeolite product made by the process of this invention has an as-synthesized composition comprising, in terms of mole ratios in the anhydrous state, the following:<br>
YO2WcOd	IS-oo<br>
Q/YO2	0.02 - 0.10<br>
M2/n/YO2	0.015-0.10<br>
wherein Y is silicon; W is aluminum, boron, gallium, indium, iron, titanium, vanadium or mixtures thereof; c is 1 or 2; d is 2 when c is 1 or d is 3 or 5 when c is 2; Q is at least one nitrogen-containing organic compound of this invention; M is an alkali metal cation, alkaline earth metal cation or mixtures thereof; and n is the valence of M. Preferably, Y is silicon, W is aluminum, M is potassium, and Q is SDA A, E or O (SDA A is relatively inexpensive to synthesize, SDA O is more expensive to make than SDA E, but is still relatively easy to synthesize and SDA E crystallizes MTT in a relatively short period of time). It is preferred that the YOa/ WcOd ratio be from about 20 to about 80. In one embodiment of this invention, the Y(V WcODratio is from about 20 to less than 40, and in another embodiment this ratio is greater than 40, e.g., from 40 to about 80.<br>
The MTT zeolites can be made with a mole ratio of YOz/WoOd of oo, i.e., there is essentially no WcOd present in the MTT zeolite. In this case, the zeolite would be an all-silica material. Thus, in a typical case where oxides of silicon and aluminum are used, the MTT zeolite can be made essentially aluminum free, i.e., having a silica to alumina mole ratio of oo. A method of increasing the mole ratio of silica to alumina is by using standard acid leaching or chelating treatments. However, essentially aluminum-free MTT zeolites can be synthesized using essentially aluminum-free silicon sources as the main tetrahedral metal oxide component. The MTT zeolites can also be prepared directly as an aluminosilicate.<br><br><br>
Lower silica to alumina ratios may also be obtained by using methods which insert aluminum into the crystalline framework. For example, aluminum insertion may occur by thermal treatment of the zeolite in combination with an alumina binder or dissolved source of alumina.. Such procedures are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,559,315, issued on December 17,1985 to Chang et al.<br>
Typically, the zeolite is thermally treated (calcined) prior to use as a catalyst.<br>
Usually, it is desirable to remove the alkali metal cation by ion exchange and replace it with hydrogen, ammonium, or any desired metal ion. The zeolite can be leached with chelating agents, e.g., EDTA or dilute acid solutions, to increase the silica/alumina mole ratio. The zeolite can also be steamed; steaming helps stabilize the crystalline lattice to attack from acids. The zeolite can be used in intimate combination with hydrogenating components, such as tungsten, vanadium molybdenum, rhenium, nickel cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal, such as palladium or platinum, for those applications in which a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function is desired. Typical replacing cations can include hydrogen and hydrogen precursors, rare earth metals, and metals from Groups HA, fflA, IVA,  IB,  IIB, IIIB,IVB,V IB, and VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements. Of the replacing cations, hydrogen and cations of metals such as rare earth, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, Ti, Al, Sn, Ga, In and Fe are particularly preferred.<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of Table I is representative of a calcined MTT zeolite (in this case SSZ-32) made in accordance with this invention. Minor variations in the diffraction pattern can result from variations in the silica-to-alumina mole ratio of the particular sample due to changes in lattice constants. In addition, sufficiently small crystals will affect the shape and intensity of peaks, leading to significant peak broadening. The variation in the scattering angle (two theta) measurements, due to instrument error and to differences between individual samples, is estimated at +/- 0.20 degrees.<br>
The X-ray powder diffraction pattern was determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K-alpha/doublet of copper. A diffractometer with a scintillation counter detector was used. The peak heights I and the positions, as a function of 2Theta where Theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the relative intensities, 100 x<br><br>
I/Io where I0 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d, the interplanar spacing in Angstroms corresponding to the recorded lines, can be calculated.<br>

(a)	The X-ray patterns provided are based on a relative intensity scale, in which the<br>
strongest line in the X-ray pattern is assigned a value of 100: W(weak) is less than 20;<br>
M(medium) is between 20 and 40; S(strong) is between 40 and 60; VS(very strong) is<br>
greater than 60.<br>
(b)	These two peaks may have significant overlap, and are sometimes treated as a<br>
single peak.<br><br>
Table IA below shows an X-ray diffraction pattern representative of a calcined MTT zeolite (SSZ-32) made in accordance with this invention. In Table IA, the  • intensity (I) of the peaks or lines is expressed as the intensity relative to the strongest peak or line hi the pattern, i.e., I/Io x 100 where I0 is the intensity of the strongest peak or line.<br>

Calculation can also result in changes in the intensities of the peaks as well as minor shifts in the dif&amp;action pattern. The zeolite produced by exchanging the metal or other cations present in the zeolite with various other cations (such as H* or Nttt4) yields essentially the same dif&amp;action pattern, although again, there may be minor • shifts in the interplanar spacing and variations in the relative Intensities of the peaks. Notwithstanding these minor perturbations, the basic crystal lattice remains unchanged by these treatments.<br>
The MTT zeolites prepared by the process of this invention are useful hi hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Hydrocarbon conversion reactions are chemical and catalytic processes in which carbon-containing compounds are changed to different carbon-containing compounds. Examples of hydrocarbon conversion reactions include catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, dewaxing, alkylation,<br><br>
isomerization, olefin and aromatics formation reactions, and aromatics isomerization and disproportionation.<br>
The following examples demonstrate, but do not limit, the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
There are numerous variations on the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in the Examples which are possible in light of the teachings supporting the present invention. In most syntheses, Reheis F-2000 alumina (53-56 wt%. Al2O3 available from Reheiss Chemical Co.) was used as the aluminum source and potassium tetraborate was used as the boron source. In a few syntheses (stated explicitly in the table), zeolite LZY-52 was used as the aluminum source. SAR = silica to alumina mole ratio and SBR = silica to boron oxide mole ratio. Cabosil M-5 fused silica was used as the silica source. All reactions were performed within a Blue-M convection oven on a spit rotating at 43 rpm. Syntheses were performed with H2O/SiO2 mole ratio = 42.<br>
For the first example with SDA A and SAR = 33, the synthesis was performed as follows: 3.0 g IN KOH aqueous solution, 0.39 g N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-propane-1,3-diamine (SDA A), and 8.4g deionized H2O were mixed together in a 23 mL Teflon cup. Next, 0.088g Reheis F-2000 was added and mixed thoroughly to yield a clear or translucent mixture. Finally, 0.90g Cabosil M-5 was added, and the resultant gel was thoroughly homogenized by mixing with a spatula by hand. The Teflon reactor was then capped' and sealed inside a'Parr autoclave. The autoclave was then placed in an oven with a rotating spit (43 rpm) and heated at 160°C for 17 days. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was removed, cooled to room temperature, and then the reactor contents were filtered under vacuum in a glass filtration funnel. The solids were then washed with 500-1500 mL deionized water and dried overnight either at room temperature or hi an oven at 90-150°C.<br>
In examples hi which seeds were added in aluminosilicate reactions, 0.02 g of the as-synthesized aluminosilicate MTT zeolite prepared with SDA A or E were used as the seed material.<br>
For borosilicate syntheses, a typical example is as follows (with SDA E): l.Og IN KOH, 0.70g N-isopropyl-l,3-propanediamine, and 10.4 g deionized H2O were mixed together in a 23 mL Teflon cup. Next 0.03 5g potassium tetraborate<br><br>
tetrahydrate was dissolved in the mixture. Finally 0.90 g of Cabosil M-5 was added, and the resultant gel was thoroughly mixed to create a uniform gel. The Teflon reactor was then capped and sealed inside a Parr autoclave. The autoclave was placed in an oven with a rotating spit (43 rpm) and heated at 150°C for 10 days. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was removed, cooled to room temperature, and then the reactor contents were filtered under vacuum in a glass filtration funnel. The solids were then washed with 500-1500 mL deionized water and either dried overnight at room temperature or in an oven at 90-150°C.<br>
In examples in which seeds were added in borosilicate reactions, 0.02 g of the as-synthesized MTT borosilicate zeolite prepared with SDA E was used as the seed material.<br>
