				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR ENHANCING THE MOBILIZATION OF MULTILINEAR<br>
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS TO THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD<br>
OSTEOGENIC GROWTH OLICIPEPTIDES AS STIMULIANTS OF HEMATOPOIESIS<br>
Field of th.e Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of oligopeptides corresponding to<br>
the C-terminal portion of OGP, as stimulators of hexnatopoiesis. More<br>
specifically, these oligopeptides enhance engraftment of bone marrow<br>
transplants, hematopoietic reconstruction, bone marrow re-population<br>
and number of circulating stem cells, particularly after chemotherapy or<br>
irradiation. The invention further provides methods for using these<br>
oligopeptides and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Biological and biochemical interactions between bone and bone marrow<br>
are far from being fully understood. However recent studies confirm the<br>
role of bone marrow derived osteogenic cells in supporting hematopoietic<br>
cell development [Teichman, R.S., et al., Hematol. 4:421-426 (2000)].<br>
Bone marrow transplantation studies confirm the bi-directional<br>
interactions between the two systems. Bone marrow ablation or<br>
iradiation damage triggers an initial local, transient osteogenic reaction<br>
[Amsel, S., et al, Anat. Rec. 164:101-111 (1969); Patt, H.M., and Maloney,<br>
M.A., Exp. Hematol. 3:135-148 (1975)]. In this osteogenic phase,<br>
trabeculae are formed in the marrow cavity. The trabeculae are transient<br>
and are resorbed during the reconstitution of haematopoietic marrow.<br>
Moreover, in human bone marrow donors, an increase in serum bone<br>
formation markers osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase was recorded<br>
after the removal of a substantial portion of iliac bone marrow [Foldes, J.,<br>
et al., J. Bone Miner. Res. 4:643-646 (1989)]. The hypothesis that human<br>
osteoblasts support human hematopoietic progenitor cells is very<br>
intriguing: these cells produce factors that directly stimulate the<br>
formation of hematopoietic colonies without the addition of exogenously<br>
supplied growth factors. In fact, osteoblasts secrete several cytokines<br>
including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),<br>
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor<br>
necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Besides, cultured<br>
osteoblasts support the maintenance of immature phenotype in<br>
hematopoietic stem cells [Taichman, et al., Blood 87:518-524 (1996)].<br>
Several of these growth factors improve in vivo bone marrow<br>
re-population and peripheral stem cell mobilization after high dose<br>
chemotherapy. Among them, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3 (Interleukine-3) and<br>
SCF (Stem Cell Factor) have been extensively evaluated [Bungart, B., et<br>
al., Br. J. Haematol. 76:174 (1990); Lant, T., et al., Blood 85:275 (1995);<br>
Brugger, W., et al., Blood 79:1193 (1992); Molinex, G., et al., Blood 78:961<br>
(1991)] and many others, such as FLT-3, are under study for clinical use<br>
[Ashihara, E., et al., Europ. J. Haematol. 60:86 (1998)]. Advances in this<br>
field in recent years, have allowed an understanding of several<br>
physiological aspects of bone marrow function. Moreover, the ability to<br>
modulate differentiation and proliferation of haematological precursors is<br>
at the basis of the more innovative therapies such as peripheral blood<br>
stem cell transplant, gene transfection and ex vivo expansion of stem<br>
cells. In spite of this impressive progress, several aspects of stem cell<br>
physiology have not been fully clarified, and several factors, both soluble<br>
or cell membrane related, are suspected of being involved in the<br>
physiological or pathological proliferation/differentiation of bone marrow<br>
cells. The increasing number of agents shown to be able to regulate<br>
hematopoiesis supports the critical question regarding the redundancy or<br>
subtlety of hematopoietic regulators [Metcaff, D., et al., Blood 82:3515<br>
(1993)].<br>
In addition to the role of classically defined growth factors, several<br>
biological agents and cell types could improve or modify both in vivo and<br>
ex vivo therapeutic strategies. Human bone marrow-derived endothelial<br>
cells support long term proliferation and differentiation of myeloid and<br>
megakaryocytic progenitors [Rafü, S., et al., Blood 86:3353 (1995)];<br>
accessory cells may support hematological recovery after bone marrow<br>
transplant [Bonnet, D., et al., Bone Marrow Transpl. 23:203 (1991)]; and,<br>
even more interesting for present purposes, osteoblasts may enhance the<br>
engraftment after HLA-unrelated bone marrow transplant in mice<br>
[El-Badri, N.S., et al, Exp. Hematol. 26:110 (1998)].<br>
Many chemical structures have been investigated in order to assess a<br>
possible role in bone marrow physiology. For example, effects of<br>
glycosaminoglycans have been evaluated both on leukemia-derived cells<br>
lines [Volpi, N., et al., Exp. Cell Ees. 215:119 (1994)] and in clonogenic<br>
tests on human cord blood-derived stem cells [Da Prato, I., et al., Leuk.<br>
Res. 23:1015 (1999)]. Even short peptides have been synthesized to reach<br>
hemoregulatory and multilineage effects, possibly by enhancement of<br>
cytokine production by stromal cells [King, A.G., et al., Exp. Hematol.<br>
20(4):531 (1992); Pelus, L.M., et al., Exp. Hematol. 22:239 (1994)].<br>
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) is the least common and carries the worst<br>
prognosis of the chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The primary<br>
pathogenic process is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder which<br>
results in anemia, atypical megakaryocyte hyperplasia, splenomegaly and<br>
varying degrees of extramedullary hematopoiesis. In contrast, the<br>
characteristic stromal proliferation is a reactive phenomenon, resulting<br>
from the inappropriate release of megakaryocyte/platelet-derived growth<br>
factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming<br>
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),<br>
epidermal growth factor (EGF), and calmodulin [Groopman, J., Ann.<br>
Intern. Med. 92:857-858 (1980); Chvapil, M., life Sci. 16:1345-1361 (1975)].<br>
The median survival of IMF patients is approximately 4 years. Therapeutic<br>
strategies in IMF remain predominantly supportive and directed towards<br>
the alleviation of symptoms and improvement in quality of life. The most<br>
common are blood transfusions, androgens and cytoreductive agents such<br>
as hydroxyurea. Bone marrow transplantation is increasingly being taien<br>
into consideration, but it still has to be regarded as an experimental<br>
approach. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has shown promising results in<br>
early hyperproliferative stages of IMF but has no or only very little effect in<br>
more advanced stages of the disease.<br>
It has been previously shown, by some of the inventors that osteogenic<br>
growth peptide (OGP), a 14-amino acid, highly conserved H4<br>
histone-related peptide, increases blood and bone marrow cellularity and<br>
enhances engraftment of bone marrow transplants in mice (Bab, I.A.,<br>
CEn. Orthop. 313:64 (1995); Gurevitch, O., et al., Blood 88:4719 (1996)<br>
and US Patent No. 5,461,034]. OGP has been isolated from the osteogenic<br>
phase of post-ablation bone marrow regeneration [Bab, I., et al.,<br>
Endocrinology, 128(5);2638 (1991)] and is physiologically present in high<br>
abundance in the blood, mainly as a complex with a2-macroglobulin<br>
(a2-M) [Gavish, H., et al., Biochemistry, 36:14883-14888 (1997)].<br>
Administered in vivo, it enhances bone formation and increases<br>
trabecular bone mass; in vitro, it stimulates the proliferation and alkaline<br>
phosphatase activity in osteogenic cell lines; in. addition, it is mitogenie to<br>
fibroblasts [Greenberg, Z., et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1178:273<br>
(1993)]. In addition to the activity of OGP on bone regeneration,<br>
osteoblast activation and fibroblast proliferation, it has been shown to<br>
induce, in vivo, a balanced increase in white blood cell (WBC) counts, and<br>
overall bone marrow cellularity in mice receiving myeloablative<br>
irradiation and syngeneic or semiallogeneic bone marrow transplants<br>
[Gurevitch, O., et al., ibid. (1996)].<br>
The C-terminal pentapeptide of OGP, designated OGP(10-14), which seems<br>
to be generated by proteolytic cleavage of the full length OG? upon<br>
dissociation of the inactive complex with a2-M, is present in mammalian,<br>
serum and osteogenic cell cultures at high levels [Bab, I., et al., J. Pept.<br>
Res. 54:408 (1999)]. N-terminal modified OGP retains the OGP-hke<br>
dose-dependent effect on cell proliferation, and it has been suggested that<br>
the carboxy-terminal pentapeptide is responsible for the binding to the<br>
putative OGP receptor [Greenberg, Z., et al., ibid. (1993)]. Additionally, the<br>
inventors have shown previously that in osteogenic MC3T3 El cells,<br>
mitogenic doses of OGP(10-14), but not OGP, enhance MAP kinase activity<br>
in a time- and dose dependent manner. These findings indicate that the<br>
OGP(10-14) is responsible for downstream signaling [Gabarin, et al., J. Cell<br>
Biol. 81:594-603 (2001)]. It has further been shown that the active form of<br>
OGP is its carboxy terminal pentapeptide OGP(10-14). Interestingly, the<br>
OGP(10-14) does not form a complex with <x2-m or other ogpbp></x2-m>
binding protein) [Bab, I., J. Peptide Res. 54:408-414 (1999)].<br>
Therefore, the possible hematopoietic activity of synthetic oligopeptides<br>
analogous to the C-terminal region of native OGP was evaluated in the<br>
present invention. Some such osteogenically active specific peptides are<br>
described in US Patent No. 5,814,610. sOGP(10-14) has been described as<br>
having opiate and analgesic activities [Kharchenko et al., Vepr. Med.<br>
Khim., 35(2) 106-109, (1989)].<br>
Importantly, the present invention shows that previously known<br>
osteogenically active oligopeptides can act as stimulants of the<br>
hemopoietic system. For example, the synthetic OGP-derived<br>
pentapeptide designated OGP(10-14) has several properties such as<br>
increasing blood and bone marrow cellularity in mice, and enhancing<br>
engraftment of bone marrow transDlants. This rentapentide exhibited<br>
significant activity on peripheral blood cell recoverv after<br>
cyclophosphamide (CFA)- induced aplasia, and on stem cell mobilization.<br>
Furthermore, the ex vivo effect of synthetic OGP(10-14) in bone marrow<br>
tissue samples from IMF. patients was tested and demonstrated a<br>
substantial overall increase in the number of hematopoietic cells.<br>
Moreover, the magnitude of the OGP(10-14) effect was directly related to<br>
the severity of IMF. These results indicate that OGP(10-14) may<br>
stimulate blood cell formation and rescue hematopoiesis.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to use OGP-drived<br>
oligopeptides as hematopoietic growth factors. This and other objects of<br>
the invention will be elaborated on as the description proceeds.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A number of methods of the arts of cell biology and peptide chemistry are<br>
not detailed herein, being well known to the person of skill in the art.<br>
Such methods include peptide synthesis and structural analysis,<br>
differential cell counts, cell sorting analyses, colony forming assays, and<br>
the like. Textbooks describing suck methods are e.g., Current Protocols in<br>
Immunology, Coligan et al. (eds), John Wiley &amp; Sons. Inc., New York, NY<br>
and Stewart, J.M. and Young J.D., In: Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis,<br>
Pierce Chemical Co., Rockfoxd, IL, pp. 1-175 (1984). These publications<br>
are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Furthermore, a<br>
number of immunological techniques are not in each instance described<br>
herein in detail, as they are well known to the person of skill in the art.<br>
The following abbreviations are used herein:<br>
OGP(s) - osteogenic growth polypeptide(s).<br>
OGPBP(s) - osteogenic growth polypeptide binding protein(s).<br>
sOGP - Synthetic OGP.<br>
WBC - (white blood cells).<br>
PBL - (peripheral blood).<br>
CFA- (cyclophosphamide).<br>
BMT - (bone marrow transplantation).<br>
IMF — (idiopatic myelofibrosis).<br>
Several cellular or soluble agents could be responsible for the interaction<br>
between bone and bone marrow cells. This interaction seems to be<br>
essential for the regulation of commitment, proliferation, and<br>
differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.<br>
OGP increases osteogenesis and bone marrow cellularity [Greenberg, Z., et<br>
al., ibid. (1993); Gurevitch, O., et al., ibid. (1996)]. Moreover, OGP is a<br>
potent mitogen for osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells and bone marrow<br>
stromal cells [Greenberg, Z., et al., J. Cellular Biochem, 65:359-367 (1997);<br>
Robinson, D., et al, J. Bone Min. Res., 10:690-696 (1995)].<br>
In an osteoblastic cell line, it has recently been reported that OGP<br>
activates mitogen-activated protein kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive<br>
G-protein. These activities appear to be restricted to C-terminal<br>
pentapeptide OGP(10-14) and, therefore, it has been suggested that<br>
OGP(10-14) is the bioactive form of OGP [Bab, I., et al., ibid. (1999)].<br>
OGP(10-14) could be extremely interesting in view of a possible in vivo<br>
utilization, considering the absence of immunogenicity and toxicity and<br>
the relative simplicity of the production and handling of the peptide.<br>
Previous studies have demonstrated that after daily s.c. injections of 0.1<br>
to 10 nmol OGP for 2 weeks in normal mice, the peptide induced an<br>
increase greater than 50% in the WBC counts and approximately 40%<br>
enhancement of overall bone marrow cellularity [Gurevitch, O., et al.,<br>
ibid., (1996)]. The proportion of different cell types was not altered by the<br>
treatment, which suggests a multilineage activity on hematopoiesis.<br>
Interestingly, in the experiment described herein, after reversible aplasia<br>
induced by the administration of CFA (cyclophosphamide), mice treated<br>
by OGP (10-14) recovered faster than those injected with placebo and<br>
without any valuable toxicity at the employed doses.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising as an effective ingredient at least one<br>
oligopeptide having stimulatory activity on the production of<br>
hematopoietic cells, preferably having the amino acid sequences<br>
Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly, Tyr-Gly-Phe-His-Gly, Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly or<br>
Met-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly, also denoted by SEQ ID NOs:1, 2, 3, and 4,<br>
respectively, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The process of blood cell formation whereby red and white blood cells axe<br>
replaced through the division of cells located in the bone marrow is called<br>
hematopoiesis. For review of hematopoiesis see Dexter and Spooncer<br>
[Ann. Rev. Cell Biol, 3:423-441 (1987)].<br>
There are many different types of blood cells, which belong to distinct cell<br>
lineages. Along each, lineage, there are cells at different stages of<br>
maturation. Mature blood cells are specialized for different functions. For<br>
example, erythrocytes are involved- in O2 and CO2 transport; T and B<br>
lymphocytes are involved in cell and antibody mediated immune<br>
responses, respectively; platelets are required for blood clotting; and the<br>
granuloctyes and macrophages act as general scavengers and accessory<br>
cells. Granulocytes can be further divided into basophils, eosinophils,<br>
neutrophils and mast cells.<br>
In a specifically preferred embodiment of the present aspect, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises an oligopeptide<br>
which is a pentapeptide having the formula: Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly as<br>
denoted by SEQ ID NO:1. This pentapeptide is designated OGP(10-14)<br>
throughout the present application.<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention<br>
comprises an oligopeptide which is a pentapeptide having the formula:<br>
Tyr-Gly-Phe-His-Gly, as denoted by SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
invention comprises an oligopeptide which is a tetrapeptide having the<br>
formula: Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly, as denoted by SEQ ED NO:3.<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention<br>
comprises an oligopeptide which is a hexapeptide having the formula<br>
Met-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly, as denoted by SEQ ID NO:4, in which the<br>
methionine residue may be acylated.<br>
The peptides used as the effective ingredient in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention are synthetically produced by known<br>
organic chemistry methods. Such, synthesis is described, for example, in<br>
said US Patent No. 5,814,610.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present aspect, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention is intended for enhancement<br>
of engraffcment of bone marrow transplants, hematopoietic<br>
reconstruction, bone marrow re-population and the number of circulating<br>
hematopoietic stem cells.<br>
According to another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
invention is intended for enhancement of engraftment of bone marrow<br>
transplants, hematopoietic reconstruction, bone marrow re-population<br>
and the number of circulating hematopoietic stem cells of a patient<br>
receiving chemotherapy or irradiation.<br>
The capacity of the hematopoietic stem cells to provide for the lifelong<br>
production of all blood lineages is accomplished by a balance between the<br>
stem cell plasticity, that is the production of committed progenitors cells<br>
which generate specific blood lineages, and the stem cell replication in<br>
the undifferentiated state (self-renewal). The mechanism regulating<br>
hematopoietic stem cell plasticity and self-renewal in vivo have been<br>
difficult to define. However, the major contributory factors represent a<br>
combination of cell intrinsic and environmental influences (Morrison, et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:10302-10306 (1995)]. The importance of<br>
the hematopoietic microenvironment has been established through the<br>
use of long-term bone marrow culture systems where hematopoietic cells<br>
cultured on stroma allow for the maintenance of HSCs, albeit at low<br>
frequencies [Fraser, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992);<br>
Wineman, et al., Blood 81:365-372 (1993)].<br>
The demonstration of hematopoietic cell maintenance in culture has led<br>
to efforts to identify candidate "stem cell" factors. The role of<br>
hematopoietic cytokines in stem cell maintenance has been studied by<br>
direct addition of purified factors to in vitro cultures of stem cell<br>
populations followed by transplantation of the cultured cells [Meunch, et<br>
al, Blood 81:3463-3473 (1993); Wineman et al., ibid. (1993); Rebel, et al.,<br>
Blood 83:128-136 (1994)]. Most of the known "early-acting" cytokines such<br>
aa IL-3, IL-6 and KL have been shown to stimulate proliferation of more<br>
committed progenitor cells while concurrently allowing maintenance but<br>
not expansion, of cells capable of long-term multilineage repopulation<br>
[reviewed in Williams, Blood 81(12):3169-3172 (1993); Muller-Sieburg<br>
and Deryugina, Stem Cells, 13:477-486 (1995)]. While these data indicate<br>
that the cells plasticity and repopulating function may be preserved by<br>
cytokine treatment, the molecules that promote self-renewal of these<br>
pluripotent cells remain unknown.<br>
The polypeptide used in the pharmaceutical composition of the invention<br>
has been shown to increase the percentage of circulating multilineage<br>
progenitor cells. These multilineage progenitor cells are the circulating<br>
early precursor CD34 positive cells.<br>
In the human and mouse, primitive mature hematopoietic progenitor<br>
cells can be identified a belonging to a class of cells defined by their<br>
expression of a cell surface antigen designated CD34. These cells may be<br>
referred to as CD34 positive cells. In the mouse, an early subclass of the<br>
CD 34 positive hematopiotic cells are the double positive CD 34+ /Sea± cells.<br>
The analogous Sca-1 cell surface antigen in the human is Flk2. Therefore,<br>
human CD34/Flk2 double positive cells are considered equivalent to the<br>
mouse double positive CD34/Sca-1 cells.<br>
Human hematopoietic progenitor cells which express the CD34 antigen<br>
and/or the Flk 2 receptor are referred to herein as "primitive progenitor<br>
cells." By contrast, hematopiotic cells which do not express either the<br>
CD34 antigen or the flk2 receptor are referred to as "mature progenitor<br>
cells." Therefore, as preferred embodiment the multilineage progenitor<br>
cells are the circulating early precursor CD34/Flk2 double positive cells.<br>
As used herein, "progenitor cell" refers to any somatic cell, which has the<br>
capacity to generate fully differentiated, functional progeny by<br>
differentiation and proliferation. Progenitor cells include progenitors<br>
from any tissue or organ system, including, but not limited to, blood,<br>
nerve, muscle, skin, gut, bone, kidney, liver, pancreas, thymus, and the<br>
like. Progenitor cells are distinguished from "differentiated cells",,which<br>
are defined as those cells which may or may not have the capacity to<br>
proliferate, i.e., self-replicate, but which are unable to undergo further<br>
differentiation to a different cell type under normal physiological<br>
conditions. Moreover, progenitor cells are further distinguished from<br>
abnormal cells such as cancer cells, especially leukemia cells, which<br>
proliferate (self-replicate) but which generally do not further<br>
differentiate, despite appearing to be immature or undifferentiated.<br>
Progenitors are defined by their progeny, e.g., granulocyte/macrophage<br>
colony-forming progenitor cells (GM-CFU) differentiate into neutrophils<br>
or macrophages; primitive erythroid blast-forming units (BFU-E)<br>
differentiate into erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) which give rise<br>
to mature erythrocytes. Similarly, the Meg-CFU, GEMM-CFU, Eos-CFU<br>
and Bas-CFU progenitors are able to differentiate into megakaryocytes,<br>
granulocytes, macrophage, eosinophils and basophils, respectively.<br>
Various other hematopoitic progenitors have been characterized. For<br>
example, hematopoietic progenitor cells include those cells, which are<br>
capable of successive cycles of differentiating and proliferating to yield up<br>
to eight different mature hematopoietic cells lineages. At the most<br>
primitive or undifferentiated end of the hematopiotic spectrum,<br>
hematopoietic progenitor cells include the hematopietic "stem cells."<br>
These rare cells, which represent 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 of cells in the<br>
bone marrow, each have the capacity to generate &gt;1013 mature blood cells<br>
of all lineages and are responsible for sustaining blood cell production<br>
over the life of an organism. They reside in the bone marrow primarily in<br>
a quiescent state and may form identical daughter cells through a process<br>
called self-renewal. Accordingly, such an uncommitted progenitor can be<br>
described as being "omnipotent," i.e., both necessary and sufficient for<br>
generating all types of mature blood cells. Progenitor cells which retain a<br>
capacity to generate all blood cell lineages, but which cannot self-renew<br>
are termed "pluripotent". Cells which can produce some but not all blood<br>
lineages and cannot self-renew are termed "multipotent."<br>
The oligopeptides used in the invention are useful in preserving any of<br>
these progenitors cells, including unipotent progenitor cells, pluripotent<br>
progenitor cells, and/or omnipotent progenitor cells. The oligopeptides,<br>
and particularly OGP(10-14), demonstrate particular efficacy<br>
preserving hematopoietic progenitor cells.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the oligopeptide used as an effective<br>
ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition of the invention enhances<br>
the immature cell monocyte recovery and selectively increases any one of<br>
the BFU-E and GEMM colony forming units (CFU).<br>
Example 3 below describes ex vivo assessment of hematopoietic colony<br>
formation derived from OGP(10-14) and control treated mice. The results<br>
indicate an increase of GEMM-CFU and BFU-E in cultures derived from<br>
OGP(10-14)-treated mice compared to the vehicle only control group,<br>
whereas a positive G-CSF control induces a significant increase of<br>
GM-CFU. The increases in colony formation in cultures derived from<br>
OGP(10-14) treated mice where apparent only when the treatment began<br>
seven days prior to chemoablation. Both in vivo and ex vivo results<br>
reached by OGP(10-14) confirm the previously reported multilineage<br>
activity of full-length OGP compared to different cytokines. Differently to<br>
other growth and mobilizing factors [Fleming, W., et al., Proe. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 90:3760 (1993)], sOGP(10-14) increases the number of<br>
hematopoeitic stems cells in the peripheral blood without reducing the<br>
bone marrow stem cells compartment.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may therefore be<br>
intended for increasing the number of white blood cells (WBC),<br>
circulating hematopoietic stem cells, and overall bone marrow cellularity.<br>
In a specifically preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention<br>
is intended for supporting bone marrow transplantation. This effect is<br>
due to the activity of the oligopeptides that increases the number of stem<br>
cells, accelerates the hematopoietic reconstruction upon bone marrow<br>
transplantation and increases the cellularity of bone marrow.<br>
As described in Example 1, the oligopeptides of the invention have been<br>
found to enhance the engraftment of bone marrow transplants and to<br>
stimulate hematopoietic reconstruction. Bone marrow transplantation<br>
(BMT) is progressively and rapidly becoming the treatment of choice in<br>
instances of hematological malignancies such as lymphomas, Hodgkin"s<br>
diseases and acute leukemia as well as solid cancers, in particular<br>
melanoma and breast cancer. Recently, BMT is increasingly being taken<br>
into consideration in treatment of myeloproliferative disorders such as<br>
IMF (idiopathic myelofibrosis). Potentially, with improved methods, BMT<br>
can also be used for treating other catastrophic diseases - AIDS, aplastic<br>
anemia and autiommune disorders. The aim of all BMT is to replace the<br>
host hematopoietic stem cells, omnipotent and pluripotent, injured by<br>
chemotherapy, radiation or disease. These stem cells can replicate<br>
repeatedly and differentiate to give rise to the whole variety of cells<br>
present in blood namely erythrocytes, platelets and WBC which include<br>
lymphocytes, monoccytes and neutrophils. Resident macrophages and<br>
osteoclasts are also derived from hemopoietic omnipotent stem cells. As<br>
the stem cells differentiate, they commit themselves more and more to a<br>
particular lineage until they can form only one kind of the above cells.<br>
Therefore, according to another specifically preferred embodiment, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be used in treating<br>
bone marrow transplanted subjects suffering from a hematological<br>
disorder, solid tumor, immunological disorder or aplastic anemia. More<br>
specifically, the hematological disorder may be a lymphoma, Hodgkin"s<br>
disease or acute leukemia and myeloproliferative disorder, particularly<br>
idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF).<br>
In IMF bone erythropoiesis evolves to a progressive failure, whereas<br>
ectopic hemopoiesis develops and increases. Pathological calcification of<br>
fibrosis and structural alterations of trabecular bone may be responsible<br>
for an absolute or relative deficit of osteoblasts secreted factors and thus,<br>
at least partially responsible for the impaired bone marrow function.<br>
The results described in Example 4, strongly suggest that the OGP(10-14)<br>
can increase the hematopoietic cell density of bone marrow in cultured<br>
bone fragments from IMF patients without modifying, in such a short<br>
time, the fibrosis. The cell increment appears to be balanced and it does<br>
not account for the expansion of atypical cells. One may not exclude, of<br>
course, that OGP(10-14) simply preserves in culture the bone marrow<br>
structure and cellularity of IMF samples compared to those found in<br>
samples cultured without the pentapeptide. However, the preserved or<br>
even increased cellularity in some OGP(10-14) cultured samples<br>
compared to that found in the native ones, suggests a proliferative<br>
activity of the peptide. It is not clear, at present, if OGP acts on blood<br>
precursors directly or via stromal cells or different cell populations but, at<br>
least at the morphological level, its activity appears independent of a<br>
significant remodelling of microenvironment.<br>
One implication of this observation is that OGP(10-14) is, in fact, able to<br>
enhance, in vitro, three lineage expansion of human hematopoietic cells.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise as active<br>
ingredient an oligopeptide as described above, or a mixture of such<br>
oligopeptides, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or<br>
stabilizer, and optionally other therapeutic constituents. Acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients or stabilizers are non-toxic to recipients at the<br>
dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers, such as<br>
phosphate buffered saline and like physiologically acceptable buffers, and<br>
more generally all suitable carriers, excipients and stabilizers known in<br>
the art, e.g., for the purposes of adding flavors, colors, lubrication, or the<br>
hie to the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Carriers may include starch and derivatives thereof, cellulose and<br>
derivatives thereof, e.g., microcrystalline cellulose, Xantham gum, and<br>
the like. Lubricants may include hydrogenated castor oil and the like.<br>
A preferred buffering agent is phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS),<br>
which solution is also adjusted for osmolarity.<br>
A preferred pharmaceutical formulation is one lacking a carrier. Such<br>
formulations are preferably used for administration by injection,<br>
including intravenous injection.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions is well known in the art<br>
and has been described in many articles and textbooks, see e.g.,<br>
Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro A. R. ed., Mack<br>
Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 1990, and especially pages<br>
1521-1712 therein.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared in<br>
dosage units forms. The dosage forms may also include sustained release<br>
devices. The compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well<br>
known in the art of pharmacy. Such dosage forms encompass<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers that are inherently non-toxic and<br>
non-therapeutic. Examples of such carriers include ion exchangers,<br>
alumina, aluminum stearate, lectithin, serum proteins, such as human<br>
serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic<br>
acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable<br>
fatty acids, water, salts, or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate,<br>
disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium<br>
chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, cellulose- based substances, and PEG. Carriers for topical or<br>
gel-based forms of these polypeptides include polysaccharides such as<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose or methylcelluslose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polyacrylasts, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, PEG, and wood was<br>
alcohols. For all adminstratioins, conventional depot forms are suitably<br>
used. Such forms include for example, microcapsules, nano-capsules,<br>
liposomes, plasters, inhalation forms, nose sprays, sublingual tablets, and<br>
sustained-release preparations.<br>
Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include<br>
semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the<br>
oligopeptides according to the invention, which matrices are in the form<br>
of shaped articles, e.g. films, or micro-capsules. Examples of<br>
sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides as<br>
described by, (U.S. Pat. No. 3,377,919), copolymers of L-glumatic acid and<br>
?-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable<br>
lactic aeid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the Lupron Depots™<br>
(injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycoiic acid copolymer<br>
and leupronde acitate), and poly-D-(-)3-tydroxybutyic add. While polymers<br>
such as ethylenevmyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release<br>
of molecules for over 100 days, certain, hydrogels release proteins for<br>
shorter time periods. When encapsulated, the peptides remain in the<br>
body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of<br>
exposure to moisture of 37°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and<br>
possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised<br>
for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if<br>
the aggrergation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond<br>
formation through- thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be<br>
achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from -acidic<br>
solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and<br>
developing specific polymer matrix compositions.<br>
Sustained-release oligopeptides and particularly the sOGP1-14<br>
compositions also include lipsomally entrapped polypeptides. Lipsom.es<br>
containing these polypeptides are prepared by methods known in the art,<br>
such as described in Eppstein, et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA<br>
82:3688-3692 (1985); Hwang, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030<br>
(1980); US Patents Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Ordinarily, the<br>
lipsomes are the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in<br>
which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol.% cholesterol, the<br>
selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal polypeptides therapy.<br>
Lipsomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in US Patent No.<br>
5,013,556.<br>
Therapeutic formulations of the oligopeptides are prepared for storage by<br>
mixing these polypeptide having the desired degree of purity with<br>
optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers<br>
[Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16h edition, Osol, A., Ed., (1980)],<br>
in the form of lyophilized cake or aqtieous solutions. Acceptable carriers,<br>
excipients, or stabilizers are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate,<br>
and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low<br>
molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins,<br>
such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic<br>
polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine,,<br>
glutamine, asparagine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides, and other carbhydrates including glucose, mannose, or<br>
dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol<br>
and sorbitol; slat-forming counter-ions such a sodium; and/or non-ionic<br>
surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics™ or polyethlene glycol (PEG).<br>
The oligopeptides may also be entrapped in micro-capsules prepared, for<br>
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for<br>
example, hydroxymetfaylcellulose or gelatine-microcapsules and<br>
poly(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively), in colloidal drug<br>
delivery system (for example, liposomes, albumin microsbperes,<br>
microemulsions, nanoparticles, and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions.<br>
Such techniques are disclosed in Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences,<br>
ibid.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is preferably for a once daily use by a<br>
subject in need, and preferably comprises a dosage of active ingredient of<br>
about 0.001 to about 50 nmol, more preferably about 0.05 to 25 nmol,<br>
most preferably about 0.1 to about 10 nmol.<br>
It is to be appreciated that in addition to the described oligopeptides, the<br>
transplantation-supporting composition of the present invention may<br>
further optionally comprise other therapeutic constituents. Such<br>
constituents may be one or more known cytokines, for example, IL-3,<br>
IL-4, IL-5, G-CSF, GM-CSF (gramdocytemacrophage colony stimulating<br>
factor) and M-CSP (macrophage colony stimulating factor). When such<br>
further component is incorporated in the composition, the effect of the<br>
composition in supporting bone-marrow transplantation can increase<br>
synergistically.<br>
As a second aspect, the present invention relates to the use of any of the<br>
above described oligopeptides, particularly Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly,<br>
Tyr-Gly-Phe-His-Gly, Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly and Met-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly, as<br>
denoted by SEQ ID NOs:l, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, in the preparation of<br>
a pharmaceutical composition for enhancement of engraftment of bone<br>
marrow transplant, hematopoietic reconstruction, bone marrow<br>
re-population and number of circulating stem cells.<br>
In addition, the oligopeptides described herein may be used" in the<br>
preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for accelerating the<br>
engraftment of bone marrow transplants, enhancing proliferation of<br>
transplanted stem cells and thus increasing the availability of all types of<br>
hematopoietic cells including erythrocytes and thus obviating the need<br>
for supporting the host with these cells for at least several weeks;<br>
enhancing stromal hematopoietic microenvironment by increasing the<br>
stromal cells number and/or expression of stromal cell derived factors<br>
that support hemopoiesis; enhancing the hematopoietic stem cell<br>
expression of receptors to factors that support hemopoiesis; enhancing<br>
the "homing" of intravenously administered bone marrow transplants to<br>
the host bone marrow; enhancing the restoration of blood cellularity after<br>
BMT; enabling successful transplantation using reduced cell number,<br>
thus decreasing the number of (multiple) marrow extractions from donors<br>
and enabling the use of transplants as small as 10-15 ml (instead of 1000<br>
ml); increasing the number of hematopoietic omnipotent and/or<br>
pluripotent stem cells in the donor peripheral blood, thus improving the<br>
feasibility of transplanting stem cells from peripheral blood; increasing<br>
the number of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro in long-term bone marrow<br>
cultures for use as transplants and also providing for a method of<br>
inhibiting growth of tumor cells in allografts from leukemia patients;<br>
enhancing the endogenous restoration of marrow and blood cellularity<br>
after chemo and/or radiotherapy; and enhancing the restoration of<br>
population of resident macrophages after BMT or after chemo- and/ox<br>
radiotherapy.<br>
The magnitude of a therapeutic dose of an oligopeptides or the<br>
composition of the invention will of course vary with the group of patients<br>
(age, sex, etc.), the nature of the condition to be treated and with the<br>
particular oligopeptide employed and its route of administration. In any<br>
case the therapeutic dose will be determined by the attending physician.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a<br>
mammal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a polypeptide of<br>
this invention. Intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administration may<br>
be preferred.<br>
As a preferred embodiment, these oligopeptides are used for the<br>
preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for increasing the<br>
circulating multilineage progenitor cells percentage. These multilineage<br>
progenitor cells are the circulating early precursor CD34 positive cells,<br>
and preferably, CD34/Flk2 double positive cells.<br>
A "hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell" or "primitive hematopoietic cell"<br>
as described above, is a cell which is able to differentiate to form a more<br>
committed or mature blood cell type. A "hematopoietic stem cell" or "stem<br>
cell" is one that is specifically capable of long-term engraftment of a<br>
lethally irradiated host.<br>
A "CD34+ cell population" is enriched for hemotopoietic stem cells. A<br>
CD34+ cell population can be obtained from umbilical blood or bone<br>
marrow, for example. Human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells can be<br>
selected for using immuncmagnetic beads sold by Miltenyi (Calfornia),<br>
following the Manufacturer"s directions.<br>
Furthermore, the oligopeptides used fox the preparation of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention enhance the immature cell<br>
and monocyte recovery and selectively increases any one of the BFU-E<br>
and GEMM colony forming units (CFU).<br>
Accordingly, such oligopeptides are used in the preparation of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition for increasing the number of white blood<br>
cells (WBC), circulating hematopoietic stem, and overall bone marrow<br>
cellularity.<br>
More specifically, the invention provides the use of these polypeptides in<br>
the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for supporting bone<br>
marrow transplantation. This effect is due to the activity of the<br>
oligopeptides in increasing the number of stem cells, accelerating the<br>
hematological reconstruction upon bone marrow transplantation and<br>
increasing the cellularity of bone marrow.<br>
According to another specifically preferred embodiment, the present<br>
invention relates to the use of said oligopeptides in the preparation of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition for treating a subject suffering from<br>
hematological disorders, solid tumors, immunological disorders and<br>
aplastic anemia. More specifically, the hematological disorder may be a<br>
lymphoma, leukemias, Hodgkin"s disease and myeloproliferative<br>
disorders, particularly idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF).<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for<br>
enhancement of engraftment of bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic<br>
reconstruction, bone marrow re-population and number of circulating<br>
stem cells. This method comprises aclministering to a subject in need<br>
thereof, an effective amount of an oligopeptide having stimulatory<br>
activity on hematopoietic cells as described above, or of a composition of<br>
the invention.<br>
According to another embodiment, the invention provids a method for<br>
enhancement of engraftment of bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic<br>
reconstruction, bone marrow re-population and number of circulating<br>
stem cells in patients receiving chemotherapy or irradiation.<br>
In yet another embodiment, an effective amount of the oligopeptides or<br>
the composition of the invention may be used to improve engraftment in<br>
bone marrow transplantation or to stimulate mobilization and/or<br>
expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in a mammal prior to harvesting<br>
hematopoietic progenitors from the peripheral blood thereof<br>
According to a specific embodiment of this aspect, the invention relates to<br>
a method of treating a subject suffering from a hematological disorder,<br>
solid tumor, immunological disorder or aplastic anemia, by administering<br>
to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an oligopeptide<br>
having stimulatory activity on production of hematopoietic cells, or of a<br>
composition comprising the same according to the invention.<br>
In another specific embodiment, this method can be used in support of<br>
the treatment of the subject by bone marrow transplantation.<br>
For therapeutic applications, the oligopeptides or the pharmaceutical<br>
composition useful according to the invention are administered to a<br>
mammal, preferable a human, in a physiologically acceptable dosage<br>
from, including those that may be administered to a human<br>
intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time.<br>
Alternative routes of administration include intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, intra-cerebrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular,<br>
intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral or topical routes. The oligopeptides or the<br>
compositions of the invention also are suitably administered by<br><br>
intratumoral, peritumoral, intralesional, or perilesional routes or to the<br>
lymph, to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects.<br>
The oligopeptides or the pharmaceutical compositions to be used for in<br>
vivo administration must be sterile, This is readily accomplished by<br>
filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following<br>
lypophiliization and reconstitution. Oligopeptides may he stored in<br>
solution. Therapeutic oligopeptides compositions generally are placed into<br>
a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous<br>
solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection<br>
needle.<br>
An "effective amount" of any of the oligopeptides or compositions of the<br>
invention to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon<br>
the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition<br>
of the patient. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the therapist to titer<br>
the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain<br>
the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer the<br>
oligopeptide until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. A<br>
typical daily dosage for systemic treatment might range from about 0.001<br>
nmol/Kg to up to 50 nmol/Kg or more, depending on the factors<br>
mentioned above.<br>
Another specific embodiment relates to the treatment of a subject<br>
carrying a transplant, where an ex vivo method may be adopted. In this<br>
method, the cells intended for transplantation are exposed to effective<br>
amount of the oligopeptides or compiositions of the invention, prior to<br>
their transplantation.<br>
The most common way currently available for acquiring a sufficient<br>
amount of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation is to extract 1<br>
liter or more of marrow tissue from multiple site in the donor"s bones<br>
with needle and syringe, an involved process that usually requires<br>
general anaesthesia. The donors of allogeneic BMT are usually siblings<br>
whose tissue types are compatible and sometimes unrelated donors who<br>
are matched to the recipient by HLA typing. Autologous transplants, that<br>
eliminate the need for HLA matching may be used in patients undergoing<br>
ablative chemoradiotherapy for the eradication of solid tumors.<br>
Autologous stem cells may also be obtained from the umbilical cord blood<br>
at birth and stored for future administration.<br>
After transplantation and prior to the establishment of a donor-derived<br>
functioning marrow the patients hosting BMT present with a transient<br>
marked pancytopenia that exposes them to infections. The incidence of<br>
bacterial and fungal infections correlates with both the severity and<br>
duration of pancytopenia [Slavin, S. and Nagler, A., Transplantation<br>
(1992)]. For a similar reason, the CSF fail to support erythxopoiesis and<br>
platelet formation.<br>
Oligopeptides that support hematopoiesis may prove useful in other ways<br>
as well. Some investigators have found that adding stem, cells from the<br>
peripheral blood to those from the bone marrow significantly increases<br>
the rate of engraftment extracting sufficient numbers of stem cells from<br>
peripheral blood is a complicated procedure. Administering such<br>
oligopeptides to donors to increase the number of stem cells in the blood<br>
will improve the feasibility of transplanting stem cells from peripheral<br>
blood [Golde, D.W., Sci. Am. 36 December (1991)].<br>
The prerequisite for hematopoiesis and therefore successful MBT is the<br>
presence of functional stromal cells and tissue that compromise the<br>
hematopoietic microenvironment, determine the homing of the injected<br>
stem ceils from the circulation to the bone marrow and support<br>
hematopoiesis [Watson, J.D. and McKenna, H. J. Int. J. Cell Cloning<br>
10:144 (1992)]. Bone marrow derived stromal tissue also provide the<br>
conditions to sustain stem cells in in vitro long-term bone marrow<br>
cultures. At present this technology suffices to keep stem cells alive.<br>
Adding the appropriate hemopoietic oligopeptides to these cultures may<br>
help expand the stem cell population in uitro, this providing increased<br>
numbers of these cells for transplantation.<br>
A combined in vitro/in-vivo approach may provide the basis for a<br>
forward-looking strategy for (i) obtaining small stem cell preparations<br>
from donor blood or marrow and (ii) healthy individuals to have their<br>
stem cells stored for a time when the cells might be needed to treat a<br>
serious disease, thus bypassing the complexity associated with the use of<br>
allogeneic BMT.<br>
It would therefore be of therapeutic importance to use small peptides<br>
such as the oligopeptides described in the present application, that<br>
stimulate post- BMT hematopoietic reconstruction by enchancing in. vivo,<br>
ex vivo and/or in vitro the hematopoietic microenvironment of which<br>
fibrous tissue, bone and bone cells are important components. Such<br>
peptides may also support hematopoiesis in spontaneously occurring or<br>
induced myelosuppression condition that do not necessarily involved<br>
BMT.<br>
The oligopeptides described in the present application and preferably the<br>
pentapeptide OGP(10-14), appear to directly act at the level of the early<br>
hematopoietic precursor (i.e., hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells). Such<br>
an expanded stem cell population can serve as the source of cells for<br>
myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis (e.g., splenic erythropoiesis) and<br>
lymphopoiesis. Accordingly, these oligopeptides can be used to stimulate<br>
proliferation and/or maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells<br>
either in vitro or in vivo (e.g., for treating hematopoietic diseases or<br>
disorders).<br>
Therefore, a preferred embodiment relates to a method for enhancing the<br>
proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. According to the<br>
invention, this method comprises the steps of exposing these cells to an<br>
effective amount of an oligopeptide having stimulatory activity on<br>
hematopoietic cells, or to an effective amount of a composition comprising<br>
the same, as described above. According to the invention such exposure is<br>
effective in enhancing the proliferation of said cells.<br>
The term "enhancing proliferation of a cell" encompasses the step .of<br>
increasing the extent of growth an/or reproduction of the cell relative to<br>
an untreated cell either in vitro or in vivo. An increase in cell<br>
proliferation in cell culture can be detected by counting the number of<br>
cells before and after exposure to a molecule of interest. The extent of<br>
proliferation can he quantified via microscopic examination of the degree<br>
of confluency. Cell proliferation can also be quantified using a thymidine<br>
or BrdU incorporation assay.<br>
In a specifically preferred embodiment, the method of the invention is<br>
intended for enhancing the proliferation of a CD34 positive cells,<br>
preferably Flk2 positive cells.<br>
The oligopeptides or the compositions of the invention are useful in in<br>
vivo or ex vivo enhancing the number and/or proliferation and/or<br>
differentiation and/or maintenance of hematopietic stem/progenitor cells,<br>
expand population of these cells and enhance repopulation of such cells<br>
and blood cells of multiple lineages in a mammal.<br>
In one specifically preferred embodiment, these cells are in cell culture<br>
and therefore, this would be an ex-vivo/in vitro method.<br>
Alternatively, the method of the invention may be used as an in vivo<br>
method of treatment, in case that the treated cells are present in a<br>
mammal.<br>
"Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or<br>
preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already<br>
with the disease or disorder as well as those in which the disease or<br>
disorder is to be prevented.<br>
"Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a<br>
mammal including, human, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports,<br>
or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the<br>
mammal is human.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the mammal treated by the method of the<br>
invention is suffering from, or is susceptible to, decreased blood cell<br>
levels, which may be caused by chemotherapy, irradiation therapy, bone<br>
marrow transplantation therapy or any other iatrogenic or natural cause.<br>
Chemo- and radiation therapies cause dramatic reductions in blood cell<br>
population in cancer patients. At least 500,000 cancer patients undergo<br>
chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the US and Europe each year and<br>
another 200,000 in Japan. Bone marrow transplantation therapy of value<br>
in aplastic anemia, primary immunodeficiency, acute leukemia and solid<br>
tumors (following total body irradiation) is becoming more widely<br>
practiced by the medical community. At least 15,000 Americans have<br>
bone marrow transplants each year. Other diseases can cause a reduction<br>
in entire or selected blood cell lineages. Examples of these conditions<br>
include anemia (including macrocytic and aplactic anemia);<br>
thrombocytopenia; hypoplasia; immune (autoimmune) thrombocytopenic<br>
purpur (ITP); and HIV induced ITP.<br>
Pharmaceutical products axe needed which, are able to enhance<br>
reconstitution of blood cell populations of these patients.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method<br>
for enhancing the proliferation and/or differentiation and/or maintenance<br>
of primitive hematopoietic cells. Such a method may be useful for<br>
enhancing repopulation of hematopoietic stem cells and thus mature<br>
blood cell lineages. This is desirable where a mammal has suffered a<br>
decrease in hematopoietic or mature blood cells as a consequence of<br>
disease, radiation or chemotherapy. This method is also useful for<br>
generating expanded populations of such stem cells and mature blood cell<br>
lineages from such hematopoietic cells ex vivo.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method<br>
for 172. vitro/ex-vivo maintaining and/or expanding stem cells. This method<br>
comprising isolating peripheral blood cells from a blood sample, enriching<br>
blood progenitor cells expressing the CD34 antigen, cluttering the<br>
enriched blood progenitor cells under suitable conditions, and treating<br>
said cells with an oligopeptide having stimulatory activity on<br>
hematopoietic cells, or with a composition comprising as an effective<br>
ingredient an oligopeptide having stimulatory activity on hematopoietic<br>
cells, according to the invention.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the method of the invention might include a<br>
further step of exposing the treated cells to a cytokine. As a non-limiting<br>
example, such cytokine may be selected from the group consisting of TPO<br>
(Throrabopoietin), EPO (Erythropoietin), M-CSF (Macrophage-colony<br>
stimulating factor), GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage-CSF), G-CSF<br>
(Granulocyte CSF), IL-1 (Interleukin-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7,<br>
IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor) and KL (Kit<br>
ligand).<br>
As an embodiment to an in vivo treatment, the invention relates to a<br>
method for re-populating blood cells in a mammal. This method<br>
comprises the steps of administering to said mammal a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of an oligopeptide having stimulatory activity on<br>
hematopoietic cells, or of an effective amount of the composition of the<br>
invention. These hematopoietic cells may be any one of erythroid, myeloid<br>
and lymphoid cells.<br>
"Lymphoid blood cell lineages" are those hematopoietic precursor cells<br>
which can differentiate to form lymphocytes (B-cells or T-cells). Likewise,<br>
"lymphopoiesis" is the formation of lymphocytes.<br>
"Erythroid blood cell lineages" are those hematopoietic precursor cells<br>
which candifferentiate to form erythrocytes (red blood cells) and<br>
"erythropoiesis" is the formation of erythrocytes.<br>
The phrase "myeloid blood cell lineages", for the purposes herein,<br>
encompasses all hematopoietic precursor cells, other than lymphoid and<br>
erythroid blood cell lineages as defined above, and "myelopoiesis" involves<br>
the formation of blood cells (other than lymphocytes and erythrocytes).<br>

Example 1<br>
Effect of OGP(10-14) on engraftment of bone marrow transplant<br>
Materials and methods<br>
CV57 Black female mice were used to investigate the possible effect of<br>
OGP(10-14) on engraftment of bone marrow transplats. OGP(10-14) in<br>
phosphate buffered saline was administered by daily subcutaneous, 10 ml<br>
injections for 12 days. The daily dose ranged from 0.001 to 10 nmol per<br>
mouse. Control mice received phosphate buffered saline only. On day 8<br>
after the onset of OGP(10-14) treatment the mice were subjected to total<br>
body X-ray irradiation consisting of a single 900 rad dose using a 60Co<br>
source (Picker C-9, 102.5 rad/min). This was followed immediately by an<br>
intravenous injection of 105 unselected syngeneic bone marow cells. The<br>
animals were sacrificed 14 days after the onset of OGP(10-14) treatment,<br>
both femurs were dissected out and their ephiphyseal ends removed. The<br>
bone marrow was washed out completely into phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS). A single cell suspension was prepared by drawing the preparation<br>
several times through graded syringe needles and the cells were counted<br>
in a hemocytometer.<br>
Results<br>
Fig. 1 shows a stimulatory effect of the OGP(10-14) on the number of<br>
post-irradiation/post-transplantation total femoral bone marrow cells.<br>
This effect was dose dependent showing, at the three highest doses,<br>
statistically significant, 2-fold increase in cell counts over the PBS<br>
controls.<br>
Example 2<br>
Evaluation of the OGP(10-14) toxicity<br>
A shown above, the OGP(10-14) has been found to enhance the<br>
engraftment of bone marrow transplants. Threfore, prior to further,<br>
detailed analysis of the pharmacological activity of said peptide, the<br>
possible toxicity of said peptide was next evaluated.<br>
Fifty-five mice were evaluated for possible OGP(10-14)-related toxicity<br>
after 15 days of subcutaneous administration, at the dose of 10<br>
nmol/mouse, and results were compared to those obtained in 30<br>
placebo-treated controls. No differences were found concerning survival,<br>
behaviour, body weight gain and gross examination. Concerning the<br>
haematological parameters, administration of the reported doses of<br>
peptide did not induce any significant modifications in the number of<br>
white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (HBO), platelets (PLT) or<br>
haemoglobin (Hb) level.<br>
Example 3<br>
OGP(10-14) Stimulates hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow<br>
chemoablation<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
In this set of experiments bone marrow ablation was induced by an<br>
intraperitoneal injection of cyclophophamide (CFA, SIGMA, 5 mg/mouse<br>
in 150 (1 sterile PBS) for two consecutive days (designated "day 0" and<br>
"day 1". This protocol has been demonstarted to induce severe, reversible<br>
leucopoena with L.D. 
The lowest bone marrow cell counts were recorded six days after the first<br>
injection.<br>
To evaluate the effect of 0GP(10-14) on WBC differential cell counts and<br>
determine the OGP(10-14) "dose of choice" to be used in further<br>
experiments, mice were treated daily by subcutaneous injections of 0.1 ml<br>
OGP(10-14)-free vehicle or vehicle containing different OGP(10-14) doses<br>
as outlined in Fig. 2. One group of reference baseline controls was left<br>
untreated and received neither CFA nor sterile water vehicle with or<br>
without OGP(10-14) (Fig. 2). Blood was collected by retroorbital bleeding<br>
on days -12, -4, +3, +7, +14, +17, +21 and +24 (Fig. 2C). Differential cell<br>
counts were carried out using a Coulter Counter (Sysmex Microcell<br>
Counter F-800).<br>
To test the effect of OGP(10-14) on double positive CD34+/Sca-1+ cells in<br>
the blood comparatively to that of G-CSF, CFA ablated mice were treated<br>
with daily with 10 nmol OGP(10-14) from day -7 until day +7 and blood<br>
samples obtained on days +5, +7 and +15 subjected to flow cytometry.<br>
G-CSF was administered on days +2 to +8.<br>
For the flow cytometry, groups of three blood samples from the mice were<br>
pooled, and mononuclear cells were obtained by gradient centrifugation<br>
and were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 x 106/ml. The cells<br>
were then incubated in the presence of specific monoclonal antibodies<br>
(final dilution 1:10) for 30 min at 4°C. To detect CD34+ cells, purified rat<br>
anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, RAM34) was used as a<br>
first layer. After three washings, the cells were resuspended in PBS and<br>
incubated with a FITC polyclonal goat anti-rat (Pharmingen) To detect<br>
Sca-1+/CD34+ cells, samples were further washed three times in PBS<br>
and incubated with rat anti-mouse Sca-1 (Ly.6A.2) PE from Galtag.<br>
Substituting the primary antibody with an irrelevant immunoglobulin<br>
performed a specific control. Data acquisition and analysis were assessed<br>
by FAC-Scan(tm) (Becton Dickinson) flowcytometer using Lysis II<br>
software (FIG. 3).<br>
To evaluate different dosing regimens of OGP(10-14), chemoablated mice<br>
were subjected to daily treatment with OGP(10-14), as outlined in Fig. 4.<br>
The mice were sacrificed on day +15, the femoral bone marrow was<br>
flushed and single cell suspensions (prepared as above) were subjected to<br>
ex vivo progenitor cell (colony forming) assays. The OGP(10-14) effect on<br>
the formation of CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM and BFU-E was compared to<br>
that of G-CSF (Fig. 4).<br>
Progenitor cell assays<br>
Bone marrow cells were recovered on day +10 after injection of CFA from<br>
all groups. Cells were diluted to 2 x 106/ml in Iscove"a Modified Dulbecco<br>
Medium(IMFM) with 2% FBS and added to methylcellulose medium<br>
according to the manufacturer"s recommendations (MethoCult, StemCell<br>
Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada). 2 x 104 cells were plated in each,<br>
test. Both M3434 (for murine GM-CFU, and GEMM-CFU) and M3334 for<br>
(murine BFU-E assay) were used. M3434 was supplemented with<br>
recombinant murine interleukine-3 (rmIL-3, 10 ng/ml), recombinant<br>
human interleukine-6 (rhIL-6, 10 ng/ml), recombinant murine stem cell<br>
factor (rmSCF, 50 ng/ml) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo,<br>
3 U/ml). InM3434 the only factor included was Epo. Duplicate tests for<br>
each mouse were blindly examined after 14 days of incubation according<br>
to the protocol procedures.<br>
Results<br>
Total and differential WBC counts carried out on day +3 showd a marked<br>
decrease in all CFA-treated groups (Fig. 2). On day 7, there was<br>
approximately 2-fold recovery of total WBC counts in the vehicle treated<br>
chemoablated, which were still considerably lower than the values<br>
recorded in the untreated reference mice. On the other hand, the<br>
OGP(10-14) animals showed higher values at all doses tested, with peak<br>
counts measured in mice receiving 10 nmol OGP(10-14)/day. The counts<br>
in this group approached closely those noted in the untreated reference<br>
group (Fig. 2A). Differential cell counts carried out on day 7 also<br>
demonstrated an OGP(10-14) induced, dose dependent increase in<br>
monocyte and immature cell counts (Figs. 2B, 2C). Monocyte counts at<br>
the maximal dose (10 nmol) were 6-fold higher compared to the normal<br>
reference (Fig. 2B); those of immature cells being also significantly higher<br>
than the reference (Fig. 2C). The total WBC counts in all animal groups<br>
were normal from day 10 and onwards (Fig. 2A). However, the monocyte<br>
counts still presented the same trend seen on day 7 with normal levels<br>
being reached on day 14 (Fig. 2B). In spite of a decrease in immature cell<br>
counts in all but the 0.01 nmol group, the highest values were still<br>
obtained in the 10 nmol group. The immature cell counts were normal in<br>
all groups from day 14 and onwards (Fig. 2C).<br>
The amount of double positive CD34+/Sca-1+ cells on day +5 was 5-fold<br>
higher in the chemoablated animals treated daily with 10 nmol<br>
OGP(10-14) than in mice treated with the vehicle alone (Fig. 3). The<br>
effect of OGP(10-14) was similar to that of G-CSF. Flow cytometry<br>
measurements carried out on days +7 and +15 demonstarted comparable<br>
numbers of the CD34+/Sca-1+ cells. However, on day +15, the<br>
OGP(10-14) treated mice showed a significantly higher number than the<br>
vehicle and G-CSF treated mice (Fig. 3).<br>
The progenitor cell assays showed that OGP(10-14) significantly<br>
stimulates CFU-GEMM and BFU-E, but not CFU-GM. The effect of OGP<br>
was apparent only in instances where the onset of treatment preceded<br>
chemoablation by 7 days (Fig. 4). The absence of an OGP(10-14) effect on<br>
CFU-GM is consistent with its non-significant effect on blood granulocyte<br>
cell counts. G-CSF had an effect only on the CFU-GM (Fig. 4).<br>
Example 4<br>
OGP 10-14 rescues hematopoietic bone marrow cellularity in ex-vivo<br>
samples from patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis<br>
Materials and methods<br>
In order to assess the efficacy of OGP(10-14) in humans, it"s<br>
hematopoietic activity was studied in ex vivo bone marrow specimens<br>
obtain from patients suffering from idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF).<br>
Five IMF patients, one scleroderma patient and two patients with other<br>
myelodisplastic syndromes (MDS) were enrolled in the study after<br>
signing an informed consent. Diagnosis of IMF was performed on the<br>
basis of standard clinical and hematological methods [Barosi, G., et al.,<br>
Br. J. Haematol. 104:730-737 (1999)]. Bone marrow biopsy showing<br>
fibrosis was an essential feature. The diagnosis of IMF was eventually<br>
established after excluding other possible causes of fibrosis and the<br>
presence of different myeloproliferative disorders. In particular, the<br>
diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia was ruled out by excluding<br>
the presence of Ph chromosome and of bcr/abl rearrangement. Three of<br>
the five IMF patients had been previously treated by low doses of<br>
busulfan administered ten days each month and 1 (g 1,25(OH)2D3 /day.<br>
The patients" data are summarized in Table. 1.<br>
Three mm long bone marrow specimens were obtained from the posterior<br>
superior iliac spine by an 8 gauge disposable biopsy needle equipped with<br>
a trap to ensure minimal distortion of the specimen (TraoSystem<br>
MDThech, USA). The specimens were divided into three,l cm long<br>
portions. One randomly selected portion was used for preliminary<br>
morphological assessment. The remaining two fragments were cultured<br>
in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and completely covered by 1 ml of<br>
Dexter-like medium, in the presence of rhSCF (50 ng/mL), rhGM-CSF (10<br>
ng/mL), rhIL-3 (10 ng/mL), and rhEpo (2 units/mL) with or without 10-8M<br>
OGP(10-14), at 37°C, 5% CO2-air. Half the medium was changed once,<br>
after 7 days, without altering its composition, other than restoring<br>
cytokines and OGP(10-14) initial concentration. After additional seven<br>
days in culture the bone marrow specimens were histologically processed.<br>
Briefly, samples were fixed in modified B5, demineralized in E.D.T.A acid<br>
buffer and sections were stained with Giemsa, hematoxylin-eosin or<br>
silver impregnation of reticulum. Changes in the bone marrow were<br>
assessed semiquantitatively on a I to IV score. A score of TV was used for<br>
cell-rich bone marrow specimens comparable to normal ones; score HI<br>
represented reduced cellularity with reduced nuclear density; score II<br>
specimens exhibited spread lacunae; hematopoietic cells in score I<br>
specimens were extremely scanty and/or the bone marrow area was<br>
vastly substituted by lacunar zones. At least 3 equispaced histological<br>
sections per sample were examined using the entire section area. In<br>
addition, the ceE density was automatically evaluated using a computer<br>
assisted Leica microscope equipped with Leica QWin software, as the<br>
ratio between cell counts and bone marrow area. The results for each<br>
patient results were expressed as the ratio of mean cell density in<br>
OGP(10-14) treated, over untreated specimens (T/C ratio).<br>
Results<br>
After 14 days in culture, bone marrow specimens treated with<br>
OGP(10-14) appear richer in hematopoietic cells than OGP(10-14)-free<br>
specimens from the same patients (Figs. 5, 6). The semiquantitative score<br>
was significantly increased in all IMF patients (p
were detected between OGP(10-14) treated and untxaeted specimens<br>
from non IMF patients. The computer assisted evaluation of cellularity<br>
showed a T/C ratio&gt;1 in all IMF cases (p
cell number was increased in the OGP(10-14)-treated specimens.<br>
Moreover, the T/C ratio was statistically significant in every pair of<br>
specimens obtained from individual patients (Table. 2). The T/C ratio<br>
showed a very high and significant inverse correlation with the patients"<br>
hemoglobin level (Fig. 7). Decreased hemoglobin levels are the most<br>
important serological indicator for the severity of IMF. This correlation<br>
therefore strongly suggests that the effect of OGP(10-14) is highest in the<br>
more severely affected patients.<br>
The ratio between erythroid and myeloid cells was apparently unchanged<br>
after culturing with OGP(10-14). However, a semiquantitative<br>
assessment suggested a 1.5 to 10-fold decrease in the number of<br>
megakaryocytes in specimens obtained from IMF patients. As in the case<br>
of overall hematopietic cellularity, such differences were not found in<br>
samples obtained from the non-IMF patients.<br>
