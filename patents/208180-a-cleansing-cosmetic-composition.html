THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br><br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10, RULE 13)<br>
-IMPROVED DETERGENT COMPOSITIONâ€”<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of This invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition, suitable for delivering   superior conditioning benefits on  substrates such as hair skin and the like by the  <br>
enhanced deposition of benefit agents in particular, silicones to substrates such as hair, skin and the like The cosmetic composition can be provided in variety of formulations, in particular, rinse-off cleansing or care formulations for cosmetic applications. The composition provides superior conditioning while delivering  excellent  cleansing. -The  invention also  relates to method for superior <br>
conditioning of substrates such as skin, hair and the like using the cosmetic composition of the invention.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Silicones are known to provide a light, silky feel on hair and skin. Their effectiveness is dependent on the extent of deposition However, for cleansing products, since the surfactants present are engaged in the removal of oil from the substrate, mere addition of silicone(s) oil into the composition does not serve any purpose, as they get washed off. The art talks about various methods to increase deposition of silicones from the cosmetic cleansing compositions. The routes referred to include using blends of silicones and/or modified silicones, cationic polymers as deposition aids and special surfactant systems.US 4,70,314<br>
teaches an aqueous composition, stable on storage, comprising soap, silicone cationic polymer, cationic surfactant and cationic polymer. The cationic silicone polymer referred to is limited to the class of amodimethicones which has been specifically proposed to achieve the desired storage, stability of anioinic surfactants with cationic compounds and does not deal with desired deposition levels of silicones on substrates<br><br><br>
disclosed the possible use of silicone component consisting essentially of a mixture of silicon gum and silicone fluid to achieve durable skin conditioning, superior smooth and soft skin feel, lather and improved rinsing.<br><br><br>
ORGN <br>
While this prior art also makes use of silicone compounds for mild skin cleansing the same does not specifically traverse the need for improving the level of silicone deposition and related benefits.<br>
US 5,981,465 teaches a method for increasing surface deposition of silicone from soap and improving processing characteristics of soap and a corresponding composition are disclosed. The composition includes a fatty alkyl silicone, a fatty silicate ester, a high viscosity lower alkyl silicone fluid, a silicone surfactant, and an organic surfactant. The organic surfactant is one or more of a nonionic, cationic or anionic surfactants.<br>
US 2002/0082174 A1 also talks about achieving efficient deposition of cosmetically active ingredient onto skin or hair and disclosed a cleansing cosmetic composition containing a anionic, cationic, amphoteric surfactants or mixtures thereof, with an alkoxylated nonionic surfactant as co-surfactant, a water insoluble component and a cationic conditioning polymer. While the composition is stated to deliver improved silicone deposition, good cleansing and conditioning it is however, limited to systems with a maximum surfactant content or the detergent active content of 60%, which is a mix of surfactants and co-surfactants.<br>
Our co-pending application teaches a cationized silicone composition for the efficient delivery of cationized silicone comprising a cationized silicone active selected from one or more of (a) a cationized fatty alkuyl silicone copolymer (b) cationized dimethiconol complex and (c) cationized high viscosity lower alkyl silicone fluid having viscosity of 0.5 x 106 - 600 x 106cp with or without cationized silicone gum blend.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that while it is well known that silicones constitute active benefit ingredient for various cosmetic formulations, its selection and form or incorporation in various cosmetic formulations is important to achieve the desired stability, compatibility with various other ingredients and importantly the effective deposition of the silicones onto said substrates as benefit agents. Importantly, as would be apparent from the above state of the art, surfactants constitute the basic constituent of a cleansing composition and cleansing/cosmetic formulations incorporating silicones as benefit agent need to be compatible with various surfactant systems for effective and wide application/use of silicones as benefit agents in cosmetic formulations.   Moreover,<br>
3<br><br>
considering that compositions with higher detergent active compositions are common it is also important to be able to achieve superior silicone deposition and hence conditioning from suchcomposition without any limitation in levels of active detergent in such formulations<br>
Objects of invention:<br>
It thus has been the basic objective of the invention to provide for a wide range of  cleansing cosmetic composition with  selective cationised silicone active Which' would serve for effective delivery of the silicones as the benefit agent onto substrates such as hair, skin and the like.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide a wide range of synergistic cleansing cosmetic formulations comprising selective cationised silicone active which would serve for enhanced delivery of the silicones as the benefit agent onto substrates such as hair, skin and the like.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to cleansing cosmetic composition comprising selective cationised silicone delivery systems which would be stable and compatible with any variety of conventional surfactant system and achieve desired delivery and retention of silicone benefit agent on any biological substrate even as a rinse-off product.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to cleansing cosmetic composition comprising selective cationised silicone delivery systems which would be stable and compatible with any variety of conventional surfactant system and achieve desired delivery and retention of silicone benefit agent on any biological substrate to achieve superior conditioning without any limitations in level of detergent active.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide an improved method of treating substrates such as hair, skin and the like whereby it would be<br>
4<br><br>
possible to achieve effective deposition of silicone benefit agent onto such substrates even by applying rinse-off formulations.<br>
