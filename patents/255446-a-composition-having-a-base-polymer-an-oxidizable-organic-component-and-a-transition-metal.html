OXYGEN SCAVENGING COMPOSITIONS AND PACKAGING COMPRISING SAID<br>
COMPOSITIONS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. Application No. 60/652,888 filed<br>
February 15,2005, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to substantially transparent compositions that<br>
comprise a base polymer, an oxidizable organic component, and a transition metal. The<br>
invention also concerns use of such compositions in the construction of packaging for oxygen<br>
sensitive materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] It is known in the art to include an oxygen scavenger in the packaging structure<br>
for the protection of oxygen sensitive materials. Such scavengers are believed to react with<br>
oxygen that is trapped in the package or that permeates from outside of the package, thus<br>
extending to life of package contents. These packages include films, bottles, containers, and the<br>
like. Food, beverages (such as beer and fruit juices), cosmetics, medicines, and the like are<br>
particularly sensitive to oxygen exposure and require high barrier properties to oxygen to<br>
preserve the freshness of the package contents and avoid changes in flavor, texture and color.<br>
[0004] Use of certain polyamides in combination with a transition metal is known to be<br>
useful as the oxygen scavenging material. One particularly useful polyamide is MXD6 which<br><br>
co tains meta xylene residued in the polymer chain. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,639,815; 5,049,624; and 5,021,515.<br>
[0005] Other oxygen scavengers include potassium sulfite (U.S. Patent No. 4,536,409),<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons (U.S. Patent No. 5,211,875), and ascorbic acid derivatives (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,075,362).<br>
[0006] In barrier layers of packaging walls that are made from blends of oxygen<br>
scavenging materials with base polymer resins such as PET, haze can result due to such factors<br>
as: the immiscibility of the scavenging materials with the base polymer resins, and the inability<br>
to create by mechanical blending means disperse-phase domains that are so small as not to<br>
interfere with the passage of light therethrough; and the adverse influence of the scavenging<br>
material on the crystallization behavior of PET base resin. One approach to minimizing such<br>
haze is careful selection of base resin to improve dispersibility of the scavenger material and,<br>
thus, reduce, but not substantially eliminate, haze; and to minimize the adverse crystallization<br>
effect. This approach may undesirably narrowly restrict the choice of base polymer resin.<br>
Another approach is to use compositions that serve as compatibilizers to reduce haze. These<br>
approaches add cost to the layer and the compatibilizer adds an additional material that must be<br>
evaluated for its suitability for contact with food. There is a need in the art for barrier materials<br>
which provide high oxygen scavenging capability and are substantially transparent without use<br>
of the aforementioned measures.<br>

[0044] The term "alkyl" refers to a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
chain. Alkyl groups have straight and branched chains. In some embodiments, alkyls have from<br>
1 to 12 carbon atoms or 1 to 6 carbon atoms, unless explicitly specified otherwise. Alkyl groups<br>
include, bur are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, I-butyl and t-butyl.<br>
Specifically included within the definition of "alkyl" are those aliphatic hydrocarbon chains that<br>
are optionally substituted.<br>
[0045] The term "alkoxy," as used herein, refers to the group R-O- where R is an alkyl<br>
group as defined herein.<br>
[0046] The term "aryl" is defined herein as an aromatic carbocyclic moiety of up to 20<br>
carbon atoms. In some embodiments, aryl groups have 6-20 carbon atoms or 6-14 carbon atoms.<br>
Aryls may be a single ring (monocyclic) or multiple rings (bicyclic, up to three rings) fused<br>
together or linked covalently. Any suitable ring position of the aryl moiety may be covalently<br>
linked to the defined chemical structure. Aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, 1-<br>
naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, dihydronaphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, biphenyl. anthryl, phenanthryl,<br>
fluorenyl, indanyl, biphenylenyl, acenaphthenyl, and acenaphthylenyl. In some embodiments,<br>
phenyl is a preferred aryl. Aryl groups may also be optionally substituted with one or more<br>
substituents.<br>
[0047] The term "aryloxy" refers to the group -O-Ar where Ar is an aryl group as<br>
defined herein.<br>
[0048] The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic heterocyclic ring system, which may<br>
be a single ring (monocyclic) or multiple rings (bicyclic, up to three rings) fused together or<br>
linked covalently and having for example 5 to 20 ring members. The rings may contain from<br>
one to four hetero atoms selected from nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or sulfur (S), wherein the<br>
nitrogen or sulfur atom(s) are optionally oxidized, or the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally<br>
substituted (e.g., by alkyl such as methyl) or quarternized. Any suitable ring position of the<br>
heteroaryl moiety may be covalently linked to the defined chemical structure. Exemplary<br>
heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, pyrryl, furyl, pyridyl, pyridine-N-oxide, 1,2,4-<br>
thiadiazolyl, pyrimidyl, thienyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidyl,<br>
quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thiophenyl, benzothienyl, isobenzofuryl, pyrazolyl, indolyl, purinyl,<br>
carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, and isoxazolyl.<br>
[0049] Optional substituents for alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or heteroaryl groups are well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. These substituents include alkyl, alkoxy,<br><br><br>
-SR19,arloxy,hydroxy, NR19R20,acetyl, cyano, nitro, glyceryl, and carbohydrate, or two<br>
substituents taken together may be linked as an -alkylene- group to form a ring. R19 and R20 are<br>
as defined herein.<br>
[0050] It is believed that some composition, under certain circumstances, can produce<br>
an amount of benzylaldehyde derivative upon decomposition. As such, it is desirable that any<br>
substituents on aryl groups be ones that do not produce a pronounced flavor or odor. Such<br>
compositions are easily determined by one skilled in the art and can be taken into considerations<br>
when selecting substituents for aryl groups.<br>
[0051] A surprising result of the oxygen scavenging reaction of some of these oxygen<br>
scavenger materials comprising benzyl amides is that the decomposition products resulting from<br>
the catalytic oxidation by transition metal in the positive oxidation state, according to this<br>
invention, (some decomposition products may also result from melt processing of the materials)<br>
are benzyl aldehydes, which may be toxicologically innocuous. Benzaldehyde, from the<br>
oxidative decomposition of Monomer I, is a natural flavorant, and is generally recognized as safe<br>
for use in foods or for packaging in contact with foods. This innocuousness is highly desirable in<br>
food packaging. Other benzyl amines may be chosen such that the decomposition products are<br>
aldehydes that are believed to be innocuous. These include 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde<br>
(also known as vanillaldehye or vanillin), 3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3-<br>
methylbenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde-3-<br>
sulfonic acid sodium salt, (l,l'-bihenyl)-4-carboxaldehyde, 2-methoxybenzaldehyde 4-<br>
nitropheynylhydrazone, 3,4,5-triacetoxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, 3-<br>
benzoxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt, 4-<br>
dodecyloxyenzaldehyde, benzaldehyde-p-sulfonic acid sodium salt, 3-benzoxybenzaldehyde, 3-<br>
phenoxybenzaldehyde, 5-nitrovanillin, ethyl vanillin beta-D-glucopyranoside, 1,4-benzodioxan-<br>
6-carboxaldehyde, 3,4-didecyloxybenzaldehyde, 4-benzyloxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, N-ethyl-<br>
N-hydroxyethyl-2-methyl-4-aminobenzaldehyde, 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde, 4-<br>
methoxybenzaldehyde-3-sulfonic acid sodium salt, 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, 4-(4-<br>
nitrobenzyloxy)benzaldehyde, 4-octylbenzaldehyde, 2-hexyloxybenzaldehyde, 3,4-<br>
didodecyloxybenzaldehyde, 3,4-dioctyloxybenzaldehyde, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 3-(4-tert-butylphenoxy)benzaldehyde. While the effectiveness in<br>
packaging applications as oxygen scavengers may be somewhat different from one substituted<br>
benzyl amine to another, the advantages in the aldehyde decomposition product having reduced<br>
sensory detection limits may be a good tradeoff, and this can be determined by reasonable<br>
experimentation and testing with the products to be packaged.<br><br><br>
[0052] In general, it is beheved that larger benzaldehydes and their salts have less<br>
intense flavors. It is also believed that benzaldehydes having at least one sugar substituent will<br>
have less flavor than unsubstituted analogs. Examples of suitable sugars include glucose,<br>
sucrose, and lactose.<br>
[0053] "Carbohydrate" as used herein refers to monosaccharides, disaccharides, and<br>
trisaccharides. Suitable carbohydrates include glucose, sucrose, and lactose. A carbohydrate<br>
substituent may be bound at any suitable position.<br>
[0054] The term "alkenyl" is defined herein as (C2-C20) straight chain or branched-<br>
chain bivalent hydrocarbon moiety derived from an alkane or alkene that is mono or<br>
polyunsaturated. Such groups include those in the E or Z configurations and all possible<br>
combinations of E and Z configurations. Some preferred alkylene chains have 2-7 carbon atoms.<br>
[0055] The carbon number as used in the definitions recited herein refers to carbon<br>
backbone and carbon branching and does not include any carbon atoms that are contained in the<br>
optional substituents.<br>
[0056] Compositions of the instant invention comprise a base polymer. In some<br>
embodiments, the base polymer is a polyester. In certain embodiments, the polyester polymers<br>
of the invention are thermoplastic and, thus, the form of the compositions are not limited and can<br>
include a composition in the melt phase polymerization, as an amorphous pellet, as a solid stated<br>
polymer, as a semi-crystalline particle, as a composition of matter in a melt processing zone, as a<br>
bottle preform, or in the form of a stretch blow molded bottle or other articles. In certain<br>
preferred embodiments, the polyester is polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
[0057] Examples of suitable polyester polymers include polyethylene terephthalate<br>
homopolymers and copolymers modified with one or more polycarboxylic acid modifiers in a<br>
cumulative amount of less than about 15 mole %, or about 10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole %<br>
or less, or one or more hydroxyl compound modifiers in an amount of less than about 60 mol %,<br>
or less than about 50 mole %, or less than about 40 mole %, or less than about 15 mole %, or<br>
about 10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or less (collectively referred to for brevity as "PET")<br>
and polyethylene naphthalate homopolymers and copolymers modified with a cumulative<br>
amount of with less than about 15 mole %, or about 10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or<br>
less, of one or more polycarboxylic acid modifiers or modified less than about 60 mol %, or less<br>
than about 50 mole %, or less than about 40 mole %, or less than about 15 mole %, or about 10<br>
mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or less of one or more hydroxyl compound modifiers<br>
(collectively referred to herein as "PEN"), and blends of PET and PEN. A modifier<br>
polycarboxylic acid compound or hydroxyl compound is a compound other than the compound<br><br><br>
contained in an amount of least about 85 mole %. The preferred polyester polymer is<br>
polyalkylene terephthalate, and most preferred is PET.<br>
[0058] The polyester compositions can be prepared by polymerization procedures<br>
known in the art sufficient to effect esterification and polycondensation. Polyester melt phase<br>
manufacturing processes include direct condensation of a dicarboxylic acid with the diol,<br>
optionally in the presence of esterification catalysts, in the esterification zone, followed by<br>
polycondensation in the prepolymer and finishing zones in the presence of a polycondensation<br>
catalyst; or ester exchange usually in the presence of a transesterification catalyst in the ester<br>
exchange zone, followed by prepolymerization and finishing in the presence of a<br>
polycondensation catalyst, and each may optionally be solid stated according to known methods.<br>
[0059] Other base polymers may be used with the instant invention. One example is<br>
polypropylene.<br>
[0060] The transition metal used in the instant compositions is a metal in the positive<br>
oxidation state. It should be noted that it is contemplated that one or more such metals may be<br>
used. In some embodiments, cobalt is added in +2 or +3 oxidation state. In some embodiments,<br>
it is preferred to use cobalt in the +2 oxidation state. In certain embodiments, copper in the +2<br>
oxidation state is utilized. In some embodiments, rhodium in the +2 oxidation state is used. In<br>
certain embodiments, zinc may also be added to the composition. Preferred zinc compounds<br>
include those in a positive oxidation state.<br>
[0061] Suitable counter-ions to the transition metal cations include carboxylates, such<br>
as neodecanoates, octanoates, acetates, lactates, naphthalates, malates, stearates,<br>
acetylacetonates, linoleates, oleates, palmitates, 2-ethylhexanoates, or ethylene glycolates; or as<br>
their oxides, borates, carbonates, chlorides, dioxides, hydroxides, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates,<br>
or silicates among others.<br>
[0062] In some embodiments, levels of at least about 10 ppm, or at least about 50 ppm,<br>
or at least about 100 ppm of metal can achieve suitable oxygen scavenging levels. The exact<br>
amount of transition metal used in an application can be determined by trials that are well within<br>
the skill level of one skilled in the art. In some embodiments involving wall applications (as<br>
opposed to master batch applications where more catalyst is used), it is preferred to keep the<br>
level of metal below about 300 ppm and, in other embodiments, preferably below about 250<br>
ppm. In master batch compositions, the level of transition metal may range from about 1000 to<br>
about 10,000 ppm. In some preferred embodiments, the range is from about 2000 to about 5000<br>
ppm.<br><br><br>
[0063] The transition metal or metals may be added neat or in a carrier (such as a liquid<br>
or wax) to an extruder or other device for making the article, or the metal may be present in a<br>
concentrate or carrier with the oxidizable organic component, in a concentrate or carrier with a<br>
base polymer, or in a concentrate or carrier with a base polymer/oxidizable organic component<br>
blend. Alternatively, at least a portion of the transition metal may be added as a polymerization<br>
catalyst to the melt phase reaction for making the base polymer (a polyester polymer in some<br>
embodiments) and be present as residual metals when the polymer is fed to the melting zone (e.g.<br>
the extrusion or injection molding zone) for making the article such as a preform or sheet. It is<br>
desirable that the addition of the transition metal does not substantially increase the intrinsic<br>
viscosity (It. V) of the melt in the melt processing zone. Thus, transition metal or metals may be<br>
added in two or more stages, such as once during the melt phase for the production of the<br>
polyester polymer and again once more to the melting zone for making the article.<br>
[0064] The compositions of the instant invention comprise at least one non-polymeric<br>
oxidizable organic component present in an amount of about 0.10 to 10 weight present of the<br>
composition and the component comprising at least one compound of the formula E-(L-E)X<br>
wherein:<br><br>
L is a linking group of the formula -(O-R21)z-O-, -(NH-R21)2-NH-, -(NH-C(=O)R22)t,-NH,<br>
-NH-R25-NH(C(=O)R26NHR25NH)u-, -(O-R23-O-R24-C(=O)s-O- where L is attached to a carbon<br>
atom of Ar in structure (I) or where R12 or R13 of structure (II) is L;<br>
x is 0,1, or 2;<br>
Ar is aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R1, R2, and R11 are each independently, H, C1-C12 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C6-C20 aryloxy,<br>
hydroxy, C2-C6 alkenyl, NR19R20, acetyl, nitro, glyceryl, carbohydrate, -C(=O)H, L, or two R1 or<br>
two R2 groups can form a group of the formula -O-R18-O;<br>
R3, R4, R14, and R15 are each H;<br><br><br>
R5 to R10 and R16, and R17 are each, independently, H or C1-C3 alkyl;<br>
R12 and R13 are each, independently, H, C1-C6 alkyl, C6-C20 aryl, C1-C6 alkoxy, or L;<br>
R18 is C2-C6 alkyl;<br>
R19 and R20 are each, independently, H, C1-C6 alkyl, or C6-C20 aryl;<br>
R21 and R24 are each, independently, C1-C6 alkyl;<br>
R22, R23, R25 and R26 are each, independently, C1-C6 alkyl or C6-C20 aryl;<br>
n and p are independently 0 or an integer from 1 to 5;<br>
q is 0 or an integer from 1 to 4;<br>
s and z are, independently 1,2, or 3; and<br>
t and u are, independently 1 or 2.<br>
[0065] In some embodiments, the compositions comprise at least one monomer of the<br>
formula:<br><br>
[0066] At least one of these monomers described herein normally will be used in an<br>
amount of about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent in an article based on the weight of the<br>
composition. In some preferred embodiments, the monomer(s) will be present in an amount of<br>
about 1 to about 5 weight percent based on the weight of the composition. In other<br>
embodiments, the monomer(s) will be present in an amount of about 1 to about 3 weight percent<br>
based on the weight of the composition.<br><br>
[0067] In master batec solution the amount of monomer will typically be from about<br>
10 to about 90 weight percent based on the weight of the composition. In some preferred<br>
embodiments, the amount of monomer will be from about 20 to about 80 weight percent based<br>
on the weight of the composition.<br>
[0068] The compounds described herein, including monomers I and II, can be made by<br>
standard synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, one could derive<br>
monomer-I by reacting adipic acid and benzyl amine. Monomer-II could be made by reacting m-<br>
xylene diamne with a formic acid derivative.<br>
[0069] In addition, to the monomers discussed in the preceding paragraph. The<br>
compositions of the invention can contain one or more additional oxygen scavenging materials.<br>
These materials may be polymeric, oligomeric, or monomeric in nature. One suitable material is<br>
MXD6, a polyamide, that is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,639,815. Other suitable materials are<br>
polyolefins which can be added as blended material or as a unit within the base polymer moiety.<br>
See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,083,585.<br>
[0070] The composition may also include other components such as pigments, fillers,<br>
crystallization aids, impact modifiers, surface lubricants, denesting agents, stabilizers, ultraviolet<br>
light absorbing agents, metal deactivators, nucleating agents such as polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene, phosphate stabilizers and dyestuffs. Other additional components are well known<br>
to those skilled in the art and can be added to the existing composition so long as they do not<br>
negatively impact the performance of the compositions. In particular, it is known that certain<br>
metal ions are to be avoided since they tend to poison the catalytic effect of the transition metal<br>
catalysts of the here-in described invention. Typically, the total quantity of such components<br>
will be less than about 10% by weight relative to the whole composition. In some embodiments,<br>
the amount of these optional components is less than about 5%, by weight relative to the total<br>
composition.<br>
[0071] A common additive used in the manufacture of polyester polymer compositions<br>
used to make stretch blow molded bottles is a reheat additive because the preforms made from<br>
the composition must be reheated prior to entering the mold for stretch blowing into a bottle.<br>
Any of the conventional reheat additives can be used, such additives include various forms of<br>
black particles, e.g. carbon black, activated carbon, black iron oxide, glassy carbon, and silicon<br>
carbide; the gray particles such as antimony, and other reheat additives such as silicas, red iron<br>
oxide, and so forth.<br>
[0072] In many applications, not only are the packaging contents sensitive to the<br>
ingress of oxygen, but the contents may also be affected by UV light. Fruit juices and<br><br><br>
pharmaceuticals are tow examples contents. Accordingly, in some embodiments, it is<br>
desirable to incorporate into the polyester composition any one of the known UV absorbing<br>
compounds in amounts effective to protect the packaged contents so long as the compounds do<br>
not negatively impact performance.<br>
[0073] The instant compositions can be made by mixing a base polymer (PET, for<br>
example) with the oxidizable organic component and the transition metal composition. Such<br>
compositions can be made by any method known to those skilled in the art. In certain<br>
embodiments, some or part of the transition metal may exist in the base polymer prior to mixing.<br>
This residual metal, for example, can exist from the manufacturing process of the base polymer.<br>
In some embodiments, the base polymer, the oxidizable organic component and the transition<br>
metal are mixed by tumbling in a hopper. Other optional ingredients can be added during this<br>
mixing process or added to the mixture after the aforementioned mixing or to an individual<br>
component prior to the aforementioned mixing step.<br>
[0074] The instant composition can also be made by adding each ingredient separately<br>
and mixing the ingredients prior melt processing the composition to form an article. In some<br>
embodiments, the mixing can be just prior to the melt process zone. In other embodiments, one<br>
or more ingredients can be premixed in a separate step prior to bringing all of the ingredients<br>
together.<br>
[0075] The oxidizable organic component can be added in pure form or may be treated<br>
with a low molecular weight organic wax like compound to prepare a prill or bead like material<br>
for ease of dosing during the injection molding process.<br>
[0076] In some embodiments, the invention concerns use of the compositions described<br>
herein as a component of a wall that is used in a package for oxygen sensitive materials. The<br>
necessary scavenging capacity of a package will generally have to be greater for walls that have<br>
a greater permeance in the absence of scavenging additives. Accordingly, a commercially useful<br>
effect is harder to achieve when inherently higher permeance materials are used, unless the layer<br>
is protected, such as with a layer of polymer or other material, to reduce the O2 flux reaching the<br>
scavenging composition. Such constructions may find particular applicability where the<br>
requirement is for rapid headspace-O2 evacuation, or in containers for O2-sensitive products that<br>
also require walls with low permeance to water vapor.<br>
[0077] The wall may be a rigid one, a flexible sheet, or a clinging film. It may be<br>
homogenous or a laminate or coated with other polymers. If it is laminated or coated, then the<br>
scavenging property may reside in a layer of the wall the permeance of which is relatively high<br>
in the absence of scavenging and which alone would not perform very satisfactorily but which<br><br><br>
performs satisfactorily in combination with one or more other layers which have a relatively low<br>
permeance but negligible or insufficient oxygen-scavenging properties. A single such layer could<br>
be used on the outside of the package since this is the side from which oxygen primarily comes<br>
when the package is filled and sealed. However, such a layer to either side of the scavenging<br>
layer would reduce consumption of scavenging capacity prior to filling and sealing.<br>
[0078] When the instant compositions are used in a wall or as a layer of a wall, the<br>
permeability of the composition for oxygen is advantageously not more than about 3.0, or about<br>
1.7, or about 0.7, or about 0.2, or about 0.03 cm3 mm/(m2 atm day). The permeability of the<br>
composition provided by the present invention is advantageously not more than about three-<br>
quarters of that in the absence of oxygen-scavenging properties. In some embodiments, the<br>
permeability is not more than about one half, one-tenth in certain embodiments, one twenty-fifth<br>
in other embodiments, and not more than one-hundredth in yet other embodiments of that in the<br>
absence of oxygen-scavenging properties. The permeability in the absence of oxygen-scavenging<br>
properties is advantageously not more than about 17 cm3 mm/(m2 atm day), or about 10, and or<br>
about 6. A particularly good effect can be achieved for such permeabilities in the range from<br>
about 0.5, or about 1.0, to 10, or about 6.0, cm3 mm/(m2 atm day). Measurements of oxygen<br>
permeation can be made by methods described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,639,815, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
[0079] In another aspect, the instant composition can be used as a master batch for<br>
blending with a polymer or a polymer containing component. In such compositions, the<br>
concentration of the oxidizable organic component and the transition metal will be higher to<br>
allow for the final blended product to have suitable amounts of these components. The master<br>
batch may also contain an amount of the polymer to which the master batch is to be blended<br>
with. In other embodiments, the master batch may contain a polymer that is compatible with the<br>
polymer that the master batch is to be blended with.<br>
[0080] In yet another aspect, the compositions of the instant invention can be used for<br>
forming a layer of a wall which primarily provides oxygen-scavenging (another layer including<br>
polymer providing gas barrier without significant scavenging), or as a head-space scavenger<br>
(completely enclosed, together with the package contents, by a package wall). Such techniques<br>
are well know to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0081] The time period for which the permeability is maintained can be extended by<br>
storing the articles in sealed containers or under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen prior to use<br>
with oxygen sensitive materials. Such a scheme may prove beneficial where performs or rolls of<br>
film or sheet are to be stored for long periods prior to further packaging-conversion operations.<br><br><br>
[0082] In another aspect, the invention provides a package, whether rigid, semi-rigid,<br>
collapsible, lidded, or flexible or a combination of these, comprising a wall as formed from the<br>
compositions described herein. Such packages can be formed by methods well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
[0083] Among the techniques that may be used to make articles are molding generally,<br>
injection molding, stretch blow molding, extrusion, thermoforming, extrusion blow molding, and<br>
(specifically for multilayer structures) co-extrusion and lamination using adhesive tie layers.<br>
Orientation, e.g. by stretch blow molding, of the polymer is especially attractive with phthalate<br>
polyesters because of the known mechanical advantages that result.<br>
[0084] Specific articles include preforms, containers and films for packaging of food,<br>
beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products where a high oxygen barrier<br>
is needed. Examples of beverage containers for which the instant invention are particularly<br>
useful are bottles for containing juices, sport drinks, beer or any other beverage where oxygen<br>
detrimentally affects the flavor, fragrance, performance (prevent vitamin degradation), or color<br>
of the drink. The compositions of the instant invention are also particularly useful as a sheet for<br>
thermoforming into rigid packages, and as films for flexible-package structures. Rigid packages<br>
include food trays and lids. Examples of food tray applications include dual ovenable food trays,<br>
or cold storage food trays, both in the base container and in the lidding (whether a thermoformed<br>
lid or a flexible film), where the freshness of the food contents can decay with the ingress of<br>
oxygen. The compositions of the instant invention also find use in the manufacture of cosmetic<br>
containers and containers for pharmaceuticals or medical devices.<br>
[0085] The package walls of the instant invention can be a single layer or a multilayer<br>
constructions. In some embodiments using multilayer walls, the outer and inner layers may be<br>
structural layers with one or more further layers. Any of the layers may contain the oxygen<br>
scavenging material of this invention. In some embodiments, the outer and inner layers comprise<br>
and polyolefin or a polyester. In the most-preferred embodiments, a single layer design is<br>
preferred. Such a design may have advantages in simplicity of manufacture and cost, without<br>
sacrifice of the transparency of the polyester base polymer.<br>
[0086] As used herein, the terms "a", "an", "the" and the like refer to both the singular<br>
and plural unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. "A bottle", for example, refers to a<br>
single bottle or more than one bottle.<br>
[0087] Also as used herein, the description of one or more method steps does not<br>
preclude the presence of additional method steps before or after the combined recited steps.<br>
Additional steps may also be intervening steps to those described. In addition, it is understood<br><br><br>
that the lettering of process steps or ingredients is a convenient means for identifying discrete<br>
activities or ingredients and the recited lettering can be arranged in any sequence.<br>
[0088] Where a range of numbers is presented in the application, it is understood that<br>
the range includes all integers and fractions thereof between the stated range limits. A range of<br>
numbers expressly includes numbers less than the stated endpoints and those in-between the<br>
stated range. A range of from 1-3, for example, includes the integers one, two, and three as well<br>
as any fractions that reside between these integers.<br>
[0089] As used herein, "master batch" refers to a mixture of base polymer, oxidizable<br>
organic component, and transition metal that will be diluted, typically with at least additional<br>
base polymer, prior to forming an article. As such, the concentrations of oxidizable organic<br>
component and transition metal are higher than in the formed article.<br>
[0090] As used herein, the term "combining" includes blending or reacting the<br>
components that are combined.<br>
Examples<br>
[0091] The instant invention is illustrated by the following examples that are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention. N,N' - bis (phenylmethyl) Hexane diamide<br>
(referred to as Monomer -I, CAS Registry No: 25344 - 24- 5) and N,N' - [1,3-<br>
phenylenebis(methylene)] bis Acetamide (referred to as Monomer - II, CAS Registry No:<br>
131711-99-4) were prepared by Sigma Aldrich.<br><br><br><br>
Monomer - II<br>
Example 1<br>
[0092] Extruded strips were prepared using a bench-top Killion extruder (with typical<br>
extruder output rate between 8-10 lbs / hour) for evaluating oxygen scavenging potential using<br>
oxy-sense™ for Monomer-I and Monomer-H. The temperature profile across different extruder<br>
zones used was typical to that used for PET (about 525 °F). Extruded films were cut into thin<br>
strips and about 2g samples for each formulation were sealed into 22 mL glass vials and stored at<br>
elevated temperature (70 °C). The % oxygen depletion inside the vials over time was monitored<br>
using commercially available oxy-senseTM instrument. Different formulations and their<br>
respective code names are given below:<br>
1.	PET + 3% 6007 + 100 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: T10)<br>
2.	PET + 3% Monomer -1 +100 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-13-100)<br>
3.	PET + 3% Monomer -1 + 200 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-13-200)<br>
4.	PET + 5% Monomer -1 + 100 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-15-100)<br>
5.	PET + 5% Monomer -1 + 200 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-15-200)<br>
6.	PET + 3% Monomer -11 + 100 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-II3-100)<br>
7.	PET + 3% Monomer -11 + 200 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-II 3-200)<br>
8.	PET + 5% Monomer -11 + 100 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-II 5-100)<br>
9.	PET + 5% Monomer - H + 200 ppm Co carboxylate powder (Code: M-II 5-200)<br>
[0093] Actual Monomer I and Monomer II content as well as the cobalt content in the<br>
extruded strips were not verified. Graphs in Figures 2 and 3 show the % oxygen depletion in the<br>
vials over time. It can be seen that while Monomer-I shows limited scavenging, some of the<br>
Monomer-II compositions scavenge as well as the Monoxbar™ control sample (T10).<br>
[0094] It is evident that Monomer-I and Monomer-II have oxygen scavenging potential<br>
based on oxy-sense™ data and further testing was performed by manufacturing actual blown<br>
containers.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
[0095] Preforms were injection molded on a 2 cavity Husky LX160 PET injection<br>
molding machine. Preforms were made with the following formulations:<br>
Heat Wave™( Voridian) PET + 3% Monomer -1 + 75 ppm Co carboxylate powder<br>
Heat Wave PET + 3% Monomer -11 + 75 ppm Co carboxylate powder<br>
[0096] PET, Monomer-I (in powder form) and Cobalt carboxylate mixture (cobalt<br>
neodeconate (Co NDA, CAS # 27253-31-2) and cobalt propionate (CAS# 1560-69-6) mixture<br>
with a 20.5% Co metal content) were tumble blended in a bucket and fed into the machine<br>
hopper. Actual final composition in the preform was not verified. Bottles were blown on the unit<br>
cavity Re-heat and blow lab machine for oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and haze<br>
measurement.<br>
Monomer -I Trial Results:<br>
[0097] 20 oz bottles were blown form preforms and stored empty at STP conditions<br>
prior to testing. Two sets of the empty bottles were mounted on an oxygen permeation measuring<br>
device - similar to MoCon Oxtran analyzer. The first set (A) were mounted 2 days after<br>
manufacture, and the second set (B) were mounted 69 days after manufacture. Results are<br>
shown in Figure 4 where:<br>
A.	2 days after manufacture (-O-)<br>
B.	69 days after manufacture (--).<br>
Monomer -1 Trial Results (Contd.):<br>
[0098] A dispersion of Monomer-I in the PET matrix was measured using standard<br>
SEM technique used for evaluating the dispersion of nylon in PET. A comparison of dispersion<br>
for the Monpmer-I / PET blend compared to MXD6 nylon / PET blend, each at 3% nominal<br>
loading, is shown in Figure 1. It appears that there is significant compatibilization between PET<br>
and monomer matrix compared to that of the MXD6 blend. Percent haze was measured using<br>
the hazemeter and the values for Monomer-I blend bottle compared to that of a plain PET bottle.<br><br><br>
[0099] Tyrcal haze levels for a 3% Monoxbar formulation would be &gt; 15%. It is<br>
obvious that there has been significant improvement in the haze level using the Monomer -I as<br>
the barrier material. The blend formulation is not perceptibly different in transparency compared<br>
to plain PET container.<br><br>
Monomer - II Trial Results:<br>
[0100] Preforms were molded using Monomer - II material at 3% let down on the<br>
Husky molding machine and 16 oz bottles were blown using RHBL. Two sets of bottles were<br>
mounted on an oxygen permeation measuring device - similar to MoCon Oxtran analyzer- after<br>
being stored empty at STP conditions. The first set (C) were mounted 3 days after manufacture,<br>
and the second set (D) were mounted 47 days after manufacture. Results are shown in Figure 5.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0101] Preforms were made on Husky LX 160 PET, 2 cavity machine using the<br>
following formulation: Vitiva™ PET + 3% N,N' Bis (phenylmethyl) hexane diamide (Monomer-<br>
I) + 75 ppm Co. Vitiva PET and Monomer-I powder were tumble blended in a bucket and fed<br>
into the machine hopper. Cobalt-NDA dispersed in a liquid hydrocarbon carrier, was introduced<br>
using a ColorMatrix brand positive displacement pump. Actual final composition in the preform<br>
was verified by performing Nitrogen and ICP analysis Bottles were blown on a unit cavity 16<br>
oz blow mold using a Sidel SBO-1 machine . Bottles were blown and were mounted on an<br>
oxygen permeation measuring device - similar to MoCon Oxtran analyzer-13 days after<br>
manufacture.<br>
Trial Results:<br>
[0102] The graph in Figure 6 shows the OTR performance.<br><br>
[0103] As can be seen from the graph in Figure 6, some scavenging is evidenced. In<br>
order to determine the scavenging potential, samples from the side wall of the container were<br>
sealed into a 20 mL vial and decrease in oxygen % over time was measured using oxy-sense. The<br>
graph in Figure 7 shows the decrease in oxygen concentration over time for a 3% Monomer-I<br>
blend compared to a typical Monoxbar™ MXDe-Co++-PET blend composition used by Constar<br>
in packaging applications.<br>
Trial Results:<br>
[0104] Monomer-I content was measured by performing a nitrogen analysis (Leco<br>
method) while the cobalt content was determined using inductively coupled plasma emission<br>
spectroscopy (ICPES) analysis. The results are as follows:<br>
Diamide content: 2.6 - 2.7%<br>
Co content: 63 - 71 ppm<br>
[0105] Decrease in oxygen concentration observed using the vial test provides evidence<br>
for the scavenging ability / potential of Monomer-I in a monolayer blend construction with PET<br>
as the base resin. It also suggests possible influences of processing conditions on scavenging.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0106] Further tests were performed to evaluate thermal effect in manufacturing<br>
preforms on an Arburg machine (different platform) to look at the effect of processing on<br>
scavenging. Differences between Husky and Arburg injection machines used for the trials are<br>
summarized below:<br><br>
Trial results:<br>
[0107] Preforms were manufactured using the 20 oz 38 g preform tooling on a single<br>
cavity, 70 ton Arburg injection machine. Preforms were made by tumbling PET pellets,<br>
Monomer-I powder and Cobalt carboxylate powder. The following formulations were used:<br><br>
1.	PET+ 3% Monomer-I + 75 ppm Co<br>
2.	PET+ 5% Monomer-I + 75 ppm Co<br>
[0108] Preforms were converted into 16 and 20 oz hot-fill containers and were<br>
mounted on an oxygen permeation measuring device - similar to MoCon Oxtran analyzer-10<br>
days later after being stored empty at STP conditions. Results are shown in the graphs in Figure<br>
8.<br>
[0109] The clarity of the bottles produced are excellent with measured OTR results<br>
being as much as an order of magnitude better than the former examples, and the induction<br>
period is not evident.<br>
[0110] Monomer-I content was measured by performing a nitrogen analysis (Leco<br>
method) while the cobalt content was determined using ICPES analysis for bottles tested on the<br>
oxygen permeation apparatus. The results are as follows:<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Trial results:<br>
[0111] A validation trial was performed by manufacturing preforms with 4% monomer-<br>
1 content. As previously done, preforms were manufactured using the 20 oz 38 g preform tooling<br>
on a single cavity, 70 ton Arburg injection machine. Preforms were made by tumbling PET<br>
pellets, monomer-1 powder and Cobalt carboxylate powder. The following formulation was<br>
used: PET+ 4% Monomer-I + 75 ppm Co.<br>
[0112] 20 oz bottles were blown from preforms and stored empty at STP conditions<br>
prior to testing. Bottles were blown and were mounted on an oxygen permeation measuring<br>
device - similar to MoCon Oxtran analyzer 25 days later. Results are shown in Figure 9.<br>
[0113] It is evident from the above examples that processing during injection molding<br>
(extruder sizing, residence time, screw type, injection set-up etc.) have a strong influence on<br>
oxygen scavenging performance. In order to understand the effect of residence time on the<br>
Monomer-I decomposition in the extruder, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed.<br><br>
A known sample weignt was placed the pan and the sample heated at a known rate of 10 Deg<br>
C/min. and the weight loss that occurs was recorded. This experiment was performed both in<br>
nitrogen and air atmosphere. The resultant scans are shown in Figure 10.<br>
[0114] It is clear that the Monomer-I material would undergo some thermal<br>
decomposition in the extruder conditions typically used for the manufacture of PET preforms. In<br>
order to understand this further, a known weight sample of Monomer-I was placed in the sample<br>
pan and the sample quickly heated (40 °C/min heating rate was used) to 280 °C. The sample<br>
temperature was maintained at 280 °C for a period of 300 seconds (to simulate typical residence<br>
time in the extruder) and the resulting TGA scan was recorded. The scan is reproduced in Figure<br>
11.<br>
[0115] Results obtained from thermo gravimetric analyzer shown in the above<br>
examples, seem to suggest that the residence time would negatively influence the oxygen<br>
scavenging performance due to the Monomer-I partly undergoing thermal decomposition. This<br>
correlates well with the scavenging performance seen with Husky and Arburg injection<br>
platforms.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0116] A design of experiment (DOE) trial was performed on a production injection<br>
machine to evaluate the effect of monomer-1 content and process conditions on bottle<br>
performance particularly oxygen scavenging. A 9 run factorial experiment was performed with 4<br>
factors - monomer-1 content, cobalt content, extruder temperature and cycle time. Previous work<br>
had shown that the material is sensitive to extruder temperature and residence time and the DOE<br>
was planned to study the effect of processing parameters as well as any interaction effect<br>
between the different factors.<br>
Test Plan- Experiment #1<br>
[0117] Preforms were made on Husky XL 300 PET machine equipped with a 48 cavity<br>
38 g preform mold. The monomer-1 material was pre-blended with Cobalt NDA at desired let-<br>
downs and was fed using a suitable powder feeder (K-tron feeder). The DOE matrix is shown in<br>
the table below. The responses measured were oxygen transmission rate (Illiop), % oxygen<br>
remaining (oxy-sense), IV, and crystallization characteristics (onset).<br><br><br><br>
[0118] The results were analyzed using a statistical program (Stat-Ease). Figure 12<br>
shows the % oxygen remaining after Day 1 using oxy-sense (scavenging speed). Analysis shows<br>
that increasing the diamide content results in less oxygen remaining in the vial (more<br>
scavenging). Interestingly, increasing the cobalt content results in slight increase in oxygen<br>
remaining in the vial (Figure 13). This might indicate presence of an optimum cobalt level<br>
between 50 and 150 ppm for best scavenging.<br>
[0119] Figures 14 and 15 below show the effect of diamide content and extruder<br>
temperatures on the amount of oxygen remaining in the vial after 7 days (scavenging capacity).<br>
Increasing the diamide content results in higher scavenging capacity. Interestingly, higher<br>
extruder temperatures show a slight reduction in % oxygen remaining in the vial. This could<br>
potentially be due to some of the diamide material being already reacted in the extruder and<br>
resulting in less material available for scavenging after bottle manufacture.<br>
[0120] Bottles were also mounted on Illiop to get actual oxygen transmission rate<br>
(mL/pkg/day) measurements and were input into the DOE software for analysis. There were<br>
interaction effects between diamide content, extruder temperatures and injection cycle time.<br>
Interaction effect plots are shown in Figures 16 and 17.<br>
[0121] It can be seen that both increasing the extruder temperature and cycle time<br>
(residence time) result in higher OTR (less effective scavenging). Again this seems to indicate<br>
that part of the material is already reacted in the extruder and less is actually available for<br>
scavenging after the bottle manufacture.<br>
[0122] In order to understand the oxygen scavenging performance over a long time,<br>
bottles from Run #8 (2.25%) and Run #9 (3.0%) were mounted on the Uliop at regular time<br>
intervals and the oxygen scavenging performance monitored (Figure 18).<br><br>
[0123] In order to understand the effect of PET type (PET-1 is PET type 1, PET-2 is<br>
PET type 2, and PET-3 is PET type 3) on scavenging, bottles were made with following<br>
formulations:<br>
PET-1 + 2.5 % monomer-1 + 75 ppm Co @ 270 Deg C extruder temperature<br>
PET-1 + 2.5% monomer-1 + 75 ppm Co @ 290 Deg C extruder temperature<br>
PET-2 + 2.5 % monomer-1 + 75 ppm Co @ 280 Deg C extruder temperature<br>
PET-3 + 2.5% monomer-1 + 75 ppm Co @ 280 Deg C extruder temperature<br>
PET-1: High CHDM co-polymer resin with UVI / little re-heat additives<br>
PET-2: IPA modified co-polymer no UVI / re-heat additives<br>
PET-3: CHDM modified co-polymer with high amounts of re-heat additive<br>
[0124] Samples were cut from the side-wall of the bottle and sealed in 20 mL vials and<br>
the scavenging performance was tested using oxy-sense (Figure 19). It is clear that proper<br>
selection of PET is important in achieving the optimum oxygen scavenging performance. PET-1<br>
seems to be the preferred PET of choice for optimized performance for a given formulation.<br>
