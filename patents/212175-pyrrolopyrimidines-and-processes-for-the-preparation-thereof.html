				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A novel method for increasing the supply ranges of packet oriented transferring radio stations which are located outside the range of a central base station and are supplied by wireless base stations (relay stations). In contrast to conventional wireless transfer systems, a communication service quality is guaranteed. The invention uses a common time-interconnected capacity assignment method. Said capacity assignment is generated by an AP for stations (MT, FMT) which can be reached directly by a base station (AP). Individual MTs are present in the form of wireless base stations and serve as relay stations (FMTs) with regard to the MTs outside the range of an AP. For an AP, FMTs appear as MTs. The FMT forms a partial frame structure in a part of the AP distribution capacity transfer system which is embedded in the time frame structure dictated by the commanding central station.</td>

Salts of compounds of formula I are especially acid addition salts with organic or inorganic acids, especially the pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic salts. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, carbonic acid (preferably in the form of the carbonates or hydrogen carbonates); hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid; sulfuric acid; or phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, carboxylic, phosphonic, sulfonic or sulfamic acids, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, gluconic acid, glucosemonocarboxylic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, glucaric acid, galactaric acid, amino acids, such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-methylglycine, acetylaminoacetic acid, N-acetylasparagine or N-acetyl-cystine, pyruvic acid, acetoacetic acid, phosphoserine. 2- or 3-glycerophosphoric acid, glucose-6-phosphoric acid, glucose-1-phosphoric acid, fructose-1,6-bis-phosphoric acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, methylmaleic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, adamant-anecarboxylic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 1- or 3-hydroxynaphthyl-2-carboxylic acid, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, 4-aminosali-cylic acid, phthalic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, cinnamic acid, nicotinic acid, iso-nicotinic acid, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, methane- or ethane-sulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, ethane-1.2-disulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthal-enesulfonic acid, 1,5-naphthalene-disulfonic acid, 2-, 3- or 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, methylsulfuric acid, ethylsulfuric acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, N-cyclohexylsulfamic acid, N-methyl-, N-ethyl- or N-propyl-sulfamic acid, or other organic protonic acids, such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula I having at least one free carboxy group are capable of forming internal salts or metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, or ammonium salts with ammonia or suitable organic amines, such as tertiary monoamines, for example triethylamine or tri(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or heterocyclic bases, for example N-ethyl-pipehdine or N.N'-dimethyl-piperazine.<br><br>
For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates. Only salts that are pharmaceutically acceptable and non-toxic (at the appropriate dosages) are used therapeutically and those salts are therefore preferred.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, hereinbefore and hereinafter any reference to the free compounds is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding salts, as appropriate and expedient.<br>
The compounds of formula I have valuable pharmacologically useful properties. In particular they exhibit specific inhibitory activities that are of pharmacological interest. They are effective especially as tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors and/or (furthermore) as inhibitors of serine/threonine protein kinases; they exhibit, for example, powerful inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and of c-erbB2 kinase. Those receptor-specific enzyme activities play a key role in signal transmission in a large number of mammalian cells, including human cells, especially epithelial cells, cells of the immune system and ceils of the central and peripheral nervous system. For example, in various cell types, EGF-induced activation of receptor-associated tyrosine protein kinase (EGF-R-TPK) is a prerequisite for cell division and hence for the proliferation of the cell population. An increase in the number of EGF-receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors thus inhibits the proliferation of the cells. The same applies analogously to the other protein kinases mentioned hereinbefore and hereinafter.<br>
In addition to or instead of inhibiting EGF-receptor tyrosine protein kinase, the compounds of formula I also inhibit to varying extents other tyrosine protein kinases that are involved in signal transmission mediated by trophic factors, for example abl kinase, especially v-abi kinase, kinases from the family of the src kinases, especially c-src kinase, Ick, fyn; other kinases of the EGF family, for example c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), c-erbB3 kinase, c-erbB4 kinase; members of the family of the PDGF-receptor tyrosine protein kinases, for example PDGF-receptor kinase. CSF-1 receptor kinase, Kit-receptor kinase, VEGF-receptor kinase (e.g. KDR and Flt-1) and FGF-receptor kinase; the receptor kinase of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 kinase),<br><br>
and serine/threonine kinases, for example protein kinase C or cdc kinases, all of which play a part in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.<br>
The inhibition of EGF-receptor-specific tyrosine protein kinase (EGF-R-TPK) can be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant intracellular domain of the EGF-receptor (EGF-R ICD; see, for example, E. McGlynn et al, Europ. J. Biochem. 20Z. 265-275 (1992)). Compared with the control without inhibitor, the compounds of formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50 % (IC50). for example in a concentration of from 0.0005 to 1 µM, especially from 0.001 to 0.1 µM.<br>
The action of the compounds of formula I on EGF-stimulated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in the EGF-receptor can be determined in the human A431 epithelial carcinoma cell line by means of an ELISA which is described in U. Trinks et aL, J, Med. Chem. 3Z;7,1015-1027 (1994). In that test (EGFR-EUSA) the compounds of formula I exhibit an IC50 of approximately from 0.001 to 1 µM.<br>
Stimulation of quiescent BALB/c3T3 cells with EGF rapidly induces the expression of c-fos mRNA. Pretreatment of the cells with a compound of formula I before the stimulation with EGF inhibits c-fos expression at an IC50 of approximately from 0.001 to 0.1 |j.M. That test procedure is likewise described in U. Trinks et ai, J, Med. Chem, 37:7. 1015-1027(1994).<br>
In the micromolar range too, the compounds of formula I exhibit, for example, inhibition of the cell growth of EGF-dependent cell lines, for example the epidermoid BALB/c mouse keratinocyte cell line (see Weissmann, B.A., and Aaronson, S.A., Cell 32, 599 (1983)) or the A431 cell line, which are recognised useful standard sources of EGF-dependent epithelial cells (see Carpenter, G., and Zendegni, J. Anal. Biochem. 153, 279-282 (1985)). In a known test method (see Meyer et a/.. Int. J. Cancer 43, 851 (1989)), the inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BALB/MK cells (10 000/microtitre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. The test compounds (dissolved in DMSO) are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1 % (v/v). After the addition, the plates are<br><br>
incubated for three days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to	j<br>
undergo at least three cell-division cycles. The growth of the MK cells is measured by<br>
means of methylene blue staining: after the incubation the cells are fixed with<br>
glutaraldehyde, washed with water and stained with 0.05 % methylene blue. After a<br>
washing step the stain is eluted with 3 % HCI and the optical density per well of the<br>
microtitre plate is measured using a Titertek Multiskan at 665 nm. IC50 values are<br>
determined by a computer-aided system using the formula:<br><br>
The IC50 value in those experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in question that results in a cell count that is 50 % lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity in the micromolar range, for example an IC50 of approximately from 0.1 to 1 |xM.<br>
The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibition of the growth of tumour cells also in vivo, as shown, for example, by the test described below; the test is based on inhibition of the growth of the human epidermoid carcinoma A431 (ATCC No. CRL 1555; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, USA; see Santon, J.B., ef a/.. Cancer Research 46, 4701-4705 (1986) and Ozawa, S., ef a/.. Int. J. Cancer 40, 706-710 (1987)), which is transplanted into female BALB/c nude mice (Bomholtgard, Denmark). That carcinoma exhibits a growth that correlates with the extent of the expression of the EGF-receptor. In the experiment, tumours having a volume of approximately 1 cm^ cultured in vivo are surgically removed from experimental animals under sterile conditions. The tumours are comminuted and suspended in 10 volumes (w/v) of phosphate-buffered saline. The suspension is injected s.c. (0.2 ml/mouse in phosphate-buffered saline) into the left flank of the animals. Alternatively, 1x106 cells from an in vitro culture in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline can be injected. Treatment with test compounds of formula I is started 5 or 7 days after the transplant, when the tumours have reached a diameter of 4-5 mm. The test compound in question is administered (in different doses for different animal groups) once a day for 15 successive days. The tumour growth is determined by measuring the diameter of the tumours along three axes that are perpendicular to each other. The tumour volumes are<br><br>
466-8 (1982)). The results are given as treatment/control percentages (T/C x 100 = T/C %). At a dose of from 3 to 50 mg/kg of active ingredient, distinct inhibition of the tumour growth is found, for example T/C % values of less than 10, which indicates strong inhibition of tumour growth.<br>
As well as or instead of inhibiting EGF-receptor tyrosine protein kinase, the compounds of formula I also inhibit other tyrosine protein kinases that are involved in signal transmission mediated by trophic factors, for example abl kinase, such as especially v-abi kinase (IC50 for example from 0.01 to 5 µM), kinases from the family of the src kinases, such as especially c-src kinase (IC50 for example from 0.1 to 10 |iM) and c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), and serine/-threonine kinases, for example protein kinase C, all of which are involved in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.<br>
The above-mentioned inhibition of v-abl tyrosine kinase is determined by the methods of N. Lydon era/.. Oncogene Research 5,161-173 (1990) and J. F. Geissler ef a/,. Cancer Research 52, 4492-4498 (1992). In those methods [Val5]-angiotensin II and [y -32P]-ATP are used as substrates.<br>
The inhibition of c-erbB2 tyrosine kinase (HER-2) can be determined, for example, analogously to the method used for EGF-R-TPK (see C. House et aL, Europ, J. Biochem. 140, 363-367 (1984)). The c-erbB2 kinase can be isolated, and its activity determined, by means of protocols known perse, for example in accordance with T. Akiyama et ai, Science 232, 1644(1986).<br>
The compounds of formula I which inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) or of the other tyrosine protein kinases mentioned are therefore useful, for example, in the treatment of benign or malignant tumours. They are capable of effecting tumour regression and of preventing the formation of tumour metastases and the growth of micrometastases. They can be used especially in the case of epidermal hyperproliferation (psoriasis), in the treatment of neoplasias of epithelial character, e.g. mammary carcinomas, and in leukaemias. In addition, the compounds of formula I (especially the novel compounds) can be used in the treatment of those disorders of the immune system in which several or, especially, individual tyrosine protein kinases and/or<br><br>
(furthermore) serine/threonine protetin kinases are involved; those connpounds of formula I can also be used in the treatment of those disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system in which signal transmission by several or, especially, a single tyrosine protein kinase(s) and/or (furthermore) serine/threonine protein kinase(s) is/are involved.<br>
In general, the present invention relates also to the use of the compounds of formula I in the inhibition of the mentioned protein kinases.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used both alone and in combination with other pharmacologically active compounds, for example together with inhibitors of the enzymes of polyamine synthesis, inhibitors of protein kinase C, inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases, cytokines, negative growth regulators, for example TGF-3 or IFN-R, aromatase inhibitors, antioestrogens and/or cytostatic drugs.<br>
In the preferred subjects of the invention mentioned hereinafter, general definitions can be replaced by the more specific definitions given at the beginning, where appropriate and expedient.<br>

Detailed description of the process steps<br>
The above processes are described in detail below (see also German Offenlegungs-schrift No. 30 36 390, published on 13th May 1982, and A, Jorgensen etaL, J. Heterocyd. Chem. 22, 859 [1985]). In the more precise description that follows, unless othenA/ise indicated the radicals R, R1  and Rg and n are as defined for compounds of formula I.<br>
General points:<br>
The end products of formula I may contain substituents that can also be used as protecting groups in starting materials for the preparation of other end products of formula I. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term -protecting group- is used in this text to denote only a readily removable group that is not a constituent of the particular desired end product of formula L<br>
Process a)<br><br>
In the compound of formula II a suitable leaving group X is preferably halogen, such as bromine, iodine or especially chlorine. 1-AryMower alkyl Z is preferably 1-phenyl-lower alkyl, such as especially 1-phenylethyl or, more especially, benzyl.<br>
Free functional groups present in the radicals R1  and R2, which are if necessary protected by readily removable protecting groups, are especially amino or lower alkylamino.<br>
Protecting groups and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in -Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry-, Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, and in -Methoden der organischen Chemie-, Houben-Weyl, 4th edition. Vol, 15/1, Georg-Thieme-Verlag. Stuttgart 1974 and in Theodora W. Greene, -Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis-, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1981. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they can be removed readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions taking place, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also under physiological conditions.<br>
A protected amino group may be present, for example, in the form of a readily cleavable acylamino, arylmethylamino, etherified mercaptoamino or 2-acyl-lower alk-1-enyl-amino group.<br>
In such an acylamino group, acyl is, for example, the acyl radical of an organic carboxylic acid having, for example, up to 18 carbon atoms, especially an unsub-stituted or substituted, for example halo- or aryl-substituted, alkanecarboxylic acid or an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoic acid, or of a carbonic acid semiester. Such acyl groups are, for example, lower alkanoyl, such as formyl, acetyl or propionyl, halo-lower alkanoyl, such as 2-haloacetyl, especially 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2,2,2-tri-fluoro- or 2,2,2-trichloro-acetyl, unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoyl, for example benzoyl, 4-chlorobenzoyl. 4-methoxybenzoyl or 4-nitrobenzoyl, or lower alkoxycarbonyl that is branched in the Imposition of the lower alkyl radical or suitably substituted in the 1- or 2-position, especially tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert-butoxycarbonyl, arylmethoxycarbonyl having one or two aryl radicals which are preferably phenyl<br><br>
that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted, for example, by lower aikyi, especially tert-lower alkyl, such as tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, hydroxy, halogen, for example chlorine, and/or by nitro, such as unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, for example 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, for example benzhydryloxycarbonyl or di(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxycarbonyl, aroylmethoxycarbonyl wherein the aroyi group is preferably benzoyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, such as bromine, for example phenacyloxycarbonyl, 2-halo-lower alkoxy carbonyl, for example 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2-bromoethoxycarbonyl or 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl, or 2-(tri-substituted silyl)-ethoxycarbonyl wherein the substituents are each independently of the others an unsubstituted or substituted, for example lower alkyl-, lower alkoxy-, aryl-, halo- or nitro-substituted, aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having up to 15 carbon atoms, such as corresponding, unsubstituted or substituted lower alkyl, phenyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyi or phenyl, for example 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-ethoxycarbonyl, such as 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl or 2-(di-n-butyl-methyl-silyl)-ethoxycarbonyl, or 2-triarylsilylethoxycarbonyl, such as 2-triphenylsilylethoxycarbonyl.<br>
In an arylmethylamino group, which is a mono-, di- or especfally tri-arylmethyl-amino group, the aryl radicals are especially unsubstituted or substituted phenyl radicals. Such groups are, for example, benzyl-, diphenylmethyl- and especially trityl-amino.<br>
An etherified mercapto group in an amino group protected by such a radical is especially arylthio or aryl-lower alkylthio, wherein aryl is, especially, phenyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro. A corresponding amino-protecting group is, for example, 4-nitrophenylthio,<br>
In a 2-acyl-lower alk-1-en-l-yl radical that can be used as an amino-protecting group, acyl is, for example, the corresponding radical of a lower alkanecarboxylic acid, of a benzoic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such<br><br>
as chlorine, and/or by nitro. or especially of a carbonic acid semiester, such as a carbonic acid lower alky! semiester. Corresponding protecting groups are especially 1-lower alkanoyl-prop-1-en-2-yl, such as 1-acetyl-prop-1-en-2-yl, or 1-lower alkoxycarbonyl-prop-1-en-2-yi, for example 1-ethoxycarbonyl-prop-1-en-2-yl.<br>
Preferred amino-protecting groups are acyl radicals of carbonic acid semiesters, especially tert-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example as indicated, for example 4-nitro-benzyloxycarbonyl, or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, or 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, also trityl or formyl.<br>
The reaction between the derivative of formula II and the amine of formula 111 takes place in suitable inert polar solvents, especially alcohols, for example lower alkanols, such as methanol, propanol, isopropanol or especially ethanol or n-butanol. In some cases the addition of a solubiliser, such as 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), is advantageous. The reaction takes place at elevated temperatures, for example in a temperature range of from 70 to 150°C, preferably under reflux conditions.<br>
If Z in the compound of formula II is 1-aryl-lower alkyl, that radical is removed from the resulting precursor of the compound of formula I (with Z instead of the hydrogen atom at the nitrogen). That is effected, for example, by treatment with protonic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acids or polyphosphoric acid, at preferred temperatures of from 20°C to 150°C and where appropriate in the presence of water (that is<br>
especially the preferred method for Z = 1-phenylethyl); or preferably by treatment with Lewis acids, especially AICI3, in an aromatic solvent, especially in benzene and/or toluene, at elevated temperature, especially under reflux [that is especially the preferred variant for Z = benzyl; see also the analogous process in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 39(5), 1152(1991)].<br>
The removal of the protecting groups that are not constituents of the desired end product of formula I is effected in a manner known perse, for example by means of<br><br>
solvolysis, especially hydrolysis, alcoholysis or acidolysis, or by means of reduction, especially hydrogenolysis or chemical reduction, where appropriate step-wise or simultaneously.<br>
A protected amino group is freed in a manner known perse and, according to the nature of the protecting groups, in various ways, preferably by solvolysis or reduction. 2-Halo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino (where appropriate after conversion of a 2-bromo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group into a 2-iodo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group), aroylmethoxycarbonylamino or 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with a suitable chemical reducing agent, such as zinc in the presence of a suitable carboxylic acid, such as aqueous acetic acid. Aroylmethoxycarbonylamino can be cleaved also by treatment with a nucleophilic, preferably salt-forming, reagent, such as sodium thiophenolate, and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino also by treatment with an alkali metal dithionite, for example sodium dithionite. Unsubstituted or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonylamino, tert-lower alkoxycarbonylamino or 2-trisubstituted silylethoxycarbonylamino can be cleaved by treatment with a suitable acid, for example formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid; unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by means of hydrogenolysis, i.e. by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst; unsubstituted or substituted triarylmethylamino or formylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as a mineral acid, for example hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, for example formic, acetic or trifluoroacetic acid, where appropriate in the presence of water; and an amino group protected by an organic silyl group can be freed, for example, by means of hydrolysis or alcoholysis. An amino group protected by 2-haloacetyl, for example 2-chloroacetyl, can be freed by treatment with thiourea in the presence of a base, or with a thiolate salt, such as an alkali metal thiolate, of thiourea, and subsequent solvolysis, such as alcoholysis or hydrolysis, of the resulting condensation product. An amino group protected by 2-substituted silylethoxycarbonyl can be converted into the free amino group also by treatment with a salt of hydrofluoric acid that yields fluoride anions.<br><br>

Starting materials:<br>
The starting materials of formula II are novel and the present invention relates also thereto. They can be prepared by processes analogous to those described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 28 18 676 (published 8th Nov, 1979) and German Offen-legungsschrift No. 30 36 390 (published on 13th May 1982).<br>
The starting material of formula II wherein X is chlorine is obtained, for example, from a compound analogous to formula II wherein X is hydroxy by reaction with phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride, P(=0)Cl3) with the exclusion of moisture at the reflux temperature. If desired, the further reaction of the starting material of formula II thus obtained wherein X is chlorine can be carried out with an amine of formula III in the same vessel, i.e. as a one-pot reaction. For that purpose, once the reaction with phosphorus oxychloride is complete, the reaction mixture from that reaction is<br><br>
concentrated to dryness by evaporation, made into a suspension with a suitable solvent, such as n-butanol, and reacted further with the amine of formula III.<br>
A compound analogous to formula II wherein X is hydroxy is obtained, for example, from a compound of formula V<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, by reaction with formic acid which is preferably used in excess relative to the compound of formula V, for example in a 10 to 30 molar excess, where appropriate in the presence of inert solvents, such as dimethylformamide, at elevated temperature, for example at temperatures of from 80°C to the boiling temperature.<br>
Alternatively, a compound analogous to formula II wherein X is hydroxy and the remaining symbols are as defined above is obtained, for example, from a compound of formula VI<br><br>
wherein R4 is lower alkyl, such as especially ethyl, and the remaining symbols are as defined above, by reaction with a large excess of formamide in a mixture of anhydrous dimethylformamide and formic acid. The reaction is carried out at elevated temperature, for example at from 100°C to 150°C, and preferably under a protecting gas.<br><br>
The present invention relates also to the novel starting materials of formulae V and VI.<br>
The 1-(Z')-2-amino-3-cyano-pyrroles of formula V used as intermediates can be prepared in good yields by methods that are known perse and have been published [see, for example, Roth, H.J., and Eger, K., Arch. Pharmaz. 308, 179 (1975)]. For that purpose, for example, a compound of formula VII<br><br>
which is then converted with malonic acid dinitrile of the formula CH2(CN)2 into the desired intermediate of formula V. In detail, the reaction with the amine Z'-'NH2 is carried out under customary condensation conditions, for example in the presence of catalytic amounts of a strong acid, for example hydrochloric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, at elevated temperature (preferably at the boiling temperature) in a suitable solvent, for example benzene or toluene, with the removal of water, to form the respective a-amino ketone of formula VIIL The latter is not isolated but is immediately<br>
condensed with malonic acid dinitrile with heating and with further removal of water, if necessary with the addition of a small amount of a base, such as piperidine, a compound of formula V being obtained.<br>
The compounds of formula VI wherein R2 is N-benzyl-pyridinium-2-yl and the remaining symbols are as defined above that are used as intermediates are obtained, for example, by reacting a compound of formula VI wherein R2 is hydrogen and the remaining symbols are<br><br>
as defined above with N-ben2yl-2-bromo-pyridinium bromide in a suitable solvent, such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as especially methylene chloride. The reaction is preferably carried out under a protective gas, in the dark and under anhydrous conditions at room temperature or elevated temperature, for example at from 20°C to SOX, and in the presence of 2,6-dimethyl-pyridine (2,6-lutidine), The remaining compounds of formula VI are obtained, for example, by reacting a 2-amidino-acetic acid lower alkyl ester of formula IX<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above. The leaving group X is preferably bromine. The 2-amidino-acetic acid lower alkyl ester of formula IX is freed from its acid addition salt, such as especially its hydrochloride, before the start of the reaction with the aid of equinormal amounts of a base, such as especially sodium ethanolate, with ice-cooling. The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, such as especially a lower alkanol, such as preferably ethanol, at preferred temperatures of from 0°C to 50°C, especially at room temperature.<br>

For parenteral administration there are especially suitable aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example in the form of a water-soluble salt, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and. if desired, stabilisers. The active ingredient, optionally together with excipients, can also be in the form of a lyophilisate and can be made into a solution prior to parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.<br>
Solutions such as are used, for example, for parenteral administration can also be employed as infusion solutions.<br>
Preferred preservatives are, for example, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or microbicides, such as sorbic acid or benzoic acid.<br>
Ointments are oil-in-water emulsions that contain up to 70 %, but preferably from 20 % to 50 %, water or aqueous phase. Suitable as fatty phase are especially hydrocarbons, for example petroleum jelly, paraffin oil or hard paraffins, which, in order to improve the water-binding capacity, preferably contain suitable hydroxy compounds, such as fatty alcohols or esters thereof, for example cetyl alcohol or wool wax alcohols, such as wool wax.<br><br>
Emulsifiers are corresponding lipophilic substances, such as sorbitan fatty acid esters (Spans), for example sorbitan oleate and/or sorbitan isostearate. Additives to the aqueous phase are, for example, humectants, such as polyalcohols, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and/or polyethylene glycol, and also preservatives and perfumes.<br>
Fatty ointments are anhydrous and contain as base especially hydrocarbons, for example paraffin, petroleum jelly or paraffin oil, also natural or partially synthetic fats, for example coconut fatty acid triglyceride, or preferably hardened oils, for example hydrogenated groundnut oil or castor oil, also fatty acid partial esters of glycerol, for example glycerol mono- and/or di-stearate, and also, for example, the fatty alcohols increasing the water-absorption, emulsifiers and/or additives mentioned in connection with the ointments.<br>
Creams are oil-in-water emulsions that contain more than 50 % water. As oily base there are used especially fatty alcohols, for example lauryl, cetyl or stearyl alcohol, fatty acids, for example palmitic or stearic acid, liquid to solid waxes, for example isopropyl myristate, wool wax or beeswax, and/or hydrocarbons, for example petroleum jelly (petrolatum) or paraffin oil. Suitable emulsifiers are surface-active substances having predominantly hydrophilic properties, such as corresponding non-ionic emulsifiers, for example fatty acid esters of polyalcohols or ethylene oxide adducts thereof, such as polyglycerol fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (Tweens), and also polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers or fatty acid esters, or corresponding ionic emulsifiers, such as alkali metal salts of fatty alcohol sulfates, for example sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium cetyl sulfate or sodium stearyl sulfate, which are usually used in the presence of fatty alcohols, for example cetyl alcohol or stearyl alcohol. Additives to the aqueous phase are, inter alia, agents that reduce the drying out of the creams, for example polyalcohols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol and/or polyethylene glycols, and also preservatives and perfumes.<br>
Pastes are creams and ointments having secretion-absorbing powder constituents, such as metal oxides, for example titanium oxide or zinc oxide, also talcum and/or aluminium silicates, the purpose of which is to bind any moisture or secretions present.<br>
Foams are administered from pressurised containers and are liquid oil-in-water emulsions in aerosol form; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorofluoro-lower alkanes, for example dichlorodifluoromethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or preferably non-halogenated<br><br>
gaseous hydrocarbons, air, N2O or carbon dioxide, are used as propellant gases. As oil phase there are used, inter alia, those used above in the case of ointments and creams; the additives mentioned in that connection are also used.<br>
Tinctures and solutions generally have an aqueous-ethanolic base to which there are added, inter aiia, polyalcohols, for example glycerol, glycols and/or polyethylene glycol, as humectants for reducing evaporation, and fat-restoring substances, such as fatty acid esters with low molecular weight polyethylene glycols, that is to say lipophilic substances that are soluble in the aqueous mixture, as a replacement for the fatty substances removed from the skin by the ethanol, and, if necessary, other adjuncts and additives.<br>
The invention relates also to a process or a method of treating the above-mentioned pathological conditions, especially those conditions responsive to the inhibition of protein kinases. The compounds of formula I can be administered as such or in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactically or therapeutically, preferably in an amount effective against the said diseases, to a warm-blooded animal, for example a human, requiring such treatment, the compounds especially being used in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.
