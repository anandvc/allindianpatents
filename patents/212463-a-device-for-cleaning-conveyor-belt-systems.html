This invention relates to a device for cleaning conveyor belt systems and is particularly useful in cleaning conveyor belts that handle bulk materials.<br>
Belt conveyors are used for transporting loose materials or articles over a distance between two points. Materials conveyed on the conveyor belting are usually bulk solidS, fine powders* wet sticky materials or slurries. These materials are loaded on to the conveyor belting at one point and are carried by the belt to be discharged into the discharge chute at the other point. However, in pract ice, not al1 the material being conveyed or carried are discharged fully into the discharge chute. It is observed that irrespective of the type or nature of the materials being transported, at least a portion of the material tends to stick to the surface of the belting and gets carried back by the conveyor on its return run* These particles adhering to the belt tend to get detached therefrom during its return run and may get accumulated at various points below the belting. In the long run, the^e materials falling on the idler rollers tend to alter the shape of the idlers, resulting in jamming of the idler rollers. Metallic surfaces of the idler rollers may also be corroded and damaged. Conveyor belt and conveyor structure damage and huge wastage of material are the ultimate result which must be obviated by minimising the quantity of the bulk material carried back by the conveyor during its return run.<br>
An effective belt cleaning system is therefore essential to remove particles adhering to the belt during its return run. Cleaning devices currently in use are rubber strips, polyurethane<br><br>
blades, metallic wires and the like. These devices scrape the materials clean from the conveyor belting and are maintained in constant contact therewith. Counter-weights or springs arc used to ensure constant contact of these blades with the belt surface on its return side. These counter-weights or springs exert pressure on the blades to effect scraping action. In the absence of a better alternative, scraper type cleaning systems are currently accepted by the industry.<br>
Continuous use of this type of scraping device for cleaning damages the belts and clip or fastener joints that join the beltings. This is in addition to the natural wear and tear of the scraper itself. Open surfaces and damaged areas of the belting are more prone to the damaging action of the scrapers. Further, entangling of foreign and undesired material on to the scraper is also observed.<br>
In order to obviate the above mentioned drawbacks of these conventional cleaners and to improve the quality of cleaning substantiallly the present invention has been developed. One of the major advantages of the invented device is that cleaning may be effected without the system actually coming into contact with the surface of the belting, though cleaning by actual contact with the belt surface is also within the purview and scope of this device.<br>
The device according to this invention has a rotatable drum having a plurality of fins mounted therein. Each projecting fin has a U shaped recess on one side while the side opposite thereto<br><br>
is plain but is angularly disposed on the drum. In a preferred embodiment* these projecting fins may be disposed appropriately on the surface of a tubular disc and a plurality of such discs may be on the rotatable drum. The shaft for rotating the drum may be made of three component parts, viz. a central portion made of steel or the like rigid material capable of withstanding the tangential forces that arise while carrying out cleaning operations, stub shafts are provided on either end of the mainshaft and one such stub shaft is connected to a V belt pulley arrangement*<br>
Vacuum fin discs are made of high density polymers such as natural and synthetic rubber, polyurethane and nylons to provide strength, abrasion resistance and long life to the fins. Each disc has a plurality of such projecting fins and has means such as a recess for taking up torque transmitting steel rods* These discs are also provided with means such as holes for introducing stay rods to hold the desired number of discs together. Plurality of such discs are assembled on the cleaner shaft by means of keys, stay rods and torque transmitting plates to constitute the cleaner drum. The number of discs may vary depending upon the width of the conveyor belt to be cleaned.<br>
Drive system of the device consists of conventional prime mover such as an electric motor of the desired horse power connected by means of V belts and pulleys. The device is preferably mounted just below the belting to be cleaned at the discharge end of the conveyor. It is advantageous to position the device within the chute such that the dislodged material from<br><br>
the same is thrown into the chute. This effectively cleans the belt surface avoiding accumulation of material on the conveyor belt surface during repeated reruns.<br>
The device may also have an electronic drive protection means consisting of conventional timers, relays and overload protection means. This system is conected to the main motor that drives the conveyor belt and is timed such that the operation of the cleaner starts only after a predetermined time lag after the start of the conveyor belt motor through which the cleaner motor derives power*<br>
The device for cleaning conveyor belt systems according to this invention comprises a drivable cleaner drum having at least two projecting fins disposed thereon, each projecting fin having a U shaped recess on one side thereof, the other side being plain, the said projecting fins being angularly disposed on the periphery of the said drum such that the side with ihe U shaped recess of one fin faces the plain side of the fin disposed adjacent thereto, to create a vacuum when driven in a direction opposite to that of the conveyor belt, thereby dislodging adherent particles from the conveyor belt surface.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings*<br>
Fig.1 shows a sectional view of the conveyor system having the device according to this invention disposed within the chute. Conveyor  belt is indicated by reference letter B and  the  loose<br><br>
material  transported by the belt is marked M.   C indicates  the chute into which the material is transferred from the belt.  The arrow inside drum D on which the belt  is moved shows the direction of its movement. The device for cleaning the surface of  the belt is marked F while the projecting fins are  shown by the  letters PF,  This device is located just below the  conveyor belt without establishing actual contact therewith-  The smal 1 arrow shows  the direction of movement of the cleaning device. The port ion marked A in this figure is exploded and shown  in Fig.2.  Vacuum created between the U side of one fin and the straight side of the adjacent fin is shown by the dotted  lines. During the course of rotation when the fins move away from the belt,  positive pressure  is created on the moving fins which together with the  centrifugal  force acting on  the cleaned particles, fall inside the chute.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a plurality of projecting fins in the shape of a disc. U and S represent the U shaped recess and the oppositely disposed  straight side. Plurality of such discs may be mounted on a drivabie shaft which is connected to the motor through a time delay system which is conventional and known in the art. The discs may be mounted on the shafts and held in place with the help of stay rods for which holes are provided in the disc.<br>
Though this invention has been described hereinabove with a particular embodiment, obvious equivalents and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are not excluded from the scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
