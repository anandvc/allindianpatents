Hydrophobically Modified Polymers as Laundry Additives<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Various attempts have been made to overcome the problem of dye bleeding and/or dye transfer in laundry processes. The term "dye bleeding" often refers to the fact that certain dyes will come off the fabrics during laundering, thereby causing color fading of the fabrics. Such a phenomenon seems to be more prominent for cellulosic fabrics dyed with non-reactive dyes such as direct, vat, azoic and sulfur dyes (D R. Warring and G. Hallas, 'The chemistry and application of dyes", Plenum Press, New York, 1990). Dyes that come off the fabrics are often called "migrating dyes" and the process to overcome dye bleeding are often referred to as "dye fixation".<br>
On the other hand, there is also a need to take care of the migrating dyes that have already come off the fabrics and are present in the wash liquor. Otherwise, such migrating dyes might redeposit on fabric surfaces and thereby cause color contamination. This process is often referred to as "dye transfer inhibition" and/or "stain inhibition".<br>
Hence there is a need for additives that can be added into laundry detergents and/or after rinse products to help either prevent dyes on fabrics from bleeding, i.e. fixing, or substances that can prevent migrating dyes from re-deposition. Indeed much efforts have been made to overcome such problems, and substances that could help tackle such problems are often referred as dye fixatives, dye transfer inhibitors, anti-deposition agents, dye scavengers and/or staining inhibitors.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,694,364, there is disclosed the use of tertiary polymeric amines which function as anionic dye scavengers. The polymeric amines are chemically affixed on the surface of a substrate material such as cellulosic materials, for example, cotton in any of its forms, purified cotton cellulose, cellulose sponge and the like. To affix the polymeric amines, the cotton substrate is modified by phosphorylation and chemisorption of the polymeric amine. In related U.S. Patent No. 3,673,110, there is disclosed the use of both the tertiary polymeric amines and quaternary ammonium compounds as the dye scavenging material. The latter Edwards patent discloses other processes for chemically affixing the dye<br><br>
scavenger compounds to a cellulosic material substrate also for use in controlling undesirable random dyes in a liquid bath such as when laundering textile articles. For example, the hydroxylated surface of the cellulosic material is chemically modified to establish anionic functional groups. Each of the anionic functional groups is capable of chemically binding nitrogen compounds such as the aforementioned disclosed dye scavenger compounds.<br>
In addition to modifying the fabric surface to present dye transfer, it is also possible to add into the laundry sacrificial materials that absorb migrating dyes, thereby prevent the re-deposition on fabrics of value and concern. Such materials are often made in the form of fabrics treated with various chemicals that are believed to be capable to attracting dyes from the wash liquor. In Kleinschmidt, U.S. Patent No. 3,816,321 there is disclosed a dye scavenging article for scavenging anionic dyes released from dyed fabrics being laundered to prevent dye transfer during the laundry process. The dye-scavenging article includes a support matrix such as a polyurethane material to which there is chemically bonded a dye-scavenging compound. The dye-scavenging compound includes polyquaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,380,453 discloses generally the use of N-trisubstituted ammonium-2-hydroxy-3 -halopropyl compounds and salts of epoxy propyl ammonium as dye scavenger compounds. The preferred dye scavenger compound is glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride, which is applied to, adsorbed by, or impregnated in the cellulosic material substrate. The resulting cellulosic material substrate is disclosed as being suitable for use in conventional washing machines for laundering clothes to eliminate random dyes from the wash and rinse waters, thereby eliminating undesirable discoloration of clothes due to the transfer of dyes from other clothes in the washing machine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,698,476 discloses an article for removing extraneous, random free-flowing dyes from laundry washing applications. The laundry article includes two components, a dye absorber and a dye transfer inhibitor, which are introduced into the wash water via a support matrix. The dye absorber is chemically attached to the support matrix to maintain a relational association during the laundry washing application. On the other hand, the dye transfer inhibitor is released from the support matrix into the wash water to be evenly distributed during the laundry washing application.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,698,476 discloses materials that are suitable as dye absorbers for the laundry article, including quaternary N-substituted ammonium)-hydroxy-haloalkyl compounds such as 2-hydroxy-3-chloropropoyltrimethylammonium chloride; polyquaternary ammonium compounds; polyamphoterics; quatemized starches; proteins; chitin or its hydrolyzed form, chitosan; choline chloride; polyvinyl amine (PVAm); polyethylene imine (PEI); as well as combinations thereof. Dye transfer inhibitors include polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl imidazole, polyamine-N-oxides, cationic starches, magnesium aluminate, hydrotalcite, proteins, hydrolyzed proteins, polyethylene imines, polyvinyl oxazolidone, enzymes, oxidants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, propylene oxide reaction products, polyamino acids, block co-polymers of alkylene oxides, polyamines, polyamides, methyl cellulose, carboxyalkyl, celluloses, guar gum, natural gums, alginic acid, polycarboxylic acids, cyclodextrins and mixtures<br>
Another approach for tackling the problem of undesirable dye transfer is through the use of an oxidation catalyst that is capable of removing migrating dyes in the wash liquor, thereby preventing re-deposition. Such catalysts, e.g. selected manganese complexes, can be added into laundry detergents as special additives.<br>
Certain polymers have also been found to be useful in preventing migrating dyes from re-deposition. For examples, the use of polyvinyl pyridine) and its various derivatives and copolymers in preventing dye re-depositions can be found in the following references.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,348,441 discloses a method for laundering soiled fabrics using a nonaqueous detergent formulated to control dye transfer and sudsing in high efficiency washing machine. U.S. Patent No. 5,466,802 discloses the use of quaternary polyvinylpyrridinium derivatives as anti-dye transfer agent. U.S. Patent No. 6,306,815 discloses the use of quaternary polyvinylpyrridinium derivatives as anti-dye transfer agents. U.S. Patent No. 5,380,447 discloses a process and fabric finishing compositions for preventing the deposition of dye in fabric finishing processes. U.S. Patent No. 6,191,098 discloses polyvinylpyridinium derivatives as anti-dye transfer agents. U.S. Patent No. 6,156,829 discloses a product and process for making quatemized, water-soluble vinylpyridine carboxylate polymers. U.S. Patent No. 6,271,386 discloses a product and process for making quatemized, water-soluble vinylpyridine carboxylate polymers. U.S. Patent No. 6,103,831 discloses water-soluble dye complexing polymers. U.S. Patent No. 5,863,879 discloses dye transfer inhibitors for<br><br>
detergents (BASF, vinylamine derivatives). U.S. Patent No. 6,165,969 discloses the use of quaternized polymerizates containing units of vinyl imidazole as a color fixing and color transfer inhibiting additive to detergent post-treatment agents and detergents. U.S. Patent No. 5,830,844 discloses dye transfer inhibitors for detergents: Water-insoluble particles, crosslinked polymers containing polymerized units of 1-vinylpyrrolidone and/or 1-vinylimidazoles).<br>
Various derivatives based on vinylpyridinum, poly(vinylpyridine-N-oxide) have been found to be efficient dye transfer inhibitors. The preparation and application of such compounds have been documented in U.S. Patent No. 6,121,223 and U.S. Patent No. 5,149,456.<br>
Amine based products are believed to be able to provide dye transfer inhibition properties. For example, the use of N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine) as dye transfer inhibitors is explored in U.S. Patent No. 5,827,813. Other references relating to the use of amine based substances as dye transfer inhibitors include U.S. Patent No. 6,251,846, U.S. Patent No. 6,156,722 and U.S. Patent No. 6,140,292.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned references, the use of polyglycosides (U.S. Patent No. 6,159,921) and various enzymes exhibiting peroxidase activities (U.S. Patent No. 5,855,621) as dye transfer inhibitors is referred.<br>
In comparison to the seemingly plentiful references on various substances and their utilities as laundry detergents to provide dye transfer inhibition properties, there appears to be very few references on substances that could help prevent bleeding of dyes from fabrics. Among the very few citations, the use of bis-(hydroxyphenyl)sulfone with formaldehyde as dye bleeding prevention agent is reported in U.S. Patent No. 5,707,949.<br>
The use of nitrogen-containing polymers is known for use in laundry applications, particularly for soil-release properties. Published PCT application WO-A-98/23714 discloses water-soluble use of nitrogen-containing soil-release polymers in detergent products. Some of these polymers are formed from acrylamide monomers and are polymerized with co-monomers that are amines of alkylacrylates. A nitrogen-containing soil release polymer is described in WO-A-98/23714 and is formed from dicarboxylic acid monomers and hydrophilic co-monomers that are secondary amines, which contain (poly)alkyleneoxy groups. Published<br><br>
PCT application WO-A-98/23714 discloses polymers formed from alkyleneacrylate monomers having a terminal quaternary ammonium group and co-monomers, which are (meth)acrylic acid or esters or salts thereof. The only example is a polymer formed from a cationic monomer, namely methacrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC), and anionic monomer, namely acrylic acid (AA) and a neutral monomer, namely isobutylacrylate (IsoBuA).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,749,682 discloses copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and vinyl acetate for use as soil anti-redeposition agents.<br>
Published PCT application WO-97/42285 discloses cotton soil-release polymers comprising a polyamine backbone and quaternary ammonium cationic groups.<br>
Published European patent application 995,791 discloses a broad range of hydrophobically modified polycarboxylate polymers that are said to be useful for promoting soil release from fabrics, particularly cotton and cotton-containing fabrics. The polymers can comprise up to three moieties A, B and C wherein A is a polymerized residue of a monomer selected from one or more C3-C8 monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, B is a polymerized residue of a monomer selected from one or more C3-C60 alkyl (meth)acrylates, ethoxylated C1-C24 alkyl (meth)acrylates, and poly(alkylene glycol) (meth)acrylates, alkyl or aromatic ethers of poly(alkylene glycol) and the corresponding maleate mono and di-esters thereof, and C is a polymerized residue of a monomer selected from one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers which are copolymerizable with the monomers in A and B.<br>
According to published British patent application 2,104,091, copolymers of anionic and cationic vinyl monomers can be used as detergency builders, for a wide range of detergent products, e.g. for ware washing, hard surface cleaning, textile cleaning and hair products,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,783,533 discloses various amphoteric copolymers as rheological modifiers of lamellar phases of detergent or cosmetic compositions.<br>
JP-A-59135293 discloses detergent compositions, which contain an amphoteric copolymer consisting of at least 10 mol % cationic vinyl monomer units, at least 10 mol % anionic vinyl monomer units and at least 10 mol % nonionic vinyl monomer units. The preferred proportion<br><br>
of cationic vinyl monomer units to anionic vinyl monomer units is a molar ratio from 1:2 to 2:1.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,413,731 discloses water-soluble terpolymers, which are useful in automatic machine dishwashing detergent formulations. These terpolymers contain as polymerized units (a) from about 92 to about 30% by weight of one or more C3-C6 monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, (b) from about 5 to about 50% by weight of one or more aminoacryloyl derivatives, and (c) from about 25% by weight of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomers polymerizable with (a) and (b).<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One objective is to provide hydrophobically modified polymers that contain cationic groups, particularly DADMAC moieties and method(s) for the preparation thereof. Another objective is to provide methods of use of such polymers as laundry additives that inhibit the transfer of dyes or fix dyes on fabric surfaces to prevent bleeding. Polymers having both hydrophobic and cationic groups are believed to be able to enhance the substantivity of the polymer to the substrates thereby improving the efficiency of dye fixation where it is most needed. At the same time these polymers possess reasonable water solubility/dispersibility that can facilitate the complexing of the polymers with dyes already lost to the wash liquor (migrating dyes) thus preventing transfer of the dyes to other fabrics in the same laundry.<br>
Another objective is to provide methods of applications of such polymers in formulations that are used to treat surfaces at home or otherwise indoor environment to prevent staining. Examples of such surfaces include dishes in dishwashing applications, carpets, wood, laminate or other types of floors made of organic and inorganic materials.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide formulations of various laundry care products containing the polymers having both cationic and hydrophobic groups as additives. Such products include but not limited to laundry detergents, after rinse conditioners, pretreatment agents, tumble drier sheet, after-washing sprays etc. It is conceivable that such products could be in the form of liquid, granules, tablets, or any combinations thereof. The preparation of such formulations can be carried out using various processes, machineries known to those who are skilled in the art. It would also be obvious to those who are skilled in<br><br>
the art that such products could be packaged in various forms with various packaging materials.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide means of preparing various forms of laundry care products as aforementioned, but the performance of such products could be further enhanced by incorporation of other additives such as softeners, perfumes, soil release polymers, colorants, preservatives, antimicrobials with various activities against various microorganisms, insect repellents, dust mites repellents and/or otherwise controlling agents, optical brighteners, UV absorbers, other light management agents, ionization agents, antifoam agents, enzymes of various kind, bleaching agents, oxidation catalysts, zeolites, odor suppressing agents including but not limited to cyclodextrin and its various derivatives. It is obvious to those who are skilled in the art that other additives and/or agents can also be incorporated into laundry care products of any forms. An excellent description of typical laundry detergents and other laundry care products can be found in, though not limited to, U.S. Patent No. 5,744,435, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

(West Chester, Pa.)), ethoxylated pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (e.g., SR494, Sartomer Company, Inc.), and dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate (e.g., Photomer 4399, Henkel Corp., and SR399, Sartomer Company, Inc.);<br>

The preparation of the inventive polymers can be carried out using various polymerization techniques such as solution, emulsion, microemulsion, inverse emulsion, and/or bulk polymerizations, as well as other technologies that are available to those who are skilled in the art. The polymerization can obviously be carried out with or without various initiators of various concentrations. The co- or ter-polymers can also be prepared in such a way that the architecture of the polymers is random, block, alternating or core-shell with or without the use of polymerization regulators such as nitroxyl ether or other types of nitroxyl radicals.<br>
The preferred method for making the inventive polymers is by aqueous polymerization using a water-soluble initiator. Examples of the suitable initiators include persulfates such as ammonium persulfate (APS); peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and t-butyl peroxy pivalate, azo initiators such as 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 4,4'-azobis-4-cyanovaleric acid and 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile; and redox initiator systems such as t-butyl hydroperoxide/Fe(ll) and ammonium persulfate/bisulfite. Aqueous solution polymerization using ammonium persulfate (APS) is the preferred method for preparing the polymer having the preferred cationic DADMAC monomers. The amount of the free radical initiator used in the polymerization process depends on total monomer<br><br>
concentration and the type of monomers used and may range from about 0.2 to about 5.0 % by weight of total monomer charge to achieve more than 99% of total monomer conversion.<br>
Hydrophobic monomer (II) dissolves, at least in part, in the aqueous phase and copolymerizes with the preferred cationic monomer DADMAC to form a polymer having both cationic and hydrophobic groups. When hydrophobic monomer (II) is added to the polymerization system in an amount higher than its water solubility, the excess amount can form a second phase in fine droplets if adequate agitation is provided. Without intending to being bound to this polymerization mechanism, the droplets of monomer (II) may serve as a monomer reservoir to provide monomer (II) to the aqueous phase.<br>
When a water-soluble initiator is used, copolymerization of monomer (I) and the dissolved portion of the hydrophobic monomer (II) is initiated in the aqueous phase. The hydrophobically modified polymer thus formed may or may not be soluble in water depending on hydrophobicity or water solubility and the concentration of the monomer (II) used. The resulting polymer can possess surfactant properties and may occur in a colloidal state giving the appearance of translucence.<br>
The required amount of monomer (II) may be added all at the beginning, in increments, or added by continuous feeding to the reactor. Continuous feeding of hydrophobic monomer (II) to the aqueous reaction medium may have the advantage of producing hydrophobically modified copolymers with less formation of homopolymers or large homopolymeric segments.<br>
It is preferred to carry out the polymerization in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen can be removed from the reaction medium by applying vacuum with agitation or by purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The polymerization can then be conducted under a blanket of the inert gas.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymers being prepared can range from a thousand to millions. For example they have an average molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 5 million Daltons. The polymers can appear in various forms, i.e. solution, dispersion, suspension, granules, powders, beads, blocks, etc. In the case of liquid forms such as solution,<br><br>
dispersion, suspension etc., the liquid phase can be aqueous and/or non-aqueous such as soy bean oils, esters, and mineral oils.<br>

Such cleaning products may be in the form of a laundry detergent, fabric conditioner, pre-treatment agent, after treatment agent or tumble dry sheet having improved dye fixation and dye transfer inhibition. They may also be in the form of a dishwashing formulation. The inventive cleaning products comprise 0.001% to 50%, preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight of a polymeric compound of the invention.<br>

The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present in the laundry wash compositions according to the invention, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition. In fabric washing compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skilled formulator, for hand washing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machines. The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may be as high as 60% by weight, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand. In compositions for machine-washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 % by weight is generally appropriate. Typically the compositions will comprise at least 2 % by weight surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% and most preferably 25-35%.<br>
In the case of laundry rinse compositions according to the invention the surfactant(s) is/are preferably selected from fabric conditioning agents. In fact, conventional fabric conditioning agents may be used. These conditioning agents may be cationic or non-ionic. If the fabric<br><br>

This list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>
Still other materials that may be present in detergent compositions of the invention include other additives such as softeners, perfumes, soil release polymers, colorants, preservatives, antimicrobials with various activities against various microorganisms, insect repellents, dust<br><br>
mites repellents and/or otherwise controlling agents, optical brighteners, UV absorbers, other light management agents, ionization agents, antifoam agents, enzymes of various kinds, bleaching agents, oxidation catalysts, zeolites and odor suppressing agents including but not limited to cyclodextrin and its various derivatives.<br>
The inventive composition, when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle), will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 11, preferably from 7 to 10.5, for a wash product. Treatment of a fabric with a polymer having both cationic and hydrophobic groups in accordance with an aspect of the present invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or rinse cycle of a washing machine and involves contacting the fabric with an aqueous medium comprising the composition according to the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Compositions according to another aspect of the present invention may be formulated in any convenient form, for example as powders, liquids (aqueous or non-aqueous) or tablets.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry. The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions of the invention preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/l, more preferably at least 500 g/l. Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/liter, more preferably at least 700 g/liter.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densification of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br><br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form, which means it will contain a lower, level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
The following examples describe certain embodiments of this invention, but the invention is not limited thereto. It should be understood that numerous changes to the disclosed embodiments can be made in accordance with the disclosure herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. These examples are therefore not meant to limit the scope of the invention. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be determined only by the appended claims and their equivalents. In these examples all parts given are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1<br>
A 1-liter reactor equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, a nitrogen inlet, and an overhead agitator is charged with 453.8 g of 66% monomer DADMAC in water, 15.8 g of methyl methacrylate (MMA), 57.4.0 g of deionized water and 0.15 g of 20% Na4EDTA solution. The polymerization mixture is purged with nitrogen and heated with agitation to a temperature of 90° C. An aqueous solution containing 5.1 g of ammonium persulfate (APS) is slowly fed to the reactor over 190 minutes. The reaction temperature is allowed to increase to above 100° C and then maintained at reflux temperature (100 to 110° C) during the APS feed period. After the APS feed, the reaction temperature is lowered down to and held at 95° C for about 30 minutes. Then an aqueous solution containing 5.6 g of sodium metabisulfite (MBS) is added over 30 minutes. The reactor content is held at 95' C for another 30 minutes to complete the polymerization (above 99% conversion). The polymer solution is diluted with sufficient water to about 35% solids and cooled to room temperature. Total monomer conversion is measured to be above 99.5%. The final product has a Brookfield viscosity of 23,400 cps at 25' C and 33.7% polymer solids.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A1-liter reactor equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, a nitrogen inlet, and an overhead agitator is charged with 453.8 g of 66% monomer DADMAC in water, 15.8 g of ethoxylated nonylphenol acrylate (ENPA)), 57.4.0 g of deionized water and 0.15 g of 20% Na4EDTA solution. The polymerization mixture is purged with nitrogen and heated with agitation to a temperature of 90° C. An aqueous solution containing 5.1 g of ammonium persulfate (APS) is slowly fed to the reactor over 190 minutes. The reaction temperature is allowed to increase to above 100°C and then maintained at reflux temperature (100 to 110° C) during the APS feed period. After the APS feed, the reaction temperature is lowered down to and held at 95° C for about 30 minutes. Then an aqueous solution containing 5.6 g of sodium metabisulfite (MBS) is added over 30 minutes. The reactor content is held at 95° C for another 30 minutes to complete the polymerization (above 99% conversion). The polymer solution is diluted with sufficient water to about 35% solids and cooled to room temperature. Total monomer conversion is measured to be above 99.5%. The final product has a Brookfield viscosity of 15,700 cps at 25° C and 33.7% polymer solids.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example demonstrates addition of hydrophobic monomer II by feeding. The polymerization procedure is the same as example 1 except that the amount of 15.8 g methyl methacrylate is fed to the reactor over about 45 minutes when the APS initiator feed is started. The polymer solution is diluted with sufficient water to about 35% solids and cooled to room temperature. Total monomer conversion is measured to be above 99.5%. The final product has a Brookfield viscosity of 19,500 cps at 25° C and 35% polymer solids. The final polymer product is clear as compared to the emulsion appearance of the Example 1 product.<br>
Example 4: Application: Fix before wash I<br>
Fixation:<br>
The product is applied from an aqueous solution to a dyed fabric sheet ("Bleeder") and spin-dried.<br><br>
Wash:<br>
This treated fabric is washed together with a colorless Fabric ("Acceptor") using a standard detergent without any dye fixing or dye transfer-inhibiting agent. The fabrics are spin-dried, rinsed with clear water, spin-dried and dried at 60°C. In every subsequent wash cycle the "Acceptor" is replaced by a new one.<br>
Performance is assessed by the absorption (extinction at absorption maximum) of the Fix liquor, wash liquor and the dye deposition on the white "Acceptor" fabric (Delta E).<br>
The resulting absorption and Delta E values are used to calculate the corresponding amount of dyestuff. All results are given on the amount of dyestuff lost from one kg of dyed fabric.<br>
Application conditions:<br>
5g of a dyed cotton fabric (2.09% Direct Blue 78) are treated 15 minutes with 2.5g/l or 5g/l of a solution containing 1 % active matter of the polymer at a Liquor Ratio of 1:10 at 40° C. The fabric is removed from the liquor, spin dried and washed for 15 minutes together with 5g of a colorless cotton fabric "Acceptor" in a 2.5g/l ECE77 detergent solution a Liquor Ratio of 1:10 at 40°C. The fabrics are squeezed, rinsed under running tap water, spin-dried and dried in an oven at 60°C.<br>
This procedure is repeated 2 times with the same "Bleeder" using a new "Acceptor" in every wash.<br>
Results:<br>
[mg dye lost per kg of dyed fabric]<br><br><br>
Where Ex. 2 is a copolymer of DADMAC and acrylamide and TINOFIX CL is a commercial product from Ciba Specialty Chemicals.<br>
The results shown above indicate that the amount of dyes lost to the fix liquor, wash liquor and to the acceptor fabrics is much reduced when small amount of hydrophobically modified DADMAC polymer is used to treat the fabrics before washing; hence there is excellent performance in preventing dyes from bleeding.<br>
Example 5: Application: Fix during wash<br>
A colored fabric ("Bleeder") is washed together with a colorless Fabric ("Acceptor") using a standard detergent without any dye fixing or dye transfer-inhibiting agent. The dye-fixing polymer is added to the wash liquor just before the application. The fabrics are spin-dried, rinsed with clear water, spin dried and dried at 60°C. In every following wash cycle the "Acceptor" is substituted by a new one.<br>
Performance is assessed by the absorption (extinction at absorption maximum) of the Wash liquor and the dye deposition on the white "Acceptor" fabric (Delta E).<br>
The resulting absorption and Delta E values are used to calculate the corresponding amount of dyestuff. All results are given on the amount of dyestuff lost from one kg of dyed fabric.<br>
Application conditions:<br>
5g of a dyed cotton fabric (2.09% Direct Blue 78) and 5g of a colorless cotton fabric "Acceptor" in a 2.5g/l standard detergent ECE77 solution. The dye-fixing polymer is added to the detergent solution at 1% on weight of detergent just before application. The Liquor Ratio is 1:10 and the washing temperature is 40° C.<br>
The fabrics are squeezed, rinsed under running tap water, spin-dried and dried in an oven at 60°C.<br>
This procedure is repeated 2 times with the same "Bleeder" using a new "Acceptor" in every wash.<br><br>
Results:<br>
[mg dye lost per kg of dyed fabric]<br><br>
Where SOKALAN HP 56 and PVP K-30 are both commercially available poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-based anti-redeposition agents.<br>
Results as shown above indicate that when hydrophobically modified DADMAC polymers are added in small amounts to a laundry detergent, the amount of the dyes lost to the liquor is very much reduced. In addition, such polymers also help prevent the migrating dyes from redepositing in a way that is similar to the commercially available anti-deposition agents such as SOKALAN HP 56 and PVP K-30.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of hydrophobically modified polymers bv co-polvmerizing DADMAC with various hydrophobic monomers<br>
Hydrophobically modified polymers were prepared by co-polymerizing DADMAC with various amounts, i.e. 2.5%, 5% and 10% (w/w), of methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, benzyl methacrylate, using the procedure as described in Example 1.<br><br><br>
Application tests as described below were carried out to study the influence of the type of the hydrophobic monomers and/or the amount of hydrophobic monomer on the color fixation performance. It is noted that the examples are for illustration purposes only and the selection and usage of the hydrophobic monomers are by no means restricted by these examples.<br>
Example 7: Application: Fix before wash tests with hvdrophobicallv modified polymers prepared bv polymerizing DADMAC and various amount of methyl methacrvlate monomer<br>
The application conditions for this set of tests were modified slightly in comparison with what was described in Example 4. Thus, 5g Bleeder fabrics made of 100% cotton and dyed with 2.09% Direct Blue and/or 3.0% Direct Red 227 respectively were rinsed in an aqueous solution containing 5g/l of a 1% solution of the polymer being tested. The rinsing was carried out at 25° C for 30 minutes, at a 10:1 liquor ratio and water hardness 11° dH. The drying was carried out at room temperature<br>
This pre fixed Bleeder is washed together with: 5g Acceptor - bleached 100% cotton fabric 2.5g/l ECE 77 standard detergent Liquor ratio 10:1, water hardness 11° dH<br><br>
30° C, 15 Minutes.<br>
The amount of lost dye is calculated from the absorption of the wash liquor and the Delta E value of the Acceptor.<br>
The following results were obtained with Cotton dyed with D Blue 078 dye (results expressed as mg dyes lost per kg of dyed fabrics)<br><br>
Results obtained with Cotton dyed with D Red 227 dye (results expressed as mg dyes lost per kg of dyed fabrics)<br><br>
The results showed that the hydrophobically modified polymers were able to afford significant improvement in dye fixation performances and the degree of improvement was dependent on the amount of the hydrophobic monomers in the copolymers.<br>
Example 8: Application: Fix before wash tests with hvdrophobicallv modified polymers prepared bv polymerizing 95% of DADMAC and 5% of various hydrophobic monomers<br>
With exception of the polymers used in the tests, all other test conditions were the same as described in Example 7.<br><br>
Results obtained with Cotton dyed with D Blue 078 dyes (results expressed as mg dyes lost per kg of dyed fabrics)<br><br>
Results obtained with Cotton dyed with D Red 227 dye (results expressed as mg dyes lost per kg of dyed fabrics)<br><br><br>
The results showed that the hydrophobically modified polymers were able to afford significant improvement in dye fixation performances and the degree of improvement was dependent on the type of the hydrophobic monomers used in the copolymers.<br><br><br><br>
