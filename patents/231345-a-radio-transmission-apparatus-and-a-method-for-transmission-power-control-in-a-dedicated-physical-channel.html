				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A RADIO TRANSMISSION AppARATUS AND A METHOD FOR<br>
TRANSMISSION POWER CONTROL IN A DEDTCATED PHYSICAL CHANNEL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission<br>
apparatus and transmission method to perform radio<br>
transmission in which downlink shared channel such as DSCH<br>
(Downlink Shared Channel) and dedicated physical channel such<br>
as DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) are code-multiplexed,<br>
particularly, relates to a transmission apparatus and<br>
transmission method which carry out transmission power control<br>
in the DPCH.<br>
Background Art<br>
CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access ) system using spread<br>
spectrum technology as a multiple access method in which a<br>
plurality of communication apparatuses communicate mutually<br>
have been researched broadly, and practical use has been<br>
reached. The major advantage of the CDMA system is the ability<br>
to accommodate a large number of users because it can be designed<br>
to have a high-level of security, interference resistance and<br>
superior frequency efficiency. In addition, there is an<br>
increasing demand for transmitting a large amount of data such<br>
as image data, etc. within a short time in a downlink channel,<br>
with diversification of the recent services in the mobile<br>
communication field.<br><br>
Under the background of 3GPP (Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) which is one of the standard organizations<br>
relating to a CDMA system, use of DSCH as a common channel<br>
in high-speed data transmission of the downlink channel is<br>
under consideration. The DSCH is used in a cellular system<br>
as shown below. That is to say, a base station apparatus controls<br>
the transmission formats such as modulation method,<br>
transmission rate, user assignment, etc. of a DSCH channel<br>
every one frame, and the data is transmitted to a communication<br>
terminal apparatus . The control contents of such transmission<br>
formats are notified to a communication terminal apparatus<br>
using TFCI (Transmit Format Combination Indicator)included<br>
in DPCH which is assigned individually to each communication<br>
terminal apparatus. The communication terminal apparatus<br>
learns the transmission formats of the DSCH with reference<br>
to this TFCI, and can obtain the received data after<br>
demodulating the data of DSCH. Hence, those DSCH and DPCH are<br>
code-multiplexed and then transmitted.<br>
If a plurality of channels are code-multiplexed as<br>
described above, there is a problem that the signal to a target<br>
user could interfere the other users. The transmission power<br>
control, in which the effect of interference to other stations<br>
is reduced by adaptively changing the transmission power in<br>
the transmitting side so that an optimum reception level can<br>
be obtained in the receiving side, is widely known as a<br>
technology to reduce the interference to other stations.<br>
Among such a transmission power control, a closed-loop<br><br>
transmission power control in which a TPC (Transmit Power<br>
Control) command to instruct an increase/decrease of<br>
transmission power so that the SIR (Signal to Interference<br>
Ratio) which is measured in the communication terminal<br>
apparatus based on the receiving signal of the downlink channel<br>
approaches a predetermined desired SIR (hereinafter, it is<br>
referred to as "desired SIR") is generated, and the<br>
increase/decrease of the transmission power based on the TPC<br>
command, is performed in the base station apparatus.<br>
However, if DSCH and DPCH are multiplexed together, there<br>
is a problem that DSCH could be an interference to DPCH, and<br>
the transmission power control cannot be appropriately carried<br>
out in the DPCH. In other words, since a packet is transmitted<br>
in burst in DSCH, an interference level is rapidly fluctuated<br>
in the period where the packet is inserted as well as in the<br>
period where the packet is not inserted, and consequently,<br>
there is a problem that the transmission power control in DPCH<br>
cannot follow the rapid fluctuation of such an interference.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>

transmission apparatus and a transmission method that are<br>

power control section, and a radio transmission section which<br>

power was amplified by said amplification section and the<br>
downlink shared channel of which the packets are assigned in<br>
all data domain by said assignment section.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present<br>
invention, a transmission method comprises a transmission<br>
power control step of controlling the transmission power of<br>
a dedicated channel so that the transmission power in a period<br><br>
corresponding to a packet insertion period of a downlink shared<br>
channel becomes larger than other periods, an amplification<br>

channel in accordance with the control in said transmission<br>
power control step, and a radio transmission step to<br>

power was amplified in said amplification step and said<br>
downlink shared channel.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present<br>
invention, a transmission method comprises an assignment step<br>
of assigning packets to all data domain region of a downlink<br>
shared channel, a controlling step of controlling the<br>

controlling step, and a radio transmission step of<br>
code-multiplexing the dedicated channel of which transmission<br>
power was amplified in said amplification step and the downlink<br>
shared channel of which the packets are assigned in all data<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out. the Invention<br>
A first gist of the present invention is to keep the<br>
reception quality (for instance, SIR) in the receiving side<br>
within a predetermined range by increasing the transmission<br>
power of the period corresponding to packet insertion period<br>
of downlink shared channel (for instance, DSCH, etc.) among<br>
transmission power of dedicated channel (for instance, DPCH,<br><br>
etc.) to be larger than other periods. A second gist of the<br>
present invention is to keep the reception quality in the<br>
receiving side within a predetermined range by reducing the<br>
transmission rate and hence removing empty slots. Here, the<br>
predetermined range is the range from which the desired<br>
reception quality is attained in transmission power control.<br>
Hereafter, embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be described specifically with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
In each embodiment, DSCH is explained as an example of<br>
downlink shared channel employed commonly to all communication<br>
terminal apparatus of the respective cell. In addition, the<br>
DPCH is explained as an example of a dedicated channel assigned<br>
individually to each user. Services such as data communication,<br>
etc., of which the real-time communication is not required<br>
are mainly offered by DSCH whereas services such as speech<br>
communication, etc., of which real-time communication is<br>
required are offered by DPCH. Moreover, SIR is explained as<br>
an example of the reception quality.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic configuration of a radio<br>
communication system including a transmission apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
As shown in this drawing, base station apparatus 10<br>
communicates with communication terminal apparatuses<br>
accommodated in the same cell (hereinafter, it is referred<br><br>
to as "MS" ) numbered from 20-1 to 20-N through a bi-directional<br>
propagation path, uplink and downlink. That is to say, base<br>
station apparatus 10 transmits data signals or control signals,<br>
etc., on the downlink channel using DSCH and DPCH while MS<br>
20-1 to 20-N transmit data signals or control signals, etc.,<br>
on the uplink channel using DPCH. Those DSCH and DPCH are<br>
separated by mutually-different spreading code assigned to<br>
each. Additionally, the uplink and downlink DPCH are separated<br>
based on frequency division or time division.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a configuration of<br>
a transmission apparatus provided in the base station apparatus<br>
10 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
First, the DSCH serial configuration which is mainly<br>
consisting of frame configuration section 101-0, spreading<br>
section 102-0 and modulating section 103-0 will be explained.<br>
Frame configuration section 101-0 performs time-division<br>
multiplexing on the transmission data addressed to each user,<br>
and the transmission signal of a DSCH sequence is generated.<br>
The transmission signal of the generated DSCH sequence is<br>
subjected to spreading processing in spreading section 102-0,<br>
modulated in modulating section 103-0 by a predetermined<br>
modulation method and outputted to multiplexing section 106.<br>
Next, the first DPCH serial configuration which is mainly<br>
consisting of frame configuration section 101-1, spreading<br>
section 102-1, modulating section 103-1 and amplification<br>
section 104-1 will be explained. In such a first DPCH sequence,<br>
a transmission signal addressed to MS20-1 is generated. That<br><br>
is to say, frame configuration section 101 time-multiplexes<br>
the transmission data addressed to MS20-1, pilot symbol (PL)<br>
and TFCI, and a transmission signal which is addressed to MS20-1<br>
is generated. The generated transmission signal addressed to<br>
MS20-1 is subjected to spreading processing in spreading<br>
section 102-1, modulated in modulating section 103-1 by a<br>
predetermined modulation technique, amplified in<br>
amplification section 104-1 based on the control of DPCH<br>
transmission power control and outputted to multiplexing<br>
section 106. Next, the transmission signals addressed to MS<br>
20-1 up to MS 20-N are generated in a similar way as the first<br>
DPCH sequence in the second DPCH sequence up to the Nth DPCH<br>
sequence, and the generated transmission signal which is<br>
addressed to every MS is outputted to multiplexing section<br>
106.<br>
DPCH transmission power control section 105 detects the<br>
period where the packet is inserted and the period where the<br>
packet is not inserted in the DSCH channel based on TFCI while<br>
controlling the transmission power in the amplification<br>
sections 104-1 to 104-N based on TPC commands obtained by MS<br>
20-1 to MS 20-N, controls amplification section 104-1 to<br>
amplification section 104-N and increases the transmission<br>
power of the DPCH periods with a predetermined amount according<br>
to the periods where the packets are inserted in the DSCH<br>
(hereinafter, it is referred to as "packet insertion period" ).<br>
Multiplexing section 10 6 code-multiplexes the<br>
transmission signal of the DSCH sequence and the transmission<br><br>
signal addressed to MS 20-1 to MS 20-N and outputs the result<br>
to RF section 107. RF section 107 frequency-converts the<br>
multiplexing signal transmitted from multiplexing section 106<br>
into a radio frequency bandwidth and transmits the result as<br>
radio signal from antenna 108.<br>
An operation of the radio communication section which<br>
has the aforementioned configuration will be explained below.<br>
The transmission data to be transmitted using DSCH is<br>
frame-configured in frame configuration section 101-0,<br>
subjected to spreading processing using a predetermined<br>
spreading code in spreading section 102-0, modulated in<br>
modulating section 103-0 using a predetermined modulation<br>
method and outputted to multiplexing section 106.<br>
On the other hand, the transmission data addressed to<br>
MS 20-1 to MS 20-N are frame-configured in frame configuration<br>
sections 101-1 to 101-N, subjected to spreading processing<br>
using predetermined spreading codes in spreading sections<br>
102-1 to 102-N, modulated using predetermined modulation<br>
method in modulating sections 103-1 to 103-N, amplified based<br>
on the control of DPCH transmission power control section 105<br>
in amplification sections 104-1 to 104-N, respectively, and<br>
outputted to multiplexing section 106.<br>
In multiplexing section 106, the transmission signal<br>
addressed to MS 20-1 to MS 20-N and transmission signal of<br>
DSCH sequence are both code-multiplexed and outputted to RF<br>
section 107. The multiplexed signal is frequency-converted<br>
into a radio frequency bandwidth in RF section 107 and<br><br>
transmitted as radio signal from antenna 108.<br>
Accordingly, the signal transmitted from base station<br>
apparatus 10 is received by each of the MS 20-1 to MS 20-N.<br>
In each of the MS 20-1 to MS 20-N, the received signal is<br>
subjected to despreading processing, the DSCH and DPCH assigned<br>
to the respective MS are extracted from the received signal.<br>
Each of the MS 20-1 to MS 20-N detects the extracted desired<br>
signal power of the DPCH of the addressed MS and interference<br>
signal power, obtains the SIR by calculating the ratio between<br>
those desired signal power and interference signal power. MS<br>
20-1 to MS 20-N, thus, compares the above measured SIR<br>
(hereinafter, it is referred to as "measured SIR") with a<br>
previously set standard SIR, when the measured SIR is larger<br>
than standard SIR a TPC command which indicates a decreasing<br>
of transmission power is generated, on the contrary, when the<br>
measured SIR is smaller than standard SIR a TPC command which<br>
indicates an increasing of transmission power is generated.<br>
The generated TPC command is transmitted to base station<br>
apparatus 10.<br>
The SIR measured in the communication terminal apparatus<br>
of the radio communication system according to the present<br>
invention will be explained below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
First, in the DSCH sequence of base station apparatus<br>
10, packets 301 addressed to each user that is time-multiplexed<br>
in the transmission signal 302 of the DSCH sequence are<br>
generated. In the present specification, those inserted<br>
packets 301 are called "packet insertion period". The periods<br><br>
where packets 301 are not inserted among transmission signal<br>
302, that is to say, the periods excluding those where packets<br>
are inserted in, became an empty slots 303 in DSCH. Since packets<br>
301 are transmitted with a constant power which is<br>
comparatively larger than the zero transmitted power in the<br>
periods which became an empty slot 303 in DSCH, the transmission<br>
power rapidly fluctuates in the periods excluding the packet<br>
inserted periods.<br>
In DPCH sequence of base station apparatus 10, the<br>
transmission data of an addressed MS corresponds to such a<br>
DPCH sequence is multiplexed with PL and TFCI, amplified in<br>
amplification section 104-1 to 104-N based on the control of<br>
DPCH transmission power control section 105, and transmission<br>
signal of DPCH sequence is generated. Because DPCH transmission<br>
power control section 105 controls amplification sections<br>
104-1 to 104-N so that the transmission power of the periods<br>
correspond to DSCH packet insertion period becomes larger than<br>
the transmission power in other periods, the transmission power<br>
of the periods correspond to DSCH packet insertion period in<br>
DPCH becomes larger than that of other periods.<br>
According to the amplified DPCH received by MS 20-1,<br>
the desired signal power 305 is detected in MS 20-1. The<br>
interference signal power 306 is also detected in MS 20-1.<br>
Due to the interference caused in DSCH, the interference signal<br>
power 306 in the periods correspond to DSCH packet insertion<br>
periods suddenly becomes larger than that of other periods.<br>
Because the transmission power of DPCH is increased by<br><br>
the control of DPCH transmission power control section 105<br>
in the period in which the interference signal power 306 is<br>
increased, namely, in packet insertion period, desired signal<br>
power 305 follows the interference signal power 306. The<br>
measured SIR 3 07 obtained by calculating the ratio between<br>
such a desired signal power 305 and interference signal power<br>
306 serves generally as a constant value, and fluctuates around<br>
the standard SIR 3 08 within a predetermined range of the<br>
permissible SIR. In other words, DPCH transmission power<br>
control section 105 increases the transmission power of the<br>
periods corresponding to packet insertion period by an<br>
increasing rate so that the measured SIR approaches the<br>
permissible SIR range. Such an increasing rate can be<br>
calculated by using parameters assigned beforehand in the<br>
system such as DSCH transmission power or power step of the<br>
permissible SIR range, etc.<br>
Such a permissible SIR range shows the range which is<br>
permitted as the value that the measured SIR takes in<br>
transmission power control. That is, if the measured SIR 307<br>
takes a value smaller than the permissible SIR range, the<br>
reception quality will be deteriorated so that it cannot be<br>
approved in the system, and if the measured SIR 307, on the<br>
other hand, takes a value larger than the permissible SIR range,<br>
interference to other channels which is not permissible becomes<br>
large.<br>
Moreover, because the control of increasing the<br>
transmission power of DPCH in packet insertion period is<br><br>
performed by DPCH transmission power control section which<br>
is provided in base station apparatus 10 in the present<br>
embodiment, it is possible to keep the measured SIR within<br>
the permissible SIR range even in the case when the interference<br>
by DSCH is increased suddenly.<br>
For comparison purpose, the measured SIR in the case<br>
when using the conventional transmission power control after<br>
code-multiplexing DSCH and DPCH will be explained here with<br>
reference to FIG. 4. In addition, the portions shown in FIG.<br>
4 which are similar to those shown in FIG. 3 are assigned the<br>
same reference numerals as in FIG. 3, and explanations thereof<br>
are omitted.<br>
Because the control of increasing the transmission power<br>
control is not carried out particularly in other periods than<br>
the packet insertion periods in the conventional transmission<br>
power control, the transmission power of DPCH is<br>
increased/decreased based on the TPC command, and transmission<br>
signal 401 of DPCH sequence is generated. Hence, the<br>
transmission signal of DSCH is the same in FIG. 3 and FIG.<br>
4. The transmission signal 401 of DPCH sequence is received<br>
in MS 20-1, and the desired signal power 402 is detected.<br>
Additionally, the interference signal power 306 in the MS 20-1<br>
is the same as that in FIG. 3. The SIR measurement is obtained<br>
when taking the ratio between the desired signal power 402<br>
and interference signal power 306 . The measured SIR 403 cannot<br>
follow the sudden increasing of the interference amount in<br>
packet insertion period of DSCH, and it will be less than the<br><br>
minimum of the permissible SIR range in packet insertion period.<br>
Hence, the reception quality will be deteriorated in the period<br>
where the measured SIR was less than the minimum of the<br>
permissible SIR range.<br>
According to the aforementioned description of the<br>
present embodiment, it is possible to change the measured SIR<br>
within the permissible SIR range by increasing the transmission<br>
power of DPCH in packet insertion period more than that of<br>
other periods by DPCH transmission power control section 105.<br>
Therefore, transmission power control of DPCH according to<br>
the present embodiment can be carried out with sufficient<br>
accuracy even in the case when the interference amount is<br>
suddenly increased by DSCH.<br>

a transmission apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the<br>
present invention. The transmission apparatus according to<br>
the present embodiment changes the configuration of the<br>
transmission apparatus provided in base station apparatus of<br>
the radio communication system described in Embodiment 1 by<br>
adding more sections. In addition, the corresponding similar<br>
sections shown in FIG. 2 according to Embodiment 1 are assigned<br>
the same reference numerals in FIG. 5 and explanations thereof<br>
are omitted. Decreasing the data rate of DSCH before<br>
transmission is the big different point between the<br>
transmission apparatus according to the present embodiment<br><br>
and transmission apparatus according to Embodiment 1.<br>
Monitoring section 5 03 monitors DSCH referring to TPCI<br>
and detects empty slot which exists in DSCH. When the existence<br>
of empty slot is detected in monitoring section 503, rate<br>
updating section 501 reduces the transmission rate of DSCH<br>
in order to remove the empty slot. In other words, when the<br>
existence of empty slot is detected in monitoring section 503,<br>
rate updating section 501 allocates the data packet in DSCH<br>
so that the packet occupies all the domain region valuable<br>
for packet allocation ( hereinafter, it is referred to as "data<br>
domain region" ) . The DPCH transmission power control section<br>
502 controls the transmission power in amplification sections<br>
104-1 to 104-N based on a TPC command obtained by MS 20-1 to<br>
MS 20-N.<br>
The SIR measurement in communication terminal apparatus<br>
of the radio communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment will be explained below with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
Moreover, the portions in FIG. 6 similar to those in FIG. 4<br>
are assigned the same reference numerals and explanation<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
In DSCH sequence of the base station apparatus 10, the<br>
transmission signal 6 02 of the DSCH sequence is generated by<br>
time-multiplexing the packets 601 of each addressed user. Since<br>
the transmission rate is reduced by rate updating section 501,<br>
the transmission signal 602 of the DSCH sequence allocates<br>
the packets in all data domain region to remove the empty slots .<br>
However, the transmission power of transmission signal 602<br><br>
of DSCH sequence is always fixed. The interference signal power<br>
603 in MS 20-1 to MS 20-N generally has constant value because<br>
there is no sudden increasing of the interference by DSCH.<br>
The SIR 604 is measured by calculating the ratio between<br>
the aforementioned desired signal power 3 05 and interference<br>
signal power 306. As described above, the measured SIR 604,<br>
in general, has a constant value or fluctuates within the<br>
permissible SIR range since there is no sudden increasing of<br>
the interference of DSCH.<br>
According to the above description of the present<br>
embodiment, since rate updating section 501 reduces the DSCH<br>
transmission rate so that no empty slots exist, sudden<br>
fluctuation in the transmission power of DSCH will not be<br>
generated. Thus, even when DPCH and DSCH are employed commonly<br>
to carry out communication, a high precis ion transmission power<br>
control in the DPCH can be performed as it is possible to prevent<br>
the measured SIR 604 to fluctuate, due to sudden fluctuation<br>
of the interference signal power, out of the permissible SIR<br>
range.<br>
Moreover, when empty slot in DSCH is generated as<br>
described above in accordance to the present invention, the<br>
transmission power of DSCH is kept constant by reducing the<br>
transmission rate to remove the empty slot, but as a practical<br>
method to reduce the transmission rate, for instance,<br>
increasing of spreading factor can be considered. FIG. 7 is<br>
a block diagram slowing an exemplary configuration of a<br>
transmission apparatus of such a case. Sections in FIG. 7<br><br>
similar to those in FIG. 5 are assigned the same reference<br>
numerals and explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
Spreading factor updating section 701 increases the<br>
spreading factor in order to reduce the transmission rate of<br>
DSCH to remove the empty slot in the case when the existence<br>
of empty slots is detected in monitoring section 503. That<br>
is to say, when there is a signal of the same information rate,<br>
for instance, a half-rate (1/2) signal can be transmitted if<br>
doubling the spreading factor which is taken as an advantage<br>
to control the transmission rate.<br>
Moreover, because there is a possibility that buffer<br>
702 of the base station apparatus 10 is overloaded and may<br>
cause losing of data if the data rate of the original signal<br>
source (data generating section 703) is not reduced even if<br>
the rate of the signal which is transmitted over a radio channel<br>
(transmission rate) is reduced, such an effect is notified<br>
to the signal source (data generating section 7 03) so as to<br>
reduce data rate of the signal source (data generating section<br>
703). Here, data generating section 703, for instance, is an<br>
arbitrary terminal apparatus (personal computer, telephone,<br>
etc.) which is connected to network 7 04 and it is connected<br>
with base station apparatus 10 via network 704. Of course,<br>
such a notification device can be added to the configuration<br>
shown in FIG. 5 (more general configuration having rate<br>
updating section 501).<br>
As described above in accordance to the present<br>
embodiment, for example, since the desired signal power of<br><br>
DPCH can follow the sudden fluctuations of the interference<br>
signal power in DSCH by increasing the transmission power of<br>
the dedicated channel (such as DPCH, etc.) in the periods<br>
corresponding to the periods (packet insertion periods) in<br>
which the interference in downlink shared channel (such as<br>
DSCH, etc.) was increased, it is possible to execute an<br>
appropriate transmission power control in the dedicated<br>
channel even in the case when downlink shared channel such<br>
as DSCH and dedicated channel such as DPCH are multiplexed<br>
together.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, since<br>
it is possible to keep the transmission power of a downlink<br>
shared channel constant by assigning packets in all data domain<br>
region of the downlink shared channel (such as DSCH, etc.)<br>
so that empty slots are no longer exist in the downlink shared<br>
channel, sudden fluctuations of interference signal power no<br>
longer occurred and hence appropriate transmission power<br>
control in the dedicated channel can be executed even in the<br>
case when downlink shared channel such as DSCH and dedicated<br>
channel such as DPCH are multiplexed together. The assignment<br>
of packets in all data domain region is performed by reducing<br>
the transmission rate of data, for example, when there is empty<br>
slot in the downlink shared channel.<br>
The present application is based on the Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2001-005678 filed on January 12, 2001, entire<br>
