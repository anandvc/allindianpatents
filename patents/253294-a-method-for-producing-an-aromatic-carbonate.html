				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING; AROMATIC CARBONATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing an aromatic carbonate. More specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to a method capable of<br>
producing a high purity aromatic carbonate in a stable<br>
manner for a long period, which comprises allowing to<br>
react a starting material selected from the group<br>
consisting of a dialkyl carbonate, an alkylaryl<br>
carbonate and a mixture thereof and a reactant selected<br>
from the group consisting of an aromatic monohydroxy<br>
compound, an alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture thereof<br>
in the presence of a metal-containing catalyst which<br>
has a molecular weight of 450 or more and which is in<br>
the form of liquid or dissolved in a liquid phase in<br>
the reaction system, with distilling off by-product<br>
alcohol and/or by-product dialkyl carbonate to the<br>
outside of the reaction system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Aromatic carbonate is useful as a raw<br>
material for producing aromatic polycarbonate which is<br>
recently becoming more and more important as an<br>
engineering plastic, without using poisonous phosgene,<br>
or as a raw material for producing isocyanate without<br>
using poisonous phosgene. Referring to the method of<br><br>
producing an aromatic carbonate, a method is known,<br>
which comprises subjecting dialkyl carbonate, alkylaryl<br>
carbonate or a mixture thereof which is a starting<br>
material and an aromatic monohydroxy compound, an<br>
alkylaryl carbonate or a mixture thereof which is a<br>
reactant to an transesterification to produce a<br>
corresponding aromatic carbonate or an aromatic<br>
carbonate mixture.<br>
However, all such transesterification are an<br>
equilibrium reaction, and due to the reactant-favored<br>
equilibrium and its low reaction rate, industrial<br>
production of aromatic carbonate by this method has<br>
been very difficult. Several approaches have been<br>
proposed in order to make this method improvements, and<br>
most of them relate to catalysts for increasing the<br>
reaction rate and a number of metal-containing<br>
catalysts are known. In a method for producing<br>
alkylaryl carbonate, diaryl carbonate or a mixture<br>
thereof by a reaction between dialkyl carbonate and an<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound, the following catalysts are<br>
proposed as such catalysts: Lewis acid such as<br>
transition metal halide or a compound which produces<br>
Lewis acid (Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2,<br>
Patent Document 3 (which is corresponding to Patent<br>
Documents 4 to 6)), tin compounds such as organic tin<br>
alkoxide and organic tin oxide (Patent Document 7<br>
(which is corresponding to Patent Document 8)), Patent<br>
Document 9, Patent Document 10 (which is corresponding<br><br>
to Patent Document 11), Patent Document 12 (which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Document 13), Patent Document<br>
14, and Patent Document 15), salts and alkoxides of<br>
alkali metal or alkaline earth metal (Patent Document<br>
16), lead compounds (Patent Document 16), complexes of<br>
metal such as copper, iron or zirconium (Patent<br>
Document 17), titanates (Patent Document 18 which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Document 19), a mixture of<br>
Lewis acid and protonic acid (Patent Document 20 which<br>
is corresponding to Patent Document 21), a compound of<br>
Sc, Mo, Mn, Bi, Te (Patent Document 22) and ferric<br>
acetate (Patent Document 23).<br>
In addition, in a method of producing diaryl<br>
carbonate by disproportionation of diaryl carbonate and<br>
diaryl carbonate by an transesterification between the<br>
same kind of molecules of alkylaryl carbonate, the<br>
following catalysts are proposed as such catalysts:<br>
Lewis acid and a transition metal compound which can<br>
produce Lewis acid (Patent Document 24 which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Documents 25 and 26), a<br>
polymeric tin compound (Patent Document 27 which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Document 28), a compound<br>
represented by the formula R-X(=O)OH (in which X is<br>
selected form Sn and Ti and R is selected from<br>
monovalent hydrocarbon groups) (Patent Document 29<br>
which is corresponding to Patent Document 30), a<br>
mixture of Lewis acid and protonic acid (Patent<br>
Document 31 which is corresponding to Patent Document<br><br>
32), a lead catalyst (Patent Document 33), a titanium<br>
or zirconium compound (Patent Document 34), a tin<br>
compound (Patent Document 35) and a compound of Sc, Mo,<br>
Mn, Bi, Te (Patent Document 36).<br>
On the other hand, it is also attempted to<br>
improve the yield of aromatic carbonate by shifting the<br>
equilibrium to the product side as much as possible by<br>
designing a suitable reaction system. For example, a<br>
method in which by-product methanol is distilled off<br>
together with an azeotropic agent by azeotropic<br>
distillation in a reaction between dimethyl carbonate<br>
and phenol (Patent Document 37 and corresponding Patent<br>
Documents 38 and 39, Patent Document 40) and a method<br>
in which by-product methanol is removed by adsorption<br>
using molecular sieve (Patent Document 41 which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Document 42) are proposed.<br>
Further, a method in which alcohol produced<br>
by the above-mentioned reaction is distilled off from a<br>
reaction mixture using an apparatus having a<br>
distillation column on the upper part of a reactor is<br>
also known (Examples of Patent Document 43 which is<br>
corresponding to Patent Document 44, Examples of Patent<br>
Document 45, Examples of Patent Document 46 and<br>
corresponding Patent Document 47, Examples of Patent<br>
Document 48 which is corresponding Patent Document 49,<br>
Examples of Patent Document 50 which is corresponding<br>
Patent Document 51), Examples of Patent Documents 52,<br>
53 and 54).<br><br>
More preferable methods include a method in<br>
which dialkyl carbonate and an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound are continuously supplied to a multi-stage<br>
distillation column and continuously reacted in the<br>
column while continuously removing produced low boiling<br>
point components including alcohol by distillation and<br>
extracting generated products containing alkylaryl<br>
carbonate from the bottom of the column (Patent<br>
Document 55), and a method in which alkylaryl carbonate<br>
is continuously supplied to a multi-stage distillation<br>
column and continuously reacted in the column while<br>
removing produced low boiling point components<br>
including dialkyl carbonate by distillation and<br>
extracting generated products containing diaryl<br>
carbonate from the bottom of the column (Patent<br>
Document 56). These methods are the first disclosures<br>
of efficient and continuous production of aromatic<br>
carbonate. Similar continuous production methods have<br>
been thereafter filed, such as a method in which<br>
materials are brought into contact in a column type<br>
reactor to perform transesterification (Patent<br>
Documents 57, 58 and 59), a method in which a plurality<br>
of reaction vessels are connected in series (Patent<br>
Documents 60 and 61), a method in which a bubble column<br>
reactor is used (Patent Document 62) and a method in<br>
which a vertical reaction vessel is used (Patent<br>
Document 63).<br>
Regarding industrial production of aromatic<br><br>
carbonate by these methods, methods for stable and<br>
long-term operation have also been proposed. Patent<br>
Document 64 discloses a method in which aliphatic<br>
alcohol is removed from a distillation column connected<br>
to a reactor so that the concentration of the aliphatic<br>
alcohol in the reactor is 2% by weight or less upon<br>
production of aromatic carbonate from dialkyl carbonate<br>
and an aromatic hydroxy compound, and it is described<br>
that stable continuous operation was achieved. The<br>
method of the publication is directed to avoid problems<br>
of precipitation of catalyst in the distillation<br>
column. Further, Patent Document 65 discloses a method<br>
which enables long-term stable operation by suppressing<br>
precipitation of catalyst by controlling the weight<br>
ratio of an aromatic polyhydroxy compound and/or a<br>
residue thereof to 2 or less relative to the metal<br>
component of the catalyst in a liquid matter in the<br>
system containing the catalyst.<br>
On the other hand, the catalyst used in this<br>
reaction system is usually dissolved in a reaction<br>
mixture under reaction conditions, and has a higher<br>
boiling point than aromatic carbonate. Therefore, to<br>
obtain high purity aromatic carbonate from the reaction<br>
mixture, low boiling point components are first removed<br>
from the mixture and then diaryl carbonate of the high<br>
boiling point components is separated from the catalyst<br>
so as to purify the diaryl carbonate. It is known that<br>
the catalyst may be recovered and reused as a high<br><br>
boiling point component in that case, and deactivated<br>
components may be removed. Examples of such method of<br>
separating catalyst are described in Patent Document<br>
66.<br>
Titanium compounds are known to be an<br>
excellent catalyst (e.g., Patent Documents 67 and 68).<br>
However, when titanium based catalysts, for example,<br>
titanium phenoxide: Ti(OPh)4 or titanium alkoxide:<br>
Ti(OR)4, is used, there is a problem that diaryl<br>
carbonate which is the final product is colored with<br>
dark red as described in Patent Document 69. This is<br>
because, since titanium butoxide: Ti(OBu)4 typically<br>
used has a boiling point of 206°C at 1.3 KPa and<br>
titanium phenoxide typically used has a boiling point<br>
of about 250°C at about 27 Pa (No patent Document 1),<br>
they are also distilled off in a proportion<br>
corresponding to their vapor pressure upon separation<br>
of diaryl carbonate by distillation and therefore not<br>
sufficiently separated from the product. Further, as<br>
described in Patent Document 70, degradation of<br>
catalyst and deterioration of diaryl carbonate due to<br>
high temperature in separation of titanium phenoxide<br>
have been reported. Also, Patent Document 71 describes<br>
a problem that when Ti(OPh)4 is used and a mixture of<br>
starting materials and a catalyst is supplied to a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column to continue<br>
the reaction, the distillation column may be clogged.<br>
Thus, the well-known titanium based catalysts have<br><br>
problems that due to their high vapor pressure under<br>
reaction conditions, separation of produced diaryl<br>
carbonate is difficult, and the fraction at high<br>
temperature for a long period causes degradation of<br>
catalyst, clogging of the distillation column and<br>
deterioration of diaryl carbonate.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to<br><br>
provide a method of producing high purity diaryl<br>
carbonate in which a catalyst can be easily separated<br>
without the above-described problems, when producing an<br>
aromatic carbonate by allowing to react a starting<br>
material selected from the group consisting of a<br>
dialkyl carbonate, an alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture<br>
thereof and a reactant selected from the group<br>
consisting of an aromatic monohydroxy compound, an<br>
alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture thereof in the<br>
presence of a metal-containing catalyst, with<br>
distilling off by-product alcohol and/or by-product<br>
dialkyl carbonate to the outside of the reaction<br>
system.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PLOBLEMS<br>
As a result of intensive studies conducted by<br>
the present inventors to solve the aforementioned<br>
problems, the inventors have found that the object can<br>
be achieved by using a specific metal-containing<br>
catalyst as a catalyst when producing an aromatic<br>
carbonate by allowing to react a starting material<br>
selected from the group consisting of a dialkyl<br>
carbonate, an alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture thereof<br>
with a reactant selected from the group consisting of<br>
an aromatic monohydroxy compound, an alkylaryl<br>
carbonate and a mixture thereof in the presence of a<br>
metal-containing catalyst, with distilling off by-<br>
product alcohol and/or by-product dialkyl carbonate to<br><br>
the outside of the reaction system, and the present<br>
invention has been completed. Surprisingly, the<br>
present invention can solve the problem of conventional<br>
method that clogging and blocking of distillation<br>
column frequently occur when reactants and a catalyst<br>
are supplied to the middle plate of/the distillation<br>
column, and the present invention also makes it easier<br>
to separate produced diaryl carbonate from other<br>
components and thus can produce high purity diaryl<br>
carbonate in which the amount mixed of a metal compound<br>
derived from a catalyst is extremely small.<br>

Although titanium-based catalysts have excellent catalytic action<br>
including a good reaction rate and selectivity as described above, it was<br>
difficult to separate such titanium catalyst or a titanium containing<br>
compound<br>
derived from the titanium catalyst from produced diaryl carbonate in the<br>
reaction mixture after the reaction and to obtain diaryl carbonate whose<br>
titanium content is small. A novel finding that use of a specific titanium<br>
catalyst facilitates separation has made it possible for the first time to<br>
obtain diaryl carbonate whose titanium content is small without difficulty.<br>
According to the present invention, diaryl carbonate whose<br>
titanium content is small can be easily produced without causing problems such<br>
as coloring due to titanium.<br>

The alkylaryl carbonate used as a reactant in<br>
the present invention is represented by the following<br>
formula (4).<br><br>
In the formula, R3 may be the same as or<br>
different from R1 and R2, and represents an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alicyclic group having<br>
3 to 10 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, and Ar3 may be the same as or different<br>
from Ar1 and Ar2, and represents an aromatic group<br>
having 5 to 30 carbon atoms. Examples of such R3 are<br>
groups listed above as R1, and examples of Ar3 are those<br>
listed above as Ar2.<br>
Examples of alkylaryl carbonates containing<br>
such R3 and Ar3 are those listed above as in the formula<br>
(2). Of these alkylaryl carbonates, those whose R3 has<br>
an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and Ar3 is an<br>
aromatic group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms are<br>
preferably used. R3 is more preferably an n-butyl<br>
group, an isobutyl group or a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group having 5 to 6 carbon atoms in which the carbon<br>
atom at the a position of oxygen is secondary carbon (-<br>
CH2-). Particularly preferred are butyl phenyl<br><br>
carbonate and (2-ethylbutyl) phenyl carbonate.<br>
The reactant of the present invention is<br>
selected from the group consisting of an aromatic<br>
monohydroxy compound represented by the formula (3), an<br>
alkylaryl carbonate represented by the formula (4) and<br>
a mixture thereof. The method of the present invention<br>
for producing an aromatic carbonate or an aromatic<br>
carbonate mixture, which comprises allowing to react a<br>
starting material and a reactant in the presence of a<br>
metal-containing catalyst typically involves the<br>
reactions of the formulas (E1), (E2), (E3) and (E4).<br><br>
(In the formulas, R1, R2, R3, Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3<br>
are as defined above; in the reaction formula (E4), Ar<br>
independently represents Ar2 or Ar3 and R independently<br>
represents R2 or R3; when R2=R3 and Ar2=Ar3 in the<br>
reaction formula (E4), the reaction is an<br>
transesterification between the same kind of molecules,<br><br>
which may also be generally referred to as a<br>
disproportionation reaction.)<br>
When carrying out reactions of the formulas<br>
(E1), (E2), (E3) and (E4) according to the method of<br>
the present invention, one or at least two dialkyl<br>
carbonates and alkylaryl carbonates may be used as<br>
starting materials. Further, one or at least two<br>
aromatic monohydroxy compounds and alkylaryl carbonates<br>
may be used as reactants.<br>
A case in which R2=R3=R and Ar2=Ar3=Ar in the<br>
transesterification represented by the reaction formula<br>
(E4) is preferred because diaryl carbonate and dialkyl<br>
carbonate are obtained by an transesterification of the<br>
same kind of molecules of one alkylaryl carbonate.<br>
Further, when R1=R2=R3=R and Ar1=Ar2=Ar3=Ar in the<br>
reaction formulas (E1) and (E4), diaryl carbonate is<br>
obtained from dialkyl carbonate and an aromatic<br>
monohydroxy compound through alkylaryl carbonate as<br>
described in the following reaction formulas (E5) and<br>
(E6) by combining the reaction represented by the<br>
reaction formula (E1) and the reaction represented by<br>
the reaction formula (E4), and this is a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br>
When dialkyl carbonate produced as a by-<br>
product in the reaction represented by the reaction<br>
formula (E6) is reused as a raw material of the<br>
reaction represented by the reaction formula (E5), 1<br>
mole of diaryl carbonate and 2 moles of aliphatic<br>
alcohol are produced from 1 mole of dialkyl carbonate<br>
and 2 moles of an aromatic monohydroxy compound. In<br>
the above-described reaction formula (E5), when R is<br>
selected from n-butyl, iso-butyl and an alkyl group<br>
having 5 to 6 carbon atoms and Ar=C6H5, by-product<br>
alcohol has the lowest boiling point in the reaction<br>
system and forms no azeotrope with dialkyl carbonate<br>
which is a reactant. This case is particularly<br>
advantageous because the reaction proceeds efficiently<br>
and easily produces diphenyl carbonate which is an<br>
important raw material of polycarbonate and isocyanate.<br>
The metal-containing catalyst used in the<br>
present invention means a specific metal-containing<br>
catalyst which facilitates the aforementioned reactions<br>
of the reaction formulas (E1) to (E4), has a molecular<br>
weight of 450 or more, more preferably a molecular<br>
weight of 480 or more, and is in the form of liquid<br>
(under the above-described reaction conditions) or<br><br>
dissolved in the liquid phase of the reaction system.<br>
The metal-containing catalyst is preferably a titanium<br>
containing compound containing titanium. Examples of<br>
preferred titanium containing compounds in the form of<br>
liquid under the above-described reaction conditions or<br>
dissolved in the liquid phase of the reaction system<br>
include organopolytitanoxane composition such as<br>
polyorthotitanate and condensed orthotitanate. It is<br>
preferred that the organic polytitanoxane has at least<br>
one alkoxy group and/or aryloxy group as an organic<br>
group.<br>
When the metal-containing catalyst is a<br>
metal-containing catalyst containing titanium and/or a<br>
metal-containing catalyst having a vapor pressure at<br>
230°C of 10 Pa or lower and containing titanium, the<br>
catalyst preferably contains at least two Ti atoms in<br>
one molecule, more preferably 2 to 6 Ti atoms in one<br>
molecule. When the metal-containing catalyst contains<br>
2 or more Ti atoms in one molecule, the compound<br>
contains at least one Ti-O-Ti bond in one molecule.<br>
When the metal-containing catalyst contains Sn, it<br>
contains at least 3 Sn atoms.<br>
Examples of such compounds include metal-<br>
containing catalysts represented by the following<br>
formulas (11), (12) and (13), titanate oligomers<br>
containing at least one titanoxane structure (Ti-O-Ti<br>
bond) (e.g., titanium compounds represented by the<br>
following formula (14)) in one molecule and tin<br><br>
compounds represented by the following formula (15).<br>
Since the above-described metal-containing catalysts<br>
are easily associated, they may be in the form of a<br>
monomer, in an associated form, or an adduct or an<br>
associated form with alcohol or an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound. These catalytic components may be a product<br>
of a reaction with an organic compound present in the<br>
reaction system, e.g., aliphatic alcohols, an aromatic<br>
monohydroxy compounds, alkylaryl carbonates, diaryl<br>
carbonates or dialkyl carbonates, or may be heated in<br>
the form of a raw material or a product prior to the<br>
reaction. The titanium compound represented by the<br>
formula (11) and/or the formula (14) (e.g., when R44 to<br>
R61 in the formula (14) are aromatic groups (e.g.,<br>
phenyl group)) tends to form an adduct particularly<br>
with an aromatic hydroxy compound. The structure of<br>
the adduct is unknown by the present analytical<br>
methods, but the structure represented by the following<br>
formula has a molecular weight of 450 or more, more<br>
preferably a molecular weight of 480 or more, excluding<br>
the molecular weight of the molecules involved in the<br>
formation of an adduct. Such molecules involved in the<br>
formation of an adduct may be identified by a method<br>
such as NMR, or the aromatic hydroxy compound involved<br>
in the formation of an adduct may be removed by a known<br>
method (e.g., recrystallization using solvent described<br>
in J. Indian. Chem. Soc, Vol. 38, No. 3, 147-152<br>
(1961)).<br><br><br>

Examples of compounds represented by the<br>
formula (11) include titanium methylphenoxide:<br>
Ti(OPhMe)4 and titanium dimethylphenoxide:<br>
Ti(OPh(Me)2)4.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (12)<br>
has a valence of Ti of 4, and the compound may contain<br>

alcoholate or phenolate. Examples of compounds of the<br>
formula (12) include compounds of the following formula<br>
(27) .<br><br><br>
Examples of compounds represented by the<br>
formula (13) include titanium-disalicylate, titanium-<br>
bis(2-methyl salicylate) and titanium-bis(3-methyl<br>
salicylate).<br>
Of the titanium containing compounds, an<br>
organic polytitanoxane composition produced by a known<br>
method may be used. Such known methods include a<br>
method in which titanium alkoxide is partially<br>
hydrolyzed and subjected to polycondensation while<br>
removing alcohol (e.g., Journal of Polymer Science,<br>
vol. VII, No. 6, 591-602). Examples of such<br>
polytitanoxane compositions also include ladder<br>
polytitanoxane obtained by the method described in JP-<br>
A-1-129031 and cyclic titanoxane obtained by the method<br>
described in JP-A-1-31793, JP-A-1-52786 and JP-A-64-<br>
52786.<br><br>
Further, a copolymer with another metal<br>
alkoxide obtained by the method described in JP-B-5-<br>
31900 may be also used. Polytitanoxane or<br>
copolytitanoxane having 2 or more, preferably 2 to 6,<br>
more preferably 4 to 6 Ti atoms in a molecule is<br>
preferably used. These polytitanoxane and<br>
copolytitanoxane may contain at least one Ti-O-Ti bond<br>
in a molecule. Although analysis of Ti-O-Ti bonds is<br>
extremely difficult, researchers in this field now<br>
consider that a Ti-O-Ti bond is formed when titanium<br>
alkoxide described above is partially hydrolyzed and<br>
subjected to polycondensation with removing alcohol,<br>
and the present invention also follows this argument.<br>
Specifically, as shown in the following formula (28),<br>
one Ti-O-Ti bond is formed by partially hydrolyzing<br>
titanium(tetraalkoxide) by adding one molecule of water<br>
per two molecules of titanium(tetraalkoxide) and then<br>
removing two molecules of alcohol.<br>
Further, in the case of a oligomerization<br>
reaction, polytitanoxane having a few Ti-O-Ti bonds in<br>
a molecule can be obtained by adding water in an amount<br>
suitable for the oligomerization degree and removing<br>
produced alcohol. In order to obtain a titanium<br>
compound containing 2 to 6 Ti atoms in a molecule,<br>
tetraalkoxytitanium is partially hydrolyzed by water of<br>
not more than 0.1 to 2-fold mole in a molar ratio<br>
relative to Ti atoms, preferably by water of not more<br>
than 0.3 to 1.5-fold mole, more preferably by water of<br><br>
not more than 0.5 to 1.2-fold mole in order to avoid<br>
generation of solid components caused by excessive<br>
partial hydrolysis; and then can be obtained by the<br>
polycondensation which removes low boiling point<br>
components. The amount of water used for partial<br>
hydrolysis described above is based on the total amount<br>
of tetraalkoxytitanium used for producing an organic<br>
polytitanoxane composition. All of water necessary for<br>
partial hydrolysis may be used for partial hydrolysis<br>
of part of the tetraalkoxytitanium used for production,<br>
and then the rest of the tetraalkoxytitanium is added<br>
thereto to perform a reaction. In this case, an<br>
organic polytitanoxane composition containing many<br>
branched structures can be obtained. Solid components<br>
generated during partial hydrolysis may be removed by<br>
filtration. Referring to the partial hydrolysis,<br>
tetraalkoxytitanium is dissolved in an alcohol solvent<br>
and the solution is cooled to 80°C or lower, preferably<br>
5°C or lower, then alcohol containing a desired amount<br>
of water is added thereto dropwise over 1 to 5 hours<br>
under stirring, the solution temperature is adjusted to<br>
30°C to 150°C, and the low boiling point components are<br>
removed by distillation. The reaction may be<br>
terminated when alcohol is no longer extracted. A<br>
known reactor may be used, and preferred is a stirring<br>
vessel in which cooling and heating can be performed.<br>
Thus, in the method of producing organic polytitanoxane<br>
of the present invention, organic polytitanoxane can be<br><br>
obtained by sequentially or simultaneously performing<br>
the two steps of: 1) preparing a partially hydrolyzed<br>
product by partially hydrolyzing tetraalkoxytitanium<br>
and 2) removing the generated low boiling point<br>
component including alcohol from the partially<br>
hydrolyzed product and subjecting the product to<br>
polycondensation.<br>
Alternatively, an organic polytitanoxane<br>
composition may be obtained by partially hydrolyzing<br>
tetrahalotitanium (TiX4: X=Cl, Br), removing -HX<br>
therefrom and subjecting the resultant to a<br>
polycondensation reaction, or by removing -HX from<br>
titanium hydroxide and tetrahalotitanium and subjecting<br>
the resultant to a polycondensation reaction. Also<br>
preferred is an organic polytitanoxane composition<br>
obtained by sequentially or simultaneously performing<br>
the three steps of: 1) preparing a partially hydrolyzed<br>
product by partially hydrolyzing tetrahalotitanium, 2)<br>
removing a low boiling point component from the<br>
partially hydrolyzed product and subjecting the product<br>
to polycondensation and 3) reacting the resultant with<br>
alcohol, removing HX therefrom and alkoxylating the<br>
same.<br>
It is also possible to dealcoholize titanium<br>
hydroxide and tetraalkoxytitanium and subject the<br>
resultant to polycondensation.<br>
Another well-known method for producing an<br>
organic titanoxane composition comprises subjecting<br><br>
tetraalkoxytitanium to heating, deetherification and<br>
polycondensation. Preferably used is an organic<br>
polytitanoxane composition obtained after removing 0.1<br>
to 2-fold mole, preferably 0.3 to 1.5-fold mole, more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 1.2-fold mole of ether based on<br>
titanium atoms contained in tetraalkoxytitanium at a<br>
deetherification temperature of 100°C to 300°C,<br>
preferably 150°C to 250°C over 1 to 300 hours.<br>
These known organic polytitanoxanes obtained<br>
by a polycondensation reaction of at least one raw<br>
material selected from tetraalkoxytitanium,<br>
tetrahalotitanium (TiX4: X being selected from Cl and<br>
Br) and titanium hydroxide can be used in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The above-described organic polytitanoxane<br>
and metal-containing catalyst may be used as is, or<br>
after exchange of organic groups before use. For<br>
example, they may be used after exchange of alkoxy<br>
groups by reacting with a composition containing at<br>
least one component selected from alcohol, an aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound and carbonic acid ester. In other<br>
words, they may be used after mixing or reacting with a<br>
starting material, a reactant or a by-product of an<br>
transesterification or a disproportionation reaction in<br>
the present invention.<br>
When a conventional organic titanate is used,<br>
more specifically when dimethyl carbonate is used as a<br>
starting material, phenol is used as a reactant and<br><br>
phenyl titanate [Ph(OPh)4] (phenol adduct also usable)<br>
is used as organic titanate to produce an aromatic<br>
carbonate, specifically, methyl phenyl carbonate,<br>
methyl titanate [Ti(OMe)4] may be generated in the<br>
distillation column in the equilibrium reaction due to<br>
alkoxy exchange. Since methyl titanate is hardly<br>
soluble in the reaction mixture and is subliming, it<br>
may adhere to the wall of the distillation column to<br>
cause clogging. Surprisingly, however, it has been<br>
found that the organic polytitanoxane composition<br>
(titanate oligomer, etc.) used in the present invention<br>
hardly causes such poor solubility or adhesion to walls<br>
due to sublimation.<br>
Whether a Ti-O-Ti bond is present or not may<br>
be simply confirmed by elemental analysis of the<br>
catalyst and NMR. When the structure of an organic<br>
group bonded or coordinated to Ti is known, the amount<br>
of bridging oxygen derived from Ti-O-Ti can be<br>
determined by subtracting the amount of oxygen atoms<br>
derived from the organic group from the elemental<br>
analysis value. The number of bridging oxygen involved<br>
in Ti-O-Ti bonds and the number of the bonds may be<br>
determined from the ratio of the amount of Ti atoms to<br>
the amount of bridging oxygen. In addition, the<br>
valence of Ti and the number of oxygen atoms involved<br>
in Ti-O-Ti may be determined by known X-ray<br>
crystallographic analysis (e.g., JP-A-2004-256719),<br>
assuming that a Ti-O bond is present when the atomic<br><br>
distance between Ti and 0 is smaller than the sum (2.87<br>
A) of the ionic radii of Ti atom and oxygen atom.<br><br>
In addition, such polytitanoxane or<br>
copolytitanoxane obtained by a known method may be<br>
alkoxy-substituted by reacting with alcohol or an<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound by a known method (e.g., J.<br>
inorg. nucl. Chem., Vol. 28, 2410 (1966), J. Indian<br>
Chem. Soc, Vol. 38, No. 3, pl47-152 (1961)). These<br>
catalytic components may be a product of a reaction<br>
with an organic compound present in the reaction<br>
system, e.g., aliphatic alcohols, aromatic monohydroxy<br>
compounds, alkylaryl carbonates, diaryl carbonates or<br>
dialkyl carbonates or may be heated prior to the<br>
reaction in the form of a raw material or a product, or<br>
low boiling point components may be removed therefrom<br>
upon heating. The catalyst may be an adduct or an<br>
associated form with alcohol or an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound present in the reaction system.<br>
The structure of polytitanoxane obtained by<br>
the above-mentioned method is shown in the above-<br>
described formula (14).<br>
Examples of such titanium compounds include<br><br>
1) linear polytitanate represented by the following<br>
formula (29) and cyclic polytitanate represented by the<br>
following formula (30).<br><br>
(In the formula (29), R72 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an aralkyl, aryl or<br>
acyl group, R72 may be the same or different from each<br>
other or may be bonded with each other, and h is an<br>
integer of 1 to 5).<br><br>
(In the formula (30), R73 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an aralkyl, aryl or<br>
acyl group, R73 may be the same or different from each<br>
other or may be bonded with each other, and i is an<br>
integer of 1 to 4, j is an integer of 0 to 4, and<br>
i+j=4.)<br><br>
When R72 in the formula (29) and R73 in the<br>
formula (30) have a small number of carbon atoms, the<br>
catalyst itself may not be in the form of liquid, or<br>
may not be in the form of liquid in the reaction system<br>
because it has extremely low solubility in the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction system. Thus, preferred examples<br>
of R72 and R73 are an alkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms such as a propyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
butyl group (and isomers thereof), a pentyl group (and<br>
isomers thereof), a hexyl group (and isomers thereof),<br>
a heptyl group (and isomers thereof), an octyl group<br>
(and isomers thereof), a nonyl group (and isomers<br>
thereof), a decyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
cyclobutyl group, a cyclopentyl group (and isomers<br>
thereof) and a cyclohexyl group (and isomers thereof).<br>
Those containing an ether bond are also useful, and<br>
examples thereof include alkyl groups such as a<br>
methoxyethyl group (and isomers thereof), an<br>
ethoxyethyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
methoxypropyl group (and isomers thereof), an<br>
ethoxypropyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
methoxybutyl group (and isomers thereof) and an<br>
ethoxybutyl group (and isomers thereof). Preferred<br>
examples thereof also include aralkyl groups having 7<br>
to 12 carbon atoms which may have a substituent, such<br>
as a benzyl group and a phenylethyl group. Preferred<br>
examples thereof also include aryl groups, e.g. phenyl<br>
or alkylphenyl groups such as phenyl, tolyl (and<br><br>
isomers thereof), xylyl (and isomers thereof),<br>
trimethylphenyl (and isomers thereof),<br>
tetramethylphenyl (and isomers thereof), ethylphenyl<br>
(and isomers thereof), propylphenyl (and isomers<br>
thereof), butylphenyl (and isomers thereof) ,<br>
diethylphenyl (and isomers thereof), methylethylphenyl<br>
(and isomers thereof), pentylphenyl (and isomers<br>
thereof), hexylphenyl (and isomers thereof) and<br>
cyclohexylphenyl (and isomers thereof); alkoxyphenyl<br>
groups such as methoxyphenyl (and isomers thereof),<br>
ethoxyphenyl (and isomers thereof) and butoxyphenyl<br>
(and isomers thereof); halogenated phenyl groups such<br>
as fluorophenyl (and isomers thereof), chlorophenyl<br>
(and isomers thereof), bromophenyl (and isomers<br>
thereof), chloro(methyl)phenyl (and isomers thereof)<br>
and dichlorophenyl (and isomers thereof).<br>
Examples of such compounds include compounds<br>
whose structural formula is as described below, e.g.,<br>
butoxy titanate dimer, phenoxy titanate oligomers such<br>
as phenoxy titanate dimer, phenoxy titanate trimer and<br>
phenoxy titanate tetramer (and isomers thereof),<br>
phenoxy salicyl titanate oligomers such as phenoxy-<br>
salicyl-titanate dimer and phenoxy-salicyl-titanate<br>
trimer, titanate dimer (derived from phenol and<br>
bisphenol A) and titanate trimer (derived from phenol<br>
and bisphenol A). Compounds containing 2 to 6 Ti atoms<br>
in a molecule are preferred in terms of their<br>
solubility. Titanate oligomers have molecular weight<br><br>
distribution, and they may contain a component which<br>
does not satisfy the molecular weight of 450 or more<br>
defined in the present invention, or contain a<br>
component whose vapor pressure at 230°C is 10 Pa or<br>
higher. Such titanate oligomers may be used as is, but<br>
they may be used after removing low boiling point<br>
components or low molecular weight components by<br>
distillation.<br><br><br><br>
These catalytic components may be a product<br>
of a reaction with an organic compound present in the<br>
reaction system, e.g., aliphatic alcohol, an aromatic<br><br>
monohydroxy compound, alkylaryl carbonate, diaryl<br>
carbonate or dialkyl carbonate or may be heated prior<br>
to the reaction in the form of a raw material or a<br>
product, or low boiling point components may be removed<br>
therefrom upon heating.<br>
Examples of compounds represented by the<br>
formula (15) include monoalkyltin (IV) alkoxide oxide.<br>
Among the scientists of the research field concerned,<br>
it is a common knowledge that no Sn=O double bond is<br>
generally present and monoalkyltin (IV) alkoxide oxide<br>
is usually present in the form of an oligomer of bonded<br>
molecules. Examples of such compounds include butyltin<br>
(IV) butyloxide oxide, butyltin (IV) (2-<br>
ethylbutyloxide) oxide, butyltin (IV)(3-<br>
methoxypropyloxide) oxide, butyltin (IV) (2-<br>

ethoxyethoxide) oxide, butyltin (IV) phenoxide oxide,<br>

ethylbutyloxide) oxide, octyltin (IV) (3-<br>
methoxypropyloxide) oxide, octyltin (IV) (2-<br>
methoxyethoxide) oxide, octyltin (IV) (2-<br>
ethoxyethoxide) oxide and octyltin (IV) phenoxide<br>
oxide.<br>
The types of the reaction vessel used in the<br>
present invention are not particular limited, and any<br>
conventional reaction vessel such as a stirring vessel,<br>
a multi-stage stirring vessel, a multi-stage<br>
distillation column or a combination of these may be<br><br>
used. These reaction vessels may be used for either a<br>
batchwise reaction or a continuous reaction. In order<br>
to efficiently shift the equilibrium of the reaction in<br>
the direction of the product system, a process using a<br>
multi-stage distillation column is preferred, and a<br>
continuous process using a multi-stage distillation<br>
column is more preferred. Multi-stage distillation<br>
columns have two or more theoretical distillation<br>
stages, and any type may be used as long as it is<br>
capable of performing continuous distillation.<br>
As such a multi-stage distillation column,<br>
any generally used multi-stage distillation column may<br>
be used, and examples thereof include plate type<br>
columns using a tray such as a bubble-cap tray, a sieve<br>
tray, a valve tray or a counterflow tray, and packed<br>
type columns packed with any of various packings such<br>
as a Raschig ring, a Lessing ring, a Pall ring, a Berl<br>
saddle, an Interlox saddle, a Dixon packing, a McMahon<br>
packing, a Heli pack, a Sulzer packing and Mellapak.<br>
Further, a plate-packed column combined type having<br>
both a plate column section and a packed column section<br>
with packings may also be preferably used. When a<br>
continuous process using a multi-stage distillation<br>
column is applied to the production of aromatic<br>
carbonates, starting materials and reactants are<br>
supplied to a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column and these materials are allowed to react with<br>
each other in the presence of a metal-containing<br><br>
catalyst in a liquid phase or in a gas-liquid phase in<br>
the distillation column while simultaneously extracting<br>
the produced high boiling point reaction mixture<br>
containing aromatic carbonate or an aromatic carbonate<br>
mixture in a liquid form from the bottom of the column,<br>
while continuously distilling off the produced low<br>
boiling point reaction mixture containing a by-product<br>
in the form of gas from the upper part of the<br>
distillation column by distillation.<br>
The catalyst in the present invention is used<br>
in a proportion of usually 0.0001 to 30% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, more preferably 0.01<br>
to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the raw<br>
materials, although the proportion depends on the kind<br>
of the catalyst used, the kind and the amount of raw<br>
materials and reaction conditions such as reaction<br>
temperature and reaction pressure. The reaction time<br>
(residence time in a continuous process) in the present<br>
invention is not particular limited, and is usually<br>
0.001 to 50 hours, preferably 0.01 to 10 hours, more<br>
preferably 0.05 to 5 hours.<br>
The reaction is performed at a reaction<br>
temperature of usually 50 to 350°C, preferably 100 to<br>
280°C depending on the kind of raw material compounds<br>
used. The reaction is performed under reduced<br>
pressure, atmospheric pressure or increased pressure,<br>
usually at 0.1 to 2.0xl07 Pa depending on the kind of<br>
the raw material compounds used and the reaction<br><br>
temperature. In the present invention, it is not<br>
always necessary to use a reaction solvent, but an<br>
appropriate inert solvent such as ether, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon or halogenated<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon may be used as a reaction solvent<br>
in order to facilitate the reaction procedure.<br>
The present invention has a feature that<br>
liquid containing high boiling point materials and a<br>
metal-containing catalyst is removed from the reaction<br>
system and produced aromatic carbonate is transported<br>
in the form of gas, and the liquid containing the<br>
metal-containing catalyst is recycled in the system.<br>
In this process, part of the liquid<br>
containing a metal-containing catalyst may be blown<br>
down and a fresh catalyst may be added to the liquid.<br>
Also, the liquid may be reacted with an active<br>
substance to produce a reaction mixture of a substance<br>
derived from a high boiling point material and a<br>
substance derived from a metal-containing catalyst, and<br>
the mixture is separated into a component composed<br>
mainly of a substance derived from a high boiling point<br>
material and a component composed mainly of a substance<br>
derived from a metal-containing catalyst, and the<br>
substance derived from a metal-containing catalyst may<br>
be recycled in the system.<br>
The term "reaction system" refers to the<br>
space inside the reactor, piping and equipment<br>
surrounding the reactor, equipment and piping for the<br><br>
catalyst recovery system. The "liquid containing a<br>
high boiling point material and a metal-containing<br>
catalyst" in the present invention refers to liquid<br>
containing a catalyst and a high boiling point material<br>
supplied to the reactor, a reaction mixture containing<br>
a catalyst and a high boiling point material present in<br>
the reactor, a reaction mixture containing a catalyst<br>
and a high boiling point material discharged from the<br>
reactor and a concentrated liquid having increased<br>
concentration of a catalyst and a high boiling point<br>
material by evaporation of part of the reaction<br>
mixture. The catalyst may be completely dissolved in<br>
the liquid or present in the form of slurry. In the<br>
case of slurry, undissolved portions in the slurry are<br>
also included in the "liquid containing a high boiling<br>
point material and a metal-containing catalyst".<br>
The "high boiling point material" in the<br>
present invention is an organic substance whose boiling<br>
point is the same as or higher than that of aromatic<br>
carbonate produced in the present invention. Examples<br>
thereof include aromatic polyhydroxy compounds and<br>
residues thereof, aromatic carboxyl compounds and<br>
residues thereof and xanthones. Another example of<br>
such high boiling point material is a high molecular<br>
weight by-product produced by an additional reaction of<br>
the above-described aromatic polyhydroxy compounds and<br>
residues thereof, aromatic carboxyl compounds and<br>

An active substance in the present invention<br>
is a substance that reacts with a high boiling point<br>
material and/or a metal-containing catalyst, and any<br>
substance may be used as long as a separable reaction<br>
mixture is produced as the result of the reaction. For<br>
example, the active substance includes an oxidizing<br>
agent, a reducing agent, a precipitating agent, an<br>
adsorption agent, a reactive solvent or the like. In<br>
particular, the oxidizing agent, precipitating agent,<br>
reactive solvent or the like are preferably used.<br>
These active substances may be used singly, or in<br>
combination of 2 kinds and further simultaneously or<br>
sequentially.<br>
The product derived from the high boiling<br>
point substance in the present invention is the<br>
reaction products and/or un-reacted high boiling point<br>
substances that results from the reaction between the<br>
high boiling point substance and the active substance.<br>
Also the product derived from the metal-<br>
containing catalyst is the reaction products and/or un-<br>
reacted metal-containing catalyst that results from the<br>
reaction between the metal-containing catalyst and the<br>
active substance.<br><br>
The separation of the reaction mixture<br>
containing the product derived from the high boiling<br>
point substance and the product derived from the metal-<br>
containing catalyst may be carried out by any<br>
separation method as long as the method is able to<br>
separate this reaction mixture into two components, one<br>
that mainly contains the product derived from the high<br>
boiling point substance and the other that mainly<br>
contains the product derived from the metal-containing<br>
catalyst. For example, gas-condensation phase<br>
separation methods such as gas-liquid separation, gas-<br>
solid separation, gas-solid liquid phase separation or<br>
the like method; solid-liquid separation methods such<br>
as sedimentation, centrifugation, filtration or the<br>
like method; distillation method; extraction method;<br>
adsorption method; or the like may be used, and<br>
preferably, separation methods such as sedimentation,<br>
distillation, and adsorption are used. Further, these<br>
separation methods may be used singly, or in<br>
combination of the two or more methods simultaneously<br>
or sequentially.<br>
The combination of this active substance and<br>
the separation method is not limited in particular, but<br>
the preferred methods for carrying out the present<br>
invention includes as follows.<br>
(I) The gas-condensation phase separation<br>
method, wherein the active substance is an oxidizing<br>
agent, the reaction is an oxidizing reaction, the<br><br>
product derived from the high boiling point material<br>
are low boiling point oxidized products, and the<br>
product derived from the metal-containing catalyst is<br>
metalic oxide.<br>
(II)	The solid-liquid separation method,<br>
wherein the active substance is a precipitating agent,<br>
the reaction is the precipitating reaction, and the<br>
product derived from the metal-containing catalyst is<br>
the metal containing solid substance which presents in<br>
the reaction mixture.<br>
(III)	The distillation separation method,<br>
wherein the active substance is a reactive solvent, the<br>
reaction is the solvolysis, and the product derived<br>
from high boiling point material is one of the<br>
solvolysis with low boiling point.<br>
On using the aforementioned method of (I),<br>
the oxidizing agent to be used is the one that oxidizes<br>
high boiling point material producing low boiling point<br>
oxidation products as the derivatives of the high<br>
boiling point material, and that oxidizes the metal-<br>
containing catalyst producing metalic oxide as the<br>
product derived from the metal-containing catalyst.<br>
Examples of those oxidizing agents include: air,<br>
molecular oxygen, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, silver<br>
oxide; organic peroxides such as peracetic acid,<br>
perbenzoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tert-<br>
butylhydroperoxide, cumyl hydroperoxide or the like;<br>
oxo-acids such as nitrous acid, nitric acid, chloric<br><br>
acid, and hypochlorous acid' and salts thereof or the<br>
like. Air, molecular oxygen, ozone, hydrogen peroxide,<br>
nitrous acid, and nitric acid are preferably used, and<br>
more preferably air and molecular oxygen are used.<br>
The reaction between the liquid and an<br>
oxidizing agent is carried out in a phase selected from<br>
the group consists of liquid phase, gas-liquid mixed<br>
phase and gas-liquid solid mixed phase, although the<br>
reaction depends on the kind of the oxidizing agent and<br>
the reaction conditions. The reaction temperature,<br>
although it may be varied depending on the kind of<br>
oxidizing agent used, is normally -30-2000°C, preferably<br>
0-1200°C and more preferably 0-900°C. The reaction<br>
time, although it may be varied depending on the kind<br>
of the oxidizing agent and the reaction time, is<br>
normally 0.001-100 hours, preferably 0.1-20 hours. The<br>
reaction pressure is normally carried out under 10-107<br>
Pa, and preferably 102-3 x 106 Pa. This reaction may be<br>
carried out in a batch reaction or in continuous<br>
reaction.<br>
In the method of the aforementioned (I), the<br>
separation of the reaction mixture is carried out by<br>
gas-condensation phase separation. The condensation<br>
phase means liquid phase, solid phase or mixed phase of<br>
solid and liquid. If the reaction mixture of the<br>
aforementioned oxidizing reaction is in liquid phase at<br>
the end of the oxidizing reaction, gas liquid mixed<br>
phase or gas liquid solid mixed phase, the condensed<br><br>
phase components consisting of mainly metal oxide may<br>
be obtained: by carrying out phase separation of the<br>
reaction mixture into the gas phase components<br>
consisting of mainly low boiling point products of<br>
oxidization and the condensation phase containing metal<br>
oxides; and by distilling or evaporating low boiling<br>
point oxidation products from the obtained condensation<br>
phase components.<br>
If the metal-containing catalyst in the<br>
liquid is oxidized to metal oxide forming solid phase<br>
during the progression of the aforementioned oxidation<br>
reaction, the solid liquid mixture may be obtained<br>
while the reaction is in progress.<br>
Further, the oxidation reaction mixture may<br>
be converted into solid phase only by evaporating the<br>
low boiling point oxidation product, which is produced<br>
by the oxidation of the high boiling point material,<br>
together with the volatile components in the liquid.<br>
This is the preferred method because, simultaneously<br>
with the oxidizing reaction, the solid phase which<br>
mainly consists of metal oxide is separated from the<br>
gas phase containing the low boiling point oxidation<br>
product.<br>
The low boiling point oxidation product is a<br>
compound that is produced by the oxidation of a high<br>
boiling point material by the oxidizing agent, having a<br>
lower boiling point than that of the high boiling point<br>
material. The examples of the low boiling point<br><br>
oxidation product include carbon dioxide, water, carbon<br>
monoxide, organic compounds containing oxygen,<br>
unsaturated organic compounds, the high boiling point<br>
materials with reduced carbons or the like, although<br>
they may be varied depending on the kind of the<br>
oxidizing agent and high boiling point material used.<br>
The metal oxide is the oxide of the metal in<br>
the metal-containing catalyst, and includes TiO, Ti2O3,<br>
TiO2 or the like. When a metal-containing catalyst<br>
having a plurality of metals is used, a mixture of the<br>
corresponding metal oxides and/or the complex metal<br>
oxide is obtained.<br>
In case the method of aforementioned (II) is<br>
used, this metal containing substance may be any metal<br>
containing substance as long as it exists as the solid<br>
in this reaction mixture and contains this metal. For<br>
example, it includes: a metal hydroxide; a metal<br>
chalcogenide such as metal oxide, a metal sulfide or<br>
the like; an inorganic acid salt such as metal<br>
carbonate, metal sulfate or the like; metal organic<br>
acid salt; metal complex; metal double salt or the<br>
like. Metal carbonates, metal hydroxides, metal<br>
oxides, metal sulfides and metal sulfates are<br>
preferable because their solubility in this reaction<br>
mixture is low. The reactive substance, starting<br>
material or the like may coordinate with these metal-<br>
containing substances.<br>
Any precipitating agent may be used that<br><br>
reacts with the metal-containing catalyst producing the<br>
metal containing substance described above. For<br>
example, to precipitate these metal hydroxides,<br>
inorganic hydroxides such as alkali metal hydroxides,<br>
alkali earth metal hydroxide or the like, and water are<br>
used. In order to precipitate these metal oxides,<br>
inorganic oxides such as alkali metal oxides, alkali<br>
earth metal oxides or the like, and oxidizers such as<br>
hydrogen peroxide or the like are used. In order to<br>
precipitate these metal sulfides, inorganic sulfides<br>
such as alkali metal sulfide, alkali earth sulfide or<br>
the like, and hydrogen sulfide are used. In order to<br>
precipitate these metal carbonate, inorganic carbonate<br>
salts such as alkali metal carbonates, alkali earth<br>
metal carbonates or the like, and carbonic acid, carbon<br>
dioxide and water are used. In order to precipitate<br>
these metal sulfate, inorganic sulfate salts such as<br>
alkali metal sulfate, alkali earth metal salt or the<br>
like, sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide and water are<br>
used.<br>
The reaction between the metal-containing<br>
catalyst and the precipitating agent, although it may<br>
be varied depending on the kinds of the catalyst and<br>
the precipitating agent, and the reaction condition<br>
used, is normally carried out in the one phase<br>
condition selected from the group consisting of liquid<br>
phase, gas liquid mixed phase, gas liquid solid mixed<br>
phase and solid liquid mixed phase. The reaction<br><br>
temperature, although it may be varied depending on the<br>
kind of the precipitating agent used, is normally -70-<br>
600°C, preferably-30-400°C, more preferably -10-250°C.<br>
The reaction time, although it may be varied<br>
depending on the kind of the precipitating agent and<br>
the reaction temperature, is normally 0.001-100 hour,<br>
preferably 0.1-20 hours. The reaction is usually<br>
carried out under the pressure of 10-107 Pa. This<br>
reaction may be carried out as the batch or continuous<br>
reaction.<br>
In the precipitating reaction, it is the<br>
preferable method to add a substance forming crystal<br>
nuclei. Further, although the metal containing<br>
substance exists as solid on separating this reaction<br>
mixture, it does not necessarily need to exist as solid<br>
while the precipitating reaction is proceeding, and it<br>
may be solidified through the operations such as<br>
cooling or the like after this reaction. In the case<br>
of the aforementioned (II) , the separation of the<br>
reaction mixture is the solid-liquid separation, and<br>
the mixture is separated to a solid phase mainly<br>
consisting of the metal containing substance and a<br>
liquid phase mainly consisting of the product derived<br>
from the high boiling point material. For this solid<br>
liquid separation, normally sedimentation,<br>
centrifugation, filtration or the like separation<br>
method are used.<br>
Further in carrying out the method of (II),<br><br>
the high boiling point material containing in the<br>
liquid may react or may not react in the precipitating<br>
reaction.<br>
In case the method of the aforementioned<br>
(III) is used, the reactive solvent to be used may be<br>
any reactive solvent as long as it reacts with the high<br>
boiling point material and produces compounds with the<br>
boiling point lower than that of the high boiling point<br>
material. For example, water; lower alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol (isomers thereof), butanol<br>
(isomers thereof), or the like; lower carboxylic acids<br>
such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid or the<br>
like; carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate, diethyl<br>
carbonate, dibutyl carbonate or the like may be used.<br>
Water, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, methyl acetate,<br>
ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate,<br>
dibutyl carbonate or the like are preferably used and<br>
more preferably, water is used.<br>
The solvolysis in the present invention means<br>
the reaction between the reactive solvent and the high<br>
boiling point material, and the solvolysis products may<br>
undergo further reactions such as the decarboxylation<br>
reaction that is different from the solvolysis<br>
reaction. This low boiling point product of the<br>
solvolysis may be a product with a lower boiling point<br>
than the high boiling point material and its variety or<br>
structure may be varied depending upon the reactive<br>
solvent and the kind of the high boiling point<br><br>
material. The solvolysis products with low boiling<br>
point are explained particularly in following (i)-<br>
(iii), when the high boiling point material is phenyl<br>
salicylate that is one of aromatic carboxyl compounds.<br>
(i) In the case where the reactive solvent is<br>
water: phenol and salicylic acid are produced by<br>
hydrolysis and this salicylic acid further undergoes<br>
decarboxylation reaction producing phenol and carbon<br>
dioxide.<br>
(ii) In the case where the reactive solvent<br>
is alcohol: alkyl salicylate and phenol are produced by<br>
alcoholysis.<br>
(iii) In the case where the reactive solvent<br>
is calboxylic acid: salicylic acid and phenyl<br>
carboxylate ester are produced by the<br>
transesterification and this salicylic acid further<br>
undergoes decarboxylation reaction converted into<br>
phenol and carbon dioxide.<br>
Above explanation is based on the example of<br>
phenyl salicylate that is relatively simple structured<br>
aromatic carboxylic compound but similar reactions<br>
involving more complexed aromatic carboxylic compounds<br>
may also generate corresponding solvolysis products<br>
such as aromatic monohydroxy compound, ester of lower<br>
carboxylic acid and aromatic mono hydroxyl compound,<br>
ester of aromatic carboxyl compound and a lower<br>
alcohol, carbon dioxide or the like. In particular,<br>
aromatic monohydroxy compounds are preferable as<br><br>
solvolysis products because they are the reactive<br>
substances of the present invention and can be reused.<br>
Since the liquid contains the metal-<br>
containing catalyst which normally functions as a<br>
catalyst for the solvolysis reaction, it is not<br>
necessary to use a catalyst for the solvolysis reaction<br>
in particular. However, the catalyst may be used for<br>
the purpose of improving the rate of reaction or the<br>
like.<br>
The reaction between the high boiling point<br>
material and the reactive solvent is normally carried<br>
out, although it may be varied depending on the<br>
reaction condition, in one phase condition either<br>
liquid phase or solid liquid mixture phase.<br>
The reaction temperature, although it may be<br>
varied depending on the kind of the reactive solvent<br>
used, is normally -30 to 400°C, preferably -10 to 300°C,<br>
more preferably -0 to 250°C.<br>
The reaction time, although it may be varied<br>
depending on the kind of the reactive solvent and the<br>
reaction temperature, normally 0.001-100 hour,<br>
preferably 0.1-20 hours. The reaction is usually<br>
carried out under the pressure of 10-107 Pa. This<br>
reaction may be carried out as the batch or continuous<br>
reaction.<br>
The metal-containing catalyst may or may not<br>
catalyze the solvolysis reaction. In case of reacting<br>
water or alcohols as the reactive solvent to the liquid<br><br>
containing an aromatic carboxylic compound as the high<br>
boiling point material, carbon dioxide is generated as<br>
one of the derivations from the high boiling point<br>
material due to the decarboxylation. Thus this carbon<br>
dioxide acts as the precipitating agent and reacts with<br>
the metal-containing catalyst, and metal containing<br>
substances such as metal carbonate or the like may be<br>
obtained in soluble and/or solidified states.<br>
In the method of the aforementioned (III),<br>
the reaction mixture is separated by distillation, and<br>
the low boiling points solvolysis products that are the<br>
products derived from the high boiling point material<br>
are mainly obtained as distillates. The metal-<br>
containing catalyst remains in the residual liquid in<br>
the distillation still. This distillation separation<br>
is carried out at the temperature normally 10-300°C,<br>
preferably 50-250°C, represented as the temperature of<br>
the liquid in the distillation still. The reaction is<br>
usually carried out under the pressure of 0.1-1.0 x 106<br>
Pa, preferably 1.0-1.0 x 105 Pa. The distillation may<br>
be carried out batch-wise or continuously.<br>
When the products derived from the metal-<br>
containing catalyst, which are obtained by separating<br>
the reaction mixture of the liquid from the active<br>
substance, are to be recycled in the system, the<br>
composition containing the products derived from the<br>
metal-containing catalyst, which are obtained by<br>
separation of the reaction mixture, in liquid, solid or<br><br>
liquid solid mixed phase may be recycled into the<br>
system as they are, or if this composition contains<br>
other components than the products derived from the<br>
metal-containing catalyst, a part or the whole<br>
components may be separated and then recycled in the<br>
system. Further, the reaction solution or slurry,<br>
which is obtained by reacting the products derived from<br>
the metal-containing catalyst to the starting material<br>
or to the reactive substance, may be recycled. This<br>
method is the preferred method when the products<br>
derived from the metal-containing catalyst are in a<br>
solid or a solid liquid mixed phase.<br>
Concerning the high boiling point liquid<br>
materials to be removed from the system, those<br>
concentrations which may be varied depending on the<br>
kind of materials, are not preferred to be kept<br>
extremely low because the volume of the liquid, which<br>
is subjected to the removal, becomes too large. Also,<br>
if the concentration of the high boiling point material<br>
is too high, handling becomes difficult due to the<br>
increase of the boiling point and the viscosity.<br>
Therefore, the concentration of the high boiling point<br>
material in the liquid, which is subjected to the<br>
removal, is normally 0.01-99% by weight, preferably<br>
0.1-95% by weight and more preferably 1-90% by weight.<br>
Further, when the high boiling point material<br>
is an aromatic polyvalent hydroxyl compound, the weight<br>
ratio of aromatic polyvalent hydroxyl compound to the<br><br>
metal of the catalyst in the liquid is normally kept at<br>
2 or below to prevent deposition and attachment of the<br>
catalyst in the reactor and the lines.<br>
By using the metal-containing catalyst of the<br>
present invention, factors that rendered the production<br>
unstable in the past such as clogging of the<br>
distillation column, deposition of the catalyst<br>
component to the wall are surprisingly improved.<br>
Further, the preferred example of the present<br>
invention includes the usage of diaryl carbonate,<br>
purified by the method of the present invention, in<br>
aromatic polycarbonate production by the<br>
transesterification method. Polycarbonate which is<br>
produced by the transesterification method, depending<br>
on the polymerization method, tends to show red<br>
coloring due to the metal content in the catalyst for<br>
diphenyl carbonate which is used as the material,<br>
especially when the Ti content is greater than 1 ppm.<br>
However, the aromatic carbonate, particularly important<br>
diphenyl carbonate, which is produced by the method of<br>
the present invention contains Ti at 1 ppm or below.<br>
Polycarbonate is easily produced by the<br>
transesterification polymerization with bisphenol A.<br>
Thus polycarbonate produce in the present invention is<br>
high quality because it contains less Ti which causes<br>
coloring of polycarbonate.<br>
Further, in producing aromatic polycarbonate<br>
by the transesterification method, the polymerization<br><br>
at high rate may be achieved using the diaryl carbonate<br>
produced by the method of the present invention. Still<br>
further, aromatic polycarbonate produced by the<br>
transesterification method, which is obtained using<br>
aromatic dihydroxy compound and diaryl carbonate<br>
produced by the method of the present invention, has no<br>
coloring and is high quality.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, high<br>
purity diaryl carbonate that is easily separated from a<br>
catalyst is produced, wherein a starting material<br>
selected from the group consisting of a dialkyl<br>
carbonate, an alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture thereof<br>
and a reactive substance selected from the group<br>
consisting of an aromatic monohydroxy compound, an<br>
alkylaryl carbonate and a mixture thereof are reacted<br>
in the presence of a metal-containing catalyst to<br>
produce aromatic carbonates while by-products alcohols<br>
and/or dialkyl carbonates are distilled out of the<br>
system.<br>

Examples<br>
The present invention will be described based<br>
on the examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
[Production of aromatic carbonic acid ester]<br>
Aromatic carbonate was produced using a<br>
device shown in Fig. 1. The reaction was carried out<br>
by supplying continuously at a rate of about 109 g/Hr,<br>
through a preheater 2 and a line 1, a mixed solution<br>
consisting of dibutyl carbonate, phenol and, as the<br>
catalyst, phenyl titanate dimer-2PhOH adduct [(PhO)3-Ti-<br>
0-Ti-(OPh)3-2PhOH] (result of element analysis: C=67.2,<br>
H=4.93, 0=16.77, Ti=11.1; result of 1H-NMR analysis:<br>
PhOH and PhO groups exist at the ratio of 2:6. In one<br>
molecule, two Ti atoms and one oxygen atom that is not<br>
derived from PhOH and PhO groups exist, that is, one<br><br>
Ti-O-Ti bond exists; molecular weight without the<br>
adduct PhOH: 670; vapor pressure: 1 Pa or below at<br>
230°C) (the mixed solution in which that the ratio by<br>
weight of dibutyl carbonate to phenol was adjusted to<br>
about 65/35, and Ti as atoms was adjusted to about<br>
10,000 ppm of the whole liquid) from the middle stage<br>
of a continuous multi-stage distillation column 3,<br>
which was composed of a condensation part, which was 2<br>
inch in the internal diameter, 0.5 m in the column<br>
length and filled with 10 stages of sieve trays, and a<br>
recovery part which was 2 inch in the internal<br>
diameter, 1 m in the column length and filled with<br>
Dixon packing (6 mm(|&gt;) . The condensation part was<br>
disposed in the lower part of the stage where the<br>
mixture was supplied continuously, and the recovery<br>
part was disposed in the upper part. The heat required<br>
for the reaction and distillation was supplied by<br>
circulating the liquid in the lower part of the column<br>
through a line 10 and a reboiler 11, and the<br>
temperature at the bottom of the multi-stage<br>
distillation column was controlled to be about 230°C.<br>
The reaction liquid was continuously removed from the<br>
bottom of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 3 through a line 10 to a storage tank 12 at 90<br>
g/Hr. The catalyst was dissolved in the reaction<br>
liquid.<br>
After the low boiling point liquid mixture<br>
containing 1-butanol as a by-product was removed from<br><br>
the top of the column through a line 4, and then it was<br>
liquefied by a cooler 5, and a part of it was removed<br>
continuously to a storage tank 8 at 19 g/Hr and the<br>
rest was refluxed to the distillation column (reflux<br>
ratio=1.9).<br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 12 was<br>
composed of about 23% by weight of phenol, about 56% by<br>
weight dibutyl carbonate, about 12% by weight of butyl<br>
phenyl carbonate, about 0.2% by weight of diphenyl<br>
carbonate, about 0.3% by weight of 1-butanol and the<br>
catalyst. The liquid removed to the storage tank 8 was<br>
composed of about 99% by weight of 1-butanol, about<br>
0.5% by weight of phenol, and about 0.2% by weight of<br>
dibutyl carbonate.<br>
After the reaction in the continuous multi-<br>
stage distillation column 3, the reaction was carried<br>
out using a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
15. The continuous multi-stage distillation column 15,<br>
as in the case of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 3, was composed of a condensation<br>
part, which is 2 inch in the internal diameter, 0.5 m<br>
in the column length and filled with 10 stages of sieve<br>
trays, and a recovery part which is 2 inch in the<br>
internal diameter, 1 m in the column length and filled<br>
with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ) , and the condensation part<br>
was disposed in the lower part of the stage where the<br>
reaction liquid containing the catalyst was supplied<br>
continuously from the storage tank 12 to this<br><br>
distillation column 15, and the recovery part was<br>
disposed in the upper part.<br>
The reaction was carried out by supplying<br>
continuously through a line 13 the reaction liquid,<br>
which was removed from the bottom of the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 3 through the line 10<br>
to the storage tank 12, to the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 at 100 g/Hr after preheating<br>
with a preheater 14. The heat required for the<br>
reaction and distillation was supplied by circulating<br>
the liquid in the lower part of the column through a<br>
line 22 and a reboiler 24, and the temperature at the<br>
bottom of the multi-stage distillation column is<br>
controlled to be about 220°C.<br>
The reaction liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 through the line 22 to a storage<br>
tank 24 at 17 g/Hr. After the low boiling point liquid<br>
mixture containing dibutylcarbonate as a by-product was<br>
removed from the top of the column through a line 16,<br>
and then it was liquefied by a cooler 17, and a part of<br>
it was removed continuously to a storage tank 20 at 83<br>
g/Hr and the rest was refluxed to the distillation<br>
column (reflux ratio=4).<br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 24 was<br>
composed of about 5% by weight of dibutyl carbonate,<br>
about 74% by weight of butyl phenyl carbonate, about<br>
10% by weight of diphenyl carbonate, and the catalyst.<br><br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 20 was composed<br>
of about 0.3% by weight of 1-butanol, about 18% by-<br>
weight of phenol, and about 81% by weight of dibutyl<br>
carbonate. No deposit or the like were found in the<br>
distillation column on inspection.<br>
[Purification of diaryl carbonate]<br>
Purification of diaryl carbonate was carried<br>
out with a device shown in Fig. 2. The distillation<br>
separation was carried out by continuously feeding the<br>
liquid, which was removed to the storage tank 24,<br>
through a line 25 passing a preheater 26 at about 192<br>
g/Hr to about 0.1 m above the middle stage of a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 27, which<br>
was a column filled with Dixon packing (6 mm<j with an></j>
internal diameter of 2 inch and a length of 1 m.<br>
The heat required for the distillation<br>
separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 34 and a<br>
reboiler 35, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column is controlled to be<br>
about 210°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 27 through the line 34 to the<br>
storage tank 36 at about 90 g/Hr. After removing from<br>
the top of the column through the line 28, the<br>
distillate was liquefied by a cooler 29 and was removed<br>
continuously to a storage tank 33 at about 102 g/Hr.<br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 33 is composed<br><br>
of dibutyl carbonate: about 0.6% by weight, butyl<br>
phenyl carbonate: about 73% by weight, diphenyl<br>
carbonate: about 26% by weight.<br>
The distillation separation was carried out<br>
by continuously feeding the liquid, which was<br>
continuously removed to the storage tank 33, through a<br>
line 37 passing a preheater 38 at about 101 g/Hr to the<br>
middle stage of a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 39, which was a column filled with Dixon packing<br>
(6 mm(j)) with an internal diameter of 2 inch and a length<br>
of 2 m. The heat required for the distillation<br>
separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 4 6 and a<br>
reboiler 47, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 200°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 39 through the line 46 to a storage<br>
tank 48 at about 19 g/Hr.<br>
After removing from the top of the column<br>
through a line 40, the distillate was liquefied by a<br>
cooler 41 and was removed continuously to a storage<br>
tank 4 4 at about 82 g/Hr. The liquid removed to the<br>
storage tank 44 is composed of dibutyl carbonate: about<br>
0.7% by weight, butyl phenyl carbonate: about 90% by<br>
weight, diphenyl carbonate: about 9% by weight.<br>
White liquid that was solidified at ambient<br>
temperature was continuously removed to a storage tank<br><br>
48 and contained diphenyl carbonate: about 100% by<br>
weight, and butyl phenyl carbonate was below the<br>
detection limit. The analysis of the liquid indicated<br>
that Ti was below the detection limit. Inspection of<br>
the distillation column revealed not deposit or the<br>
like.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
[Production of aromatic carbonate]<br>
Aromatic carbonate was produced in the device<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The reaction was carried out by<br>
supplying continuously at a rate of about 109 g/Hr,<br>
through a preheater 2 and a transport line 1, a mixed<br>
solution consisting of dibutyl carbonate, phenol, and<br>
phenyl titanate [Ti(OPh)4] (this phenyl titanate: adduct<br>
with phenol; molecular weight without the adduct<br>
phenol: 420; vapor pressure: about 15 Pa at 230°C) (the<br>
mixed solution in which the ratio by weight of dibutyl<br>
carbonate to phenol was adjusted to about 65/35, and Ti<br>
as atoms was adjusted to about 10,000 ppm of the whole<br>
liquid) from the middle stage of a continuous multi-<br>
stage distillation column 3, which is composed of a<br>
condensation part, which is 2 inch in the internal<br>
diameter, 0.5 m in the column length and filled with 10<br>
stages of sieve trays, and a recovery part which is 2<br>
inch in the internal diameter, 1 m in the column length<br>
and filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ). The condensation<br>
part was disposed in the lower part of the stage where<br>
the mixture was supplied continuously, and the recovery<br><br>
part was disposed in the upper part.<br>
The heat required for the reaction and<br>
distillation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 10 and a<br>
reboiler 11, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column is controlled to be<br>
about 230°C. The reaction liquid was continuously<br>
removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 3 through the line 10 to a storage<br>
tank 12 at 90 g/Hr.<br>
After the low boiling point liquid mixture<br>
containing 1-butanol as a by-product was removed from<br>
the top of the column through a line 4, and then it was<br>
liquefied by the cooler 5, and a part of it was removed<br>
continuously to a storage tank 8 at 19 g/Hr and the<br>
rest was refluxed to the distillation column (reflux<br>
ratio=1.9). The liquid removed to the storage tank 12<br>
was composed of: phenol: about 23% by weight, dibutyl<br>
carbonate: about 56% by weight, butyl phenyl carbonate:<br>
about 12% by weight, diphenyl carbonate: about 0.2% by<br>
weight, 1-butanol: about 0.3% by weight. The liquid<br>
removed to the storage tank 8 was composed of 1-<br>
butanol: about 99% by weight, phenol: about 0.5% by<br>
weight, and dibutyl carbonate: about 0.2% by weight.<br>
After the reaction in the continuous multi-<br>
stage distillation column 3, the reaction was carried<br>
out using a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
15. The continuous multi-stage distillation column 15,<br><br>
like the continuous multi-stage distillation column 3,<br>
is composed of a condensation part, which is 2 inch in<br>
the internal diameter, 0.5 m in the column length and<br>
filled with 10 stages of sieve trays, and a recovery-<br>
part which is 2 inch in the internal diameter, 1 m in<br>
the column length and filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ),<br>
and the condensation part was disposed in the lower<br>
part of the stage where the reaction liquid containing<br>
the catalyst was supplied continuously from the storage<br>
tank 12 to this distillation column 15, and the<br>
recovery part was disposed in the upper part.<br>
The reaction was carried out by supplying<br>
continuously through a line 13 the reaction liquid,<br>
which was removed from the bottom of the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 3 through the line 10<br>
to the storage tank 12, to the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 at 100 g/Hr after preheating<br>
with a preheater 14. The heat required for the<br>
reaction and distillation was supplied by circulating<br>
the liquid in the lower part of the column through a<br>
line 22 and a reboiler 24, and the temperature at the<br>
bottom of the multi-stage distillation column is<br>
controlled to be about 220°C.<br>
The reaction liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 through the line 22 to a storage<br>
tank 24 at 17 g/Hr. After the low boiling point liquid<br>
mixture containing dibutylcarbonate as a by-product was<br><br>
removed from the top of the column through a line 16,<br>
and then it was liquefied by a cooler 17, and a part of<br>
it was removed continuously to a storage tank 20 at 83<br>
g/Hr and the rest was refluxed to the distillation<br>
column (reflux ratio=4).<br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 24 was<br>
composed of dibutyl carbonate : about 5% by weight,<br>
butyl phenyl carbonate: about 74% by weight, diphenyl<br>

Example 7<br>
(Preparation of the catalyst)<br>
To a reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a<br>
heating and cooling device and a reflux condenser, 3400g (10 mol) of tetra-n-<br>
butoxytitanium and 1700 g of n-butanol were added and the liquid was<br>
cooled to a temperature of 0° C while being mixed well. While maintaining<br>
the liquid temperature at 0° C, a , mixture of 90 g (5 mol) of water and 2000 g<br>
of n-butanol was added for 1 hour. After the addition the temperature was<br>
raised to 80° C and stirred for 5 hours. The flask was connected to a rotary<br>
evaporator equipped with a vacuum controller, vacuum pump and oil bath<br>
for heating after cooling down the liquid to room temperature (about 20° C).<br>
The low boiling point components were distilled by reducing the pressure to<br>
about 25k Pa while maintaining the liquid temperature at 80° C. When<br>
almost all the distillates came out, the temperature was raised slowly to 23° C<br>
and further the pressure was reduced to 1 Pa, and after confirming that were<br>
no	distillate, nitrogen was added to return to normal<br>
pressure and the	temperature	was returned to room<br>
temperature (about 20° C) to obtain<br><br>
about 2750 g of a pale yellow viscous liquid. This<br>
liquid is a catalyst A. The result of element analysis<br>
showed that the composition is C: 52.3%, H; 9.9%, 0:<br>

was a column filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ) with an<br>
internal diameter of 2 inch and a length of 2 m.<br>
The heat required for the distillation<br>
separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 4 6 and a<br>
reboiler 47, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 230°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br><br>
distillation column 39 through the line 46 to a storage tank 48 at about 8<br>
g/Hr. After removing from the top of the column through a line 40, the<br>
distillate was liquefied by a cooler 41 and was removed continuously to a<br>
storage tank 44 at about 92 g/Hr. The liquid removed to the storage tank 44<br>
is composed of dibutyl carbonate: about 6% by weight, butyl phenyl<br>
carbonate: about 94% by weight. White liquid that was solidified at ambient<br>
temperature was continuously removed to a storage tank 48 and contained<br>
diphenyl carbonate: about 100% by weight, and butyl phenyl carbonate was<br>
below the detection limit. The analysis of the liquid indicated that Ti content<br>
was below the detection limit. No deposit or the like were found in the<br>
distillation column on inspection.<br>
Example 8<br>
(Preparation of the catalyst)<br>
To a reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a<br>
heating and cooling device and a reflux condenser, 3400g (10 mol) of tetra-n-<br>
butoxytitanium and 1700 g of n-butanol were added and the liquid was<br>
cooled to a temperature of 0°C while being mixed well. While maintaining<br>
the liquid temperature at 0oC, a mixture of 216 g (12 mol) of water and 2000 g<br>
of n-butanol was added slowly for 1 hour. After the addition the<br>
temperature was raised to 80° C and stirred for 5 hours. The<br>
flask was connected to a rotary evaporated with a vacuum controller,<br><br>
vacuum pump and oil bath for heating after cooling down<br>
the liquid to room temperature (about 20°C). The low<br>
boiling point components were distilled by reducing the<br>
pressure to about 25K Pa while maintaining the liquid<br>
temperature at 80°C. When almost all the distillates<br>
came out, the temperature was raised slowly to 230°C and<br>
further the pressure was reduced to 1 Pa, and after<br>
confirming that there were no distillate, nitrogen was<br>
added to return to normal pressure and the temperature<br>
was returned to room temperature (about 20°C) to obtain<br>
about 2320 g of pale yellow viscous liquid. This<br>
liquid is a catalyst B. The result of element analysis<br>
showed that the composition is C: 48.3%, H; 9.1%, O:<br>
21.9%, Ti: 20.7%, and the number of bridging oxygen<br>
atoms was 5 since the oxygen atom derived from BuO was<br>
16.1, and there were 5 Ti-O-Ti bonds. The molecular<br>
weight was 1390 and the vapor pressure was 1 Pa or less<br>
at 230°C. Thus the catalyst B described above is<br>
presumed to be a mixture containing butyl titanate<br>
hexamer [(BuO)3-Ti-O-(Ti(OBu)2-O)4-Ti-(OBu)3] as a main<br>
component.<br>
[Production of aromatic carbonic acid ester]<br>
Aromatic carbonate was produced using a<br>
device shown in Fig. 1. The reaction was carried out<br>
by supplying continuously at a rate of about 109 g/Hr,<br>
through a preheater 2 and a line 1, a mixed solution<br>
consisting of dibutyl carbonate, phenol and, as a<br>
catalyst, the catalyst B (in which the ratio by weight<br><br>
of dibutyl carbonate to phenol was adjusted to about<br>
65/35, and Ti as atoms was adjusted to about 10,000 ppm<br>
of the whole liquid, and this catalyst was dissolved in<br>
this solution) from the middle stage of a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 3, which was composed<br>
of a condensation part, which was 2 inch in the<br>
internal diameter, 0.5 m in the column length and<br>
filled with 10 stages of sieve trays, and a recovery<br>
part which was 2 inch in the internal diameter, 1 m in<br>
the column length and filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ).<br>
The condensation part was disposed in the<br>
lower part of the stage where the mixture was supplied<br>
continuously, and the recovery part was disposed in the<br>
upper part. The heat required for the reaction and<br>
distillation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 10 and a<br>
reboiler 11, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 230°C. The reaction liquid was continuously<br>
removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 3 through the line 10 to a storage<br>
tank 12 at 90 g/Hr. The catalyst was dissolved in the<br>
reaction liquid. After the low boiling point liquid<br>
mixture containing 1-butanol as a by-product was<br>
removed from the top of the column through a line 4,<br>
and then it was liquefied by the cooler 5, and a part<br>
of it was removed continuously to a storage tank 8 at<br>
19 g/Hr and the rest was refluxed to the distillation<br><br>
column (reflux ratio=1.9).<br>
The liquid removed to the storage tank 12 was<br>
composed of phenol: about 23% by weight, dibutyl<br>
carbonate: about 56% by weight, butyl phenyl carbonate:<br>
about 12% by weight, diphenyl carbonate: about 0.2% by<br>
weight, 1-butanol: about 0.3% by weight and also the<br>
catalyst. The liquid removed to the storage tank 8 was<br>
composed of 1-butanol: about 99% by weight, phenol:<br>
about 0.5% by weight, and dibutyl carbonate: about 0.2%<br>
by weight.<br>
After the reaction in the continuous multi-<br>
stage distillation column 3, the reaction was carried<br>
out using a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
15. The continuous multi-stage distillation column 15,<br>
like the continuous multi-stage distillation column 3,<br>
was composed of a condensation part, which is 2 inch in<br>
the internal diameter, 0.5 m in the column length and<br>
filled with 10 stages of sieve trays, and a recovery<br>
part which is 2 inch in the internal diameter, 1 m in<br>
the column length and filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ),<br>
and the condensation part was disposed in the lower<br>
part of the stage where the reaction liquid containing<br>
the catalyst was supplied continuously from the storage<br>
tank 12 to this distillation column 15, and the<br>
recovery part was disposed in the upper part. The<br>
reaction was carried out by supplying continuously<br>
through a line 13 the reaction liquid, which was<br>
removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br><br>
distillation column 3 through the line 10 to the<br>
storage tank 12, to the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 at 100 g/Hr after preheating<br>
with a preheater 14.<br>
The heat required for the reaction and<br>
distillation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 22 and a<br>
reboiler 24, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 220°C. The reaction liquid was continuously<br>
removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 15 through the line 22 to a storage<br>
tank 24 at 17 g/Hr. After the low boiling point liquid<br>
mixture containing dibutylcarbonate as a by-product was<br>
removed from the top of the column through a line 16,<br>
and then it was liquefied by a cooler 17, and a part of<br>
it was removed continuously to a storage tank 20 at 83<br>
g/Hr and the rest was refluxed to the distillation<br>
column (reflux ratio=4). The liquid removed to the<br>
storage tank 24 was composed of dibutyl carbonate:<br>
about 5% by weight, butyl phenyl carbonate: about 74%<br>
by weight, diphenyl carbonate: about 10% by weight and<br>
the catalyst. The liquid removed to the storage tank<br>
20 was composed of 1-butanol: about 0.3% by weight,<br>
phenol: about 18% by weight, and dibutyl carbonate:<br>
about 81% by weight. No deposit or the like were found<br>
in the distillation column on inspection.<br>
[Purification of diaryl carbonate]<br><br>
Purification of diaryl carbonate was carried<br>
out with the device shown in Fig. 2. The distillation<br>
separation was carried out by continuously feeding the<br>
liquid, which was removed to the storage tank 24,<br>
through a line 25 passing a preheater 26 at about 100<br>
g/Hr to about 0.1 m above the middle stage of a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 27, which<br>
was a column filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ) with an<br>
internal diameter of 2 inch and a length of 1 m. The<br>
heat required for the distillation separation was<br>
supplied by circulating the liquid in the lower part of<br>
the column through a line 34 and a reboiler 35, and the<br>
temperature at the bottom of the multi-stage<br>
distillation column is controlled to be about 210°C.<br>
The bottom liquid was continuously removed from the<br>
bottom of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 27 through the line 34 to the storage tank 36 at<br>
about 20 g/Hr.<br>
After removing from the top of the column<br>
through the line 28, the distillate was liquefied by a<br>
cooler 29 and was removed continuously to a storage<br>
tank 33 at about 80 g/Hr. The liquid removed to the<br>
storage tank 33 is composed of dibutyl carbonate: about<br>
6% by weight, butyl phenyl carbonate: about 86% by<br>
weight, diphenyl carbonate: about 7.5% by weight. The<br>
distillation separation was carried out by continuously<br>
feeding the liquid, which was continuously removed to<br>
the storage tank 33, through a line 37 passing a<br><br>
preheater 38 at about 100 g/Hr to the middle stage of a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 39, which was a column<br>
filled with Dixon packing (6 mm0) with an internal diameter of<br>
2 inch and a length of 2 m:<br>
The heat required for the distillation separation was supplied by<br>
circulating the liquid in the lower part of the column through a line 46 and a<br>
reboiler 47, and the temperature at the bottom of the multi-stage distillation<br>
column was controlled to be about 230° C. The bottom liquid was<br>
continuously removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 39 through the line 46 to a storage tank 48 at about 8<br>
g/Hr. After removing from the top of the column through a line 40, the<br>
distillate was liquefied by a cooler 41 and was removed continuously to the<br>
storage tank 44 at about 92 g/Hr. The liquid removed to the storage tank 44<br>
is composed of dibutyl carbonate: about 6% by weight, butyl phenyl<br>
carbonate: about 94% by weight. White liquid that was solidified at ambient<br>
temperature was continuously removed to a storage tank 48 and contained<br>
diphenyl carbonate: about 100% by weight, and butyl phenyl carbonate was<br>
below the detection limit. The analysis of the liquid indicated that Ti content<br>
was below the detection limit. No deposit or the like were found in the<br>
distillation column on inspection.<br>
Example 9<br>
(Preparation of the catalyst)<br><br>
To a reaction flask equipped with a stirrer,<br>
a thermometer, a heating and cooling device and a<br>
reflux condenser, 3400g (10 mol) of tetra-n-<br>
butoxytitanium and 1700 g of n-butanol were added and<br>
the liquid was cooled to a temperature of 0°C while<br>
being mixed well. While maintaining the liquid<br>
temperature at 0°C, a mixture of 90 g (5 mol) of water<br>
and 2000 g of n-butanol was added slowly for 1 hour.<br>
After the addition the temperature was raised to 80°C<br>
and stirred for 5 hours. The flask was connected to a<br>
rotary evaporator equipped with a vacuum controller,<br>
vacuum pump and oil bath for heating after cooling down<br>
the liquid to room temperature (about 20°C). The low<br>
boiling point components were distilled by reducing the<br>
pressure to about 25K Pa while maintaining the liquid<br>
temperature at 80°C. When almost all the distillates<br>
came out, the temperature was raised slowly to 230°C and<br>
further the pressure was reduced to 1 Pa, and after<br>
confirming that there were no distillate, nitrogen was<br>
added to return to normal pressure and the temperature<br>
was returned to room temperature (about 20°C) to obtain<br>
about 2750 g of pale yellow viscous liquid. This<br>
liquid is a catalyst A. The result of element analysis<br>
showed that the composition is C: 52.3%, H; 9.9%, 0:<br>
20.4%, Ti: 17.4%, and there is one Ti-O-Ti bond since<br>
the number of oxygen atoms except for the oxygen<br>
derived from BuO was 1 against Ti atom 2. Thus the<br>
catalyst A described above is presumed to be a mixture<br><br>
containing butyl titanate dimer [(BuO)3-Ti-O-Ti (OBu)3]<br>
as a main component.<br>
To this flask, the stirrer, thermometer,<br>
heating and cooling device and reflux condenser were<br>
reattached and the liquid was heated to 80°C while<br>
stirring. While keeping the liquid temperature at 80°C,<br>
4700 g (50 mol) of distilled and dehydrated phenol was<br>
added slowly. After the addition, the liquid was<br>
heated to 180°C and low boiling point components were<br>
evaporated. When there was almost no distillate, the<br>
temperature of the liquid was slowly raised to 230°C to<br>
remove distillates further. The flask was connected to<br>
the vacuum controller and vacuum pump, the pressure was<br>
reduced slowly to 1 Pa and distillates were removed.<br>
Then the flask was taken out of the oil bath, cooled to<br>
room temperature (about 20°C.) and the inside pressure of<br>
the flask was returned to normal by nitrogen. Solid<br>
substance of about 4300 g with red orange coloring was<br>
obtained. This was the catalyst C. The result of<br>
element analysis showed that the composition is C:<br>
64.5%, H: 4.5%, 0: 16.7%, Ti: 14.3%. The catalyst C<br>
described above is presumed to be a mixture containing<br>
phenol adduct of phenyl titanate dimer [(PhO)3-Ti-O-<br>
Ti(OPh)3.2PhOH] as a main component.<br>
[Production of aromatic carbonic acid ester]<br>
A mixture consisting of dimethyl carbonate,<br>
phenol and, as a catalyst, the catalyst C was<br>
continuously supplied as a liquid from an inlet line 50<br><br>
through a preheater 51 to the location at 1 m from the<br>
top of a multi-stage distillation column 49 as shown in<br>
Fig. 3, which was composed of a packed column with 4 m<br>
tall and 3 inch internal diameter filled with Dixon<br>
packing (6 mm<j made of stainless steel. the heat></j>
required for the reaction and distillation was supplied<br>
by heating the liquid in the bottom of the column by<br>
the reboiler (the liquid supply from the inlet line 50:<br>
3.4 kg/Hr; composition of the liquid supply: DMC=about<br>
68.3% by weight, PhOH=about 33.7% by weight, catalyst<br>
C=13.5 mmol/Kg). The temperature at the bottom of the<br>
column was about 201°C, the pressure at the top of the<br>
column was about 800 KPa, the reflux ratio was about 1.<br>
As the result of the reaction, the liquid containing<br>
the component of the catalyst, and methyl phenyl<br>
carbonate and diphenyl carbonate, which were the<br>
reaction products, was obtained from the bottom 53 of<br>
the column through lines 58 and 60. The gas distillate<br>
from a line 54 disposed on the top 52 of the column was<br>
condensed by a condenser 55. A part of the condensed<br>
liquid was refluxed to a distillation column 49 through<br>
an inlet line 56, and the rest was removed from a line<br>
57. From this condensed liquid a low boiling point<br>
product, methanol, was obtained. The amount of liquid<br>
removed from the line 60 (average liquid composition:<br>
methyl phenyl carbonate=50 g/Kg.Hr, diphenyl<br>
carbonate=0.4 g/Kg/Hr) was about 2.3 Kg/Hr. No deposit<br>
or the like were found in the distillation column on<br><br>
inspection.<br>
[Purification of aromatic carbonate]<br>
Aromatic carbonate was purified using a<br>
device shown in Fig. 2. The device was a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column which was composed of a<br>
column with 2 inch internal diameter and 1 m height,<br>
filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ). Distillation<br>
separation was carried out by feeding the liquid<br>
removed from the aforementioned line 60, continuously<br>
at a rate of about 100 g/Hr, through a line 25 and a<br>
preheater 26, to a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 27 at the location about 0.1 m above the middle<br>
stage. The heat required for the distillation<br>
separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 34 and a<br>
reboiler 35, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 210°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 27 through the line 34 to the<br>
storage tank 36. After removing from the top of the<br>
column through a line 28, the distillate was liquefied<br>
by a cooler 29 and was removed continuously to a<br>
storage tank 33. Distillation separation was carried<br>
out by feeding the liquid, which was removed<br>
continuously from the storage tank 33, continuously at<br>
a rate of about 100 g/Hr, through a line 37 and the<br>
preheater 38, to the middle stage of a continuous<br><br>
multi-stage distillation column 39, which was composed of a column with 2<br>
inch internal diameter and 2 m height, filled with Dixon packing (6 mm*).<br>
The heat required for the distillation separation was supplied by circulating<br>
the liquid in the lower part of the column through a line 46 and a reboiler 47,<br>
and the temperature at the bottom of the multi-stage distillation column was<br>
controlled to be about 230°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage distillation column 39 through<br>
a line 46 to a storage tank 48. After being removed from the top of the<br>
column through a line 40, the distillated was liquefied by a cooler 41 and was<br>
removed continuously to a storage tank 44. The liquid removed to the<br>
storage tank 44 contained methyl phenyl carbonate at about 94% by weight.<br>
The analysis of the liquid indicated that Ti content was below the detection<br>
limit. No deposit or the like were found in the distillation column on<br>
inspection.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
Aromatic carbonate was purified as in Example 9 except that the<br>
catalyst was changed from the catalyst C to phenoxy titanate [Ti (OPh)4]<br>
(molecular weight: 420, vapor pressure: about 15 Pa at 23°C ). The amount<br>
of the liquid (average composition: methyl phenyl earbonate=50<br>
g/Kg.Hr, diphenyl carbonate=0.4 g/Kg/Hr) removed from the line 60 was<br>
about 2.3 Kg/Hr. The liquid removed to the storage tank 44 contained<br><br>
methyl phenyl carbonate : about 94% by weight. The analysis of the liquid<br>
indicated that Ti was detected at 9 ppm. Inspection of the inside of the<br>
column revealed white deposits on the wall of the distillation column and the<br>
packing.<br>
Example 10<br>
(Preparation of the catalyst)<br>
To a reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a<br>
heating and cooling device and a reflux condenser, 3400g (10 mol) of tetra-n-<br>
butoxytitanium and 1700 g of n-butahol were added and the liquid was<br>
cooled to a temperature of 0°C while being mixed well. While maintaining<br>
the liquid temperature at 0°C, a mixture of 90 g (5 mol) of water and 2000 g of<br>
n-butanol was added slowly for 1 hour. After the additional, the temperature<br>
was raised to 80oC and stirred for 5 hours. The flask was connected to a<br>
rotary evaporator equipped with a vacuum controller, vacuum pump and oil<br>
bath for heating after cooling down the liquid to room temperature (about<br>
20o C). The low boiling point components were distilled by reducing the<br>
pressure to about 25 Kpa while maintaining the liquid temperature at 80o C.<br>
When almost all the distillates came out, the temperature was raised slowly to<br>
230o C and the pressure was reduced further to 1 Pa, and after<br>
confirming that there were no distillate, nitrogen was added<br>
to return to normal pressure and the temperature was returned<br>
to room temperature (about 20o C) to obtain<br><br>
about 2750 g of pale yellow viscous liquid. This<br>

as a main component.<br>
To this flask, the stirrer, thermometer,<br>

reattached and the liquid was heated to 80°C while being<br>
stirred. While keeping the liquid temperature at 80°C,<br>
4700 g (50 mol) of distilled and dehydrated phenol was<br>
added slowly. After the addition, the liquid was<br>
heated to 180°C and low boiling point components were<br>
evaporated. When there was almost no distillate, the<br>
temperature of the liquid was slowly raised to 230°C to<br>
further remove distillates. The flask was connected to<br>
the vacuum controller and vacuum pump, the pressure was<br>
reduced slowly to 1 Pa and distillates were removed.<br>
Then the flask was taken out of the oil bath, cooled to<br>
room temperature (about 20°C) and the inside pressure of<br>
the flask was returned to normal by nitrogen. Solid<br>
substance of about 4300 g with red orange coloring was<br>
obtained. This was the catalyst C. The result of<br>

Ti(OPh)3-2PhOH] as a main component.<br>
[Production of aromatic carbonic acid ester]<br>
A mixture consisting of methyl phenyl<br>
carbonate (MPC) and the catalyst was continuously<br>
supplied as a liquid from an inlet line 62 through a<br>
preheater 63 to the location at 1 m from the top of a<br>
multi-stage distillation column 61 as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
which was composed of a pressure control device 68 and<br>
a packed column with 4 m tall and 3 inch internal<br>
diameter packed with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ) made of<br>
stainless steel, and the reaction was carried out by<br>
heating with the reboiler (the liquid supply from the<br>
inlet line 62: 4.2 Kg/Hr; composition of the liquid<br>
supply: MPC=about 99% by weight, catalyst C=12.5<br>
mmol/Kg). The temperature at the bottom of the column<br>
was about 195°C, the pressure at the top of the column<br>
was about 30 KPa, the reflux ratio was about 2.1. As<br>
the result of the reaction, the liquid containing<br>
diphenyl carbonate, which was the reaction product, was<br>
obtained from the bottom 65 of the continuous multi-<br>
stage distillation column through the outlet 70 of the<br>
column bottom liquid. The gas distillate from a gas<br>
outlet 66 disposed on the top 64 of the column was<br>
condensed by a condenser 67. A part of the condensed<br>
liquid was refluxed, and the rest was removed from an<br>
outlet 69 of the condensed liquid. From this condensed<br><br>
liquid a by-product, dimethyl carbonate, was obtained.<br>
From the liquid removed from the line 70, diphenyl<br>
carbonate was obtained at a rate of 705 g/Kg/Hr. No<br>
deposit or the like were found in the distillation<br>
column on inspection.<br>
[Purification of aromatic carbonate]<br>
Aromatic carbonate was purified using a<br>
device shown in Fig. 2. The device was a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column which was composed of a<br>
column with 2 inch internal diameter and 1 m tall,<br>
filled with Dixon packing (6 mmϕ) . Distillation<br>
separation was carried out by feeding the liquid<br>
removed from the aforementioned line 60, continuously<br>
at a rate of about 100 g/Hr, through a line 25 and a<br>
preheater 26, to a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 27 at the location about 0.1 m above the middle<br>
stage. The heat required for the distillation<br>
separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in<br>
the lower part of the column through a line 34 and a<br>
reboiler 35, and the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column was controlled to be<br>
about 210°C. The bottom liquid was continuously removed<br>
from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 27 through the line 34 to a storage<br>
tank 36. After removing from the top of the column<br>
through the line 28, the distillate was liquefied by a<br>
cooler 2 9 and was removed continuously to a storage<br>
tank 33. Distillation separation was carried out by<br><br>
feeding the liquid, which was removed continuously from the storage tank<br>
33, continuously at a rate of about 100 g/Hr, through a line 37 and a<br>
preheater 38, to the middle stage of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column with 2 inch internal diameter and 2 m height, filled with Dixon<br>
packing (6 mmϕ), The heat required for the distillation separation was<br>
supplied by circulating the liquid in the lower part of the column through a<br>
line 46 and a reboiler 47, and the temperature at the bottom of the multi-stage<br>
distillation column was controlled to be about 230o C. The bottom liquid was<br>
continuously removed from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 39 through the line 46 to a storage tank 48. After being<br>
removed from the top of the column through the line 40, the distillate was<br>
liquefied by a cooler 41and was removed continuously to a storage tank 44.<br>
To a storage tank 48, white liquid which was solidified at ambient<br>
temperature was continuously removed and this was diphenyl carbonate,<br>
about 100% by weight. The analysis of the liquid indicated that Ti content<br>
was below the detection limit. No deposit or the like were found in the<br>
distillation column on inspection.<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
Aromatic carbonate was purified as in Example 10 except that the catalyst<br>
was changed from the catalyst C to phenol adduct of phenoxy titanate<br><br>
[Ti (OPh)4 2PhOH] (molecular weight without phenol adduct: 420, vapor<br>
pressure: about 15 Pa at 230°C) (the liquid supplied from the inlet line 62: 4.2<br>
Kg/Hr; composition of the liquid supplied: MPC=about 99 wt , %, catalyst<br>
C=12.5 mmol/Kg). The temperature at the bottom of the column was about<br>
195°C, the pressure at the top of the column was about 30 KPa, and the reflux<br>
ration was about 2.1, To the storage tank 48, white liquid which was<br>
solidified at ambient temperature was continuously removed and this was<br>
diphenyl carbonate, about 100% by weight. The analysis of the liquid<br>
indicated that Ti was detected at 5 ppm. Inspection of the inside of the<br>
column revealed white deposits on the wall of the distillation column and the<br>
packing.<br>
Example 11 (Polycarbonate was obtained from diphenyl carbonate produced<br>
by the method for production in<br>
Example 1)<br>
Diphenyl carbonate obtained in Example 1: 23.5 g and bisphenol A:<br>
22.8 g were put in a vacuum reactor equipped with a stirrer and polymerized<br>
at 8000 Pa for 30 minutes and 4000 Pa for 90 minutes while being purged with<br>
nitrogen gas. After this, temperature was raised to 270oC and polymerization<br>
was continued at 70 Pa for 1 hour. Aromatic polycarbonate obtained in such<br>
a way was transparent without weight was 10,500.<br>
Comparative Example 7 (Polycarbonate was obtained from<br><br>
diphenyl carbonate produced by the method for production in Comparative<br>
Example 1)<br>
Diphenyl carbonate obtained in Example 2: 23.5 g and<br>
bisphenol A: 22.8 g were put in a vacuum reactor equipped with a stirrer and<br>
polymerized at 8000 Pa for 30 minutes and 4000 Pa for 90 minutes while<br>
being purged with nitrogen gas. After this, temperature was raised to 270oC<br>
and polymerization was continued at 70 Pa for 1 hour. Aromatic<br>
polycarbonate obtained in such a way had red coloring and the number<br>
