ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention is concerned with stable pharmaceutical formulation of tablet comprising an effective amount of S (-) amlodipine besilate salt with pharmaceutically acceptable &amp; compatible (physical &amp; chemical) excipients. S (-) amlodipine besilate find utility as anti-ischaemic and anti-hypertensive activity and formulation having combination with group consisting of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II inhibitor, a calcium inhibitor, beta -adrenergic antagonists.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amlodipine is calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.<br>
Amlodipine is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,909. With regard to the enantiomers of amlodipine, the individual enantiomers of amlodipine have been identified as R (+) and S(-) (J. Med. Chem. 35, 3341-3344 (1992), Goldmann et al). The separation<br><br>
Page 3 of 7<br>
and analysis of enantiomers are well described on "Hand book of HPLC" and the isolation of these are disclosed in Arrowsmith et al. J. Med. Chem., 29: 1696-1702 (1986). Further, European Patent Application No.0331315 disclosed the use of cinchonidine salts of acid for the resolution of intermediates to eventually give enantiomerically pure amiodipine isomers.<br>
Amiodipine    is    chemically    described    as    (RS)    3-ethyl-5-methyl-2-    (2-aminoethoxymethyl)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5 pyridinedicarboxylate.   (U.S.   Pat.   No.   4,572,909)   Its   empirical   formula   is: C2OH25CIN2O5. Amiodipine is a dihydropyridine with an asymmetric centre at the 4-position. The symbol "*" denotes the chiral carbon.<br><br>
The present commercial formulation of amiodipine disclosed contains the drug as the salt of racemic mixture of amiodipine besilate. The term "amiodipine" herein refers to amiodipine &amp; its pharmaceutically suitable salts and esters including amiodipine besilate. The terms "S (-) amiodipine" and "S (-) isomer of amiodipine" as used further in this patent application includes substantially optically pure salt of S (-) isomer of amiodipine besilate.<br><br>
Page 4 of 7<br>
The S (-) amiodipine besilate is useful for the treatment of angina and it is an effective antihypertensive agent for both systolic and diastolic hypertension, particularly in mild to moderate disease and such other conditions as may be related to the activity as a calcium channel antagonist without the concomitant liability of adverse effects which includes edema of extremities, headache and dizziness associated with the administration racemic mixture of amiodipine (U S Pat No. 6,057,344)<br>
The angiotensin converting enzyme blocks conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The principal pharmacological and clinical effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors arise from suppression of synthesis of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance and, therefore, blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis, especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensin II related. ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are clinically useful for the treatment of hypertension in humans. The angiotensin II inhibitor use in our invention is losartan potassium, and Candesartan.<br>
US. Patent 5,098,910 discloses pharmaceutical compositions containing a combination of angiotensin II antagonist (Ramipril, trandolapril, quinapril) and a calcium channel blocker (felodipine) for use in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The publication states that the particular compositions can further contain antihypertensives and/or diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor use in our invention is Ramipril and Quinapril Hydrochloride.<br><br>
Page 5 of 7<br>
Beta adrenergic blocking agents in the combination with the calcium channel blocker have an additive effect in treatment of hypertension, (Am J Cardiol, 81(2): 128-132 (1998) Dunselman P. H. et al). The beta-adrenergic receptor blockers use in our invention is Atenolol.<br>
Amiodipine besilate is patented in U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,303 and it discloses the formulation of amiodipine besilate, this patent is basically for the besilate salt of amiodipine, and it doesn't claim for formulation of the pure S (-) enantiomer of Amiodipine besilate.<br>
Novalitv<br>
Since there is no disclosure of the pharmaceutically stable formulations composition of tablet of optically pure S (-) enantiomer of amiodipine besilate to a human, which is having better pharmacological property then the amiodipine besilate without the concomitant liability of adverse effects which includes edema of extremities, headache and dizziness associated with the administration racemic mixture of amiodipine (U S Pat No. 6,057,344). Our invention provides a pharmaceutically stable tablet formulations comprising of the besilate salt of S (-) amiodipine together with a pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible diluent or a carrier which includes the developmental pharmaceutics studies with proper compatibility (physical &amp; Chemical) studies as per ICH guidelines providing stable formulation composition of tablet with the drug and the excipients.<br><br>
Page 6 of 7<br>
The present invention provides the stable formulation for the S (-) amiodipine besilate in which has the excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, lake of quinoline yellow, colloidal Silicon dioxide, sodium starch glycolate and magnesium stearate, however formulations in example 1,2,3 are physically and chemically stable as per the stability studies in ICH conditions. With lower dose tablets the need for good compressibility and uniform distribution of active drug is crucial and critical factor and selection of proper and suitable excipients and process is very essential microcrystalline cellulose is a commonly used compression aid and wacking agent. The dibasic calcium phosphate gives stability to the S (-) amiodipine. Disintegrants helps in breakup of tablet after the administration, as the active material must be released from the tablet matrix as efficiently as possible to allow rapid dissolution and availability of the drug through formulation to the body system, sodium starch glycolate is used here as disintegrant. Colloidal silicon dioxide helps in increasing the flow property of the granules and has a excellent glidant properties. The adhesion of the drug to the punches of the tablet machine must be avoided. When drug accumulates on the punch surfaces this causes the tablet surface to become pitted and therefore unacceptable. Also sticking of the drug in this way results in high ejection forces when removing the tablet from the machine. In practice it is possible to reduce sticking by wet-massing, careful selection of excipients and the use of high levels of anti-adherents, e.g. magnesium stearate. Thus our process offers the best stability of drug with respect to besilate salt of S-isomer of amiodipine and a convenient process for making a tablet dosage form which is fast, economical and having minimum exposure time to the environment, and a process formulae which can be run on high speed tableting machine having the good desired tablet properties both physical as well as chemical.<br><br>

The invention further relates to a stable combination comprising of S (-) Amiodipine besilate with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, Atenolol, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, Quinapril Hydrochloride the angiotensin II inhibitor as losartan potassium, and Candesartan, in tablet formulation as above and bilayer tablet formulation having the excipient as above.<br>

optical isomers. The isomers may be separated by various methods, for example enantiomers of<br>
amlodipine via their diastereomeric tartrates (U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,707) or by a combination of<br>
separation and chiral synthesis. Optical isomers of compounds are specified (+) or (-), indicating the<br>
direction the chiral center rotates a plane of polarized light.<br>
(030)	The compatibility (physical &amp; chemical) study was done taking suitable ratio of S (-)<br>
amlodipine besilate with the individual excipients and the combination drugs. The sample mixtures<br>
where blended and triturated gently in glass mortar and pestle and these where filled in glass vials<br>
and sealed with high-density polyethylene closures. Few pinholes where made on the cap for<br>
maintaining the relative humidity and the vials where placed on 40°C ± 2°C/ 75% ± 5% RH. Samples<br>
were analyzed on differential scanning calorimeter &amp; visually for initially, and at the interval of 15<br>
days for one month. The results were compared to check the compatibility (physical &amp; chemical) of<br>
the drug with excipients. It was found that there was change in appearance of the blended drug with<br>
lactose to the extent of light brown shade than the control sample at 25°C ± 2° C &amp; 60% ± 5% RH<br>
and the rest of vials containing drug and excipients blend triturate were satisfactory in appearance as<br>
compared to individual control samples.<br>
(031)	In order to screen for formulation stability we have formulated five different types of process<br>
for the tablet compression. We tried to formulate the tablet by different formulation processes and<br>
the analysis was done by HPLC (make Shimadzu Class VP) using the Ultron ES OVM ovomucoid<br>
chiral column using buffer and Acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 78: 22 respectively and<br>
detection was done at 360 nm. We have specially checked the interconversion of the S (-) isomer of<br>
the amlodipine besilate to R (+) isomer during the compression and the stability studies. The<br>
stability studies were done as per ICH guidelines for 6 months. We found that the conversion of S (-)<br>
isomer to the R (+) isomer was in limit of less than 0.15% after 6 months accelerated stability studies<br>
are as per ICH guidelines in all the formulations.<br><br><br>

Conclusion<br>
(076)	Amlodipine Besilate is a raecemic mixture and a potent molecule that inhibits the<br>
transmembrane influx of calcium ions into smooth muscle and cardiac muscle in the dose between<br>
2.5 mg to 10 mg. The conversion of the S (-) isomer to R (+) isomer even at low levels as 1% will<br>
contribute to the adverse effect The present invention specially describes the development of a<br>
process for controlling the level of R (+) isomer of amlodipine below 0.15%, during the storage and<br>
shelf life, to eliminate the adverse effects associated with R (+) isomer. The formulations according<br>
to the process of example 5 has failed in stability studies of chemical &amp; physical observations and<br>
formulation according to the example 1, 2 and 3 has more process steps, the best suitable<br>
formulation for the S (-) amlodipine besilate has been observed is formulations according to the<br>
process of example 4, which has the excipient as microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic<br>
calcium phosphate, lake of quinoline yellow, colloidal Silicon dioxide, sodium starch glycolate and<br>
magnesium stearate, however formulations in example 1,2 and 3 are physically and chemically<br>
stable as per the stability studies done by ICH conditions. With lower dose tablets the need for good<br>
compressibility and uniform distribution of active drug is crucial and critical factor and selection of<br>
proper and suitable excipients and process is very essential microcrystalline cellulose is a commonly<br>
used compression aid and wacking agent. The dibasic calcium phosphate gives stability to the S (-)<br>
amlodipine and controlling the R (+) isomer within the limit. Disintegrants helps in breakup of tablet<br>
after the administration, as the active material must be released from the tablet matrix as efficiently<br>
as possible to allow rapid dissolution and availability of the drug through formulation to the body<br>
system, sodium starch glycolate is used here as disintegrant. Colloidal silicon dioxide helps in<br>
increasing the flow property of the granules and has excellent glidant properties. The adhesion of the<br>
drug to the punches of the tablet machine must be avoided. When drug accumulates on the punch<br>
surfaces this causes the tablet surface to become pitted and therefore unacceptable. Also sticking of<br>
the drug in this way results in high ejection forces when removing the tablet from the machine. In<br>
practice it is possible to reduce sticking by wet-massing, careful selection of excipients and the use<br>
of high levels of anti-adherents, e.g. magnesium stearate.<br>
(077)	The invention also offers convenience of co-administration of suitable bilayer combination<br>
comprising of S (-) Amlodipine besilate with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, Atenolol, Nebivilol<br>
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, Quinapril Hydrochloride the angiotensin II<br>
inhibitor as losartan potassium, and Candesartan celexitil, in tablet formulation as mentioned in<br>
examples 6-9 and bilayer tablet and tablet in tablet formulation having the excipient as mentioned in<br>
examples 6 to 9 to minimize the contact between active molecules and to avoid chemical<br>
incompatibility.<br><br><br>

6.	A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein beta adrenergic receptor blocker is Atenolol in the dose of 25-100mg and Nebivilol in the dose of 2mg to 10 mg, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor is Ramipril in the dose of from 0.5 to 40 mg and Quinapril hydrochloride in the dose of from 0.5 to 150 mg, wherein said angiotensin II receptor antagonist is Losartan potassium in the dose of from 20 to 200 mg and Candesartan cilexitil in the dose of from 6 to 80 mg, with the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which includes diluents as microcystalline cellulose, Dicalcium phosphate, light Magnesium carbonate ranging from 10% to 90%, binder as Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (6cps to 15 cps), starch (as paste) ranging from 0.1% to 10%, disintegrant sodium starch glycollate, crospovidone ranging from 1% to 10%, lubricant and glidant as magnesium stearate, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide ranging from 0.1% to 5%, disintegrant binder as pregelatinized starch (starch 1500) ranging from 1% to 20%of the total tablet weight.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claimed in claim 1 wherein the stable formulations of tablets containing besilate salt of S (-) Amlodipine were prepared by direct compression method. In this process S (-) Amlodipine besilate (60 mesh pass) in the dose of from 0.5-20mg was geometrically mixed with the lake of quinoline yellow (0.01% to 5 % of<br><br><br>
total tablet weight), sodium starch glycollate (1 to 10%) and anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate (10 to 95% of total tablet weight) and blended for 5 min (all ingredients were previously sieved through 60 mesh). This mixture was then sieved through 60 mesh, geometrically mixed and reblended with microcrystalline cellulose. The resultant was then sieved again through 40 mesh and blended for a further 10 min. Finally Colloidal silicon dioxide (0.1 to 0.8% of tablet weight) and magnesium stearate (0.1 to 5 % of tablet) were passed from 60 mesh was added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The blend was then compressed into tablets using 16 and 27-station rotatory tablet compression machine. The whole procedure was carried out in control condition of temperature (25° c ± 2° C) and relative humidity (40% ± 5% RH) and dark condition protected from direct exposure to light.<br><br><br>
