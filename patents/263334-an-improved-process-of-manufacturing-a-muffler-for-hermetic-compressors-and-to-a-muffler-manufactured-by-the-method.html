AN IMPROVED PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING A MUFFLER FOR<br>
HERMETIC COMPRESSORS AND TO A MUFFLER<br>
MANUFACTURED BY THE METHOD<br><br>
KIRLOSKAR COPELAND LTD.<br>
of 1202/1, Ghole Road, Pune 411 005,<br><br>
Maharashtra, India,<br>
an Indian Company<br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATIO PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES<br>
THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
This invention relates to an improved process of manufacturing a muffler for<br>
hermetic compressors and to a muffler manufactured by the method.<br>
In the prior art mufflers for hermetic compressors, generally used in<br>
refrigeration and air conditioning systems, are typically made by using the<br>
furnace-brazing process.<br>
The conventional furnace brazed muffler mainly comprises a cylindrical<br>
body open at two ends made from a tube a bottom cap/cover with its skirt<br>
extending over the side wall of the body provided at the bottom end of the<br>
body, an opening having neck projecting downward provided in the said<br>
bottom cover, a threaded adapter of discharge muffler provided in the said<br>
opening an impedence tube fitted in the said adaptor a discharge connector<br>
tube fitted in the side opening of the body near its top end and internal<br>
pressure relief valve adaptor for providing internal pressure relief valve is<br>
fitted in the depressed top cover, all the components being fixed by<br>
interference fit and furnace brazed.<br>
The existing process of manufacturing muffler for compressors using<br>
furnace brazing comprises the following steps:<br>
(i) Preparing all components of the muffler independently by suitable<br>
manufacturing process. Like the body of the muffler is formed<br>
from the tube or the steel sheet.<br>
(ii) Cleaning of all components with suitable chemicals ensuring that<br>
all the components are free from rust and dust and loose particles.<br>
2<br><br>
(iii) Fixed to each other by interference fit method at the desired<br>
location.<br>
(iv) Once the assembly is ready before brazing the copper wire or paste<br>
is applied.<br>
(v) The assembly with copper applied at desired location passing<br>
through the furnace or kept in the furnace having inert atmosphere<br>
and having temperature above the melting point of copper is about<br>
1000°C in the furnace the muffler assembly is passed through<br>
different temperature zones before melting and after melting of<br>
copper.<br>
(vi) The complete brazed muffler cooling at very slow rate, so that<br>
oxidation is avoided after he brazing operation is completed.<br>
The disadvantages of the conventional furnace brazing process are as<br>
follows: -<br>
a)	The cost of maintaining an inert atmosphere is very high in<br>
furnace required for brazing<br>
b)	The cost of furnace maintenance is high compared to welding<br>
process.<br>
c)	The joint design has to be very good, since there is no control<br>
while the filler copper metal is melting.<br>
d)	The defects in the brazed joints can only be detected after<br>
completion of furnace brazing<br>
e)	It is very difficult to maintain the geometrical relations of the<br>
assembly components; it needs very high cost equipment to<br>
obtain dimensional consistency.<br>
3<br><br>
f)	The leakage or any flaw in the brazed joint cannot be repaired<br>
after furnace brazing.<br>
g)	The leak testing is only possible with the help of dry air or<br>
nitrogen or helium, which is a very costly process since leak<br>
detection is possible only through very complicated leak test<br>
rig.<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate the above mentioned<br>
disadvantages or short corning of the existing process of manufacturing a<br>
muffler for compressors and to provide an improved process of<br>
manufacturing the muffler for compressors which is cost effective and gives<br>
a very high production rate, Besides, there is no need for costly equipments,<br>
no need of filler material no need of maintaining an inert atmosphere and at<br>
the same time the process provides high geometrical accuracies of the<br>
components and high strength of the joints.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a improved process of manufacturing<br>
muffler for hermetic compressors comprising the steps:<br>
a)	manufacturing body of the muffler in a cylindrical shell form having<br>
one end closed and the other end open, the said open end being flared<br>

c)	forming a subassembly of the body, discharge connector tube and<br>
internal pressure relief valve adaptor.<br>
d)	forming another sub-assembly of the cover plate, threaded adaptor and<br>
the impedance tube:<br>
e)	cleaning the said two sub-assemblies for removing any rust and dust;<br>
and<br>
f)	welding the said two sub-assemblies together at the cup shaped collar<br>
portion of the body, with the help of a fixture, using projection<br>
resistance welding process.<br>
Typically in the improved process for manufacturing Muffler, the said body<br>
is manufactured from steel sheet by deep drawing technique.<br>
Typically in the two sub-assemblies are formed separately by brazing<br>
preferable by silver brazing.<br>
Typically the two sub-assemblies are thoroughly washed preferably by using<br>
chemicals for removing my rust and dust.<br>

furnace before melting zone having a temperature of about 100° C. Brazed<br>
muffler having furnace-brazing joints 10 is cooled at a very slow rate to<br>
avoid oxidation.<br>
The disadvantage associated with conventional process of muffler<br>
manufacturing, using furnace brazing has been described herein before.<br>
8<br><br>
Now referring to Fig 3 to Fig 12B the improved process of manufacturing<br>
Muffler according to this invention comprises the following steps: -<br>
(a)	Manufacturing the body  1A of the muffler from the steel sheet<br>
preferably by deep drawing technique such that the cylindrical<br>
body/shell is having one end IB closed and the other end 1C open,<br>
The open end is flared out forming a cup shaped collar, which is<br>
adopted to be closed by a cover plate 4a-using projection resistance<br>
welding process as described hereinafter. An opening is provided in<br>
the sidewall of the body for discharge connector tube 3. The necessity<br>
of fixing top cover 8 as needed in the prior art muffler is eliminated<br>
and the closed end Ib of the body is provided with an opening for<br>
internal pressure" relief valve adaptor 7<br>
(b)	Other components like discharge connector tube 3, impendence tube<br>
9, internal pressure relief valve 6, internal pressure relief valve<br>
adaptor 7, bottom threaded adaptor 2 of discharge muffler, bottom<br>
cover plate 4A are manufactured, separately in the usual manner.<br>
(c)	The subassembly of the body 1A, discharge connector tube 3 and<br>
internal  pressure   relief valve  (IPRV)  adaptor  7   is  carried  out<br>
separately preferably by using silver brazing 11.<br>
(d)The subassembly of bottom cover plate 4A and bottom threaded<br>
adaptor 2 and impedance tube 9 is carried out separately preferably by<br>
using silver brazing 11.<br>
(e) These two subassemblies are washed thoroughly for removing any<br>
rust and dust preferably by using suitable chemicals and are coated<br>
with iron phosphate coating.<br>
9<br><br>
(f) These two subassemblies are welded together at the cup shaped collar<br>
portion by using a fixture and projection resistance welding process.<br>
According to this invention projection resistance welding process is used for<br>
welding the two subassemblies of the muffler. Resistance welding is a<br>
process used to join metal parts with the electric current. The various forms<br>
of resistance welding known are spot welding, seam welding, projection<br>
welding and butt-welding. In all these forms of resistance welding, the parts<br>
are locally heated until a molten pool is formed. The parts are then allowed<br>
to cool and the pool freezes to form a weld nugget/joint. According to this<br>
invention instead of nugget shaped weldment the entire peripheral joint of<br>
the bottom cover plate and the body is provided a weldment 5. The cup<br>
shaped end 1C of the body 1A is provided with desired fillest radius to<br>
accommodate bottom cover plate. The bottom cover plate 4A is having its<br>
periphery tapered by an angle ranging fro 1° to 5°. In the joined portion of<br>
bottom cover plate 4A and bottom threaded adaptor 2, the opening of bottom<br>
cover plate has an inside taper of 1° to 3° and the adaptor has in mating<br>
portion a chamfor of 40° to 60°. For projection resistance welding to create<br>
heat, copper electrode pass an electric current through the work pieces. Heat<br>
generated depends on the electrical resistance and thermal conductivity of<br>
the metal and the time that current is applied. Copper is used for the<br>
electrode because it has low resistance and high thermal conductivity<br>
compared to most metals. This ensures that the heat is generated in the work<br>
pieces instead of the electrodes. The fixtures used are generally made of<br>
brass.<br>
10<br><br>
The fixture used for carrying out the projection resistance welding of the<br>
muffler is shown in Fig. 7 to 12B and mainly comprises a right angle block<br>
14 provided with a rib 13 and a hole 15 for accommodating therein the<br>
muffler assembly 16. A slot 17 is also providing in the block 14 adjacent to<br>
the hole 15, for accommodating therein discharge connector tube 3. Split<br>
type electrode 12 is mounted on the block 14 around the hole 15. The<br>
electrode 12, which surrounds the cup shaped end 1C of the muffler, consists<br>
of a fixed electrode 12A and a moving electrode 12B, splitted from the<br>
center line of the lower circular electrode assembly 12. Each part of the<br>
lower electrode is provided with a handle 20. The upper electrode 18 is<br>
made in a hollow circular tubular body form according to the size of the<br>
cover plate 4a. The fixed electrode part 12A is provided with tubes 12C for<br>
electrode cooling and the moving electrode part 12B is attached to<br>
pneumatic /hydraulic /mechanical device 12D for providing linear<br>
movement to it. Supply links 19 are provided for supplying electric current<br>
to the lower and upper electrode.<br>
The Advantages of projection welded Mufflers.<br>
a)	Proposed inventive method of Muffler construction with Projection<br>
welding eliminates need of top cover since top cover formed from the<br>
body itself.<br>
b)	The production rate is very high compared to furnace -brazed<br>
muffler.<br>
c)	No filler material is required at the welding joint.<br>
d)	No need of inert atmosphere during welding since welding cycle time<br>
is very short.<br>
11<br><br>
e)	The geometrical accuracies are maintained, since there is control over<br>
muffler components sub assembly.<br>
f)	The leak testing of the muffler assembly can be done in appropriate<br>
chemical bath where water is used as a solvent.<br>
g)	The projection welding fixtures are very cost effective, resulting in<br>
the less cost of the equipments required.<br>
h) The strength of the welded joint is equal or more compared to brazed<br>
joint.<br>
