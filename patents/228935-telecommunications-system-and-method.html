				<td>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to telecommunications systems for communicating internet packets between a mobile communications user equipment forming a correspondent node and a mobile node via an external packet data communications network. More particularly, the present invention relates to gateway support nodes for communicating internet packets between an external packet data communications network and a packet radio network.<br>
In one embodiment the gateway support node forms a gateway for a General Packet Radio System (GPRS) network, known as a GPRS Gateway Support Node (GGSN). Background of the Invention<br>
The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) has been developed for communicating efficiently data packets to and from mobile user equipment via a second generation mobile radio network such as the Global system for Mobiles (GSM) or a third generation mobile radio network such as the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). GPRS provides support for a packet-orientated service, which attempts to optimise network and radio resources for packet data communications such as for example Internet Packets (IP). The GPRS provides a logical architecture, which is related to the circuit switched architecture of the second or third generation mobile radio network.<br>
Generally, the GPRS network will be connected to another packet data telecommunications network, which may also be connected to further packet data telecommunications network. The network to which the GPRS network is connected will be referred to hi the following description as an external network. The GPRS network for communicating data between a mobile communications user equipment (UE) and the external network comprises: a gateway support node (GGSN) which provides an interface between the external network and the user equipment. The GPRS network also includes a service support node (SGSN) which is operable to<br>
control communication of data packets between the gateway support node and the user equipment using a radio network controller (RNC) which controls radio resources of the telecommunications network.<br>
The Internet Protocol as developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has become a preferred way of communicating packet data via telecommunications networks. Whilst version 4 of the Internet Protocol (Ipv4) has been standardised and has been deployed in many fixed networks, version 6 of the Internet Protocol is being developed in order to provide improved facilities. Amongst these improvements is a facility to communicate internet packets to and from mobile nodes, which roam from a home network to foreign network during an IP session [1]. Generally, following a process known as route optimisation which will be described shortly, a source and a destination address in the header of IP data packets being set from and to a mobile node (MN) respectively will change as a result of the MN roaming to the foreign network.<br>
The mobile node may communicate Internet packets with a correspondent node (CN) which is attached to a GPRS network. As a result the GGSN of the GPRS network must be arranged to route the internet packets via an appropriate bearer to the correspondent node, which itself may be mobile. If the mobile node roams to a foreign network mid-session then the GGSN must be arranged to route the internet packets to the correspondent node (mobile user equipment) via an appropriate bearer. The appropriate bearer will have been set up by the GGSN when a session initiation was established at a time when the mobile node was attached to its home network. As such the parameters for the bearer will have been established with reference a home address of the mobile node as the source address. However as explained above, the source address in the header of the internet packets will change during the session from the home address of the mobile node, when attached to its home network, to a care-of-address after the mobile node roams to the foreign network. Without adaptation, the GGSN will therefore drop internet packets with the care-of-address of the mobile node as source address rather than routing the packets via the bearer established for the mobile node's home address to the correspondent node.<br>
It has previously been proposed to provide a mobile node's home address in an extension header field known as the hop-by-hop field. As such the GGSN will be able<br>
to identify the appropriate bearer through which internet packets can be routed to a correspondent node (CN) attached to the GPRS network, because the mobile node's home address provides the source address with respect to which the appropriate bearer was set up. Generally, however there remains a technical problem to improve inter-working between the Internet Protocol, in particular but not exclusively Ipv6 and a packet radio system such as but not exclusively the GPRS.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications system for communicating internet packets between a mobile communications user equipment forming a correspondent node and a mobile node via an external packet data communications network. The system comprises a packet radio network operable to provide a plurality of packet data bearers for communicating the internet packets with nodes attached to the packet radio network. Each of the bearers is defined with respect to a source address of the internet packets, the packet radio network including a gateway support node (GGSN) operable to provide an interface between the external network and the packet radio network. The gateway support node (GGSN) is operable<br>
to detect whether an internet packet is for providing a binding update to the correspondent node of a first source address of the mobile node to a care-of-address of the mobile node, and if the internet packet is a binding update,<br>
to allow egress of internet packets sent from the correspondent node having the care-of-address of the mobile node as the destination address from the gateway support node to the external network.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention address a technical problem associated with a potential theft of service which may occur if an unscrupulous user of a mobile user equipment attempts to use resources on a telecommunications network such as the GPRS network or another data communications network to which the GPRS network is connected. The theft of service may occur if the user uses an unauthorised destination address for Internet packets sent from the mobile user equipment acting as correspondent node. An unauthorised address might be for example an address which can be used to communicate internet packets, using resources on a GPRS/UMTS network or other network for which a user has not subscribed. In order to prevent such a theft of service, a security function within the GGSN known as Service Based Local Policy is used to form a gate, and is arranged to allow internet packets to pass out from the gateway support node if the destination address has been authorised.<br>
As explained above, the hop-by-hop extension header field of an Ipv6 packet is arranged to include the home address of a mobile node which has roamed to a foreign network and therefore has a care-of-address as the destination address for Internet<br><br>
packets sent from the correspondent node. In order to allow legitimate data packets to pass to a neighbouring telecommunications network to which the gateway support node is connected, the gateway support node is arranged to examine the hop-by-hop field as well as the destination address field in the Internet packet header. If the hop-by-hop field or the destination address field includes a legitimate address, then the Internet packet is allowed to pass through the gateway support node to an external network. A technical problem is thereby created in reducing the likelihood of a theft of service, if the unscrupulous user arranges for internet packets to include an unauthorised destination address in the destination address field, whilst including the mobile node's home address in the hop-by-hop field. This is because the SBLP function in the GGSN should be arranged to drop Internet packets in a situation where the destination address is unauthorised, even if the hop-by-hop field includes an mobile node's home address which is legitimate.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide telecommunication system in which the gateway support node is arranged to identify a care-of-address of a mobile node in association with the home address of that mobile node. The care-of-address is identified following receipt of a binding update message, which is required for route optimisation. The mobile node's care-of-address is then made available to the security function of the gateway support node. In order to reduce the likelihood of a successful theft of service attack, a security function in the gateway support node is arranged to allow the Internet packets to pass only if both the mobile node's home address in the hop-by-hop field and the mobile node's care-of-address are legitimate. To this end, the gateway support node may store the care-of-address provided from a binding update message in association with the mobile node's home address.<br>
Various further aspects and features of the present inventions are defined in the appended claims. These aspects include a gateway support node and a method of communicating internet packets.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments Mobile Packet Radio Network Architecture<br>
An example architecture of a packet radio network which is arranged to support packet data communications is provided in Figure 1 and explained in more detail in Annex 1. To assist in understanding and explaining the embodiments of the present invention and the advantages provided by such embodiments, a brief description will be provided here. The packet radio network presented in Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement which conforms to the GPRS/UMTS standard and provides a packet radio network for communicating internet data packets with nodes which are attached to the network via terrestrial radio bearers referred to as UTRAN. The packet radio network includes a Gateway Support Node (GGSN) which is operable to provide an interface between an external network PDN and the nodes attached to the GPRS/UMTS network. Since the nodes are communicating via the UTRAN radio interface they may be generally mobile nodes. However in the following description the mobile user equipment (UE) which are attached to the packet radio network will be referred to as correspondent nodes CN. As will be explained shortly, the GPRS/UMTS network provides a plurality of packet data bearers for communicating internet packets from the GGSN to the correspondent nodes CN and from the correspondent nodes CN to the GGSN. Typically, packets received from correspondent nodes by the GGSN are allowed to egress from the packet radio network to the external packet communications network PDN. These packets may be destined for other nodes which may be attached to the external network PDN or may be attached other networks, the packets reaching these nodes via the external network PDN. <br>
IP Route Optimisation<br>
Route optimisation is a known as part of the internet protocol standard version 6 (IPV6) and may be performed for a node which roams from a home network to a foreign network. The route optimisation is a process by which a node which changes its affiliation from a home network to foreign network can be arranged to communicate internet packets to and from the node via the foreign network without<br>
being routed via the home network. A node which changes its affiliation by roaming from its home network to a foreign network will be referred to in the following description as a mobile node.<br>
As is conventional with the internet protocol, nodes which communicate internet packets between each other provide the destination address as well as the source address in the internet packet header. Figure 2 provides an illustration of a route optimisation process between a correspondent node attached to a GPRS network CN and a mobile node MN. In Figure 2 the correspondent node CN is communicating internet packets to and from the mobile node MN whilst the correspondent network MN is affiliated with a GPRS/UMTS network 200. As illustrated by two positions of the mobile node MN 202, 204, the mobile node which was originally communicating internet packets with the correspondent network CN via its home network 210 moves to a foreign network 212. Thus originally the mobile node MN was communicating internet packets via its home agent HA. When the mobile node MN moves from the home network 210 at position 202 to a foreign network 212 at position 204 internet packets according to a conventional operation of Ipv4 would have to be routed via the home agent. That is to say the destination address for packets sent to the mobile node MN would be its home address, and the source address of packet sents from the mobile node MN would be its home address. As such, internet packets would have to be routed via the foreign network 212 and the home network 210 to and from the correspondent node CN via the GPRS/UMTS network 200. It will be appreciated that routing packets via the home agent after the mobile node MN has roamed to the foreign network consumes network resources unnecessarily and further increases the delay hi communication of the internet packets.<br>
As mentioned above, route optimisation is a process by which internet packets are communicated between the correspondent node CN and the mobile node MN without having to pass through the home agent HA thereby reducing the resources used to communicate the internet packets. Typically a delay in communicating packets is also reduced.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 effectively provide a summary of relevant parts of the route optimisation process which will be useful in understanding the embodiments of the present invention which will be described shortly. Figure 3 provides an example<br>
illustration of Internet packet headers before and after route optimisation. In Figure 3 internet packet 300 provides an illustration of an internet packet (IP) header to be sent from the mobile node MN when attached to the home network at position 202 to the correspondent node CN when attached to the GPRS network 200. The Internet packet header 300 includes the address of the correspondent node CN within a destination field 302 and the home address of the mobile node (MN) within a source address field 304. The Internet packet header 300 also includes a further field known as the hop-by-hop field 306 which will be explained shortly. The IP header 300 for communication from the mobile node (MN) to the correspondent node (CN) is known as a down-link internet packet.<br>
For the up-link, that is to say from the correspondent node CN to the mobile node MN, an Internet packet header 310 is shown to include within the destination field 312 the home address of the mobile node MN and within the source address field 314 the address of the correspondent node CN.<br>
Following route optimisation in accordance with a change of affiliation of the mobile node, the mobile node MN must inform the correspondent node of its new address. The new address, that is the address to be used to access the mobile node MN via the foreign network, is known as the care-of-address. To inform the correspondent node CN of the care-of-address of the mobile node MN, the mobile node MN sends the correspondent node CN a binding update message.<br>
An example of binding update message is shown in Figure 3 by a representation of an internet packet header 320. As before the destination address field 322 hi the IP header 320 contains the address of the correspondent node CN, whereas the source address field 324 uses the care-of-address of the mobile node MN. An extended header field 326 provides a Mobile Header (MH) type with a value equal to "5" indicating that the internet packet provides a binding update. The payload field 328 contains the value of "0". The binding update internet packet 320 is sent from the mobile node MN to the correspondent node CN.<br>
In response to the binding update the correspondent node CN updates its cash address store shown in Figure 2 as a data store 220. The cash stores the care-of-address of the mobile node MN in association with the original home address of the mobile node. The correspondent node CN then responds to the binding update 320 by<br>
sending a binding update acknowledgement in the form of an Internet packet header 332. The binding update acknowledgement 332 contains the care-of-address of the mobile node MN in the destination address field 334 and the address of the correspondent node CN in the source address field 336. The binding update acknowledgement message is distinguished from the binding update message by the MH type field being set equal to "6" as shown in extension header field 338. Again, the data field contains the value of "0".<br>
Following the binding update the internet packet header for the down-link 350 now includes the care-of-address of the mobile node MN in the source field 352. Correspondingly, the destination field, of the internet packet sent to the mobile node MN contains the care-of-address of the mobile node in the internet packet header 360.<br>
Should the correspondent node itself change its affiliation either within the network or to a foreign network then correspondingly a binding update would be performed by the correspondent node CN. As illustrated in Figure 2 the cash address store of the mobile node 230 is then updated to include the care-of-address of the correspondent node CN in association with the address of the correspondent node CN with the effect that subsequent Internet packets use the care-of-address of the correspondent node CN in place of the home address of the correspondent node.<br>
Traffic Flow Template (TFT based packet filtering at the GGSN)<br>
An example embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figure 4 which provides elements forming part of the GPRS/UMTS network which appears hi Figure 2. In Figure 4 a gateway support node (GGSN) 400 is shown together with a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 402 and a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network part (UTRAN) 404. The GGSN 400, the SGSN 402 and the UTRAN 404 form part of the packet radio network as represented in Figure 1 for communicating data packets to and from mobile User Equipment (UE) 406, which for the illustrative explanation forms the correspondent node CN. The UTRAN 404 includes RNCs and Node Bs as represented hi Figure 1 and provides a facility for communicating packets via a radio access interface formed by the Node B with the UE 406.<br>
Figure 4 provides an illustration of the protocol stacks which exists within each of the GGSN 400, SGSN 402 and UTRAN 404 for communicating data packets to and from the user equipment 406. To support the following explanation of embodiments of the invention the protocol stacks will be briefly described.<br>
The GGSN 400 forms an interface between the GPRS/UMTS network 200 and the external packet data communications network PDN 212 which in the following explanation forms the foreign network to which the mobile node roams. Internet data packets are received via a physical layer L1/ L2 410 and are received at a mobile IP layer which operates in accordance with IPV6 412. To communicate the Internet packets received from the foreign network 212, a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol layer GTP-U 414 encapsulates the internet packets and in combination with a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) layer 416 communicates the IP data packet to the SGSN via the interface Gn/Gp using an internet protocol layer 418 and a physical layer L1/L2 420. Correspondingly, within the SGSN in order to provide routing and delivery of the internet protocol packets, packets received via a link layer L1/L2 422 are delivered to a mobile IP layer 424 via a corresponding IP layer 426, a UDP layer 428 and a GTP-U layer 430. The mobile IP layer 424 then routes the IP data packet to the appropriate radio network controller (not shown) which is include within the UTRAN 404. Thus, the IP data packet is tunnelled through a further GTP-U layer 440, a UDP layer 442, and an IP layer 444 through a link layer L1/L2 446 via an lu-ps interface to the corresponding link layer 450 within the UTRAN 404. The IP data packet is then tunnelled correspondingly through the IP layer 452, the UDP layer 454 and the GTP-U layer 456 to the mobile IP layer IPV6 460. The Internet packet is correspondingly routed to the appropriate Node B (not shown) where corresponding layers are engaged to communicate the data packet via a radio access bearer layer 462 to the mobile user equipment 406.<br>
As will be appreciated hi the up-link direction, that is from the correspondent node CN 406 to the GGSN, corresponding tunnelling is employed to route the Internet packets back to the GGSN so that the internet packet can egress from the GPRS/UMTS network 200 to the foreign network 212.<br>
Also included within the GPRS/UMTS elements shown in Figure 4 in the GGSN 400 is a Traffic Flow Template (TFT) controller 470 and a Service Based<br>
Policy (SBLP) controller 472. The TFT 470 and the SBLP 472 operate in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention as will be described shortly to manage the communication of IP data packets from the GGSN to the mobile UE (CN) and from the mobile UE (CN) to the GGSN and outward to the foreign network 212.<br>
In the following description the mobile UE 406 forms the correspondent node CN as represented in Figure 2, whereas a node from which the UE 406 receives internet data packets and sends internet data packets to forms a mobile node which roams to the foreign network 212 as explained with reference to Figure 2.<br>
In order to provide an explanation of the embodiments of the present invention the operation of the TFT controller 470 which is shown in Figure 4 will be briefly described with reference to Figure 5. Traffic Flow Template Controller<br>
Figure 5 provides a simplified representation of elements shown in Figure 4 in order to provide an explanation of the operation of the TFT controller. In Figure 5 a simplified representation of the GGSN 400, SGSN 402 and UTRAN 404 are shown to illustrate how internet packets are communicated in the down-link direction, from the mobile node MN to the correspondent node CN. As shown in Figure 5 the TFT controller 500 which operates in the GGSN mobile IP layer 412 is provided with a list of source addresses 502 which are used to control the communication of IP data packets in accordance with a source address included within the Internet packet header. The TFT 500 arranges to communicate the IP data packets via an appropriate bearer which has been set up using the packet data protocol context activation which may be initiated by an application in the UE (CN), or on the mobile node MN and is analogous to logging onto a required destination.<br>
To select an appropriate UMTS bearer the GGSN to establish a traffic flow template hi accordance with the following parameters:<br>
•	IPV4 source address type<br>
•	IPV6 source address type<br>
•	Protocol identifier/next header type<br>
•	Single destination port type<br>
•	Destination port range type<br>
•	Single source port type<br>
•	Source port range type<br>
•	Security perimeter index type<br>
•	Type of service/Traffic class type<br>
•	Flow level type<br>
For each PDF context to be used for a multimedia session a traffic flow template is generated by the mobile terminal and sent to the GGSN which subsequently uses this traffic flow template to filter incoming packets based on information provided in the template. For example, for packets sent from an Ipv6 mobile node, the correspondent node CN will create a traffic flow template which creates the IP address of the mobile node as the Ipv6 source address for packets in the down-link direction.<br>
As shown hi Figure 5 an internet packet 504 received from the external packet data communications network 212 on the down-link, for communication to the correspondent node 406 may include the address of the correspondent node CN in the destination address field 506. The internet packet may include the home address of the mobile node in the source address field 508.<br>
In operation the TFT controller 500 checks the source address of the internet packet against the list 502 and routes the internet packet via the appropriate data bearer which has been set up within the TFT controller for communicating the Internet packet to the respective correspondent node CN. However, what happens when the mobile network roams from its home network 210 to the foreign network 212 as shown in Figure 2?<br>
As explained with reference to Figure 3, following route optimisation the source address for the mobile node will be the care-of-address of the mobile node. Thus, after route optimisation has been performed an Internet packet 510 corresponding to the Internet packet 504 will be sent from the mobile node to the GGSN for communication to the correspondent node CN 406. As shown the IP header 510 received from the mobile node MN when attached to the foreign network 212 includes within its destination address field 512 the home address of the correspondent node 406, but within its source address field the care-of-address of the mobile node 514. The TFT has a packet bearer which has been set up and defined for conveying<br>
the internet packets to correspondent nodes in respect of the source address. However, the internet packet 510 received from the mobile node after it has roamed to the foreign network 212 will not be recognised by the TFT controller 500 and so the packet will be dropped, unless some adaptation of the GGSN is provided. An adapted GGSN forms an embodiment of the invention.<br>
A previously proposed solution for addressing the inter-working between the TFT controller 500 in the GGSN after route optimisation is to include the home address of the mobile node MN within an extension header field known as the hop-by-hop field 516. By including the home address of the mobile node within the hop-by-hop field 516, the TFT controller can identify the appropriate bearer which should be used to convey an Internet packet to the correspondent node CN. This is the packet bearer, which was set up during a PDF context activation as part of a session initiation. Thus, if the mobile node roams to a foreign network during mid-session then by providing the home address of the mobile node in the hop-by-hop field the TFT controller 500 can identify the appropriate bearer to be used to convey the internet packets to the correspondent node 406. The hop-by-hop address field is also known as the routing header type two (extension to header of IP6 packets).<br>
In summary, by analysing the hop-by-hop field in combination with the source address field the TFT controller 500 can identify the appropriate bearer 520 to communicate the Internet packets to the correspondent node CN because the list 502 includes the home address of the mobile node. However, a technical problem is presented by providing the home address of the mobile node in the hop-by-hop field, in order that the TFT controller 500 can identify the appropriate IP data bearer. This problem will be explained in the following section.<br>
Inter-working Mobile IPV6 with SBLP of IMS in GPRS/UMTS<br>
Figure 6 provides a simplified diagram of parts of the GPRS/UMTS network shown in Figure 4 and configured for communicating data packets on the up-link from the correspondent node CN to the mobile node MN as previously discussed with reference to Figure 5 for down-link communications.<br>
In Figure 6 a bearer 600 which was initiated by the correspondent node CN using a PDP context activation is provided for up-link communications to the mobile node MN. An example of an Internet packet header 602 communicated with an Internet packet on the up-link is sent through the bearer 600 through the UTRAN 404, the SGSN 402 to the GGSN 400 and outward to the foreign network 212. However, within the GGSN 400, the SBLP is provided in order to police access by the CN (mobile user equipment) to the quality of service resources in the UMTS network and further out into the external packet data communications network 212. As mentioned above, the SBLP 472 operates to effect a policy function as a policy decision point or policy enforcement point in order to prevent theft of service attacks by unscrupulous parties. For example, an unscrupulous party may wish to gain access to IP multimedia subsystem services (IMS) even though the party has not subscribed to the services. One possibility for gaining unauthorised access to UMTS services as a theft of service would be to use an unauthorised address associated with a source or a destination which is unknown or unauthorised by the GGSN network, whilst providing a legitimate address in the hop-by-hop field 306.<br>
For an IMS session that is activated and authorised by the SBLP 472, an SBLP is provided with a data store 604 which is arranged to store information representing a template which contains a mobile node's original home address as the destination address. The SBLP compares the destination address of each up-link data packet as it is communicated from the GGSN to the external network 212 with respect to a set of authorised destination addresses provided within the data store 604. However, if the mobile node MN roams to the foreign network FN then the destination address will now become the care-of-address of the MN. An example of such an IP header 608 which has the care-of-address of the mobile network MN in the destination address<br>
field 610 as a result of the mobile node MN roaming during a session 608 is shown in Figure 6. This IP header 608 includes the care-of-address of the mobile network in the destination field 612.<br>
In order to prevent the SBLP 472 dropping outgoing internet packets communicated from a legitimate correspondent node CN to a mobile node MN the hop-by-hop field is again utilised to contain the original home address of the mobile node. Therefore, as shown in Figure 6 the up-link data packet 608 is arranged to include the home address of the mobile node MN in the hop-by-hop field option 610. Therefore, since the correspondent node CN uses the care-of-address of the MN but includes the home address of the mobile node MN in the hop-by-hop option header the SBLP 472 in the GGSN 400 can compare the address in the hop-by-hop field with the list of registered addresses within the data store 604. If the hop-by-hop field matches the home address of the mobile node MN, the Internet packet is allowed out through the GGSN 400 to the foreign network 212.<br>
As explained above, an unscrupulous correspondent node (mobile user equipment) operating using Ipv6 may start an IMS session to access IMS services although it may not be authorised or may not have subscribed to such an IMS services. To this end, the unscrupulous party may put the authorised home address of the mobile node in the hop-by-hop field and then include any address in the destination address field whereby the packet may be sent to an unauthorised destination. Since the hop-by-hop field contains an authorised address of the mobile node MN, the packet passes through the SBLP 472 thereby allowing the unscrupulous party access to IMS services and UMTS resources without authorisation. Secure Authorisations between the TFT with SBLP<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7 provides a simplified representation of parts of the GPRS network shown in Figure 4. However, in Figure 7 the GGSN has been adapted to provide an improvement which reduces a likelihood of a successful theft of service by an unscrupulous party. To this end, the TFT controller 700 is arranged to detect the mobile node's care-of-address and to provide the care-of-address to the SBLP controller 702. The SBLP controller 702 is arranged to allow egress of Internet packets on the up-link if both the hop-by-<br>
hop field and the destination address field contain legitimate address. The SBLP is therefore provided with a list of authorised addresses in a data store 704. The operation of the TFT controller 700 and the SBLP controller 702 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
Following route optimisation during a session the mobile node MN which roams from the home network 210 to the foreign network FN 212 forms a binding update as described above. The corresponding binding update packet 706 is illustrated in Figure 7 as received at the GGSN 400 by the TFT controller 700. The CBU will use the MN's care-of-address as the destination address in the basic Ipv header. The CBU will also carry the mobile node's original home address in the hop-by-hop field 712 so that the TFT controller will allow the CBU to pass through the GGSN. However, upon recognising the CBU 706 as a binding update, the TFT controller 700 will record the source address (mobile node's care-of-address) in the address field 706 in association with the original home address of the mobile node in the list of authorised source addresses provided in the data store 720. The TFT controller 700 is thereby associating the mobile node's care-of-address with the mobile node's home address.<br>
As already explained, the binding update message uses the MH type value equal to "5". When a packet arrives with an un-matching source address with that contained in the list of authorised source addresses provided to the TFT controller 700 the source address is read as the care-of-address of the mobile node 706. Thereafter, all packets which are received at the TFT controller 700 carrying the care-of-address of the mobile node 706 will be identified and sent through the corresponding bearer identified by that care-of-address (source address) as was previously done for the mobile node's home address. However, in order to ensure authentication of the new care-of-address of the mobile node MN, in one embodiment the TFT controller 700 may look for the binding update acknowledgement message from the correspondent node CN. As explained above, the binding update acknowledgement is identified by the MH type value "6" as defined in MIPV6 draft section 6.1.8 page 36. Therefore, the TFT controller 700 will only use the care-of-address for the mobile node if the TFT controller receives and identifies a binding acknowledgement with a status value of "zero" indicating that the binding update has been accepted.<br>
In an alternative embodiment a secure binding update may be effected by using the mobile IPV6 return routeability procedure between the correspondent node CN and the mobile node (described in mobile IPV6 section 5, section 9.4 and section 14). Thus, for each PDF context established, the associated TFT contains the source address of the mobile node or the care-of-address of the mobile node when the mobile node is attached to a foreign network.<br>
In order to permit access to UMTS resources and an IMS session in which a likelihood of successful theft of service attack from an unscrupulous party is reduced, the SELF will check each packet accessing IMS services for its destination address. The SBLP controller will check the destination address carried in the basic IPV6 header and the original home address of the MN in the hop-by-hop field option. The packet may only egress from the GGSN if both the destination address matches the mobile node's care-of-address and the address in the hop-by-hop field matches the home address of the mobile node as the destination address in the SBLP information template 704. The GGSM will otherwise block any packets sent from a mobile user equipment (correspondent node) using an unauthorised destination address. To this end, a security associate SA is created in association with the TFT controller 700 and the SBLP controller 702. The security associate SA includes the care-of-address of the mobile node. Following a binding update the mobile node moves to the care-of-address following roaming to a foreign network so that the source address of the mobile node will be the care-of-address of the mobile node MN. Therefore, packets may be only sent out from the GGSN on the up-link from the SBLP if both the hop-by-hop option of up-link packet headers include the home address of the destination which is the mobile node's or the security associate SA provides a care-of-address for the mobile node. The care-of-address of the mobile node MN may be stored with the home address of the mobile node in the data store 704.<br>
Summary of Operation<br>
Figure 8 provides a flow diagram which illustrated the operation of a gateway support according to an embodiment of the invention. A description of the flow shown in Figure 8 is summarised as follows:<br>
S1: Internet packets are received by the GGSN from the external packet data communications network, which are to be communicated to the nodes attached to<br>
a packet radio network of the GGSN forms part. The packet radio network provides a plurality of bearers for communicating the internet packets to the nodes.<br>
S2: The GGSN identifies the appropriate bearer for communicating a received internet packet to a correspondent node from the source address in the source address field of the IP header.<br>
S4: However, if the GGSN does not recognise the source address, then the GGSN examines a hop-by-hop field in an extension of the IP header. If the hop-by-hop field includes an address for which one of the packet bearers was established, then this bearer is used to convey the packet.<br>
S6: The GGSN receives an internet packet and determines whether the internet packet is a binding update.<br>
S8: If the packet is a binding update then the GGSN associates the care-of-address of the mobile node, providing as the source address of the binding update, with the original source address for the mobile node, which may be the mobile node's home address.<br>
S10: Following the association the GGSN may identify the appropriate bearer for communicating down-link packets from the mobile node's care-of-address as the source address.<br>
S12: The GGSN arranges for the mobile node's care-of-address, which was detected in step S8 from the binding update packet to a security function, such as for example a Service Based Local Policy (SBLP). This may be effected for example using a security associate.<br>
S14: The GGSN examines packets received from the correspondent node for egress from the packet radio network to the external node. The GGSN only allows packets to egress from the packet radio network to the external network, if both the source address contains a legitimate address and the hop-by-hop field contains a legitimate care-of-address.<br>
Optionally, the GGSN may confirm the mobile node's care-of-address detected from the binding up-date packet, by detecting the binding update acknowledgement received back from the correspondent node CN. In alternative embodiments confirmation may be effected by using a reverse routeability confirmation.<br>
Various further aspects and features of the present invention are defined in the appended claims. Various modifications can be made to the embodiments herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
ANNEX 1<br>
GPRS/UMTS Architecture<br>
The terminology and architecture used in Figure 1 corresponds to that used for the UMTS and that proposed for 3G as administered by the 3GPP, more details for which may be found in [1]. In Figure 1, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is connected to an external Packet Data Network 102, (PDN). The external PDN communicates as packets using the Internet Protocol (IP). An interface 104 between the GGSN and the external network is labelled Gi which has been standardised although further aspects are being standardised. Also connected to the GGSN is a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 106 via an interface 108 labelled as Gn/Gp which is also being standardised.<br>
The GGSN and the SGSN are two of network components, which are required to support GPRS. The GGSN acts as the gateway between the external packet data networks (PDN) and the mobile network, which supports GPRS. The GGSN contains sufficient information to route incoming IP data packets to the SGSN that is serving a particular User Equipment (UE) which is mobile and receives data via a radio access facility provided by the mobile packet radio network. For the example embodiment the radio access facility is provided in accordance with the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) system which is specified in accordance with the 3 GPP standard. The SGSN is connected to the GGSN via a Gn interface if the SGSN is within the same Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), and connected via the Gp interface to GGSNs belonging to other PLMNs.<br>
An SGSN provides mobility management of UEs which are moving within an area supported by the mobile radio network. To this end the SGSN is provided with access to a Home Location Register (HLR) 110. The SGSN is arranged to route data packets to Radio Network Controllers (RNC) 112, 114 for communication via the UTRAN radio access facility to mobile users UE 116, 118. The UTRAN radio access facility is provided using Node B apparatus 120,122, 124,126, 128, which effectively form base stations providing radio coverage for the area served by the mobile telecommunications network. The interface 130, 132, 134, 136,138 between each RNC 112,114 and the Node B apparatus 120,122,124,126,128, are labelled lub and<br>
conform to an established or evolving standard. Similarly the interfaces 140, 142 between the SGSN and each RNC 112, 114 are labelled as lu-ps and is an evolving standard.   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
