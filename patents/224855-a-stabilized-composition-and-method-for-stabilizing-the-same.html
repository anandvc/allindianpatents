The bi-cyclic compounds according to the present invention encompass not only the compounds represented by the above formula (I) but also optic isomers, steric isomers, and tautomeric isomers thereof.<br>
It has been known that a bi-cyclic compound having the formula as shown below (Tautomer II) may be in equilibrium with its tautomeric isomer, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin compound(tautomer I)  (USP  5,166,174,<br><br><br>
However,  it has been discovered that in the absence of water, the tautomeric compounds as above  exist predominantly in the form of the bi-cyclic compound.  In aqueous media, it is believed that hydrogen bonding occurs between the water molecule and,  for example, the keto group   at the hydrocarbon chain, thereby hindering bi-cyclic ring formation.  In addition, it is believed that the halogen atom(s) at X, and/or X, promote bi-cyclic ring formation, such as the compound 1 or 2 below.   The bi-cyclic/mono-cyclic structures, for example, may be present<br><br>
in a ratio of 6:1 in D,0; 10:1 in CD3OD-D?0 and 96:4 in CDC13. Accordingly, a preferable embodiment of the present invention is the composition in which the bi-cyclic form is present in ratio of bi-cyclic/mono-cyclic of at least 50:50, preferably 90:10, or even greater to substantially all bi-cyclic compound; 100 % bi-cyclic compound is within this invention.<br>
Preferred embodiment of the compound of the present invention include the Compounds 1 and 2 shown below:<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention possess some pharmacological  activities  such  as bronchodialator.<br>
The above described bi-cyclic compound may<br>
prepared according to the general process set forth below:<br>

the glyceride, each of them may be dissolved in a solvent in which both of them are soluble respectively, and then the solutions may be combined. In this embodiment, the solvent may be removed under vacuum.<br>
According to the present invention, the amount of the glyceride relative to that of the bi-cyclic compound is not limited in so far as the object of the invention, that is, stabilization of the bi-cyclic compound is attained. Generally, 1-5,000,000 parts by weight, preferably, 5-1,000,000 parts by weight, and more preferably, 10-500,000 parts by weight of the glyceride may be employed per one part by weight of the bi-cyclic compound.<br>
The composition of the present invention may comprise the other oil solvent. Examples of the other oil solvents may include mineral oils such as liquid paraffin and light liquid paraffin, tocopherol, and the like.<br>
The ratio of the glycerides to the other oil solvent is not limited. The glycerides may present in an amount that improve at least the stability of the bi-cyclic composition of the present invention. The ratio of the glycerides in total oil solvent is at least lv/v%, preferably not more than 5v/v%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the present invention is substantially free of water.<br><br>
The term "substantially free of water" means that the composition does not contain water that is intentionally added. It is understood that many materials contain water that is taken up from the atmosphere or is present as a coordination complex in its normal state. Water taken up by hygroscopic materials or present as a hydrate is permissibly present in the compositions of this embodiment. According to the embodiment, any water that is present in the composition should not be present in amounts such that the water will have a deleterious effect to the composition of the present invention.<br>
The composition of the present invention may further contain physiologically acceptable additives which do not provide adverse effect to the stability of the compound of the formula (I) . The additives which may be employed in the present invention include, but not limited to, excipients, diluents, fillers, solvents, lubricants, adjuvants, binders, disintegrants, coatings, capuslating agents, ointment bases, suppository base, aerozoles, emulsifiers, dispersing agents, suspensions, viscosity increasing agents, isotonic agents, buffers, analgesic agents, preservatives, anti-oxidants, corrigents, flavors, colorants, and functional agents such as cyclodextrin, biologically degradable polymers. The details of the additives may be selected from those described in any of<br><br>
general textbooks in the pharmaceutical field.   Further the  composition  of the  present  invention may  further contain another pharmaceutical^ active ingredient.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be formulated by a conventional manner. They may be in the form suitable for oral administration, suppository, injection, or topical administration such as eye drops or ointments. Especially, compositions suitable for oral administration such as capsulated compositions and compositions suitable for topical administration such as eye drops are preferable.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail by means of the following examples,  which are illustrated by way of example only and never intended to limit the scope of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1<br>
The above-described compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in the medium chain fatty acid triglyceride (MCT)31 at the amount shown in the table 1 below respectively.  Each of the solutions was placed in a container made of hard glass and stored at 40 'C.  The time-course of the content of the compound 1 and 2 in the solutions were determined by HPLC method.  The medium chain fatty acid triglyceride used herein was a mixture of caprylic acid triglyceride and capric acid triglyceride<br><br>
(85:15).  At the same time, each of the compounds 1 and 2 was placed solely (without being dissolved in the solvent) in the container as above and stored at 40 'C to provide control study.<br>
(1)  Under the absence of the solvent, the content of the compound was determined as follows(HPLC method).<br>
The stored compounds 1 and 2, and standard compounds 1 and 2 were weighed precisely around 0.025g each, and exactly 5 ml aliquots of an internal standard solution were added to the respective weighed compounds. Then the test and standard preparations were obtained by adding acetonitrile (liquid chromatograph grade) to give the precise total amount of 10 ml each.  Each 10/il of the test and standard preparations was loaded on liquid chromatograph and determined the content of the compound by internal standard method with one point calibration curve.<br><br><br>

Column:   A stainless tube having about 5 mm of internal diameter and about 25 cm of length, packed with 5jLxm octadecylsilyl silica gel for liquid chromatograph Column temperature: Stable at around 35'C Mobile phase:  Mixed solution of acetonitrile(liquid chromatograph grade) / aqueous sodium acetate (0.01 mol/1)/glacial acetic acid(800:200:1)<br>
(2)  Under the presence of the solvent, the content of the compound was determined as follows (HPLC method).<br>
Based on the value expressed in the table 1, an amount of the solution corresponding to 36iiq  of the compound 1 or 2 was weighted precisely.  Precisely 1.0 ml of an internal standard solution was added, and then ethyl acetate (liquid chromatograph grade) was added to give the total amount of 10 ml each.  Each 0.1 ml of the solution was vacuum concentrated to dryness to give the test preparation.<br>
Each 18 mg of the respective standard compounds<br><br>
was weighted precisely and admixed with ethyl acetate (liquid chromatograph grade) to give the total amount of exactly 50 ml each.  One (1.0) ml of the solution and 10.0 ml of the internal standard solution were measured precisely and admixed with ethyl acetate (liquid chromatograph grade) to give the total amount of 100 ml each.  Each 0.1 ml of the solution was vacuum concentrated to dryness to give the standard preparation.<br>
To the test and standard preparations, 0.1 ml of fluorescent labeling reagent and 0.85 ml of fluorescent labeling catalyst were added respectively, and the mixture was stirred and reacted at room temperature more than 30 minutes.  0.05 ml aliquots of acetonitrile (liquid chromatograph grade) containing 2% acetic acid were added to the reaction mixtures respectively, stirred and then stand for more than 30 minutes to provide test and standard solutions.<br>
Each 10 ill   of the test and standard solutions was loaded on liquid chromatograph and determined the content of the respective compounds by internal standard method with one point calibration curve.<br><br><br>
