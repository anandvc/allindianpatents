				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
I. FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to tlae efficient operation of a device, and<br>
more particularly, to a system for invoking a privileged function in a device.<br>
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0002] Advances in technology have resulted in the development of a variety of devices<br>
for home, office, and personal use. For example, computer systems, such as desktops,<br>
notebooks, and tablet computers have become powerful tools for use at home or in<br>
office environments. Personal devices, such as wireless telephones, personal digital<br>
assistants (PDAs), and paging devices have also become more powerful and are now<br>
widely used.<br>
[0003] Many devices now comprise complex hardware and software that run operating<br>
systems such as UNIX, LINUX, or similar operating systems. Generally, these<br>
operating systems provide for multiple modes of operation. For example, most systems<br>
provide privileged and non-privileged modes of operation. Programs executing in the<br>
privileged mode of operation are allowed to access memory and system resources<br>
without limitation. Programs executing in the non-privileged mode are restricted from<br>
| | ^ accessing certain memory regions and/or device systems. This configuration provides a<br>
level of protection to important memory or device functions. For example, by executing<br>
third-party applications in the non-privileged mode, important memory regions and<br>
device functions can be protected from unauthorized access. Also, such an arrangement<br>
allows the system to isolate faults during execution.<br>
[0004] However, in some situations, it is desirable to allow privileged mode functions<br>
to be invoked from applications executing in either the privileged or non-privileged<br>
mode. For example, it is desirable for a privileged mode application to have access to<br>
privileged mode fimctions, but it is also desirable for an application executing in the<br>
non-privileged mode to have access to the same privileged functions. For example, it<br>
may be deskable to allow an apphcation to have access to a selected system file, or<br>
device hardware, such as a device modem.<br>
,2<br>
jfcH [0005] Unfortunately, conventional systems utilize a trap to suspend execution of the<br>
non-privileged application while a separate privileged mode "kernel" task performs the<br>
requested operation. As a result, the new privileged mode task results in additional<br>
scheduling complexity and overhead. There may also be additional system delays in the<br>
form of dispatch^ latency. Furthermore, the new task may execute at a different<br>
priority than tibe non-privileged application from which it was invoked, thereby further<br>
complicating system scheduling and operation.<br>
[0006] Therefore, what is needed is a system that provides a way for an application,<br>
executing in either the privileged or non-privileged mode, to invoke a privileged<br>
function to execute within the same task as the application, thereby providing access to<br>
privileged mode hooks to ^pHcations executing under either mode.<br>
# SIMMARY<br>
[0007] In one or more embodiments, a system comprising methods and/or apparatus<br>
operates to provide access to privileged mode hooks from applications executing in<br>
either the privileged or non-privileged mode. For example, in one embodiment, the<br>
system provides a function handler that allows an application nmning in non-privileged<br>
mode to execute privileged mode fimctions within the same task (or execution thread),<br>
thereby avoiding task creation, scheduling, and dispatcher latency. The function<br>
handler is also accessible to privileged apphcations to allow those apphcations to<br>
execute privileged functions. Thus, the system maps well into existing software<br>
because access to privileged mode fimctions can be accomplished without changing die<br>
existing software model.<br>
â€¢^ [0008J In one or more embodiments, the function handler operates to determine whether<br>
a calling application is executing in the privileged or non-privileged mode. If the<br>
calling application is executing in privileged mode, the function handler calls the<br>
privileged fimction directly. If the calling s^plication is executing in non-privileged<br>
mode, the function handler generates an interrupt that is processed by, for example, a<br>
transition system that allows the privileged function to be called within the same task as<br>
the calling non-privileged application. Thus, the fimction handler operates to provide<br>
privileged function hooks to both privileged and non-privileged apphcations.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, the calling application passes a function identifier to the<br>
function handler. The function identifier identifies fimctions that are available for<br>
3<br>
execution. In one embodiment, the function handler determines the fiinction from the<br>
identifier and calls the fiinction directly. In another embodiment, the function handler<br>
generates an interrupt and passes the identifier to the transition system, which uses the<br>
identifier to call the requested function after proper validation. The interrupt may be a<br>
software, hardware, or exception based interrupt.<br>
[0010] In one embodiment, a method is provided that allows an application to invoke a<br>
function on a device, wherein the device includes at least two operating modes<br>
comprising a privileged mode and a non-privileged mode, and the function executes in<br>
the privileged mode. The method comprises receiving a request from the ^phcation to<br>
invoke the fimction and determining the operating mode of the application. The method<br>
also comprises invoking the function usmg an interrupt, if the application is executing in<br>
'^^ the non-privileged mode, wherein the function is executed within the same task as the<br>
application. The method also comprises invoking the function directly, if the<br>
application is executing in the privileged mode.<br>
[0011] In another embodiment, apparatus is provided that allows an ^plication to<br>
invoke a function on a device, wherein the device includes at least two operating modes<br>
comprising a privileged mode and a non-privileged mode, and the fimction executes in<br>
the privileged mode. The apparatus comprises logic that receives a request from the<br>
application to invoke the function. The apparatus also comprises logic that determines<br>
the operating mode of the application. The apparatus also comprises logic to invoke the<br>
function using an interrupt, if the application is executing in the non-privileged mode,<br>
wherein the function is executed within the same task as the application. The apparatus<br>
r ^ also comprises logic to invoke the function directly, if the application is executing in the<br>
privileged mode.<br>
[0012] In another embodiment, apparatus is provided that allows an application to<br>
invoke a fimction on a device, wherein the device includes at least two operating modes<br>
comprising a privileged mode and a non-privileged mode, and the function executes in<br>
the privileged mode. The apparatus comprises means for receiving a request from the<br>
application to invoke the function and means for determining the operating mode of the<br>
application. The apparatus also comprises means for invoking the function using an<br>
interrupt, if the application is executing in the non-privileged mode, wherein the<br>
function is executed within the same task as the application. The apparatus also<br>
4<br>
-. c â€¢<br>
comprises means for invoking the function directly, if the application is executing in the<br>
privileged mode.<br>
[00131 ^ another embodiment, a computer-readable media is provided comprising<br>
instractions, which when executed by a processor in a device, operate to allow an<br>
application to invoke a Amction on a device, wherein the device includes at least two<br>
operating modes comprising a privileged mode and a non-privileged mode, and the<br>
function execute in the privileged mode. The computer-readable media comprises<br>
instructions for receiving a request from the application to invoke the function and<br>
instructions for determining the operating mode of the application. The computerreadable<br>
media also comprises instructions for invoking the fimction using an interrupt,<br>
fS^ if the application is executing in the non-privileged mode, wherein the function is<br>
executed within the same task as the application. The computer readable media also<br>
comprises instructions for invoking the function directly, if the application is executing<br>
in the privileged mode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following detailed description describes a function handler system that<br>
provides privileged function hooks to privileged and non-privileged applications. For<br>
example, the system operates to receive flmction calls from privileged and nonprivileged<br>
applications, after which, the operating mode of the calling application is<br>
determined, and a fast and efQcient transition to the privileged function is provided.<br>
The function executes within the same thread of execution as the calling application.<br>
Thus, the function handler provides privileged function hooks to both privileged and<br>
non-privileged applications, which are then able to call privileged functions without a<br>
new task being generated, thereby avoiding the overhead of new task creation,<br>
^H&gt;, scheduling and dispatcher latency,<br>
[0020] In one or more embodiments, the fVmction handler system interacts with a<br>
nmtime enviromnent (or operating system) executing on the device that is used to<br>
simplify operation of the device, such as by providing generalized calls for device<br>
specific resources. One such runtime environment is the Binary Runtime Btiviromnent<br>
for Wirelessâ„¢ (BREWâ„¢) software platform developed by QUALCOMM, Inc., of San<br>
Diego, CaUfomia. The following description describes a device executing a nmtime<br>
environment, such as the BREW software platform. Ho\Vever, in one or more<br>
embodiments, the registration system is suitable for use with other types of runtune<br>
environments to provide fast and efficient registration of privileged function hooks in a<br>
variety of devices, including generating systems or other controlling or monitoring<br>
programs. For example, the devices may include, but are not limited to, desktop<br>
^ ^ computers, notebook computers, handheld computers, and portable devices, such as<br>
wireless telephones, pagers, PDAs, email devices, tablet computers, or other type of<br>
computing devices.<br>
[0021] FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a function handler system 100 that provides<br>
privileged function hooks to privileged and non-privileged applications executing on a<br>
device 102. The system 100 may be part of a home computer, office computer, or<br>
personal device, such as a wireless telephone or PDA, or any other type of computing<br>
device. During operation, one or more applications execute on the device 102 and<br>
operate to provide information, functions, and/or services to the device 102. For<br>
example, one type of application may be a viewer q)phcation that operates to allow the<br>
device 102 to display movies, news, or other types of multimedia content<br>
6<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, the device 102 includes a runtime environment 104 (i.e.,<br>
BREW) that provides at least two modes of operation; namely a non-privileged mode<br>
(NP) and a privileged mode (P). The non-privilege mode of operation is used to restrict<br>
the access of applications running on the device and to provide fault detection. For<br>
example, Â£q[}plications running in non-privileged mode are restricted to selected memory<br>
regions and may be denied access to device registers or other resources. The privileged<br>
mode of operation allows appUcations running under this mode to access memory or<br>
device resources without limitation.<br>
[0023] When an application executes on the device 102, it runs imder the runtime<br>
environment to provide the desired functionality. For example, the application 106 runs<br>
on the device 102 under the non-privileged mode (NP), and the application 108 runs on<br>
flie device 102 in the privileged mode (P). Either of these applications may require<br>
functions or system services that are available through a privileged function 110. For<br>
example, the {^plications may need to access privileged memory or device hardware<br>
resources. To obtain these fimctions or services, the fimction handler system 100<br>
provides a mechanism that allows either application (106, 108) to call the privileged<br>
fimction through a function handler 112. When called through the function handler 112,<br>
the function 110 executes within the same thread of execution as the calling application.<br>
After the function 110 performs the requested service, program control returns to the<br>
calling application.<br>
[0024] As a result, the fimction handler system 100 provides a fast and efficient<br>
mechanism to allow privileged and non-privileged applications to perform privileged<br>
's' fimctions without the need for a new task to be created and scheduled for execution by<br>
the runtime environment, thereby eliminating scheduler complexity and associated<br>
dispatcher latency.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 shows a detailed block diagram of the device 102 con^rising one<br>
embodiment of a function handler system. The device 102 comprises processing logic<br>
202 and device resources 206 that are coupled to an internal data bus 204. The device<br>
^resources 206 comprise hardware, software, memory, logic, or other resources that<br>
allow the device to interface to various internal and external resomrces, devices, or<br>
systems. Also coupled to the processing logic 202 are code memory 208 and data<br>
memory 210.<br>
7<br>
c<br>
[0026] In one or more embodiments, the processing logic 202 comprises a CPU,<br>
processor, gate array, hardware logic, memory elements, virtual machine, software, I/O<br>
interfaces, and/or any combination of hardware and software. Thus, the processing<br>
logic 202 generally comprises logic to execute machine-readable instructions. For<br>
example, instructions may be loaded into the device 102 from a con[^)uter-readable<br>
media, such as a floppy disk, CDROM, Flash memory, or other computer-readable<br>
media that interfaces to the device 102 via the device resources 206. In another<br>
embodiment, the instructions may be downloaded into the device 102 from a network<br>
resource, such as a network server or any other type of network resource that interfaces<br>
to the device 102 via the device resources 206. The instructions, when executed by the<br>
_- processing logic 202, provide one or more embodiments of a ftmction handler system as<br>
described herein.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, code memory 208 comprises RAM, ROM, FLASH,<br>
EEROM, or any other suitable type of memory, or a combination thereof. The code<br>
memory 206 is partitioned into a privileged region (?) 212 and a non-privileged region<br>
(NP) 214 through the operation of a memory management imit 216. The MMU 216<br>
operates to restrict the operation of non-privileged program code so that non-privileged<br>
code has limited access rights to selected regions of the code memory 208.<br>
[0028] The privileged region 212 includes program code that when executed has<br>
unrestricted access to the memory or other systans of the device 102. For example, the<br>
privileged code region 212 comprises operating system code (OS), user interface code<br>
(UI), validation code, q)plication code (A^p-P) 108 and privileged fimction code<br>
w FUNC 110. Thecodeshownintheprivilegedcoderegion212 is representative of the<br>
types of privileged code that may be included in the device 102. It is also possible that<br>
the privileged code region 212 includes other types of privileged code for execution on<br>
the device 102.<br>
[0029] The non-privileged code region 214 includes program code that when executed<br>
is restricted to accessing only selected memory regions. For example, the nonprivileged<br>
code region 214 comprises OS code and application code (App-NP) 106, and<br>
the fimction handler 106. fa one or more embodiments, the FH106 may be downloaded<br>
to the device 102 from a network or system, installed at device manufacture, or added to<br>
the device from a computer-readable media.<br>
8<br>
[0030] In one embodiment, data memory 210 comprises a privileged region 216 and a<br>
non-privileged region 218. The privileged region 226 comprises data regions that may<br>
be accessed only by privileged program code. For example, the privileged data region<br>
216 comprises data used by the OS, UI, validation, App-P and FUNC code. The nonprivileged<br>
data region 218 includes data regions that may be accessed by non-privileged<br>
program code. For example, the non-privileged data region 218 comprises data used by<br>
the non-privileged OS, App-NP, and FH program code. Also coupled to the data<br>
memory 210 is a memory management unit (MMU) 220. The MMU 220 operates to<br>
restrict access to the non-privileged and privileged data regions. For example, a non-<br>
4 ^ privileged appUcation is restricted from accessing data in the privileged data region 216,<br>
or data belonging to other non-privileged applications in the non-privileged data region<br>
218.<br>
[0031] The processing logic 202 also comprises mode logic 222 and intermpt logic 224.<br>
The mode logic 222 comprises a CPU, processor, logic, device registers, software, or<br>
any combination of hardware and software that operates to allow a mode change<br>
between operating modes of the device 102. For example, in one embodiment, the<br>
mode logic 222 comprises a register whose bits set the operating mode. For example, to<br>
switch from privileged mode to non-privileged mode, selected bits in the register are<br>
set, which results in a non-privileged stack being restored and program execution<br>
continuing in the non-privileged mode.<br>
,.^,&gt;, [0032] The intermpt logic 224 comprises a CPU, processor, logic, software, or any<br>
combination of hardware and software that operates to allow an interrupt to be received<br>
and processed by the processmg logic 202, For example, the interrupt logic 224 may<br>
receive a software intenupt that is generated by program code executed by the<br>
processing logic 202. hi one embodiment, the frmction handler system uses the<br>
software interrupt to allow non-privileged program code to execute a privileged<br>
fimction within the same task and priority. In one embodiment, the intermpt logic 224<br>
-^ processes software intermpts, hardware interrupts, program exceptions, or any other<br>
type of intenupt as part of the operation of the fimction handler system.<br>
[0033] It should be noted that the configuration of the device 102 is just one suitable<br>
configuration for implementing the described fimction handler system. It is also<br>
possible to implement one or more embodiments of the fimction handler system using<br>
9<br>
other device configurations, functional elements or element configurations within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0034] During operation of the device 102, the processing logic 202 executes nonprivileged<br>
^plication code (i.fc., App-NP) and/or privileged qiplication code (App-P).<br>
When eifh&amp;c application requires the services of a privileged function, such as Func 110,<br>
the respective ^)plication calls the FH code 112 wifli an identifier that identifies the<br>
desired fimction (i.e., Func). The FH code 112 is non-priAdleged code, and so it may be<br>
called from either privileged or non-privileged applications.<br>
[0035] The FH code determines the operating mode of the calling application, and<br>
based on the determined mode, executes selected procedures to call the privileged<br>
fimction Func to provide the requested services without creating a new task. The<br>
following is a summary of the procedures used by the FH 112 to respond to a request<br>
for the services of a privileged fimction.<br>
1. Receive a request from an application to execute a fimction associated with an<br>
identifier that is passed with the request.<br>
2. Determine the operating mode of the requesting application.<br>
3. If the requesting application is executing in the privileged operating mode, then:<br>
a. Look iqj the requested privileged fimction based on the identifier.<br>
b. Call the privileged fimction.<br>
c. Return to the calling privileged application.<br>
4. If the requesting q)plication is executing in the non-privileged operating mode,<br>
"mi then:<br>
a. Generate a software interrupt and pass the identifier.<br>
b. Transition to a privileged mode interrupt handler.<br>
c. Look \xp the requested privileged fimction based on the identifier.<br>
d. Call the privileged fimction.<br>
e. After the privileged fimction executes, restore the non-privileged<br>
registers<br>
f. Return to the calling non-privileged application.<br>
[0036] In one embodiment, the described fimction handler system comprises program<br>
instiiictions stored on a computer-readable media, which when executed by the<br>
10,<br>
c<br>
processing logic 202, provides the functions described herein. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the computer-readable media comprises a floppy disk, CD, memory card,<br>
FLASH memory device, RAM, ROM, or any other type of memory device.<br>
[0037] FIG, 3 shows a flow diagram 300 that illustrates the operation of one<br>
embodiment of a function handler system for use in a device, for example the device<br>
102. For clarity, the flow diagram 300 will be described with reference to the device<br>
shown in FIG. 2. It will be assumed that the device is executing a BREW runtime<br>
environment that operates to create a thread of execution 302. The execution thread 302<br>
represents the execution of privileged or non-privileged appUcations on the device.<br>
[0038] A system scheduler (not shown) operates to schedule the execution of<br>
^ applications to form the thread of execution 302. Typically, the scheduler operates to<br>
schedule execution based on priority, but may operate to schedule execution based on<br>
other criteria. However, the function handler system described herein provides a<br>
fimction handler that operates within the same thread of execution as a calling<br>
appUcation, thereby avoiding new task creation, associated scheduler complexity, and<br>
possible dispatcher latency.<br>
[0039] The thread of execution 302 represents the execution of either the privileged<br>
appUcation (App-P) or the non-privileged apphcation (App-NP). The executing<br>
appUcation may be a viewer appUcation that allows the device to display various<br>
multimedia content to the device user. As the appUcation executes, a requirement for<br>
the services of a privileged function (Fimc) occm-s. To obtain services from the<br>
,,7^ privileged function, the application calls the FH 304 and passes an identifier that<br>
identifies the privileged function Func. It wiU be assimied that privileged functions<br>
available in the system have an associated identifier that can be discovered by the<br>
executing application. In one or more embodiments, the following functions are<br>
performed by the processing lo^c 202 executing program instructions stored in the code<br>
memoiy 208, which may also process data in the data memory 210.<br>
[0040] At block 306, the FH 304 obtains the identifier that identifies the privileged<br>
-junction Func. For example, the identifier may be passed to the FH in a register<br>
associated with the processing logic 202 or other memory location in the data memory<br>
210.<br>
[0041] At block 308, a test is performed to determine if the calUng application is<br>
executing in the privileged or non-privileged mode. For example, the processing logic<br>
11<br>
determines the current processing mode of the ^plication by evaluating the processor<br>
status registers. If the calUng appUcation is executing in the non-privileged mode, the<br>
method proceeds to block 310. If tibe calling application is executing in the privileged<br>
mode, the method proceeds to block 312.<br>
[0042] At block 312, it has been determined that the ^plication is executing in the<br>
privileged mode. Tlie FH code 304 looks up the requested privileged fimction (i.e.,<br>
Func) based on the received identifier. For example, the processing logic 202 uses the<br>
identifier to access a data structure that maps available functions to identifiers to<br>
detemiine the function being requested by the calling application. The data structure<br>
may be stored in the data memory 210.<br>
[0043] At block 314, the privileged Amotion Func is called to perform the requested<br>
"" service. For example, the privileged Amotion may access a system file or a hardware<br>
resource. In one embodiment, the processing logic executes program instructions to call<br>
the privileged function Func. Upon execution, the function Func may also perform<br>
various parameters checks and validations to verify that the calling application has<br>
passed legal and vaUd parameters. Once the fimction Func has completed executing,<br>
program flow returns to the thread of execution 302.<br>
[0044] Therefore, if a privileged application calls the fimction Func through the FH<br>
304, the FH 304 operates to detennine the requested function, based on the identifier,<br>
and call that function to perform the requested service. If a non-privileged appUcation<br>
calls the fimction Func through the FH 304, the FH 304 operates as follows to provide<br>
tiie requested service.<br>
^^ [0045] At block 310, the FH 304 generates an intexiupt that operates to request that the<br>
operating mode of the device to transition to tiie privileged mode 316 so that the<br>
privileged fimction Func can acecute. The interrupt may be a software internq)t or any<br>
other type of interrupt that may be generated by the FH 304. The interrupt includes the<br>
identifier passed fix)m the calling application. For example, the interrupt may be<br>
generated and/or processed by intemipt logic 224 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0046] After the interrupt is generated, program execution flows to privileged mode<br>
- â€¢ I<br>
program code 316 where the privileged function Func is call within the same task as the<br>
calling application.<br>
[0047] A brief description of the operation of program code 316 is provided below.<br>
However, for a more detailed description of the operation of the program code 316, the<br>
12<br>
c.<br>
reader is referred to U.S. Patent Application entitled "SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING<br>
TRANSITIONS BETWEEN OPERATING MODES OF A DEVICE" having Attorney Docket No.<br>
030620, which is incorporated by referaice herein.<br>
[0048] After a switch to a privileged mode stack occurs and validation of the passed<br>
function identifier, the program execution flows to block 318.<br>
[0049] At block 318, the desired privileged function is determined based on the passed<br>
identifier. For example, a data structure stored in the data memory 210 is search by the<br>
processing logic 202 based on the identifier to identify the desu-ed function Func.<br>
[0050] At block 320, once the privileged function Func is determined, it is called. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, the processing logic 202 executes instructions stored in<br>
"^ the code memory 208 to call the function Func. The privileged function may operate to<br>
open a particular system file that contains data for use by the calling non-privileged<br>
appUcation. hi one embodiment, additional parameters are passed to the privileged<br>
function fi-om the application. For example, the parameters may further indicate or<br>
define the type of service being requested by the non-privileged application. The<br>
privileged function operates to validate these parameters to verify that execution of the<br>
privileged function will not exceed the privileges granted to the application. For<br>
example, the function operates to validate the parameters so that execution of the<br>
fiinction will not exceed memory restrictions placed on the application.<br>
[0051] At block 322, after the function Func is performed, the non-privileged mode<br>
registers are restored, including the non-privileged mode stack. The program execution<br>
'^â‚¬$ retums to the non-privileged amplication thread 302 as shown at path 324.<br>
[0052] It should be noted that the program flow diagram 300 illustrates just one<br>
embodiment and that changes, additions, or rearrangements of the program elements<br>
may be made without deviating from the scope of the invention.<br>
[0053] Accordingly, while one or more embodiments of methods and apparatus for a<br>
function handler system have been illustrated and described herein, it will be<br>
appreciated that various changes can be made to the embodiments without departing<br>
from their spirit or essential characteristics. Therefore, the disclosures and descriptions<br>
herein are intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the invention,<br>
which is set forth in the following claims.<br>
