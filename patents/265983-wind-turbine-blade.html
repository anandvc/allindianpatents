				<td>WIND TURBINE BLADE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a wind turbine comprising a wind turbine blade with a particular profile and airfoil design. More particularly, the invention relates to a wind turbine comprising a wind turbine blade with a relatively low radius specific solidity, which varies as a function of the distance from the turbine blade root.<br>
The invention is mainly directed towards pitch regulated wind turbines, which are operated at variable rotor speed, and has blades longer than about 30 meters,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A wind turbine blade cross section is typically referred to as a blade profiie. The shape of the profile varies with the distance from the blade root. The blade is connected to the hub that is placed in the rotor centre. The profile has a chord, c, and a thickness, t, as shown in Fig. 1 The size of the chord and the thickness as well as the thickness to chord ratio varies as a function of the radius, r, i.e. the distance from the rotor centre to the blade cross section.<br>
In principle, a wind turbine blade consists of a plurality of connected biade profiles. The blade and hence the individual profiles are rotated relative to the rotor plane during operation. The incoming wind is about orthogonal to the rotor plane, but since the blade is in motion, the effective angle and speed of the incoming wind (i.e. corresponding to a steady blade) depend on the speed of rotation of the blade. The effective angle is also referred to as the angle of attack, a, as shown in Fig. 2. The effective wind speed that the profiles see is also referred to as the relative wind speed, w, as shown in Fig. 2<br>
The response of the aerodynamic profile of the blade to incoming wind may be separated into a lift component orthogonal to the effective incoming wind and a drag component that are in parallel to the effective incoming wind. The size of the components may be expressed as the lift coefficient, Cu, and the drag coefficient, CDl<br><br>
respectively, as indicated in Fig. 2. In general, it is desired to have a high lift coefficient and a low drag coefficient.<br>
In pitch regulated wind turbines with variable rotor speed, the variation of the angle of attack, a, due to variation in wind speed is compensated by rotating the individual blades about a longitudinal axis, called pitching, and by controlling the rotor speed. Thereby the average angle of attack may be kept close to a desired value with regard to the average wind speed,<br>
CL - CD plot<br>
The lift coefficient corresponding to the value at the maximum ratio of CL / CD is referred to as the design lift coefficient, Cl.d- The design lift coefficient is found as CL corresponding to the tangent to the CL - Cd-curve through (0,0) in a CL- CD plot, as show In Fig. 3. Typically each blade cross section is twisted slightly about the pitch axis so that each profile is operating at an angle of attack that corresponds to the design lift coefficient, CLd for incoming wind speeds in the interval of 7 - 11 m/s.<br>
GI - a plot<br>
In Fig. 4, the lift coefficient CL is plotted as a function of the angle of attack, a, It is observed that CL increases as the angle of attack is increased until asian, above which the blade begins to stall The maximum lift coefficient,CL.max. corresponds to the lift coefficient at ,CL.max The maximum lift coefficient, ,CL.max varies as a function of the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number Is defined as;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Where w is the relative wind speed and v is the kinematic viscosity of air. The maximum lift coefficient, CLroa!t, also varies as a function of the roughness of the profile surface particularly on the leading edge. The values of lift coefficients mentioned in the present document refer to profiles with a smooth surface subjected to a two-dimensional airflow,<br>
The angle of attack corresponding to Cm is referred to as the design angle of attack, a<j and may be identified from a set of cl cd plot corresponding as indicated in fig. it is the genera perception art that wind turbine should operated at or near design lift coefficient cm to reduce drag prevent blade stalling accidentally. other words cuoperaibn="CL."></j><br>
αoperation= αd, where αoperation and CL.0peration. respectively, are the mean angle of attack and the corresponding mean lift coefficient during operation.<br>
Gusts of wind<br>
The pitch regulation is not sufficiently fast to respond to Individual gusts of wind. Therefore, the instant angle of attack, agus!, upon a gust of wind is shifted to a larger angle of attack than the intended aopBration- Wind turbine blade profiles are therefore traditionally designed such thai the design angle of attack, αd, as derived from Cud is substantially lower than αstall. as thfs prevents the blade from accidental stalling and hence increases the tolerance towards gusts of wind.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide an improved wind turbine blade.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solidity<br>
The solidity of a wind turbine blade is the ratio between the area of the wind turbine blade projected into the rotor plane and the tola! area covered by the rotating bfades, Ablade. The combined solidity, Le. the sum of solidities of the blades, Is hence:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where n is the number of wind turbine blades, e.g, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and R is the rotor radius. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, n is 3. The solidity is therefore a measure of the slimness of the blade in that the lower the solidity, the more slim the blades. When comparing the wind turbines in Fig. 5 and Fig, 6, It is evident that the blades in Fig. 5 have a larger solidity than the blades in Fig. 6,<br>
Solidity may also be established for a specific radius, r, from the rotor center The radius specific solidity of the wind turbine blade is given by:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where cr is the chord at the specific radius. It should be observed that the radius specific solidity in general is independent on purely linear scaling of the blade except near the tip and near the root of the blade where structural considerations determines the solidity<br>
The improvement according to the above object of the invention is realised by a wind turbine operable by pitch regulation and variable rotor speed, having at least one wind turbine blade longer than 30 meters. The combined radius specific soiidity of the blades is relatively low and the maximum lift coefficient, Ctrnax, is relatively high. Preferably Solr  1 5 for at least 80 radius-% of the blade, preferably for at least 90 radius-% of the blade. CL.max  should be considered for a Reynolds number, Re = 3.0x10B, and for a two-dimensional flow and a smooth profile surface.<br>
The improvement may for example result in one or more of reduced extreme- and/or fatigue loads for substantially the same power production, improved durability of the blades and/or other structural or electrical components of the wind turbine, reduced weight of the blade and/or material consumption for manufacturing of the blade, and/or reduced weight and/or material consumption for manufacturing of other structural or electrical components of the wind turbine. However, other advantages would be realised by the skilled person when faced with one or more of the aspects of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will  be explained more fully below with reference to exemplary embodiments as well as the drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a profile of a wind turbine blade,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a profile with incoming wind,<br>
Fig 3 shows a CL - CD plot,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a CL. - a plot,<br>
Fig. 5 shows a wind turbine with high solidity blades,<br>
Fig. 6 shows a wind turbine with low solidity blades, and<br>
Fig, 7 shows a plot of a combined radius specific solidity for a preferred embodiment.<br>
All the figures are highly schematic and not necessarily to scale, and they show only parts which are necessary in order to elucidate the invention, other parts being omitted or merely suggested.<br>
DISCUSSION<br>
By radius-% is herein meant a fraction of the blade corresponding to the same percentage of the longitudinal length of the blade. The fraction need not be one continuous part but may be made up by several parts of the profile. For example, a 50 radius-% corresponds to 25m of a blade when the rotor diameter is 50m, and the 50 radius-% may eg. be made up by 5 meters of the blade root in combination with the outermost 5 meters of the blade tip and 15 meters around the middle of the blade.<br>
Conditions near the blade root<br>
The airfoil at the root section of the blade is mainly dictated by structural considerations., This is acceptable as this section only covers a minor part of the overall power production. This invention Is therefore primarily directed towards the outermost 30% - 95% of the blade, whereas the considerations may in some cases similarly be applied to the root section.<br>
Conditions near the blade tip<br>
The airfoil at the tip section, that Is the outermost 95 % -100 % of the blade, is mainly<br>
dictated by getting the blade smoothly stopped while stilt maintaining the combination<br>
of low noise from the section and as high performance as possible. The shape of the tip section Is important as tip vortices generate noise that can be dominant if noise issues are not taken properly into account during the design of the tip section,<br>
Fatigue and extreme<br>
An important issue in design of wind turbine blades is the resistance towards fatigue damage. In general, the fatigue is driven by the chord size, i.e, the larger the chord, the higher fatigue loads on the blade. Furthermore, the vibrations arising if the blade stalls also increase the fatigue damage. It fs therefore a considerable advantage of the present invention that despite the blade Is operated with a higher design angle of attack, a,), the fatigue characteristic of the blade is improved.<br>
Extreme wind gusts with wind speeds up to 70 m/s generate extreme loads on the wind turbine. During extreme wind speeds, the wind turbine rotor is idling, that is rotating slowly or stopped with the blades in stop position and with no power production. The extreme loads are driven by the chord size, i.e. the larger the chord, the higher the extreme loads, it is therefore also a considerable advantage of the present invention that extreme loads are reduced.<br>
Wind turbine blades with low solidity and high CL.max <br>
As wind turbines and wind turbine blades increase in size, iight and stiff materials In the blades are needed to reduce the blade weight while still maintain a stiffness that is sufficient to prevent the blades from hitting the tower during gusty winds. Furthermore, the use of slender blades increases the need for materials with a high strength as both the chord and thickness of the blade in the different cross sections must be kept below certain values. Carbon fibres have proved to promote these properties. The amount of needed carbon fibres in the blades increases with the blade length. For slender blades larger than 30 m, the need for carbon fibres begins to exist. Hence there is a close connection between the use of slender blades larger than 30 m and the use of carbon fibres..<br>
The induction, a, is a measure of the speed reduction of the wind upon passage of the wind turbine, Typically the induction should be about 0 33 for optima! operation. The induction of an airfoil increases with the chord size, c, and the lift coefficient, CL of the airfoil. An increase in CL.d therefore allows for a corresponding decrease in chord size and hence a lower solidity of the blade.. It has been found that a suitable combination<br>
of an increase in CL.d with a decrease in solidity leads to reduced fatigue and extreme loads for substantially the same power production- The reduced loads result in cheaper components in the wind turbine and therefore an overall improved economy for the wind turbine.<br>
Extreme loads but especially fatigue loads can be reduced by using a regulation strategy that pitches each blade individually during one rotor rotation. The main purpose of the individual pitch control is to reduce the fluctuations and/or cyclic variations'in angle of attacks during one rotor rotation and due to that reduce the load variations. Fluctuations and/or cyclic variations in angle of attacks can occur from positive- and/or negative wind shear, yaw errors, wind turbines in wake or half wake of each other, local turbulence bubbles in the rotor plane, etc. As an example a situation with positive wind shear and a constant pitch angle results in higher angle of attacks when a blade is pointing upwards compared to when it is pointing downwards. This is because the wfnd speed in this situation is higher in the top of the rotor plane compared to in the bottom. By introducing a cyclic pitch angle variation during one rotor rotation, the load variations due to positive wind shear can be removed. Individual pitch control is only effective if the blade is kept away from the stall area, I.e. operating tn the linear part of the CL{O) curve on Fig. 4. It was realised by the inventor that the combination of high lift profiles, operation away from stall, and the use of individual pitch control lead to surprisingly large load reductions - particularly with regard to fatigue loads. The load reduction results in improved freedom to design the blade as well as an overall improved wind turbine economy.<br>
The wind turbines and the blades according to the present invention are particularly durable with regard to fatigue and extreme loads, and surprisingly it has been found that for blades which combines low solidity and high lift the improved durability against fatigue and extreme loads may be achieved without significant decrease in the annular yield of the wind turbine.<br>
Noise<br>
It is important that noise from wind turbines in genera! is reduced as much as possible as neighbours close to wind turbines can be disturbed by the noise. On many wind turbine sites there are specific demands on the maximum noise level that the wind turbines create. Sometimes there are different demands on the maximum noise level at different hours during the day and night. The noise level coming from a wind turbine<br>
that are pitch regulated with variable rotor speed can be reduced by reducing the rotor speed and/or change the pitch angles. When the rotor speed is decreased, the angle of attack must be increased to achieve constant energy production. This results in operation much closer to stall, which is generally not desired. Surprisingly it has been found that by using profiles with high CL,max, it is possible to reduce the wind turbine noise substantially with only a relatively small reduction in the power production. Furthermore, this may be realised without getting as close to stall as with conventional blades.<br>
Table 1 shows the percentage difference in annual yield at a mean wind speed of 8 m/s for different maximum sound power levels vaiid for a wind turbine with high lift profile blades and standard profile blades, respectively. Mode 0 corresponds to an operation based on maximum power production. Mode 3 and mode 5 correspond to operation with reduced rotor speed corresponding to reduced noise levels. It is seen that mode 0 results In a maximum sound power level of 105 dB(A), while mode 3 and mode 5 correspond to maximum sound power levels of 103 dB(A) and 100 dB(A), respectively.<br>
Table 1. Difference in annual yield at different sound power levels.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Comparing the results in table 1, it Is evident that a wind turbine blade with high lift profile generates more power for the same sound power level In the noise-reduced operating modes. For the example in table 1, the reduction of annual yield is about 50% larger for the standard profile blade compared to the blade with high lift profiles. Computer modelling has shown that typically the reduction of annual yields for the standard profiles are around 25% to 75% larger than for the high lift profiles according to the present invention. High lift profiles with low solidity as discussed above are particularly advantageous as they combine the option of low nofse operation with superior fatigue behaviour and hence allow for much more flexible design and operation.<br>
The noise-reduced operation involves reducing the rotation speed of the rotor and adjusting the pitch angle so that the decrease in annual yield is minimised. This can be realised much more efficiently for high lift profiles than for standard profiles.<br>
It should be observed that the blades according to the present invention may also be applied for stall regulated wind turbines A stall regulated wind turbine with blades according to the present invention also exhibit superior durability with regard to fatigue and extreme loads.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example A1<br>
Wind turbine blades covered by the invention may be manufactured by conventional means well known in the field. However, it is advantageous that the blades include carbon fibre based reinforcement, and preferably the carbon fibres are introduced in the blade as pultruded or belt pressed cured members, as this supports the increased freedom to design wind turbine blades realised by the present invention to realise even better blades. <br>
Example A2<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a wind turbine, which may be operated by pitch regulation and variable rotor speed, has at least one wind turbine blade longer than 30 meters, such as three blades of about 50 meters., The combined radius specific solidity of the blades is below a linear interpolation between<br>
•	Solr = 0,035 at blade radius r» 30% of the rotor radius R<br>
•	Solr = 0-025 at blade radius r = 50% of the rotor radius R<br>
•	So!r = 0.018 at blade radius r = 70% of the rotor radius R<br>
•	Solr = 0.011 at blade radius r = 90% of the rotor radius R<br>
for at least 50 radius-% of the blade(s) between blade radius r = 30 - 90% of the rotor radius R. In Fig. 7, the upper plecewise linear line corresponds to such linear interpolation In other words, if the combined radius specific solidity of the blades for the wind turbine according to this embodiment is drawn on the plot of Fig. 7, then the plot corresponding to the wind turbine according to this embodiment is below the lower curve in at least half of the Interval between blade radius r ~ 30 •• 90% of the rotor radius R.. The part of the plot corresponding to the wind turbine according to this<br>
embodiment, which part is under the line of Fig. 7, may be made up by several pieces of which are connected by pieces, which are above the line of Fig. 7.<br>
Since it is advantageous to have a larger fraction of the blade below the line of Fig. 7, a preferably variant of this embodiment is when at least 75 radius-% of the blade(s) between blade radius r = 30 - 90% of the rotor radius R, and even more preferably at least 95 radius-% of the blade(s) between blade radius r - 30 - 90% of the rotor radius R.<br>

Example E<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the combined radius specific solidity for a wind turbine corresponding to any one of the above examples decreases substantially linearly over a substantial lengthwise part of the blade. By substantially linearly is meant that the combined radius specific solidity derives from linearity by less than 2% of the radius specific solidity, preferably less than 1% of the radius specific solidity. In one embodiment, the combined radius specific solidity decreases substantially linearly between radius r = 60% of the rotor radius R to r = 80% of R. In a preferred embodiment, the substantially linear decrease Is from about r = 50% of R to about r = 90% of R. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the substantially linear decrease is from about r = 40% of R to about r = 90% of R. The substantially linear decrease is advantageous in that it allows for a simple design and arrangement of reinforcement since the momentum of such a blade typically also varies linearly.<br>
