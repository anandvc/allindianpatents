				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to the field of luminaires and<br>
more particularly to a flat discharge lamp that can be<br>
used as a decorative or architectural luminaire.<br>
Flat lamps, such as those used for the manufacture of<br>
backlit screen devices, may be formed from two glass<br>
sheets held slightly apart, generally by less than a<br>
few millimeters, and hermetically sealed so as to<br>
contain a gas at reduced pressure, in which an<br>
electrical discharge produces radiation generally in<br>
the ultraviolet range that excites a phosphor<br>
substance, that then emits visible light.<br>
In a standard structure, a glass sheet has, on one and<br>
the same face, two screen-printed coatings, especially<br>
made of silver, in the form of interpenetrating combs<br>
that constitute a cathode and an anode. This face is<br>
turned toward the space containing the plasma gas.<br>
Another glass sheet is kept at a certain distance from<br>
the first one by means of discrete spacers and<br>
optionally by a peripheral frame. Generated between the<br>
anode and the cathode is what is called a coplanar<br>
discharge, that is to say one in a direction hugging<br>
the main surface of the glass substrate, which<br>
discharge excites the surrounding plasma gas. The<br>
electrodes are protected by a dielectric coating<br>
designed to avoid, by capacitive limitation a loss of<br>
material of the electrodes by ion bombardment in the<br>
vicinity of the glass substrate. At least one of the<br>
glass substrate faces turned toward the space<br>
containing the gas furthermore carries a coating of<br>
phosphor material.<br>
This coplanar discharge lamp structure, whose function<br>
is to provide maximum light power with a very thin<br>
device, proves to be very complex. Its high cost means<br><br>
that it is intended only for high added-value<br>
applications. „<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION <br>
The object of the present	invention is to propose a<br>
flat illuminating element	capable of offering novel<br>
possibilities in terms of	decoration, display and/or<br>
architecture.<br>
In this regard, the subject of the invention is a flat<br>
lamp comprising at least two glass substrates kept<br>
mutually parallel and defined in an.internal gas-filled<br>
space, comprising two electrodes associated<br>
respectively with the two glass substrates and away<br>
from the internal space, in which the internal face of<br>
at least one substrate turned toward said internal<br>
space is coated with a phosphor material, characterized<br>
in that at least one of the electrodes is covered with<br>
at least one preferably transparent electrical<br>
insulation that may be formed by at least one of the<br>
glass substrates or be associated with at least one of<br>
the glass substrates.<br>
The electrical, preferably transparent, insulation thus<br>
allows the electrodes to be electrically isolated from<br>
the outside for safety of the public.<br>
According to one embodiment, at least one electrode is<br>
affixed to the surface of the external face of the<br>
substrate with which it is associated and is covered<br>
with at least one electrical insulation, the electrode<br>
being incorporated into the surface of the glass<br>
substrate or of the electrical insulation.<br>
According to another embodiment, at least one electrode<br>
is incorporated into the electrical insulating<br>
material, either within its very thickness or on the<br>
surface.<br><br>
According to these embodiments, this electrical<br>
insulation is made of glass or of a transparent plastic<br>
such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB), ethylene/vinyl acetate<br>
(EVA) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the electrical<br>
insulation is formed by the glass substrate as such,<br>
the electrode being incorporated into its thickness.<br>
One or more other additional, preferably transparent,<br>
electrical insulations, made of glass or of any other<br>
material such as a plastic (PVB, PET EVA) that may also<br>
have other functionalities, for example for providing<br>
an optical effect, especially a colored effect, a<br>
decorative effect, produced by screen printing or<br>
otherwise, with a structured relief, a delustered<br>
effect, or with a scattering layer, etc., may be joined<br>
to this electrical insulation as formed, depending on<br>
the various embodiments.<br>
Thus, joining one or more electrical insulations to the<br>
glass substrate(s) of the lamp makes it possible, apart<br>
from protecting the electrodes, to produce decorative<br>
or illuminating objects incorporating decorative plates<br>
that present flat decorations, for example photographs,<br>
screen printing, enameled decorations, etc.<br>
In particular, an additional electrical insulation is<br>
also formed by another glass substrate that is<br>
laminated to at least one of the glass substrates<br>
constituting the lamp via an intermediate plastic film<br>
or other material, especially a resin, that can make<br>
the two substrates adhere to each other.<br>
According to another feature, the second electrode is<br>
joined in the same way as the first electrode or<br>
according to an alternative embodiment given above.<br><br>
This structure, by placing the electrodes on the<br>
outside of the enclosure containing the plasma gas at<br>
reduced pressure, allows the manufacturing cost of the<br>
lamp to be considerably lowered, with illumination<br>
characteristics well suited to the use as a luminaire.<br>
In this configuration, the glass substrate acts as<br>
capacitive protection for the electrodes against ion<br>
bombardment.<br>
Furthermore, the problem of connection to the power<br>
supply is solved much more simply than in the case of<br>
the known systems in which the electrical connectors<br>
must pass through the hermetically sealed enclosure<br>
containing the gas.<br>
The term "translucent element" is understood to mean an<br>
element whose constituent material is translucent or<br>
transparent, but also elements made of a material that<br>
can absorb a substantial fraction of the light<br>
radiation but is distributed with respect to the<br>
surface of the substrate in a pattern such that all the<br>
light radiation emitted by the lamp is altered very<br>
little by the element. Such generally translucent<br>
elements may be formed by a grid, an array of wires, an<br>
etched or screen-printed coating, etc.<br>
Preferably, an electrode that can be used in the<br>
invention is in the form of a transparent or<br>
translucent conductive coating deposited directly on<br>
the substrate by standard thin-film deposition, by<br>
etching or by screen printing. In particular, the<br>
electrode is a continuous conductive coating, that is<br>
to say one that entirely covers large areas of the<br>
surface of the substrate.<br>
Advantageously, the two electrodes are continuous<br>
conductive coatings each located on the external face<br>
side of a substrate and at least partly covering the<br><br>
facing surfaces of said substrates. Preferably, the two<br>
electrodes are transparent coatings.<br>
The continuous and the uniform coatings forming the<br>
electrodes may be manufactured on large substrates by<br>
methods of very high productivity.<br>
The continuous coatings may cover all or part of the<br>
external faces facing the glass substrates. It is<br>
possible to provide only certain areas of the external<br>
surface of one or the substrates so as to create<br>
predefined illumination regions on one and the same<br>
surface. These regions may optionally constitute<br>
decorative patterns or constitute a display, such as a<br>
logo or a mark.<br>
For example, the continuous coatings may be in the form<br>
of an array of parallel bands, having a bandwidth of<br>
between 3 and 15 mm, and a non-conducting space between<br>
two adjacent bands, having a width greater than the<br>
width of the bands. These coatings deposited on the two<br>
substrates being offset by 180° so as to prevent two<br>
opposed conducting bands of the two substrates from<br>
facing each other. Advantageously, this makes it<br>
possible to reduce the effective capacitance of the<br>
glass substrates, favoring the supply of the lamp and<br>
its efficiency in terms of lumens/W.<br>
The electrodes may be made of any conducting material<br>
that can be made in the form of a flat element allowing<br>
light to pass through it, in particular that can be<br>
deposited as a thin layer on glass or on a plastic<br>
film, such as a PET film, as a coating that lets light<br>
through it. According to the invention, it is preferred<br>
to form a coating from a conducting metal oxide or an<br>
oxide having electron vacancies, such as fluorine-doped<br>
tin oxide or mixed indium tin oxide.<br><br>
The electrodes may instead be in the form of a metal<br>
grid incorporated into a film of plastic such as<br>
polyvinyl butyral (PVB), ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA)<br>
or other plastic, where appropriate inserted between<br>
two plastic sheets.<br>
Likewise, all or part of the internal faces of at least<br>
one of the two substrates may be coated with a phosphor<br>
material. Thus, even if continuous electrodes covering<br>
all of the surface of the glass substrates cause<br>
discharges throughout the volume of the lamp, a<br>
differentiated distribution of the phosphor in certain<br>
regions makes it possible to convert the energy of the<br>
plasma into visible radiation only in the regions in<br>
question, so as to constitute illuminating regions and<br>
juxtaposed transparent regions.<br>
The phosphor material may advantageously be selected or<br>
adapted so as to determine the color of the<br>
illumination within a broad pallet of colors.<br>
According to one embodiment, spaced between the two<br>
glass substrates are spacers made of a nonconducting<br>
material, said spacers keeping the two substrates<br>
apart. These spacers, that may be termed discrete<br>
spacers when their dimensions are considerably smaller<br>
than the dimensions of the glass substrates, may be of<br>
various shapes, for example spheres, bitruncated<br>
spheres with parallel faces or cylinders, but also<br>
parallelepipeds of polygonal cross section, especially<br>
in the form of a cross, as described in document WO<br>
99/56302.<br>
The spacing between the two substrates may be set by<br>
the spacers to a value of around 0.3 to 5 mm,<br>
especially less than or equal to about 2 mm. One<br>
technique of depositing the spacers in vacuum<br>
insulating glazing assemblies is known from<br>
FR-A-2 787 133. According to this process, spots of<br><br>
adhesive are deposited on a glass sheet, especially spots of<br>
enamel deposited by screen printing, with a diameter less than or<br>
equal to the diameter of the spacers, and the spacers are rolled<br>
over the said glass sheet, which is preferably inclined, so that<br>
a single spacer adheres to each spot of adhesive. The second<br>
glass sheet is then applied to the spacers and a peripheral seal<br>
is deposited.<br>
The spacers	are made of a non-conducting material so as not to<br>
participate	in the discharges or to cause a short circuit.<br>
Preferably,	they are made of glass, especially of the soda-lime<br>
type.<br>
To prevent loss of light by absorption in the material of the<br>
spacers, it is possible to coat the surface of the latter with a<br>
phosphor material identical to or different from that used for<br>
the glass substrate (s) .<br>
In the structure of the flat lamp according to the invention, the<br>
gas pressure in the internal space may be around 0.05 to 1 bar,<br>
advantageously around 0.05 to 0.6 bar. The gas used is an<br>
ionizable gas that can form a plasma ( a "plasma gas"),<br>
especially xenon or neon, by themselves or as a mixture.<br>
According to one embodiment, the lamp may be produced by firstly<br>
manufacturing a sealed enclosure in which the intermediate air<br>
cavity is at atmospheric pressure, and then by creating a vacuum<br>
and introducing the plasma gas at the desired pressure. According<br>
to this embodiment, one of the glass substrates includes at least<br>
one hole drilled through its thickness and obstructed by a<br>
sealing means.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for manufacturing<br>
the lamp, comprising the steps in which :<br><br>
optionally, at least one electrode is deposited<br>
on one of the glass substrates;<br>
the phosphor is screen-printed on at least one<br>
of the glass substrates, one of which is provided with<br>
a hole drilled through its thickness and on the<br>
opposite side from the electrode if the latter is<br>
deposited on the same substrate;<br>
spacers are deposited on one of the glass<br>
substrates;<br>
the glass substrates are joined together so as<br>
to be parallel;<br>
the internal space is sealed by means of a<br>
peripheral sealing material;<br>
the atmosphere contained in the internal space<br>
is replaced, via the hole, with the plasma gas; and<br>
the hole is obstructed by a sealing means;<br>
optionally, at least one first electrical<br>
insulation is joined to at least one glass substrate,<br>
the electrical insulation being intended to cover or to<br>
incorporate, internally or on the surface, the<br>
electrode with which one of the faces of said substrate<br>
has to be associated, or intended to cover the<br>
electrode that is associated with a second electrical<br>
insulation that is joined to the first electrical<br>
insulation.<br>
To replace the atmosphere with the gas, it is possible<br>
to use a method that involves pumping through a double-<br>
or multiple-glazing structure, such as the method<br>
described for example in document EP-A-645 516. The<br>
latter proposes, as sealing material, a suspension of<br>
solder glass frit. This material is placed in the form<br>
of a bead at the external end of the hole right at the<br>
start of manufacture, a vacuum is created through this<br>
component and is then softened so as to obstruct the<br>
hole.<br>
Another process is described in FR-A-2 774 373 that<br>
proposes, as sealing material, a low-melting-point<br><br>
alloy. This material may be placed in the form of a<br>
component having a shape matched to the external end of<br>
the hole right at the start of manufacture, a vacuum is<br>
created through this component and then it is melted in<br>
order to seal it to the wall of the hole so as to<br>
obstruct the latter.<br>
A preferred process according to the invention consists<br>
in obstructing the hole with a sealing pad that covers<br>
the external orifice of the hole. This pad,<br>
advantageously made of metal, may be bonded to the<br>
glass substrate by welding.<br>
The flat lamp according to the invention may be used as<br>
a luminaire for illumination and/or decoration<br>
purposes. The dimensions of the luminaire may be of the<br>
order of those current enclosures with so-called "neon"<br>
tubes, or much larger, for example at least 1 m2. Using<br>
the flat lamp offers better visual comfort than these<br>
tubes, by emitting more diffuse light, and ensures a<br>
much longer lifetime.<br>
The glass substrates may be of any shape: the outline<br>
of the substrates may be polygonal, concave or convex,<br>
especially square or rectangular, or curved, with a<br>
constant or variable radius of curvature, especially<br>
round or oval.<br>
The flat lamp according to the invention may<br>
advantageously be used as a luminaire capable of<br>
illuminating simultaneously by both its main faces.<br>
This is because its structure includes no opaque or<br>
reflecting layer capable of limiting the transmission<br>
of light on one side or the other of the lamp. However,<br>
for esthetic reasons, it is possible to prevent<br>
illumination through one face or part of one face of<br>
the lamp, for example in order to contributa to the<br>
formation of the desired pattern. Similarly, the lamp<br>
itself may be provided with such a screen, or else this<br><br>
screen may be joined to it when mounting the final<br>
luminaire.<br>
With reference to the foregoing description, the<br>
invention also relates to the application of a lamp as<br>
described to the production of architectural or<br>
decorative elements that illuminate and/or have a<br>
display function, such as flat luminaires, illuminating<br>
walls, especially suspended walls, illuminating tiles,<br>
etc.<br>
Other details and features of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description that follows,<br>
with regard to the appended drawings in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic sectional view of a<br>
flat lamp according to the invention; and<br>
figures 2, 3 and 4 show schematic sectional<br>
views of other embodiments of a flat lamp according to<br>
the invention.<br>
It should be pointed out that for the sake of clarity<br>
the various elements of the objects shown have not<br>
necessarily been drawn to scale.<br>
Figure 1 shows a flat lamp 1 consisting of two<br>
substrates made of glass sheets 2, 3 having a first<br>
face 21, 31, with which a continuous and uniform<br>
conductive coating 4, 5 constituting an electrode is<br>
associated, and a second face 23, 32 that carries a<br>
coating of a phosphor material 6, 7.<br>
The conductive coating may be joined to the substrate<br>
in various ways: it may be deposited directly on the<br>
face 21, 31 of the substrate or else deposited on an<br>
electrical insulation carrier element 14, 15, this<br>
carrier element being joined to the substrate in such a<br>
way that the coating is pressed against the face 21, 31<br>
of the substrate. The electrical insulation 14, 15 may,<br>
for example, be a plastic film of the EVA or PVB type.<br><br>
Optionally, an additional insulation 16, 17 may be<br>
added to the insulating element 14, 15 of the<br>
electrode.<br>
The sheets 2, 3 are put together with their second<br>
faces 22, 32 carrying the phosphor 6, 7 facing each<br>
other and are joined together by means of a sealing fit<br>
8, the gap between the glass sheets being set (at a<br>
value generally less than 5 mm) by glass spacers 9<br>
placed between the sheets. Here, the gap is around 0.3<br>
to 5 mm, for example 0.4 to 1 mm.<br>
The spacers 9 may have a spherical, cylindrical or<br>
cubic shape, or a shape of any other polygonal, for<br>
example cruciform, cross section. As examples, mention<br>
may be made of the TAGLIA ® cruciform spacers sold by<br>
Display Glass. The spacers may be coated, at least on<br>
their lateral surface exposed to the plasma gas<br>
atmosphere, with a phosphor identical to or different<br>
from the phosphor 6, 7 chosen from standard phosphors.<br>
In the space 10 between the glass sheets is a rare gas,<br>
such as xenon, optionally mixed with neon, at a reduced<br>
pressure, generally around one tenth of an atmosphere.<br>
The conducting layers 4, 5 based on the outside of the<br>
assembly, forming the electrodes, are connected to an<br>
appropriate power supply (not shown) via flexible leads<br>
11.<br>
A glass sheet 2 has, near the periphery, a hole 12<br>
drilled through its thickness, the external orifice of<br>
which is obstructed by a sealing pad 13, especially<br>
made of copper bonded to the external face of the sheet<br>
bearing the electrode 4.<br>
The lamp is manufactured in the following manner: the<br>
substrates, cut and made to the desired shape, are<br><br>
produced from a glass sheet, for example about 3 mm in<br>
thickness, coated with a thxn layer of fluorine-doped<br>
Sn02. A through-hole 12 a few millimeters in diameter<br>
is made near the edge of the substrate 2.<br>
The functional phosphor layers 6, 7, and possibly other<br>
functional, for example power supply, elements, are<br>
deposited, especially by screen printing.<br>
The spacers 9 are deposited on the layer 7 of the<br>
substrate 3 at predefined positions, for example by<br>
means of an automaton, and the substrate 2 is applied<br>
with its internal face 22 facing the internal face 32<br>
of the substrate 3. A sealing fritt is deposited around<br>
the internal peripheral band of the two substrates and<br>
a high-temperature sealing operation carried out.<br>
Next, by means of a pump, the atmosphere contained in<br>
the sealed enclosure is removed through the hole 12 and<br>
is replaced with the xenon/neon mixture. When the<br>
desired gas pressure is reached, the sealing pad 13 is<br>
placed over the opening of the hole 12, around which a<br>
bead of welding alloy has been deposited. A heat source<br>
is activated near the weld so as to cause the latter to<br>
soften, and the pad 13 is pressed by gravity against<br>
the orifice of the hole and thus welded to the<br>
substrate 2, forming a hermetic plug.<br>
This structure makes it possible to manufacture a lamp<br>
with standard glass products, glass coated with<br>
fluorine-doped Sn02 (electrodes) being widely used in<br>
glazing assemblies. Then, the addition of the<br>
electrical insulation 14, 15 being carried out in a<br>
known manner depending on the type of material, by<br>
casting a cold resin or by hot bonding of a<br>
thermoplastic sheet.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 2, the structure of<br>
the lamp basically repeats the structure of figure 1,<br><br>
apart from the arrangement of a conductive coating or<br>
electrode 4, 5.<br>
The conductive coating 4, 5 is sandwiched between a<br>
first electrical insulation 14, 15 and a second<br>
electrical insulation, or additional insulation, 16,<br>
17, the combination being joined to the glass sheet 2,<br>
3.<br>
These electrical insulations 14, 15, 16, 17 may be<br>
formed as various combinations that combine, for<br>
example, a glass sheet and/or plastic films, of the PVB<br>
or PET type, or other resins capable of being<br>
adhesively joined to glass products.<br>
Thus, the glass sheet 2, 3 may support, as combination,<br>
a PBV sheet 14, 15 bonded to the glass sheet as first<br>
electrical insulation and, as second electrical<br>
insulation 16, 17, a glass or a plastic film joined to<br>
the PVB sheet, the electrode being placed between the<br>
two electrical insulations.<br>
Another combination of electrical insulations (not<br>
illustrated) is as follows: a PVB sheet is taken as<br>
first electrical insulation, that will serve to bond<br>
the second electrical insulation and carrier of the<br>
electrode, such as a PVB sheet, the electrode being<br>
between the PVB sheet and the PET sheet, and a third<br>
electrical insulation, such as a PVB sheet, that will<br>
cover the PET sheet in order to protect it from being<br>
scratched.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 3 repeats that of figure<br>
2, except that the electrode is not incorporated at a<br>
face of an electrical insulation but is incorporated<br>
into the thickness of the first electrical insulation<br>
14, 15.<br><br>
The manufacture of the lamp according to figures 2 and<br>
3 takes place as explained above, without the step of<br>
depositing the conductive coatings. A step of<br>
laminating the electrical insulations provided with<br>
conductive coatings, on the external faces 21, 31 of<br>
the lamp, is carried out after the step of obstructing<br>
the hole in the structure.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 4, the structure of<br>
the lamp also basically repeats the structure of figure<br>
1, except for the arrangement of the conductive coating<br>
or electrode 4, 5.<br>
Here, the conductive coating 4, 5 is incorporated into<br>
the glass sheet 2, 3 that constitutes the electrical<br>
insulation as such.<br>
Additional electrical insulations, not shown here, may<br>
be laminated with at least one glass sheet.<br>
The manufacture of the lamp takes place as explained in<br>
the case of figure 1 without the step of depositing the<br>
conductive coatings, since they have already been<br>
incorporated into the glass sheets.<br>
The examples that have just been described in no way<br>
limit the invention.<br>
In particular, in the embodiments that have just been<br>
described the electrodes were formed from coatings<br>
covering the entire surface of the glass sheets, but it<br>
is understood that at least one of the glass sheets may<br>
have a group of electrodes formed from several regions,<br>
each having a surface of greater or lesser area each<br>
covered with a continuous coating.<br>
Moreover, in the embodiments described above, the<br>
alternative ways of assembling the conductive elements<br>
may be applied differently to each of the glass sheets<br><br>
2, 3 of the structure, it being possible for one glass<br>
sheet to present one form of assembly while the other<br>
glass sheet presents another form of assembly.<br><br>
