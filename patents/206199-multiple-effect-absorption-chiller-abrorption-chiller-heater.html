Referring now to the drawings, some of the preferred embodiments of the invention are described in detail below.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a double-effect absorption chiller having a safety device in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.  As shown in Fig. 1, the double-effect absorption chiller comprises an evaporator 10, absorber 12, condenser 14, low temperature regenerator 16, high temperature<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
regenerator 18 having a combustion device 17 to heat and concentrate an absorption solution by directly burning the fuel such as gas or oil, low temperature heat exchanger 20, high temperature heat exchanger 22, solution circulating pump, and solution piping and refrigerant piping for the connection of these devices.<br>
Pressure rise preventing means 26 such as a safety valve, rapture disk and breakable plate (as an example, a safety valve is shown in Fig. 1; hereinafter, it is shown as safety valve 2 6 as needed) is connected to the refrigerant piping 24 from high temperature regenerator 18, and discharge opening 28 of the safety valve 26 is connected to a low temperature regenerator 16 through pressure relief piping 30.<br>
In a double-effect absorption chiller having a construction as described, the absorption solution (rare solution, e.g. lithium bromide solution) in the absorber 12 is delivered by a solution pump (low temperature pump) 32 to the high temperature regenerator 18 through the low temperature heat exchanger 20 and high temperature heat exchanger 22, then the fuel is burnt at the combustion device 17 and the absorption solution is heated by the generated combustion gas and concentrated. Incidentally/ as the heating source for high temperature regenerator 18, it is possible to use steam or exhaust gas from heat engines such as a gas engine, gas turbine, etc. instead of installing a combustion device to utilize the fuel combustion heat.<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
The absorption solution from high temperature regenerator 18 is sent to the low temperature regenerator 16 via high temperature heat exchanger 22, where the solution is heated and concentrated by the refrigerant vapor (e.g. water vapor) from the high temperature regenerator 18. Subsequently, the absorption solution from the low temperature regenerator 16 is fed to the low temperature heat exchanger 20. After that, the solution is introduced into the absorber 12 and is indirectly cooled by cooling water and also mixed with refrigerant solution (e.g. water) from the evaporator 10 to become a rare solution.<br>
On the other hand, the refrigerant vapor from the high temperature regenerator 18 enters the low temperature regenerator 16 where the vapor heats the absorption solution to become condensed and liquefied and then enters the condenser 14. The refrigerant vapor generated as a result of concentration of the absorption solution in the low temperature regenerator 16 enters the condenser 14 and is indirectly cooled by the cooling water to become condensed. After that, the refrigerant solution (liquid) (e.g. water) enters the evaporator 10, then the condensed refrigerant solution is sprinkled by refrigerant pump 34 to the heat transfer pipe (with water circulated) of evaporator 10, thereby obtaining chilled water.<br>
Even when the pressure in the high temperature regenerator 18 increases during operation, causing the safety valve 26 to<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
operate, the refrigerant vapor and absorption solution from the high temperature regenerator 18 will be discharged to the low temperature regenerator 16 designed to generally maintain a vacuum therein during operation. Therefore, it is possible to assure safety, preventing open-to-atmosphere trouble, and to quickly and readily perform the restoration after safety assurance.<br>
The low pressure units such as the low temperature regenerator 16 are designed to maintain a great amount of vacuum at all times by means of a vacuum pump or automatic bleeder in order to maintain the performance during the cooling operation. Also, during suspension of the operation, heating is not performed at the high temperature regenerator 18, then the low temperature and high temperature sides are at the same pressure level and generally maintained under a vacuum so that the safety valve 26 will never be activated.<br>
In the present embodiment, the safety device comprises safety valve 26 and pressure relief piping 30 which connects discharge opening 28 of the safety valve to the low pressure units such as low temperature regenerator 16.<br>
The above description of the embodiment refers to a series flow type double-effect absorption chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution, pumped up from the absorber 12 to the high temperature regenerator 18, flows to the low temperature regenerator 16, but the embodiment<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
described is also applicable to a reverse flow type double-effect absorption chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution is pumped up from the absorber to the low temperature regenerator and further up to the high temperature regenerator, and also applicable to a parallel flow type double-effect absorption chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution is pumped up from the absorber simultaneously to the high temperature regenerator and the low temperature regenerator.<br>
Also, it will be appreciated that the embodiment is naturally applicable to an absorption chiller-heater instead of an absorption chiller. In this case, there is provided a chiller/heater changeover valve (not shown) between the refrigerant piping of the low temperature regenerator and the evaporator, and the changeover valve is closed during chiller operation, while the valve is opened during heater operation, thereby discontinuing the cooling water supply to the absorber and condenser. Incidentally, it is also possible to use a once-through boiler in place of the high temperature regenerator.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a double-effect absorption chiller having a safety device in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment has a construction such that there is provided a pressure rise preventing means for the high pressure side, for example, a temperature measuring device<br>

(e.g. a temperature sensor) or a pressure measuring device (e.g. a pressure sensor) in pressure relief piping 30 that connects discharge opening 28 of safety valve 26 to low pressure units, and the temperature or pressure sensor 36 is electrically connected to a safety control monitor unit 38 of the exterior<br>
(outside the system), whereby the temperature change or pressure change is detected, as the safety valve 26 of the high pressure side is activated in case of refrigerant vapor and absorption solution outflow, then the detected signal is transmitted through an electrically built-in safety circuit to stop the combustion at the high temperature regenerator 18 or to stop the heating source supply to discontinue the operation, and at the same time to inform the abnormality to the outside. In this embodiment, when the pressure in the high temperature regenerator 18 increases causing the safety valve 26 to be activated, since the discharge opening 28 is connected to the low pressure side via the pressure relief piping 30, it is possible to discharge the pressure, assuring safety and also preventing open-to-atmosphere trouble, and to quickly and readily perform the restoration after safety assurance, and also to stop the operation and to inform the abnormality to the outside.<br>
In this embodiment, the safety device comprises safety valve 26, pressure relief piping 30 that connects discharge opening 28 of the safety valve to the low pressure units such<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
as low temperature regenerator 16, temperature sensor or pressure sensor 36, and a safety control or monitor unit 38 connected to the temperature sensor or pressure sensor 36. The other construction and operation are the same as in the first embodiment.<br>
fig. 3 shows a multiple-effect absorption chiller in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 3 is a triple-effect absorption chiller as an example.

Pressure rise preventing means 26 such as a safety valve, rapture disk and breakable plate (as an example, a safety valve is shown in Fig. 3; hereinafter, it is shown as safety valve 26 as needed) is connected to the refrigerant vapor piping 24 from high temperature regenerator 18, and discharge opening 28 of the safety valve 26 is connected to medium temperature regenerator 40 through pressure relief piping 30.<br>

16	through pressure relief: piping 50.<br>
In a triple-effect absorption chiller having a construction as described, the absorption solution (rare solution, e.g. lithium bromide solution) in the absorber 12 is delivered by solution pump (low temperature pump) 32 to the high temperature regenerator 18 through the low temperature heat exchanger 20, medium temperature heat exchanger 42 and high temperature heat exchanger 22, then the fuel is burnt at the combustion device<br>
17	and the absorption solution is heated by the generated<br>
combustion gas and concentrated. Incidentally, as the heating<br>
source for high temperature regenerator 18, it is possible to<br>
use steam or exhaust gas from heat engines such as a gas engine,<br>
gas turbine, etc. instead of installing a combustion device to<br>
utilize the fuel combustion heat.<br>
The absorption solution from the high temperature regenerator 18 is sent to the medium temperature regenerator 40 via high temperature heat exchanger 22, where the solution is heated and concentrated by the refrigerant vapor (e.g. water vapor) f rom high temperature regenerator 18 . Subsequently, the absorption solution from medium temperature regenerator 40 is<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
fed to the medium temperature heat exchanger 42. After that, the solution is introduced into the low temperature regenerator 16 where it is heated and concentrated by the refrigerant vapor from the medium regenerator 40. The absorption solution from low temperature regenerator 16 is fed to the low temperature heat exchanger 20. After that, the solution is introduced into the absorber 12 and is indirectly cooled by cooling water and also mixed with refrigerant solution (e.g. water) from the evaporator 10 to become a rare solution.<br>
On the other hand, the refrigerant vapor from the high temperature regenerator 18 enters the medium temperature regenerator 40 where the refrigerant vapor heats the absorption solution to become partially condensed and liquefied and then enters the low temperature regenerator 16. The refrigerant vapor generated as a result of concentration of the absorption solution in the medium temperature regenerator 40 is introduced into low temperature regenerator 16 through refrigerant vapor piping 44.<br>
The refrigerant vapor generated as a result of concentration of the absorption solution in the low temperature regenerator 16 enters the condenser 14 and is indirectly cooled by the cooling water to become condensed. After that, the refrigerant solution (e.g. water) enters the evaporator 10, then the condensed refrigerant solution is sprinkled by refrigerant pump 34 to the heat transfer pipe (with water<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
circulated) of evaporator 10, thereby obtaining chilled water.<br>
Even when the pressure in the high temperature regenerator 18 increases during operation, causing the safety valve 2 6 to operate, the refrigerant vapor and absorption solution from the high temperature regenerator 18 will be discharged to the medium temperature regenerator 40 designed so as to generally maintain a vacuum therein during operation. Thus, it will be appreciated that it is possible to assure safety, preventing open-to-atmosphere trouble, and to quickly and readily perform the restoration after safety assurance.<br>
Also, when the pressure in medium temperature regenerator 40 increases during operation causing the rapture disk 4 6 to operate, the refrigerant vapor and absorption solution from medium regenerator 40 will be discharged to low temperature regenerator 16 designed so as to generally maintain a vacuum therein during operation. Thus, it will be appreciated that it is possible to assure safety, preventing open-to-atmosphere trouble, and to quickly and readily perform the restoration after safety assurance.<br>
In this way, it is possible to use the interior volume of the shell for pressure reduction purpose by connecting the discharge opening of safety valve 26 or rapture disk 4 6 to the low pressure units in sequence via the pressure relief piping. Also, it is desirable to make the proper use of the pressure rise preventing means, for example, a safety valve for the high<br>
- 27 -<br><br>
pressure side and rapture disk for the low pressure side, making the most of their features in accordance with each pressure level.<br>
The low pressure units such as low temperature regenerator 16 are designed to maintain a great amount of vacuum at all times by means of a vacuum pump or automatic bleeder in order to maintain the performance during the cooling operation. Also, during suspension of the operation, heating is not performed at the high temperature regenerator 18, then the low temperature and high temperature sides are at the same pressure level and generally maintained under a vacuum so that the safety valve 26 will never be activated.<br>
In the present embodiment, the safety device comprises safety valve 2 6, and pressure relief piping 30 which connects discharge opening 28 of the safety-valve to medium temperature regenerator 40, rapture disk 46, and pressure relief piping 50 which connects discharge opening 48 of the rapture disk to low pressure units such as low temperature regenerator 16.<br>
The above description of the embodiment refers to a series flow type triple-effect absorption chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution pumped up from the absorber 12 to the high temperature regenerator 18 flows to the low temperature regenerator 16 through the medium temperature regenerator 40, but the embodiment described is also applicable to a reverse flow type triple-effect absorption<br>

chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution is pumped up from the absorber to the low temperature regenerator and further up to the high temperature regenerator through the medium temperature regenerator, and also to a parallel flow type triple-effect absorption chiller connected and disposed in a manner such that the absorption solution is pumped up from the absorber simultaneously to the high temperature regenerator, medium temperature regenerator and low temperature regenerator. Also, the embodiment is applicable to a quadruple-effect or other multiple-effect absorption chiller.<br>
Also, it will be appreciated that the embodiment is naturally applicable to an absorption chiller-heater instead of an absorption chiller. In this case, there is provided a chiller/heater changeover valve (not shown) between the refrigerant piping of the low temperature regenerator and/or medium temperature regenerator and the evaporator, and the changeover valve is closed during chiller operation, while the valve is opened during heater operation, thereby discontinuing the cooling water supply to the absorber and condenser. Incidentally, it is also possible to use a once-through boiler in place of the high temperature regenerator.<br>

By virtue of this construction, even when the pressure in the high temperature regenerator increases during operation causing the safety valve, rapture disk or the like to operate, it is possible to maintain the pressure reduction, assuring safety and avoiding the bad influence of corrosion due to open-to-atmosphere trouble, and also to quickly and readily perform the restoration.</td>
