				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to reactors for gasification / low temperature conversion (LTC) of organic material for producing solid and gaseous fuel there from and, in particular, to a dual use continuous reactor for carrying out gasification as well as low temperature conversion to generate solid and gaseous fuel from organic material. The reactor can thus be selectively and advantageously used for generating producer gas for ready utilization as a process heat or for the power generation or alternatively the reactor can be used for internally heating organic material for gasification and convert the residue to coal, gas and oil in absence of air (anaerobically) at low temperature to achieve the desired low temperature conversion (LTC). The dual use reactor is cost effective to obtain and maintain and on the other hand is very simple and user friendly to carry out the desired gasification or the low temperature conversion.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that handling of organic matter is difficult and accumulation of waste by- product in refining or processing of organic matter is a problem. The cost of disposing such biomass is, therefore, high and is also suspect to the environmentally hazards. The art of land filling or open incinerator burning of organic waste is found harmful for environmental reasons and offends the present day laws and regulation directed to protecting the environment.<br>
The above has lead to the development of systems, procedures and equipments whereby it would be possible to clean bum organic waste material to convert organic waste material into gas as an alternative energy source. US 5,666,890 discloses such a system directed to clean bum organic waste material.<br>
Many known gasification systems involve the requirement of drying the biomass in order to reduce water content whereby it is possible to process waste even with high range of moisture content. Alternatively, it is also proposed to initially convert the biomass into pellets and chips before subjecting the same to combustion. Other system such as US 5,666,890 suggest basic pre- processing<br>
1<br><br>
of the biomass through particle size reduction to facilitate the conversion process.<br>
While the above systems and processes do appear to address the issue of effective processing of waste controlling environmental hazards, such process and devices are found to be expensive complex and sometime impracticable for the desired efficient disposal of waste.<br>
Various other gasification systems have been also developed over the years to meet requirements such as for individual mills or plantation operation. Some of the system are also directed to efficient discharge of the gasses involving fan or blower. Likewise systems directed to efficient utilization of producer gas such as for use in diesel and petrol engines are also disclosed and made available to the art.<br>
US Patent Application 20020046686 Al discloses a method and portable apparatus for the conversion of cellulose and other biomass waste materials through a pyrolysis and partial combustion sequence in a downdraft gasifler to produce a gas which can be immediately utilized to fuel an internal combustion engine in generator set (genset). More specifically, the heat from the combustion of part of the cellulose or other waste input is used to pyrolyze the remainder of the input to produce a mixture of permanent fuel gases.<br>
US 6,790,383 teaches a method of gasifying organic materials (carbonaceous compounds) such as coal, shredded waste tire or waste oil into gaseous fuel, carbon monoxide and hydrogen and an apparatus therefore are provided. The method comprises the steps of supplying the organic materials into the reactor and reacting them with the water and carbon dioxide to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas, discharging the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the reactor, recycling a part of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas discharged from the reactor into the reactor, and reacting the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas supplied into the reactor with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. The method states of facilitating the control of temperature in the gasification reactor as well as producing fuel gas of high quality by increasing the concentration of hydrogen.<br>
2<br><br>
US Patent Application 20040206280A1 discusses yet another method of treatment of domestic waste. A reaction space is provided, into which the waste to be treated is fed at a controlled rate. The waste is concurrently compacted to form a stopper preventing leakage of gases from the reaction space. An oxygen-containing gas is fed to the reaction space, in order to affect the combustion of the waste and produce gases and solid material. The gas is filtered through the solid material, causing the gases to react with the solid material, whereby to produce fuel gases and ash.<br>
Also in our co pending Indian application no. 230/KOL/2004A there is disclosed a system for continuous conversion of organic starting materials to generate solid, liquid and gaseous fuels involving a lower reactor unit and an upper reactor unit operatively connected and adapted such that the organic material fed from the top is first pre- heated in the upper reactor unit by hot gases of the burnt fuel used in heating the lower reactor unit and finally converted into selective solid, liquid or gaseous fuel by further heating in the lower reactor unit; the inlets means being adapted to prevent entry of outside air into the reactor units and favour gravity feed for said conversion treatment with the outlet means for solid fuel generated at the bottom of said lower reactor unit comprising a converging shaped outlet . The system is directed to be energy efficient apart from being compact, easily portable and assembled at site and thus user friendly.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that while several varieties of gasification and low temperature conversion systems producing gaseous fuel are made available to the art usually such system are either limited for use as a gasifier or the same is developed specifically for low temperature conversion of organic waste. Moreover, it is found that such devices are also sometimes either too complex and cost extensive to procure or suffer from lack of safety considerations. In some such known gasification equipments the partial pyrolysis of cellulose or other hydrocarbon material results in the formation of breakdown product which are gaseous at the elevated temperature in or near the gasification zone but which condense in pipes, valves and chambers at lower temperatures. Such complexities are very common for gasification equipment, which operated, in an up draft mode that is where the product gasses are removed from top of the vessel.<br>
3<br><br>
Importantly, due to such known limitations of conventional gasifiers and low temperature conversion units there has been a continues need in the art to develop new and user friendly varieties of such gasifiers which could serve wide variety of conversions for ready application and use. However, the process of treatment of waste for gasification and for the solid fuel generation involving low temperature conversion being based on different approach for waste conversion, it has been difficult to provide for a device which could be effectively used for gasification as well as low temperature conversion for generation of solid and gaseous fuel.<br>

Figure 6A &amp; 6B illustrate variant of the lower grate suitable of use in the reactor system of the invention involving a fixed lower part (Figure 6A) and moveable upper part (Figure 6B).<br>
Reference is first invited to Figure 1A which illustrate by way of a front sectional view the reactor system in accordance in the invention. As shown is said Figure 1A, the reactor is comprised of an upper chamber (1) and lower chamber (2) separated by means of rod like agitator means (3). According to this embodiment, the reactor system is adapted for gasification or LTC of the organic material. For the purpose the upper chamber (1) is shown to be fed with organic material (4) through and inlet (5) and by means of a hopper. The gaseous outlet (6) is shown provided in top for egress of the producer gas generated. The organic material (4) is shown blocking gases from flowing in and out of the reactor by forming a plug in the converging hopper (8).<br>

The feed material thus introduced rest on rod like agitator means (3) which are disposed substantially horizontally to separate the upper (1) and the lower chamber (2). The distance of the rods constituting the agitator means (3) is dependent on the material fed. For municipal solid waste; agro waste and biomass from forest and other type of organic material usually distant about 250 mm is preferred. In accordance with an aspect of invention the said rod like agitator means are adapted to rattle to agitate the material. The partly decomposed material thus fall in to the lower chamber.<br>
As further illustrated in said figure in case of gasification the air is allowed to pass into the lower chamber (2) from the openings (7) at the bottom of the lower chamber (2). The ash resulting from combustion can also be removed from the reactor also through such openings (7).<br>
The producer gas, which is emanating at the top of the upper chamber (1) can be burnt directly for process heat. In the alternative, the gas can also be cooled, purified and used for power generation in an internal combustion engine or gas turbine.<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 1B which illustrate in side sectional view the reactor system of Figure 1A. In this view the plurality of rods (3) separating the upper chamber (1) and the lower chamber (2) are further shown.

Figure 2B illustrates the position of the rod (3) and air inlet openings (7) in the lower chamber (2) and the feed inlet (5) hi the upper chamber (1) in the side view.<br>
Reference in now invited to. accompanying Figures 3A to. 3C which illustrate the reactor system of the invention adapted for low temperature conversion and generation of solid and gaseous fuel.<br>
As illustrated in the Figure 3A, in this embodiment also the reactor is divided into upper chamber (1) and a lower chamber (2) by the substantially horizontally placed agitator means which are rod like tubular members (3). As distinct from the embodiment of Figure 1A for gasification, in this embodiment, for low temperature conversion, the agitator means / pipes (3) used for separating the upper and lower chamber are provided with holes/slits so that air can be supplied there through from outside into the middle of the bottom of the upper reaction chamber. Besides the slits in the rods or pipes (agitator means) the system can additionally incorporate Openings for air entry at the bottom of the lower chamber (2).<br>
In this embodiment the doors (7) of the outlets at the bottom are usually kept close. The generated coal gather at the bottom of the lower chamber (2) and can be discharged from the outlet (7) from time to time by opening the doors. Water may be used to cool the removed fine hot coal. The coal bed in the lower chamber is further adapted to prevent air entering into the reactor from below during discharging. Provisions are provided for holding and rattling the rods from outside.<br>
In case of low temperature conversion air is allowed to pass into the bottom of the upper chamber (1) for partly burning the gas and oil produced by the LTC in the lower chamber. In case of gasification such air passage that is the air flow in to the reactor is prevented by insulation with mineral wool and glass wool and any other material which is suitable.<br>
15<br><br>
In case of the use of the reactor system for gasification and low temperature conversion, the hot gasses produced in the lower chamber and at the lower end of the upper chamber are used for drying, preheating and partly decomposing the material in the upper chamber. Therefore, in the reactor system of the invention no outside heating or fuel is required. Air can enter through natural thermal flow, no pressure or pre heating of the air is required. The producer gas which is emanating at the top of the upper chamber can be burnt directly for process. The gas can also be cooled, purified and used for power generation in an internal combustion engine or a gas turbine.<br>
The reactor of the invention which include simple and cost effective means can be constructed of any suitable material such as steel, bricks, stones etc. or combination thereof. Preferably the reactor can be insulated by mineral wool, glass wool and any other suitable material. The shape of the reactor can be selectively provided in the form of rectangular cylindrical, conical, polygonal or a combination thereof.<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 4A to 4C which illustrate yet another embodiment of the reactor of the invention involving grate means as the separator between the upper and lower chamber and also as the agitator for effective processing of the organic material.<br>
As shown in said Figure 4A while the basic constructional features of the reactor<br>
remain the same as that the discussed in relation to earlier embodiment,<br>
according to this embodiment, the agitator means is shown provided comprising<br>
of rods and pipes obtaining of the form of grate (3). The grate may be fixed on a<br>
vertical axis (3V) while the outer ends of the grate may be adapted to rest on a<br>
support. The axis is fixed by rods to the walls of the reactor and / or the legs the<br>
bottom of the reactor. Preferably, the vertical axis (3V) is connected to a lever<br>
or a chain or any other drive for moving the axis back and forth or even rotating<br>
the axis, rattling is however, preferred.<br>
Figure 4B illustrate in side sectional view the reactor system of Figure 4A involving a grate type agitator means while Figure 4C is a top view of the whole grate type agitator incorporating reactor of Figure 4A.<br>
16<br><br>
Reference is now invited to Figures 5A to 5C which illustrate in top view the configuration of the upper, middle and lower grate respectively in the grate type agitator used in the reactor of the Figure 4A. As would be evident from the illustration of the upper, middle and lower grates it is clear that the upper grate has the maximum opening in terms of flow path than the opening in the middle and the lower grates i.e. the flow paths available thorough the grates decrease from the upper to the lower grate.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying Figures 6A and 6B which show a variant especially for gasification, of the grate at the bottom of the tower chamber comprise of a fixed grate with small distance rods which is intersected by more wide sectors. Above the fixed grate there is provided a wide grate which is moveable. This intersection of the lower grate is superceded by rods of the upper grate. So large pieces of ash or inorganic material are provided to pass through the grate on rattling or rotating the tipper grate. In this way the content of the organic material supported by the agitator / rod / grate means can be controlled along with the flow of gas and the reaction process by the reactor of the present invention.<br>
In the above disclosed dual use reactor system of the invention, the feeding can be done manually or by mechanical devices like screw conveyers, piston pushing the material or by any other like suitable device. The agitating of the material and its processing can be control manually or by mechanical devices like pistons, chain wheel attachment to an axis with grate / rods / pipes or any other suitable agitator means. Likewise, the removal of ash on gasification or coal on low temperature conversion can be removed manually or mechanically by screw conveyors, belt conveyors and any other suitable device.<br>
The above, therefore, clearly and sufficiently reveal the utilities and advantages of the dual purpose reactor system for gasification and low temperature conversion of organic base which is not only efficient in both the above varieties of conversion of biomass to valuable gas / solid fuel but also importantly avoid the need for any pre-drying (which is required only if the moisture content is above 35 % ) on the organic material before the conversion thereby making the processes simple and user-friendly. The system is also adapted such as to avoid complexities of mechanical moving parts and yet achieve fast and efficient<br>
17<br><br>
partial combustion/gasification of the organic material. The system and in particular the selective and advantageous provision of simple agitator means adapted to separate the upper and lower chamber, support and control the organic material content and flow of gasses and the simple and user friendly manner of discharge of ash and solid fuel from the lower chamber outlet as and when applicable make it convenient to operate and use. The dual purpose reactor therefore would enable simple and easy conversion of variety of organic material into valuable fuel and can be widely used and applied for such purposes.<br>
