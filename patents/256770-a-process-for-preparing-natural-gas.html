				<td>FIELD OF THE INEVNTION<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of natural gas. More particularly, the present invention relates to the preparation of methane enriched natural gas from detergent powder.<br>
BACKGROUND AND THE PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural gas, in itself, is colorless, shapeless, and odorless in its pure form. However, natural gas is combustible, and when burned it gives off a great deal of energy. Unlike other fossil fuels, however, natural gas is clean burning and emits lower levels of potentially harmful byproducts into the air. We require energy constantly, to heat our homes, cook our food, and generate our electricity. It is this need for energy that has elevated natural gas to such a level of importance in our society, and in our lives.<br>
Natural gas is a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases. While natural gas is formed primarily of methane, it can also include ethane, propane, butane and pentane. The composition of natural gas can vary widely, but below is a chart outlining the typical makeup of natural gas before it is refined. It is used in the form of a fuel, lamp black, hydrogen, and gasoline and in the formation of other organic substances.(Figure Removed) <br>
Natural gas is a fossil fuel. Like oil and coal, this means that it is, essentially, the remains of plants and animals and microorganisms that lived millions and millions of years ago. There are many different theories as to the origins of fossil fuels. The most widely accepted theory says that fossil fuels are formed when organic matter (such as the remains of a plant or animal) is compressed under the earth, at very high pressure for a very long time. This is referred to as thermogenic methane.<br>
Similar to the formation of oil, thermogenic methane is <br>
formed from organic particles that are covered in mud and other sediment. Over time, more and more sediment and mud and other debris are piled on top of the organic matter. This sediment and debris puts a great deal of pressure on the organic matter, which compresses it. This compression, combined with high temperatures found deep underneath the earth, break down the carbon bonds in the organic matter. As one gets deeper and deeper under the earths crust, the temperature gets higher and higher.<br>
At low temperatures (shallower deposits), more oil is produced relative to natural gas. At higher temperatures, however, more natural gas is created, as opposed to oil. That is why natural gas is usually associated with oil in deposits that are 1 to 2 miles below the earth's crust. Deeper deposits, very far underground, usually contain primarily natural gas, and in many cases, pure methane.<br>
Natural gas can also be formed through the transformation of organic matter by tiny microorganisms. This type of methane is referred to as biogenic methane. Methanogens, tiny methane producing microorganisms, chemically break down organic matter to produce methane. These microorganisms are commonly found in areas near the surface of the earth that are void of oxygen. These microorganisms also live in the intestines of most animals, including humans. Formation of methane in this manner usually takes place close to the surface of the earth, and the methane produced is usually lost into the atmosphere. In certain circumstances, however, this methane can be trapped underground, recoverable as natural gas. An example of biogenic methane is landfill gas. Waste-containing landfills produce a relatively large amount of natural gas, from the decomposition of the waste materials that they contain. New technologies are allowing this gas to be harvested and used to add to the supply of natural gas.<br>
A third way in which methane (and natural gas) may be formed is through a biogenic process. Extremely deep under the earth's crust, there exist hydrogen-rich gases and carbon molecules. As these gases gradually rise towards the surface of the earth, they may interact with minerals that also exist underground, in the absence of oxygen.<br>
This interaction may result in a reaction, forming elements and compounds that are found in the atmosphere (including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and water). If these gases are under very high pressure as they move towards the surface of the earth, they are likely to form methane deposits, similar to thermogenic methane.<br>
Cooling natural gas to about -260°F at normal pressure results in the condensation of the gas into liquid form, known as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). LNG can be very useful, particularly for the 'transportation of natural gas, since LNG takes up about one six hundredth the volume of gaseous natural gas. Because it is easy to transport, LNG can serve to make economical those stranded natural gas deposits for which the construction of pipelines is uneconomical. LNG, when vaporized to gaseous form, will only burn in concentrations of between 5 and 15 percent mixed with air. In addition, LNG, or any vapor associated with LNG, will not explode in an unconfined environment. Thus, in the unlikely event of an LNG spill, the natural gas has little chance of igniting an explosion. Liquefaction also has the advantage of removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfur, and water from the natural gas, resulting in LNG that is almost pure methane.<br>
The increased use of LNG is allowing for the production and marketing of natural gas deposits that were previously economically unrecoverable, it is expected that LNG imports will provide a steady, dependable source of natural gas for consumption.<br>
As it is known that while natural gas is produced with the mineral oils, the cost of production of natural gas is very high in international market.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The primary objective of the present invention in to produce natural gas contains<br>
more amount of methane than the natural gas obtained from the oil.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to produce liquefied fuel gas<br>
which is more cost-efficient than the natural gas obtained from oil.<br>
The another objective of the present invention is to produce the natural gas<br>
without the use of mineral oil, so that the production cost gas of get lower.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process lor preparing of natural gas which enriched in methane. The present process uses detergent as source of sodium lauryl sulfate, which is normally available in the market at very low cost The process comprissing the step of miring sodium lauryl sulfate with dilute hydro-choric acid, in the presence of alunium and copper ions, in order to obtain mixture of methane, ethane, propane and butane. The produced gas is enriched with methane and is colorless and odnrless. The whole processes no dot produce my waste material, toys it is a eco friendly. Thus produced gas can be liquefied by conventionally known method<br>
