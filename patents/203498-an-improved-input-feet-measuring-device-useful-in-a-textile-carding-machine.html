				<td>Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to an input measuring device for a textile carding machine . The device of the present invention is useful for sensing and controlling the variation in feed material delivered to the feed rollers of a carding machine in order to effect control over the feed material to achieve reduction in coefficient of variation in the sliver delivered by the carding machine. This invention also relates to an improved sensing plate assembly useful for the incorporation into the input feed device of the present invention<br>
Background Art<br>
In a carding machine the out put sliver quality depends on the uniformity in weight per unit length of the feed material either in the form of lap or flock. The material is bound to have variation in weight per unit length both in length wise and width wise in the lap or the flock fed. Since the carding machine adopts higher drafts between the feed rollers and delivery rollers, the variation in the feed material, though very small, is magnified in the resultant out put sliver quality. Width wise variation is likely to occur in the chute due to the reason that the filling of the chute is not uniform<br>
The method of controlling the feed roller speed to have control over the feed material using the sensors fitted to both ends of the feed rollers is known. In the known method the feed roller move up and down due to the variation in the weight per unit length of the feed material presented between the feed roller and feed plate against the pre determined applied spring load at both the ends of the feed roller. The movement of the feed roller obtained depends on the variation in the feed material in the length wise direction only and is the cumulative effect on the width. Individual variation on the desired sections cannot be measured.<br>
The method of sensing the variation in the mass of feed material along the width of feed roller comprising a sensing roller located prior to the feed roller and driven in synchronization with the feed roller with plurality of sensing plates with plurality of<br><br>
sensing arrangement attached to it for the passage of feed material to the feed roller to sense the variation in feed material in width wise direction is known.<br>
Our CO pending patent applications 1031 /MAS/2000, 1032/MAS/2000 and 1033/MAS/2000 describe three distinct apparatus for sensing thickness variation of feed material in a carding machine having distinct features.<br>
1031/MAS/2000 discloses an apparatus for sensing thickness variation of feed in a carding machine comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets and rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller , plurality of spring loaded sensing plate arranged across the entire width of said sensing roller and located under said sensing roller , the movement of sensing plates are sensed by sensing means located coaxially beneath said bottom stud and fed to a micro processor which averages the values and modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed. This arrangement is shown in figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification .<br>
1032/MAS/2000 discloses a carding machine comprises feed plate and feed roller for feeding the fibre batt to the licker in zone of the carding comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller , plurality of spring loaded sensing plates arranged across the entire width of said sensing roller and located under said sensing roller , said sensing plates attached to plurality of input sensing pistons provided in a fluid cylinder , the combined pressure generated by said plurality of sensing pistons provide movement to an out put piston provided on said fluid cylinder , the movement of the out put piston is sensed by a sensing means and fed to a micro processor which modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed. This arrangement is shown in figure 2<br><br>
1033/MAS/2000 discloses an apparatus for sensing the thickness variation in the feed material in a carding machine comprises a sensing roller supported on two end brackets and rigidly fixed to a support frame and located along the width of the carding machine, said sensing roller located parallel and close to feed roller of the carding machine and driven at the same speed as that of said feed roller , plurality spring loaded sensing plates provided with sensing stud with spring loading means ,the sensing plates are hinged at one end on a hinge bracket, the movement of the sensing stud is magnified by virtue of the hinge bracket arrangement, the movement of sensing plates are sensed by sensing means located coaxially beneath said bottom stud and fed to a micro processor which averages the values and modify the speed of the feed roller to compensate the variation sensed. This arrangement is shown in figure 3<br>
In the known arrangements, including that are described in our co pending patent applications nos 1031/MAS/2000, 1032/MAS/2000 and 1033/MAS/2000 in which the sensing and correction of the variation in the feed material in width wise direction is effected by the plurality sensing plates by establishing line contact with the feed material. For accurate sensing and correction area contact between the sensing plates and the sensing roller will be more advantageous.<br>
More over in the known arrangements , the sensing is not accurate because the contact between the sensing roller and the sensing plate is hne contact and is also expensive due to the fact they employ additional sensing roller or additional feed roller with parts for sensing the feed batt, with associated drive elements.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved input feed measuring device useful in a textile carding machine which overcomes all the drawbacks of the prior art devices.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved input feed measuring device useful in a textile carding machine which is cost effective as the device consist of parts which perform multiple functions to measure and control the feed<br><br>
material to licker-in roller thus eliminating the additional sensing roller land its associated drive arrangement.<br>
