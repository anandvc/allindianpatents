				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
	The disclosed embodiments generally relate to metal<br>
composites having high corrosion resistance and low electric contact<br>
resistance for use in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
	Electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries typically<br>
involve corrosive electrochemical reactions and high electric current flow.<br>
Some of the key components of such electrochemical devices require high<br>
corrosion resistance and very low electric resistance for long product life and<br>
minimal energy loss. Bipolar plates in a polymer electrolyte membrane<br>
(PEM) fuel cell, for example, must be cost effective, electrochemically stable,<br>
electrically conductive, hydrophilic, and stampable. Sophisticated designs<br>
with flow channels on both sides of the plate can be formed by a metal<br>
stamping process. Stainless steels posses some of those desirable<br>
characteristics including low cost and stampability. The presence of the<br>
passive oxide film on the surface of stainless steel, however, creates an<br>
extensive contact resistance with the gas diffusion medium. In addition,<br>
typical stainless steels do not have the corrosion resistance required for a<br>
bipolar plate in a demanding fuel cell. Corrosion of a bipolar plate also results<br>
in metal ion contamination that adversely affects the performance of a fuel<br>
cell. A conductive coating of noble metals, such as gold, has been used to<br><br><br>
minimize the electric contact resistance of the stainless steel. Noble metal<br>
coating adds significantly to the cost of the bipolar plate. Thermal nitriding of<br>
certain types of stainless steel has also been disclosed. Relatively expensive<br>
types of stainless steel are required in order to achieve the desired corrosion<br>
resistance and low electric contact resistance. The thermal nitriding process<br>
inherently generates a non-uniform and heterogeneous surface layer.<br>
Desired consistency and reliability may be difficult to achieve in large volume<br>
production using a thermal nitriding process. There is thus a need for a low<br>
cost, highly corrosion resistant, and highly conductive material for<br>
electrochemical devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
	One embodiment of the invention includes a metal composite<br>
comprising a low cost stainless steel interior component and a deposited<br>
nitrided metal exterior layer. The nitrided exterior layer has lower electric<br>
contact resistance and greater corrosion resistance than the stainless steel<br>
interior component. The nitrided exterior layer may be deposited on the<br>
stainless steel interior component using various metal coating/surface<br>
deposition methods including sputtering method to form a highly consistent,<br>
conductive and corrosion resistant surface layer.<br>
	In another embodiment, a bipolar plate for use in an<br>
electrochemical fuel cell comprises a stainless steel sheet material having a<br>
plurality of channels on at least one side and a deposited nitrided metal layer<br>
covering substantially the exterior surface of the stainless steel sheet. The<br>
nitrided metal has greater corrosion resistance and lower electric contact<br><br>
resistance than the stainless steel. The channels on the stainless steel sheet<br>
may be created by a conventional stamping process.<br>
	Other exemplary embodiments of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
	The following description of the embodiment(s) is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
	A metal composite with high corrosion resistance and low<br>
electric contact resistance is provided. The metal composite comprises a<br>
stainless steel interior component and a deposited nitrided metal exterior<br>
layer. The stainless steel interior component is typically a low cost metal<br>
alloy, and may not have the corrosion resistance or electric contact resistance<br>
required for use in a demanding electrochemical device. The deposited<br>
nitrided metal exterior layer strongly adheres to the stainless steel component,<br>
and typically covers substantially the surface of the stainless steel. The<br>
nitrided metal layer exhibits higher corrosion resistance and lower electric<br>
contact resistance than the stainless steel component.<br>
	Many different types of stainless steels can be used according<br>
to this invention. Typical stainless steels comprise at least 50% iron and at<br>
least 10% chromium by weight. The stainless steels may also include ferrite<br>
and austenite depending on their crystal structures and composition. It is<br>
preferred to use low cost stainless steels that can be easily made into thin<br>
sheets which can be stamped to form complicated channels. Stainless steels<br>
having higher electric conductivity and corrosion resistance are also preferred.<br>
In one embodiment, stainless steel having chromium content of at least 16%<br>
by weight is used. The stainless steel may also contain at least 6% nickel.<br>
Exemplary stainless steels may have nickel content of between 6-20% and<br>
chromium content of about 16% to about 20%. The stainless steel<br><br>
component may also include molybdenum which can further increase the<br>
corrosion resistance. In one embodiment, AISI type 304 and type 316 are<br>
used. The chemical composition of type 304 and type 316 are provided in<br>
Table 1 and Table 2 respectively:<br><br>
	Although the stainless steel may be used in various forms<br>
including rod, wire, screw, slab, tube, ball, foam, and other complex shapes,<br>
stainless steel sheets are typically used. The sheet may be further processed<br>
into other shapes. In one embodiment, the stainless steel sheet is stamped to<br>
form a plurality of channels on at least one side. The plurality of channels can<br>
be used to direct gas or other fluids that flow through an electrochemical<br>
device. The channels may also be formed by etching, or other methods<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
	A nitrided metal layer is deposited on the stainless steel<br>
component described above. The term "metal" here includes single<br>
component metal consisting of only one chemical element, metal alloys<br>
comprising 2 or more different chemical elements, and metal mixtures thereof.<br>
The nitrided metal is preferably deposited as substantially uniform layers with<br>
a thickness range from about 1 nm to about 10 Âµm. The nitrided metal layer<br><br>
has higher corrosion resistance and lower electric contact resistance than the<br>
stainless steel component.<br>
	The nitrided metal may be selected from metals comprising 0 to<br>
50% iron by weight. The nitrided metal may comprise at least one metal<br>
element that favors the formation of a nitride. The nitride forming elements<br>
according to the invention include, but are not limited to, aluminum, chromium,<br>
tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and zirconium.<br>
The nitrided metal may further comprise manganese and/or cobalt for better<br>
stabilization of the nitride. The nitrided metal preferably comprises greater<br>
than about 20% chromium and less than about 20% iron. In one embodiment,<br>
the nitrided metal is a nickel alloy comprising at least 40% nickel and at least<br>
20% chromium. In another embodiment, the nitrided metal further comprises<br>
molybdenum at 1% or greater. Examples of such nitrided metals include<br>
nitrided products of Hastelloy G-30 and G-35 alloy. The chemical<br>
compositions of Hastelloy G-30 and G-35 are provided in Table 3.<br><br>
	Any nitriding processes known to one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
may be used according to this invention. Nitridation is generally conducted at<br>
a temperature in the range of 800Â°C to 1200Â°C in pure nitrogen or 96%<br>
nitrogen-4% hydrogen mixtures, although a temperature as low as 400Â°C in<br>
ammonia environments is also suitable. There is no need to remove the<br>
passive oxide layer of the stainless steel before nitridation. Nitridation<br>
typically involves diffusion of nitrogen into metal and metal alloys at elevated<br><br>
temperatures and in controlled atmosphere to form nitrides on the surface of<br>
the metal and inside the metal. The controlled atmosphere for nitridation may<br>
include one or more of nitrogen gas, ammonia, hydrogen gas, or inert gases.<br>
A plasma assisted nitriding process can also be used at relatively low<br>
temperatures. Non-limiting examples of nitriding processes include Floe<br>
process, salt bath nitriding process, ion nitriding process, plasma assisted<br>
nitriding process, oxynitride process, ferritic nitrocarburizing process, and<br>
derivatized or combination processes thereof.<br>
	The nitrided metal can be deposited on the stainless steel<br>
interior component by various metal surface deposition or coating methods<br>
including, but not limited to, sputtering, ion plating, ion implanting, thermal<br>
spray coating, or vacuum coating. Detailed descriptions of the above<br>
methods and other similar methods can be found in Metals Handbook, 9th<br>
Edition, volume 5, "Surface cleaning, Finishing, and Coating." In comparison<br>
with thermal nitriding surface treatment, the deposition method affords a<br>
broader selection of metal materials, a more uniform layer of nitrided layer,<br>
and better consistency.<br>
	A sputtering method is preferably used to deposit the nitrided<br>
metal layer. Sputtering is a process wherein material is ejected from the<br>
surface of a solid or liquid because of the momentum exchange associated<br>
with bombardment by energetic particles. The bombarding species are<br>
generally ions of a heavy inert gas. Argon is commonly used as the inert gas.<br>
The source of ions may be an ion beam or a plasma discharge into which the<br>
material to be bombarded is immersed. In the plasma-discharging sputter<br>
coating process, a source of coating materials called target (nitrided metal or<br><br>
metal to be nitrided and coated) is placed into a vacuum chamber which is<br>
evacuated and then backfilled with a working gas, such as argon or nitrogen<br>
containing gas or gas mixture. The gas pressure is adjusted to a level to<br>
sustain plasma discharge. A negative bias is then applied to the target so that<br>
it is bombarded by positive ions from the plasma. The sputter coating<br>
chamber is typically evacuated to pressures ranging from 10-3 to 10-5 Pascal<br>
before backfilling with argon to a pressure of 0.1 to 10 Pascal. The intensity<br>
of the plasma discharge, and thus the ion flux and sputtering rate that can be<br>
achieved, depend on the shape of the cathode electrode, and on the effective<br>
use of a magnetic field to confine the plasma electrons. Simple planar<br>
electrode and other electrode configurations can be used in such sputtering<br>
method. Compared with thermal nitriding and other surface processes,<br>
sputtering can be consistently done at low temperatures, for example less<br>
than 100Â°C.<br>
	In one embodiment, an un-nitrided metal is used as the coating<br>
or surface deposition starting material (or target if sputtering method is used).<br>
The un-nitrided metal has essentially the same composition as the deposited<br>
nitrided metal layer described previously in this disclosure except that nitrogen<br>
has not been incorporated into the metal. The surface coating/deposition is<br>
conducted in a nitrogen containing gas atmosphere such that the un-nitrided<br>
metal reacts with the nitrogen atmosphere to form the corresponding nitrided<br>
metal before depositing on the stainless steel substrate. In other words,<br>
nitriding and surface coating can be achieved in a single operation. In a non-<br>
limiting example, an un-nitrided metal starting material is used as the target in<br>
a sputtering process. Nitrogen, ammonia, or ammonia/hydrogen mixture is<br><br>
used as the working gas. The stainless steel interior component is used as<br>
the substrate. The un-nitrided metal target is then converted into nitrided<br>
metal during a sputtering process by reacting with the nitrogen containing<br>
working gas before depositing on the stainless steel substrate as a nitrided<br>
metal layer.<br>
	In another embodiment, a nitrided metal is used as the target in<br>
a sputtering process. The working gas is argon or another inert gas. The<br>
nitrided metal is deposited on the stainless steel substrate with virtually no<br>
chemical reaction with the working gas.<br>
	A post-treatment may be used after the deposition of the nitrided<br>
metal layer on the stainless steel interior component. Exemplary post-<br>
treatments include, but are not limited to, post-oxidation, additional thermal<br>
nitriding treatment, thermal treatment, annealing, carbiding, polishing,<br>
cleaning, polishing, etching and the like.<br>
	The metal composite according to this invention can be used as<br>
various parts or components in electrochemical devices such as batteries and<br>
fuel cells. The metal composite can be used as fitting materials, connecting<br>
tubes, and wall materials for the electrochemical cell chamber. The metal<br>
composite can be used as an electric coupling/connecting component that<br>
may come in contact with corrosive gas or liquid. The metal composite is<br>
particularly useful as the material for a bipolar plate in an electrochemical fuel<br>
cell due to its high corrosion resistance, low cost, and low electric contact<br>
resistance. To make a bipolar plate, a low cost stainless steel sheet interior<br>
component is first selected as described previously in this disclosure. A<br>
plurality of channels are created on such stainless steel sheet by stamping or<br><br>
another suitable method. The channels serve as the flow fields for the fuel<br>
gas and oxidant gas used in the fuel cell. A nitrided metal layer is deposited<br>
on the surface of the stainless steel sheet using sputtering or one of the other<br>
methods described previously in this disclosure. A bipolar plate made<br>
according to this invention can be used in a PEM fuel cell where a<br>
perfluorinated polymer electrolyte is used. The perfluorinated polymer<br>
electrolyte contains a significant amount of acid and a small amount of highly<br>
corrosive fluoride ion. In addition, a PEM fuel cell generally operates at<br>
elevated temperatures to provide high current density and efficiency. As a<br>
result, the bipolar plate must be highly resistant to corrosion in high acid, high<br>
temperature, and fluoride ion environment. The metal composite according to<br>
this invention exhibits all the desired characteristics as a bipolar plate for PEM<br>
fuel cells.<br>
	An electrochemical fuel cell can be manufactured using the<br>
metal composite described above as the bipolar plate. An electrochemical<br>
fuel cell, especially a PEM fuel cell, is typically produced by stacking a<br>
plurality of electrode assemblies and bipolar plates in an alternating manner.<br>
The electrode assembly may comprise an anode and a cathode that are<br>
respectively disposed on opposing sides of a membrane electrolyte. Such an<br>
electrode assembly is commonly referred to as membrane electrode<br>
assembly (MEA) in the technical field. The electrode assembly and metal<br>
composite bipolar plate are joined together in an alternating manner to form a<br>
fuel cell stack. A method of joining electrode assemblies and bipolar plates to<br>
form electrochemical fuel cells is further described in D. A. Landsman and F.<br>
J. Luczak, "Handbook of Fuel cells", John Wiley and Sons (2003).<br><br>
	Example 1: Corrosion resistance and electric contact resistance<br>
of nitrided and un-nitrided alloys.<br>
	Ex-situ corrosion experiments were conducted in a relatively<br>
harsh environment typically encountered inside PEM fuel cells under cyclic<br>
conditions of relative humidity, for example, between 40 to 100% RH. Both<br>
thermally nitrided and un-nitrided Hastelloy G-30 and G-35 alloys were tested<br>
in a de-aerated simulated fuel cell solution containing 10 ppm hydrogen<br>
fluoride (HF) at pH of 3 at 80Â°C.<br>
	Potentiodynamic polarization curves of alloy G-35 and G-30<br>
were obtained and are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 respectively. Both nitrided<br>
G-35 and G-30 alloys have lower current density by one order of magnitude<br>
than their corresponding un-nitrided coupons over the tested range of<br>
electrode potential. Lower current density in the potentiodynamic polarization<br>
test indicates lower rate of corrosion.<br>
	Potentiostatic current transients were also obtained on thermally<br>
nitrided and un-nitrided G-35 and G-30 alloys at +0.6V (versus silver/silver<br>
chloride, Ag/AgCI, standard reference electrode) in argon purged simulated<br>
fuel cell solution containing 10 ppm HF at pH of 3 at 80Â°C, as shown in FIG. 3<br>
and FIG. 4. The potentiostatic testing condition is similar to the corrosion<br>
environment near a PEM fuel cell cathode. Both the nitrided G-35 and G-30<br>
alloys exhibited significantly lower current densities than their corresponding<br>
un-nitrided coupons. Again, lower current density indicates lower corrosion<br>
rate.<br>
	Electric contact resistance (ECR) of the metal samples before<br>
and after the potentiostatic test was also measured. The sample contact<br><br>
resistances were measured before and after the corrosion experiments using<br>
a four-probe technique. According to this method, the sample is sandwiched<br>
between two pieces of diffusion medium (DM), which in turn are sandwiched<br>
between two gold-plated copper electrodes. The sample is subjected to<br>
various compression pressures using a hydraulic press. A 1 A/cm2 current<br>
density is then applied and the voltage drop is measured across the diffusion<br>
media or from DM-to-sample. Thus, the contact resistance at the stainless<br>
steel/DM interface can be measured at "stack" compression pressures.<br>
	The results are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Table 3,<br>
the nitrided G-30 and G-35 alloys have much lower electric contact resistance<br>
than their corresponding un-nitrided alloys. Additionally, nitrided alloys<br>
showed very little change in ECR after the corrosion test while ECR of un-<br>
nitrided alloys increased significantly under the same condition.<br><br>
	The above experiments demonstrate that a nitrided alloy has<br>
higher corrosion resistance and lower electric contact resistance than its<br>
corresponding un-nitrided alloy. The nitrided alloys would be suitable as the<br>
exterior layer of a polar plate in a fuel cell.<br>
	Example 2: Electrochemical fuel cell having a nitrided alloy<br>
bipolar plate.<br><br>
	Single fuel cell tests were carried out on machined and thermally<br>
nitrided G-35 (anode and cathode) metallic plates. A Global Tech. test station<br>
controlled by Scribner software was used to control the fuel cell potential<br>
and/or the current. A Gore 5051 membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a<br>
25 Âµm thickness and a 0.4 mg cm-2 (each side) platinum loading was used.<br>
The experiments were done using hydrogen and air at a pressure of 25 psig,<br>
cyclic relative humidity and at a temperature of 80Â°C.<br>
	Nearly 900 durability hours were collected on the nitrided G-35<br>
alloy with little change in cell voltage or current density as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The results indicate that such nitrided alloys as an exterior layer for a bipolar<br>
plate would function very well in a fuel cell. Furthermore, ICP (Inductively<br>
Coupled Plasma) metal analysis of the product water collected from the fuel<br>
cell showed below detection limit values for the total metal ion contaminants.<br>
The ICP result further confirmed the robustness of the nitrided alloy as an<br>
exterior layer of a bipolar plate.<br>
	Example 3: Metal Composite Bipolar Plate.<br>
	An AISI type 304 stainless steel sheet of 100 Âµm thick is<br>
stamped to create straight gas flow channels. A Hastelloy G-35 alloy plate is<br>
thermally nitrided in nitrogen gas or in a nitrogen/hydrogen gas mixture at<br>
about 1000 - 1200Â°C for about 2 - 8 hours. The stamped stainless steel as a<br>
substrate and the nitrided G-35 alloy foil as a target are placed in a sputtering<br>
chamber. The chamber is evacuated to about 10"5 Pascal pressure, and<br>
backfilled with inert argon gas to about 0.1 to 10 Pascal pressure. Stable<br>
plasma is generated in the chamber. A negative bias is then applied to the<br>
nitrided G-35 alloy target to initiate the sputtering process. A relatively<br><br>
uniform layer of nitrided G-35 alloy of about 1 nm to about 3 Âµm is deposited<br>
on the outer surface of the stainless steel depending on the sputtering time.<br>
Thus a metal composite bipolar plate comprising a low cost stainless steel<br>
interior component and a nitrided alloy exterior layer is obtained. The bipolar<br>
plate can be then integrated with MEAs to form a single fuel cell unit and<br>
multiple fuel cell stack.<br>
	Hastelloy G-30 has a composition including 28-31.5% Cr, 43%<br>
Ni, and 13-17% Fe by weight percent. Hastelloy G-35 has a composition<br>
including 33.2% Cr, 58% Ni and 
stainless steel has a composition including 18-20% Cr, 8-10.5% Ni and 60%<br>
Fe by weight percent. AISI type 316 stainless steel has a composition<br>
including 16-18% Cr, 10-14% Ni and 60% Fe by weight percent.<br>
	The above description of embodiments of the invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and, thus, variations thereof are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
