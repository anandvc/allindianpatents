COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
""FEED REGULATORY BOOT ASSEMBLY"<br>
GARWARE HARISH RAJARAM C/o 254, Dattasudha, Road No.5, Sindh Society, Aundh, PUNE-411 007. Maharashtra State, India Indian National<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
13 AUG 2004<br>
12-8-2004<br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to feed regulatory boot assembly wherein feeding material is uniformly and optimally distributed amongst the poultry.<br>
Background of the invention and the prior art:<br>
In prior art there was no such boot assembly available to feed the poultry birds. Earlier and today in the convention cage system with motorized or manual feeding trolley; the outlets are just open or may be these are attached to sliding valves. These sliding valves do control the feed flow from trolley but do not control the same precisely. It also does not control the overflow of feed as feed comes out of the discharge tube in both forward and backward movement of the trolley.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a feed regulatory boot assembly, which distributes the feed to the poultry uniformly and optimally and as a result it ensures the cost saving and high profit to the user/ farmer.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a feed regulatory boot assembly, which would allow only required amount of the feed to be released into the trough that would minimize the feed wastage.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a feed regulatory boot assembly wherein excess feed is not allowed to be left in the trough resulting into fresh delivery of the feed to the poultry birds everyday.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a feed regulatory boot assembly, which provides fresh and optimum feed to the poultry birds and ensures proper digestion.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a feed regulatory boot wherein the feed<br>
is distributed uniformly amongst the poultry birds. The feed regulatory boot<br>
is consisting of inner and outer boot.<br>
The feed is initially stored in the outer boot. It has a sliding flap at one end,<br>
which helps maintaining the desired feed level inside the said feed trough.<br>
This ensures uniform feed distribution through out the feed trough.<br>
The feed is dispensed through the opening along with the length of feed<br>
trough while traveling in one direction.<br>
The conventional feeding systems only dispenses the feed whereas stated<br>
'Feed regulatory boot assembly' collects the old left over feed in the trough<br>
and then mixes it with the new feed and redistributes in equally quantity. It<br>
also cleans the feed trough with the help of a cleaning brush while traveling<br>
from one end to the other and only dispenses feed while traveling in one<br>
direction to  ensure  equal  feed  for  all  birds.  On return trip  the boot<br>
automatically closes the hopper outlet hence the balance feed in the hopper is<br>
not dispensed and save for next feeding.<br>
This feature ensures that any leftover feed in the feed hopper is not dispensed<br>
during return trip and hence all the poultry birds get equal quantity of feed<br>
and also there is no wastage of the same.<br><br><br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems<br>
and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are<br>
overcome by the present invention as described below in the preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
This invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings (Figure 1, 2 and 3)<br>
through out which like reference letters indicate corresponding parts in the<br>
various figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows the feed regulatory boot assembly placed on the feed trough<br>
traveling along the trough distributing the feed.<br>
Figure 2 shows the individual parts of the feed regulatory boot assembly<br>
including the sliding flap.<br>
Figure  3  shows  the  various  positions  of  the  sliding  flaps  during  its<br>
functioning.<br>
The assembly according to the present invention comprises an inner boot (1) and an outer boot (2) wherein an inner boot is removably placed into an outer boot.<br>
The complete assembly rests on the feeding trough (7) and travels inside the said trough when feeding operation goes on. The feed hopper outlet tube (4) is attached to inner boot with the help of two rods (5) placed along the length of the inner boot (1). The upper end of the feed hopper outlet tube is attached to the traveling feed hopper, which carries the feed (3). The arrangement of inner boot (1), feed hopper outlet tube (4) and rods (5) is such that the said feed hopper outlet tube travels over the said inner boot but in between the<br><br><br>
two ends of the said boot (1). The inner boot (1) is fitted to the traveling feed hopper (10).<br>
One end of the said outer boot (2) is provided with the sliding flap (8). This flap has a vertical sliding plate. When this plate is moved upwards and downwards, the flap opening increases and decreases respectively. The dispensed feed is initially stored in the outer boot. The said opening of the outer boot determines the quantity of dispensed feed. The sliding flap helps maintaining the desired feed level inside the said feed trough (7). This ensures uniform feed distribution through out the feed trough. The complete assembly rests on the said feed trough (7) and travels inside the trough when the trolley (not shown in the figure) is moved over the cage row (not shown in the figure).<br>
The inner boot has a sliding mechanism. The said inner boot is provided with a rectangular opening (9) on the same end of the inner boot where said sliding flap has been provided. The said opening and the feed hopper outlet tube arrangement work in such manner that when the feed hopper outlet tube is brought above the said opening (9), the feed is delivered through the opening (9). When the trolley along with the feed hopper travels, the outer boot pushes the inner boot to one side of the feed hopper. Every time when the traveling direction changes, this inner boot with the help of the outer boot slides to the other side of the feed hopper. As mentioned earlier, the inner boot has an opening (9) in the bottom. The feed is dispensed through this opening along with the length of feed trough. While traveling in the opposite direction, the said inner boot slides to the other position, which does not have any opening. Hence no feed is dispensed while traveling in this direction.<br><br><br><br>
Thus feed is dispensed while traveling in one direction and stops while traveling in reverse direction. This feature ensures that any leftover feed in the feed hopper is not dispensed during return trip and hence; all the poultry birds get equal quantity of feed and also there is no wastage of the same.<br>
A cleaning brush (6) is also attached to the feed regulatory boot assembly, on the end where the sliding flap has been provided. The said cleaning brush (6) cleans the feed trough and also brings the feed at the right feeding position in the said feed trough (7).<br>
12 AUG 2008<br><br>
While the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, those will understand it skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for components thereof with out departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adopt the particular situation or materials to the teachings of the invention without departing from essential scope thereof.<br>
To sum up following advantages are achieved by this invention.<br>
1.	Feed wastage is controlled which saves money for the farmers/users.<br>
2.	Only required amount of feeding is done and hence optimum use of feed is possible.<br>
3.	Excess feed is not allowed to be left in the trough, which gets spoiled if left out for several days/hours.<br>
4.	Birds always get fresh feed and digestion is proper.<br>
5.	Feed level throughout the trough is maintained which results in uniform feeding to the birds.<br>
6.	The features of the invention ensure the users/farmers that they can save money or can increase their profits by avoiding feed wastage or using it on optimum basis.<br><br>
Statement of claims:<br>
I claim<br>
1.
