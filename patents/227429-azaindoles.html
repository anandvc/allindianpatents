AZAINDOLES<br>
This invention is directed to substituted azaindoles, their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their pharmaceutical use in the treatment of disease states capable of being modulated by the inhibition of the protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases participate in the signalling events which control the activation, growth and differentiation of cells in response to extracellular mediators and to changes in the environment. In general, these kinases fall into several groups; those which preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and those which preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues [S.K.Hanks and T.Hunter, FASEB. J., 1995, 9, pages 576-596]. The serine/threonine kinases include for example, protein kinase C isoforms [A.C.Newton, J. Biol. Chem., 1995,270, pages 28495-2849S] and a group of cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdc2 [J.Pines, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 1995,18, pages 195-197]. The tyrosine kinases include membrane-spanning growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor [S.Iwashita and M.Kobayashi, Cellular Signalling, 1992, 4, pages 123-132], and cytosolic non-receptor kinases such as p56tck, p59fYn, ZAP-70 and csk kinases [C.Chan et. al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1994,12, pages 555-592].<br>
Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many diseases resulting from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or indirectly, for example by failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase, related for example to mutation, over-expression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme; or by over- or underproduction of cytokines or growth factors also participating in the transduction of signals upstream or downstream of the kinase. In all of these instances, selective inhibition of the action of the kinase might be expected to have a beneficial effect.<br>
Syk is a 72-kDa cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells and is an essential element in several cascades that couple antigen receptors to cellular responses. Thus, Syk plays a pivotal role in signalling of the high affinity IgE receptor, FceRl, in mast cells and in receptor antigen signalling in T and B lymphocytes. The signal transduction pathways present in mast, T and B cells have common features. The ligand binding domain of the receptor lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. However, they interact with transducing subunits that contain immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) [M.Reth, Nature, 1989,338, pages 383-384]. These motifs are present in both the P and y subunits of the FceRl, in the £-subunit the of T cell receptor (TCR) and in the IgGa and IgG p<br><br>
subunits of the B cell receptor (BCR). [N.S.van Oers and A.Weiss, Seminars in Immunology, 1995, 7, pages 227-236] Upon binding of antigen and multimerization, the IT AM residues are phosphorylated by protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family. Syk belongs to a unique class of tyrosine kinases that have two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C terminal catalytic domain. These SH2 domains bind with high affinity to ITAMs and this SH2 -mediated association of Syk with an activated receptor stimulates Syk kinase activity and localises Syk to the plasma membrane.<br>
In Syk deficient mice, mast cell degranulation is inhibited, suggesting that this is an important target for the development of mast cell stabilising agents [P.S.Costello, Oncogene, 1996,13, pages 2595-2605]. Similar studies have demonstrated a critical role for Syk in BCR and TCR signalling [A.M.Cheng, Nature, 1995,378, pages 303-306, (1995) and D.H.Chu et al., Immunological Reviews, 1998,165, pages 167-180].   Syk also appears to be involved in eosinophil survival in response to IL-5 and GM-CSF [S.Yousefi et al., J. Exp. Med., 1996,183, pages 1407-1414]. Despite the key role of Syk in mast cell, BCR and T cell signalling, little is known about the mechanism by which Syk transmits downstream effectors. Two adaptor proteins, BLNK (B cell Linker protein, SLP-65) and SLP-76 have been shown to be substrates of Syk in B cells and mast cells respectively and have been postulated to interface Syk with downstream effectors [M.Ishiai et al., Immunity, 1999,10, pages 117-125 and L.R.Hendricks-Taylor et al., J.Biol. Chem, 1997,272, pages 1363-1367]. In addition Syk appears to play an important role in the CD40 signalling pathway, which plays an important role in B cell proliferation [M.Faris et al., J.Exp. Med., 1994,179, pages 1923-1931].<br>
Syk is further involved in the activation of platelets stimulated via the low-affinity IgG receptor (Fc gamma-RIIA) or stimulated by collagen [F.Yanaga et al., Biochem. J., 1995,311, (Pt. 2) pages 471-478].<br>
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways. FAK colocalizes with integrins in focal contact sites and FAK activation and its tyrosine phosphorylation have been shown in many cell types to be dependent on integrins binding to their extracellular ligands. Results from several studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors could be useful in cancer treatment. For example, FAK-deficient cells migrate poorly in response to chemotactic signals and overexpression of C-terminal domain of FAK blocks cell spreading as well as chemotactic migration (Sieg et al, J. Cell Science,1999, 112,2677-2691; Richardson A. and Parsons T., Cell, 1997, 97,221-231); in addition, tumor cells treated with FAK antisense oligonucleotides lost their attachment and underwent apoptosis (Xu<br><br>
et al, Cell Growth Differ. 1996,4, 413-418). FAK has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate, breast, thyroid, colon and lung cancers. The level of expression of FAK is directly correlated with tumors demonstrating the most aggressive phenotype.<br>
Angiogenesis or the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting from the preexisting vasculature is of central importance for embryonic development and organogenesis. Abnormal enhanced neovascularization is observed in rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and during tumor development (Folkman, Nat. Med., 1995,1, 27-31.). Angiogenesis is a complex multistage process which includes activation, migration, proliferation and survival of endothelial cells. Extensive studies in the field of tumor angiogenesis in the past two decades have identified a number of therapeutic targets including kinases, proteases and integrins resulting in the discovery of many new anti-angiogenic agents, including KDR inhibitors some of which are currently under clinical evaluation (Jekunen, et al Cancer Treatment Rev. 1997 ,23,263-286.). Angiogenesis inhibitors may be used in frontline, adjuvant and even preventive settings for the emergence or regrowth of malignancies.<br>
Several proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly have been identified in yeast and drosophila. Disruption of these proteins results in chromosome missegregation and monopolar or disrupted spindles. Among these kinases are the Ipll and aurora kinases from S.cerevisiae and drosophila respectively, which are required for centrosome separation and chromosome segregation. One human homologue of yeast Ipll was recently cloned and characterized by different laboratories. This kinase termed Aurora2, STK15 or BTAK belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family. Bischoff et al showed that Aurora2 is oncogenic and is amplified in human colorectal cancers (EMBO J, 1998,17,3052-3065). It has also been exemplified in cancers involving epithelial tumors such as breast cancer.<br>
We have now found a novel group of substituted azaindoles, which have valuable pharmaceutical properties, in particular, the ability to inhibit protein kinases, more particularly, the ability to selectively inhibit Syk kinase.<br><br>

Alternatively, an ester of a compound of formula (I) containing a carboxy group may be convertible by hydrolysis in vivo to the parent molecule.<br>
Suitable esters of compounds of formula (I) containing a hydroxy group are, for example acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene-bis-P-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates and quinates.<br>

Where the compound of the invention contains a carboxy group, or a sufficiently acidic bioisostere, base addition salts may be formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free acid form. The bases which can be used to prepare the base addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose cations are<br><br>
non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the cations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including those derived from alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, within the scope of the invention include those derived from the following bases: sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline,<br>
N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention are basic, and such compounds are useful in the form of the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.<br>
Acid addition salts are a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention include those derived from mineral acids and organic acids, and include hydrohalides, e.g. hydrochlorides and hydrobromides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, sulfamates, acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene-bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methane-sulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates and quinates.<br>
As well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, salts of compounds of the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for example by exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by tec,,,,i'i,,"&gt;e «"»•' known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>

According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a human or animal patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of a protein kinase inhibitor (e.g. Syk, FAK, KDR or Aurora2) for example<br><br>
conditions as hereinbefore described, which comprises the administration to the patient of an effective amount of compound of the invention or a composition containing a compound of the invention. "Effective amount" is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity a protein kinase, such as Syk, FAK, KDR or Aurora2, and thus producing the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
References herein to treatment should be understood to include prophylactic therapy as well as treatment of established conditions.<br>
The present invention also includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of the compounds of the invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means. In practice compounds of the present invention may generally be administered parenterally, topically, rectally, orally or by inhalation, especially by the oral route.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients.    The adjuvants comprise, inter alia, diluents, sterile aqueous media and the various non-toxic organic solvents. The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups, and can contain one or more agents chosen from the group comprising sweeteners, flavourings, colourings, or stabilisers in order to obtain pharmaceutically acceptable preparations. The choice of vehicle and the content of active substance in the vehicle are generally determined in accordance with the solubility and chemical properties of the active compound, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice. For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc may be used for preparing tablets.    To prepare a capsule, it is advantageous to use lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are used they can contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension. Diluents such as sucrose, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol and chloroform or mixtures thereof may also be used.<br><br>
For parenteral administration, emulsions, suspensions or solutions of the products according to the invention in vegetable oil, for example sesame oil, groundnut oil or olive oil, or aqueous-organic solutions such as water and propylene glycol, injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are used. The solutions of the salts of the products according to the invention are especially useful for administration by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The aqueous solutions, also comprising solutions of the salts in pure distilled water, may be used for intravenous administration with the proviso that their pH is suitably adjusted, that they are judiciously buffered and rendered isotonic with a sufficient quantity of glucose or sodium chloride and that they are sterilised by heating, irradiation or microfiltration.<br>
For topical administration, gels (water or alcohol based), creams or ointments containing compounds of the invention may be used. Compounds of the invention may also be incorporated in a gel or matrix base for application in a patch, which would allow a controlled release of compound through the transdermal barrier.<br>
For administration by inhalation compounds of the invention may be dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier for use in a nebuliser or a suspension or solution aerosol, or may be absorbed or adsorbed onto a suitable solid carrier for use in a dry powder inhaler.<br>
Solid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories formulated in accordance with known methods and containing at least one compound of the invention.<br>
The percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. The dose employed will be determined by the physician, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient. In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.001 to about 50, preferably about 0.001 to about 5, mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.001 to about 10, preferably 0.01 to 1, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. In each particular case, the doses will be determined in accordance with the factors distinctive to the subject to be treated, such as age, weight, general state of health and other characteristics which can influence the efficacy of the medicinal product.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient.   Generally, the active product may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day. Of course, for some patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature, for example those described by R.C.Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH publishers, 1989.<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions.   Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T.W. Greene and P.G.M.Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined hereinbefore at a temperature at about -15°C to about room temperature. This procedure is particularly suitable for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) where R1 is optionally substituted N-methylindol-3-yl, R2 and R3 are hydrogen and X1 is N or CH.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 and X1 are as hereinbefore defined may also be prepared by application or adaptation of the procedure described by Chang and Bag, J.Org.Chem., 1995,21, pages 7030-7032, for example reaction of compounds of formula (V):-<br><br>
wherein Rl is as defined hereinbefore. The coupling reaction may conveniently be carried out for example in the presence of a complex metal catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and sodium bicarbonate, in aqueous dimethylformamide at a temperature up to reflux temperature.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be prepared by interconversion of other compounds of the invention.<br>
Thus, for example, compounds of formula (I) containing a carboxy group may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding esters. The hydrolysis may conveniently be carried out by alkaline hydrolysis using a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. lithium hydroxide, or an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate, in the presence of an aqueous/organic solvent<br><br>
mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxan, tetrahydrofuran or methanol, at a temperature from about ambient to about reflux. The hydrolysis of the esters may also be carried out by acid hydrolysis using an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, in the presence of an aqueous/inert organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature from about 50°C to about 80°C.<br>
As another example compounds of formula (I) containing a carboxy group may be prepared by acid catalysed removal of the tert-butyl group of the corresponding tert-butyl esters using standard reaction conditions, for example reaction with trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature at about room temperature.<br>
As another example compounds of formula (I) containing a carboxy group may be prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding benzyl esters. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of ammonium formate and a suitable metal catalyst, e.g. palladium, supported on an inert carrier such as carbon, preferably in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol and at a temperature at about reflux temperature. The reaction may alternatively be carried out in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, e.g. platinum or palladium optionally supported on an inert carrier such as carbon, preferably in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
As another example of the interconversion process, compounds of formula (I) containing a -C(=0)-NYl Y2 group may be prepared by coupling compounds of formula (I) containing a carboxy group with an amine of formula HNY^2 to give an amide bond using standard peptide coupling procedures, for example coupling in the presence of 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and triethylamine (or diisopropylethylamine) in tetrahydrofuran (or dimethylformamide) at room temperature. The coupling may also be brought about by reaction of compounds of formula (I) containing a carboxy group with N-{(dimethylamino)(lH-l,2,3-triazaolo[4,5-b]pyridin-l-yl)methylene}-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide in the presence of a suitable base, such as diisopropylethylamine, in an inert solvent, such as dimethylformamide, and at a temperature at about room temperature, followed by reaction with an amine of formula HNY1 Y2 (ammonium chloride can be used for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) containing a -C(=0)-NH2 group).<br>
As another example of the interconversion process, compounds of formula (I) containing a -CH2OH group may be prepared by the reduction of corresponding compounds of formula (I)<br>
containing a -CHO or -CO2R7 (in which R7 is lower alkyl) group. For example, the reduction<br><br>
may conveniently be carried out by means of reaction with lithium aluminium hydride, in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and at a temperature from about room temperature to about reflux temperature.<br>

IN VIVO TEST PROCEDURES<br>
1.   Inhibition of antigen induced airway inflammation - single-and multiple-day oral dosing studies.<br>
Compounds of the invention were assessed in the allergic Brown Norway rat. The models used in these in vivo studies mimic relevant pathological features of allergic airway disease. These studies demonstrated that compounds of the invention inhibit the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the airways allergic twenty-four hours after antigen inhalation. The endpoints measured included the appearance of inflammatory leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung digest fluid, and in the tissue as quantified by histopathological analysis.<br>
Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On day 30, the rats were exposed to a 1% aerosol of ovalbumin for a period of 30 minutes. The animals were then returned to housing.<br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Test drug was administered orally 1 hour before the initiation of the allergen inhalation<br>
challenge. Four hours after the end of the antigen inhalation challenge, a second dose of drug<br><br>
was given or"""  Doses of compound were administered at half log divisions between 3 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
In separate studies drug was administered two times daily for 4 days before the inhalation of antigen. The final dose of compound in these studies was also given at 4 hours after the antigen challenge.<br>
Protocol for Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAD recovery<br>
Twenty-four hours after the antigen inhalation challenge, cells were recovered from the airway lumen by bronchoalveolar lavage by euthanizing the animals, and washing the lungs with three 5-ml aliquots of RPMI/FCS. The washes were allowed to remain in the lungs for 30 seconds each before gentile removal. The three samples were pooled and total and differential white blood cell counts were measured on BAL samples. An ARGOS system was used to assess total cells and differential cell counts were made using light microscopy of Wright-Giemsa stained cytocentrifuge preparations.<br>
Protocol for Histopathology of lungs<br>
Immediately after BAL, the lungs were insufflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), at 30cm water pressure. The lungs were removed and placed in jars of 10% NBF. After fixation in 10% NBF for a minimum of 24 hours the lungs were processed through graded alcohol and into wax locks. The lungs were blocked longitudinally and one 2 |im longitudinal section for each animal was cut at the level of the main bronchi. Sections were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Pathological assessment of sections was performed and a grading for the bronchiolar epithelium and sub-mucosa was assigned<br>
Protocol for lung digest<br>
In some studies the lug itself was digested, to recover the inflammatory cells localized within the tissue. In these studies the cells were obtained by perfusing the left lung with RPMI/FCS in order to remove the blood pool of cells immediately after BAL. In the se studies the he right hand side of the lung was insufflated and fixed with buffered formalin for histopathological analysis. The lung to undergo digestion was standardized across animals by taking a 300mg the section of the lung tissue and exposing it to collagenase digestion. This freed the cells within the lung tissue and allowed their recovery. Total and differential cell counts were performed on these recovered cells.<br><br>
Results<br>
(i)     Following antigen inhalation there was a significant increase in the numbers of eosinophils<br>
and neutrophils in the non-drug treated groups. His was evidenced by the significant increase in<br>
BAL and tissue digest eosinophil and neutrophil numbers as well as the lung histopathology<br>
score.<br>
(ii)    No changes in BAL macrophage/monocyte cell numbers were observed with antigen<br>
challenge or with any drug treatment.<br>
(iii)   The compound as able to inhibit significantly the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils<br>
24 hours after antigenic challenge compared to the non-drug treated controls as assessed in all<br>
three methods noted above. The dose range for efficacy was between 3 and 100 mg/kg po.<br>
(iv)   In the multiple-day drug administration studies, there was quantitatively similar inhibition<br>
of the cellular influx as seen in the single day studies.<br>
These results indicate that compounds of the invention demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity when given prophylacticlly in a rat model of antigen induced leukocyte infiltration<br>

Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On day 30, the rats were exposed to a 1% aerosol of ovalbumin for a period of 30 minutes. The animals were then returned to housing.<br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Test drug was administered four times intraperitoneally rather than po. The dosing regimen<br>
was 30 min pre-challenge and 2,4 and 8 hours after allergen inhalation challenge.<br>
Protocol for Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) recovery<br>

In the se studies the he right hand side of the lung was insufflated and fixed with buffered formalin for histopathological analysis. The lung to undergo digestion was standardized across animals by taking a 300mg the section of the lung tissue and exposing it to collagenase digestion. This freed the cells within the lung tissue and allowed their recovery. Total and differential cell counts were performed on these recovered cells.<br>
Results<br>
(i)     Following antigen inhalation there was a significant increase in the numbers of eosinophils<br>
and neutrophils in the non-drug treated groups. This was evidenced by the significant increase<br>
in BAL and tissue digest eosinophil and neutrophil numbers as well as the lung histopathology<br>
score.<br>
(ii)    Compounds of the invention were able to inhibit significantly the infiltration of neutrophils<br>
and eosinophils 24 hours after antigenic challenge compared to the non-drug<br>
treated controls as assessed in all three methods noted above. The dose range for efficacy was<br>
between 3 and 100 mg/kg po.<br>
These results indicate that compounds of the invention demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity when given prophylacticlly in a rat model of antigen induced leukocyte infiltration either orally or intraperitoneally.<br>
3. Inhibition of acute antigen induced bronchoconstriction in the allergic rat<br><br>
Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On the day of study the rats were surgically prepared for the measurement of pulmonary mechanics and mechanically ventilated. After a five-minute equilibration period, the animals received a bolus of ovalbumin (1 mg per rat). The animals were then followed for 15 minutes and peak changes from base line resistance recorded as the response to antigen challenge.<br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Test drug was given either p.o. or i.p. 24 and 2 hours before the iv bolus injection of ovalbumin.<br>
The range of compound delivered in these studies was 10-100 mg/kg po.<br>
Results<br>
Following antigen challenge in the non-drug treated and budesonide control-treated animals there was a significant increase in the airway resistance over baseline. In contrast, compounds of the invention significantly inhibited the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction.<br>
These results indicate that compounds of the invention inhibit antigen-induced bronchoconstriction.<br>
4. Inhibition of Sephadex induced rat lung edema and cvtokine gene expression in the allergic rat<br>
Protocol for Sephadex administration<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (400 g), were dosed i.t. with vehicle (saline) or Sephadex (5mg/kg) in a<br>
dose volume of 1 ml/kg under halothane anesthesia (4% in oxygen for 3 min).<br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Drug was administered p.o. 1 hour before and 5 hours after Sephadex i.t in a dose volume of<br>
lml/kg..<br>
Protocol for Assessing edema as an endpoint<br>
Twenty-four hours after Sephadex administration the animals were sacrificed with Euthatal (lml/kg i.p.), the heart and lungs removed en bloc. An increase in wet weight was used as an index of edema. The wet weight determined and then corrected for lOOg initial body weight.<br>
Protocol for RT-PCR (measurement of cvtokine gene expression)<br><br>
RNA was isolated from lung tissue by a guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction technique. RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using AMV reverse transcriptase. cDNA for IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin and GAPDH (control gene) were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide sequences synthesized (Gibco) from published sequences.<br>
The PCR reagents were overlaid with mineral oil and amplification was carried out through 25-35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute, annealing at 55-65°C for 1 minute and extending at 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products, stained with ethidium bromide, were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels to visualize cDNA bands.<br>
Bands of each target fragment were visualized by ultraviolet transillumination and photographed. Photographs were scanned on a densitometer and integrated optical densities (OD x mm) of each band were calculated by image analysis software (Imagemaster, Pharmacia). For each animal, the amount of each cytokine PCR product was normalized to the amount of GAPDH PCR product.<br>
Results<br>
(i)     Sephadex instillation alone evoked a significant edema of 32%<br>
(ii)    Compounds of the invention inhibited the edema in a dose dependant manner by at doses<br>
of 10,30 and lOOmg/kg<br>
(iii)   Sephadex caused an increased expression of the Th-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 together with<br>
the CC chemokine eotaxin in the lung 24 hours after challenge. There was a trend toward an<br>
increase in the expression of IL-5 and eotaxin mRNA.<br>
(iv)   L-4 mRNA expression was dose dependently inhibited by compounds of the invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention inhibit Sephadex induced lung edema in the rat, which is associated with a reduction in Sephadex induction of IL-4.<br>
5. Inhibition of antigen-induced histamine release in the allergic Brown-Norway rat<br>
Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On the day of study, the rats were surgically prepared for the infusion of antigen. After a five-minute equilibration period, the animals received a bolus of ovalbumin (1 mg per rat). Blood samples were taken 2 minutes after ovalbumin challenge and plasma histamine levels were measured using a histamine ELISA.<br><br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Test drug was given i.p. 30 min before ovalbumin challenge. Only a single 30 mg/kg i.p.<br>
concentration was used in this study<br>
Results<br>
Following antigen challenge, the Syk Kinase inhibitors significantly inhibited the antigen-induced histamine release in comparison to the vehicle treated group.<br>
These results indicate that compounds of the invention inhibit antigen-induced histamine release.<br>
6. Inhibition of ED-1+ alveolar macrophages in rat lung tissue<br>
Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On day 30, the rats were exposed to a 1% aerosol of ovalbumin for a period of 30 minutes. The animals were then returned to housing.<br>
Protocol for Dosing<br>
Test drug was given either p.o. or i.p. 24 and 2 hours before the iv bolus injection of ovalbumin.<br>
The range of compound delivered in these studies was 10-100 mg/kg po.<br>
Protocol for EDI quantification<br>
Alveolar macrophages were quantified following immunostaining with ED-1 antibody in<br>
paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections.<br>
Results<br>
(i)     Ovalbumin challenge resulted in a 10-fold increase in the number of ED1+ macrophages in<br>
the alveolar bed.<br>
(ii)    Inhibition of Syk Kinase significantly reduced the ovalbumin-induced increase in EDI<br>
alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
Oral administration of compounds of the invention produced a dose-related reduction in ED-1+ alveolar macrophages following ovalbumin challenge.<br><br>
7. Inhibition of antigen-induced airway neutrophilia in the Brown-Norway rat<br>
Protocol for sensitization and challenge<br>
Brown Norway rats were sensitized on days 0,12 and 21 with ovalbumin (lOOug, i.p) administered with aluminum hydroxide (100 mg, i.p). On day 30, the rats were exposed to a 1% aerosol of ovalbumin for a period of 30 minutes. The animals were then returned to housing.<br>
Protocol for Drug dosing<br>
One hour before antigen challenge, rats were dosed orally. The range of compound delivered in<br>
these studies was 1-100 mg/kg po.<br>
Protocol for cell analysis<br>
Four hours after challenge, cells were recovered from the airway lumen by bronchoalveolar lavage (RPMI/FCS as previously described). Immediately after lavage, lungs were perfused with RPMI/FCS to remove the blood pool of cells. 300 mg of tissue was chopped and cells were recovered by enzymatic (collagenase) disaggregation. Differential cell counts were made by light microscopy of stained cytocentrifuge preparations stained with Wright-Giemsa stain.<br>
Results<br>
(i)     Four hours after antigen challenge a significant increase in neutrophils was observed in<br>
both the BAL and lung tissue.<br>
(ii)    The ovalbumin-induced increase in neutrophils in the BAL, but not the lung tissue, was<br>
significantly suppressed by compounds of the invention.<br><br><br>
