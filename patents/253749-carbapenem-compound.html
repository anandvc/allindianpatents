				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel carbapenem compound which is a<br>
production intermediate of 2-(substituted mercapto)-1β-methyl-carbapenem antibiotics.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-319343, filed<br>
November 2,2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since the discovery of thienamycin in 1976, research on the synthesis of<br>
carbapenem antibiotics has been vigorously carried out. Many carbapenem compounds<br>
which have excellent antibacterial activity, such as imipenum, have been discovered.<br>
However, many of these carbapenem compounds have the drawback that they are easily<br>
metabolized by renal dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I)<br>
[0003]<br>
Thus, research for improving stability against DHP-I has been vigorously<br>
carried and in 1984, the research group at Merck and Company Incorporated developed a<br>
1β-methyl carbapenem compound that, while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity,<br>
was also chemically and physically stable as well as having excellent resistance against<br>
DHP-I.<br>
[0004]<br>
Many research groups have since developed 2-(substituted mercapto)-lβ-<br><br>
methyl-carbapenem antibiotics in which a substituted mercapto is introduced at the 2-<br>
position of the carbapenem skeleton and some of these are in practical use.<br>
As such compounds, L-627 (biapenem) represented by formula shown below:<br><br><br>
have been developed, for example.<br>
Conventionally, these 2-(substituted mercapto)-1β-methyl-carbapenem<br>
antibiotics are produced by the generally known method represented by reaction scheme<br>
shown below:.<br><br>
In formula, R1 represents a pharmaceutically-acceptable ester group or a<br>
carboxyl group protective group that can be easily removed; R2 and R3 each represents,<br>
independently, a phenyl group that may be substituted with a halogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group, a cyano group, a nitro group, or the like, a C1 to C6 alkyl group that may be<br>
substituted with a halogen atom, or the like; and X represents a halogen atom such as<br>
chlorine and bromine.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
In other words, after deriving the phosphoric acid ester compound represented<br>
by formula (I) by reacting the compound represented by formula (II) with the compound<br>
represented by formula (III) in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a<br>
base such as diisopropylethylamine, the final product is obtained by further reacting with<br>
mercaptans.<br><br>
In above formulas, R1 represents a pharmaceutically-acceptable ester group or a<br>
carboxyl group protective group that can be easily removed; R2 and R3 each represents,<br>
independently, a phenyl group that may be substituted with a halogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group, a cyano group, a nitro group, or the like, a C1 to C6 alkyl group that may be<br><br>
substituted with a halogen atom, or the like; and X represents a halogen atom such as<br>
chlorine and bromine.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the above production method, the compound represented by formula (I) is an<br>
important production intermediate in the production of 2-(substituted mercapto)-lβ-<br>
methyl-carbapenem antibiotics. It is preferable that this compound, particularly in<br>
situations where industrial-scale production is assumed, has high purity, is easily<br>
handable, and is in a crystalline form.<br><br>
With respect to the compound represented by formula (I) shown above, Patent<br>
Document 1 discloses that the compound represented by formula (lb) (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "compound (Ib)") can be isolated in a crystalline form, for example.<br>
Also, this document discloses that the compound has excellent stability in the crystalline<br>
form and that it is useful as a bulk raw material. However, there are the problems that,<br>
by the reacted substrate, the reactivity of the diphenyl phosphoric acid part of the<br>
compound (Ib) is relatively poor and the ability to remove phosphoric acid is low.<br>
[0020]<br>
Also, a p-nitrobenzyl group is used as the carboxyl group protective group in the<br>
compound (Ib). This group can be generally easily removed by a normal catalytic<br>
hydrogen reduction method using palladium carbon as the catalyst. However, the<br><br>
danger of fire from the filtration of palladium carbon and the use of hydrogen in an<br>
industrial process is high and thus the use of a p-nitrobenzyl group is unpreferable.<br>
Furthermore, production costs are relatively high when a p-nitrobenzyl group is used. A<br>
cheaper, more efficient, and stably-removable protective group is thus desired as the<br>
carboxyl group protective group instead of a p-nitrobenzyl group.<br>
[0021]<br>
Related to the present invention, although Patent Document 2 discloses an<br>
example where R1 is an alkyl group in formula (I) shown above, a specific synthesis<br>
example is hardly disclosed therein.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022]<br>
In consideration of the above circumstances of the prior art, the problem of the<br>
present invention is to provide a novel carbapenem compound which is a production<br>
intermediate of 2-(substituted mercapto)-1β-methyl-carbapenem antibiotics and which is<br>
easily handable, cheap, has high reactivity of the phosphoric acid ester part, and can<br>
easily remove the phosphoric acid ester part.<br>
[0023]<br>
The present inventors have extensively studied about useful intermediates of 2-<br>
(substituted mercapto)-1β-methyl-carbapenem antibiotics in order to solve the above<br>
problem, and found that the compound represented by formula (Ia) shown below<br><br>
specifically crystallizes, that, by the reacted substrate, the reactivity of the phosphoric<br>
acid ester part of the compound represented by formula (Ia) is high and thus the<br>
phosphoric acid ester can be easily removed, and that, by the reacted substrate, the<br>
carboxyl group protective group of the compound represented by formula (Ia) can be<br>
easily removed, thus leading to completion of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, a carbapenem compound represented by<br>
formula (Ia) shown below:<br><br>
is provided.<br>
It is preferable that the carbapenem compound of the present invention has a<br>
crystalline form and it is more preferable that the crystalline form has a powder X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern with peaks at 15.64, 9.93, 6.83, 6.52, 5.44, 5.01, 4.72,4.50,4.33,4.24,<br>
3.98, 3.85, 3.57, 3.41, 3.31, 3.10 2.76, and 2.67 as d-spacings (A).<br>
[0026]<br>
The compound of the present invention is similarly stable to the compound (Ib),<br>
which is a crystalline form bulk raw material that has heretofore been known as a<br>
production intermediate having a carbapenem skeleton.<br>
Also, compared to the compound (Ib), the compound of the present invention,<br>
by the reacted substrate, has high reactivity of the phosphoric acid ester part and is a<br><br>
compound having an allyl group, which is comparatively cheap and easily removable, as<br>
a carboxyl group protective group.<br>
The present invention is thus a further superior production intermediate of<br>
antibiotics having a carbapenem skeleton.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0027]<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
The present invention is the carbapenem compound represented by formula (Ia)<br>
shown above (compound name: allyl-(lR,5R,6S)-2-[bis(2,2,2-<br>
trichloroethyl)phosphoryloxy]-6-[(R)-l-hydroxyethyl]-l-methyl-carbapenem-3-<br>
carboxylate, hereinafter referred to as "compound of the present invention" or<br>
"compound (Ia)").<br>
This compound is a novel substance.<br>
[0028]<br>
The carbapenem compound of the present invention preferably has a crystalline<br>
form, and more preferably, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern has characteristic peaks<br>
at 15.64, 9.93, 6.83, 6.52, 5.44, 5.01, 4.72,4.50, 4.33, 4.24, 3.98, 3.85, 3.57, 3.41, 3.31,<br>
3.10 2.76, and 2.67 as d-spacings (A).<br>
[0029]<br>
The compound of the present invention can be prepared similarly to a method<br>
for preparing a well-known compound having a skeleton similar to that of the compound<br>
of the present invention.<br>
For example, as disclosed in formula shown below, the compound of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by reacting the compound represented by formula (Ha)<br>
(compound name: allyl-(lR,5R,6S)-[(R)-l-hydroxyethyl]-2-oxo-carbapenem-3-<br><br>
carboxylate, hereinafter referred to as a "compound (IIa)") with a bis(2,2,2-<br>
trichloroethyl)phosphoryl halide represented by formula (IV) (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl halide (IV)" in a suitable organic solvent in the<br>
presence of a base.<br><br>
As the bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl halide (IV) used here, bis(2,2,2-<br>
trichloroethyl)phosphoryl chloride and bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl bromide can<br>
be given as examples.<br>
The amount of the bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) phosphoryl halide (IV) used is<br>
normally 1 to 5 times the number of moles of the compound represented by formula (IIa).<br>
[0032]<br>
As used bases, metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium<br>
hydroxide; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, magnesium<br>
ethoxide, and potassium t-butoxide; metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, potassium<br><br>
hydride, and calcium hydride; tertiary amines such as diisopropylethylamine and<br>
triethylamine; aromatic amines such as pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, picoline, and<br>
lutidine; and aliphatic cyclic amines such as l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)<br>
and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.0]octane (Dabco) can be given as examples.<br>
These bases may be used alone, or two or more thereof may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
The amount of the base used is normally 1 to 5 times the number of moles of the<br>
bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl halide (IV).<br>
[0033]<br>
As the used organic solvent, there are no particular limitations as long as the<br>
organic solvent is inactive to the reaction. Halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
methylene chloride and chloroform; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide; ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,2-dimethoxyethane;<br>
esters such as ethyl acetate and propyl acetate; and nitriles such as acetonitrile can be<br>
given as examples.<br>
The amount of the organic solvent used is normally 0.1 to 100 g based on 1 g of<br>
the compound represented by formula (Ha).<br>
[0034]<br>
The reaction smoothly progresses in a temperature range from -50°C to the<br>
boiling point of the solvent used, and preferably in a temperature range from -20°C to<br>
+40°C.<br>
The reaction time, which is dependent on the reaction scale, is usually from<br>
several minutes to several-tens hours.<br>
[0035]<br>
After the reaction has been completed, normal aftertreatment operations and the<br>
like in organic synthetic chemistry are carried out. According to necessity, the target<br><br>
compound (Ia) can be isolated by carrying out separation and purification operations.<br>
The structure of the target compound can be confirmed by a well-known<br>
analytical means such as IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the compound (Ia) is obtained in a<br>
crystalline form. In order to obtain the compound (Ia) in a crystalline form, a method<br>
shown by (i) or (ii) shown below, for example, can be used.<br>
[0037]<br>
(i) A method in which the reaction mixture obtained by the carrying out of<br>
normal aftertreatment operations in organic synthetic chemistry on the above reaction<br>
solution is separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography, the fraction<br>
including the target product is concentrated, the concentrated product is dissolved in<br>
ethyl acetate, n-hexane is added thereto, and then cooled.<br>
(ii) A method in which the organic layer is separated by adding water to the<br>
reaction solution, the separated organic layer is concentrated after drying the same over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate, a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and n-hexane is added<br>
thereto, and then the entirety is cooled.<br>
[0038]<br>
The compound (IIa), which is a starting material, is a well-known compound<br>
and can be obtained by a well-known preparation method. For example, the compound<br>
(IIa) can be prepared by subjecting the compound represented by the below-mentioned<br>
formula (Va) (hereinafter referred to as a "compound (Va)") to ring closure in the<br>
presence of rhodium octanoate.<br>
[0039]<br>
Also, in this situation, the target compound (Ia) can be obtained by, after<br>
carrying out the ring-closing reaction of the compound (Va), reacting the obtained<br><br>
reaction solution by adding a base and a bis(trichloroethyl)phosphoryl halide (IV).<br>
When this method is used, crystals of the compound represented by formula (Ia)<br>
can be isolated by the method disclosed in (i) or (ii) shown above.<br><br>
Although it is preferable to separate and use the compound of the present<br>
invention as crystals as disclosed above, the compound of the present invention can be<br>
used in a next step as is.<br>
[0042]<br>
As is clear from the after-mentioned examples, the compound represented by<br>
formula (Ia) obtained in a crystalline form as disclosed above has a powder X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern with peaks at 15.64, 9.93, 6.83, 6.52, 5.44, 5.01, 4.72, 4.50, 4.33, 4.24,<br>
3.98, 3.85, 3.57, 3.41, 3.31,3.10 2.76, and 2.67 as d-spacings (A) and is very stable in<br>
this crystalline form.<br><br>
[0043]<br>
The compound of the present invention is similarly stable to a crystalline form<br>
bulk raw material which has heretofore been known as a production intermediate having<br>
a carbapenem skeleton (compound (Ib)). Compared to the compound (Ib), the<br>
compound of the present invention, by the reacted substrate, has high reactivity of the<br>
phosphoric acid ester part and is a compound having an allyl group, which is<br>
comparatively cheap and easily removable, as a carboxyl group protective group.<br>
Compared to the compound (Ib), the present invention is thus a further superior<br>
production intermediate of antibiotics having a carbapenem skeleton.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0044]<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail by way of examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
3.11 g of the compound (Va) was dissolved in 20 ml of ethyl acetate and 40.3<br>
mg of rhodium octanoate dimer was added thereto at 40°C. This solution was heated to<br>
from 50°C to 54°C and after stirring for 40 minutes at this temperature, 4.07 g of,<br>
bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl chloride and 13.7 mg of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine<br>
were added under ice cooling. 1.45 g of diisopropylethylamine was added by dropping<br>
over 15 minutes at from -5°C to 0°C and after the completion of dropwise addition, the<br>
reaction solution was stirred for 30 minutes at from -5°C to -3°C.<br>
[0045]<br>
The reaction solution was washed twice with 10 ml of water and once with 10<br>
ml of a 10% brine, and after drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, was concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure. The obtained brown oily residue was dissolved in 15 ml of<br>
ethyl acetate and 40 ml of n-hexane was added thereto by dropping at room temperature.<br><br>
The light brown powdery solid which precipitated after stirring the mixture for 1 hour at<br>
0°C was filtered and about 6.0 g of crude crystals was obtained by vacuum drying the<br>
filtered brown powdery solid.<br>
[0046]<br>
After the obtained crude crystals were dissolved in 25 ml of ethyl acetate by<br>
heating, 25 ml of n-hexane was added thereto by dropping and white powdery crystals<br>
precipitated after stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. This white powder was<br>
filtered, and 2.81 g (45%) of needle crystals of the compound (Ia) was obtained by<br>
carrying out recrystallization again of the filtered white powder from 25 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate and 25 ml of n-hexane. The boiling point was 121 to 123°C.<br>

[0049]<br>
Measurement of Powder X-ray Diffraction of Compound (Ia)<br>
Measurement of the powder X-ray diffraction of the compound (Ia) as obtained<br>
above was carried out. The measurement was carried out using an X-ray diffractomter<br>
(X'Pert PRO manufactured by Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.) The measurement<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0050]<br><br><br>
[0051]<br>
Stability Test of Compound (Ia) in Crystalline State<br>
About 2 g of the compound (Ia) in a crystalline form which was obtained in the<br>
same way as Example 1 was placed in sample bottles, and the sample bottles were stored<br>
at room temperature (about 20°C) and in a room maintained at a temperature of about<br>
40°C. Taking the original purity as 100%, after every several number of days, the<br>
purity of the compound (Ia) was measured using high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC measurement conditions are shown below. Also,<br>
the measurement results are shown in Table 2<br>
[0052]<br>
Measurement Conditions<br>
Solvent delivery system: LC-10A (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation)<br>
UV, VIS detector: SPD-10A (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation)<br>
Detection wavelength: 215 nm<br>
Column heater: Sugai U-620 (used at 40°C, Sugai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.)<br>
Column: Inertsil ODS-2 (4.6 mm diameter X 250 mm length, GL Sciences, Inc.)<br><br><br>
[0054]<br>
As shown in Table 2, from measuring the purity at 20°C and 40°C after 6 days,<br>
after 17 days, after 21 days, and after 31 days, the compound (Ia) in the crystalline form<br>
was very stable without a decrease in purity.<br>
Reference Example<br><br>
3.12 g of the compound (Va) was dissolved in 20 ml of ethyl acetate and 40.3<br>
mg of rhodium octanoate dimer was added thereto at room temperature. This solution<br><br>
was heated to from 50°C to 53°C and after stirring for 45 minutes at this temperature,<br>
3.00 g of diphenylphosphoryl chloride and 13.5 mg of N,N-(dimethyl)aminopyridine<br>
were added at -3°C. 1.43 g of diisopropylethylamine was added thereto by dropping<br>
over 5 minutes at from -3°C to -2°C. After the reaction solution was stirred for 30<br>
minutes at from -5°C to -3°C, the reaction solution was washed twice with 10 ml of<br>
water and once with 10 ml of a 10% brine solution, and after drying over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate, was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained brown oily<br>
residue was dissolved in 10 ml of ethyl acetate and 15 ml of n-hexane was added thereto<br>
by dropping at room temperature. Although the mixture was stirred for 3 hours at from<br>
-5°C to 0°C, crystals of the compound (Ic) were not obtained.<br>
