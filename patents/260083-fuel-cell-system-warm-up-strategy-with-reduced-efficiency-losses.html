FUEL CELL SYSTEM WARM-UP STRATEGY WITH REDUCED EFFICIENCY<br>
LOSSES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to a method for quickly and<br>
efficiently heating a fuel cell stack at system start-up and, more particularly, to a<br>
method for heating a fuel cell stack at system start-up that prioritizes and uses heat<br>
sources based on their efficiency.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can be<br>
used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an electro-<br>
chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte<br>
therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives oxygen<br>
or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free protons and<br>
electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. The protons<br>
react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate water. The<br>
electrons from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed<br>
through a load to perform work before being sent to the cathode.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a popular<br>
fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer electrolyte<br>
proton conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane. The<br>
anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic particles, usually platinum<br>
(Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an ionomer. The catalytic mixture<br>
is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane. The combination of the anode<br>
catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and the membrane define a<br>
membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack to<br>
generate the desired power. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode reactant gas,<br>
typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Not all of the oxygen<br>
is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas<br>
that may include water as a stack by-product. The fuel cell stack also receives an<br><br>
anode hydrogen reactant gas that flows into the anode side of the stack. The stack<br>
also includes flowchannels through which a cooling fluid flows.<br>
[0005]	A fuel cell stack typically includes a series of bipolar plates<br>
positioned between the several MEAs in the stack, where the bipolar plates and the<br>
MEAs are positioned between two end plates. The bipolar plates include an anode<br>
side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the stack. Anode gas flow channels<br>
are provided on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the anode reactant<br>
gas to flow to the respective MEA. Cathode gas flow channels are provided on the<br>
cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode reactant gas to flow to the<br>
respective MEA. One end plate includes anode gas flow channels, and the other<br>
end plate includes cathode gas flow channels. The bipolar plates and end plates are<br>
made of a conductive material, such as stainless steel or a conductive composite.<br>
The end plates conduct the electricity generated by the fuel cells out of the stack.<br>
The bipolar plates also include flow channels through which a cooling fluid flows.<br>
[0006]	A fuel cell stack operates more efficiently and more stably at a<br>
certain stack operating temperature that is typically controlled by a cooling fluid<br>
flowing through the stack. At system start-up, the fuel cell stack will typically be at a<br>
low temperature, possibly below freezing. It is desirable to heat the stack as quickly<br>
as possible to the desired temperature at system start-up so that the stack will<br>
operate more efficiently and more stably sooner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a<br>
method is disclosed for quickly and efficiently heating a fuel cell stack at system<br>
start-up. The method uses and prioritizes various stack heat sources based on their<br>
efficiency to heat the stack. A thermal power set-point for heating the stack to the<br>
desired temperature is determined based on the ambient temperature and the stack<br>
cooling fluid temperature. The set-point is then compared to the stack heating<br>
provided by the heat sources that are operating through normal system start-up<br>
operation. If more heat is necessary to reach the set-point, the method may first<br>
charge a system battery using stack power where the load causes the fuel cell stack<br>
to heat up. If additional heating is still required, the method may then turn on a<br><br>
cooling fluid heater, then flow a small amount of hydrogen into the cathode inlet<br>
stream to provide combustion, and then increase the compressor load as needed.<br>
[0008]	Additional features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following description and appended claims taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009]	Figure 1 is a block diagram of a fuel cell system; and<br>
[0010]	Figure 2 is a block diagram of a controller showing a process for<br>
quickly and efficiently heating a fuel cell stack at system start-up, according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011]	The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention<br>
directed to a method for prioritizing and using various heat sources for heating a fuel<br>
cell stack at system start-up based on their efficiency is merely exemplary in nature,<br>
and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses.<br>
[0012]	As will be discussed in detail below, the present invention<br>
proposes a method for heating a fuel cell stack at system start-up as quickly and<br>
efficiently as possible that minimizes stack warm-up time. The method employs<br>
several different heat sources to be used to heat the stack at system start-up.<br>
Those heat sources include heat generated by stack inefficiencies based on stack<br>
load, a cooling fluid heater, end-cell heaters in the stack, flowing hydrogen into the<br>
cathode side of the stack to create catalytic combustion and over-loading the<br>
cathode compressor to generate heat in the cathode air cell. Stack heat generation<br>
can be increased by charging a high voltage battery, which acts as a stack load.<br>
Because the energy used to charge the battery is recoverable from the battery, this<br>
technique of heating the stack is the most efficient. Using the cooling fluid heater<br>
and the stack end-cell heater not only heat the cooling fluid and the stack end cells,<br>
but also increases stack load current, which also operates to heat the stack.<br>
Because of this double heating effect, the cooling fluid heaters and the end cell<br>
heaters are the second most efficient way of heating the fuel cell stack. The next<br><br>
most efficient way of heating the fuel cell stack is to inject a small amount of<br>
hydrogen into the cathode side of the stack where it will combust, generating heat.<br>
There are component limitations on how much hydrogen can be injected into the<br>
cathode side of the stack. Also, some of the injected hydrogen may flow to the<br>
exhaust causing undesirable emission spikes in the system. The last technique for<br>
generating extra heat for heating the stack is by increasing the pressure ratio across<br>
the compressor to heat the cathode inlet air and increase the electric load on the<br>
stack. This method is typically inefficient and creates extra noise in the system.<br>
[0013]	Figure 1 is a plan view of a fuel cell system 10 including a fuel<br>
cell stack 12. The fuel cell stack 12 includes end cell heaters 14 and 16 provided in<br>
the end cells of the stack 12. The fuel cell stack 12 receives cathode input air from a<br>
compressor 18 on cathode input line 20, and outputs cathode exhaust gas on<br>
cathode output line 22. Likewise, the fuel cell stack 12 receives hydrogen gas on<br>
anode input line 24 from a hydrogen storage source 28, and outputs anode exhaust<br>
gas on anode output line 26. Hydrogen gas from the source 28 can be selectively<br>
provided to the cathode input line 20 and into the cathode side of the stack 12<br>
through a valve 44 to provide combustion on the cathode side of the stack 12 to heat<br>
the stack 12 in a manner that is well understood to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0014]	Cooling fluid flow channels are provided in the bipolar plates in<br>
the fuel cell stack 12. A cooling fluid is pumped through the cooling fluid flow<br>
channels by a pump 30 and through a cooling fluid loop 32 outside of the stack 12.<br>
The cooling fluid in the loop 32 from the stack 12 is sent to a radiator 34 where it is<br>
reduced in temperature prior to being sent back to the fuel cell stack 12. A by-pass<br>
valve 36 in the loop 32 can be controlled to allow a selective amount of the cooling<br>
fluid to by-pass the radiator 34 on a by-pass line 38 so that the cooling fluid is not<br>
cooled by the radiator 34. A cooling fluid heater 40 in the cooling fluid loop 32 can<br>
be used to heat the cooling fluid at stack start-up. A temperature sensor 42<br>
measures the temperature of the cooling fluid in the loop 32 coming out of the stack<br>
12.<br>
[0015]	The system 10 also includes a high voltage battery 46 that is<br>
electrically coupled to the fuel cell stack 12, and can be charged by the stack 12.<br><br>
[0016]	According to the invention, a stack warm-up algorithm heats the<br>
stack 12 at system start-up so that the stack 12 reaches its desirable operating<br>
temperature more quickly and in an efficient manner. The algorithm first determines<br>
how much heat is being generated by the various heat sources that heat the stack<br>
12 from the normal operation of the system 10. For example, if large loads are<br>
placed on the stack 12 immediately at system start-up, then the heat generated by<br>
the stack 12 itself should be sufficient to heat the stack 12 to its operating<br>
temperature quickly. If enough heat is not being generated from normal system<br>
operation because the stack 12 is too cold or the heat sources are not sufficient, the<br>
algorithm activates and prioritizes the various heat sources based on efficiency and<br>
amount of heat desired. This prioritizing includes first drawing current from the stack<br>
12 to charge the battery 46. If the stack 12 cannot generate enough heat by<br>
charging the battery 46 to heat the stack 12 quickly enough, then the algorithm will<br>
turn on the cooling fluid heater 40. If more heat is still needed, then the algorithm<br>
will feed hydrogen into the cathode side of the stack 12 through the valve 44 to<br>
create combustion. If more heat is still needed, then the pressure ratio across the<br>
compressor 18 can be increased by, for example, closing a valve in the line 20 that<br>
causes the compressor 18 to work harder.<br>
[0017]	According to the invention, the set-point for the warm-up<br>
algorithm is based on the cooling fluid outlet temperature from the temperature<br>
sensor 42 and the ambient temperature, which are used to identify a thermal power<br>
in kilowatts that identifies how much heat is to be provided. Based on equation (1)<br>
below, the gross heat generation Qgrass is calculated by adding stack heat<br>
generation Qstack, cooling fluid heater heat generation Qcoolant heater end cell heater<br>
heat generation .Qend cell heater heat generated by the cathode hydrogen flow<br>
QHz and compressor heat generation Qcompressor.<br><br>
[0018]	Stack heat generation can be calculated as:<br><br><br>
[0019]	Compressor heat into the cooling fluid may be neglected<br>
because it is generally small in magnitude relative to the other heat sources and<br>
difficult to measure accurately. The effect of extra compressor power on stack load<br>
and stack generated heat is accounted for in equation (2).<br><br>
Where the lower heating value for hydrogen is 120 kW/(g/sec) and rslip is a function<br>
of cooling fluid outlet temperature and average cell voltage.<br>
[0020]	Figure 2 is a block diagram 50 showing a process for<br>
determining the heat required for heating the stack 12 to the desired temperature<br>
within a short period of time at system start-up, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A heat generation request signal is provided on line 52 from a<br>
look-up table 54 depending on the ambient temperature from an ambient<br>
temperature sensor 56 and the cooling fluid temperature on line 58 from the<br>
temperature sensor 42. The heat generation request signal is sent to a summation<br>
block 60 that determines a heat generation error on line 62 as the difference<br>
between the heat that is currently being provided to the stack 12 by normal system<br>
heat sources and the desired heating of the stack 12. The error is provided to a<br>
proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller 64 that generates a heat delta<br>
request that the warm-up algorithm will then use to prioritize additional heating of the<br>
stack 12 based on the discussion above.<br>
[0021]	If the system 10 is started, and the vehicle operator immediately<br>
operates the vehicle, the load on the stack 12 will provide stack heat generation on<br>
line 66 based on equation (2). This stack heat generation may be sufficient to meet<br>
the demands of heating the stack 12 quickly and efficiently. The stack 12 may be<br>
providing power to operate the compressor 18, the cooling fluid pump 30, etc., which<br>
also adds to the amount of heat provided on the line 66 based on equation (2). The<br>
end cell heaters 14 and 16 may be on as controlled by an end cell heating algorithm,<br><br>
