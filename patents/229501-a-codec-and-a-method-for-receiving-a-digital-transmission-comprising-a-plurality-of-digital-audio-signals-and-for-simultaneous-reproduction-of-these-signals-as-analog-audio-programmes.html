				<td>A CODEC AND A METHOD FOR RECEIVING A DIGITAL<br>
TRANSMISSION COMPRISING A PLURALITY OF DIGITAL<br>
AUDIO SIGNALS AND FOR SIMULTANEOUS REPRODUCTION<br>
OF THESE SIGNALS AS ANALOG AUDIO PROGRAMMES<br>
Background<br>
This invention relates to a codec and a method for receiving a digital<br>
transmission comprising a plurality of digital audio signals and for<br>
simultaneous reproduction of these signals as analog audio programmes, and<br>
relates generally to audio codec for processor-based systems.<br>
An audio codec receives digital audio information,<br>
converts it to an analog format and mixes that audio<br>
information with other data for play by a processor-based<br>
system. Generally, the codec is controlled by an audio<br>
controller, also known as an audio accelerator, coupled to a<br>
bus. The audio accelerator is in turn controlled by the<br>
processor.<br>
Many processor-based systems are now being used for<br>
relatively elaborate audio functions. For example,<br>
processor-based systems may be used to receive digital<br>
radio, television and stereo system signals and to play<br>
those signals in a unified system. Digital television<br>
signals may be received through a cable or satellite<br>
connection. In addition, processor-based systems may be<br>
utilized to record digital audio information received from a<br>
variety of sources.<br>
Conventional codecs, however, handle one audio program<br>
at any one time. For example, the Audio Codec '97 (AC' 97)<br>
Specification, Revision 2.1, dated May 22, 1998, available<br>
from Intel Corporation, describes an audio codec that<br>
receives a digital stereo channel pair and converts that<br>
pair into an analog stereo channel pair. The term "pair"<br>
refers to the two channels conventionally called the left<br>
and the right channels in stereo systems. The converted<br>
analog stereo channel pair may be mixed with other<br>
information in a mixer within the codec. The mixer is also<br><br>
coupled to an analog to digital converter that provides an output from the<br>
mixer to the digital link.<br>
The AC 97 codec is amenable to handling only one audio program at a<br>
time. It is not amenable, for example, to simultaneously recording and playing<br>
a television program.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a codec that supports the increasing<br>
demands being placed on processor-based systems for handling more than<br>
one audio program at a time.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a codec comprising : a<br>
digital interface a plurality of stereo channel pairs; a first pair of digital to<br>
analog converters coupled to one of said stereo channel pairs ; a second pair<br>
of digital to analog converters coupled to another one of said stereo channel<br>
pairs ; a pair of analog mixers each outputting a separate audio program,<br>
each of said mixers coupled to one of said first and second pairs of digital to<br>
analog converters ; and a pair of analog to digital converters coupled to<br>
another one of said stereo channel pairs ; one of said mixers also coupled to<br>
said pair of analog to digital converters.<br>
The present invention also provides a processor-based system<br>
comprising : a processor; an audio accelerator coupled to said processor; a<br>
codec coupled to said audio accelerator, said codec comprising a digital<br>
interface having a plurality of stereo channel pairs, a first pair of digital analog<br>
converters coupled to one of said stereo channel pairs, a second pair of<br>
digital-to-analog converters coupled to another one of said stereo channel<br>
pairs, and a pair of analog mixers each outputting a separate audio program,<br>
each of said mixers coupled to one of said first and second pairs of digital-to-<br>
analog converters.<br><br>
The present invention further provides a method for receiving a digital<br>
transmission comprising a plurality of digital audio signals and for<br>
simultaneous reproduction of these signals as analog audio programmes<br>
comprising the steps of : receiving at least two digital audio programs in a<br>
codec ; converting each of said digital audio programs to an analog format<br>
and mixing each digital program ; and providing an analog output for each<br>
audio program.<br>
The present invention further provides an article comprising a<br>
medium storing instructions that enable a processor-based system to :<br>
receive at least two digital audio programs ; convert each of said digital audio<br>
programs to an analog format ; output each of said audio programs to a<br>
different port; and programmably change the assignment of said programs to<br>
said ports.<br>
The present invention further provides an article comprising a<br>
medium storing instructions that enable a processor-based system to :<br>
receive at least two digital audio programs ; convert each of said digital audio<br>
programs to an analog format; programmably change the data rate of at least<br>
one of said audio programs.<br>

embodiment of the present invention; and<br>

Detailed Description<br>
A processor-based system 10, shown in Figure 1, may be a conventional<br>
desktop, laptop or handheld computer system or a processor-based web appliance<br>
device. In one embodiment of the present invention, the system 10 may be a set-top<br>
box in which the display 36 is a television receiver.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the system 10<br>
may handle more than one audio program at a time. An audio program is a stereo or<br>
monaural file that is received over a digital link. The audio program may include<br>
voice, music, or television sound, as examples. In some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the<br><br>
system 10 may play one audio program at the same time it is<br>
recording another audio program.<br>
The system 10 includes a processor 12 coupled to a<br>
north bridge 16. The north bridge 16 couples the system<br>
memory 20 and a video and graphics bus 23. The north bridge<br>
16 may include a graphics controller and a memory<br>
controller. The bus 22 may be coupled to a decoder 34 that<br>
is coupled to the display 36, such as a television receiver<br>
or monitor. The decoder 34 may be coupled to a<br>
demodulator/tuner 37. The decoder 34 may also include video<br>
digital to analog converters and a demultiplexer. The<br>
decoder 34 may, for example, decode data compressed<br>
according to one of the standards promulgated by the Motion<br>
Picture Experts Group, such as for International<br>
Organization for Standarisation {Geneva, Switzerland)<br>
ISO/TEC 11172 (1993).<br>
One compressed television program may be decoded by the<br>
decoder 34 so that uncompressed video data is sent to the<br>
south bridge 38 over the bus 22. At the same time another<br>
program may be processed by the processor 12 and north<br>
bridge 16.<br>
The south bridge 38 forwards the audio data to the<br>
coder/decoder or codec 26 through a digital link 54. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
digital link 54 and the codec 2 6 may be compliant with the<br>
AC 97 specification. The codec 26 receives a digital signal<br>
over the digital link 54 and provides an analog output to a<br>
sound system 30 that includes an amplifier and speakers.<br>
The speakers may be a part of a television receiver 36 or<br>
other entertainment device.<br>
The south bridge 38 also couples a compact disk player<br>
44 and a hard disk drive 42. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the hard disk drive 42 may be utilized to<br><br>
record an audio program. For example, the system 10 may<br>
record an audio program on the hard disk drive 42 at the<br>
same time the system 10 is playing an audio program received<br>
from the compact disk player 44.<br>
Thus, in some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
digital audio programs may be received through the<br>
demodulator/tuner 37 which may be coupled, for example to a<br>
satellite or cable connection. The received data is<br>
forwarded to the decoder 34, which separates video, audio<br>
and other data streams and sends audio data to the north<br>
bridge 16. One of those audio programs may be recorded, for<br>
example on the hard disk drive 42 at the same time another<br>
audio program is being played over the sound system 30. In<br>
some embodiments of the present invention, a third audio<br>
program may be handled by the codec 2 6 at the same time as<br>
the other two audio programs.<br>
The south bridge 38 may also couple a firmware hub 52<br>
used for booting the system 10. In one embodiment, the hub<br>
52 may be a nonvolatile memory, such as a flash memory, that<br>
also stores information such as channel number, volume<br>
settings and the like when the system 10 is powered down.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the codec 2 6 receives at least<br>
two digital audio programs over the digital link 54. The<br>
codec 26 includes a digital interface 56. The digital<br>
interface 56 provides a plurality of monaural channels and<br>
stereo channel pairs. For example, the digital interface 56<br>
may provide a channel pair to a pair of digital to analog<br>
converters 58. Each of the pair of converters 58 may<br>
convert one of a left and right stereg channel, in a digital<br>
format, to an analog format. A power management module 78<br>
provides power management for the codec 26.<br>
Similarly, the digital interface 56 may include a pair<br>
of channels that receive an analog input from an analog to<br><br>
digital converter pair 60. Moreover, the digital interface<br>
56 may provide another channel pair to another pair of<br>
digital to analog converters 80. Each of the digital to<br>
analog converter pairs 58 and 80 are coupled to a different<br>
analog mixer 62 or 82. The mixers 62 atnd 82 mix the<br>
information from the digital to analog converters 58 and 80,<br>
respectively, with other information that may be received by<br>
the codec 26. In addition, the mixers 62 and 82 may provide<br>
audio gain control. A line output 84 is provided for the<br>
mixer 82.<br>
Also coupled to the digital interface 56 is a<br>
Sony/Phillips digital interconnect format (S/PDIF) formatter<br>
86. The S/PDIF is described in the ISC 60958 (1989)<br>
Standard titled, "Digital Audio Interface" (IEC 60958<br>
(1989)) by the International Electrotechnical Commission and<br>
available from American National Standards Institute, New<br>
York, New York 10036. The formatter 86 may receive an<br>
S/PDIF audio program from the digital interface 56 and may<br>
provide the program, in appropriate format, to a pair of<br>
left and right channels 8 8 and 90.<br>
The S/PDIF format carries a stereo channel pair with a<br>
sampling rate of up to 45 kilosampl.es per second and a<br>
sample precision of up to 24 bits. An S/PDIF physical link<br>
uses a biphase Manchester coded stream. Manchester coding<br>
combines a data stream, with a clock on a single channel,<br>
with up to two transitions on the line for each bit<br>
conveyed. There is a line transition at each end of a bit<br>
and a central transition if the data is a one. The S/PDIF<br>
also carries a subcode that indicates the current track<br>
number and current time within the track.<br>
In some cases, the digital link 54 may provide data<br>
faster than the formatter 8 6 can handle that data. If there<br>
is any mismatching between the data sending rate from the<br><br>
data consuming rate, a software driver may be used to apply<br>
stuffing data to a pair of slots in the digital interface<br>
56. One of those slots may include a control word that<br>
tells whether the data in the two slots are real data or<br>
stuffing data. The formatter 86 may also include a phase<br>
locked loop circuit for generating signals of the desired<br>
frequencies.<br>
The formatter 8 6 in some embodiments of the present<br>
invention may output the same audio program as the digital<br>
to analog converter 80. Alternatively, the formatter 8 6 may<br>
handle a third audio program.<br>
Audio programs may be swapped, on the fly, between the<br>
digital to analog converter pair 80 and the digital to<br>
analog converter pair 58 by software. Thus, a first channel<br>
may be recorded while watching a second channel. One can<br>
easily switch to recording the second channel while watching<br>
the first channel, without reconnecting cables to external<br>
recording peripherals.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the digital<br>
link 54 provides stereo pulse code modulated (PCM) signals.<br>
The digital to analog converters 58 and 80 may operate at 48<br>
kilohertz.<br>
The mixer 62 may receive signals from the digital to<br>
analog converter pair 58 as well as from two pairs of stereo<br>
channels 70 and 72 and a pair of monaural channels 74 and<br>
76. The various input channels may be mixed and gain<br>
control may be provided. The mixer 62 may output a pair of<br>
left and right line out channels 64 and 66 and a monaural<br>
output 68. Thus, an output signal may be provided to an<br>
output jack for a stereo mix of all sources and a headphone<br>
jack, as one example. The line input channels 70, 72, 74<br>
and 76 then receive a variety of analog inputs from external<br>
sources. The monaural output 68 may, for example, be<br><br>
utilized by a telephone system. One of the line inputs 70<br>
or 72 may also include a signal from the compact disk player<br>
44.<br>
The software 92 for controlling the codec 26, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown in Figure 3. The software 92 may be stored on the<br>
hard disk drive 42 in one embodiment.<br>
Initially, the software 92 checks, at diamond 94, to<br>
determine whether a request has been received to switch the<br>
output or input ports of the codec 26. For example, if the<br>
user is recording a first audio program on the line out 64<br>
and playing a second audio program through the line out 84<br>
to the display 36, the user may thereafter wish to play the<br>
program on the line out 64 on the television and record the<br>
program on the line out 84. To do this without having to<br>
reconnect the peripheral devices to the different line outs,<br>
the user may provide an input to the processor-based system<br>
10 through a graphical user interface. The user may request<br>
a switch of the information fed to the various outputs. For<br>
example, the processor 12 may control the digital interface<br>
56 and its multiplexer to change the data that is fed to the<br>
various output ports of the digital interface 56.<br>
Thus, as indicated in Figure 3, when a switch request<br>
is received, as determined in diamond 94, it may cause a<br>
signal to be sent to the digital interface 56 to change the<br>
multiplexer output ports as indicated in block 96.<br>
If no switch request is received or after implementing<br>
a switch request, a check at block 98 determines whether the<br>
data rates of the various components connected to the codec<br>
26 are compatible with the codec's data, rates. If a<br>
peripheral device such as one connected to the S/PDIF<br>
formatter 86 output lines 88 and 90 is unable to utilize the<br>
data rate provided by the codec 26, as determined in diamond<br><br>
100, the processor 12 may modify the data rates as indicated<br>
in block 102.<br>
The system 10 may determine that the data rates are<br>
incompatible in a number of different fashions. In one<br>
case, the codec 2 6 may receive a signal from the processor<br>
12 (or the peripheral device) indicating that the data rate<br>
cannot be handled. In another case, the processor 12 may<br>
obtain information such as a device ID from each coupled<br>
peripheral. Based on a database of available data rates for<br>
available components, the processor 12 may determine that<br>
the data rate produced by the codec 26 is incompatible with<br>
a particular peripheral device.<br>
The data rate may be adjusted in a number of ways. In<br>
one case, the data rate maybe adjusted in the digital<br>
interface 56. The processor 12 may generate a signal that<br>
selects a different data rate for a given port in the<br>
digital interface 56. The digital interface 56 may include<br>
a plurality of data rates for each of a plurality of output<br>
ports .<br>
In another case, the processor 12 may cause the audio<br>
accelerator 24 to provide stuffing to effectively decrease<br>
the data rate of data provided to a particular port. In<br>
still another case, the formatter 86 may be commanded by the<br>
processor 12 to slow the data rate, for example by providing<br>
stuffing or other conventional means.<br>
While the present invention has been described with<br>
respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate numerous modifications and<br>
variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended<br>
