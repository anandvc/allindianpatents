SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ACQUIRING A RECEIVED SIGNAL IN A SPREAD SPECTRUM DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[OOOIJ The present invention is directed generally to a wireless spread spectrum device, and, more particularly, to a system and method for acquiring a received sigaal in a wireless spread spectrum device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Spread spectrum modulation, including code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation, is one of several techniques for allowing a large number of system users to share a communication system. Other multiple access techniques include time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (K)MA) systems. There are also analog frequency modulation (FM) based wireless communication systems, such as the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). In addition, many wireless communication devices employ global position system (GPS) techniques. Some wireless communication systems are capable of operating using multiple techniques, such as CDMA and OPS, or on different frequency bands, such as cellular or Personal Communication Services (PCS) bands.<br>
[0003] To simplify the discussion, the background of the invention will focus on CDMA modulation techniques in a wireless communication system. The principles discussed, however, are generally applicable to any spread-spectrum system. CDMA modulation techniques are disclosed in United Stales Patent No. 4,901,30'7, issued on February 13, 1990, entitled "SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS", which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The above-referenced patent discloses the use of a phase-coherent and chip-synchronous chip sequence that is defined as a pilot chip sequence, or pilot signal. The pilot signal can be used to provide phase and time acquisition and tracking, and multi-path correction. [0004] Methods for acquiring signals are disclosed in the above-referenced patent and in the following patents: (I) United States Patent No. 5,781,543, issued on July 14,<br><br>
1998 and entitled "POWER-EFHCIENT ACQUISITION OF A CDMA PILQT SIGNAL"; and (2) United States Patent No. 5,805,648, issued on September S, 1998 and entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING SEARCH ACQUISITION IN A CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM", both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and the disclosures thereof are incoiporaled herein by reference.<br>
[0005] When the wireless device is first powered on, the device must acquire a signal fi:ora a remote location, such as a base station transceiver system (BTS). A wireless CDMA communication device will typically be receiving pilot signals from a plurality of BTSs. The wireless device will search for the signals from the BTSs and will establish a communication link with a selected BTS to permit the reception and transmission of data, such as audio signals, over the established communication link. The selection of a particular BTS and the actual communication between the wireless communication device and the selected BTS are well known in the art and need not be discussed in detail herein.<br>
[0006] As discussed in the above-referenced patents, in a CDMA communications system each BTS broadci^ts the same pseudo-noise (FN) code pilot signal, but with a different phase offset. The pilot signal can be considered as a rotating phasor of the form:<br>
s(t) = Ae^-^'**&gt;-[0007] To acquire the signal, the wireless CDMA device must synchronize with the phase, (f. and frequency, o), of the signal transmitted by a BTS. The object of a "searcher" process in the wireless device is to find the j^ase, ^, of the received signal. The searcher uses an estimated frequency, O). If the estimated frequency is not sufficiently close to the frequency of the pilot, the received signal will not be acquired. [0008] Conventional search modes sequentially conduct a search of all possible FN phase offsets using a set of hypothetical search parameters, l^e search parameters may be varied before the next search sequence, or search sweep. Search parameters may include a search-slice size, or window, a coherent integration length, a non-coherent integration length, a presumed frequency error and Walsh and Quasi-Orthogonal Function (QOF) parameters, and other search parameters. Search parameters are discussed in more detail in the above-referenced United States Patent No. 5,805,648.<br><br>
Conventional search methods are capable of searching for only a single pilot channel during each search sweep. In addition, conventional search methods are capable of using only a single presumed frequency error during each search sweep. 10009] Conventional search methods perform reasonably well with single channel pilot signals broadcast over a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 MHz, or Ix signals. Conventional search methods also perform reasonably well when the frequency error range is low. Recently, several CDMA technologies, such as 3x direct spread (3xDS) signals, 3x multi-carrier (3xMC) signals and orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) signals, have been developed that broadcast the pilot signal over broader fi?equency ranges or in multiple channels. In addition, the frequency error range in the newer CDMA technologies may be higher than in the Ix signals. Conventional search methods fail to take advantage of newer CDMA broadcast technologies. Conventional search methods also have a limited frequei\cy range over which the phase of the pilot signal will be detected.<br>
[0010] Therefore, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for an improved system and method for acquiring a signal in a wireless spread-spectrum device. The present invention provides this and other advantages, as will be apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying figures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In another embodiment, the present invention may be configured to use multiple presumed frequency errors during each search sweep. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention may be configured to search multiple channels using multiple presumed frequency errors during each search sweep.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020] The present invention provides for increased flexibility in conducting a search sweep for a signal in a spread-spectrum wireless device. TTiis allows the user, either manually or automatically, to configure the wireless device to search for the signal based on the operational conditions of the device.<br>
[0021] Although the examples presented herein refer to a CDMA wireless telephone system, and more particularly to a system and method of acquiring a pilot signal in a CDMA wireless telephone system, the principles of the present invention are applicable to any spread-spectrum system.<br>
[0022] The present invention is embodied in a system 100 illustrated in the functional block of FIG. 1. The system 100 includes a central processing unit (CPU) 102, which controls operation of the system. A memory 104, which may include both read-only memory (ROM) and random-access memories (RAM), provides instructions and data to the CPU 102. A portion of the memory 104 may also include non-volatile random-access memory.<br>
[0023] The system 100, which is typically embodied in a wireless communication device, such as a CDMA telephone, also includes a housing 106 that contains a transmitter 108 and a receiver 110 to allow transmission and reception of data, such as audio communication, between the system 100 and a remote location, such as a BTS 200 (see FIG. 2). The transmitter 108 and the receiver 110 may be combined into a transceiver 112. An antenna 114 is attached to the housing 106 and electrically coupled<br><br>
to the transceiver 112. The operation of the transmitter 108, receiver 110, and antenna 114 is well-known in the art and need not be described herein. Although FIG. 1 illustrates the antenna 114 as extending from the housing 106, some designs may include an internal antenna that is contained completely within the housing. The transmitter 108, the receiver 110, and the antenna 114, however, operate in a conventional manner regardless of the location of the antenna.<br>
[0024] A data-input/output system 116 is communicatively linked to the system 100 for operation by the user in a conventional manner. The data-input/output system 116 provides a convenient means by which destination telephone numbers, commands, digital data, voice data and other (kla may be entered. Although FIG. 1 illustrates the data-input/output system 116 as comprising a microphone 118, a keypad 120, a data-iitput/output connector 122, a speaker 124, and a display 126, contained within the housing 106, data may be received and reproduced for the user by other input devices, such as the receiver 110, and the like, alone and in various combinations. [0025] The system 100 also includes a searcher 128, which searches for the phase of a pilot signal received from a BTS, and a search controller 130 to control operation of the seaniher 128. The seaicher 128, in response to control signals from the search controller 130, may be configured to search multiple channels using multiple presumed frequency errors. One skilled in the art will recognize that the searcher 128 may be implemented in a variety of ways, including as a separate comqjonent, such as a digital signal processor (DSP), an application-specific integrated-circuit (ASIC), or the like. [0026] The search controller 130 is shown as a separate block in the functional block diagram of FIG. 1 because it performs specific functions that will be described in detail below. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the search controller 130 may be readily implemented as a series of software inslruclions placed in the memory 104 and executed by the CPU 102. Thus, minor software modifications to existing hardware will allow the implementation of the search controller 130. Alternatively, the search controller 130 may be implemented by a separate processor, such as a DSP, an ASIC, or the like. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the search controller 130 may selectively generate control signals to control the operation of the searcher 128.<br><br>
[0027] The system may also include other types of wireless systems, such as a GPS system 132, which may also employ the searcher 128 and search controller 130 of the present invention.<br>
(00281 Electrical components of the system 100 receive power from a battery 134, which is attached lo and supported by the housing 106. In an exemplary embodiment, the battery 134 is a rechargeable battery. In other embodiments, the system 100 may include a connector (not shown) for the connection of an externa! power source, such as an automobile power adapter, AC power adapter, or the like.<br>
[0029] The various components of the system 100 are coupled together by a bus system 136 which tnay include a power bus, control bus, and status signal bus in addition to a data bus. For the sake of clarity, however, the various buses are illustrated in FIG. 1 as the bus system 136.<br>
[003O] FIG. 2 illustrates the system 100 and a plurality of BTSs 200-206. The system 100 will search for the signals from the BTSs 200-206 over communication links 208-214, respectively, and will establish a communication link with a selected BTS (e.g. BTS 200) to permit the transmission and reception of data, such as audio signals, over the established communication link. Once the signals from the BTS's 200-206 are found, the selection of the BTS and the actual communication between the system lOO and the selected BTS are well known in the art and need not be discussed herein. [0031] As discussed above, the pilot signal can be considered, as a rotating phasor of *e form:<br>
s(t) = Ae'-™**K [0032] FTG. 3 is a representation of the starting time of a pilot signal as conceptual hands 300-302 on a clock. Each BTS broadcasts the same pilot signal but with a different phase, which can be viewed as a different start time or position of a hand 300-302 on a clock. Each hand 300-302 represents a pilot signal broadcast by a different BTS. When viewed in this manner, a Ix signal typically starts at any one of 32,768 chips, which can be viewed as time units on a clock. The goal of a searcher can be viewed as finding the start time, or chip, for the pilot signals broadest by each of several BTSs and selecting a particular BTS with which to establish a communication link. The searcher collects a search slice of data from the signal, or window 304, and compares it to a hypothetical PN data set. As those skilled in the art can annr«-iatft rhp<br><br>
term "window" refers to a selected sample size of chips. A window 304, for example, may gather a small set of, by way of example, 64 chips or a larger set of, by way of example, 256 chips of data. If there is a sufficient correlation between window 304 signal data and the hypothetical PN data set, the phase of a pilot signal is acquired. [0033] FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram of a conventional searcher 400. The conventional searcher 400 searches a single channel for pilot signals broadcast by a plurality of BTSs (See FIG. 2). A rotator 462 compensates for a presumed frequency errorby adjusting thephaseofthe received signal. One skilled in the art will recognize that the rotator 462 may be implemented using a variety of electronic components. For example, a DSP, a complex multiplier, a cordic rotator, or the like may be used to implement the rotator 462. Alternatively, a lookup table in a read-only memory may be employed, because the result of a given phase shift to a given received signal is known. [0034] Output data from the rotator 462 is stored in a search data buffer 470 at the chip rate until a window of d^ is collected. The data is then paired with a data set generated based on a hypothetical PN pilot signal, which is generated by a PN generator 479 and stored in a PN buffer 480. The hypothetical PN pilot signal is based on a set of hypothetical search parameters, as discussed above. The paired data signals are then despread by a despreadei 482 and processed by an adder 484, a coherent accumulator 486, an energy combiner 488, a non-coherent accumulator 490 and a peak sorter/detector 492, as is known in tiie prior art- When a sufficient correlation between the paired sampled signal data and the hypothetical PN pilot signal data exists, peaks will be present at certain chips in the result, indicating acquisition of the phase of a pilot signal. The searcher 400 then determines at which chips peaks were present and the relative strength of any peaks, The detected peaks and their relative strengths are stored on a peak list (not shown), which represents BTSs for which the phase of the pilot signal may have been acquired. The process described above is repeated until the pilot signed from several BTSs have been located and stored in the leak list. The wireless communication device then selects a BTS with which to establish a communication link based, at least in part, on the peak list.<br>
[0035] One of skill in the art will recognize that the conventional searcher 400 may employ a plurality of PN generators and buffers when the operational speed of the searcher is such that multiple search windows can be gathered during each cycle of the<br><br>
pilot signal. For example, some conventional searchere can operate at four times the cycle rate of the pilot signaJ. Thus, the searcher 400 may take advantage of this speed difference by pairing additional window data sets to additional hypothetical data sets ston;d in additional PN buffers. When viewed as a clock (see FIG. 3), the searcher may be able to sample data, foi example, &amp;om 1:00 to 2:00, 4:00 to 5:00, 7:00 to 8:00, and 10:00 to 11:00. Each sample is then compared to a different hypothetical PN data set, stored in a different PN buffer. Thiis, more than one search sweep may be conducted at a time. Alternatively, a single search sweep may be conducted at a higher speed. Each search sweep, however, is limited to one channel and one presumed frequency error. [0036] The present invention improves signal acquisition by increasing the flexibility of the searcher 128. FIG- 5 is a functional block diagram of one embodiment of a system 100 employing a searcher 128 of the present invention to search for the pilot of a 3xMC input signal. The receiver 110 (see FIG. I) receives a signal in which the pilot signal is present. The pilot signal may be either a single-channel or a multi-channel pilot signal. FIG. 5 illustrates reception of a 3KMC input signal. In an exemplary embodiment the signal strength is normalized through the use of an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit 150. The AGC circuit 150, which typic^ly includes one or more variable gain amplifiers and a signal strength (tetection circuit, is well known in the art and need not be described in greater detail herein.<br>
[0037] The received signal is then processed by a filter 152 to separate the signal into its three component channels. The filter 152 may comprise two rotators and three band pass filters. The received signal is run through a band pass filter to eliminate the side channels. This provide a center channel output from the fitter 152. The frequency of the signal from one of the side channels is centered by a rotator, which applies a phase shift to bring that side channel's frequency to the center-chauEw:! frequency. The signal is then passed through a band pass filter. This provides one of the side channel outputs from the filter 1S2. The process is repeated with the other side channel, producing the other side channel output. As discussed above, the rotators in the filter 152 may be implemented in any number of ways, 3&amp; is known in the prior art. [0038] The outputs from the filter 152 are provided to the signal routing circuit 160. The search controller 130 generates coiUrol signals to control the operation of the signal routing circuit 160. Based upon Uie control signals, the signal routing circuit 160 routes<br><br>
thesignals to be searched to one or more of a plurality of rotators 162-168. One skilled in ihe art will recognize that the signal routing circuit 160 may be implemented in a number of ways. For example, the signal routing circuit 160 may consist of a plurality of multiplexer circuits, as shown in FIG. 5. When the received pilot signal is a multi¬channel signal, the signal routing circuit 160 may be configured to route any one of the channels (e.g. any of the three outputs from the filter 152) to any one or more of the plurality of rotators 162-168, based upon control sigrtals received from the search controller 130.<br>
[0039] The search controller 130 also generates control signals to control the phase shift introduced by the rotators 162-168 of the signals to be searched for the pilot signal. Based upon control signals received from the search controller 130, the rotators 162-168 shift the phase of the received signals to compensate for a presumed frequency error, which is an estimate of the difference in frequency between the frequency of the remote device and the signal received ftom one of the BTSs (e.g. the BTS 200). A presumed frequency error may be zero. When multiple rotators 162-168 are employed, each rotator can be independently configured to introduce a different phase shift to compensate for a different presumed frequency error. As discussed above, the rotators 162-168 may be implemented in any number of ways, as is known in the prior art. [0040] When a rotator (e.g. rotator 162) shifts the phase of a signal based upon a presumed frequency error, a "frequency bin" js created. The frequency bin is the ftequency range around the presumed frequency error in which detection of a pilot signal, if present, is likely lo occur. FIG. 6 illustrates Ae use of four frequency bins to search for the pilot signal. FIG. 7 illustrates the use of a single frequency bin to search for the pilot signal with a presumed ftequency error of zero. The maximum frequency error range for which acquisition of the pilot signal is likely to occur is represented by AFnian- Assuming the frequency error range in which acquisition of the pilot signal is likely to occur is the same for each ftequency bin employed, the maximum frequency srtoT range, AFrm, will be approximately four times larger when four frequency bins are employed as shown in FIG. 6 than it is when one fiiequency bin is employed as shown in FIG. 7. Thus, the likelihood of acquiring a pilot signal when the fi-equency error is likely to be hi^ is greMly increased when multiple frequency bins are<br><br>
employed.   This multiple frequency bin configuration is particularly advantageous when the presumed frequency error range is large.<br>
[0041] "Hie output from the rotators 162-168 is stored in a plurality of searcher data buffers 170-176, which may conveniently be implemented as input data shift registers. The data buffers 170-176 store the data contained in the received signals. In one embodiment, the data buffers 170-176 are implemented using a single input data shift register logically divided into a number of fractional slices corresponding to the number of desired buffers. In this embodiment, the search controller 130 may generate control signals to configure the single data shift regjster into ttre appropriate number of fractional slices. In another embodiment, the data buffers 170-176 are implemented using individual data shift register. The implementation of the data buffers 170-176 is a matter of design choice, which may include as a design factor the ability to re-use existing hardware of the system 100 and power consumption considerations. [0042] A pairing logic circuit 178 pairs data in the data buffers 170-176 with data in a plurality of PN buffers 180-186. As discussed in more detail below, the pairing is based on the desired search sweep configuration. The data in the PN buffers 180-186 coirespond to data from hypothetical PN pilot signals, based on a set of search parameters, as discussed above. The search controller 130 may generate control signals to control the pairing logic circuit 178. One skilled in the art will recognize that the pairing lo^c circuit 178 may be implemented in number of ways. For example, the palling logic circuit 178 may consist of a plurality of multiplexer circuits. [0043] The paired data sets are then processed to determine whether the phase of the pilot signal has been acquired, and if so to establish synchronization with a signal from a particular BTS (e.g. the BTS 200). As discussed above, methods for processing of the signals are well known in the prior art and need not be discussed in detail herein. The process, shown in the prior art block diagram of FIG. 4, may be briefly described as combining the energy of each signal pair to detect the presence of peaks at panicular chips. The presence of a peak indicates that the phase of a pilot signal broadcast by a BTS (e.g. BTS 200) has been acquired. The searcher 128 maintains a list of peaks from which it selects a BTS with which the system 100 establishes a communication link. [00441 The si^al routing circuit 160 and the use of multiple rotators 162-168, each allow for greater flexibility than the prior ait in configuring the searcher 128 to conduct<br><br>
a search sweep. When a multi-channel signal is received, the improved searcher 128 can search more than one channel at a time for the signal, In addition, when the frequency error range is likely to be high, the improved searcher 128 can acquire a sipal over a wider frequency range than prior art through the use of multiple frequency bins.<br>
[0045] The number of rotators 162-168, data buffers 170-178, and PN buffers 180-186 in a given embodiment is a matter of design choice. An increase in the quantity of a particular component provides for greater flexibility, but also r^ults in greater costs and power usage. While the system 100 does not require one-to-one correspondence of the particular components, the quantities of each component are related to the modes in which the searcher 128 may be configured to operate, as shown by the examples discussed below. The quantity of each component can also be selected to take advantage of the speed of the system 100. For example, it the speed of the system 100 is such that four windows may be sampled during each cycle of the pilot signal, it may be desirable to have four rotators 162-168, to take advantage of the system speed. Each PN window sample can be independently processed by a corresponding one of the rotators 162-168, to thereby greatly increase the speed of acquisition. [0046] In an exemplary embodiment, the rotators 162-168 and the data buffers 170-178 may be shared with other components of the system 100, such as the GPS system 132, and may be powered down when not in use. Although the GPS system 132 operates independently of the system 100, the GPS system 132 utihzes a large number of rotators. During the initial acquisition of the signal, or whenever the GPS system is not using all of its rotators, the rotators in the GPS system 132 may be allocated for use as the rotators 162-168 in FIG. 5.<br>
[0047] The search controller 130 may be configured to genera control signals to control the operation of the searcher 128 based on a variety of factors, such as received user-input, the type of signal received, instructions received from a remote location, the success rate of prior searches, user and default settings, the quality of the connection with the remote location, the geographical location of the system 100, the presumed frequency error, available power, and the like and various combinations thereof. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the system 100 may be configured to generate<br><br>
control signals by the user, or may be preset to do so at the factory, or some combination thereof.<br>
[0048] In an exemplary embodiment, the various components, such as the rotators 162-168, data buffers 170-176, and PN buffers 180-186, may each be individually enabled by the search controller 130 based on the parameters discussed above. Any components that are not enabled by the search controller 130 may be disabled and may further be powered down to reduce the cuirent drain on the battery 134 (see FIG. 1). [0049] For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the system 100 can be configured for operation with a single pilot channel in what may be referred to as a Mode 1 search. The search controller 130 generates control signals to operate the system 100 in a particular mode designed to take advantage of these conditions. Thus, the search controller 130 may generate control signals to; (1) route the single pilot channel signal to a single rotator 162; (2) enable a single rotator 162; (3) enable a single data buffer 170; and (4) (by taking advantage of the faster speed of the searcher 128) pair the data in data buffer 170 with the hypothetical PN pilot data in each of the PN buffers 180-186.<br>
[0050] The advantage of the system 100 is its versatile dynamically configurable architecture that permits operation of the wireless device in a number of different operational modes. Table 1, below, summarizes various examples modes in which the search controller 130 of the embodiment shown in FIG, 5 may generate control signals to operate the searcher 128. One skilled in the ait will recognize that additional search modes may be employed.<br><br><br><br>
[0051] Modes 1-3 utilize a single channel but with varying numbers of frequency bins based on the presumed frequency error range. Mode 1, which is discussed in the above example, may be implemented when a single channel is to be searched and the frequency error range is presumed to be low. In mode 1, a single channel is searched at high speed with a single frequency bin. The frequency bin, illustrated in FIG, 7, covers<br><br>
the entire range of frequencies, AFma«i over which acquisition of the signal phase, $, will be attempted.<br>
[0052] In Mode 2, a single channel is to be searched, but the frequency error is presumed to be high. Thus, four frequency bins may be employed, each covering a portion of the frequency range to be searched, AFmw. The search speed in mode 2 is lower than in mode 1 }Kx:ause each frequency bin is searched using the same set of remaining search parameters (search parameters other than the presumed frequency error). Thus, when the embodiment shown is FIG. 5 is configured to operate in mode 2, the search controller 130 generates control signals to: (!) route the single pilot channel signal to a each of the rotators 162-168; (2) enable each rotator 162-168 to apply a different phase-adjustment; (3) enable each data buffer 170-176; (4) store data based on the same hypothetical parameter set in each of the PN buffers 180-186; and (5) pair the data in each data buffer 170-176 with the hypothetical PN pilot data in PN buffers 180-186.<br>
[0053] In Mode 3, a single channel is to be searched with a presumed moderate frequency error. Thus, a moderate search speed with 2 frequency bins is used. When the embodiment shown is FIG. 5 is configured to operate in mode 3, the search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) route the single pilot channel signal to two of the rotators 162-164; (2) enable two rotators 162-164; (3) enable two data buffers 170-172; and (4) pair the data in each data buffer 170-172 with the hypothetical PN pilot data in each of PN buffers lSO-182, resulting in four data pairs as follows: 170/180, 170/182, 172/180, and 172/182. In Table 1, the channel to be searched in Modes 1, 2 and 3 is referred to as Channel 0.<br>
[0054] As illustrated in FIG. 5, the searcher 128 can receive and process multiple channels, such as a 3xMC signal processed by the filter 152, using its dynamically configurable architecture. Mode 4 can be used when only a single channel of a multi¬channel signal is to be searched. The system 100 selects one of the channels for searching. The selection can be based on which of the channels is "best" according to some criteria. In Table 1, this channel is referred to as Channel B. For example, the channel with the highest received power can be selected for searching. Thus, Mode 4 can be viewed as a search in Mode 1. 2, or 3, with the best channel (i.e. Channel B) viewed as Channel 0. In this mode, the search controller 130 generates control signals<br><br>
to cause the signal routing circuit 160 to route the selected channel {e.g. Channel B) to the appropriate rotators 162-168.<br>
[0055] In mode 5, two channels of a multi-channel signal, such as a 3xMC signal processed by the filter 152 as shown in FIG. 5, are to be searched. These selected channels are designated in Table 1 as Channel Bl and Channel B2. As in mode 4, the system 100, may use some criteria to determine which two channels of a muM-channel signal are to be searched. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, a Mode 5 search can be conducted using either a single frequency bin with each channel (e.g. mode 5.2), in which case two sets of search parameters may be employed, or using two frequency bins with each channel {e.g. mode 5.1), in which case one set of search parameters may be employed. In mode 5,1, the search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) route the first selected pilot channel signal (e.g. Channel Bl) to rotators 162-164; (2) route the second selected pilot channel signal (e.g. Channel B2) to rotators 166-168; (3) enable each rotator 162-168; (4) enable each data buffer 170-176; and (5) pair the data in data buffers 170-176 with the hypothetical PN pilot data in PN buffers 180-186 as follows: 170/180, 172/182, 174/184, 176/186, where each PN buffer 180-186 contains the same hypothetical PN pilot data.<br>
[0056] In mode 5.2, the search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) route the first selected pilot channel signal (e.g. Channel Bl) to rotators 162-164; (2) route the second selected pilot channel signal (e.g. Channel B2) to rotators 166-168; (3) enable each rotator 162-168; (4) enable each data buffer 170-176; and (5) pair the data in data buffers 170-176 with the hypothetical PN pilot data in PN buffers 180-186 as follows: 170/180,172/182,174/184,176/186, where PN buffers 180 and 184 contain one set of hypothetical PN pilot data and PN Buffers 182 and 186 contain another set of hypothetical PN pilot data.<br>
[0057] In mode 6, three channels of a multi-channel signal, such as the 3xMC signal, are to be searched. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, a single frequency bin is used and a single set of search parameters is employed. This is because each channel requires a rotator (e.g. one of the rotators 162-168) for each frequency bin to be searched, and only four rotators are present in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5. Those skilled in the art will recognize that an alternative embodiment of die system 100 may include more rotators and/or other components (e.g. data buffers).    As previously<br><br>
discussed, the actual desip implementation is a trade-off between search speed and the cost of adding additional circuit components that, inter alia, require electrical power. The system 100 may also use posterior energy combining of the three signals. Those of skill in the art will also recognize that, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the searcher 128 may be configured to simultaneously conduct a mode 6 search {e.g. using rotators 162-166) and a mode 1 search (e-g. using rotator 168).<br>
[0058] In mode 7, an OTD signal is to be searched. An OTD signal broadcast two pilot signals. The search parameters may need to be adjusted to correspond to the parameters for an OTD signal. Otherwise, a mode 7 search can be viewed as a mode 4 or mode 5 search. In mode 7.1, only one of the OTD pilot signals is to be searched for the pilot, thus mode 7.1 is similar to mode 4, and the system 100 may be configured as in modes 1-3, with the hypothetical PN signal data modified to correspond to data appropriate for a hypothetical OTD pilot signal.<br>
[0059] In mode 7.2, both of the OTD pilot signal channels are to be searched for the phase of the pilot signal, thus mode 7.2 is similar to mode 5, and the system may be configured as in modes 5.1 and 5.2, with the hypothetical PN signal data modified to correspond to data appropriate for a hypothetical OTD pilot signal. In mode 7.3, posterior energy combining of the OTD pilot signals may be employed, as may be done in mode 6 with the 3xMC pilot channels.<br>
[0060] It should be noted tiiat, for the sake of clarity, operational modes are discussed with respect to specific processing components. For example, Mode 3 is described using the rotators 162-164 and the dma buffers 170-172, However, the flexible system architecture allows the use of Other components in the searcher (e.g. the rotators 166-168 in Mode 3). The present invention is not limited to the specific embodiment shown in FIG. 5 nor to the component selection described for the various modes of operation. [0061] FIG. 8 is a functional block diagram of an alternative embodiment of a searcher 128 of the present invention, which may be conveniently implemented in any wireless spread-spectrum system. The embodiment in FIG. 8 is designed to take advantage of existing hardware in a wireless device, and in particular to avoid having to add additional hardware data shift registers. The embodiment shown in FIG. 8 is also designed to lake advantage of a searcher 128 that operates at four times the speed of the signal cycle.   This embodiment implements four data buffers 172-176 as fractional<br><br>
portions of a single input data shift register. Similarly, the despreader 482, adder 484, coherent accumulator 486, non-coherent accumulator 490, and peak sorter/detector 492 are logically 
[0064] Table 2, below, summarizes various examples modes in which the search controller 130 of the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 may generate control signals to operate the searcher 128. One skilled in the art will recognize that additional search modes may be employed.<br><br><br>
[0065] In mode 1, the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 is configured lo search a single channel using a single frequency bin and four sets of hypothetical PN signal data. This mode takes advantage of the fact that the searcher 128 can complete four cycles during each cycle of the signal. The search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) enable the energy combiners 488; (2) disable the posterior energy combiner 196; (3) route a single channel signal to be searched to each of the four rotators 162-168; (4) introduce the same phase offset with each rotator 162-168; (5) generate four independent sets of hypothetical PN signal data; (6) pair the data in the data buffers 170-176 with the data in the first tap of each of the corresponding PN buffers 180-186 during the first cycle of the searcher 128; C7) pair the data in the data buffers 170-176 with the data in the second tap of each of the corresponding PN buffers 180
 <br>
cycle of the searcher 128. The paired data is processed by the searcher 128 to produce the peak lists lr4 and the peak list A.<br>
[0066] In mode 2, the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 is configured to search a single channel using four frequency bins and one set of hypothetical PN sipal data. The search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) enable the energy combiners 488; (2) disable the posterior energy combiner 196; (3) route a single channel signal to be searched to each of the four rotators 162-168; (4) introduce a different phase offset with each rotator 162-168, thus creating four different frequency bins; (5) generate four identical sets of hypothetical PN signal data; (6) sequentially pair the data in the data buffers 170-176 with the data in the each tap of each of the corresponding PN buffers 180-186. The paired data is processed by the searcher 128 to produce the peak lists 1-4 and the peak lists A and B.<br>
[0067] In mode 3, the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 is configured to search a single channel using two frequency bins and two sets of hypothetical PN slpal data. The search controller 130 generates control signals to: (1) enable the energy combiners 488; (2) dis^le the posterior energy combiner 196; (3) route a single channel signal to be searched to each of the four rotators 162-168; (4) introduce a certain phase offset with rotators 162 and 164, and to introduce a different phase offset with rotators 166 and 168, thus creating two different frequency bins; (5) generate two independent sets of hypothetical PN signal data and storing the first set of hypothetical PN signal data in PN buffers 180 and 184, and the second set of hypothetical PN signal data in PN buffers 182 and 186; (6) sequentially pair the data in the data buffers 170-176 with the data in each tap of each of the corresponding PN buffers 180-186. The paired data is processed by the searcher 128 to produce the peak lists 1-4 and the peak lists A and B. [0068] One of skill in the art will recognize that the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 can also be configured to operate in other modes, such as modes 4-7 discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 5. When posterior energy combining is desired in modes 6 and 7.3, the search controller 130 generates control signals to disable the energy combiners 488 and enable the posterior energy combiner 196.<br>
[0069] It should be noted that, for the sake of clarity, operational modes are discussed with respect to specific processing components. For example. Mode 3 is described using a particular phase shift with the rotators 162-164 and a different phase shift with<br><br>
the rotators 166-168. However, the flexible system architecture allows the use of other components in the searcher (e.g. using a particular phase shift with the rotators 162 and 166 and a different phase shift with the rotators 164 and 168). The present invention is not limited to the specific embodiment shown in FIG. 8 nor to the component selection described for the various modes of operation.<br>
