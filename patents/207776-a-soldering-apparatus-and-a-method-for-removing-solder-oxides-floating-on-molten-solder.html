EI.ELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an automated soldering apparatus and a solder recovering apparatus for use in the printed wiring board and the like, particularly relates to a soldering apparatus and a solder recovering apparatus which separate solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into solder and solder oxides and recover them.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for separating solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into solder and solder oxides and a method for separating solder oxides in contact with molten solder into solder!' and solder oxides. The present invention also relates to a method for removing solder oxides from solder oxides floating on molten solder.<br>
The present invention also relates to a separating agent which can separate solder oxides from solder oxides with solder adhered thereto or solder oxides in contact with molten solder.  The present invention further relates<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  .<br>
A large amount of solder oxides are formed when electronic parts are soldered on the printed wiring board using a dip-type soldering apparatus or a flow-type soldering apparatus. Moreover, when the solder oxides are scooped up from molten solder or drained from a solder bath to solidify, a large amount of solder is observed to bo adhered to the solder oxides.<br>
Such the solder oxides with solder adhered thereto are sold to the regenerators at a low price. In order to prevent oxidation of solder, an anti-oxidizing agent such as heat-resistant mineral oil has been added to the surface of mo 1 ten solder, or a solder bath and its surroundings have been enclosed with an inert gas such as nitrogen gas so that the oxygen concentration is reduced to mi nim i ze oxidation of solder.<br>
On the other hand, a powdery product obtained by adding a potassium salt to ammonium borohydrochloride is commercially available as a separating/reducing agent for solder oxides, which can separate solder from solder oxides with solder adhered thereto to remove only said solder oxides (tradename / KI.EENOX OR-904P / sold by ELECTROVERT) .<br>
In addition, for example, JP-A-5-6334 9 and the 1 i ke proposed a wave solder  bath equipped with A    means  for-<br><br>
flowing    out    solder    oxides    from    the    solder    bath    together<br>
!<br>
with a heat-resistant fat and oil.<br>
However, the previous selling of the solder oxides to the regenerators has a great loss of solder because a large amount of expensive solder is adhered to solder oxides.<br>
The addition of the anti-oxidizing agent to the sur face of mol ten sol fier makes the solder bath stickily smeary with the anti-oxidizing oil and the like, which leads to not only troublesome cleaning but also adhering to the pr i nted wiring board and the like.<br>
The solder bath disclosed in JP-A-5-63 3 49 also has a si mi 1 ar problem that the heat-resistant, fat and oi 1 is accumulated in a solder reservoir or a duct for! solder is clogged with the fat and oil.<br>
The use of the inert gas results in a higher cost and requires larger and more complicated facilities.<br>
The powdery separating agent containing aminoni um borohydrochlori de as a main component is expensive at. about 6,000 yen/450 g and, upon handling, requires safety management such as paying attention so as not to make the agent., touch with a skin, wearing eyeglasses for protect, i ng eyes, and the like.<br>
QaJE£IS-.QF THE INVENTION A  main object of the present invention is to provide<br><br>
a soldering apparatus and a solder recovering apparatus which can prevent a soldering apparatus from smearing wi th an anti-oxidizing agent such as a heat-resistant fat and oil, which is safe and non-polluting, and which can easily remove solder oxides floating on molten solder.<br>
An another object of the present invention is to provide a method for removing solder oxides which can prevent a soldering apparatus from smearing with an ant i~ oxi.dizi.ng agent such as a heat-resistant fat and oil, which is safe and non-polluti ng,  and which can easily remove<br>
i<br>
solder oxides floating on molten solder.<br>
An another object of the present invent, ion is to provide a separating agent which can easily separate and remove only solder oxides when solder oxides with solder adhered thereto are immersed into molten solder, and a solder recovering apparatus using such the separating agent.<br>
An another object of the present invention is to provide a separating agent which can easily separating solder oxides from solder oxides with solder adhered thereto or from solder oxides in contact with molten solder.<br>
A further object of the present invention i s to provide a vessel for receiving solder oxides with solder adhered thereto or solder oxides in contact with molten<br>
sol Her -<br>
These objects as well as other objects and advantages<br><br>
of the present invention will become apparent from the followi ng description with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
SliMM&amp;RY OF THE INVENTION In order to solve the aforementioned problems,  the present  inventions   features  a  soldering  app-n rat us, comprising a solder wave shape forming means for melt i ng<br>
solder and forming a solder wave shape, and a separating<br>
i<br>
agent dusting means for dusting solder oxide with a separating agent for separating solder and solder oxides, wherein said separating agent is a vegetable member, more particularly, any one selected from the group consisting of offal, cereal grain or flour, bean flour, seed grain or flour, soybean-cake flour and peanut hull flour, or a combination thereof.<br>
The present invention features the aforementioned soldering apparatus, wherein said vegetable separating agent for separating solder and solder oxides is any one selected from the group consisting of offal (such as rice bran, bran, wheat bran, mixed barley bran, naked barley bran, mixed naked barley bran and the like), cereal grain or flour (such as foxtail, Deccan grass, millet and rice), bean flour (such as soybean, azuki bean, peanut, coconut and the like), and seed grain or flour (such as sesame,<br><br>
sunflower,  palm,  rapeseed,  cotton and . the like),  or a combination thereof.<br>
For example, the vegetable separating agent may a separating agent obtained by mixing rice bran and sesame flour in a ratio by weight ranging 100:20 ~ 100:5.   E*y<br>
mixing sesame flour into offal, the duration of Separating<br>
i<br>
acti on is prolonged.	,<br>
Of course, other combinations and a mixture of two or<br>
more separating agents may be arbitrarily used.<br>
In addition, the present invention features a method<br>
for separating solder oxides from molten solder,  which<br>
comprises  a step of scooping up solder oxides float, ing on<br>
molten solder (at around 280-290°C) into a vessel, a step of dusting said solder oxides with any one of the above separating agents (such as rice bran) or a combination thereof, a step of pulling out said vessel from a solder bath to separate solder and solder oxides, and a step of discharging separated solder oxides (oxidized draff).<br>
In addition, the present inventions features an another method for separating solder oxides, which comprises a step of dusting solder oxides float ing on mo1 ten solder with any one of the above separating agents (such as foxtail grain) or a combination thereof, a step of scooping up solder oxides floating on molten solder into a<br>
: t<br>
vessel, a step of pulling out said vessel from a solder<br><br>
bath to separate solder and solder oxides, and a step of-discharging separated solder oxides.<br>
In addition, the present invention features a vessel (which is used in the aforementioned soldering apparatus or method) for scooping up solder oxides floating on molten so Ider compr i ses -a netted basket having a mesh open i.nq (through hole) area of around 1-10 mm% desirably around 1 -2.2 5 mm'7, or a press-worked punching metal such as having a plurality of openings on an underside and each sidewnll, each of openings having an opening area of around 1-2.2'") mm'.<br>
A range sett ing of the opening area of 1-vlO mm*7 in the netted basket or the punching metal was determined by an experiment such that solder separated from solder oxides is smoothly returned to a molten solder bath and oxidized dra f f (solder oxides) remains within the vessel. The const i tuent members of the netted basket or the punch i ng metal is made of a material such as stainless steel and the i i ke, to which no solder is adhered.<br>
The netted basket; is formed so that a diameter of constituent wires of the net is approximately 0.3-0.7 mm and a side of a rectangular opening is approximately 1.0-3 mm. Preferably, a diameter of constituent wires of the net is approximately 0.5 mm and a side of the rectangular opening is approximately 1.2 mm.<br><br>
The mechanism how each of the above separating agents separates solder oxides with solder adhered thereto or solder oxides in contact with (or floating on) molten solder into solder and solder oxides can be considered as follows: an oil component which constitutes the Separating agent: (organic acid R-(COOH)n component contained in the oil (that is, oleic acid, linolic acid, palmitic acid and the 1i ke) ) exert s the reducing effects on metal oxides as exemplified by the following equation:<br>
SnO, * 4RC00H 	» [RCOO]<sn></sn>
In addition, phosphorus (P) and the fats and o i.ls contained in the separating agent are considered to exert the function of prevent]ng solder oxidation.<br>
Moreover, fiber, hydrocarbon and the like wh i.ch countitute the separating agent are considered to associate wi th solder oxides (dross) to inhibit association[of solder ox ides with molten solder.<br>
It is considered that a component which is converted to carbon (C) by heating with molten solder reacts as reprosonted by the following equation:<br>
SnO. + C ~&gt; Sn + CO, Carbon acts as a reducing agent.<br>
Moreover, when sodium (Na) is contained in the separating agent, it also acts as a reducing agent.<br>
Particle si ze distribution of each powdery separating<br><br>
agent is not necessarily required to be regulated. Particle size distribution resulted from a step of polishing unpolished  rice or producing wheat flour may be<br>
used as such  (a range of about 0.01jzm-l mm) .<br>
Incidentally, the components of rice bran, one example of brans, are exemplified as follows: not more than 2% of phosphorus (P), 13.4% of protein, 17.1% of crude fat, 7.9* of crude fiber, 10.2% of crude ash content, 0.06% of calcium (Ca), and major remaining portion of digestj ble components (poultry, swine, bovine and the like) (other components are omitted). Rice bran comprises triturates such as those of f rui t skin, seed coat and germ,! wh i.ch are obta i ned upon pol ishing hulled rice and the like.<br>

Foxtail has 7.0 g of fat, 240 mg of phosphorus (P), 7 mg of sodium (Na),   21 mg of calcium (Ca), 5 mg of iron, and<br><br>
9.9 g of protein (other components are omitted) in 100 g of an edible portion.<br>
Millet has 9.1 g of fat, 270 mg of phosphorus(p) , an extremely small amount of sodium (Na), 20 mg of calcium (Ca),  3.5  mg  of  iron,  and  12.7  g of protein  (other components are omitted) in 100 g of an edible portion.<br>
Deccan grass has B. 3 g of fat, 330 mg of phosphorus (P) , an extremely smal 1 amount of sodium (Na) , 33 mg of calcium (Ca) ,  3. r&gt; mg of iron, and 9.3 g of protein (other-components are omitted) in 100 g of an  edible portion.<br>
Next, of beans, soybean has the following components: *17.r&gt; q of fat, 470 mg of phosphorus (P) , 3 mg of sodium (Na) , 1.90 mg of calcium (Ca), 7 mg of iron, and 34.3 g of prote i n (other components are omi tted) .in 100 g of an edib.1 e portion (see "Kagakubinran" Applican Section, edited by Nihon Kagaku Gakkai, 1973, pp. 13 66-1367, 14 04-140f&gt;/published by Maruzen K.K.).<br>
Therefore,  the above  respective separating agents<br>
other than ri ce bran also contain an oil component and<br>
i<br>
phosphorus, or an oil component and, thus, like rice bran, sepa rate solder oxides in contact with molten solder or solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into solder and so 1 dor oxides.<br>

(sesame, sunflower, pa 1 m, rapeseed and the like) , wh i ch arc r i ch in oil and fat components/ are effective. Fatty acid in sesame contains a large amount of oleic acid and 1jnolic acid.<br>
Next, of cereals, foxtail grain is odor], ess and is easily fed at a constant quantity.

Referring to Figure 3, symbol 12 shows a pore, symbol 13 shows a delivery pump, symbol 14 shows an axis, symbol 15 shows a duct for molten solder, symbol 16 shows an opening, and symbol 21 shows a solder outflowing device. Referring to Figures 1 and 3, a solder wave shape 6 is formed by molten solder which is circulated by a solder outflowing device 21, and solders printed wiring boards 30 which are directed along the arrow in a given pattern.<br>
The solder outflowing device 21 is located inside the solder bath. In the solder outflowing device 21, molten solder is drawn into the delivery pump 13 through the opening 16, and is flown out from the solder outflowing nozzle 1 via the duct 15 to form the desired solder wave shape with the front baffle plate 2 and the rear baffle plate 3.<br>
The perforated plate 4 provided in the middle level of the solder outflowing nozzle 1 is perforated to define a plurality of holes arranged in multiple rows and columns at predetermined pitches for removing impurities, metal masses, lead wires and the like which have been mixed into molten solder.  That is, the plate 4 plays a role as a filter.<br>
Molten solder flown down from the rear baffle plate 3 is circulated by the delivery pump 13 and, as the result,<br><br>
it contacts with air to form a large amount of solder<br>
oxides.  The formed solder oxides move on the surface of<br>
molten solder toward the partition plate 11 shown in Figure<br>
1 and accumulate therein.<br>
The solder oxides receiving vessel 9 is disposed in<br>
molten solder in the vicinity of the partition plate 11.<br>
The vessel 9 is composed of a mesh-like netted basket in<br>
which a diameter of constituent wires of the net is<br>
approximately 0.5 mm and a side of a rectangular opening is<br>
&gt;&gt; approximately 1.2 mm.  Said vessel 9 may be lifted from a<br>
position (A) in the solder bath 5, stopped at a position<br>
(B) , or turned over to a situation (C) .  Furthermore, the<br>
vessel may be stopped at an arbitral position such as a<br>
position (D) shown in Figure 2.  The vessel 9 may be driven<br>
by a conventional and general mechanism such as a fluid<br>
cylinder and a pulse motor (not shown).<br>
In addition, the sifting container 10 is provided<br>
above the vessel 9 outside the solder bath 5.  The sifting<br>
container 10 accommodates a powdery separating agent such<br>
as  rice bran and  scatters  the  separating  agent,  by<br>
oscillating or agitating, through a meshed portion at its<br>
bottom onto solder oxides which have been accumulated in<br>
the vicinity of the partition plate 11.   Oscillating or<br>
agitating may be performed by utilizing an arbitrary and<br>
general means such as an electromagnetic vibrator and a<br><br>
combination of an eccentric cum, a motor and a linkage.<br>
A space for accumulating and receiving solder oxides (oxidized draff) 17 is also provided on the right side of the partition plate 11.  (An exclusive container may be of course  provided).<br>
Next, a method for separating solder oxides floating on molten solder using the soldering apparatus having the above essential features is explained. (Separating method 1)<br>
In tfhe first step, solder oxides 7 floating on molten solder are scooped up by a netted basket (vessel 9) to collect, and then the netted basket is lifted by around half (see Figure 2; the netted basket is at a position (D)) .<br>
In the second step, the sifting container 10 is agitated to dust (or scatter) the surface of solder oxides 7 with the accommodated separating agent 8 such as powdery rice bran. An amount of the separating agent to be scattered may be such that the surface of said solder oxides 7 is almost covered. For example, a little to 0.7 spoonful of the separating agent may be scattered per 100 ml of solder oxides 7.<br>
In the third step, the netted basket is moved up and down or from side to side so that solder oxides 7 are moved up and down from the molten solder surface. This operation is repeated several times.<br><br>
In the fourth step, after confirming that the bulk of<br>
solder oxides is reduced and solder which has been adhered<br>
(or attached) to solder oxides is separated, the netted<br>
basket is pulled up from the molten solder surface (Figure<br>
1; position (B) ) .<br>
In the fifth step, the netted basket is turned over to discard oxidized draff 17 into a waste receiving member and the like (Figure 1; position (C)).<br>
By the aforementioned steps 1-5, the procedure for removing solder oxides which have been floated and accumulated on molten solder is finished. The working time taken for the procedure is approximately 1 minute.<br>
Furthermore, change in the order of, addition of a step or steps to, or deletion of a step or steps from the steps 1-5 may be optionally performed as follows: (Separating method 2)<br>
The above second step, that is, a step for dusting solder oxides 7 floating on molten solder with the powdery separating agent 8 may be performed first. Thereafter, a step of scooping up solder oxides floating on molten solder into a vessel, a step of pulling out said vessel from the solder bath to separate solder and solder oxides, and a step of turning over the netted basket to discard oxidized draff 17 into a waste receiving member may be successively performed (not shown).<br><br>
(Separating method 3)<br>
In accordance with an another separating method, in the first step, solder oxides (solder dross) 7 floating on molten solder is scooped up to collect by the netted basket (vessel 9) , and the netted basket is lifted to a given level above the molten solder surface (position (B) in Figure 1) . Upon this, solder is adhered to solder oxides.<br>
In the second step, the sifting container 10 is agitated to * dust (or scatter) the surface of solder oxides 7 with the accommodated separating agent 8 such as rice bran. An amount of the separating agent to be scattered may be such that the surface of said solder oxides 7 is almost covered. For example, the amount of the separating agent is from a little to 0.7 spoonful per 100 ml of solder oxides 7.<br>
In the third step, the netted basket is descended so that around half of the netted basket is . immersed into molten solder (position (D) in Figure 2). Thereafter, the netted basket is moved up and down or from side to side so that solder oxides 7 are moved up and down from the molten solder surface.  This operation is repeated several times.<br>
In the fourth step, after confirming that the bulk of solder oxides is reduced and solder which has been adhered (or attached) to solder oxides is separated, the netted<br><br>
basket  is  pulled up  from the molten  solder  surface<br>
(position (B) in Figure 1).<br>
In the fifth step, the netted basket is turned over<br>
to discard oxidized draff 17 into a waste receiving member<br>
and the like (position (C) in Figure 1) .<br>
Furthermore, although the netted basket was used as a vessel for receiving solder oxides 7 in the preceding description of separating method 1, 2 or 3, the vessel is not limited to the netted basket and, any other optional members may be used. For example, a vessel may be formed of a punching metal which is perforated to define a plurality of circular or rectangular openings. In one embodiment, rectangular openings having an opening area of approximately 1-2.25 mm2 are provided on an underside and each sidewall of a receiving vessel in multiple rows and columns (matrix fashion) at pitches of approximately 1.5-2.0 mm.<br>
Similarly, in the flow (wave)-type soldering apparatus, the solder outflowing nozzles may be provided at multiple sites, for example, at two sites. Moreover, in stead of scooping up separated solder oxides (oxidized draff) 17 by a vessel such as the netted basket and the like, they may be scraped by a heat-resistant squeegee, for example, a plate made of stainless steel and the like. It is a matter of course that the inert gas may be used to<br><br>
force solder oxides to flow from the molten solder surface into the waste receiving member. In addition, operation for removing solder oxides may be controlled by time switch setting so that it is automatically performed in a regular interval, for example in every two hours (not shown in Figures).<br>
Furthermore, the powdery separating agent dusting means may have any other structures as follows: the structure wherein a cascade (tub) and a hopper with a separating agent accommodated are electromagnetically vibrated as shown in Figure 4, the structure wherein a lower part of a hopper with a separating agent accommodated is provided with a sliding plate having through holes arranged therein as shown in Figure 5, and the structure wherein a lower part of a hopper with a separating agent accommodated is provided with a rotor having a plurality of notches arranged as shown in Figure 6.<br>
Furthermore, the aforementioned soldering apparatus may be utilized as a solder recovering apparatus for recovering solder from solder oxides with solder adhered thereto in addition to as an apparatus for soldering various electronic parts carried on a printed wiring board. Upon this, a method for recovering solder is to immerse solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into molten solder and separate and discharge only solder oxides by<br><br>
utilizing the reducing or anti-oxidizing activity of the aforementioned separating agent.<br>
A method  for  recovering  solder  of  the  present invention comprises, for example, a step of placing solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into a vessel having a plurality of  openings on an underside and a sidewall, a step of immersing said vessel having received solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into molten solder, a step of dusting solder oxides with solder adhered thereto with a separating agent, and a step of pulling out said vessel from molten solder, wherein said separating agent is any one selected from the group consisting of offal, cereal grain or flour, bean flour, seed grain or flour, soybean-cake flour, and peanut hull flour, or a combination thereof. In addition,  in a solder recovering apparatus,  a stationery-type (dip-type) solder bath where solder wave shape is flat may be used instead of a flow-type (wave) solder bath.<br>
(Separating method 4)<br>
Next, Figure 7 is a view showing an embodiment of a method for separating solder and solder oxides.<br>
Referring to Figure  7,  symbols  1-7 enclosed in parenthesis show each step of the separation procedure.<br>
In the first step, a vessel 9 (netted basket,  in which a diameter of constituent wires of the net  is<br><br>
approximately 0.5 mm and a side of a rectangular opening is approximately 1.2 mm) for receiving solder oxides with solder adhered thereto is immersed into a dip-solder bath or a flow-solder bath (wave solder bath) by around half. A temperature of molten solder is  set at approximately<br>
280-290°C (a flow-solder bath 5 is shown in Figure 7).<br>
In the second and third steps, a mass of solder oxides 7 with solder adhered thereto (solder oxides to which solder is attached/solder dross) is placed into the netted basket 9 to a degree of its around half volume. A vessel for scooping up solder dross 7 may be an optional means such as a spoon, a nipper, a pincette and the like.<br>
In the fourth step, the aforementioned separating agent 8 such as rice bran is scooped up with a spoon, and the surface .of solder oxides with solder adhered thereto 7 is dusted (or scattered) therewith. An amount of the separating agent to be scattered may be such that the surface of said solder oxides 7 is almost covered. For example, an amount of the separating agent may be from a little to 0.7 spoonful per 100 ml of solder oxides 7.<br>
In the fifth step, the netted basket 9 is moved up and down or from side to side so that solder oxides with solder adhered thereto 7 is pulled up and down from the molten solder surface 18. This operation is repeated several times.<br><br>
In the sixth step, after confirming that the bulk of solder oxides with solder adhered thereto 7 is reduced and solder which has been adhered (or attached) to solder oxides is molten, the netted basket 9 is pulled out from the molten solder surface 18.<br>
In the seventh step, oxidized draff (solder oxides) 1.7 which remains in the netted basket 9 is discarded into a waste receiving member and the like.<br>
By the aforementioned steps 1~7, the procedure for separating "solder and solder oxides is finished. The working time taken for the procedure is approximately one to two minutes. According to this procedure, above ninety percents of solder which has been adhered to solder oxides can be recovered and the bulk of solder oxides themselves can be reduced to approximately ten to twenty percents of the original bulk.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, the separation of solder oxides and solder can be extremely easily performed in a short time and safely. The method of the present invention does not require wearing a protecting equipment upon handling the separating agent. In addition, since rice bran is used as a separating agent, the method of the present invention is performed at an extremely low cost. It also serves useful for protection of the environment, since rice bran which has been handled as a<br><br>
waste in many cases, can be effectively utilized.<br>
In this method, the separating agent is not limited to rice bran.   Separation of solder oxides can also be accomplished by using any one selected from the group consisting of offal (bran, wheat bran, mixed barley bran, naked barley bran, mixed naked barley bran and the like), bean flour (soybean, azuki bean, peanut, coconut and the like), soybean-cake flour, peanut hull flour and seed flour (sesame, sunflower, palm, rapeseed and the like) described above or a&gt;:&gt; combination thereof.  In particular, seed flour exerts the better separating effect.   An amount of the separating agents other. than rice bran to be scattered is also similar to that of rice bran and is a little to 0.7 spoonful per 100 ml of solder oxides.<br>
Moreover, change of the order of, deletion of a step or steps from the steps 1-7 may be optionally performed.<br>
For example, a step for placing solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into a vessel outside molten solder (outside the solder bath or above the molten solder surface) may be performed first. Thereafter, a step of dusting said solder oxides with solder adhered thereto with any one of the separating agents described above or a combination thereof, a step of immersing said vessel into the molten solder bath to melt solder oxides with solder adhered thereto, and a step of pulling out the vessel from<br><br>
the solder bath to separate solder and solder oxides may be successively performed.<br>
In addition, a step of placing solder oxides with solder adhered thereto into a vessel outside a molten<br>
■0<br>
solder, a step of immersing said vessel into the molten solder bath to melt solder oxides with solder adhered thereto, a step of dusting said solder oxides with solder adhered thereto with any one of the aforementioned separating agents or a combination thereof, and a step of pulling out said vessel from the solder bath to separate solder and solder oxides may be successively performed. (Separating method 5)<br>
Next, a method for separating solder oxides floating on molten solder into solder and solder oxides (Separating method 5) is described as an another embodiment of the present invention. The separating agent to be used in this case is the same as that in (Separating method 4) (such as rice bran) . An amount of rice bran to be scattered to solder oxides is also similar to that in (Separating method 4). The order of the steps of separating solder and solder oxides is as follows:<br>
In the first step, a receiving vessel for scooping solder oxides (a netted basket, in which a diameter of constituent wires of the net is approximately 0.5 mm and a side of a rectangular opening is approximately 1.2 mm) is<br><br>
immersed into a dip- or flow-solder bath to a degree that the upper edge of the vessel is hidden.<br>
In the second step, solder oxides floating on molten solder (solder dross) is scooped up by the netted basket to collect, and then the netted basket is lifted by around half.<br>
In the third step, the separating agent such as rice bran according to the present invention is dusted (or scattered) onto the surface of the solder oxides floating on molten^ . solder using a spoon. An amount of the separating agent to be scattered may be such that the surface of solder oxides is almost covered. For example, the amount may be from a little to 0.7 spoonful per 100 ml of solder oxides.<br>
In the fourth step, the netted basket is moved up and down or from side to side so that solder oxides is moved up and down from the molten solder surface. This operation is repeated several times.<br>
In the fifth step, after confirming that the bulk of solder oxides is reduced and solder which has been adhered (attached) to solder oxides is melted, the netted basket is pulled out from the molten solder surface.<br>
In the sixth step, oxidized draff (solder oxides) which remains in the netted basket is discharged into a waste receiving member and the like.<br><br>
By the aforementioned steps 1-6, the procedure for separating solder and solder oxides is finished. The working time taken for the procedure is approximately one minute (not shown). According to this procedure (Separating method 5), the separation of solder and solder oxides can be extremely easily performed in a short time and at a low cost.<br>
Furthermore, change in the order of, addition of a<br>
step or steps to, or deletion of a step or steps from the<br>
■*■&gt;<br>
steps 1-6 may be also optionally performed.<br>
For example,' by changing the order of the third step, a step for dusting solder oxides floating on molten solder with any one of the aforementioned separating agents or a combination thereof may be performed first. Thereafter, a step of scooping up solder oxides floating on the molten solder into a vessel, and a step of pulling out said vessel from the solder bath to separate solder and solder oxides may be successively performed (not shown).<br>
In the aforementioned two embodiments (Separating methods 4 and 5), the use of the netted basket is described as a vessel for receiving solder oxides with solder adhered thereto or solder oxides floating on molten solder. But the vessel is not limited to the netted basket, and any optional members can be used. For example, the vessel may be formed of a punching metal provided with a plurality of<br><br>
circular or rectangular openings. In one embodiment, the receiving vessel is formed such that a plurality of rectangular openings having an opening area of approximately 1-2.25 mm2 are provided in multiple rows and columns (matrix fashion) at pitches of approximately 1.5-2.0 mm on an underside and each sidewall thereof.<br>
In addition, instead of the flow (wave) type soldering apparatus, the stationery dip-type soldering apparatus may be used.<br>
Furthermore, in stead of scooping up separated solder oxides (oxidized draff) by the netted basket, the solder oxides may be scraped off with a heat-resistant plate or the like, or may be forced to flow off the molten solder surface with an inert gas or the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
