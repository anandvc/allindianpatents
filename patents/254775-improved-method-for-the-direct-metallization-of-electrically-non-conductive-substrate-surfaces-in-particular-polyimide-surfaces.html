				<td>Improved method for the direct metallization of electrically non-conductive substrate<br>
surfaces, in particular polvimide surfaces<br>
The present invention relates to an improved method for the direct metallization of electrically non-conductive substrate surfaces, in particular polyimide surfaces.<br>
The direct metallization of electrically non-conductive substrates plays an important role in particular in the manufacture of printed circuits boards within the context of modern manufacturing processes. Usually, printed circuits boards are made of glass fibre reinforced epoxy resins, polyimides or other suitable polymeric plastics. Such printed boards are often manufactured as multilayer circuits, in which different conduction pattern layers are superimposed. The single connection layers have to be connected to each other by so-called throughplatings. Both for the application of the conduction patterns by means of masks or other suitable methods and for the generation of a sufficient conductivity within the throughplatings, not only chemical copper deposition methods but also direct metallization methods are used in the state of the art.<br>
Besides these applications, the direct metallization of plastics is also used in the field of decorative coatings, such as for example in the field of fittings technique, manufacture of jewellery or the automotive industry.<br>
In the state of the art it has been common since some time to directly coat galvanically non-conductive plastic substrates while renouncing to a previous chemical metallization. Such a method is for example described in US-PS 30 99 608 and DE-OS 33 04 004. However, the methods described there have not been used in practice. This was over all due to the fact that only freshly prepared solutions could obtain relatively usable results. Shortly after initiation of these ones, the quality of the obtained metal deposition decreased, such that only insufficient results were still achieved.<br>
From the German published specifications DE 1 299 740, DE 2 926 335 A1 and DE 31 32 218 A1 methods for the manufacture of throughplatings of printed circuits using conductive lacquers as well as a subsequent galvanic or currentless metallization are furthermore known.<br>
From the German patent DE 38 06 884 C1 a method for the manufacture of throughplated printed boards on the base of a polymeric carrier material or ceramic by galvanic or currentless application of a metal layer onto the surfaces, which are not coated with a conducting metal layer, is known that is characterized in that the carrier is pre-treated in an oxidizing bath, after removal of the bath residues by rinsing the carrier is introduced into a bath which contains a monomer, in particular pyrrole or pyrrole derivates, that is electrically conducting in polymeric form, and afterwards the thus treated substrate is introduced into an acid bath, wherein an electrically conducting layer of polymerized pyrrole or pyrrole derivates is formed, whereupon bath residues are removed by rinsing, if necessary, and a galvanic metallization is carried out.<br>
Based upon this state of the art, it is the o b j e c t of the present invention to provide an improved method for the direct metallization of non-conductive substrate surfaces, in particular polyimide surfaces.<br>
This aim is achieved by a method for the direct metallization of non-conductive substrate surfaces, in particular polyimide surfaces, that is characterized by the process steps:<br>
-	etching the substrate surface with an acidic etching solution that contains<br>
peroxide or peroxosulfate<br>
-	contacting the etched substrate surface with an acidic treatment solution that<br>
contains permanganate<br>
-	activating the treated substrate surface in an acidic activation solution that<br>
contains an oxidizing agent<br>
-	contacting the activated substrate surface with an acidic treatment solution that<br>
contains at least a thiophen derivate and at least a sulphonic acid or a sulphonic<br>
acid derivate and<br>
-	metallization of the thus treated  substrate surface in  an  acidic galvanic<br>
metallization bath.<br>
Such method for the direct metallization of non-conducting substrate surfaces improves the state of the art in that a reliable direct metallization of non-conductive substrate<br>
surfaces under clearly more economic and more ecologic process conditions becomes possible.<br>
Such a process sequence in particular permits to use clearly smaller quantities of chemicals in the individual treatment solutions, which leads to a reduced environmental load.<br>
Furthermore, in comparison to the state of the art, the process sequence according to the invention permits to work with clearly reduced treatment temperatures. Hereby, additional economic and ecologic advantages can be obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the invention, the etchant comprises between about 30 g/l and about 120 g/l peroxide and an acid selected from the group consisting of sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, methane disulphonic acid or phosphoric acid. Advantageously, the temperature can be room temperature during the etching step, whereby supplementary heating devices and energy costs related thereto can be omitted. Suitable peroxides are for example salts of the peroxide sulphuric acid and/or the peroxisulphuric acid.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention the etched substrate surfaces are contacted with a treatment solution containing permanganate, which comprises between about 30 g/l and 60 g/l permanganate in the form of potassium or sodium permanganate and an acid selected from the group consisting of sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulphonic acid and methane disulphonic acid.<br>
According to the invention, the pH value of the permanganate containing treatment solution is 
According to the invention, the temperature during contacting the etched substrate surfaces with the permanganate containing treatment solution can be comprised between 40 and 70°C, preferably between 50 and 60°C.<br>
Subsequently, the substrate surfaces that have been contacted with the acid permanganate containing treatment solution are activated in an acid peroxosulphate<br>
containing activation solution, which comprises between about 30 g/l and about 120 g/l peroxosulphate and an acid selected from the group consisting of sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, methane disulphonic acid and phosphoric acid. Advantageously, the activator solution, with respect to the composition thereof, corresponds to the etching solution.<br>
In an embodiment of the method according to the invention, the activation in the above described activation solution is carried out with ultrasonic agitation. For this, an ultrasonic generator can be introduced into an activation bath or be placed on this one.<br>
Following the activation of the substrate surfaces to be metallized, these ones are contacted with a catalytic solution that comprises at least a thiophen derivate and at least a sulphonic acid or a sulphonic acid derivate, and that preferably comprises 3,4-ethylendioxythiophen as thiophen derivate and polystyrene sulphonic acid as sulphonic acid derivate.<br>
The thus treated substrate surfaces can subsequently be metallized in an appropriate electrolyte for the galvanic deposition of metal layers.<br>
Such an electrolyte can be for example an acid copper comprising electrolyte for the deposition of copper layers.<br>
In another embodiment of the method according to the invention, the treated substrate surface can be rinsed in an acid rinsing solution, preferably in a sulphuric acid rinsing solution, before a galvanic coating with a metallic layer.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that rinsing steps are carried out between the individual treatment steps.<br>
It is a special advantage of the method according to the invention that, with the exception of the step of contacting the substrate surface with an acid permanganate containing treatment solution, all process steps can be carried out at room temperature. This is in particular a reason why significant advantages can be achieved in comparison<br>
to the methods known from the state of the art, since additional devices for setting the temperature of the process solutions can be omitted.<br>
The treatment times of the individual process steps, with the exception of the galvanic metallization, are in a range comprised between about 1 and 3 minutes. The activation of the substrate surface that has been contacted with the acidic permanganate containing treatment solution in the acidic peroxosulphate containing activation solution can even be carried out in less than 1 minute. The same is true for the step of optionally contacting the treated substrate surface with an acidic, preferably sulphuric acid containing rinsing solution before a galvanic metallization.<br>
