DESCRIPTION<br>
INNER CABLE FOR OPERATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an inner cable for<br>
operation. More specifically, the present invention relates to an<br>
operational inner cable having hardly rotating property in which the<br>
stranding length of an inner cable is 9 to 18-fold against the outer<br>
diameter of the inner cable and a strand at the outermost lay is<br>
ordinary lay.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
When a conventional inner cable having little tightening<br>
percentage and large preforming percentage, an inner cable with loose<br>
strand is used at a site such as a non rotating guiding device where<br>
the inner cable is bent while sliding, shape is easily lost by the<br>
tightening percentage and preforming percentage and as a result, an<br>
element wire is subjected to local bending which is caused by<br>
pressuring the element wire on an element wire lay underneath by the<br>
secondary bending and external pressure; therefore there has been a<br>
problem that the durability of bending fatigue is low.<br>
In an invention described in Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 2669754, there is proposed an inner cable for operation<br>
(hereinafter, referred merely as an inner cable) with a stranded<br>
construction which is constituted by stranding a core strand stranding<br>
a plurality of element wires with a plurality of side strands in which a<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
plurality of element wires are stranded around the core strand,<br>
wherein the tightening percentage which is represented by the<br>
percentage of a value which is obtained by dividing a value obtained by<br>
subtracting a measured outer diameter being the diameter of the<br>
circumscribed circle of the inner cable for operation from a calculated<br>
outer diameter being the total sum of the inner cable for operation to a<br>
diameter direction of the respective outer diameters of the plurality of<br>
element wires, by the measured outer diameter is 4 to 11 % and the<br>
preforming percentage of the side strand which is represented by the<br>
percentage of a value which is obtained by dividing the undulating<br>
diameter of the side strands when the inner cable is sleaved, by the<br>
measured outer diameter of the inner cable is 65 to 90 %.<br>
The inner cable described in Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 2669754 is hardly stranded by enlarging the tightening percentage<br>
than a conventional inner cable, deformation can be prevented and as<br>
a result, the secondary bending of element wires hardly occurs. Since<br>
force going to shrink to the central direction of the inner cable is<br>
applied to the side strand of the stranded inner cable, deformation can<br>
be prevented, effect that the secondary bending of element wires<br>
occurs hardly is obtained and the durability of bending fatigue at a<br>
sliding portion is improved.<br>
Fig. 1 shows one example of the inner cable described in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2669754. The inner cable 1 shown<br>
in Fig. 1 is a so-called construction of 19 + 8 x 7. Wherein 19 + 8 x 7<br>
is that one core strand 2 is composed by stranding 6 of the first side<br>
element wires 4 around one core element wire 3 and stranding 12 of<br>
the second side element wires 5 therearound, a side strand 6 is<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
composed by stranding 6 of side element wires 8 around one core<br>
element wire 7, and 8 of the side strands 6 are stranded around the<br>
core strand 2 to prepare the inner cable 1. The core strand is a<br>
so-called cross lay construction and the first element wire is brought in<br>
a point contact with the second element wire.<br>
Further, the tightening percentage of the present inner<br>
cable 1 is a range of 4 to 11 % and the preforming percentage is a<br>
range of 65 to 90 %.<br>
The reason why the tightening percentage is a range of 4 to<br>
11 % is that when the tightening percentage exceeds 11 %, element<br>
wires are hardly stranded and there are problems that wires are<br>
broken by excessive tightening or the surface of element wires is<br>
damaged in production. On the other hand, when the tightening<br>
percentage is lessened than 4 %, durability subject to bending while<br>
sliding is inadequate, as will become clear from the from illustration by<br>
following Examples.<br>
On the other hand, it is according to the following reason<br>
that the preforming percentage is set at a range of 65 to 90 %.<br>
Namely, when the preforming percentage exceeds 90 %, force going to<br>
shrink to the central direction of the inner cable is not applied to the<br>
side strand so mush and secondary bending easily occurs when an<br>
inner cable similar to a non rotating guiding device is used at a site<br>
where it is bent while sliding. Further, as will become clear from the<br>
illustrations of Examples and Comparative Examples described later,<br>
durability is lowered. On the other hand, the side strand is entangled<br>
at breaking in case of an inner cable having a preforming percentage of<br>
65 % or less, therefore it cannot be used.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
The inner cable 11 as shown in Fig. 2 is another example<br>
of the inner cable of the invention described in Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 2669754. The inner cable 11 is those in which the<br>
core strand 12 is stranded in parallel lay strand (also called as line<br>
contact strand). The parallel lay strand is a strand type in which<br>
element wires with different outer diameters are combined and the<br>
strand pitch and strand direction of respective lays are the same.<br>
Since outer lay element wires are fitted in the groove portions between<br>
inner lay element wires, respective element wires are not crossed and<br>
essentially in line contact. As a result, the tightening of strand is good<br>
and shape loss hardly occurs. Further, it shows superior<br>
characteristics that the internal friction (friction by mutual element<br>
wires) of a strand is little and fatigue by the secondary bending is not<br>
generated.<br>
The inner cable 11 of Fig. 2 has aW(19) + 8x7<br>
construction using the core strand 12 having a Warrington type<br>
construction within a parallel strand + 8 x 7 construction. The<br>
Warrington type is that difference between the maximum diameter of<br>
element wires and the minimum diameter of element wires is the least<br>
and suitable for a strand with a narrow diameter in 19 of parallel lay<br>
stands.<br>
Specifically, 6 of the first side element wires 14 with a<br>
slightly narrower diameter than the core element wire 13 are provided<br>
around one core element wire 13, 6 of the third side element wires 15<br>
having the same diameter as the core element wire 13 are provided<br>
between the mutual first side element wires 14, 6 of the second side<br>
element wires 16 with a further narrower diameter than the first side<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
element wires 14 are provided on an upper lay along the first side<br>
element wires 14, and these side element wires 14, 15 and 16 are<br>
simultaneously stranded at the same pitch and to the same direction<br>
to form the core strand 12. It should be noted that the diameters of<br>
the respective element wires of the core strand are not limited to the<br>
above-description. After all, when respective element wires are<br>
stranded at the same pitch and to the same direction, the diameter of<br>
element wires may be suitably selected so that respective element wires<br>
are mutually brought in line contact.<br>
Further, 8 of the side strands 17 are strands in which 6 of<br>
side element wires 19 are stranded around the core element wire 18.<br>
For the inner cable 11, the tightening percentage is also 4 to 11 % and<br>
the preforming percentage is 65 to 90 %.<br>
Further another example of the inner cable described in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2669754 is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
For the inner cable 21, the tightening percentage is also 4<br>
to 11 % and the preforming percentage is 65 to 90 %, and it has a 7 x<br>
7 construction. Namely, the core strand 22 is a strand in which 6 of<br>
the side element wires 24 is stranded around one core element wire 23.<br>
Further, the side strand 25 stranded around the core strand 22 is a<br>
strand in which 6 of the side element wires is stranded 27 around one<br>
core element wire 26, in the same manner as the core strand 22.<br>
Since the tightening percentage is 4 to 11 % and the<br>
preforming percentage is 65 to 90 % for the inner cable described in<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2669754, the durability of bending<br>
fatigue is not lowered even if it is used at a site sliding such as a guide<br>
device. Consequently, the inner cable described in Japanese Patent<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Publication No. 2669754 is used, for example, for a control cable for a<br>
window regulator of an automobile and the like.<br>
However, when the inner cable described in Japanese<br>
Patent Publication No. 2669754 is used for the control cable for a<br>
window regulator of an automobile, there is a problem that abnormal<br>
noise is generated in accordance with the friction of the cable guide<br>
with the inner cable.<br>
The present inventors have studied the cause of the<br>
abnormal noise and as a result, have found that the stranded trace of<br>
the inner cable is transcribed on the cable guide at a process of use,<br>
and stranded unevenness is formed. As a result, when the inner cable<br>
slides on the cable guide, rotational force works on the inner cable at<br>
sliding on the stranded unevenness to twist the inner cable and the<br>
twisting of the inner cable is released and hits the cable guide plane to<br>
generate abnormal noise.<br>
It is described in "All of Wire Ropes (II)" edited by<br>
Steelmaking Activation Study Group of the Kaizuka Chamber of<br>
Commerce and Industry, published by the Kaizuka Chamber of<br>
Commerce and Industry, July 25, 1995, pages 45 to 49 that the<br>
property of rotation centering on the axis of an inner cable means the<br>
rotation of the inner cable, the rotation of the inner cable includes<br>
rotation based on tension, rotation based on contact and rotation<br>
based on bending, and the rotation based on contact among these<br>
occurs by rotation caused by movement to a spiral direction when the<br>
inner cable is brought in contact with a sieve because grooves between<br>
strands are spiral on the surface of the inner cable because of<br>
stranding.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
Further, relation between the stranded angle of an inner<br>
cable and a stranding length (inner cable pitch) is as shown in Fig. 4<br>
and is represented by the following formula (1).<br>
tan = dr /Pi	(1)<br>
Wherein a is the stranded angle of an inner cable, Pi is a<br>
stranding length (pitch) and dr is a lay core diameter of an inner cable.<br>
Further, according to "All of Wire Ropes (II)" edited by<br>
Steelmaking Activation Study Group of the Kaizuka Chamber of<br>
Commerce and Industry, published by the Kaizuka Chamber of<br>
Commerce and Industry, July 25, 1995, pages 45 to 49, an inner cable<br>
in which the compensating relation of stranded return torque is<br>
improved in comparison with a rotating inner cable by elongating the<br>
stranding length of a strand in comparison with the inner cable of six<br>
rotating strands in the composition of six normal stranded strand<br>
inner cables is generally called as a long pitch inner cable or a hardly<br>
rotating inner cable.<br>
The purpose of the invention of Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Publication No. 228277/1997 is to provide a hardly rotating<br>
complex lay stranded inner cable in which the de-stranding resistance<br>
of steel core at loading, the hooking force of an outer lay strand and<br>
the like are enhanced by composing with both inner lay strands with a<br>
normal stranded construction alternately disposing steel cores and<br>
Rang stranded construction, the rotation, shape loss and the like of<br>
the whole inner cable are effectively reduced, and steel cores can be<br>
used for both inner cables with a normal stranded construction and<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Rang stranded construction to improve the hardly rotating property,<br>
shape loss resistance, durability and the like and to reduce cost. In a<br>
complex lay stranded inner cable which is stranded by a plurality of<br>
outer lay strands on a steel core which is stranded by a plurality of<br>
inner strands, an inner strand formed to Z side and an inner strand<br>
formed to S side are alternately disposed to be stranded in the same<br>
direction to form steel cores equipped with the inner strand with a<br>
normal stranded construction and the inner strand with Rang<br>
stranded construction which are alternately disposed. A plurality of<br>
outer lay strands are stranded to the same direction in a normal<br>
stranded construction or Rang stranded construction such that the<br>
de-stranding resistance of steel core at loading, the hooking force of an<br>
outer lay strand and the like are enhanced by both inner lay strands<br>
with a normal stranded construction alternately disposed and Rang<br>
stranded construction, the rotation, shape loss and the like of the<br>
whole inner cable are effectively reduced together with the steel cores.<br>
Thereby steel cores can be used for both inner cable having a normal<br>
stranded construction and Rang stranded construction such that the<br>
hardly rotating property, shape loss resistance, durability and the like<br>
are improved and cost reduction can be carried out.<br>
An object of the invention in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 295187/2001 is to remarkably reduce the damage of<br>
element wires in comparison with a conventional strand inner cable<br>
and to suppress the generation of sound between element wires caused<br>
by friction. In order to solve the problem, in a strand inner cable in<br>
which a plurality of element wires are stranded to form a core strand<br>
and a plurality of side strands which are formed by stranding a<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
plurality of element wires around the core strand are stranded,<br>
element wires drawing spiral by stranding among element wires<br>
composing the core strand and element wires drawing spiral by<br>
stranding among element wires composing the side strands are entirely<br>
formed in the same length.<br>
The invention described in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 295187/2001 found out that the difference in the<br>
length of element wires affects wear resistance and sound generated<br>
between respective element wires, and the concentration of stress<br>
applied to respective element wires is mitigated by equalizing the<br>
length of element wires. Therefore wear resistance is improved and<br>
the generation of sound generated between respective element wires is<br>
suppressed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to "All of Wire Ropes (II)" edited by Steelmaking<br>
Activation Study Group of the Kaizuka Chamber of Commerce and<br>
Industry, published by the Kaizuka Chamber of Commerce and<br>
Industry, July 25, 1995, pages 45 to 49, the rotation coefficient k of<br>
the inner cable is obtained by the following formula (2). Namely,<br>
k = TR/(PxD)	(2)<br>
Wherein TR is the rotation torque (N-m) of an inner cable, P<br>
is tension (N) acting on an inner cable and D is an outer diameter (mm)<br>
of an inner cable.<br>
The rotation torque TR of an inner cable can be determined<br>
by TR = Tr - Ts-cos. Wherein Tr is de-stranding torque generated in<br>
an inner cable, Ts is the rotation torque of a side strand, Ts-cos is<br>
the rotation torque of a side strand using an inner cable and a is the<br>
stranding angle of an inner cable (refer to Fig. 4).<br>
The inner cable torque (namely, de-stranding torque<br>
generated in an inner cable) Tr can be determined by Tr = (P-<br>
tan)-(dr/2). Wherein P is tension applied to an inner cable, dr is a<br>
layer core diameter and a is a stranding angle of an inner cable.<br>
When the outer diameter of an inner cable, the layer core<br>
diameter of a side strand ds and the layer core diameter of an inner<br>
cable dr are the same as the inner cable 1 of the cited Reference 1 with<br>
respect to the inner cables 1, 11 and 21 of Figs. 1 to 3, the stranding<br>
length of the side strands 6, 17, 25 are substantially the same as the<br>
inner cable of the cited Reference 1 and only the stranding length of an<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
inner cable is longer than that of the cited Reference 1 (namely, 9 to<br>
18-fold of the outer diameter of the inner cables 1,11 and 21), then a<br>
torque coefficient k satisfies the relation of 0.065 &gt; k &gt; 0.045.<br>
Further, when an angle of the element wires composing the<br>
side strand appearing at the outermost lay against the axis line of the<br>
inner cable is -3 degrees to 3 degrees (namely, normal stranding<br>
shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)), the elongation rate of an inner cable is<br>
improved (hardly elongated), the breaking load of an inner cable is<br>
improved (the breaking load is heightened) and load efficiency as a<br>
control cable is improved.<br>
It is needless to say for the inner cables 1, 11 and 21, in<br>
the same manner as the inner cable of the cited Reference 1, that the<br>
tightening percentage which is represented by the percentage of a<br>
value which is obtained by dividing a value obtained by subtracting a<br>
measured outer diameter being the diameter of the circumscribed<br>
circle of the inner cable from a calculated outer diameter being the<br>

voltage of 14.5 V at initial on the window regulator 30, constraining a<br>
carrier plate at the joint side of the window regulator 30 and leaving it<br>
at atmospheric temperature of 80°C for 120 hours (after creep test).<br>

room in which a microphone was provided at a site of 160 mm from a<br>
joint to a perpendicular direction under the environment of A<br>
characteristic (Fast) of 39.5 dB (dB of the sound insulating room) and<br>
the power voltages of the window regulator were 5 V and 9 V, using a<br>
noise meter (LA-5111) manufactured by Ono Sokki Co., Ltd.<br>

attaching a pick-up sensor to the joint portion of a window regulator<br>
with an adhesive by using an FFT analyzer manufactured by Ono<br>
Sokki Co., Ltd., a pick-up sensor manufactured by Rion Co., Ltd. and a<br>
