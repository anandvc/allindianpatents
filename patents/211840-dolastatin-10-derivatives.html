The present invention relates to novel compounds having an anti-tumor activity, the use of these compounds in the medical therapy, pharmaceutical compositions containing those compounds as well as to process and intermediates for the preparation of those compounds.<br>
Microtubules are known to be the main component of spindles in a mitotic apparatus of eucaryotic cells, and are also involved in many other basic and essential cell functions. Tubulin, a component of microtubules, has attracted our attention for many years as a good molecular target for anticancer therapy (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1999, 9(8): 1069-1081). In fact, tubulin inhibitors such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids are currently used as important anticancer drugs for the treatment of various solid tumors. However, their efficacy is limited and their toxicity such as myelotoxicity is severe because they lack tumor selective activity. Dolastatin 10 is known to be a potent antimitotic peptide, isolated from the marine mol1Hsk Dolabella auricularia, which inhibits tubulin polymerization and is a different chemical class from taxanes and vincas (Carr. Pharm. Des. 1999, 5:139-162). Preclinical studies of dolastatin 10 have demonstrated activities against a variety of murine and human tumors in cell cultures and animal models. Dolastatin 10 and two synthetic dolastatin derivatives, Cemadotin and TZT-1027 (Drugs of the future 1999,24(4): 404-409) are currently in Phase I and II clinical trials. This new class of anti-tumor agents would provide a new chemical entity for clinical treatment in the near future, however, these agents still have drawbacks in safety, such as myelotoxicity, neurotoxicity and some other adverse events.<br><br>
Surprisingly it has been found that certain dolastatin 10 derivatives having various thio-groups at the dolaproine part show significantly improved anti-tumor activity and therapeutic index in human cancer xenograft models.<br><br>

as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, prodrugs of the compound of formula (I-I) or those salts.<br>
Specifically the present invention concerns R-configuration regarding R4S(0)n group and S-configuration regarding R3 group which are preferable in terms of antitumor activity.<br>
These compounds are effective at inhibiting or preventing the growth of tumors in premalignant and malignant cells and are useful for the treatment of carcinomas forming solid tumors, especially of colorectal cancer, 1Hng cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, cervical cancer and bladder cancer. The compounds of this invention can be used to treat such tumors, to retard the development of such tumors, and to prevent the increase in number of tumors.<br>
The anticancer therapeutic activity of compounds of this invention may be demonstrated by various standard in vitro assays. Such assays described below and in the examples are known to indicate anticancer activity and are assays for cancer therapeutics.<br><br>
Compounds of this invention have the structure depicted in formula I, and anticancer activity as determined by any standard assay, especially assays for apoptosis. The compounds are particularly effective to induce apoptosis in carcinoma cells, causing the death of the cell. Thus a compound has the desired activity if the compound causes carcinoma cells to die when the cells are exposed to the compounds. Carcinoma cells for assays (for example breast, 1Hng, colorectal, etc.) are readily obtained from cell depositories such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or may be isolated by skilled persons from cancer patients. The type of cancer against which the compound is most active is determined by the type of cell used in the assays.<br>
Carcinoma cells, grown in culture, may be incubated with a specific compound and changes in cell viability may be determined for example, by dyes which selectively stain dead cells or by optical density (O.D.) measurement If more than 10% of cells have died, the compound is active in inducing apoptosis. The compounds may not directly kill the cells (cel1Hlar toxicity) but may modulate certain intra- or extracel1Hlar events which result in apoptosis. The anticancer activity of the compounds of this invention may also be determined by assays that access the effects of compounds on cell growth and differentiation. Cell growth inhibition may be determined by adding the compound in question to carcinoma cells in culture with dyes or radioactive precursors, and determining by microscopic cell counting, scintillation counting, or O.D. measurement whether the number of cells has increased over the incubation period. If the number of cells has not increased, growth has been inhibited and the compound is regarded as having therapeutic activity. Similarly, the proportion of cells which have become differentiated after addition of a test compound may be determined by known methods (ie. measuring oxidative burst in HL-60 cells, an indicator of differentiation, by NBT). If 10% or more cells have differentiated, then the compound is regarded as having therapeutic activity.<br>
In vivo assays are also useful to demonstrate anticancer activity. Compounds of this invention may act to reduce the size and/or the number of tumors in laboratory animals such as mice in which tumor growth has been induced. The type of tumor indicates the type of cancer against which primary activity is expected. Specific tumors may be induced by perturbing specific tissues with carcinogens, or by injecting specific types of carcinoma cells. Such an assay is provided in Example IIB. The compounds of the present invention show significant prophylactic and therapeutic activity when eva1Hated against NMU-induced mammary (breast) tumors in rats. Surprisingly the doses and regimens which are effective are free of significant toxicity. The compounds also show efficacy in reducing number of tumors during the course of the experiment (i.e. chemoprevention) at doses and regimens not associated with toxicity. Furthermore, the compounds are therapeutically active, i.e. are able to effect regression of established first primary tumors. The<br><br>
compounds are also preventive, i.e. able to significantly prevent formation of new tumors.<br>
Antiproliferative activity assay was carried out as follows. A single suspension of tumor cells was inoculated to the serially di1Hted 96-well microtestplate. Then the testplate was incubated in the 5% C02 ambience at 37°C for 4 days (2 - 3x 103 cells/well). The degree of cell growth in a monolayer was measured by using WST-8 (Dojindo, Japan). IC50 va1Hes of drugs against tumor cells were calculated as the concentration of drug yielding 50% OD of the control growth. The results are shown in the following table I.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
of the present invention were examined by i.v. administration in mice. The respective MTD va1Hes of the compounds were 14,18 and 10, 8,8,2 and 2 mg/kg.<br>
Thus the compounds of the invention are therapeutically active, producing regression or remission of solid tumors.<br>
The present invention concerns also the use of a compound of formule (I) for the preparation of medicaments, preferably for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of cell proliferative disorders, more preferably for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of cancer, and most preferably for the treatment of colorectal cancer, 1Hng cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, cervical cancer and bladder cancer.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, treatment of cancers is accomplished by administering a compound of the invention systemically to a patient in an amount effective to treat the cancer. By inhibiting growth of cancer (carcinoma) cells is meant stopping growth, causing apoptosis, or causing differentiation, or otherwise changing the nature of the cell to render it innocuous.
