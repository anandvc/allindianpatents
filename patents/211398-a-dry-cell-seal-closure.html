COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION  10<br>
" DRY CELL SEAL CLOSURE<br>
MATSUSHITA LAKHANPAL BATTERY INDIA LIMITED.<br>
As Indian company incorporated<br>
in mdia underthe Companies Act, 1956<br>
of India having its registered office at<br>
Makarpura, G.I.D.C, Vadodara390 010<br>
State of Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification partictilarly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to sealing of Leclanche type (typically zinc- carbon) dry cell and a method of assembling it. More particularly, this invention relates to the construction incorporating a seal closure for the open end of a cylindrical container of the zinc- carbon dry cell (referred to merely as "a dry cell" hereafter) on which the closure has peripherally disposed thereby providing a seal for the container.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In developing countries such as India, consumption of dry cell for example, especially AA type is quite high due to miniaturization of portable equipment. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has classified the AA type dry cells into three categories namely R-6 C (Capacity), R-6P (Power) and R-6S (Standard). Generally R-6C and R-6P type dry cells are used for high or moderate current drain requirement of the equipment whereas R-6S (Standard) is used for moderate to low current drain appliances. Conventionally, R-6S dry cells generally comprises of a cylindrical zinc container, acting as anode with a depolarizer mix extruded/ filled into the container separated by coated paper separator and having a carbon, rod in the center which functions as the current collector for the depolarizer mix. The carbon rod is centered by guiding it through a washer (generally made of wax coated duplex board), just placed over the depolarizer mix, latter also serves as a insulating media for tamping the depolarizer mix for the reaction across the zinc anode and paper lined interface. The cells are generally sealed by inserting supporting washer (generally made of wax coated duplex board) over the cathode mix and then dispensing molten asphalt onto the washer thereby providing an asphalt seal for the cells while also providing an air space above the depolarizer mix and<br><br>
below the asphalt seal to accommodate the discharge gases and exudate of the cell. A metallic terminal cap generally embedded into plastic (generally employs a mixture of high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene, ratio is based on the moldable capacity) making it as one piece moulded cap (referred to as "mould cap" hereafter) components or parts is placed over the carbon rod whereas the rest of moulded plastic material resting on the asphalt sealing which is peripherally crimped at the upper edge of the open end of the cylindrical zinc can and further is ribbed for better sealing. Finally, the entire assembly is encased by an insulating PVC sleeve that cover the sides of the zinc can/or a metal or polymer coated paper jacket that surrounds the cell, with only the positive and negative terminals as bare zinc or with a tenninal plate exposed. The disadvantage of the above-considered mould cap is that it often leads to hair line cracks while manufacturing these moulded component parts or during assembling while nianufacturing the cells due to various reasons, allowing moisture loss from or oxygen ingress into, the battery, both of which- make manufacturing cells incorporating such components less economical.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a sufficiently air- tight battery seal wherein the positive terminal metal cap and washer are manufactured separately and is snap fit to give one piece as seal closure with terminal cap (referred to as dry cell seal ciosure hereafter) of its use in dry celL The said dry celt seat closure also prolongs shelf life effectively preventing moisture loss from, or oxygen ingress into the battery similar to dry cell incorporating mould cap for sealing.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a reliable dry cell seal closure, which is more economical to manufacture than the mould cap.<br><br>
It is also an object of the present application to disclose the construction of battery comprising said dry cell seal closure.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to disclose that construction of battery comprising the said dry cell seal closure leads to better safety under foreseeable misuse than its construction comprising mould cap.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an economically improved dry cell seal closure is disclosed which will effectively prevents the loss of moisture and oxygen ingress into the cell. The dry cell seal closure disclosed in the present invention comprising polyethylene ring washer with U shaped cross section having an outwardly projection at the top upper periphery of the washer to have an airtight placement on the open end of the cylindrical zinc can. The said ring washer has a central circular aperture with its inner lower edge chamfered at predetermined angle adapted to guide carbon rod through it into the metal cap. The positive terminal circular metal cap is snap fitted into the U shaped cross section of the ting washer, loeking-it into the groove to make as one-piece dry cell seal closure, The said dry cell seal closure disclosed in the present invention is more economical to manufacture compared to mould because of being made of separate component parts, requires less plastic material and further less wastage if one of the disclosedcomponent found defective at any stage of manufacturing to total assembly due to reuse of non defective component compared to whole component wastage in case of mould cap. Construction with respect to battery design while incorporating the dry cell seal closure of the present invention is also disclosed through figures.<br><br>
