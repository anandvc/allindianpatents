				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a synergistic composition useful for making<br>
thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals. The present invention<br>
particularly relates to a synergistic composition for making thermally stable nonmetallic<br>
coating on metallic substrates such as super alloy components. This<br>
invention more particularly relates to a synergistic composition from which a<br>
thermally stable non-metallic coating comprising a glass-ceramic selected from<br>
the barium magnesium silicate system can be made for coating metallic<br>
substrates such as super alloy components.<br>
There is a well recognized need, in hot zone components of turbine engines and<br>
heat exchangers, for example, for materials capable of withstanding continuous<br>
operating temperatures in excess of 1000°C. While a variety of high temperature<br>
materials are known, it is common practice to use high temperature stable alloys<br>
known as super alloys in the more severe applications. Characteristically, these<br>
alloys are rich in nickel, cobalt, chromium, or iron, with nickel or cobalt being the<br>
principal metal bases. These super alloys have been distinguished from other<br>
high temperature resistant materials on the basis of being sufficiently resistant to<br>
oxidation to permit operation in an oxidizing atmosphere without a protective<br>
coating. Nevertheless, under extreme hostile conditions, such as encountered by<br>
hot zone components in gas turbine engines, even the super alloys tend to<br>
deteriorate unless protected by a oxygen barrier coating.<br>
A very well known method of protecting metal components from oxidation at<br>
elevated temperatures in a hostile environment is to apply a continuous<br>
monolithic glass coating on the exposed surface. This coating completely<br>
encapsulates and isolates the metallic surface from the surrounding oxygen<br>
containing atmosphere. However, viscous flow of the glass coating may occur<br>
when large surface stresses develop during high temperature use, resulting in<br>
thin spots and catastrophic coating failure.<br>
Another method of achieving higher viscosity is by mixing crystalline materials as<br>
second phase with the glass frits prior to application of the coating. However,<br>
these glass-crystalline mixtures sinter rather non-uniformly, the crystal size and<br>
homogeneity of the resultant microstructure being very difficult to control. Certain<br>
portions of the substrate, therefore, tend to be entirely free from crystals,<br>
whereas other portions have too many (or too large) crystals to sinter well. A void<br>
free coating with this heterogeneous glass-crystal mixture is thus difficult to<br>
obtain.<br>
References may be made to the following U. S. Patents:<br>
No. 3,397,076 (Little et al.) describes fused crystallizable ground and cover coats<br>
for high temperature alloys in which the major elements are cobalt, nickel,<br>
chromium, iron or mixtures. The ground coat is lithium free and contains 35-65%<br>
Si02and12-45% BaO. Examples also contain substantial amounts of R2O, B203<br>
and /or TiO2. The drawbacks are use of two separate coating systems, one<br>
ground coat and other cover coat. The coating composition contains substantial<br>
amount of alkali oxides which is normally unsuitable for continuous use at high<br>
operating temperature.<br>
No. 3,467,534 (MacDowell) discloses glass-ceramic articles consisting<br>
essentially of 20-70% BaO and 30-80% Si02 and having a barium silicate<br>
principal crystal phase. A preferred example is described as considered for<br>
coating metals. This article is related to glass-ceramic objects not applicable to<br>
coatings.<br>
No. 3,531,303 (Bahat) discloses glass-ceramic articles in the alkaline earth<br>
aluminosilicate field wherein hexagonal alkaline earth feldspar or a triclinic form<br>
is the principal crystal phase. The materials are highly refractory with service<br>
temperatures up to 1700°C and consist essentially of 12-53% SiO2) 17-55% RO<br>
where RO is 17-50% SrO and 25-50% BaO, 10-58% AI2O3 and a nucleating<br>
agent. The drawback of the process is same as above, that is it relates to glassceramic<br>
objects and is not applicable to coatings.<br>
No. 3,578,470 (Bahat) discloses glass-ceramic materials in the BaO-AI2O3-SiO2<br>
composition field nucleated with Ta2O5 and/or Nb2O5 that are especially suited to<br>
sealing with tungsten or molybdenum and their alloys. This method describes a<br>
sealing material and is not applicable to coatings.<br>
No. 3,837,978 (Busdiecker) discloses barium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics<br>
nucleated by tin oxide, having a hexacelsian primary crystal phase, and having a<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion in the range of 50-170X10"7/°C.<br>
Nos. 4,256,796; 4,358,541 and 4,385,127 disclose mixed barium magnesium<br>
and calcium magnesium silicate coatings, fluxed with B2Os. The drawback in the<br>
high temperature resistance of these coatings is the use of B2Os. A high B2O3<br>
residual glass (or even a borate crystal) tends to allow the microstructure to<br>
move and flow at temperatures much below the solidus of the primary refractory<br>
silicate phases.<br>
Gas turbine engines and heat exchangers operate in a hostile environment at<br>
operating temperatures in excess of 1000°C. There is a considerable demand for<br>
materials capable of withstanding those severe working conditions. While a<br>
variety of high temperature materials are known, it is a common practice to use<br>
certain nickel or cobalt based super alloys in the more severe applications.<br>
These super alloys have been distinguished from other high temperature<br>
materials on the basis of being considerably resistant to oxidation to permit<br>
continuous operation in an oxidizing atmosphere without a protective coating.<br>
Nevertheless, under more severe conditions, such as encountered by hot zone<br>
components in gas turbine engines in advanced aircraft, even the super alloys<br>
tend to deteriorate very fast unless protected by a suitable coating.<br>
A well known prior art technique of protecting the super alloys from oxidation at<br>
elevated temperatures is to apply an impervious stable continuous monolithic<br>
glassy coating. This completely encapsulates and isolates the material from the<br>
surrounding hostile environment. However, viscous flow of the glassy coating<br>
material may occur when large surface stresses develop during high temperature<br>
use. In some cases generation of hot spots occurs which led to premature<br>
catastrophic failure of the coating as well as the component.<br>
The viscosity being a structural property of the system, can be easily tailored by<br>
mixing certain refractory materials with the glassy coating materials (frits) during<br>
processing (milling), before application of the coating on metal surface..<br>
However, these glass- crystalline mixtures are very difficult to fuse at the required<br>
firing temperature and sinter rather non-uniformly. The microstructure and<br>
homogeneity of the coating is very difficult to control. Certain portion of the<br>
resultant coating generates hot spots which may cause premature failure. A void<br>
free coating with this heterogeneous coating system is thus very difficult to<br>
obtain.<br>
From the above referred hitherto known prior art disclosures it is clear that there<br>
is a definite need for providing thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a synergistic<br>
composition useful for making thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals<br>
which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic composition<br>
useful for obtaining a coating material with superior set of oxidation and hot<br>
corrosion resistance properties.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic<br>
composition consisting of a combination of alkaline earth metal oxides such as<br>
BaO, CaO and MgO, instead of BaO alone and the said synergistic composition<br>
is useful for making a thermally stable non-metallic coating material for metals.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic composition<br>
useful as a thermally stable non-metallic coating material by incorporating a<br>
bonding agent such as molybdenum tri oxide (MoOa) to promote adherence of<br>
the coating to the base metal substrate.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a synergistic<br>
composition useful as a reliable and reproducible high temperature protective<br>
coating for nickel or cobalt base super alloy substrates that are required to<br>
operate at temperatures above 1000°C.<br>
The present invention discloses and describes a synergistic composition useful<br>
for making thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals which obviates the<br>
drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed above as it is capable of<br>
providing a very effective oxygen barrier over the surface of a nickel or cobalt<br>
base super alloy substrate.<br>
The present invention describes a synergistic composition which has the novel<br>
features of usefulness as a well bonded thermally stable non-metallic coating on<br>
metals and for providing a very effective oxygen barrier over the surface of a<br>
nickel or cobalt base super alloy substrate. The novelty is achieved by the nonobvious<br>
inventive steps of providing a blend of alkaline earth metal oxides and<br>
bonding agent which results in the synergistic composition of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a synergistic composition useful for<br>
making thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals which comprises:<br>
32.2 to 38.0 % (w/w) SiO2; 43.8 to 48.8 % (w/w) BaCO3, BaNO3 or mixture<br>
thereof; 0 to 6.8 % (w/w) CaCO3; 0 to 8.8 % (w/w) MgCO3; 0 to 4.7 % (w/w) ZnO;<br>
0 to 5.1 % (w/w) bonding agent and 0 to 10.1 % (w/w) H3BO3.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the SiO2 is such as quartz powder,<br>
quartz sand powder of -100 mesh.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the bonding agent is such as<br>
ammonium molybdate (NH4)3MoO4), molybdenum tri oxide (MoO3).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the raw materials are of<br>
commercial glass-making quality.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the raw materials should be<br>
free of impurities such as alkaline impurities.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention the raw materials should<br>
be free of moisture.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere mechanical admixture of<br>
the ingredients but is a synergistic mixture having properties which are distinct<br>
and different from the mere agglomeration of the properties of the individual<br>
components.<br>
The synergistic composition of the present invention is useful for producing<br>
thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals and can be advantageously used<br>
to form coatings of glass-ceramic on various types of metal structures, especially<br>
for high temperature protection of super alloy components which require a high<br>
degree of performance and reliability under adverse conditions.<br>
In a co-pending patent application no NF - 31/03, we have described and claimed<br>
an improved process for the manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating<br>
for metallic substrates and a process of coating thereof. In the said co-pending<br>
patent application no NF - 31/03, the starting material is the novel synergistic<br>
composition of the present invention.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the practical utility and<br>
effectiveness of the synergistic composition of the present invention which is<br>
useful for making and providing thermally stable non-metallic coating on metals.<br>
The following examples therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
Raw batch materials were mixed in amounts calculated to provide a glass having<br>
a weight percent analysis of:<br>
(Table Removed)  The slip was spray applied to a nickel base super alloy substrate, the surface of<br>
which had been previously blasted with abrasive particles and degreased. The<br>
dried article was then heated to the fusion temperature of the coating material,<br>
about 1000°C thereby forming a glossy green amorphous coating. The coating<br>
was finally heat treated at a temperature of 820°C for 8 hours whereby the colour<br>
becomes somewhat dull green and abrasion resistance of the resultant coating<br>
increases by a factor of 2.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
Raw materials were mixed in amounts calculated to provide a glass having a<br>
weight percent analysis of:<br>
(Table Removed)The slip was spray applied to a nickel base super alloy substrate, the surface of<br>
which had been previously blasted with abrasive particles and degreased. The<br>
dried article was then heated to the fusion temperature of the coating material,<br>
about 1160°C., thereby forming an amorphous glossy green coating and<br>
subsequently heat treated at a temperature of about 820°C.for one hour, the<br>
resultant coating become partially crystallized and losses some of its gloss and<br>
become more abrasion resistant.<br><br>
The resulting batch was melted and then quenched in air to produce a frit. The<br>
ground frit (-100 mesh) was milled for a period of 48 hours in water with<br>
appropriate mill additions as detailed below, including precipitated silica, washed<br>
chromium oxide, china clay and cobalt oxide to keep the glass particles in<br>
suspension and to form an enamel slip.<br>
Mill additions<br>
dried article was then heated to the fusion temperature of the coating material,<br>
about 1200°C, thereby forming an amorphous glossy green coating and<br>
subsequently heat treated at a temperature of about 820°C. for 8 hours whereby<br>
the coating become a glass-ceramic and its colour become somewhat dull and<br>
abrasion resistance of the resultant coating increases by a factor of 2.<br>
EXAMPLE-4<br>
Raw materials were mixed in amounts calculated to provide a glass having a<br>
weight percent analysis of:<br>
(Table Removed)The slip was spray applied to a nickel base super alloy substrate, the surface of<br>
which had been previously blasted with abrasive particles and degreased. The<br>
dried article was then heated to the fusion temperature of the coating material,<br>
about 1160°C., thereby forming an amorphous green, glossy coating and<br>
subsequently heat treated at a temperature of about 820°C. for 8 hours whereby<br>
the colour become somewhat dull and abrasion resistance of the resultant<br>
coating improves by a factor of 2.<br>
The resulting batch was melted and then quenched in air to produce a frit. The<br>
ground frit (-100 mesh) was milled in water for a period of 48 hours with<br>
appropriate mill additions as detailed below, including precipitated silica, washed<br>
chromium oxide, china clay and cobalt oxide to keep the glass particles in<br>
suspension and to form an enamel slip.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The slip was spray applied to a nickel base super alloy substrate, the surface of<br>
which had been previously blasted with abrasive particles and degreased. The<br>
dried article was then heated to the fusion temperature of the coating material,<br>
about 1200°C, thereby forming an amorphous glossy green coating and<br>
subsequently heat treated at a temperature of about 820°C. for 2 hours whereby<br>
the colour become somewhat dull and abrasion resistance of the resultant<br>
coating remains almost unaffected. The resultant glass-ceramic coating retains<br>
all the functional properties on prolonged exposure to high temperature.<br>
The abrasion resistance of the coatings expressed in terms of loss in weight<br>
value is in the range of 2.0 to 6.0 mg / cm2 per 50,000 cycles when tested in a<br>
P. E. I. abrasion tester.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. The synergistic composition is useful for providing thermally stable nonmetallic<br>
coating on metals.<br>
