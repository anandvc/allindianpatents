CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This  application  is  related  to  the  following  commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Applications:  Serial No. 08/769,329 entitled "TELEVISION APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUS DECODING OF AUXILIARY DATA INCLUDED IN MULTIPLE TELEVISION SIGNALS", Serial No. 08/769,333 entitled "VIDEO SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEM PROVIDING INDEPENDENT IMAGE MODIFICATION IN A MULTI_IMAGE DISPLAY", Serial No. 08/769,331 entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING A MODULATED SCROLL RATE FOR TEXT DISPLAY", and Serial No. 08/769,332 entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REFORMATTING AUXILIARY INFORMATION INCLUDED IN A TELEVISION SIGNAL", all of which were filed in the name of Mark F. Rumreich et al. on the same date as the present   application.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  invention relates  to  television receivers  capable  of generating  a  multi-image  display  having  main  and  auxiliary  images   such as   picture-in-picture   (PIP)   or  picture-outside-picture   (POP)   displays. More  particularly,  the invention  relates  to  a  method  and  apparatus  for displaying  auxiliary  information,  such  as  closed  caption  information,<br>
proximate  an  auxiliary  image in  a multi-image  display.    The invention specifi<br>
cally relates to an apparatus for generating a signal representing a multi-stage<br>
video dispay.	BACKGROUND<br>
A  television  signal may include  auxiliary  information in addition  to  video program and audio program information.     For example, an NTSC  (National Television Standards Committee)  television signal may include two bytes of closed captioning data during the latter half of each occurrence of line 21 of field 1.    Closed caption data may be decoded and displayed to provide  a visible  text representation of a television program's  audio content.     Additional closed caption data and other types of similarly  encoded  auxiliary  information,  such  as  extended  data  services information (XDS), may be included in other line intervals such as line 21 of field 2.    United States law requires caption decoders in all  television<br><br>
2 <br>
receivers  haying  displays  larger  than  13  inches  and most television programming  (including  video  tapes)  now  includes  captioning  data.<br>
Although captioning was developed to aid the hearing impaired,  captioning  can  also  provide  a benefit to non-hearing  impaired viewers as well.    Captioning for a multi-image display such as picture-in-picture  (PIP)  or picture-outside-picture  (POP)  displays  is  an  example of this type of additional benefit.    For example, activating a PIP feature produces  an auxiliary image representing the video content of a secondary television program signal.    The auxiliary image is a small picture that is inset into a portion of the main picture.    However, only the audio program associated with  the main picture is processed and coupled to the speakers of the television.    The audio content of the secondary signal is lost.    Because the audio program is important to the comprehension of a television program,  the usefulness  of a multi-image display feature such as a PIP display is severely limited by the lack of an associated audio program.    An approach to solving this problem is to display captions, i.e., visible text, representing the PIP audio program in a portion of the display.    However, the closed caption decoder in most television receivers  processes  only  the caption  information  associated with the "main" picture, not the small picture signal.<br>
An exception -to this general rule can be found in certain television receivers  manufactured  by  Sharp  Corporation  such  as  models 31H-X1200  and 35H-X1200.     These  Sharp  television receivers  display captions representing the audio of the PIP image by providing a switching capability that permits coupling the PIP signal to the main caption decoder.    PIP captions are displayed full size (up to four rows of 32 large characters) at the top or bottom of the screen (a user selectable position). An example of PIP captioning produced by Sharp television receivers is shown in FIG.  1 which depicts a display including main image  100, PIP image  102 and PIP caption  104.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention resides, in part, in the inventors' recognition of a number of problems  associated  with  the described PIP captioning implementation.     First,   main-picture  captioning  and   small-picture captioning cannot be displayed  simultaneously.     Second,  the small image combined with the caption display for the small image may obscure the main image to an extent that is objectionable to a user.    For example, a PIP caption as in the Sharp implementation (up to 20% of the screen area)<br><br>
3<br>
 combined with  a normal  size PIP image (one-ninth of the  screen  area) may obscure more than 30% of the main video display.    Third, the small-picture  caption  is  difficult  to  follow  simultaneously  with  small-picture video because the location of the caption at the top or bottom of the screen is physically disconnected from the small picture and may be a significant distance from the  small picture.     Fourth,  the  appearance  of small-picture   captions   is   virtually  identical   to  main-picture  captions causing users to become confused as to which image is associated with the caption.     The  combination  of these  problems  may  make  auxiliary-picture captioning  that  is  implemented  in  the  manner  described  above objectionable   to   an   extent  that  renders   auxiliary-picture   captioning useless   for  many  viewers.<br>
The invention also resides, in part,  in providing apparatus  and a method for solving  the  described problems  associated  with  the prior art. More  specifically,   the  present invention  provides  for  positioning  auxiliary information,  such  as  closed captioning  text characters,  that is  associated with  an  auxiliary picture in  a multi-image  display  proximate  the  auxiliary picture.    One aspect of the invention involves combining signals representing an auxiliary image,  a border region for the  auxiliary image, and  auxiliary information  with  a  signal representing  the  main  image  to produce  a  combined  signal  representing  a composite image  having  the auxiliary  information  within  the  border  region  and  proximate  the auxiliary image.     Another aspect of the invention involves producing  a signal representing  an  image  having  first,  second  and  third regions representing  a  main image,  an  auxiliary image  and  auxiliary  information, respectively,  and producing a change in the location of the second region such that the third region changes location in response to the change in location of the second region.    Another aspect of the invention involves positioning the third region within the image for indicating to a user that the  auxiliary  information is  associated  with  an  auxiliary  video  program included in the second region.    Another aspect of the invention involves a method  of generating  a multi-image  display  by  combining main  and auxiliary  image  signals  with  border  and  auxiliary  information  such  that the  auxiliary  information is  included  within  a border region  and proximate   the   auxiliary  image.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
For  ease  of description,   the  exemplary  embodiments  depicted in the drawing will  be described in the context of a picture-in-picture (PIP) display  system having a small auxiliary picture inset into a large main picture.    However,  the principles of the invention are applicable to other  multi-image   display   systems   such   as   a   picture-outside-picture (POP) system in which an auxiliary picture located is located outside of ,e.g.,  beside, the main picture.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts the image orientation of a PIP image 202 in relation to a main picture 200 as produced by a PIP captioning image generation system of the present invention.    The position of the PIP image 202 within the confines of the main picture 200 is conventionally defined by a viewer.    Specifically,  the viewer,  through a remote control, defines a vertical line number (vertical position)  and a pixel  location (horizontal position) where one corner (e.g., upper left corner) of the PIP image is to be located.    The active region 210 of the PIP image 202, where the PIP video is displayed, has a typical dimension of one third by one third of the size of the main picture 200.    The PIP image area 210 (active region) is circumscribed by a border region 204.    This border region is approximately  0.25  inches  (0.64 cm) wide.     In  the  normal  operating mode, e.g., without closed captioning, the border of the PIP image is approximately 0.25  inches wide on all sides of the active image area 210.<br><br>
5<br>
 Upon activation of the closed captioning for the PIP image,  the bottom border area 206 is extended to a height of approximately 2 inches  (5  cm). The closed caption information is displayed in this 2 inch wide region (referred to as a closed caption window) as two-lines of closed caption text 208.     The invention provides  a method and apparatus for producing this   extended  border  area 206   and  positioning   the  closed  caption information  208  within  the  extended  border  area 206  (i.e.,  position  the caption for the PIP image proximate to the PIP active image area 210).<br>
Although  the  depicted  embodiment  of the  display  positions the closed caption information for the PIP image at the bottom of the PIP image area,  the PIP closed caption information could as easily be placed in an extended border area at the top of the PIP image area or anywhere else  that is  proximate  the  PIP  image  area 210.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts circuitry 300 for positioning the PIP closed caption  information  proximate  the  active  PIP image region  as  depicted  in FIG.  2.    The circuitry contains a main picture timing generator 312 coupled  to  a multiplexer array  314 and a PIP image  generator 302.     The    multiplexer  array  contains  three  multiplexers  306,   308  and  310.     These multiplexers  are  actively  switched,  on  a pixel-by-pixel  basis,  to  combine pixel values  (e.g.,  luminance and color difference  signals)  and produce the images depicted in FIG.  2.    Specifically, the third multiplexer 310 inserts the PIP image border and caption into the main picture;  the second multiplexer  308  inserts  the  active  PIP  video  imagery  into  the  border region;   and  the  first multiplexer  combines  closed  caption  character  values with  border values  that forms  a  PIP captioning  window.<br>
More specifically, the timing generator 312 has as its input a vertical position 324 and a horizontal position 326 that is user defined for locating the PIP image within the boundaries of the main picture.    For example,  a user can determine the location of the PIP image by activating a "MOVE" key on a remote control.    In a typical application, each activation of the MOVE key moves the PIP image to a different corner of the  main display  as indicated by the  vertical  and horizontal position values.    The system shown in Figure 3 is controlled, for example, by a microcomputer (not shown in  Figure  3).    The microcomputer responds  to the  user-selected  PIP  image  position by  generating  two  digital  values representing  the  horizontal  and  vertical  coordinates  of the  PIP position. The microcomputer stores  the digital values in. memory  and,  in  a typical system,  communicates the digital values to the system in Figure 3  via a data bus  to provide  vertical  position  324  and horizontal position  326.<br><br>
6<br>
In  addition  to  the  horizontal  and  vertical position  inputs, timing  generator  312  receives  vertical  count  328  and  horizontal  count 330 as input signals.    These count values indicate the present main picture line and pixel.    The count values are generated in a conventional manner by counters (not shown in Figure  3) that count in response to timing  signals including horizontal and vertical  sync.     Conventional  sync signal  generation circuitry (not shown in. Figure  3) produces  the  sync signals in response to a composite sync component of a television signal.<br>
In response to  the count values,  the timing generator produces three control signals, namely, CAPTION_INSERT, PIP_INSERT and FSW (FAST SWITCH).    In general, these signals are timing signals that are  active for certain portions  (e.g.,  a predefined number of pixels)  within certain lines.    For example, the location for the caption within the main picture is defined by a number of inclusive lines and pixels.    As such, for all count values that include these lines and pixels, the CAPTION_INSERT signal is active to define a rectangular caption window.    The beginning of the window, e.g., its upper left corner, is defined as an offset of a number of lines and pixels from the vertical and horizontal position values  (324 and 326) that define the location of the PIP image.    The CAPTION_INSERT signal is  coupled to closed caption generator 304 which  generates  signal INSERT CHARACTER VALUE on path 320 for controlling first multiplexer 306  as  described  further  below.<br>
Similarly, the PIP_INSERT and FSW signals are active for certain pixels and lines to control insertion of the active PIP image into the border region as well as insertion of the PIP image with its border and captioning into the main picture.    Signal PIP_INSERT is also coupled to PIP generator 302 for defining where PIP generator 302  should position the PIP image pixels relative to the main picture.<br>
The PIP image generator 302 contains  a closed captioned character  generator  304  that produces  closed caption  characters.     Closed captioning  standard  EIA-608   specifies  a  closed  caption  character format comprising a display character grid of 15 rows by 32 columns with up to four rows of characters being displayed at any one time.    Although these standard  characters  could  be  displayed proximate  the  image  area  of the PIP  image  using  the  present invention,  the  invention  generally  uses reformatted   characters   produced   by   character   generator   302. Reformatting   performed   by  unit   304  comprises   translating   the   standard closed caption character set into a reduced character set,  utilizing  a smaller font size, and displaying only two rows of 18 characters each<br><br>
7<br>
 within  the  PIP captioning window,  e.g.,  the  two-inch  wide  border extension.     The  reformatting  facilitates   viewer  comprehension   and minimizes main picture obstruction.    One example of a closed captioned character  generator  that  provides  reformatted   characters   is   disclosed  in United States Patent Application Serial No.    08/769,332 entitled  "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REFORMATTING AUXILIARY INFORMATION INCLUDED IN A TELEVISION SIGNAL" which was filed in the name of Mark F. Rumreich et al. on the same date as the present application, is commonly  assigned,  and  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference.<br>
The PIP generator 302 produces a control signal INSERT CHARACTER VALUE on path 320 that is coupled to the control terminal of the first multiplexer 306.     In addition  to the control  signal,  the PIP generator produces a PIP picture signal (ACTIVE PIP PIX) that is coupled to the second multiplexer 308.    Using the PIP generator 302 and its accompanying  closed  caption  character  generator,  the  PIP  picture  or image as  well  as  the closed-captioned data is  extracted in a conventional manner from an auxiliary video signal (AUX VIDEO).    Positioning of the PIP image is controlled by the PIP_INSERT signal that is generated by the main  picture  timing  generator 312,  e.g.,  the  PIP  generator produces  the PIP image pixels during a period when the PIP_INSERT signal is active. Furthermore, the timing generator 312 produces a CAPTION INSERT signal  that is  coupled to  the closed-captioned character generator.     This signal controls  the position of the closed-captioned window with respect to the main picture,  e.g.,  the caption character pixels  are positioned at pixels and lines where the CAPTION INSERT signal is active.<br>
The INSERT CHARACTER VALUE control signal (path 320) selects  as  the  output of the first multiplexer either a character value  316 (e.g., a white level pixel value) or a border value 318 (e.g., a gray level pixel value).    The result is an array of character values and border values, e.g., white pixels on a gray background, that when taken together as an array of values depict one or more text characters on a gray background. The output of the first multiplexer 306 is coupled via path 322 to the first input of the second multiplexer 308.    The output of the first multiplexer is essentially  an image  (a rectangular border layer) having  a constant luminance value across  the entire image except in a region where  the closed captioned characters  are inserted.    The characters  are located in  a caption window defined by the CAPTION INSERT signal.<br>
The  second multiplexer 308  combines  the  active  PIP image video with the border layer.    As  such, the second input of multiplexer 308<br><br>
8<br>
 is the active PIP image video (ACTIVE PIP PIX 332) produced by the PIP generator 302.    The second multiplexer 308  is controlled by the PIP_INSERT signal produced by the timing generator 312.    The timing generator 312 produces  the PIP_INSERT signal to create the active PIP image area, e.g., a "high" signal during a number of pixels in each line that is to contain the PIP pix.<br>
Specifically, the PIP_INSERT. signal selects the first input to the  second  multiplexer for all vertical  and horizontal  count  values  outside of the active PIP image area.    For all vertical and horizontal count values within that region, the PIP INSERT signal selects the active PIP image video for output from the second multiplexer 308.    As such,  the active PIP video is  inserted into the  border layer proximate  the  PIP captioning window.    A similar effect is accomplished if the first and second multiplexers  are in reverse order,  e.g.,  the active PIP image is combined with  the  border  and  then  multiplexed  with  the  character  value.<br>
Timing  generator  312  includes  conventional  logic devices  comprising,  e.g.,  gates,  flip-flops,  etc.  that generate  active  states on control signals CAPTION_INSERT, FSW, and PIP_INSERT during time intervals  described above.     The  specific  time intervals utilized in the exemplary   embodiment  are   defined  by   the  following  relationships between horizontal count 330 (referred to below as  "HC"), vertical count 328 ("VC"), horizontal position 326 ("HP"), and vertical position 324 ("VP").   Signal CAPTION_INSERT is active (e.g., high or logic 1) when:<br><br>
That is, signal CAPTION_INSERT is active when HC is greater than 4HP and less than 4HP + 220, and VC is greater than (VP+75) and less than (VP + 72 + 18CAP) where "CAP" is a binary value (either 1 or 0) indicating whether PIP captioning is enabled.    That is, when a user enables PIP captioning, e.g., by selecting "PIP CAPTIONING ON" from a setup menu, CAP has a value of 1.    Similarly, signal FSW is active when:<br><br><br>
9 Signal PIP_INSERT is active when:<br><br>
Values such as the 4 that is multiplied times HP and the 220 that is added to HP define horizontal offsets (e.g., in pixels) that control the horizontal position and width of the border,  PIP image and PIP caption windows. Similarly, values that are added to VP define vertical offsets (e.g., in lines) that control the vertical position and height of the border,  PIP image,  and PIP caption windows.    It will be apparent that these offset values can be modified to vary the position and size of the windows as needed.<br>
Regardless of the ordering of the first and second multiplexers,  the  system provides  for keeping  the  PIP captioning  in  close proximity to the PIP image.    If the location of the PIP image changes, for example,  when the user moves the PIP image (such as using the  above-mentioned "MOVE" key on a remote control), the location of the PIP caption moves  automatically to remain in close proximity  to  the  PIP image.    That is, the location of the PIP captioning is determined in response to the location of the PIP image.    Figure 4 illustrates four exemplary locations  of a PIP image and an exemplary orientation of the PIP captioning for each PIP image location.    A variation of the arrangement of Figure 4 is illustrated in Figure 5  in which PIP captioning automatically changes its  orientation with respect to the main image  and moves within the border layer.    For example, moving the PIP image from a top portion of the main image to a bottom portion of the main image causes  the PIP captioning to move within the border as  shown in Figures 5A and 5B or as shown in Figures 5C and 5D.    Moving the PIP captioning within the border layer can,  for example,  improve readability of the PIP captioning  and/or  minimize  interference  of the  PIP  captioning  with  the main image.    The particular manner in which the PIP captioning moves within the border layer can be selected by a user from a setup menu.<br>
Returning to Figure  3,  a third  multiplexer 310  selects  between the PIP image with its border layer and the main picture 334.    The third multiplexer 310 is driven by a fast switch (FSW) signal generated by the timing generator 312.    The FSW signal selects the first input to the third multiplexer 310  (the PIP image  and border)  for all horizontal  and  vertical count values within the PIP image area including the border region.    For all vertical  and horizontal count values outside of the  image and border<br><br>
10<br>
 region for the PIP image, the FSW signal selects the main picture.    As such,  the PIP image  and its border layer is inserted into  the main picture and the FSW signal defines the width of the border.    The signals at the output of the multiplexer 310 are coupled  to  a display driver  (not  shown but well known in the art).<br>
Using the circuitry of FIG. 3, the display of FIG. 2 is produced. The  circuitry,  in essence,  uses  a layered approach  to image  generation. Specifically,  a closed caption text character value is combined with  a border value  to produce  a border layer (a gray  layer having  a predefined size and containing closed caption text), then the active PIP pix is combined with  the border layer,  and lastly,  the main pix  is  multiplexed with  the PIP image,  its  border and text to create the comprehensive PIP display of FIG. 2.    Because the system provides for locating the closed-caption text in close proximity to the PIP image, a viewer can easily comprehend  the closed caption text in reference to the PIP image.<br>
Although   various   embodiments   which   incorporate   the teachings  of the present invention  have  been  shown  and  described  in detail  herein,  those  skilled in the art can readily devise many other varied  embodiments  that still  incorporate  these teachings.     For example, various  configurations  of the border region shown in Figure 2  are possible.     First, various orientations of the border region are possible  as discussed above and shown in Figures 4 and 5.    In addition,  the border region  extension  containing  the  auxiliary  information  can  be  adjacent to the PIP image as shown in Figures 2, 4 and 5 or can be located spaced slightly from the PIP image, e.g., with a region of different color and/or brightness.<br><br>
