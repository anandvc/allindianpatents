 <br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
A Jaw assembly allowing fixing and unfixing of a switching device to a cradle is described. The cradle allows housing of various such switching devices with help of the jaw assembly as described. Such switching devices may be circuit breakers of various kinds.<br>
The jaw assembly described in various embodiments of this invention provides the flexibility of the assembly in fixing of the switching device while also providing a larger surface area exposed. Among various advantages, this feature also provides consequent enhancement in heat dissipation from the surfaces through aiding natural convection currents of surrounding air.<br>
This feature of the present invention also increases the nominal current rating of circuit breaker without resorting to increases in volume of copper of the current carrying components.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention Figure 1 shows a sectional view of jaw assembly on cradle terminal. A cradle support 50 is clamped between cross pieces 51, 52, holds atleast one cradle terminal 10 and atleast one jaw unit 20. Cross pieces are supported by side frame 53, which comprises a rack-in arrangement enabling the circuit breaker housing to be inserted or extracted. Figure 2 shows the cross-sectional view of the jaw assembly for one of the phase of a multi phase circuit breaker according to an embodiment herein. As shown in figure 2, each phase of the circuit breaker comprises of cradle terminal 10, jaw assembly 20, breaker terminal 30 and a switching arrangement. Therefore, as a<br>
<br>
 <br>
skilled person in the art would realize various jaw units and cradle terminals may be arranged based on the number of phases of the circuit breaker. Cradle terminal remains fixed and constrained between cradle supports 50 on a base 16 and a protrusion 14 on each side of the jaw assembly as shown in figure 2. Each jaw unit 20 is fixed on the cradle terminal and when the circuit breaker is extracted from cradle frame, jaw unit remains on cradle terminal 10. The protrusion 14 restricts the forward movement of the cradle terminal. The cradle terminal as described in the present invention allows better flexibility in fixing of the switching device, while at same time providing a rugged arrangement of the jaw unit on the cradle terminal. The cradle terminal 10 comprises of two protruded parts 11a and a base protrusion 11b. The protruded parts 11a and the base protrusion together form two hollow cylindrical structure with open ends when seen along the cross-section. The hollow cylindrical structures have axes 15a and 15b respectively, which are parallel to each other. Each jaw unit may be fixed in the hollow cylindrical structures formed by the base protrusion and the protruded parts. The open ends of the hollow cylinders allow the jaw assembly to fit into the base protrusion and the protruded parts. The opposing forces from each of the jaw units ( ) are cancelled at the base protrusion.<br>
Each jaw unit engages with the cradle terminal at the protruded surface and base protrusion. In particular a circular surface 22 of the jaw unit engages with the inner wall of the protruded parts and the base protrusion.<br>
<br>
 <br>
An E shaped breaker terminal may be engaged with the jaw units. The breaker terminal 30 comprises of entry surface 32 that eases jaw insertion into breaker terminal and two parallel U shaped contact surfaces 31 where contact surface 23 of jaw mates and provides connection with the main power circuit. This breaker terminal may be connected to basic switching unit 40.<br>
According to an embodiment herein the figure 3 shows an exploded view of single jaw unit. The jaw unit comprises of two twin jaw fingers stack placed opposite to each other. Further according to an embodiment herein the side view of jaw assembly with cradle and breaker terminal is shown in figure 4. Each jaw unit 20 comprises of two twin jaw fingers stack 21 which provides connection between cradle terminal and breaker terminal to enable current flow after the breaker terminal is engaged with the jaw units. A side support 27 on each side of the jaw unit which restraints the vertical movement of jaw while being guided in slot 17 on cradle terminal 10 is provided. A guiding pin 24 which enables the swiveling motion of jaw fingers stack about the axis of the guiding pin when the jaw unit is not connected to cradle terminal 10 that eases jaw's entry into cradle terminal.<br>
A spring 25 provides the required contact pressure, and spring support 26 that supports spring that compresses against this support. Any type of spring may be used in the embodiments of the invention such as for example leaf spring, compression spring etc.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Figure 5 shows an isometric view of jaw assembly with cradle terminal as per an embodiment of the present invention. The present invention allows the jaw units to be arranged vertically as well as horizontally. During arrangement of the jaw units in vertical position with respect to each other the arrangement allows for easy flow of heat through convection. This reduces the temperature of the arrangement and therefore improves the overall current carrying capacity of the switching device.<br>
Figure 6 is sectional view of the breaker comprising jaw assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention. With vertical arrangement, convection and surface area can be increased at the same time. Vertical arrangement naturally aids heat dissipation because of upward flow of surrounding air through the jaw assembly. If certain vents can be provided in the cradle support that holds the jaw and cradle terminal so that air circulation through current carrying part increases, it will further release the generated heat to the surrounding. Also the jaw assembly as described in the present invention makes it possible to choose the number of plug-in contacts according to the rated current and the electrodynamic withstand of the installation. The number and location of jaw unit may also be determined by the choice of the circuit breaker. Thus this configuration provides a great flexibility for a single frame.<br>
