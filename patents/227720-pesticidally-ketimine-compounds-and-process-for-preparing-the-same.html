(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which A and R]-R3 are as defined above is reacted with a compound of the general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>

This reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction which can be carried out under the reaction conditions conventionally used in such a case.

Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out with phase transfer catalysis in an organic solvent for example methylene chloride, in the presence of an aqueous alkaline solution, for example sodium hydroxide solution, and of a phase transfer catalyst, for example tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, at room temperature.<br>
The resulting compounds of the formula I can be isolated and purified by methods known per se.

A compound of the general formula<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which X, Y, Rt and R2 are as defined above is reacted with hydroxylamine or a salt thereof, for example the hydrochloride. The reaction is carried out advantageously in pyridine or methanol as the solvent at temperatures between -20°C and +80°C or the boiling point of methanol, preferably in a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C, a base being required if methanol is used, for example an alkali metal carbonate, such as potassium carbonate, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or diazabicyclononane, pyridine or silver oxide.<br>

The ketones of the general formula VI and their preparation are described, for example, in EP-370 629, EP-506 149, EP-403 618, EP-414 153, EP-463 488, EP-472 300, EP-460 575, WO-92/18494 and in other publications.<br>
E) To prepare a compound of the formula I in which A, X, Y and Ri-R3 are as defined for formula I but in which R3 is not hydrogen, a procedure is followed in which, for example:<br>

(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
in which A, X, Y and RrR3 are as defined above is reacted with a methylating agent, for example methyl iodide, dimethyl sulfate or diazomethane. The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a base, for example potassium carbonate or sodium hydride, in a suitable solvent and at suitable reaction temperatures (see, for example, H.S. Anker und H.T. Clarke; Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol. 3, 172).<br><br>
F) To prepare a compound of the formula VII in which A, X, Y and RrR3 are as defined for formula I, a procedure is advantageously followed in which:<br>

(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which A, Y and Rj-R^ are as defined above is reacted with a formate in the presence of a base analogously to the method described in EP-A-178 826, or is subjected to nitrosation with nitrous acid or a nitrite in the presence of a base analogously to the method described in EP-A-254 426.<br>
A further possibility of synthesizing a compound of the formula Vn is the following reaction:<br>

The novel compounds of the formulae Vn, VIII and IX are also provided by the invention. It has now been found that compounds of the formula I have a microbicidal spectrum for<br><br>
controlling phytopathogenic microorganisms, in particular fungi, which is particularly favourable for practical requirements. They have very advantageous curative, preventive and, in particular, systemic properties and can be used for protecting a large number of crop plants. Using the active ingredients of the formula I, the pests which are found on plants or parts of plants (fruits, flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers, roots) of various crops of useful plants can be contained or destroyed, and even parts of plants which are formed at a later point in time remain free from phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can furthermore be used as seed-dressing agents for the treatment of seed (fruits, tubers, grains) and nursery plants for the protection against fungal infections and against soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
Compounds of the formula I are active for example against phytopathogenic fungi which belong to the following classes: Fungi imperfecti (in particular Botrytis, furthermore Pyricularia, Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora, Cercosporella and Alternaria); Basidiomycetes (for example Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia); Ascomycetes (for example Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula); Oomycetes (for example Phytophthora, Peronospora, Bremia, Pythium, Plasmopara).<br>
Compounds of the formula I are furthermore valuable active ingredients against insects and Acarina which are found on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture and horticulture, in particular in crops of rice, cotton, vegetables and fruit, and in forests, and are well tolerated by warm-blooded species, fish and plants. The compounds I are particularly suitable for controlling insects in crops of rice, fruit and vegetables, in particular plant-injurious insects. Other fields of application for the active ingredients of the invention are the protection of stored products and materials and, in the hygiene sector, in particular the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock. The compounds of the formula I are active against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive, but also resistant, pest species. Their activity can become apparent, for example, from the destruction of the pests, either immediately or only after some time has elapsed, for example during molting, or from reduced oviposition and/or hatching rates.<br>

The action of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention and of the compositions comprising them can be broadened considerably and adapted to prevailing circumstances by adding other microbicides, insecticides and/or acaricides. Representatives of the following active ingredient classes are examples of suitable additives: organophosphorus compounds, nitrophenols and derivatives, formamidines, ureas, carbamates, pyrethroids, chlorinated hydrocarbons and Bacillus thuringiensis preparations.<br>
As a rule, active ingredients of the formula I are used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plants to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. These other active ingredients can be fertilizers, trace element mediators or other preparations which have an effect on plant growth. Selective herbicides and also insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of a plurality of these preparations, with or without other carriers conventionally used in the art of formulation, surfactants or other application-enhancing additives, can also be used.<br>
Suitable carriers and additives can be solid or liquid and are those substances which are expedient in the art of formulation, for example natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers.<br>
The following are suitable solvents: aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions C8 to C12, for example xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes, phthalates such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide, and unepoxidized or epoxidized vegetable oils, such as epoxidized coconut oil or soya oil; or water.<br><br>
Solid carriers which are generally used, for example for dusts and dispersible powders, are ground natural rocks, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite.<br>
Particularly advantageous application enhancing additives which may result in a greatly reduced rate of application are, moreover, natural (animal or vegetable) or synthetic phospholipids from the series of the cephalins and lecithins, which can be obtained from, for example, soya beans.<br>
Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active ingredient of the formula I to be formulated, non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants which have good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Surfactants are also to be understood as meaning surfactant mixtures.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants can be so-called water-soluble salts and also water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds.<br>
Soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), for example the sodium salts or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural mixtures of fatty acids which can be obtained from, for example, coconut oil or tallow oil. The fatty acid methyltaurates must also be mentioned.<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants are polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols which have 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical of the alkylphenols.<br>
Examples of non-ionic surfactans are nonylphenol polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol.<br>
Other suitable substances are fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
The cationic surfactants are mainly quaternary ammonium salts which have, as N-substituents, at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms and, as further substituents, lower, halogenated or free alkyl, benzyl or lower hydroxyalkyl radicals.<br><br>
As a rule, the agrochemical preparations comprise 0.1 to 99 %, in particular 0.1 to 95 %, of active ingredient of the formula I, 99.9 to 1 %, in particular 99.9 to 5 %, of a solid or liquid additive and 0 to 25 %, in particular 0.1 to 25 %, of a surfactant.<br>
While concentrated compositions are more preferred as commercial products, the end consumer will, as a rule, use dilute compositions.<br>
The compositions can also comprise other additives such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers, fertilizers or other active ingredients for achieving specific effects.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or combinations comprising the active ingredient of the formula I together or without a solid or liquid additive, are produced in a known manner, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with an extender, for example a solvent (mixture), a solid carrier and, if appropriate, surf ace-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
A preferred process for applying an active ingredient of the formula I or an agrochemical composition which comprises at least one of these active ingredients, is application to the foliage (foliar application). Frequency and rate of application depend on the danger of attack by the pathogen in question. However, the active ingredients of the formula I can also reach the plant via the soil through the root system (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid preparation or by incorporating the substances in solid form into the soil, for example in the form of granules (soil application). In the case of paddy rice, such granules can be metered out into the flooded rice field. Alternatively, the compounds of the formula I can be applied to seed kernels (coating), either by soaking the kernels in a liquid preparation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid preparation. In principle, any type of plant propagation material can be protected using the compounds of the formula I, for example seed, roots or stalks.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are used as pure compounds or, preferably, together with the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation. To this end, they are advantageously processed in the known manner, for example to give emulsion concentrates, spreadable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and encapsulations, for example in polymeric substances. The methods of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting,<br><br>
broadcasting, painting on or pouring, as well as the nature of the compositions are selected to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances. Favourable rates of application are, as a rule, 1 g to 2 kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per ha, preferably 25 g to 800 g of a.i./ha, particularly preferably 50 g to 400 g of a.i./ha. When used as seed dressing products, dosage rates of 0.001 g to 1.0 g of active ingredient are advantageously used per kg of seed.<br><br>

A solution of 15.0 g of p-methylpropiophenone and 20 ml of isopentyl nitrite in 30 ml of methanol is slowly added dropwise to 20 ml of sodium methylate (30 % in methanol). After the mixture has been stirred for 5 hours, 30 ml of water are added dropwise, and the mixture is subsequently acidified using acetic acid. The mixture is extracted using ethyl acetate, and the extract is washed with water, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is recrystallized from diethyl ether/n-hexane.

The organic phase is washed twice using saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once using saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent is distilled off in vacuo. H-3 crystallizes from diethyl ether/n-hexane in the form of colorless crystals of melting point 98-101°C (Comp.

3. Biological Examples A) Microbicidal action Example B_-l: Action against Phytophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
a) Curative action<br>
Tomato plants cv. "Roter Gnom" are grown for three weeks and then sprayed with a zoospore suspension of the fungus and incubated in a cabinet at 18 to 20° and saturated atmospheric humidity. The humidification is interrupted after 24 hours. After the plants have dried, they are sprayed with a mixture which comprises the active ingredient, formulated as a wettable powder, at a concentration of 200 ppm. After the spray coating has dried, the plants are returned to the humid chamber for 4 days. Number and size of the typical leaf spots which have developed after this period are used to assess the activity of the test substances.<br><br>
b) Preventive-systemic action<br>
The active ingredient, formulated as a wettable powder, is applied at a concentration of 60 ppm (relative to the soil volume) to the soil surface of three-week old tomato plants cv. "Roter Gnom" in pots. After the plants have been left to stand for three days, the underside of the leaves is sprayed with a zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans. The plants are then kept for 5 days in a spray cabinet at 18 to 20°C and saturated atmospheric humidity. After this period, typical leaf spots develop, whose number and size are used for assessing the activity of the test substances.<br>
While untreated, but infected, control plants show an infestation of 100 %, the active ingredients of the formula I in accordance with one of the tables, in particular the compounds No. 1.5, 1.24, 1.117, 2.24, 2.74 and 3.24, allow the infestation in both tests to be reduced to 20 % or less.<br>
Example B-2: Action against Plasmopara viticola (Bert, et Curt.) (Berl. et De Toni) on vines<br>
a)	Residual-preventive action<br>
Vine cuttings cv. "Chasselas" are grown in the greenhouse. When they have reached the 10-leaf stage, 3 plants are sprayed with a mixture (200 ppm of active ingredient). After the spray coating on the plants has dried, the leaf underside is inoculated uniformly with a spore suspension of the fungus. The plants are subsequently kept in a humid chamber for 8 days. After this period, the disease symptoms of the control plants are clearly developed. Number and size of the lesions on the treated plants are used to assess the activity of the test substances.<br>
b)	Curative action<br>
Grape cuttings cv. "Chasselas" are grown in the greenhouse and, when they have reached the 10-leaf stage, are inoculated on the underside of the leaves with a spore suspension of Plasmopara viticola. After the plants have remained for 24 hours in a humid cabinet, they are sprayed with a mixture of active ingredient (200 ppm of active ingredient). The plants are subsequently kept for 7 more days in the humid cabinet. After this period, the disease symptoms have developed on the control plants. Number and size of the lesions on the treated plants are used to assess the activity of the test substances. In comparison with the control plants, the infestation of plants which have been treated with active ingredients of the formula 1 is 20 % or less.<br><br>
Example B-3: Action against Pythium debaryanum on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris)<br>
a)	Action after soil application<br>
The fungus is grown on sterile oat grains and added to a mixture of soil and sand. This inoculated soil is filled into flower pots and sugar beet seeds are sown. Immediately after sowing, the test preparations, formulated as wettable powders, are poured over the soil in the form of an aqueous suspension (20 ppm of active ingredient relative to the soil volume). Thereupon, the pots are placed in a greenhouse for 2-3 weeks at 20-24°C. All the time, the soil is kept uniformly moist by spraying it gently with water. When the test is evaluated, the emergence of the sugar beet plants and the proportion of healthy and diseased plants is determined.<br>
b)	Action after seed-dressing<br>
The fungus is grown on sterile oat grains and added to a mixture of soil and sand. This inoculated soil is filled into flower pots and sugar beet seeds which have been dressed with the test preparations, formulated as seed-dressing powders (1000 ppm of active ingredient relative to the weight of the seeds), are sown. The pots together with the seeds are placed in a greenhouse at 20-24°C for 2-3 weeks. The soil is kept uniformly moist by gently spraying it with water. When the test is evaluated, the emergence of the sugar beet plants and the proportion of healthy and diseased plants is determined. After treatment with active ingredients of the formula I, in particular with the compounds No. 1.5, 1.24, 1.117, 2.24, 2.74 and 3.24, over 80 % of the plants emerge and have a healthy appearance. In the control pots, only few plants of unhealthy appearance have emerged.<br>
Example B-4: Residual-protective action against Cercospora arachidicola on groundnuts Groundnut plants 10 to 15 cm high are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture (0.02 % of active ingredient) and, 48 hours later, inoculated with a conidia suspension of the fungus. The plants are incubated for 72 hours at 21° and high atmospheric humidity and subsequently placed in a greenhouse until the typical leaf spots have developed. The action of the active ingredient is assessed 12 days after the inoculation on the basis of the number and size of the leaf spots. Active ingredients of the formula I cause a reduction in leaf spots to less than approximately 10 % of the leaf surface area. In some cases, the disease is reduced completely (0-5 % infestation).<br>
Example B-5: Action against Puccinia graminis on wheat<br><br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
6 days after sowing, wheat plants are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture (0.02 % of active ingredient) and, 24 hours later, inoculated with a ureidospore suspension of the fungus. After an incubation time of 48 hours (conditions: relative humidity of 95 to 100 % at 20°), the plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°. 12 days after the inoculation, the development of rust pustules is assessed.<br>
b)	Systemic action<br>
5 days after sowing, an aqueous spray mixture (0.006 % of active ingredient relative to the soil volume) is poured next to wheat plants. Any contact of the spray mixture with aerial parts of the plants is carefully avoided. 48 hours later, the plants are inoculated with a ureidospore suspension of the fungus. After an incubation time of 48 hours (conditions: relative humidity of 95 to 100 % at 20°), the plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°. 12 days after the inoculation, the development of rust pustules is assessed. Compounds of the formula I, in particular those of Table 1, in particular No. 1.5, 1.24, 1.117, 2.74, cause a marked reduction in fungus infestation, in some cases down to 10-0 %.<br>
Example B-6: Action against Pyricularia oryzae on rice<br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
Rice plants are grown for two weeks and then sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture (0.02 % of active ingredient), and, 48 hours later, inoculated with a conidia suspension of the fungus. The fungus infestation is assessed 5 days after the inoculation, during which period the relative atmospheric humidity was kept at 95 to 100 % and the temperature at 22°.<br>
b)	Systemic action<br>
An aqueous spray mixture (0.006 % of active ingredient relative to the soil volume) is poured next to 2-week old rice plants. Contact of the spray mixture with the aerial parts of the plants is carefully avoided. The pots are then filled with such an amount of water that the lowest parts of the stems of the rice plants are submerged. After 96 hours, the plants are inoculated with a conidia suspension of the fungus and kept for 5 days at a relative atmospheric humidity of 95 to 100 % and a temperature of 24°C. In many cases, compounds of the formula I prevent the development of disease on the infected plants.<br><br>
Example B-7: Residual-protective action against Venturia inaequalis on apples Apple cuttings having fresh shoots 10 to 20 cm in length are sprayed to drip point with a spray mixture (0.02 % of active ingredient) and, 24 hours later, inoculated with a conidia suspension of the fungus. The plants are incubated for 5 days at a relative atmospheric humidity of 90 to 100 % and kept in a greenhouse for a further 10 days at 20 to 24°. The infestation with scab was assessed 15 days after the inoculation. Most of the compounds of the formula I of one of Tables 1,2 or 3 have a sustainable action against scab diseases.<br>
Example B-8: Action against Erysiphe graminis on barley<br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
Barley plants approximately 8 cm high are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture (0.02 % of active ingredient) and, 3 to 4 hours later, dusted with conidia of the fungus. The inoculated plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°. The fungus infestation is assessed 10 days after the inoculation.<br>
b)	Systemic action<br>
An aqueous spray mixture (0.002 % of active ingredient relative to the soil volume) is poured next to barley plants approximately 8 cm high. Contact of the spray mixture with aerial parts of the plants is carefully avoided. 48 hours later, the plants are dusted with conidia of the fungus. The inoculated plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°. The fungus infestation is assessed 10 days after the inoculation.<br>
Compounds of the formula I, in particular compounds No. 1.117, 2.24 and 3.24, are generally capable of reducing the disease to less than 20 %, in some cases also completely.<br>
Example B-9: Action against Podosphaera leucotricha on apple shoots<br>
Residual-protective action<br>
Apple cuttings having fresh shoots approximately 15 cm long are sprayed with a spray<br>
mixture (0.06 % of active ingredient). After 24 hours, the treated plants are inoculated<br>
with a conidia suspension of the fungus and placed in a controlled-environment cabinet at<br>
a relative atmospheric humidity of 70 % and at 20°C. The fungus infestation is assessed<br>
12 days after the inoculation.<br>
Active ingredients of the formula 1 allow the disease to be reduced to less than 20 %.<br>
Control plants show a disease level of 100 %.<br>
Example B-10: Action against Botrytis cinerea on apple fruits. Residual- protective action<br><br>
Artificially wounded apples are treated by applying dropwise a spray mixture (0.02 % of<br>
active ingredient) to the wounds. The treated fruits are subsequently inoculated with a<br>
spore suspension of the fungus and incubated for one week at high atmospheric humidity<br>
and at approximately 20°C. The fungicidal action of the test substance is deduced from the<br>
number of wounds showing signs of rot.<br>
Active ingredients of the formula I are capable of reducing the spread of rot, in some cases<br>
completely.<br>
Example B-l 1: Action against Helminthosporium gramineum<br>
Wheat grains are contaminated with a spore suspension of the fungus and allowed to dry.<br>
The contaminated grains are dressed with a suspension of the test substance (600 ppm of<br>
active ingredient relative to the weight of the seeds). After two days, the grains are<br>
arranged in suitable dishes containing agar, and, after a further four days, the development<br>
of fungal colonies around the grains is assessed. The test substance is assessed on the basis<br>
of the number and size of the fungal colonies.<br>
A good action, i.e. inhibition of fungal colonies, is shown, in some cases, by compounds<br>
of the formula I.<br>
Example B-12: Action against Colletotrichum lagenarium on cucumbers Cucumber plants are grown for two weeks and then sprayed with a spray mixture (concentration 0.002 %). After 2 days, the plants are inoculated with a spore suspension (1.5 x 105 spores/ml) of the fungus and incubated for 36 hours at 23° and high atmospheric humidity. The incubation is then continued at normal atmospheric humidity at approximately 22-23°C. The fungus infestation which has developed is assessed 8 days after the inoculation. Untreated, but infected, control plants show a fungus infestation of 100 %.<br>
A virtually complete inhibition of the infestation with disease is shown, in some cases, by compounds of the formula I, in particular by No. 1.5 and 3.24.<br>
Example B-l 3: Action against Fusarium nivale on rye<br>
Rye cv. Tetrahell, naturally infected with Fusarium nivale, is dressed with the test fungicide using a mixing roller, the following concentrations being used: 20 or 6 ppm of a.i. (relative to the weight of the seed).<br>
Using a seed drill, the infected and treated rye is drilled in October in a field in 3 m plots of 6 seed furrows. 3 replicates per concentration.<br><br>
Until the infestation is evaluated, the test plants are grown under normal field conditions (preferably in a region with a complete covering of snow during the winter months).<br>
To assess the phytotoxicity, seed emergence is scored in autumn and number of plants per unit area/number of tillers per plant in spring.<br>
To determine the activity of the active ingredient, the percentage of Fusarium-infested plants is counted immediately after the snow has melted. In the present case, the number of infested plants was lower than 5 %. The plants which emerged had a healthy appearance.<br>
Example B-14: Action against Septoria nodorum on wheat<br>
Wheat plants in the 3-leaf stage are sprayed with a spray mixture (60 ppm of a.i.) prepared<br>
with a wettable powder of the active ingredients (2.8:1).<br>
After 24 hours the treated plants are inoculated with a conidia suspension of the fungus. The plants are subsequently incubated for 2 days at a relative atmospheric humidity of 90-100 % and placed in a greenhouse at 20-24°C for a further 10 days. 13 days after the inoculation, the fungus infestation is assessed. Less than 1 % of the wheat plants were infested.<br>
Example B-15: Action against Rhizoctonia solani on rice Protective-local soil application<br>
The soil around 10-day old rice plants was watered with a suspension (spray mixture) prepared with a formulated test substance without aerial parts of the plants coming into contact with the suspension. Three days later, the plants were inoculated by placing a stem of barley straw infected with Rhizoctonia solani between the rice plants of each pot. After incubation for 6 days in a controlled-environment cabinet at 29°C day-time and 26°C night-time temperature and a relative atmospheric humidity of 95 %, the fungus infestation is assessed. Fewer than 5 % of the rice plants are infested. The plants had a healthy appearance.<br>
Protective-local foliar application<br>
12-day old rice plants are sprayed with a suspension prepared with formulated test<br>
substances. One day later, inoculation is carried out by placing a stem of barley straw,<br><br>
infected with Rhizoctonia solani, between the rice plants of each pot. The plants were scored after incubation for 6 days in a controlled-environment cabinet at 29°C day-time and 26°C night-time temperature and a relative atmospheric humidity of 95 %. Untreated, but inoculated, control plants showed a fungal infestation of 100 %. Compounds of the formula I cause in some cases complete inhibition of the infestation with disease.<br>
B. Insecticidal action<br>
Example B-16: Action against Aphis craccivora<br>
Pea seedlings are populated with Aphis craccivora, subsequently sprayed with a spray<br>
mixture comprising 400 ppm of active ingredient and then incubated at 20°. The<br>
percentage reduction in population (% action) is determined after 3 and 6 days by<br>
comparing the number of dead aphids on the treated and the untreated plants.<br>
In this test, compounds of Tables 1-7 have a good action. Compound No. 4.5, isomer 1, in<br>
particular, has an action of over 80 %.<br>
Example B-17: Action against Diabrotica balteata<br>
Maize seedlings are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 400 ppm<br>
of active ingredient, then, after the spray coating has dried on, populated with 10 second<br>
instar larvae of Diabrotica balteata and subsequently placed in a plastic container. The<br>
percentage reduction in population (% action) is determined after 6 days by comparing the<br>
number of dead larvae of the treated and untreated plants.<br>
In this test, compounds of Tables 1-7 have a good action. In particular, compounds No.<br>

400 ppm of active ingredient, then, after the spray coating has dried on, populated with 10<br>
first instar caterpillars of Heliothis virescens and subsequently placed in a plastic<br>
container. The percentage reduction in population and the feeding damage (% action) are<br>
determined after 6 days by comparing the number of dead caterpillars and the feeding<br>
damage of the treated and untreated plants.<br>
In this test, compounds of Tables 1-7 show a good action. In particular, compounds No.<br>
4.5, isomer 1,4.14, isomer 1,4.18, 4.117, both isomers, 4.121, 5.9, isomer 1, and 5.52,<br>
isomer 1, have an action of over 80 %.<br><br>
Example B-19: Action against Spodoptera littoralis<br>
Young soya bean plants are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising<br>
400 ppm of active ingredient, then, after the spray coating has dried on, populated with 10<br>
third instar caterpillars of Spodoptera littoralis and subsequently placed in a plastic<br>
container. The percentage reduction in population and the percentage reduction in feeding<br>
damage (% action) are determined after 3 days by comparing the number of dead<br>
caterpillars and the feeding damage of the treated and untreated plants.<br>
In this test, compounds of Tables 1-7 show a good action. In particular, compounds No.<br>
1.5, 1.24. 2.24, 3.24, 4.18, 4.5, isomer 1, 5.9, isomer 1, and 5.52, isomer 1, have an action<br>
of over 80 %.<br>
C. Acaricidal activity<br>
Example B-2Q: Action against Tetranvchus urticae<br>
Young bean plants are populated with a mixed population of Tetranychus urticae, then, 1<br>
day later, sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 400 ppm of active<br>
ingredient, incubated for 6 days at 25° and subsequently evaluated. The percentage<br>
reduction in population (% action) is determined by comparing the number of dead eggs,<br>
larvae and adults on the treated and untreated plants.<br>
In this test, compounds of Tables 1-6 show a good action. In particular, compounds No.<br>
1.5, 1.24, 2.24 und 3.24, 4.5, isomer 1, 4.14, isomer 1, 4.117, both isomers, 5.9, isomer 1,<br>
and 5.52, isomer 1, have an action of over 80 %.<br>
Example B-21: Action against Boophilus microplus<br>
Adult female ticks which have sucked themselves full are attached to a PVC board and covered with a cottonwool ball, and 10 ml of aqueous test solution comprising 125 ppm of active ingredient are poured over the ticks. The cottonwool ball is removed, and the ticks are incubated for 4 weeks for oviposition. The action becomes apparent either, in the case of the female, in the form of mortality or sterility or, in the case of the eggs, in the form of an ovicidal action.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
