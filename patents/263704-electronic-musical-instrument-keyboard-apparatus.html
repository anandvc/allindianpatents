				<td>ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT KEYBOARD APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates generally to keyboard apparatus for<br>
electronic musical instruments, such as electronic organs and electronic<br>
pianos.<br>
With acoustic pianos, there is produced a key touch feeling called<br>
"let-off feeing" that, when a key has been depressed (i.e., static load has<br>
been applied to the key), the key touch temporarily becomes heavy (i.e.,<br>
reactive force to the depressed key increases) partway through the key<br>
depression and then rapidly becomes light (i.e., the reactive force to the<br>
depressed key decreases) as the key is further depressed. Various schemes<br>
have been proposed to allow an electronic musical instrument keyboard<br>
apparatus to emulate such a let-off feeling. Japanese Patent No. 3458400,<br>
for example, discloses an electronic musical instrument keyboard<br>
apparatus, which includes hammers each not only pivoting in interlocked<br>
relation to movement of a corresponding key but also giving a feeling of<br>
mass during the key depression, and in which the rear end of the hammer<br>
contacts a roller that is supported by a resilient member. Immediately<br>
before the end of the key depression, the rear end of the hammer engages<br>
(or contacts) with the roller so that the reactive force to the depressed key<br>
increases by resistance of the resilient member. Upon end of the key<br>
depression, the rear end of the hammer disengages from the roller so that<br>
the reactive force to the depressed key rapidly decreases. In the<br>
aforementioned manner, a let-off feeling can be emulated.<br>
In the aforementioned conventional keyboard apparatus, there can be<br>
achieved a left"off feeling, but, even at the time of key release, the reactive<br>
force to the depressed key would increase due to the engagement (or<br>
contact) between the hammer and the roller. Such increase of the<br><br>
reactive force at the time of the key release would retard a returning<br>
velocity of the key and thus adversely influence a successive key depression<br>
performance of the keyboard apparatus.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide an improved electronic musical instrument keyboard apparatus<br>
capable of achieving a let'off feeling while at the same time securing a good<br>
successive key depression performance.<br>
In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, the present<br>
invention provides an improved electronic musical instrument keyboard<br>
apparatus, which comprises: a depressable and releasable key; a key frame<br>
disposed beneath the key for supporting the key in such a manner that the<br>
key is pivotable with a front end of the key swinging vertically; a key<br>
urging mechanism assembled to the key frame for normally urging<br>
upwardly the front end of the key and limiting the front end to a<br>
predetermined height position; a movable (displaceable) member provided<br>
in the key urging mechanism and movable in interlocked relation to the<br>
key; a load member that imparts a load to pivoting movement of said key<br>
via the movable member; an actuator that drives the load member,' a key<br>
position detection section that detects a pivoting position of the key<br>
responsive to depression and release operation of the key,' and a load<br>
control section that performs driving control on the actuator in accordance<br>
with the pivoting position of the key detected by the key position detection<br>
section to impart a load to the pivoting movement of the key, in accordance<br>
with the detected pivoting position of the key, in such a manner that the<br>
load to be imparted by the load member in a depression stroke of the key is<br>
greater than the load to be imparted by the load member in a release stroke<br>
of the key.<br>
In this case, the movable member may be in the form of a mass body<br><br>
having an elongated shape, movable in interlocked relation to the pivoting<br>
movement of the key and normally urging the front end of the key upwardly,<br>
and the load control section may cause the load member to engage (or<br>
contact) with the mass body in the depression stroke and terminates the<br>
engagement (or contact) of the load member with the mass body in the<br>
release stroke. Further, the actuator may be, for example, in the form of<br>
an electric actuator employing a super magnetostrictive device not only<br>
capable of providing a relatively great driving force with a low voltage but<br>
also having a quick response speed.<br>
With the load control section performing driving control on the<br>
actuator, in accordance with the pivoting position of the key detected by the<br>
key position detection section, and changing the state of engagement of the<br>
load member with the movable member, in accordance with the detected<br>
pivoting position of the key, in such a manner that the load to be imparted<br>
in the depression stroke of the key is greater than the load to be imparted<br>
in the release stroke of the key, the present invention can increase a<br>
reactive force to depression of the key and decrease the reactive force<br>
during release of the key. As a result, the present invention can achieve<br>
not only a let-off feeling but also a good successive key depression<br>
performance.<br>
The movable member and load member employed in the<br>
aforementioned invention may be replaced with a load member engageable<br>
with the key to impart a load to the pivoting movement of the key, and the<br>
load control section may perform driving control on the actuator in<br>
accordance with the pivoting position of the key detected by the key<br>
position detection section to change the state of engagement of the load<br>
member with the key, in accordance with the detected pivoting position of<br>
the key, in such a manner that the load to be imparted by the load member<br>
in the depression stroke of the key is greater than the load to be imparted<br>
by the load member in the release stroke of the key. In this case, the load<br><br>
control section may cause the load member to engage with the key in the<br>
depression stroke and terminate the engagement of the load member with<br>
the key in the release stroke. With such arrangements too, the present<br>
invention can increase the reactive force to depression of the key and<br>
decrease the reactive force during release of the key. As a result, the<br>
present invention can achieve not only a let-off feeling but also a good<br>
successive key depression performance.<br>
The electronic musical instrument keyboard apparatus of the present<br>
invention may further comprise a depressing velocity detection section that<br>
detects a depressing velocity of the key, in which case the load control<br>
section may perform driving control on the actuator so that the force of the<br>
engagement of the load member or key with the movable member decreases<br>
as the detected depressing velocity increases. With such arrangements,<br>
the present invention can give a human player a massive key touch feeling<br>
in response to slow key depression and a light key touch feeling in response<br>
to rapid key depression. As a result, the key touch feeling can be even<br>
further improved.<br>
The electronic musical instrument keyboard apparatus of the present<br>
invention may also be constructed so that the force of the engagement of<br>
the load member with the movable member or key decreases as the tone<br>
pitch corresponding to the key increases. In this case, the driving force to<br>
be applied to the actuator by the load control section may be set at different<br>
values in advance on a key-by key or key-range-bykeyrange basis, or the<br>
force of the engagement of the load member with the movable member or<br>
key may be set at different values in advance on the key-bykey or<br>
key range-by key range basis. With such arrangements, the present<br>
invention can give the human player a massive key touch feeling in<br>
response to depression of a key in a low-pitch key range and a light key<br>
touch feeling in response to depression of a key in a high-pitch key range.<br>
As a result, the key touch feeling can be even further improved.<br><br>
The following will describe embodiments of the present invention, but<br>
it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the<br>
described embodiments and various modifications of the invention are<br>
possible without departing from the basic principles. The scope of the<br>
present invention is therefore to be determined solely by the appended<br>
claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
a. First Embodiment:<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view showing an electronic musical instrument and a<br>
keyboard apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention employed in the electronic musical instrument. The electronic<br>
musical instrument includes a plurality of panel switchers PSW for<br>
selecting a desired operation style. The electronic musical instrument<br>
includes, on an upper front surface portion thereof, a keyboard apparatus<br>
having a plurality of white keys 10 and black keys 10 arranged in a<br>
horizontal left-right direction of the musical instrument.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B are vertical sectional views of the keyboard<br>
apparatus. More specifically, Fig. 2A shows a state where all of the keys<br>
10 are in a released or non-depressed position, and Fig. 2B shows a state<br>
where one of the keys 10 is in a depressed position. The plurality of keys<br>
10 are assembled to a key frame 20 formed integrally of synthetic resin,<br>
and the key frame 20 is fixed to and located over a support table 30. A<br>
plurality of pivot levels 40, constituting key biasing mechanisms<br><br>
corresponding to the keys 10, are assembled to the key frame 20 under the<br>
corresponding keys 10.<br>
Each of the keys 10 is integrally formed of synthetic resin into a<br>
downwardly-opening U or channel sectional shape. Rear end portion 11 of<br>
each of the keys 10 is pivotably fitted in a forwardly-opening recess formed<br>
in a rear end portion 21 of the key frame 20. Each of the keys 10 is<br>
pivotably supported on the key frame 20 in such a manner that its front<br>
end portion 12 can vertically swing with side surfaces of the rear end<br>
portion 11 as a pivot point. Key guide 22 projecting upward from a<br>
front-end horizontal portion of the key frame 20 enters the front end<br>
portion 12 of the key 10 from below. During depression of the key, the<br>
front end portion 12 of the key 10 is displaced vertically while being guided<br>
by the key guide 22. Driving portion 13 is formed integrally with the<br>
underside of a front region near the front end portion 12 of the key 10 and<br>
extends vertically downward from the underside. The driving portion 13<br>
has a U or channel horizontal sectional shape opening rearwardly and has<br>
a closed lower end.<br>
The pivot lever 40 comprises a resin-made lever base section 41 and a<br>
metal-made mass body 42 as a movable or displaceable member. The lever<br>
base section 41, which is molded into an elongated and flat plate shape,<br>
extends in a front-rear-direction of the keyboard apparatus and is located<br>
under a front portion of the corresponding key 10 with its plate surface<br>
oriented generally vertically. The lever base section 41 has a recessed<br>
portion 41a formed in the lower surface of its longitudinally-middle region<br>
and having an axis line lying in the horizontal left-right direction (or<br>
key-arranged direction) of the keyboard, and the recessed portion 41a has a<br>
greater thickness in the axial direction. The recessed portion 41a opens<br>
obliquely forwardly and downwardly and engages with a pivot support<br>
portion 23a that is provided at the upper end of a slanting plate 23<br>
extending obliquely rearwardly and upwardly from a front lower end<br><br>
position of the key frame 20. The pivot support portion 23a extends in the<br>
horizontal left-right direction (i.e., key-arranged direction) of the keyboard.<br>
The lever base section 41 is normally urged forward by a leaf spring 43 that<br>
constitutes a key urging mechanism supported on the rear end portion 11 of<br>
the key 10. In this manner, the pivot lever 40 is vertically pivotably<br>
supported on the key frame 20.<br>
Front end portion of the lever base section 41 is vertically bifurcated<br>
into a pair of upper and lower leg portions 41b and 41c vertically spaced<br>
from each other by a predetermined space, and the upper leg portion 41b<br>
has a smaller length than the lower leg portion 41c. Lower end wall<br>
portion of the driving portion 13 of the key 10 is located between and<br>
engages with the upper and lower leg portions 41b and 41c. Thus, as the<br>
key 10 is released from the depressed position, a front end portion of the<br>
pivot lever 40 is displaced upward due to the weight of the lever 40, so that<br>
a front end portion of the key 10 too is displaced upward. On the other<br>
hand, as the key 10 is depressed, the lower end surface of the lower end<br>
wall portion of the driving portion 13 presses the upper surface of the lower<br>
leg portion 41c, so that the front end portion of the pivot lever 40 is<br>
displaced downward.<br>
Downwardly-projecting switch driving portion 41d is formed on the<br>
underside of the lever base section 41 between the recessed portion 41a and<br>
the upper leg portion 41b. The switch driving portion 41d is opposed to a<br>
key switch 52 provided on a printed circuit board 52 via a window 23b<br>
formed through the slanting plate 23, and this key switch 52 constitutes a<br>
key position detection means. Such key switches 52 are provided in<br>
corresponding relation to the keys 10 and arranged in the horizontal<br>
left-right direction (i.e., key-arranged direction) of the keyboard.<br>
As shown in enlarged scale in Fig. 3, each of the key switches 52<br>
comprises first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c arrayed in the front-rear<br>
direction of the keyboard. The first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c,<br><br>
each of which is formed into a semispherical shape (or bowl shape) having<br>
an inner space, are provide on a switch member formed of a resilient<br>
substance, such as rubber or silicon, elongated in the left-right direction of<br>
the keyboard. Further, each of the first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c<br>
has a cylindrical columnar portion formed integrally on, and extending<br>
downward from, a central inner surface portion thereof. Electric contact is<br>
provided on the lower end surface of the downwardly-projecting cylindrical<br>
columnar portion of each of the first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c, and<br>
each of the electric contacts is opposed to two electric contacts provided on<br>
the printed circuit board 51 in corresponding relation to thereto. As the<br>
switch driving portion 41d moves downward in response to depression<br>
operation of the key 10, the first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c are<br>
brought into contact with (or turn on) the corresponding electric contacts on<br>
the printed circuit board 51. Further, the cylindrical columnar portions of<br>
the first to third switches 52a, 52b and 52c have different lengths that<br>
become sequentially smaller in the order of mentioning. As the key 10 is<br>
depressed, the first, second and third switches 52a, 52b and 52c<br>
sequentially turn ON in the order of mentioning. As the key 10 is released,<br>
the third, second and first switches 52c, 52b and 52a turn OFF in the order<br>
of mentioning.<br>
The mass body 42 of the pivot lever 40 is in the form of a rod, which is<br>
assembled integrally to the lever base section 41 by outsert-molding the<br>
lever base section 41 onto a front outer peripheral portion of the pivot lever<br>
40. The mass body 42 has a rear folded-back portion 42a. The<br>
folded-back portion 42a differs in length among the mass bodies 42<br>
corresponding to the plurality of keys 10, so that the mass bodies 42 differ<br>
in weight from one another. More specifically, for both the white keys 10<br>
and the black keys 10, the folded-back portions 42a have lengths that<br>
gradually decrease, on a keyby-key or keyrange-bykeyrange basis, in a<br>
direction from the lowest-pitch key to the highest-pitch key, so that the<br><br>
mass bodies 42 for the keys of lower pitches or pitch ranges have greater<br>
weights, i.e. greater rotational moments. Further, for each pair of<br>
adjoining white and black keys 10, the length of the folded-back portion 42a<br>
of the black key 10 is set smaller than that of the white key 10 to avoid a<br>
difference that would occur in reactive force to key depression due to a<br>
difference in key depression position.<br>
Further, an elongated lower limit stopper 53 made of an impact<br>
absorbing substance, such as felt, is secured to the upper surface of the<br>
support table 30 located on a rear end portion of the key frame 20, and the<br>
lower-limit stopper 53 extends in the horizontal left-right direction of the<br>
keyboard. The lower limit stopper 53 functions to limit downward<br>
displacement or movement of a rear end portion of the pivot lever 40, to<br>
thereby limit upward displacement of a front end portion of the key 10<br>
when the key 10 is released from the depressed position. Further, an<br>
elongated upper limit stopper 54 made of an impact absorbing substance,<br>
such as felt, is secured to the lower surface of an upper surface plate 24<br>
located on a rear end portion of the key frame 20. The upper limit stopper<br>
54 is vertically spaced apart from the lower limit stopper 53 by a<br>
predetermined distance and extends in the left-right direction of the<br>
keyboard. The upper limit stopper 54 functions to limit upward<br>
displacement of the rear end portion of the pivot lever 40, to thereby limit<br>
downward displacement of the front end portion of the key 10 when the key<br>
10 is depressed. The lower limit stopper 53 and upper limit stopper 54<br>
both constitute the key urging mechanism. Proximity sensor (proximity<br>
switch) 55 is provided forwardly of the upper limit stopper 54 and in<br>
opposed relation to the mass body 42. The proximity sensor 55 is a sensor<br>
for detecting when the mass body 42 is in abutting contact with or located<br>
proximal to the upper limit stopper 54, using electromagnetic induction,<br>
electrostatic capacitance, ultrasonic sound wave, photo-electric effect,<br>
magnetic change, or the like. The proximity sensor 55 constitutes a key<br><br>
position detection means.<br>
Driving unit 60 is assembled to the key frame 20 behind the keys 10.<br>
The driving unit 60 includes a support plate 61 bent into a generally<br>
hook-like shape and fixed to the key frame 20. Actuators 63,<br>
accommodated in a case 62 fixed to the support plate 61, are secured to the<br>
support plate 61 in corresponding relation to the keys 10. Driving rod 63a<br>
is normally urged leftward by a built-in spring. Each of the actuator 63,<br>
which is controlled electrically, displaces, by application of a voltage, the<br>
driving rod 63a in a rightward direction in the figure, to reciprocate a load<br>
member 64 fixed to the distal end of the driving rod 63a. The actuator 63<br>
is preferably in the form of an electric actuator employing a super<br>
magnetostrictive device not only capable of providing a relatively great<br>
driving force with a low voltage but also having a quick response speed,<br>
although various other types of actuators, such as an electromagnetic<br>
solenoid, may be used as long as driving of the actuator can be electrically<br>
controlled. The load member 64 is molded of a resilient substance into a<br>
generally cylindrical columnar shape with a semispherical distal end.<br>
When the load member 64 is in a leftward projecting position as shown Fig.<br>
2A, it engages (or contacts) with a rear end portion of the mass body 42,<br>
functioning as the movable or displaceable member, to impart a load to the<br>
pivoting movement of the mass body 42 and hence the key 10. This load<br>
can be adjusted by adjustment of any of the projecting amount, shape,<br>
substance, etc. of the load member 64.<br>
The key switches 52 and proximity sensors 55 provided in<br>
corresponding relation to the keys 10 are connected to a load control circuit<br>
70. The load control circuit 70 electrically controls the driving of each of<br>
the actuators 63 to cause the load member 64 to engage (or contact) with<br>
the mass body 42 as the displaceable member, to thereby impart a load to<br>
the pivoting movement of the key 10. The load control circuit 70 includes<br>
a microcomputer comprising a CPU, ROM, RAM, etc., and a drive circuit<br><br>
for outputting a driving signal to each of the actuators 63 in accordance<br>
with an instruction given by the microcomputer. More specifically, the<br>
load control circuit 70 is responsive to detection, by the proximity sensor 55,<br>
of proximity of the mass body 42 to output a driving voltage to the actuator<br>
63 corresponding to the detected mass body 42 and then pull or retract the<br>
driving rod 63a in the rightward direction of the figure against the biasing<br>
force of the spring. Further, the load control circuit 70 detects a change<br>
from an ON state to an OFF state of the first switch 52a, in response to<br>
which it cancels or terminates the driving force to the actuator 63<br>
corresponding to the detected first switch 52a to thereby cause the driving<br>
rod 63a to project in the leftward direction of the figure by the biasing force<br>
of the spring.<br>
Signals from the first to third switches 52a — 52c of each of the key<br>
switches 52 corresponding to the keys 10 are also supplied to a not-shown<br>
tone signal generation circuit. Upon detection of a change from the OFF<br>
state to the ON state of the third switch 52c, the tone signal generation<br>
circuit starts generating a tone signal of a tone pitch corresponding to the<br>
third switch 52c having changed to the ON state. Further, upon detection<br>
of a change from the ON state to the OFF state of the first switch 52a, the<br>
tone signal generation circuit starts attenuating the tone signal of the tone<br>
pitch corresponding to the first switch 52a having changed to the OFF state,<br>
and then ends the generation of the tone signal. Furthermore, the tone<br>
signal generation circuit inputs tone signals from the first and second<br>
switches 52a and 52b of each of the key switches 52 corresponding to the<br>
keys 10 and a key depressing velocity per key by measuring a length of<br>
time from a time point when the first switch 52a changes from the ON<br>
state to the OFF state to a time point when the second switch 52b changes<br>
from the OFF state to the ON state. The thus-detected key depressing<br>
velocity is used to control a tone volume and color of a tone signal to be<br>
generated.<br><br>
Next, a description will be given about behavior of the keyboard<br>
apparatus constructed as above according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. For each key 10 which is not being depressed (i.e., is in<br>
the non-depressed position), the rear end portion of the mass body 42 of the<br>
corresponding pivot lever 40 is in abutment against the lower limit stopper<br>
53 by its own weight. Once the key 10 is depressed by a human player in<br>
this state, the key 10 starts pivoting in a counterclockwise direction of Fig.<br>
2A about the rear end portion 11 against the weight of the mass body 42 of<br>
the pivot lever 40. Once the key 10 is depressed to a predetermined depth,<br>
the rear end portion of the mass body 42 abuts against the upper limit<br>
stopper 54 as shown in Fig. 2B, so that further downward displacement of<br>
the front end portion of the key 10 is prevented. At that time, as the pivot<br>
lever 40 pivots, the downwardly-extending switch driving portion 41d<br>
presses the key switch 52, so that the first, second and third switches 52a,<br>
52b and 52c sequentially turn on the order of mentioning. Then, once the<br>
key 10 is released, the pivot lever 40 pivots in a clockwise direction of Fig.<br>
2B about the pivot support portion 23a because of the weight of the mass<br>
body 42 of the pivot lever 40 until the rear end portion of the mass body 42<br>
abuts against the lower limit stopper 53, so that the mass body 42 returns<br>
to its original position. The tone signal generation circuit controls the<br>
tone volume and color of a tone signal to be generated, in accordance with<br>
the detected key depressing velocity.<br>
During such depression/release operation of the key 10, the load<br>
control circuit 70 performs control on the actuator 63 in accordance with<br>
the pivoting movement of the mass body 42, i.e. pivoting position of the key<br>
10. When the first switch 52a of the key switch 52 is in the OFF state, the<br>
load control circuit 70 imparts no driving force to the actuator 63. In this<br>
state, the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63 is kept in the leftward<br>
projecting position as shown in Fig. 4A. As the key 10 and pivot lever 40<br>
pivot in response to key depression operation so that the rear end portion of<br><br>
the mass body 42 is displaced upward as shown in Figs. 4B and 4D, the<br>
rear end portion of the mass body 42 contacts a front end portion of the<br>
load member 64 to deform the load member 64. Then, as the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 further moves upward, it gets over the front<br>
end portion of the load member 64 as shown in Fig. 4E. In this case, a<br>
force by the engagement (or contact) between the rear end portion of the<br>
mass body 42 and the load member 64, i.e. reactive force (resilient force)<br>
resultant from the deformation of the front end portion of the load member<br>
64, acts as a load to the key depression operation by the human player.<br>
This load acts in such a manner that the key touch temporarily becomes<br>
heavy (i.e., reactive force to the depressed key increases). Then, as the key<br>
is further depressed, the engagement (or contact) between the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 and the load member 64 is canceled and the<br>
load member 64 rapidly becomes light (i.e., the reactive force to the<br>
depressed key decreases), so that the human player can enjoy a let-off<br>
feeling.<br>
As the key is depressed even further, the upper surface of the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 abuts against the upper limit stopper 54, so<br>
that the pivot lever 40 stops pivoting. Immediately before the end of the<br>
pivoting movement of the pivot lever 40, the third switch 52c of the key<br>
switch 52 changes from the OFF state to the ON state, so that generation<br>
of the tone signal is started. The first and second switches 52a and 52b of<br>
the key switch 52 both change from the OFF state to the ON state by the<br>
time the rear end portion of the mass body 42 abuts against the load<br>
member 64.<br>
When the upper surface of the rear end portion of the mass body 42<br>
has abutted against the upper limit stopper 54, the proximity sensor 55<br>
detects proximity of the mass body 42, and the load control circuit 70<br>
energizes and drives the actuator 63. Thus, the actuator 63 retracts the<br>
driving rod 63a in the rightward direction as shown in Fig. 4F against the<br><br>
biasing force of the spring. Then, once the depressed key 10 is released in<br>
the above-mentioned state, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 is<br>
displaced downward, as shown in Fig. 4F to Figs. 4G and 4H, as the key 10<br>
and pivot lever 40 pivot upward. Because the load member 64 has been<br>
retracted rightward, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 moves<br>
downward without contacting the front end portion of the load member 64.<br>
Then, the lower surface of the rear end portion of the mass body 42 abuts<br>
against the lower limit stopper 53, so that the key 10 and pivot lever 40<br>
stop pivoting upward. In such a release stroke of the key 10, no load is<br>
imparted from the load member 64 to the pivoting movement of the key 10<br>
and pivot lever 40 because the front end portion of the load member 64 does<br>
not engage (or contact) with the load member 64. Thus, a velocity at<br>
which the key 10 returns to the original position can be accelerated, with<br>
the result that operation for successively depressing the key 10 can be<br>
performed appropriately as desired; namely, successive depression<br>
performance of the key 10 can be effectively enhanced.<br>
Immediately before the lower surface of the rear end portion of the<br>
mass body 42 abuts against the lower limit stopper 53 as noted above, the<br>
first switch 52a of the key switch 52 changes from the ON state to the OFF<br>
state. In response to the ON-to-OFF state change of the first switch 52a,<br>
the load control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator 63. Thus,<br>
as shown in Figs. 4I and 4A, the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63 again<br>
projects leftward by virtue of the biasing force of the spring. Then, the<br>
aforementioned behavior is repeated once the key 10 is again depressed<br>
and released by the human player.<br>
If the same key 10 has been again depressed during the release stroke<br>
before the first switch 52a changes from the ON state to the OFF state, i.e.<br>
the same key 10 has been depressed successively more rapidly than in the<br>
aforementioned successive depression, the driving rod 63a is kept by the<br>
actuator 63 in the rightward retracted position as shown in Fig. 4H. Thus,<br><br>
during the upward displacement of the mass body 42 caused by the key<br>
depression operation, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 moves<br>
downward without contacting the load member 64, and thus, no load is<br>
imparted from the load member 64 to the pivoting movement of the key 10<br>
 and pivot lever 40. Therefore, during the rapid successive depression<br>
operation of the key 10, the load member 64 does not engage (or contact)<br>
with the rear end portion of the mass body 42 in the key depression stroke<br>
too. Consequently, during the rapid successive depression operation of the<br>
key 10, the human player can perform depression and release operation of<br>
 the key 10 as desired with no load applied from the load member 64 to the<br>
key 10, which can significantly facilitate a performance involving rapid<br>
successive depression operation of the key 10.<br>
In the first embodiment, as set forth above, the driving rod 63a of the<br>
actuator 63 is normally urged by the spring in the leftward projecting<br>
i position so that, in the release stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
driven to retract the driving rod 63a rightward against the biasing force of<br>
the spring. In a modification, however, the driving rod 63a of the actuator<br>
63 may be normally urged by the spring to in a rightward projecting<br>
position so that, in the depression stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
 driven to retract the driving rod 63a leftward to cause the rear end portion<br>
of the mass body 42 and the load member 64 to engage (or contact) with<br>
each other. In such a case, the load control circuit 70 drives the actuator<br>
63 to cause the driving rod 63a to project leftward when the first switch 52a<br>
of the key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON state,<br>
taking electric power consumption into account. Then, once the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 reaches the predetermined position proximal to<br>
the upper limit stopper 54, the load control circuit 70 terminates the<br>
driving of the actuator 63 so as to retract the driving rod 63a rightward by<br>
the biasing force of the spring.<br>
In the aforementioned modification of the first embodiment too, a<br><br>
left-off feeling can be given, during the depression stroke of the key 10, to<br>
the key depression operation of the human player by the load member 64<br>
engaging with the rear end portion of the mass body 42. Further, during<br>
the release stroke of the key 10, the load member 64 is disengaged from the<br>
rear end portion of the mass body 42 so that the returning velocity of the<br>
key 10 can be accelerated and thus a good successive depression<br>
performance can be maintained as desired. Furthermore, in this<br>
modification too, if the same key 10 has been again depressed before the<br>
first switch 52a changes from the ON state to the OFF state, i.e. the same<br>
key 10 has been depressed successively more rapidly than in the<br>
aforementioned successive depression, the driving rod 63a of the actuator<br>
63 can continue to be is kept by the spring in the rightward retracted<br>
position. Namely, in this case, the load control circuit 70 does not detect a<br>
change from the OFF state to the ON state of the first switch 52a and does<br>
not drive the actuator 63. Thus, in this modification too, during the rapid<br>
successive depression operation of the key 10, the load member 64 does not<br>
engage (or contact) with the rear end portion of the mass body 42 in the key<br>
depression stroke too, and thus, a performance involving rapid successive<br>
depression operation of the key 10 can be executed with ease,<br>
b. Second Embodiment:<br>
Next, a description will be given about the electronic musical<br>
instrument keyboard apparatus according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, which employs a modified load mechanism for giving a<br>
load to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40. Fig. 5 is a<br>
vertical sectional view of the electronic musical instrument keyboard<br>
apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
This keyboard apparatus includes a load member 65 that is driven by the<br>
driving unit 60 to give a load to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and<br>
pivot lever 40. The load member 65 is formed integrally of synthetic resin<br>
into a hook-like or L shape having vertical and horizontal portions 65a and<br><br>
65b extending substantially at right angles to each other. The load<br>
member 65 is rotatably supported at an intermediate region of the vertical<br>
portion 65a on a support section 66, fixed to the support table 30, via a pin<br>
66a. The horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65 has a distant end<br>
portion projecting into an upper area where the front end portion of the<br>
mass member 42 passes. Only a front end portion of the horizontal<br>
portion 65b or the whole of the load member 65 may be formed of a resilient<br>
substance. The load member 65 is normally urged in a counterclockwise<br>
direction in the figure by a built-in weight or spring (not shown). Pressing<br>
member 63b fixed to the distal end of the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63<br>
is held in abutment against the rear surface of a lower end portion of the<br>
vertical portion 65a of the load member 65. The pressing member 63b is<br>
formed of resin integrally with the driving rod 63a and has a distal end<br>
portion formed into a semispherical shape. The pressing member 63b may<br>
be formed of an elastic substance, such as rubber or elastomer, into a<br>
cylindrical columnar shape with a semispherical distal end.<br>
The actuator 63 in the second embodiment is constructed similarly to<br>
the actuator 63 in the first embodiment, but, in the second embodiment,<br>
the driving rod 63a in this actuator 63 is normally urged by the built-in<br>
spring in a leftward retracted position. In this state, the rear end of the<br>
mass body 42 contacts (i.e., engages with) the front end of the horizontal<br>
portion 65b of the load member 65 as the mass body 42 is displaced<br>
between the lower limit stopper 53 and the upper limit stopper 54 by the<br>
pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40. Once the actuator 63<br>
is driven via the load control circuit 70, it causes the driving rod 63a to<br>
project in the leftward direction of the figure. Thus, the load member 65<br>
pivots in the clockwise direction, so that the distal end portion of the<br>
horizontal portion 65b is displaced rearward. In this state, the rear end of<br>
the mass body 42 does not contact (i.e., does not engage with) the front end<br>
of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65 even if the mass body<br><br>
42 is displaced between the lower limit stopper 53 and the upper limit<br>
stopper 54 by the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40. The<br>
actuator 63 is accommodated in the case 62 as in the above-described first<br>
embodiment, and the case 62 is fixed to the support table 30.<br>
	The load control circuit 70 starts driving the actuator 63 when the<br>
proximity sensor 55 has detected proximity of the mass body 42, and<br>
terminates the driving of the actuator 63 when the first switch 52a of the<br>
key switch 52 has changed from the ON state to the OFF state. The other<br>
structural arrangements of the second embodiment are similar to those of<br>
 the first embodiment. Note that, in the second embodiment, the intensity<br>
of the load to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40 is<br>
adjustable by adjusting any of the rotational amount, shape, substance, etc.<br>
of the load member 65.<br>
Next, a description will be given about behavior of the keyboard<br>
apparatus constructed as above according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Tone signal generation and termination of the tone<br>
signal generation responsive to depression/release operation of the key 10<br>
is similar to that in the above-described first embodiment. In the second<br>
embodiment, during depression/release operation of the key 10, the load<br>
member 65 pivots about the pin 66a in response to the pivoting movement<br>
of the pivot lever 40 and driving of the actuator 63. When the key 10 is in<br>
the released position and the rear end portion of the mass body 42 is<br>
located over the lower limit stopper 53, the actuator 63 is in the non-driven<br>
state, so that the driving rod 53 is kept in the rightward retracted position,<br>
the pressing member 63b is kept in abutment against the rear surface of<br>
the lower end portion of the vertical portion 65a of the load member 65, and<br>
the front end of the horizontal portion 65b is kept in the forward (leftward<br>
in the figure) projecting position. When the key 10 is depressed in such a<br>
state, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 is displaced upward by the<br>
pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40 as shown in Fig. 6B, so<br><br>
that the rear end portion of the mass body 42 engages (or contacts) with the<br>
front end portion of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65 and<br>
the load member 65 pivots in the clockwise direction against the biasing<br>
force of the weight or spring.<br>
Then, as the rear end portion of the mass body 42 further moves<br>
upward, it gets over the front end portion of the horizontal portion 65b of<br>
the load member 65 and abuts against the upper limit stopper 54, as shown<br>
in Fig. 6C. Once the rear end portion of the mass body 42 gets over the<br>
front end portion of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65, the<br>
load member 65 returns to the original position (i.e., position shown in Fig.<br>
6A) by virtue of the biasing force of the weight or spring. While the rear<br>
end portion of the mass body 42 is in engagement with the front end<br>
portion of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65, a force causing<br>
the load member 65 to pivot in the clockwise direction serves as a load to<br>
key depression operation of the human player during the depression stroke.<br>
Further, if the distal end of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member<br>
65 or the whole of the load member 65 is formed of an elastic substance, a<br>
force caused by deformation of the elastic substance as well as the force<br>
causing the load member 65 to pivot in the clockwise direction serves as a<br>
load to key depression operation of the human player. Such a load acts in<br>
such a manner that the key touch temporarily becomes heavy (i.e., reactive<br>
force to the depressed key increases) partway through the key depression.<br>
Then, as the key is further depressed, the engagement between the rear<br>
end portion of the mass body 42 and the horizontal portion 65b of the load<br>
member 65 is canceled and the key touch rapidly becomes light (i.e., the<br>
reactive force to the depressed key rapidly decreases), so that the human<br>
player can enjoy a let-off feeling.<br>
When the upper surface of the rear end portion of the mass body 42<br>
has abutted against the upper limit stopper 54, the proximity sensor 55<br>
detects proximity of the mass body 42, and the load control circuit 70<br><br>
energizes and drives the actuator 63. The actuator 63 causes the driving<br>
rod 63a to project in the leftward direction as shown in Fig. 6C against the<br>
biasing force of the spring. Thus, the load member 65 pivots in the<br>
clockwise direction so that the front end of the horizontal portion 65b of the<br>
 load member 65 moves rightward. Then, once the depressed key 10 is<br>
released in this state, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 is displaced<br>
downward as the key 10 and pivot lever 40 pivot upward. Because the<br>
front end of the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65 has been<br>
retracted rightward, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 moves<br>
 downward without contacting the front end portion of the load member's<br>
horizontal portion 65b. Then, the lower surface of the rear end portion of<br>
the mass body 42 abuts against the lower limit stopper 53, so that the key<br>
10 and pivot lever 40 stop pivoting upward as shown in Fig. 6A. During<br>
the release stroke of the key 10, no load is imparted from the load member<br>
65 to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40 because the<br>
rear end portion of the mass body 42 does not engage (or contact) with the<br>
horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65. Thus, the velocity at which<br>
the key 10 returns to the original position can be accelerated, with the<br>
result that operation for successively depressing the key 10 can be<br>
performed more appropriately; namely, the successive depression<br>
performance of the key 10 can be effectively enhanced.<br>
Immediately before the lower surface of the rear end portion of the<br>
mass body 42 abuts against the lower limit stopper 53 as noted above, the<br>
first switch 52a of the key switch 52 changes from the ON state to the OFF<br>
state. In response to the ON-to-OFF state change of the first switch 52a,<br>
the load control circuit 7€ terminates the driving of the actuator 63. Thus,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6A, the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63 is again<br>
retracted rightward. Then, the aforementioned behavior is repeated once<br>
the key 10 is again depressed and released by the human player.<br>
If the same key 10 has been again depressed before the first switch<br><br>
52a changes from the ON state to the OFF state, i.e. the same key 10 has<br>
been depressed successively more rapidly than in the aforementioned<br>
successive depression, the driving rod 63a is kept by the actuator 63 in the<br>
leftward projecting position as shown in Fig. 6C. Thus, during the upward<br>
displacement of the rear end portion of the mass body 42 caused by the key<br>
depression operation, the rear end portion of the mass body 42 moves<br>
without contacting the horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65, and<br>
thus, no load is imparted from the load member 65 to the pivoting<br>
movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40. Therefore, during the rapid<br>
successive depression operation of the key 10, the load member 65 does not<br>
engage (or contact) with the rear end portion of the mass body 42 in the key<br>
depression stroke too. Consequently, during the rapid successive<br>
depression operation of the key 10, the human player can perform<br>
depression and release operation of the key 10 with no load applied from<br>
the load member 65 to the key 10, which can facilitate a performance<br>
involving rapid successive depression operation of the key 10.<br>
In the second embodiment, as set forth above, the driving rod 63a of<br>
the actuator 63 is normally urged by the spring in the rightward retracted<br>
position so that, in the release stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
driven to cause the driving rod 63a to project leftward against the biasing<br>
force of the spring. In a modification, however, the driving rod 63a of the<br>
actuator 63 may be normally urged by the spring in a leftward projecting<br>
position so that, in the depression stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
driven to retract the driving rod 63a rightward to cause the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 and the horizontal portion 65b of the load<br>
member 65 to engage (or contact) with each other. In such a case, the load<br>
control circuit 70 drives the actuator 63 to cause the driving rod 63a to<br>
project rightward when the first switch 52a of the key switch 52 has<br>
changed from the OFF state to the ON state, taking electric power<br>
consumption into account. Then, once the rear end portion of the mass<br><br>
body 42 reaches the predetermined position proximal to the upper limit<br>
stopper 54, the load control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator<br>
63 so as to cause the driving rod 63a to project leftward by the biasing force<br>
of the spring.<br>
In the aforementioned modification of the second embodiment too, a<br>
left-off feeling can be given, during the depression stroke of the key 10, to<br>
the key depression operation of the human player by the horizontal portion<br>
65b of the load member 65 engaging with the rear end portion of the mass<br>
body 42. Further, during the release stroke of the key 10, the horizontal<br>
portion 65b of the load member 65 is disengaged from the rear end portion<br>
of the mass body 42 so that the returning velocity of the key 10 can be<br>
accelerated and thus a good successive depression performance can be<br>
maintained. Furthermore, in this modification too, if the same key 10 has<br>
been again depressed before the first switch 52a changes from the ON state<br>
to the OFF state, i.e. the same key 10 has been depressed successively more<br>
rapidly than in the aforementioned successive depression, the driving rod<br>
63a of the actuator 63 can continue to be is kept by the spring in the<br>
leftward projecting position. Namely, in this case, the load control circuit<br>
70 does not detect a change from the OFF state to the ON state of the first<br>
switch 52a and does not drive the actuator 63. Thus, in this modification<br>
too, during the rapid successive depression operation of the key 10, the<br>
horizontal portion 65b of the load member 65 does not engage (or contact)<br>
with the rear end portion of the mass body 42 during the key depression<br>
stroke too, and thus, a performance involving rapid successive depression<br>
operation of the key 10 can be executed with ease.<br>
b. Third Embodiment'-<br>
Next, a description will be given about the electronic musical<br>
instrument keyboard apparatus according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention, which is constructed to give a load to the pivoting<br>
movement of the key 10 and pivot lever 40. Fig. 7 is a vertical sectional<br><br>
view of the electronic musical instrument keyboard apparatus according to<br>
the third embodiment of the present invention. This keyboard apparatus<br>
includes, in place of the support table 30 employed in the first and second<br>
embodiments, a bottom plate 31 elongated in the left-right direction of the<br>
keyboard apparatus and formed by processing wood. Front plate 32<br>
elongated in the left-right direction of the keyboard apparatus is fixed to<br>
the front longitudinal end edge of the bottom plate 31 and extends<br>
vertically upward from the front longitudinal end edge of the bottom plate<br>
31, and a metal back surface panel 33 elongated in the left-right direction<br>
of the keyboard apparatus is fixed to the rear upper surface of the bottom<br>
plate 31 and extends vertically upward from the rear upper surface of the<br>
bottom plate 31. The key frame 20 in the third embodiment has a<br>
different shape from that employed in the first and second embodiments,<br>
and the key 10 is pivotably supported by the key frame 20 in a space<br>
surrounded by the bottom plate 31, front plate 32 and back surface panel<br>
33.<br>
Key support member 25 is fixed to the upper surface of a rear portion<br>
of the key frame 20, and this key support member 25 supports the key 10 in<br>
such a manner that the key 10 is pivotable about the axis of a pin 25a at a<br>
rear end portion of the key support member 25; the key support member 25<br>
permits vertical pivoting movement of the key 10. The third embodiment<br>
of the keyboard apparatus, shaped differently from the above-described<br>
first and second embodiments, also includes the pivot lever 40 for normally<br>
urging the front end portion of the key 10 upward by the weight of the lever<br>
40 and for limiting the front end portion of the key 10 to predetermined<br>
upper and lower positions. In this case too, the pivot lever 40 includes a<br>
lever base section 44 and mass body 45. The lever base section 44 is<br>
formed of synthetic resin and supported at a rear end portion on a lever<br>
support section 26 provided on the underside of the key frame 20 in such a<br>
manner that it is pivotable about the axis of a pin 26a. In this case too,<br><br>
the lever base section 44 has a pair of upper and lower leg portions 44a and<br>
44b at its front end. The upper leg portion 44a has a smaller length than<br>
the lower leg portion 44b. Lower end wall portion of the driving portion 13<br>
of the key 10 is located between and engages with the upper and lower leg<br>
portions 44a and 44b. Thus, as the key 10 is released from the depressed<br>
position, the front end portion of the pivot lever 40 is displaced upward due<br>
to the weight of the lever 40, so that the front end portion of the key 10 is<br>
displaced upward. As the key 10 is depressed, on the other hand, the<br>
lower end surface of the lower end wall portion of the driving portion 13<br>
presses the upper surface of the leg portion 44b, and the front end portion<br>
of the pivot lever 40 is displaced downward.<br>
The mass body 45 is in the form of a metal rod and fixed at its front<br>
end portion to the lever base section 44, and a resin-made stopper member<br>
45a is integrally fixed to a rear end portion of the mass body 45. Similarly<br>
to the mass body 42 in the first and second embodiments, the mass body 45<br>
urges the pivot lever 40 in the clockwise direction by its own weight. As<br>
the key 10 is released from the depressed position, the stopper member 45a<br>
abuts against the lower limit stopper 53 to limit clockwise pivoting<br>
movement of the pivot lever 40. As the key 10 is depressed, on the other<br>
hand, the stopper member 45a abuts against the upper limit stopper 54 to<br>
limit counterclockwise pivoting movement of the pivot lever 40. In the<br>
third embodiment too, the mass bodies 45 or stopper members 45a<br>
corresponding to the keys 10 have weights differing on the keybykey or<br>
key range-by key range basis so that the key depression touch becomes<br>
heavier for the keys 10 of lower pitches or lower pitch ranges.<br>
Further, in the third embodiment, the key switch 52 is provided on<br>
the upper surface of a middle region, in the front-rear direction of the<br>
keyboard apparatus, of the key frame 20 and is depressed by a switch<br>
driving portion 14 provided on the underside of the key 10. The key<br>
switch 52 comprises first, second and third switches 52a, 52b and 52c as in<br><br>
the first and second embodiments. As the key 10 is depressed, the first,<br>
second and third switches 52a, 52b and 52c sequentially turn ON in the<br>
order of mentioning, while, as the key 10 is released, the third, second and<br>
first switches 52c, 52b and 52a turned OFF in the order of mentioning.<br>
The driving unit 60 is provided in opposed relation to the rear end<br>
surface of the key 10. The driving unit 60 includes the actuators 63<br>
accommodated in the case 62 fixed to the key frame 20 and back surface<br>
panel 33. Each of the actuator 63 is constructed similarly to that in the<br>
first and second embodiments, and the driving rod 63a retractably projects<br>
out of the case 62 toward the rear end surface of the key 10. In this case,<br>
the driving rod 63a is normally urged by the built-in spring in the leftward<br>
direction of the figure, and a load member 67 is held in a leftward<br>
projecting position when the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state. Once<br>
driven, the actuator 63 retracts the driving rod 63a rightwardly.<br>
The load member 67 is fixed to the distal end of the driving rod 63a.<br>
The load member 67 is formed of an elastic substance, such as rubber or<br>
elastomer, and its front end surface 67a is recessed to have an arcuate<br>
sectional shape (as viewed transversely to the axis of the load member 67)<br>
and opposed to the rear end surface 15 of the key 10. The rear end surface<br>
15 of the key 10 is formed convexly to have an arcuate sectional shape.<br>
When the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state, the front end surface 67a<br>
of the load member 67 is held in abutting engagement (or contact) with the<br>
rear end surface 15 of the key 10, and as the key 10 is depressed, the load<br>
member 67 gives a load to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot<br>
lever 40 by a frictional force between the front end surface 67a and the rear<br>
end surface 15. When the actuator 63 is driven, the load member 67 is<br>
retracted rightward, so that the front end surface 67a of the load member<br>
67 disengages from the rear end surface 15 of the key 10. The front end<br>
surface 67a of the load member 67 and the rear end surface 15 of the key 10<br>
may be formed into a non-arcuate sectional shape, and the intensity of the<br><br>
load to be imparted to the pivoting movement of the key 10 and pivot lever<br>
40 is adjustable by adjusting any of the driving force of the actuator 63,<br>
substance of the load member 67, shapes of the front end surface 67a of the<br>
load member 67 and the rear end surface 15 of the key 10, etc.<br>
Further, the third embodiment of the keyboard apparatus includes, in<br>
addition to the proximity sensor 55 for detecting proximity of the mass<br>
body 45 during upward displacement of the mass body 45, a proximity<br>
sensor 56 fixed on the upper surface of the bottom plate 31 for detecting<br>
proximity of the mass body 45 during downward displacement of the mass<br>
body 45. The proximity sensor 56 is constructed similarly to the proximity<br>
sensor 55, and it detects proximity of the stopper member 45a (mass body<br>
45) when or immediately before the stopper member 45a abuts against the<br>
lower limit stopper 53. Once the proximity sensor 55 detects proximity of<br>
the mass body 45 as the mass body 45 approaches the lower limit stopper<br>
54, the load control circuit 70 drives the actuator 63 to retract the load<br>
member 67 in the rightward direction of Fig. 7. Further, once the<br>
proximity sensor 56 detects proximity of the mass body 45, i.e. shifts from<br>
the	non-mass-body-proximitydetecting	state	to	the<br>
mass^bodyproximitydetecting state, the load control circuit 70 terminates<br>
the driving of the actuator 63 to thereby cause the load member 67 project<br>
in the leftward direction of Fig. 7.<br>
Next, a description will be given about behavior of the keyboard<br>
apparatus constructed as above according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Tone signal generation and termination of the tone<br>
signal generation responsive to depression/release operation of the key 10<br>
is similar to that in the above-described first and second embodiments. In<br>
the third embodiment, during depression/release operation of the key 10,<br>
the pivot lever 40 pivots to function as a reactive force to key depression.<br>
Further, in response to depression/release operation of the key 10, the load<br>
member 67 moves leftward and rightward in response to the driving of the<br><br>
actuator 63. When the key 10 is in the released position and the stopper<br>
member 45a of the mass body 45 is located over the lower limit stopper 53,<br>
the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state so that the driving rod 53 is kept<br>
in the leftward projecting position.<br>
When the key 10 is depressed to pivot counterclockwise with the key's<br>
rear end moving downward in the aforementioned state, a load is imparted<br>
to the depression operation of the key 10 because the front end surface of<br>
the load member 67 is in engagement (or contact) with the rear end surface<br>
of the key 10. As the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a move upward,<br>
in response to the key depression operation, to approach the proximity<br>
sensor 55, the proximity sensor 55 detects proximity of the mass body 45<br>
and stopper member 45a. In response to the detection by the proximity<br>
sensor 55, the load control circuit 70 retracts the actuator 63 in the<br>
rightward direction of the figure. Consequently, the load having been<br>
imparted by the load member 67 to the depressed key 10 is removed so that<br>
the key touch rapidly becomes light (i.e., the reactive force to the depressed<br>
rapidly key decreases), and thus, the human player can enjoy a let-off<br>
feeling. After that, the upward movement of the mass body 45 and stopper<br>
member 45a is terminated by the stopper member 45a abutting against the<br>
upper limit stopper 54.<br>
Then, once the depressed key 10 is released, the mass body 45 and<br>
stopper member 45a are displaced downward as the key 10 and pivot lever<br>
40 pivot. Because the front end surface 67a of the load member 67 is<br>
located out of contact with the rear end surface 15 of the key 10, the key 10<br>
pivots in the clockwise direction without contacting the front end surface<br>
67a of the load member 67, and the lower surface of the stopper member<br>
45a of the mass body 45 abuts against the lower limit stopper 53, so that<br>
the key 10 and pivot lever 40 stop pivoting. Thus, the returning velocity of<br>
the key 10 can be accelerated, which allows the key 10 to be successively<br>
depressed appropriately as desired and thus achieve a good successive<br><br>
depression performance of the keyboard apparatus. Further, during the<br>
release stroke, the proximity sensor 56 detects proximity of the mass body<br>
45 and stopper member 45a as the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a<br>
approach the sensor 56. In response to the detection by the proximity<br>
sensor 56, the load control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator<br>
63. Thus, the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63 is again pushed out<br>
leftward, so that the front end surface 67a of the load member 67 again<br>
engages (or contacts) with the rear end surface 15 of the key 10. Then, the<br>
aforementioned behavior is repeated once the key 10 is again depressed<br>
and released by the human player in such a state.<br>
During the release stroke, on the other hand, the actuator 63 is kept<br>
in the driven state, the load member 67 is kept retracted in the rightward<br>
direction of the figure and the front end surface 67a of the load member 67<br>
is kept out of engagement (or contact) with each other, before the proximity<br>
sensor 56 detects proximity of the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a.<br>
Thus, if the same key 10 has been again depressed before the proximity<br>
sensor 56 detects proximity of the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a,<br>
i.e. the same key 10 has been depressed successively more rapidly than in<br>
the aforementioned successive depression, the rear portion of the mass<br>
body 45 moves upward, in response to the key depression operation,<br>
without the front end surface 67a of the load member 67 engaging with the<br>
rear end surface 15 of the key 10. Thus, when rapid successive depression<br>
operation of the key 10 is to be performed, the human player can depress<br>
and release the key 10 with no load imparted from the load member 67 to<br>
the key 10. As a result, a performance involving rapid successive<br>
depression operation of the key 10 can be executed with ease.<br>
In a modification of the above-described third embodiment, the<br>
driving, by the load control circuit 70, of the actuator 63 may be controlled<br>
using the key switch 52 in place of the proximity sensor 56. In this case,<br>
the load control circuit 70 may terminate the driving of the actuator 63 in<br><br>
response to a change from the ON state to the OFF state of the first switch<br>
52a of the key switch 52. In this way, the modification can achieve the<br>
same advantageous results as the above-described third embodiment.<br>
In the third embodiment, as set forth above, the driving rod 63a of the<br>
actuator 63 is normally urged by the spring to in the leftward projecting<br>
position so that, in the release stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
driven to retract the driving rod 63a rightward against the biasing force of<br>
the spring. In a modification, however, the driving rod 63a of the actuator<br>
63 may be normally urged by the spring in the to rightward retracted<br>
position so that, in the depression stroke of the key 10, the actuator 63 is<br>
driven to cause the driving rod 63a to project leftward and thereby cause<br>
the front end surface 67a of the load member 67 to engage (or contact) with<br>
the rear end surface 15 of the key 10. In such a case, the load control<br>
circuit 70 drives the actuator 63 to cause the driving rod 63a to project<br>
leftward when the proximity sensor 56 shifts from the state where it is<br>
detecting proximity of the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a to the<br>
state where it is no more detecting proximity of the mass body 45 and<br>
stopper member 45a, taking electric power consumption into account.<br>
Then, once the rear end portion of the mass body 42 reaches the<br>
predetermined position proximal to the upper limit stopper 54, the load<br>
control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator 63 so as to retract<br>
the driving rod 63a rightward by the biasing force of the spring.<br>
In the aforementioned modification of the third embodiment too, a<br>
left-off feeling can be given, during the depression stroke of the key 10, to<br>
the key depression operation of the human player by the front end surface<br>
67a of the load member 67 engaging with the rear end surface 15 of the key<br>
10. Further, during the release stroke of the key 10, the front end surface<br>
67a of the load member 67 disengages from the rear end surface 15 of the<br>
key 10, so that the returning velocity of the key 10 can be accelerated and<br>
thus a good successive depression performance can be maintained.<br><br>
Furthermore, in this modification too, if the same key 10 has been again<br>
depressed before the proximity sensor 56 detects proximity of the mass<br>
body 45 and stopper member 45a, i.e. the same key 10 has been depressed<br>
successively more rapidly than in the aforementioned successive depression,<br>
the driving rod 63a of the actuator 63 is kept by the spring in the rightward<br>
retracted position. Namely, in this case, the load control circuit 70 does<br>
not perform the driving control on the actuator 63 in response to a change<br>
from the proximity-detecting state to the non-proximity-detecting state of<br>
the proximity sensor 56. Thus, in this modification too, during the rapid<br>
successive depression operation of the key 10, the front end surface 67a of<br>
the load member 67 engaging with the rear end surface 15 of the key 10<br>
does not engage (or contact) with the rear end surface 15 of the key 10, and<br>
thus, a performance involving rapid successive depression operation of the<br>
key 10 can be executed with ease.<br>
In such a modification of the above-described third embodiment too,<br>
the termination of the driving, by the load control circuit 70, of the actuator<br>
63 may be controlled using the key switch 52 in place of the proximity<br>
sensor 56. In this case, the load control circuit 70 may start the driving<br>
control of the actuator 63 in response to a change from the ON state to the<br>
OFF state of the first switch 52a of the key switch 52. In this way, the<br>
modification can achieve the same advantageous results as the<br>
above-described third embodiment.<br>
In further modifications of the first and second embodiments, the<br>
driving control of the actuator 63 by the load control circuit 70 using the<br>
key switch 52 may be performed by the load control circuit 70 using the<br>
proximity sensor 56 of the third embodiment. In such a case, the<br>
proximity sensor 56 in the third embodiment is used to detect proximity, to<br>
the lower stopper 53, of the mass body 42. In the first and second<br>
embodiments and modifications thereof, the load control circuit 70 may<br>
replace the driving control of the actuator 63 responsive to a change from<br><br>
the OFF state to the ON state of the first switch 52a with the driving<br>
control of the actuator 63 responsive to a change from the<br>
mass-bodyproximity detecting state to the non-mass-bodyproximity<br>
detecting state of the proximity sensor 56. Alternatively, the load control<br>
circuit 70 may replace such driving control of the actuator 63 responsive to<br>
a change from the ON state to the OFF state of the first switch 52a with<br>
the driving control responsive to a change from the<br>
non-mass-body-proximity detecting state to the mass-bodyproximity<br>
detecting state of the proximity sensor 56.<br>
d. Fourth Embodiment:<br>
Next, a description will be given about an electronic musical<br>
instrument keyboard apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Briefly stated, the fourth embodiment is applicable to<br>
any one of the first, second and third embodiments and modifications<br>
thereof and arranged to perform control for changing a load to be imparted<br>
by the load member 64, 65 or 67 in accordance with a key depressing<br>
velocity and tone pitch. In this case, the manner in which the driving<br>
control of the actuator 63 is to be performed by the load control apparatus<br>
70 differs among the first, second and third embodiments and modifications<br>
thereof. Only a portion of the driving control common to the first, second<br>
and third embodiments and modifications will first be explained first, and<br>
details of the application of the driving control, differing among to the first,<br>
second and third embodiments and modifications, will be later discussed.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram of an electric control unit which is common<br>
to (i.e., sharable among) the first, second, third embodiments and<br>
modifications thereof. To the load control circuit 70 are connected a key<br>
touch detection section 71, key touch-correspondent driving force<br>
determination section 72 and tone-pitch-dependent driving force<br>
determination section 73. These key touch detection section 71,<br>
keytouch-correspondent driving force determination section 72 and<br><br>
tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73 are<br>
implemented by a computer comprising a CPU, ROM, RAM, etc, and have<br>
the following functions performed through execution of software programs.<br>
The key touch detection section 71, detects depressing velocities of a<br>
plurality of keys 10, inputs signals from the first and second switches 52a<br>
and 52b of the key switches 52 corresponding to the keys 10. Then, the<br>
key touch detection section 71 measures a length of time from a time point<br>
when the first switch 52a has changed from the OFF state to the ON state<br>
to a time point when the second switch 52b changes from the OFF state to<br>
the ON state, to thereby detect a depressing velocity per key 10.<br>
The key touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72<br>
refers to a key touch — driving force table stored in the ROM, to determine<br>
a driving force of the actuator 63 corresponding to the key depressing<br>
velocity detected by the key touch detection section 71. As indicated by a<br>
solid line A (or solid line B) in Fig. 9, the key touch - driving force table has<br>
stored therein driving forces that increase or decrease as the key<br>
depressing velocity increases. The keytouch-correspondent driving force<br>
determination section 72 outputs to the load control circuit 70 a signal<br>
indicative of a driving force that increase or decrease as the key depressing<br>
velocity increases or decreases. The tone-pitch-dependent driving force<br>
determination section 73 inputs signals from the first switches 52a of the<br>
key switches 52 corresponding to the keys 10 and refers to a tone pitch -<br>
driving force table stored in the ROM to determine a driving force of the<br>
actuator 63 in accordance with a tone pitch of the key 10 of which the first<br>
switch 52a has changed from the OFF state to the ON state. As indicated<br>
by a solid line A (or solid line B) in Fig. 10, the tone pitch - driving force<br>
table has stored therein driving forces that increase or decrease as the tone<br>
pitch increases or decreases. The tone-pitch-dependent driving force<br>
determination section 73 outputs to the load control circuit 70 a signal<br>
indicative of a driving force that increase or decrease as the tone pitch<br><br>
increases. The solid lines A and B of Figs. 9 and 10 differ among the<br>
applications of the control according to the fourth embodiment to be<br>
explained below.<br>
d1. Application to the First Embodiment:<br>
In the first embodiment, the load member 64 is kept in the leftward<br>
projecting position by the biasing force of the spring while the actuator 63<br>
is in the non-driven state, as shown in Fig. 2A. While the actuator 63 is<br>
driven, the load member 64 is kept in the rightward retracted position<br>
against the biasing force of the spring. Once the proximity sensor 55<br>
detects proximity of the mass body 42, the load control circuit 70 drives the<br>
actuator 63 to retract the load member 64 rightward. Once the first<br>
switch 52a of the key switch 52 changes from the ON state to the OFF state,<br>
the load control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator 63.<br>
In such an application to the first embodiment, the<br>
key touch correspondent driving force determination section 72 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 9 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the key depressing velocity increases, and<br>
the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 10 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the tone pitch increases. Further, the load<br>
control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two driving forces and<br>
then drives the actuator immediately after the second switch 52b of the key<br>
switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON state, i.e. upon<br>
detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added driving force (i.e.,<br>
driving force equal to the sum of the determined two driving forces) is<br>
produced. Note that the driving force thus generated by the actuator 63 is<br>
smaller than the driving force with which the load member 64 is retracted<br>
rightward by the actuator 63 being driven upon detection, by the proximity<br>
sensor 55, of proximity of the mass body 42. The driving of the actuator 63<br>
responsive to the detection by the proximity sensor 55 and termination of<br><br>
the driving of the actuator 63 responsive to the change from the OFF state<br>
to the ON state of the first switch 52a is similar to that in the<br>
above-described first embodiment.<br>
When the actuator 63 is driven with the smaller driving force, the<br>
load member 64 is retracted rightward because of balance between the<br>
biasing force of the built-in spring and the driving force, but the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 engages (or contacts) with the load member 64<br>
as the mass body 42 moves upward. Because the added driving force<br>
increases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase, the<br>
rightward retracted amount of the load member 64 too increases as the key<br>
depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. Thus, the amount of the<br>
engagement between the rear end portion of the mass body 42 and the load<br>
member 64 during the upward movement of the mass body 42 decreases as<br>
the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. The load imparted<br>
from the load member 64 to the key 10 and pivot lever 40 in the key<br>
depression stroke decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch<br>
increase. Consequently, with this application of the control to the first<br>
embodiment, it is possible to give the human player a massive key touch in<br>
response to slow key depression and a light key touch in response to rapid<br>
key depression. Further, it is possible to give the human player a massive<br>
key touch in response to depression of a key in a low pitch range and light<br>
key touch in response to depression of a key in a high pitch range. As a<br>
result, the key touch feeling can be even further improved.<br>
d2. Application to the Modification of the First Embodiment:<br>
In the modification of the first embodiment, the load member 64 is<br>
kept in the rightward retracted position by the biasing force of the spring<br>
while the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state. While the actuator 63 is<br>
driven, the load member 64 is kept in the leftward projecting position<br>
against the biasing force of the spring. Once the first switch 52a of the<br>
key switch 52 changes from the OFF state to the ON state, the load control<br><br>
circuit 70 drives the actuator 63 to cause the driving rod 63a to project<br>
leftward. Further, once the rear end portion of the mass body 42 reaches<br>
the predetermined position proximal to the upper limit stopper 54, the load<br>
control circuit 70 terminates the driving of the actuator 63 so as to retract<br>
the driving rod 63a rightward by the biasing force of the spring.<br>
In such an application of the control to the modification of the first<br>
embodiment, the key touch-correspondent driving force determination<br>
section 72 employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 9<br>
to determine a driving force that decreases as the key depressing velocity<br>
increases, and the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section<br>
73 employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 10 to<br>
determine a driving force that decreases as the tone pitch increases.<br>
Further, the load control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two<br>
driving forces and then drives the actuator 63 immediately after the second<br>
switch 52b of the key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON<br>
state, i.e. upon detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added<br>
driving force is produced. Then, the load member 64 projects leftward and<br>
stops at a position where the driving force of the actuator 63 and the<br>
biasing force of the built-in spring balance. Note that, at the time of the<br>
upward movement of the mass member 42, the position where the load<br>
member 64 stops is where the rear end portion of the mass body 42 and the<br>
load member 64 engage (or contact) with each other. The driving of the<br>
actuator 63 responsive to the change from the OFF state to the ON state of<br>
the first switch 52a may be or may not be omitted as necessary. The<br>
driving termination of the actuator 63 responsive to the detection by the<br>
proximity sensor 55 is similar to that in the above-described modification of<br>
the first embodiment.<br>
Because the added driving force, equal to the sum of the driving forces<br>
determined in accordance with the key depressing key and tone pitch,<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase, the<br><br>
leftward projecting amount of the load member 64 too decreases as the key<br>
depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. Thus, the amount of the<br>
engagement (or contact) between the rear end portion of the mass body 42<br>
and the load member 64 during the upward movement of the mass body 42<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. The load<br>
imparted from the load member 64 to the key 10 and pivot lever 40 during<br>
the key depression stroke decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone<br>
pitch increase. Consequently, with this application to the modification of<br>
the first embodiment too, it is possible to even further improve the key<br>
touch feeling.<br>
d3. Application to the Second Embodiment:<br>
In the above-described second embodiment, the driving rod 63a is<br>
kept in the rightward retracted position and the load member 65 is<br>
normally urged in the counterclockwise direction by the biasing force of the<br>
spring while the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
When the actuator 63 is driven, the driving rod 63a projects leftward so<br>
that the load member 65 pivots in the clockwise direction against the<br>
biasing force of the spring or weight. Once the proximity sensor 55 detects<br>
proximity of the mass body 42, the load control circuit 70 drives the<br>
actuator 63 to cause the load member 64 to pivot in the clockwise direction<br>
rightward. Once the first switch 52a of the key switch 52 changes from<br>
the ON state to the OFF state, the load control circuit 70 terminates the<br>
driving of the actuator 63.<br>
In such an application to the second embodiment, the<br>
key-touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 9 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the key depressing velocity increases, and<br>
the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 10 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the tone pitch increases. Further, the load<br><br>
control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two driving forces and<br>
then drives the actuator 63 immediately after the second switch 52b of the<br>
key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON state, i.e. upon<br>
detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added driving force (i.e.,<br>
driving force equal to the sum of the determined two driving forces) is<br>
produced. Note that the driving force thus generated by the actuator 63 is<br>
smaller than the driving force with which the load member 65 is caused to<br>
pivot clockwise by the actuator 63 being driven upon detection, by the<br>
proximity sensor 55, of proximity of the mass body 42. The driving of the<br>
actuator 63 responsive to the detection by the proximity sensor 55 and<br>
termination of the driving of the actuator 63 responsive to the change from<br>
the OFF state to the ON state of the first switch 52a is similar to that in<br>
the above-described second embodiment.<br>
When the actuator 63 is driven with the smaller driving force, the<br>
load member 64 pivots clockwise by virtue of balance between the driving<br>
force and the biasing force of the built-in spring or weight, but the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 engages (or contacts) with the load member 65<br>
as the mass body 42 moves upward. Because the added driving force<br>
increases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase, the<br>
amount of the clockwise pivoting movement of the load member 65 too<br>
increases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. Thus,<br>
the amount of the engagement (or contact) between the rear end portion of<br>
the mass body 42 and the load member 65 during the upward movement of<br>
the mass body 42 decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch<br>
increase. The load imparted from the load member 65 to the key 10 and<br>
pivot lever 40 in the key depression stroke decreases as the key depressing<br>
velocity and tone pitch increase. Consequently, with this application to<br>
the second embodiment too, the key touch feeling can be even further<br>
improved.<br>
d4. Application to the Modification of the Second Embodiment:<br><br>
In the above-described modification of the second embodiment, the<br>
driving rod 63a is kept in the leftward projecting position by the biasing<br>
force of the spring and the load member 65 is in the clockwise pivoting<br>
position against the biasing force of the spring or weight while the actuator<br>
63 is in the non-driven state. When the actuator 63 is driven, the driving<br>
rod 63a is retracted rightward, and the load member 65 pivots<br>
counterclockwise by the biasing force of the spring or weight. Once the<br>
first switch 52a of the key switch 52 changes from the OFF state to the ON<br>
state, the load control circuit 70 drives the actuator 63 to retract the<br>
driving rod 63a rightward and thereby causes the load member 65 to pivot<br>
counterclockwise. Further, once the sensor 55 detects that the rear end<br>
portion of the mass body 42 has reached the predetermined position<br>
proximal to the upper limit stopper 54, the load control circuit 70<br>
terminates the driving of the actuator 63 so as to cause the driving rod 63a<br>
to project leftward by the biasing force of the spring.<br>
In such an application to the modification of the second embodiment,<br>
the key touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72<br>
employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 9 to<br>
determine a driving force that decreases as the key depressing velocity<br>
increases, and the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section<br>
73 employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 10 to<br>
determine a driving force that decreases as the tone pitch increases.<br>
Further, the load control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two<br>
driving forces and then drives the actuator 63 immediately after the second<br>
switch 52b of the key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON<br>
state, i.e. upon detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added<br>
driving force is produced. Then, the driving rod 63 is retracted rightward,<br>
and the load member 65 pivots counterclockwise and stops at a position<br>
where the driving force of the actuator 63 and the biasing force of the<br>
built-in spring balance. Note that, at the time of the upward movement of<br><br>
the mass member 42, the position where the load member 65 stops is where<br>
the rear end portion of the mass body 42 and the horizontal portion 65b of<br>
the load member 64 engage (or contact) with each other. The driving of<br>
the actuator 63 responsive to the change from the OFF state to the ON<br>
state of the first switch 52a may be or may not be omitted as necessary.<br>
The driving termination of the actuator 63 responsive to the detection by<br>
the proximity sensor 55 is similar to that in the above-described<br>
modification of the second embodiment.<br>
Because the added driving force, equal to the sum of the driving forces<br>
determined in accordance with the key depressing key and tone pitch,<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase, the<br>
amount of the pivoting movement in the counterclockwise direction of the<br>
load member 65 too decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch<br>
increase. Thus, the amount of the engagement (or contact) between the<br>
rear end portion of the mass body 42 and the load member 64 during the<br>
upward movement of the mass body 42 decreases as the key depressing<br>
velocity and tone pitch increase. The load imparted from the load member<br>
64 to the key 10 and pivot lever 40 during the key depression stroke<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase.<br>
Consequently, with this application to the modification of the second<br>
embodiment too, it is possible to even further improve the key touch<br>
feeling.<br>
d5. Application to the Third Embodiment:<br>
In the above-described third embodiment, the driving rod 63a is<br>
normally urged in the leftward direction by the biasing force of the spring<br>
and the load member 67 is kept in the leftward projecting position while<br>
the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state, as shown in Fig. 7. When the<br>
actuator 63 is driven, the driving rod 63a is retracted rightward so that the<br>
load member 67 moves rightward. Once the proximity sensor 55 detects<br>
proximity of the mass body 42, the load control circuit 70 drives the<br><br>
actuator 63 to retract the load member 67 rightward. Further, once the<br>
proximity sensor 56 changes from the non-mass-body-proximity detecting<br>
state to the mass-body-proximity detecting state, the load control circuit 70<br>
terminates the driving of the actuator 63 to cause the load member 67 to<br>
project leftward.<br>
In such an application to the third embodiment, the<br>
key-touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 9 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the key depressing velocity increases, and<br>
the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73 employs<br>
the characteristic indicated by the solid line A of Fig. 10 to determine a<br>
driving force that increases as the tone pitch increases. Further, the load<br>
control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two driving forces and<br>
then drives the actuator 63 immediately after the second switch 52b of the<br>
key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON state, i.e. upon<br>
detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added driving force (i.e.,<br>
driving force equal to the sum of the determined two driving forces) is<br>
produced. Note that the driving force thus generated by the actuator 63 is<br>
smaller than the driving force with which the load member 67 is retracted<br>
rightward by the actuator 63 being driven upon detection, by the proximity<br>
sensor 55, of proximity of the mass body 42. The driving of the actuator 63<br>
responsive to the detection by the proximity sensor 55 and termination of<br>
the driving of the actuator 63 responsive to the detection by the proximity<br>
sensor 56 is similar to that in the above-described third embodiment.<br>
When the actuator 63 is driven with the smaller driving force, the<br>
front end surface 67a of the load member 67 engages (or contacts) with the<br>
rear end surface 15 of the mass body 42 as the mass body 42 moves upward.<br>
Because the added driving force increases as the key depressing velocity<br>
and tone pitch increase, the amount of the rightward retraction of the load<br>
member 67 too increases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch<br><br>
increase. Thus, the amount of the engagement (or contact / friction)<br>
between the rear end portion of the mass body 42 and the horizontal<br>
portion of the load member 67 during the upward movement of the mass<br>
body 42 decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase.<br>
The load imparted from the load member 67 to the key 10 and pivot lever<br>
40 during the key depression stroke decreases as the key depressing<br>
velocity and tone pitch increase. Consequently, with this application to<br>
the third embodiment too, the key touch feeling can be even further<br>
improved.<br>
d6. Application to the Modification of the Third Embodiment:<br>
In the above-described modification of the third embodiment, the<br>
driving rod 63a is normally urged in the rightward direction by the biasing<br>
force of the spring and the load member 67 is kept in the rightward<br>
retracted position while the actuator 63 is in the non-driven state. When<br>
the actuator 63 is driven, the driving rod 63a projects leftward so that the<br>
load member 67 moves leftward. Once the proximity sensor 56 changes<br>
from the state where it is detecting proximity of the mass body 45 and<br>
stopper member 45a to the state where it is no more detecting proximity of<br>
the mass body 45 and stopper member 45a, the load control circuit 70<br>
drives the actuator 63 to cause the driving rod 63a to project leftward.<br>
Further, once the proximity sensor 55 detects that the rear end portion of<br>
the mass body 42 has reached the predetermined position proximal to the<br>
upper limit stopper 54, the load control circuit 70 terminates the driving of<br>
the actuator 63 so as to retract the driving rod 63a rightward by the<br>
biasing force of the spring.<br>
In such an application to the modification of the third embodiment,<br>
the keytouch correspondent driving force determination section 72<br>
employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 9 to<br>
determine a driving force that decreases as the key depressing velocity<br>
increases, and the tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section<br><br>
73 employs the characteristic indicated by the solid line B of Fig. 10 to<br>
determine a driving force that decreases as the tone pitch increases.<br>
Further, the load control circuit 70 adds together the thus-determined two<br>
driving forces and then drives the actuator 63 immediately after the second<br>
switch 52b of the key switch 52 has changed from the OFF state to the ON<br>
state, i.e. upon detection of the key depressing velocity, so that the added<br>
driving force is produced. Then, the driving rod 63 projects leftward and<br>
stops at a position where the driving force of the actuator 63 and the<br>
biasing force of the built-in spring balance. In this state, whereas the<br>
front end surface 67a of the load member 67 is abutting against the rear<br>
end surface 15 of the key 10, the abutting or pressing force of the front end<br>
surface 67a of the load member 67 is smaller than that in the<br>
above-described modification of the third embodiment. The driving of the<br>
actuator 63 responsive to the detection by the proximity sensor 56 may be<br>
or may not be omitted as necessary. The driving termination of the<br>
actuator 63 responsive to the detection by the proximity sensor 55 is<br>
similar to that in the above-described modification of the third<br>
embodiment.<br>
Because the added driving force, equal to the sum of the driving forces<br>
determined in accordance with the key depressing key and tone pitch,<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase, so that<br>
the amount of the counterclockwise direction of the load member 65<br>
decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. Thus,<br>
the amount of the engagement (or contact / friction) of the front end surface<br>
67a of the load member 67 with the rear end surface 15 of the key 10 in the<br>
key depression stroke decreases as the key depressing velocity and tone<br>
pitch increase. Thus, the load imparted from the load member 67 to the<br>
key 10 and pivot lever 40 in the key depression stroke decreases as the key<br>
depressing velocity and tone pitch increase. Consequently, with this<br>
application to the modification of the third embodiment too, it is possible to<br><br>
even further improve the key touch feeling.<br>
d7. Modification of the Fourth Embodiment:<br>
In the above-described fourth embodiment, the load control circuit 70<br>
is constructed to add together the driving forces determined by the<br>
 key-touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72 and<br>
tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73 and perform<br>
the driving control of the actuator 63 in accordance with a control signal<br>
indicative of the sum of the two driving forces. Alternatively, the load<br>
control circuit 70 may be constructed to multiply together the driving forces<br>
 determined by the key-touch-correspondent driving force determination<br>
section 72 and tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73<br>
and perform the driving control of the actuator 63 in accordance with a<br>
control signal indicative of the product of the two driving forces. What<br>
matters here is to allow the driving forces, determined by the<br>
key-touch-correspondent driving force determination section 72 and<br>
tone-pitch-dependent driving force determination section 73, to be used in<br>
the driving control of the actuator 63.<br>
Further, whereas the fourth embodiment has been described as<br>
constructed to vary the driving force continuously in accordance with<br>
variation in the key depressing velocity, the driving force may be varied in<br>
a stepwise fashion in accordance with variation in the key depressing<br>
velocity. Furthermore, the driving force may be varied in a stepwise<br>
fashion in accordance with variation in the tone pitch. Furthermore,<br>
relationship between the key depressing velocity and the driving force and<br>
relationship between the tone pitch and the driving force may be defined<br>
using respective predetermined functions.<br>
Furthermore, in the driving force control responsive to the tone pitch,<br>
i.e. the control for imparting a load to the depressed key in accordance with<br>
the tone pitch, the load to be imparted to the depressed key may be<br>
changed through a given mechanical mechanism without the style of the<br><br>
driving control of the actuator 63 being changed in accordance with the<br>
tone pitch. Namely, in the above-described first embodiment, the load to<br>
be imparted to the depressed key by the load member 64 may be preset at<br>
different intensity values corresponding to various tone pitches by<br>
adjusting the projecting amount, shape, material, etc. of the load member<br>
67 per key. In the above-described second embodiment, the load to be<br>
imparted to the depressed key by the load member 65 may be preset at<br>
different intensity values corresponding to various tone pitches by<br>
adjusting the pivoting amount, shape, material, etc. of the load member 66<br>
per key. Further, in the above-described third embodiment, the load to be<br>
imparted to the depressed key by the load member 67 may be preset at<br>
different intensity values corresponding to various tone pitches by<br>
adjusting the shapes of the front end surface 67a and rear end surface 15 of<br>
the key 10, etc.<br>
Furthermore, the fourth embodiment has been described above as<br>
applying, to the first embodiment, second embodiment and modifications<br>
thereof, the control responsive to the key depressing velocity and tone pitch,<br>
only in relation to control of the actuator 63 based on operation of the key<br>
switch 52 and detection by the proximity sensor 55. However, as set forth<br>
above in relation to the modification of the third embodiment, the control of<br>
the actuator 63 based on operation of the key switch 52 may be replaced<br>
with control based on detection by the proximity sensor 56. Further, the<br>
control responsive to the key depressing velocity and tone pitch to be<br>
performed on the third embodiment and modification thereof has been<br>
described above only in relation to control of the actuator 63 based on<br>
detection by the proximity sensors 55 and 56. Alternatively, as set forth<br>
above in relation to the modification of the third embodiment, the control of<br>
the actuator 63 based on detection by the proximity sensors 55 and 56 may<br>
be replaced with control based on operation of the key switch 52.<br>
Furthermore, the fourth embodiment has been described above as<br><br>
varying the intensity of the load, which is to be imparted from the load<br>
member 64, 65 or 67 to a depressed key, in accordance with the key touch<br>
and tone pitch. Alternatively, the intensity of the load to be imparted from<br>
the load member 64, 65 or 67 to a depressed key may be controlled in<br>
accordance with only one of the key touch and tone pitch,<br>
e. Other Modification:<br>
The present invention should not be construed as limited to the<br>
above-described embodiments, and various modifications of the invention<br>
are also possible without departing from the purposes and basic principles<br>
of the invention.<br>
The first to fourth embodiments have been described above as<br>
constructed to detect a position of the mass body 42 or 45 by means of the<br>
proximity sensors 55 and 56. However, because the proximity sensors 55<br>
and 56 detect pivoting positions of the key 10 and pivot lever 40, moving<br>
positions of other portions of the key 10 and pivot lever 40 may be detected.<br>
Further, the proximity sensors 55 and 56 may be replaced with contact<br>
switches, so as to detect contact with the contact switches in place of the<br>
proximity to the proximity sensors 55 and 56. Further, the first to the<br>
fourth embodiments have been described above as terminating the<br>
engagement (or contact) between the load member 64, 65 or 67 and the<br>
mass body 42 or 45 and key 10 during the key release stroke.<br>
Alternatively, the engagement (or contact) may be terminated in response<br>
to detection of a change from the ON state to the OFF state or from the<br>
OFF state to the ON state of the third switch 52c of the key switch 52.<br>
Further, the first to fourth embodiments have been described above as<br>
causing the front end portion of the key 10 to swing vertically with the rear<br>
end portion as the pivot point. However, the pivot point of the key 10 may<br>
be other than the rear end portion of the key 10, such a middle portion of<br>
the key 10. In such a case, the key switch 52 for detecting depression and<br>
release of the key 10 may be provided on a rear portion of the key 10 so<br><br>
that the key switch 52 is activated in response to displacement of the rear<br>
end portion of the key 10. Further, the first to fourth embodiments have<br>
been described above as using the mass body 42 or 45 as a means for<br>
imparting a reactive force to key depression operation. Alternatively, in<br>
place of or in addition to the mass body 42 or 45, a spring may be employed,<br>
as the means for imparting a reactive force to key depression operation, to<br>
normally urge the key 10 upwardly.<br>
Furthermore, the first to fourth embodiments have been described<br>
above as detecting a key depressing velocity on the basis of outputs from<br>
the first and second switches 52a and 52b of the key switch 52. However,<br>
the key depressing velocity may be detected in various other manners as<br>
along as a moving velocity of the key 10 or pivot lever 40 can be detected<br>
appropriately; for example, the moving velocity of the key 10 or pivot lever<br>
40 may be detected electromagnetically by use of a coil or solenoid. In<br>
another alternative, the key depressing velocity may be detected by<br>
detecting a position of the key 10 or pivot lever 40 through electromagnetic<br>
induction, electrostatic capacitance, ultrasonic sound wave, photo-electric<br>
effect, magnetic change or the like and then differentiating the detected<br>
position.<br>
Furthermore, the first and second embodiments have been described<br>
above as imparting a load to depression operation of the key 10 by engaging<br>
the load member 64 or 65 with the rear end portion of the mass body 42 of<br>
the pivot lever 40, and the third embodiment has been described above as<br>
imparting a load to depression operation of the key 10 by engaging the load<br>
member 67 with the rear end surface of the key 10. However, the present<br>
invention is not so limited, and the load member may be caused to engage<br>
(or contact) with any other suitable portion of the key 10 or pivot lever 40<br>
as long as the load is imparted to the pivoting key 10 or pivot lever 40.<br>
For example, the load member may be caused to engage (or contact) with<br>
the front end portion 12 of the key 10, driving portion 13 of the key 10, or<br><br>
lever base section 41 or 44 of the pivot lever 40.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT KEYBOARD APPARATUS<br>
Key (10) is pivotably supported by a key frame (20), and the front end<br>
of the key is normally urged upward by a pivot lever (40). Load member<br>
(64) drivable by an actuator (63) is provided rearwardly of a mass body (42)<br>
of the pivot lever. Key switch (52) and proximity sensor (55) detect a<br>
pivoting position of the key responsive to depression and release operation<br>
of the key. Load control circuit (70) performs driving control of the<br>
actuator, in accordance with the pivoting position of the key, to move the<br>
load member back and forth, to thereby cause the load member to engage<br>
(or contact) with the mass body in a depression stroke and terminates the<br>
engagement in a release stroke.<br>
