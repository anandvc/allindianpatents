Background of the Invention<br><br>
a cap forlancing device<br>
The present invention generally relotes to lancing device for lancing<br>
denma! tissue and for withdrawing a fluid sample.<br>
Lancets in converntional are generally have a rigid body and a steribe<br>
needle which porturdes from end. The lancet may be used to pierce the skin, <br>
thereby enabling the collection of a blood sample from the opening.	The blood is then<br>
transferred to test collection device. Blood is most commonly taken from the<br>
fingertips, where there is generally an abundant supply. However, tbe nerve density in<br>
this region causcs significant pain in many patients. Sampling of alternate sites, such as<br>
earlobes and limbs, is sometimes practiced to access sites which are less sensitive.<br>
These sties are also less likely to provide sufficient blood volume, and make blood<br>
transfer directly to test devices difficult.<br>
Repeated lancing in limited surface areas (such as fingertips) results in<br>
callous formation. This leads to increased difficulty in drawing blood and increased pain<br>
to the user. To reduce the anxiety of picrcing the skin and the associated pain, many<br>
spring loaded devices have been developed.<br>
After puncturing the skin, conventional: lancing devices are laid down and<br>
the free hand of the user squeezes blood from the puncture wound. This technique<br>
requires a clean storage site for the lancing device and a two-hand operation. Once the<br>
drop of blood is expressed from the lancing site, the user transfers the blood to a test<br>
strip of a suitable meter.<br><br>
It is often desirable to collect the expressed sample from patient and<br>
then introduce the sample to a test device in a controlled fashion. Some blood glucose<br>
monitoring systems, for example, require that the blood sample be applied to a test<br>
device which is in contact with a test instrument. In such situations, bringing the finger<br>
of a patient directly to the test device poses some risk of contamination from blood of a<br>
previous patient. With such systems, particularly in hospital settings, it is common to<br>
lance a patient, collect a sample in a micropipette via capillary action and then deliver<br>
the sample from the pipette to the test device.<br>
However, these lancet devices do not extract ('squeeze out') a sufficient<br>
sample from the various surfaces for lancing. For example, the curved surface of a<br>
fingertip requires the right amount of pressure to be applied to extract blood quickly and<br>
efficiently from the patient Therefore, there is a need for a lancet system that can<br>
accommodate the lancing of curved surfaces (e.g., fingertips) as well as flat surfaces<br>
(e.g., forearm or leg) to express sufficient volume of blood or interstitial fluid, while<br>
concomitantly reducing pain experienced by the user.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a cap for a lancing device for lancing<br>
dermal tissue. The cap includes a cap body having a proximal end for connecting to the<br>
distal end of the housing of the lancing device and a contact ring attached to the distal<br>
end of the cap body. The contact ring includes an opening for a portion of the lancet of<br>
the lancing device to pass therethrough. The contact ring has a multi-contonred surface<br>
oriented generally about an axis distinct from the axis of motion of the lancet. The<br>
multi-contoured surface is designed to pressure the dermal tissue to facilitate expression<br>
of a fluid sample after lancing the dermal tissue. The fluid sample can include blood,<br>
interstitial fluid, or both.<br>
In accordance with one aspect; of the present mvention, the cap body is<br>
transparent to facilitate viewing of the quantity of blood expressed..<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the multi-<br>
contoured surface comprises an outer radial portion oriented at a first angle relative to<br>
the axis of the contact ring and an inner radial portion proximate the opening and<br><br>
oriented at a second angle, distinct from the first angle, relative to the axis of the contact<br>
ring.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the cap is<br>
removably and replaceably connected to the distal end of the housing.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a sleeve can<br>
be mounted about the cap body, the sleeve can be movable generally along the axis of<br>
motion of the lancet and relative to the cap body. The sleeve includes at least two legs<br>
for maintaining contact with me dermal tissue during expression of a blood sample after<br>
lancing the dermal tissue. In addition, the sleeve can be biased toward the distal end of<br>
the cap body, for example, by a spring.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the cap body<br>
includes a contact ring having a multi-contoured surface oriented to create a radially<br>
inwardly extending pressure-gradient, which extends towards a central aperture.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a cap for<br>
lancing curved dermal tissue is provided. The contact ring portion of the cap is<br>
comprised of a flexible material. The flexible material when placed against the lancing<br>
site conforms to the surface, and hence accommodates lancing of the curved dermal<br>
tissue to create a pressure gradient beneath the skin to express a suitable fluid sample.<br>
This flexible cap creates a pressure gradient and expresses dermal fluid on strongly<br>
curved and flat areas of the skin without having to change the cap or use a different<br>
lancing device.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a lancing<br>
device for lancing dermal tissue is provided. The lancing device includes a housing, a<br>
lancet and a cap. The cap includes a cap body and a contact ring having a multi-<br>
contoured surface oriented generally about an axis distinct from the axis of motion of<br>
the lancet The multi-contoured surface is designed to pressure the dermal tissue to<br>
facilitate expression of a fluid sample after lancing the dermal tissue. The fluid sample<br>
can include blood, interstitial fluid, or both.<br><br>

Description of Illustrated Embodiments<br>
The present invention is directed to a cap for use with a lancing device<br>
for lancing dermal tissue to express a fluid sample, such as blood, interstitial fluid, or<br>
both. We refer below to the expression of blood for purposes of simplicity, although it<br>
is intended to encompass the expression of interstitial fluid or both. The cap of the<br>
present invention is designed to facilitate the expression of blood after the dermal tissue<br>
is lanced by increasing the pressure on the dermal tissue surrounding the lancing site.<br>
This increase in pressure results in increased blood flow from the lancing site, thereby<br>
reducing the time necessary to express a sufficient quantity of blood and eliminating the<br>
need for placing the lancing device on a surface and using the other free hand to squeeze<br>
out the sample fluid.<br>
Moreover, the cap of the present invention is particularly suited for<br>
collecting blood samples from lancing sites other than on the fingertip of the patient,<br>
which is the traditional location for collecting blood samples. Use of such alternative<br>
sites can be less painful to the patient and also allows the patient to "rest" his or her<br>
fingertip. Suitable alternative sites include, but are not limited to, the forearms, the<br>
upper arms, the thighs, the palms, and the abdomen of a patient. Blood sample<br>
collection at alternative sites can be problematic as manually applying sufficient<br>
pressure on the dermal tissue proximate the lancing site to collect the blood sample can<br>
be difficult and typically results in low yields. The cap of the present invention allows<br>
the user to increase the amount of pressure at the lancing she such that a sufficient<br>
' quantity of blood can be expressed from the alternative sample site.<br>
A cap 10 in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 4. The cap 10 is design to be connected to the<br>
distal end of the housing 12 of a conventional lancing device. In a conventional lancing<br>
device a lancet 30 is mounted within the housing 12 of the lancing device and is<br>
movable along a first axis, indicated by line A in FIG. 1, relative to the housing 12. The<br>
lancet 30 can be driven along the first axis by the lancing device to puncture the dermal<br>
tissue. The blood sample can then be expressed for collection from the lancing she.<br>
Such conventional lancing devices are available from Lifescan, Inc. of Milpitas, CA,<br>
Palco Laboratories of Santa Cruz, CA, Therasense of Alameda, CA, and Amira Medical<br>
of Scotts Valley CA. In addition, lancing devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br><br>
5,730,753 to Morita, 6,045,567 to Taylor, and 6,071,250 to Douglas. Each of the<br>
aforementioned patents is incorporated herein by reference. One skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the cap of the present invention is not limited to the lancing devices<br>
described herein. The cap' of the present invention can be used with any lancing device<br>
employing a movable lancet for lancing dermal tissue. Moreover, the present invention<br>
is intended to include any device suitable for expressing a fluid sample from a user<br>
employing different extraction techniques, including the use of lancets, hollow and solid<br>
needles or microneedles, ultrasonic devices, thermal techniques, and the like. The<br>
device can be a simple lancing device as described above, or can include devices having<br>
integrated meters or measuring devices statable for testing an analyte, such as glucose.<br>
The cap 10 includes a cap body 14 having a proximal end 32 and a distal<br>
end 34 as best illustrated in FIG. 2. A contact ring "16 is attached to the distal end 34 of<br>
the cap body 36. An opening 18, shown in FIGS. 3 A and 4, is provided in the contact<br>
ring 16 to allow a portion of the lancet 30 to pass therethrough to effect puncturing of<br>
the dermal tissue.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the cap body 14 can include a connector 20 for<br>
removably and replaceably connecting the proximal end 32 of the cap body 14 to the<br>
distal end of me housing 12 of the lancing device. The connector 20 preferably is<br>
threaded to mate with corresponding threads provided in the housing 12 of the lancing<br>
device. One skilled in the art will recognize that alternative connecting mechanisms<br>
may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example,<br>
the connector 20 can be sized and shaped to snap-fit to the housing 12. In addition, the<br>
cap 10 can be permanently affixed to the housing 12, although, it is preferable for the<br>
cap 14 to be removably and replaceably connected to the housing 12.<br>
The cap body 14 can be constructed from a transparent, translucent or<br>
opaque material, such as a clear, transparent plastic, or includes a transparent portion<br>
forming a window to the interior of the cap body, or can be constructed of conventional<br>
non-transparent material. If transparent, the material should be sufficiently so to permit<br>
expressed blood to be viewed within the cap body 14. The transparency of the cap body<br>
14 allows the user to view the amount of blood expressed for collection from the lancing<br>
site, as discussed in more detail below.<br><br>
Referring to FIGS. 3A and 4A, the contact ring 16 preferably has a multi-<br>
contoured surface 22 for contacting the dermal tissue both during lancing and during<br>
blood sample expression. The multi-contoured surface 22 is oriented generally about a<br>
second axis, indicated by line B in FIG. 4A, distinct from the first axis A. In the<br>
preferred embodiment described herein the second axis B is perpendicular to the first<br>
axis A. One skilled in the art will recognize that the second axis is not limited to this<br>
preferred orientation and that any orientation distinct from the axis of motion of the<br>
lancet can be employed.<br>
The multi-contoured surface 22 is designed to pressure the dermal tissue<br>
to maximize blood flow rate from the periphery of the pressured area to the center of the<br>
lancing site and to facilitate the expression of a blood sample for collection. The term<br>
multi-contoured surface as used herein is intended to include two or more surfaces<br>
oriented at distinct angles with respect to each other and with respect to a common axis.<br>
The multi-contoured surface can extend inwardly from a vertical wall, or can extend<br>
inwardly from a flat surface extending radially inwardly from the vertical wall. Those<br>
of ordinary skill will recognize that the multi-contoured surface can include any selected<br>
number of surfaces. The surface can be, according to one practice, non-planar. In one<br>
embodiment described herein, the multi-contoured surface 22 is comprised of an outer<br>
radial portion 24 and an inner radial portion 26 proximate the opening 18. The outer<br>
radial portion 24 is preferably oriented at a first angle C relative to the second axis B.<br>
The inner radial portion 26 is preferably oriented at a second angle D, distinct from the<br>
first angle C, relative to the second axis B. The outer radial portion 24 and the inner<br>
radial portion 26 can have any selected surface feature or shape, e.g., can be linear,<br>
stepped, or curved. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer radial portion 24 is<br>
generally linear from the perimeter 28 of the contact, ring 16 to the intersection with the<br>
inner radial portion 26. Alternatively, the outer radial portion 24 can be convex or<br>
concave in curvature. Additionally, the inner radial portion 26 is generally concave in<br>
curvature, but can also be linear or convex.<br>
i<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, the angle C, corresponding to the slope of the outer<br>
radial portion 24, is in the range between about 5° and about 15°. Additionally, the<br>
radial extent of the outer radial portion 24, generally illustrated by line E in FIG. 3A, is<br>
preferably between about 25% to about 75% of the total radius of the contact ring 16, as<br>
measured from the center point CP of the contact ring 16 to the perimeter 28 of the<br><br>
contact ring 16. In a preferred embodiment, the radial extent E of me outer radial<br>
portion 24 is preferably about 50% of the total radius of the contact ring 16.<br>
The contact ring 16 can be constructed from plastic or other materials<br>
suitable for use in a medical instrument The contact ring 16 can have a non-transparent<br>
color, such as white, that is distinct and in contrast from the color of the dermal tissue.<br>
A contrasting color allows the user to better visualize the quantity of expressed blood.<br>
The contact ring 16 can be a separate, discrete component affixed to the<br>
cap body 14, or can be integrally formed with the cap body 14.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4B, the contact ring 16 of the cap 10 is sized and<br>
dimensioned to be placed in intimate facing contact with the skin of the user. When<br>
placed thereagainst, the contact ring creates a pressure gradient mat extends from the<br>
radial outer surface inwardly towards the opening 18. Specifically, when the skin is<br>
lanced by the lancet 30, the contact ring 16, which is disposed about the lancing site,<br>
creates a pressure gradient that urges fluid to flow toward the opening 18, as indicated<br>
by arrows 19.<br>
The pressure profile 31 created by the cap 10 has pressure peaks 33 that<br>
coincide with the perimeter portion of the cap, or with the start of the multi-contoured<br>
surface 22. The pressure is a maximum at mis portion since the cap contacts the skin of<br>
the user to a greater degree. When the surfaces of the multi-contoured surface extend<br>
inwardly towards the opening 18 and away from the skin, the overall pressure decreases.<br>
This forms a pressure gradient that extends from the outermost portion of the cap 10 to<br>
the opening 18. The illustrated pressure gradient 31 has decreases in a somewhat<br>
uniform manner across the surface 24, and in a more rapid manner across surface 26.<br>
Those of ordinary skill will recognize that the pressure profile will change as a function<br>
of the configuration of the contact ring.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3B, the contact ring 16 can include an anti-slip feature adapted to prevent the<br>
contact ring 16 and the cap 10 from moving relative to (or across) the surface of the skin<br>
during expression of a blood sample. According to one embodiment, ihe anti-slip<br>
feature comprises a suitable anti-slip material 23, such as rubber or silicone, that is<br>
attached, coupled or affixed to a portion of the multi-contoured surface 22 of the contact<br><br>
ring. The anti-slip material 23 ensures sufficient friction between the contact ring and<br>
the skin to resist movement of the contact ring relative to the skin surface. According to<br>
an alternate embodiment, the multi-contoured surface can be formed ro have selected<br>
surface features, such as protrusions or indentations, or can be toughened, to increase<br>
the friction between the contact ring and the skin. Alternatively, the entire contact ring<br>
can be formed from an anti-slip material to prevent movement<br>
FIG. 4C illustrates another embodiment of the contact ring 16 of the cap<br>
10 of the present invention. Like reference numerals designate like or similar parts plus<br>
a superscript prime. The illustrated contact ring 16' has an axially or vertically<br>
extending outer wall or perimeter 28' mat terminates at a distal end 29. The distal end<br>
29 includes a first flat face portion 29A that is adapted to press against the skin of the<br>
user during use. The flat face portion 29A is generally perpendicular to the perimeter<br>
portion 28*. The multi-contoured surface 22' extends, radially inwardly from the flat face<br>
portion 29A towards the opening 18'. The multi-contoured surface 22' extends between<br>
the annular flat face portion 29A, as indicated by the designation L. The multi-<br>
contoured surface can also be configured to include the flat face portion 29A. In mis<br>
embodiment, the multi-contoured surface includes three surfaces. Optionally, an anti-<br>
slip feature, comprising an anti-slip material or a roughened surface, may be<br>
incorporated in the contact ring 16' to prevent movement of the contact ring relative to<br>
the skin surface during expression of the blood sample.<br>
The illustrated multi-contoured surface 22' includes two or more surfaces<br>
oriented relative to each other to form different, distinct angles. In particular, the multi-<br>
contoured surface 22' includes a pair of surfaces 25 and 27. The radially outer surface<br>
25 is oriented at a first angle relative to the axis B. The radially inner surface 27 is<br>
oriented at a second angle relative to the axis B different from the first angle. As<br>
described above, the surfaces 25 and 27 can have any selected shape or angle.<br>
In use, the cap 10 is connected to the housing 12 of the lancing device<br>
and the dermal tissue is lanced by the lancet 30 passing through the opening 18 in the<br>
contact ring 16. The lancet 30 is then withdrawn into the cap 10 or the lancing device.<br>
The contact ring 16 is pressed into contact with the dermal tissue proximate the lancing<br>
site causing blood to exit the lancing site and after the cap 10 through the opening 18.<br>
Dermal tissue is "squeezed" into contact with the outer radial portion 24 and the inner<br>
radial portion 26 of the multi-contoured surface 22. The multi-contoured surface 22<br><br>
facilitates blood expression by increasing the hydrostatic pressure on the dermal tissue<br>
in contact with the perimeter 28 of the contact ring 16. The hydrostatic pressure on the<br>
dermal tissue decreases as the slope of the outer radial surface 24 and the inner radial<br>
surface changes toward the opening 18. This inwardly extending pressure gradient is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4B. Experimental testing has revealed that 1.5 ml to 3 ml of blood<br>
can easily be expressed from the lancing site using the cap 10 of the present invention at<br>
sampling sites other man the finger. In addition, because the cap body 14 can be<br>
transparent and the contact ring can be a contrasting color, such as white, the user can<br>
easily monitor the volume of blood expressed.	<br>
An alternative embodiment of the cap of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 5 through 9, in which a sleeve 60 is mounted about the cap body 14.<br>
The sleeve 60 is movable generally along the first axis A, i.e., along the axis of motion<br>
of the lancet, and relative to the cap body 60. The sleeve 60 comprises an annular collar<br>
62 and at least two legs 64A and 64B mat extend from the collar 62 in the direction of<br>
the first axis A toward the distal end 34 ofthe cap 10. The legs 64A and 64B taper from<br>
an increased width proximate the collar 62 to a decreased width proximate the contact<br>
ring 16.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, the legs 64A and 64B are arcuate in cross-section<br>
and encompass only a portion of the circumference of the contact ring 16. The legs 64A<br>
and 64B are preferably symmetrically disposed about the circumference of the contact<br>
ring 16. Although only two legs are illustrated, one skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
additional legs can be added without departing from the present invention. In addition,<br>
the legs need not be positioned symmetrically about the contact ring 16.<br>
The sleeve 60 is preferably slidable along an axis parallel to the first axis<br>
A, as indicated by arrow T in FIG. 5, A longitudinally extending slot 66 can be formed<br>
in one or both of sides of the cap body 14. A protruding guide member 68 can be<br>
formed in one or both the legs 64A and 64B. The guide member 68 is sized and<br>
shaped to slide within the slot 66 and inhibits lateral motion of the sleeve 60 relative to<br>
the cap body 14. Alternatively, the slot 66 can be formed in one or more of the legs 64A<br>
and 64B and the guide member 68 can be formed on the cap body 14.<br>
A spring 70 or other biasing mechanism can be provided to bias the<br>
sleeve 60 toward the distal end of the cap 10. One skilled in the art will appreciate that<br><br>
the sleeve 60 is not limited to use with the cap 10 of the present invention, but can be<br>
used with the cap of any lancing device.<br>
It is sometimes desirable to remove the cap 10 and the contact ring 16<br>
from contact with the dermal tissue after lancing, for example, to remove pressure from<br>
the dermal tissue or to visibly inspect the lancing site.. The sleeve 60 allows the user to<br>
maintain a portion of the lancing device, the legs 64A and 64B of the sleeve 60, in<br>
contact with skin when the cap 14 and the contact ring 16 are removed from contact<br>
with skin, as illustrated in FIG. 7. Importantly, the legs 64A and 64B allow me user to<br>
maintain the opening 18 in alignment with the lancing site when the contact ring is<br>
returned into contact with dermal tissue, as illustrated in FIG. 8. According to one<br>
embodiment, the sleeve legs 64A and 64B further include an anti-slip feature to prevent<br>
movement of the sleeve relative to the skin. An anti-slip material, such as rubber or<br>
silicone, may be affixed to me contact surface of the sleeve legs to prevent movement<br>
Alternatively, the anti-slip feature comprises a roughened surface where the sleeve legs<br>
contact the skin.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the legs 64A and 64B can be spaced apart a distance<br>
sufficient to allow a finger 80 of the user to fit between me legs 64A and 64B. The<br>
surfaces 67 connecting the two legs 64A and 64B can be curved, and are preferably<br>
parabolic in shape, to further facilitate the user's finger 80. In addition, the legs 64A<br>
and 64B, as well as the sleeve 60, can be constructed from a flexible, resilient material,<br>
such as a flexible plastic. The preferred material of choice is ABS plastic. As illustrated<br>
in FIGure 9, the user's finger 80 can be positioned between the legs 64A and 64B when<br>
the sleeve 60 is positioned beneath the cap 10. The legs 64A and 64B compress the<br>
user's finger therebetween to pinch or squeeze the dermal tissue. The user's finger can<br>
men be lanced and the compression of the user's finger by the legs 64A and 64B can<br>
facilitate the expression of blood from the lancing site.<br>
Alternate embodiments of the cap of the present invention are illustrated<br>
in FIGS. 10 through 13, in which the contact ring 16 is designed for lancing the sharp<br>
curve (or side) of the fingertip, as well as the ventral side of the fingertips.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another embodiment of the cap of the present<br>
invention. The cap 80 includes a cap body 81 having a proximal end 86. A contact ring<br>
85 is attached to the distal end 83 ofthe cap body 81. An opening 92 is provided in the<br><br>
contact ring 85 to allow a portion of the lancet 30 to pass through to effect puncturing of<br>
the fingertip. The illustrated cap body 81 can include a connector 84 for removably and<br>
replaceably connecting the proximal end 86 of the cap body 81 to the distal end of the<br>
housing 12 of the lancing device. For example, the connector 84 can be sized and<br>
shaped to fit the housing 12. the cap 80 can be permanently affixed to the housing 12,<br>
although it is preferable mat the cap 80 be removably and replaceably connected to the<br>
housing 12.<br>
The cap body 81 is constructed from transparent, translucent, or opaque<br>
material, such as clear or transparent plastic, or includes a transparent portion forming a<br>
window to the interior of the cap body. The material should be sufficiently transparent<br>
to allow the blood being expressed from within the cap body 81 to be viewed by the<br>
user. The transparency of the cap body 81 allows the view the amount of blood<br>
expressed for collection from the lancing, etc.<br>
The contact ring 85 preferably employs a pair of pressure wings 82 sized<br>
and dimensioned to accommodate the sharp curve of the fingertip therebetween. The<br>
pressure wings 82 thus form a recess 87 for accommodating the finger of the user. This<br>
applies the correct amount of pressure to allow for the expression of blood.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the pressure wings extend radially outward and<br>
away from the contact ring for contacting the fingertip bom during lancing and during<br>
blood sample by pressing. The pressure wings 82 and 82 constitute a multi-contoured<br>
surface that extendsfrom the outer periphery of the body 81 to the opening92. The<br>
multi-contoured surfece 88 is designed to pressure the fingertip to maximize blood flow<br>
rate from the lancing site and to facilitate me expression of blood for sample collection.<br>
The illustrated multi-contoured surface 88 comprises two or more non-planar surfaces<br>
disposed at distinct angles relative to each other and with respect to a common axis. For<br>
example, the pressure wings 82,82 that constitute the multi-contoured surface 88 is<br>
comprised of a radial outer portion 88A and a curved radial inner portion 88B proximate<br>
to the opening 92. The transition point between the surfaces 88A and 88B canbe<br>
arcuate, rounded, or sharp.<br>
The illustrated contact ring 85 can be constructed from plastic or other<br>
materials suitable for use in a medical instrument The contact ring 85 can have a non-<br>
transparent color that is distinct from the color of the fingertip. White is the preferred<br><br>
color of choice. A contrasting color allows the user to better visualize the quantity of<br>
blood expressed. The contact ring 85 can be a separate, discrete component affixed to<br>
the cap body 81, or can be integrally formed with the cap body 81.<br>
When in use, the cap 80 is connected to me housing 12 of the lancing<br>
device, and the fingertip of the user is placed in the recess 87 formed by the pressure<br>
wings 82,82. The lancet 30 ofthe device is deployed and passes through the opening<br>
92 in the contact ring 85 to pierce the skin. The contact ring 85 is pressed into contact<br>
with the fingertip proximate to the lancing site to express blood. The multi-contoured<br>
surface 87 facilitates blood expression by creating a pressure gradient that extends<br>
radially inwardly towards the opening 92. According to an alternate embodiment, an<br>
anti-slip feature on the contact ring 85 prevents movement of the contact ring relative to<br>
the skin surface when the contact ring is pressed into contact with the fingertip. As<br>
discussed, the anti-slip feature can comprise a suitable anti-slip material affixed to the<br>
multi-contoured surface, or a roughened multi-contoured surface. Alternatively, the<br>
contact ring 85 can be constructed entirely of a suitable anti-slip material to provide an<br>
anti-slip feature.<br>
FIGS. 12 and 13 illustrate another embodiment of the cap according to<br>
the teachings of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 12, the cap 90 includes a<br>
contact ring 95 attached to the distal end 97 of the cap body 94. An opening 124 formed<br>
in the contact ring 95 allows a portion of the lancet 30 to pass therethrough to create a<br>
puncture on the ventral side of the fingertip.<br>
The cap body 94 includes a connector 99 for removably and replaceably<br>
connecting a proximal end 98 ofthe cap body 94 to a distal end ofthe housing 12. For<br>
example, the connector 99 can be sized and shaped to fit the housing 12. Also, the cap<br>
90 can be permanently affixed to the housing 12. Preferably, the cap 93 is removably<br>
and replaceably connected to the housing 12. The cap body 94 is preferably similar to<br>
capbody 81of FIG. 10. The materials ofcap 80 are also the same for cap 93. The<br>
material can be transparent or include a transparent portion to allow expressed blood to<br>
be viewed within the cap 93.<br>
The illustrated contact ring 95 has a multi-contoured surface 96 that<br>
extends from the periphery ofthe cap body 94 to the central opening 101. The multi-<br>
contoured surface 96 can include two or more surfaces disposed at distinct angles<br><br>
relative to each other and with respect to a common axis. For example, the illustrated<br>
multi-contoured surface 96 is comprised of an outer radial portion 96A, a middle portion<br>
96B, and an inner radial portion 96C disposed proximate to the opening 101. The outer,<br>
middle and inner radial portions of the cap can have any selected surface feature or<br>
shape, e.g., can be linear, stepped, or curved. Moreover, the transition points between<br>
each surface 96A, 96B and 96C of the multi-contoured surface can have rounded,<br>
arcuate, or sharp surface features.<br>
The illustrated contact ring 95 can be constructed from plastic or other<br>
materials suitable for use in a medical instrument The contact ring 95 can have a non-<br>
transparent color mat is distinct from the color of the fingertip. White is the preferred<br>
color of choice. A contrasting color allows the user to better visualize the quantity of<br>
blood expressed. Similarly to cap 80, the contact ring 95 can be separated, discrete<br>
component affixed to the cap body 94, or can be integrally formed with the cap body 94.<br>
When in use, the cap 90 is connected to the housing 12 of the lancing<br>
device and the fingertip is placed in intimate facing contact with the ventral side finger<br>
and lanced by the lancet 30 passing through the opening 101 in the contact ring 96. The<br>
lancet 30 is withdrawn into the cap 90 or lancing device. The fingertip is squeezed into<br>
contact with the outer radial portion 96A, middle radial portion 96B, and inner radial<br>
portion 96C of the multi-contoured surface 96. The multi-contour surface 96 facilitates<br>
blood expression by creating a pressure gradient that extends radially inwardly toward<br>
the opening 101 from the perimeter 100 of the contact ring 95 or cap body 94.<br>
According to one embodiment, an anti-slip feature on the contact ring 95 prevents<br>
movement of the contact ring relative to the skin surface when the contact ring is<br>
pressed into contact with me fingertip. As discussed, the anti-slip feature can comprise<br>
a suitable anti-slip material, such as rubber or silicone, affixed to the multi-contoured<br>
surface. Alternatively, at least a portion of the multi-contoured surface comprises a<br>
roughened contact surface to ensure friction between the contact ring and the skin.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the cap of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 14-17 in which the contact region is designed with a flexible<br>
material for lancing various surfaces of a user.<br><br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate another embodiment of the cap for use at<br>
multiple different lancing sites according to the teachings of the present invention. The<br>
illustrated cap 110 includes a cap body 112 that terminates at a contact ring 114<br>
mounted at a distal end. The distal end 115 of me cap 110 can couple to the housing 12<br>
via any suitable structure. According to a preferred embodiment, the cap is permanently<br>
affixed to the housing, and hence not axially movable relative thereto. The contact ring<br>
114 of the cap 110 can include, if desired, a multi-contoured surface 118 having a<br>
plurality of surfaces oriented at angles relative to each other. A central opening can also<br>
be formed therein. According to an alternate embodiment, me contact ring can be a<br>
unitary structure with nominal surface features formed therein.<br>
The illustrated contact ring is preferably formed of a deformable,<br>
resilient, flexible material that is capable of conforming to the shape of the body region<br>
of the user placed in contact therewith. The contact ring can be preferably formed of a<br>
rubber material, polyurethane, latex, or other flexible material. The cap body 112 can<br>
also be formed of any suitable transparent, translucent, or opaque material, such as clear<br>
or transparent plastic, or can include a transparent portion forming a window to the<br>
interior of the cap body to enable the user to view the expressed blood. Alternatively,<br>
the cap can be formed of a non-transparent material.<br>
The contact ring 114 can be disposed in a rest position, FIG. 14, when not<br>
in contact with a lancing site, and hence no shape: is imparted to the ring. When placed<br>
in contact with the lancing site, such as the ventral side of a finger, or any other suitable<br>
portion of the finger, the contact ring conforms to the shape of the lancing site, FIG. 15.<br>
According to one embodiment, an anti-sup feature on the contact ring 114 prevents<br>
movement of the contact ring relative to the skin surface when the contact ring is<br>
pressed into contact with the fingertip. As discussed, die anti-slip feature can comprise<br>
a suitable anti-slip material, such as rubber or silicone, affixed to the multi-contoured<br>
&gt; surface. Alternatively, at least a portion of the multi-contoured surface comprises a<br>
roughened contact surface to ensure friction between the contact ring and the skin.<br>
According to an alternate embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 16 and 17,<br>
a cap 130 includes a cap body 132 that has mounted thereto a deformable contact ring<br>
134. The illustrated contact ring 134 has edge portions 136 that extend over or<br>
outwardly from the perimeter of the cap body 132. The contact ring can include, if<br><br>
desired, a multi-contoured surface having a plurality of surfaces oriented at angles<br>
relative to each other. A central opening can also be fanned therein. According to an<br>
alternate embodiment, the contact ring can be a unitary structure with nominal surface<br>
features formed therein.<br>
The contact ring can be preferably formed of rubber material,<br>
polyurethane, latex, or other flexible material. The contact ring 134 can be disposed in a<br>
rest position, FIG. 16, when not disposed in contact with a lancing site, and hence no<br>
shape is imparted to the ring. When placed in contact with the lancing she, such as the<br>
ventral side of a finger, or any other suitable portion of the finger, the contact ring 134<br>
conforms to the shape of the lancing site, FIG. 17. Moreover, when disposed in this<br>
position, the overhanging portions of the deformable contact ring, can 'flip' over and<br>
extend along the outer surface of the cap body 132 so it can be used on a flatter skin<br>
area, such as the forearm.<br>
The cap body 132 can includes a connector for removably and<br>
replaceably connecting a proximal end of the cap body 132 to a distal end of the housing<br>
12. According to one practice, the cap 130 can be permanently affixed to the housing<br>
12. Preferably, the cap 130 is removably and replaceably connected to the housing 12.<br>
Since certain changes may be made in me above constructions without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the<br>
above description or shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative<br>
and not in a limiting sense.<br>
