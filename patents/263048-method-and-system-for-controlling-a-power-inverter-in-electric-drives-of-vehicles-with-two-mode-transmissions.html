METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A POWER INVERTER<br>
IN ELECTRIC DRIVES OF VEHICLES WITH TWO-MODE<br>
TRANSMISSIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]       The present invention generally relates to power inverters, and<br>
more particularly relates to methods and  systems  for controlling power<br>
inverters   in   electric   drive   systems  of automobiles   utilizing  two-mode<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical systems within<br>
automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid, electric, and<br>
fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use an electric<br>
motor, perhaps in combination with another actuator, to drive the wheels.<br>
[0003] These types of vehicles can offer significant improvements in<br>
efficiency. There remains, however, an ever present need to improve the<br>
efficiency of electric motor drives to reduce power losses, improve battery<br>
life, and increase range. Additionally, it is generally desirable to reduce the<br>
noise generated from the automobile. Unfortunately, some techniques for<br>
reducing power losses in the electric motor system can increase acoustic noise<br>
emissions beyond acceptable levels.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a control method that<br>
reduces power losses and increases the efficiency of electric motors in<br>
automobiles, without excessively increasing the acoustic noise generated by<br>
the electrical motor. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics<br>
of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In one embodiment, a method for controlling a power inverter in an<br>
electric drive system of an automobile is provided. In general, the method<br>
controls the power inverter by, responsive to a commanded torque of the<br>
electric motor being below a first torque level, controlling the power inverter<br>
to set a switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The method reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above a dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
[0006] In a further embodiment, an automotive electric drive system is<br>
provided. The system includes a prime mover power source and a two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission, including first and second<br>
motors, coupled to the prime mover power source, a power inverter coupled to<br>
the first and second motors, and a processor coupled to the first and second<br>
motors and the power inverter. The at least one processor is configured to,<br>
responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor being below a first<br>
torque level, provide a signal controlling the power inverter to set a switching<br>
frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and, responsive to the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor being between the first torque level<br>
and a second torque level, provide a signal controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The system reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above a dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br><br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
[0007] In a further embodiment, an automotive electric drive system is<br>
provided. The system includes a prime mover power source and a two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission, including first and second<br>
motors, coupled to the prime mover power source, a power inverter coupled to<br>
the first and second motors, and a processor coupled to the first and second<br>
motors and the power inverter. The transmission includes an input member to<br>
receive power from the prime mover, an output member to deliver power from<br>
the transmission, first and second motors being coaxially aligned, first, second,<br>
and third coaxially aligned planetary gear arrangements, each planetary gear<br>
arrangement utilizing first, second and third gear members, the first and<br>
second motors being coaxially aligned with the three planetary gear<br>
arrangements, at least one of the first, second, and third gear members in the<br>
first or second planetary gear arrangement being connected to the first motor,<br>
and another one of the first, second, and third gear members in the second and<br>
third planetary gear arrangements being connected to the second motor, one of<br>
the gear members of the first planetary gear arrangement being continuously<br>
connected to the input member, a first torque-transmitting mechanism to<br>
selectively connect one of the gear members associated with each of the<br>
planetary gear arrangements to each other and to the output member, a second<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism to selectively connect one of the gear members<br>
of the third planetary gear set with ground, a third torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism to selectively connect one of the gear members of the second<br>
planetary gear set with another of the gear members of the second planetary<br>
gear set, a first interconnecting member continuously connecting one of the<br>
members of the first planetary gear set with one of the members of the second<br>
planetary gear set, and a second interconnecting member continuously<br>
connecting one of the members of the second planetary gear set with one of<br>
the members of the third planetary gear set. The at least one processor is<br>
configured to, responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor being<br><br>
below a first torque level, provide a signal controlling the power inverter to set<br>
a switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, provide a signal controlling the<br>
power inverter to determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a<br>
function of the commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the<br>
switching frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The system reduces<br>
switching frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while<br>
maintaining the switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that<br>
provides effective control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus<br>
improves the efficiency of the system.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0016] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0017] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, "connected" means that one element/feature is directly joined to (or<br>
directly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means<br>
that one element/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. However, it should be understood that although two elements<br>
may be described below, in one embodiment, as being "connected," in<br>
alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled," and vice versa.<br>
Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict example<br>
arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features,<br>
or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should also be<br>
understood that the figures are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to<br>
scale.<br>
[0018] The figures illustrate a method and a system for controlling a<br>
power inverter in an electric drive system of an automobile. The system<br>
includes a prime mover power source and a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission, including first and second motors, coupled to<br>
the prime mover power source, a power inverter coupled to the first and<br>
second motors, and at least one processor coupled to the first and second<br>
motors and the power inverter. In general, the system and method controls the<br>
power inverter by, responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor<br>
being below a first torque level, controlling the power inverter to set a<br>
switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br><br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The method reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 30, or "automobile," according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 30 includes a chassis<br>
32, a body 34, four wheels 36, and an electronic control system 38. The body<br>
34 is arranged on the chassis 32 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 30. The body 34 and the chassis 32 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 36 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 32<br>
near a respective corner of the body 34.<br>
[0020] The automobile 30 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The vehicle 30 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a<br>
number of different types of engines (or actuators), such as, for example, a<br>
gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV)<br>
engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound<br>
(e.g., hydrogen and/or natural gas) fueled engine or fuel cell energy source, a<br>
combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0021] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
30 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 40, a battery<br>
(or other electrical energy storage) 42, a power inverter (or inverter) 44, and a<br>
radiator 46. The actuator assembly 40 includes a combustion engine 48 and an<br>
electric motor/generator (or motor) 50.    The electric motor 50 is, in one<br><br>
embodiment, a sinusoidally-wound alternating current (AC) motor (e.g.,<br>
permanent magnet or induction) such as commonly used in automotive<br>
vehicles (e.g., traction drive control systems, and the like). As will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric motor 50 may include a<br>
transmission therein, and although not illustrated also includes a stator<br>
assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The stator assembly<br>
and/or the rotor assembly within the electric motor 50 may include multiple<br>
(e.g., twelve) electromagnetic poles, as is commonly understood.<br>
[0022] Still referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment, the combustion engine<br>
48 and the electric motor 50 are integrated such that both are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 36 through one or more drive shafts 52.<br>
The radiator 46 is connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and<br>
although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple cooling channels<br>
therethough that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or<br>
ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and is coupled to the engine 48 and the<br>
inverter 44. Referring again to FIG. 1, in the depicted embodiment, the<br>
inverter 44 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 50. The<br>
radiator 46 may be similarly connected to the inverter 44 and/or the electric<br>
motor 50.<br>
[0023] The electronic control system 38 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 40, the battery 42, and the inverter 44. Although<br>
not shown in detail, the electronic control system 38 includes various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below.<br>
[0024] Referring to FIG. 2, a voltage source inverter system (or electric<br>
drive system) 54 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention.   The voltage source inverter system 54 includes a<br><br>
controller 56, the inverter 44 coupled to an output of the controller 56, and the<br>
motor 50 coupled to a first output of the inverter 44. The controller 56 and<br>
may be integral with the electronic control system 38 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[00251 FIG. 3 illustrates the inverter 44 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail.<br>
The inverter 44 includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the motor 50. More<br>
specifically, the inverter 44 includes a switch network having a first input<br>
coupled to a voltage source Vdc (e.g., the battery 42) and an output coupled to<br>
the motor 50.<br>
[0026] The switch network comprises three pairs of series switches with<br>
antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch) corresponding to each of<br>
the phases. Each of the pairs of series switches comprises a first switch (or<br>
transistor) 60, 62, and 64 having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode<br>
of the voltage source 42 and a second switch 66, 68, and 70 having a second<br>
terminal coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 42 and having a<br>
first terminal coupled to a second terminal of the respective first switch 60, 62,<br>
and 64.<br>
[0027] FIG. 4 illustrates the powertrain transmission 110 within the<br>
automobile 30 (FIG. 1), according to an exemplary embodiment. The depicted<br>
embodiment is a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical (or hybrid)<br>
transmission. The hybrid transmission 110 has an input member 112 that may<br>
be in the nature of a shaft which may be directly driven by the combustion<br>
engine 48. A transient torque damper may be incorporated between an output<br>
shaft 118 of the engine 48 and the input member 112 of the hybrid<br>
transmission 110. An example of a transient torque damper of the type<br>
recommended for the present usage is disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,009,301 which issued on Apr. 23, 1991 to General Motors Corporation,<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The transient torque<br>
damper may incorporate, or be employed in conjunction with, a torque transfer<br>
device 120 to permit selective engagement of the engine 48 with the hybrid<br>
transmission 110, but it should be understood that the torque transfer device<br><br>
120 is not utilized to change, or control, the mode in which the hybrid<br>
transmission 110 operates.<br>
[0028]       In the embodiment depicted, the engine 48 (or prime mover power<br>
source) may be a fossil fuel engine, such as a diesel engine that is readily<br>
adapted to provide its available power output delivered at a constant number<br>
of revolutions per minute (RPM). Irrespective of the means by which the<br>
engine 48 is connected to the input member 112 of the transmission 110, the<br>
input member 112 is connected to a planetary gear set 124 in the transmission<br>
110.<br>
[0029]       The hybrid transmission 110 utilizes three planetary gear sets (or<br>
arrangements) 124, 126, and 128. The first planetary gear set 124 has an outer<br>
gear member 130 that may generally be designated as the ring gear, which<br>
circumscribes an inner gear member 132, generally designated as the sun gear.<br>
A plurality of planet gear members 134 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 136<br>
such that each planet gear member 134 meshingly engages both the outer gear<br>
member 130 and the inner gear member 132.<br>
[0030]       The second planetary gear set 126 also has an outer gear member<br>
138, generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear<br>
member 140, generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gear<br>
members 142 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 144 such that each planet gear<br>
142 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 138 and the inner gear<br>
member 140.<br>
[0031]       The third planetary gear set 128 also has an outer gear member<br>
146, generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear<br>
member 148, generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gear<br>
members 150 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 152 such that each planet gear<br>
150 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 146 and the inner gear<br>
member 148.<br>
[0032]       In one embodiment, the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the first<br>
planetary gear set 124 is 65/33, the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the second<br><br>
planetary gear set 126 is 65/33, and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the<br>
third planetary gear set 128 is 94/34.<br>
[0033] While all three planetary gear sets 124, 126 and 128 are "simple"<br>
planetary gear sets in their own right, the first and second planetary gear sets<br>
124 and 126 are compounded in that the inner gear member 132 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 124 is conjoined, as through a hub plate gear 154, to the<br>
outer gear member 138 of the second planetary gear set 126. The conjoined<br>
inner gear member 132 of the first planetary gear set 124 and the outer gear<br>
member 138 of the second planetary gear set 126 are continuously connected<br>
to a first motor/generator 156.<br>
[0034] The planetary gear sets 124 and 126 are further compounded in that<br>
the carrier 136 of the first planetary gear set 124 is conjoined, as through a<br>
shaft 160, to the carrier 144 of the second planetary gear set 126. As such,<br>
carriers 136 and 144 of the first and second planetary gear sets 124 and 126,<br>
respectively, are conjoined. The shaft 160 is also selectively connected to the<br>
carrier 152 of the third planetary gear set 128, as through a torque transfer<br>
device 162 which, as will be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to<br>
assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid transmission 110.<br>
[0035] The carrier 152 of the third planetary gear set 128 is connected<br>
directly to the transmission output member 164. When the hybrid transmission<br>
110 is used in a land vehicle, the output member 164 may be connected to the<br>
vehicular axles (not shown) that may, in turn, terminate in the drive shafts 52<br>
(shown in FIG. I).<br>
[0036] The inner gear member 140 of the second planetary gear set 126 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 148 of the third planetary gear set 128, as<br>
through a sleeve shaft 166 that circumscribes shaft 160. The outer gear<br>
member 146 of the third planetary gear set 128 is selectively connected to<br>
ground, represented by the transmission housing 168, through a torque transfer<br>
device 170. The torque transfer device 170, as is also hereinafter explained, is<br>
also employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid<br>
transmission 110. The sleeve shaft 166 is also continuously connected to a<br><br>
second motor/generator 172. All the planetary gear sets 124, 126 and 128 as<br>
well as the two motor/generators 156 and 172 are coaxially oriented, as about<br>
the axially disposed shaft 160. It should be noted that both motor/generators<br>
156 and 172 are of an annular configuration which permits them to<br>
circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 124, 126 and 128 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 124, 126 and 128 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
motor/generators 156 and 172. This configuration assures that the overall<br>
envelope—i.e., the circumferential dimension—of the transmission 110 is<br>
minimized.<br>
[0037] A torque transfer device 173 selectively connects the sun gear 140<br>
with ground (i.e., with transmission housing 168). A torque transfer device<br>
175 is operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 124, 126,<br>
motors 156, 172 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting<br>
the sun gear 140 with the carrier 144. The torque transfer devices 162, 170,<br>
173, 175 are all friction clutches.<br>
[0038] As was previously herein explained in conjunction with the<br>
description of the engine 48, it should similarly be understood that the<br>
rotational speed and horsepower output of the first and second<br>
motor/generators 156 and 172 are also not critical to the invention, but for the<br>
purpose of effecting an absolutely clear understanding of the hybrid<br>
transmission 110, the motors/generators 156 and 172 have a continuous rating<br>
of 30 horsepower and a maximum speed of approximately 10200 RPM. The<br>
continuous power rating is approximately 1/10 that of the engine 48, and the<br>
maximum speed is approximately 1.5x that of the engine 48, although these<br>
depend on the type of engine, final gear schematic and duty cycle.<br>
[0039] As should be apparent from the foregoing description, and with<br>
particular reference to FIG. 2, the transmission 110 selectively receives power<br>
from the engine 48. As will now be explained, the hybrid transmission 110<br>
also receives power from the battery 42, the ECU 38 via transfer conductors<br>
178A and 178B. The ECU 38 communicates with the first motor/generator<br>
156 by transfer conductors  178C and  I78D, and the ECU 38 similarly<br><br>
communicates with the second motor/generator 172 by transfer conductors<br>
178Eand I78F.<br>
[0040] As apparent from the previous paragraph, a particular structural<br>
member, component or arrangement may be employed at more than one<br>
location. When referring generally to that type of structural member,<br>
component or arrangement, a common numerical designation will be<br>
employed. However, when one of the structural members, components or<br>
arrangements so identified is to be individually identified, it will be referenced<br>
by virtue of a letter suffix employed in combination with the numerical<br>
designation employed for general identification of that structural member,<br>
component or arrangement. Thus, there are at least six transfer conductors<br>
which are generally identified by the numeral 178, but the specific, individual<br>
transfer conductors are, therefore, identified as 178A, 178B, 178C, 178D,<br>
178E and 178F in the specification and on the drawings. This same suffix<br>
convention shall be employed throughout the specification.<br>
[0041] A drive gear 180 may be presented from the input member 112. As<br>
depicted, the drive gear 180 fixedly connects the input member 112 to the<br>
outer gear member 130 of the first planetary gear set 124, and the drive gear<br>
180, therefore, receives power from the engine 48 and/or the motor/generators<br>
156 and/or 172. The drive gear 180 meshingly engages an idler gear 182<br>
which, in turn, meshingly engages a transfer gear 184 that is secured to one<br>
end of a shaft 186. The other end of the shaft 186 may be secured to a<br>
transmission fluid pump and/or PTO unit, designated either individually or<br>
collectively at 188.<br>
[0042] The ECU 38 obtains information from both the first and second<br>
motor/generators 156 and 172, respectively, the engine 48 and the battery 42.<br>
In response to an operator's action, or "operator demand" (e.g., from a drive<br>
range selector, an accelerator pedal, and/or a brake pedal), the ECU 38<br>
determines what is required and then manipulates the selectively operated<br>
components of the hybrid transmission 110 appropriately to respond to the<br>
operator demand.<br><br>
[0043] For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 4, when<br>
the operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the<br>
accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the ECU 38 determines if the vehicle<br>
should accelerate or decelerate. The ECU 38 also monitors the state of the<br>
power sources and determines the output of the transmission required to affect<br>
the desired rate of acceleration or deceleration. Under the direction of the<br>
ECU 38, the transmission is capable of providing a range of output speeds<br>
from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0044] The transmission 110 operates as a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical, vehicular transmission. In other words, the output<br>
member 164 receives power through two distinct gear trains within the<br>
transmission 110. A first mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque<br>
transfer device 170 is actuated in order to "ground" the outer gear member 146<br>
of the third planetary gear set 128. A second mode, or gear train, is selected<br>
when the torque transfer device 170 is released and the torque transfer device<br>
162 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 160 to the carrier 152 of<br>
the third planetary gear set 128.<br>
[0045] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ECU 38 serves to<br>
provide a range of output speeds from relatively slow to relatively fast within<br>
each mode of operation. This combination of two modes with a slow to fast<br>
output speed range in each mode allows the transmission 110 to propel a<br>
vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds. Additionally, the ECU<br>
38 coordinates operation of the transmission 110 so as to allow synchronized<br>
shifts between the modes.<br>
[0046] First and second "modes" of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch (e.g., clutch 162<br>
or clutch 170), and the controlled speed and torque of the motor/generators<br>
156 and 172, all as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,301 which issued on Apr.<br>
23, 1991 to General Motors Corporation. Also, certain "ranges" of operation<br>
may be achieved by applying an additional clutch (e.g., clutch 162, 173 or<br>
175).<br><br>
[0047] When the additional clutch is applied (i.e., when two clutching<br>
mechanisms are applied), a fixed input to output speed ratio (i.e., a fixed gear<br>
ratio) is achieved, as illustrated in the truth table of FIG. 5. The rotations of<br>
the motor/generators 156 and 172 will then be dependent on internal rotation<br>
of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input<br>
speed. The motor/generators 156 and 172 are completely independent of<br>
engine to output power flow, thereby enabling both to be motors, both to<br>
function as generators, or any combination thereof. This allows, for instance,<br>
during acceleration in the first fixed ratio that the engine power and both units<br>
functioning as motors accepting power from the battery 42 to be additive into<br>
propelling the vehicle through third planetary gear set 128 to the output 164.<br>
[0048] It also should be noted that the function of the transmission can at<br>
any time be switched from operation in fixed ratio to mode control by<br>
actuating the additional clutch (i.e., on or off) during a mode of operation.<br>
Determination of operation in fixed ratio or mode control is by algorithms in<br>
the ECU 38 controlling the transmission.<br>
[0049] Additionally, the modes of operation may overlap the fixed ratios<br>
of operation. Selection of the mode or fixed ratio depends again on the<br>
driver's input and response of the vehicle thereto. In one embodiment, the first<br>
range falls within the first mode of operation when Cl and C4 (i.e., clutches<br>
170 and 175) are engaged, and the second range falls within the first mode of<br>
operation when C2 and Cl (clutches 162 and 170) are engaged. As illustrated<br>
in FIG. 5, a third fixed ratio range is available during the second mode of<br>
operation when C2 and C4 (clutches 162 and 175) are engaged, and a fourth<br>
fixed ratio range is available during the second mode of operation when C2<br>
and C3 (clutches 162 and 173) are engaged.<br>
[0050] In the first mode of operation, and when the ECU 38 has<br>
determined that the operator desires to move forwardly from a stationary<br>
condition, and to accelerate, the torque transfer device 120 is engaged<br>
operatively to connect the engine 48 to the hybrid transmission 110. The<br>
torque transfer device 120 remains applied as the vehicle moves forwardly<br><br>
through a speed range hereinafter more fully described. The torque transfer<br>
device 162 is not applied and remains disengaged, while the torque transfer<br>
device 170 is engaged. In this situation, the engine 48 applies driving power<br>
to the outer gear member 130 of the first planetary gear set 124 such that the<br>
outer member 130 rotates in unison with the input member 112 (and thus the<br>
engine 48). The first motor/generator 156 simultaneously rotates the inner<br>
gear member 132 of the first planetary gear set 124 and the outer gear member<br>
138 of the second planetary gear set 126 in the same direction, thus driving the<br>
carrier 136 in the same direction, which effects rotation of the inner gear<br>
member 140 of the second planetary gear set 124.<br>
[0051] The second motor/generator 172 operates as a motor during the<br>
first mode, and as such drives sleeve shaft 166 in a direction which causes the<br>
inner gear member 148 of the third planetary gear set 128 to rotate the planet<br>
gears 150 of the third planetary gear set 128 against the outer gear member<br>
146 of the third planetary gear set 128. The outer gear member 146 is fixed by<br>
having been grounded so that the carrier 152 drives the output member 164 in<br>
a direction required to effect forward movement of the vehicle.<br>
[0052] The rotation of the sleeve shaft 166 affected by rotation of the<br>
second motor/generator 172 operating as a motor also rotates the inner gear<br>
member 140 of the second planetary gear set 126. Because the torque transfer<br>
device 162 remains disengaged, the carriers 136 and 144 of the first and<br>
second planetary gear sets 124 and 126, respectively, are freely rotatable, but<br>
only in unison inasmuch as the two carriers 136 and 144 are compounded. As<br>
a result, the rotation of the outer gear member 130 of the first planetary gear<br>
set 124 caused by the engine 48 and the rotation of the inner gear member 140<br>
caused by the second motor/generator 172 force the inner gear member 132 of<br>
the first planetan gear set 124 and the conjoined outer gear member 138 of the<br>
second planetan gear set 126 to drive the first motor/generator 156 in that<br>
direction (and with that velocity), which causes the first motor/generator 56, at<br>
least initially, to serve as a generator.<br><br>
[0053] In one mode, the transmission operates in the first mode from rest<br>
(i.e., the vehicle is not moving) to about 70 MPH. At speeds greater than<br>
about 70 MPH the transmission operates in the second mode.<br>
[0054] Fixed gear ratios can also be selected, overlapping the operation of<br>
the modes, to further improve acceleration by increasing the power reaching<br>
the output 164 and/or to improve efficiency.<br>
[0055] At about 70 MPH, the lock-up clutch 175 is engaged while the<br>
clutch 170 remains engaged. In this configuration, the transmission 110 is<br>
engaged in the first fixed ratio as defined by the third planetary gear set 128,<br>
as shown FIG. 5. When the clutch 175 is engaged, the first two gear sets 124<br>
and 126 and motor/generators 156 and 172 rotate at the input speed and are<br>
connected with the sun gear 148 of the third planetary gear set 128. With the<br>
clutch 170 also engaged there is a speed reduction provided by the third<br>
planetary gear set 128 which results in torque being multiplied. All power is<br>
transmitted mechanically through the planetary gear sets (i.e., no torque is<br>
present in the motors/generators 156 and 172), which minimizes electrical<br>
losses and provides higher efficiency operation. However, with full torque<br>
applied in the first and second motor/generators 156 and 172, a significant<br>
increase in performance can be realized. With both motors locked together by<br>
device 175, the first and second motor/generators 156 and 172 can also share<br>
equally any regenerative power, resulting in higher braking performance with<br>
improved cooling. Only the third planetary gear set 128 is active because the<br>
torque transmitting device (or lock-up clutch) 175 locks up the first and<br>
second planetary gear sets 124 and 126. Engagement of the torque<br>
transmitting device 175 also protects the motor/generators 156 and 172 if the<br>
power flow necessary for power split operation would overload the<br>
motor/generators. Therefore, if the vehicle is towing or hauling up a hill, the<br>
motors/generators are protected.<br>
[0056] During normal operation, only the clutch 170 would be engaged at<br>
low speeds, but if maximum power is demanded, the lock-up clutch 175 is<br>
also engaged. The first and second motors 156 and 172 may be activated with<br><br>
the clutch 175 to achieve maximum available horsepower. This clutch also<br>
provides the ability for all three of the engine 48 and motor/generators 156 and<br>
172 to simultaneously propel the vehicle for maximum acceleration.<br>
[0057] In one embodiment, at about 40 MPH, the lock-up clutch 175 is<br>
disengaged. Thereafter, the second motor/generator 172 operates as a motor.<br>
The first motor/generator 156 operates as a generator up to a point at which<br>
the first motor/generator 156 is stationary (e.g., approximately 52 MPH). The<br>
motor/generator 156 then reverses direction and operates as a motor.<br>
[0058] The clutch 162 is engaged at, for example, about 57 MPH. With<br>
the clutches 162 and 170 engaged, a second fixed ratio is achieved (e.g., 1.7:1<br>
as shown in FIG. 5). During the second fixed ratio, all three gear sets 124,<br>
126, and 128 are active. The motor/generators 156 and 172 may be turned off<br>
during the engagement of the clutches 162 and 170 for fully mechanical<br>
operation. During the second fixed ratio, the motors 156 and 172 may spin<br>
freely with no torque being present. The first mode ends when the clutch 170<br>
is turned off and the clutch 162 remains engaged for the high-efficiency<br>
second mode of operation.<br>
[0059] In the above description, the transmission mode I as described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,301 is supplemented with the ability to launch in mode I,<br>
shift to fixed ratio 1, return to mode I, and then to fixed ratio 2. The actual<br>
operation in the vehicle is determined by inputs to the ECU 38. The<br>
transmission ma\ be operated in only mode I, or any combination as necessary<br>
to improve efficiency, performance, or braking power.<br>
[0060] In an exemplary embodiment, the outer gear members 130 and 138<br>
in each of the first and second planetary gear sets 124 and 126 have 65 teeth,<br>
and the inner gear members 132 and 140 in each of the first and second<br>
planetary gear sets 124 and 126 have 33 teeth. The outer gear member 146 of<br>
the third planetary gear set 128 has 94 teeth, and the inner gear member 148 of<br>
the third planetary gear set 128 has 34 teeth. With the configuration of the<br>
transmission 110 heretofore described, and with the aforesaid number of teeth<br>
on the inner and outer gear members, the transmission provides a mechanical<br><br>
point (i.e., at about 50 MPH) while operating in the first mode, at which the<br>
first motor/generator 56 has a zero rotational speed. To complete the<br>
description as to the operation of the motor/generators in the exemplary<br>
environment described, one must consider operation of the transmission in the<br>
second mode of operation.<br>
[0061] The transition from the first (mode I) to the second mode (mode II)<br>
of operation is achieved by disengaging the torque transfer device 170 and<br>
continuing the application of the torque transfer device 162. In a manner<br>
similar to the previously described first mode, the second mode overlaps fixed<br>
ratios as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
[0062J At the inception of the second mode of operation, the first<br>
motor/generator 156 transitions from operating as a motor to operating as a<br>
generator. The first motor/generator 156 continues to operate as a generator<br>
during operation of the transmission 110 in the second mode while the vehicle<br>
gains speed from, for example, about 70 MPH to about 88 MPH. At about 88<br>
MPH, the first motor/generator 156 transitions from operation as a generator<br>
back to operation as a motor as it transitions through a mechanical point<br>
wherein the motor/generator 156 has zero rotational speed. The first<br>
motor/generator 156 continues thereafter to operate as a motor.<br>
[0063] At the beginning of the second mode of operation, the second<br>
motor/generator 172 continues to operate as a motor. In fact, the second<br>
motor/generator 172 operates as a motor until the vehicle reaches a speed of<br>
about 88 MPH, at which point it transitions to operation as a generator, and<br>
continues thereafter to operate as a generator.<br>
[0064] With the configuration of the transmission 110 heretofore<br>
described, and with the aforesaid number of teeth on the inner and outer gear<br>
members, the transmission 110 provides two mechanical points while<br>
operating in the second mode. That is, in one embodiment, the first<br>
motor/generator 156 has a zero rotational speed at about 88 MPH, and the<br>
second motor/generator 172 has a zero rotational speed at about 208 MPH.<br><br>
[0065]       As illustrated in FIG. 5, third and fourth fixed ratios are available<br>
during the second mode. The third fixed ratio may be established with the<br>
simultaneous engagement of the clutches 162 and 175, which locks all gear<br>
sets into a 1:1 ratio so that the output 164 rotates at the same speed as the input<br>
112.<br>
[0066]       The fourth fixed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
clutches 162 and 173 to provide a fixed overdrive ratio of 0.74:1, as shown in<br>
FIG. 2.  In the fourth fixed ratio, the first and second planetary gear sets 124<br>
and 126 are active, and the motors/generators 156 and 172 may freewheel with<br>
no torque present.<br>
[0067]       Accordingly,  the transmission   110  provides three mechanical<br>
points and four available fixed ratios, thereby minimizing electrical losses in<br>
the motors/generators while providing maximum power quickly in the first<br>
mode via the lock-up clutch 175.<br>
[0068]       It should be understood that the exact location of the aforesaid<br>
mechanical points is determined not only by the number of teeth on the inner<br>
and outer gear members of the planetary gear sets, but also by the rotational<br>
speed of the input shaft 112. Hence, with the number of teeth disclosed for the<br>
inner and outer gear members in the exemplary embodiment, an increase in<br>
the speed of the input shaft 112 will shift the locations of the mechanical<br>
points to higher vehicular speeds, and conversely, a reduction in the speed of<br>
the input member 112 will shift the mechanical points to lower vehicular<br>
speeds.<br>
[0069]       The reverse mode of operation is effected by having the ECU 38<br>
operate the second motor/generator 172 as a motor, but reversing its rotational<br>
direction from the direction in which the second motor/generator 172 rotates<br>
when the vehicle begins to move forwardly from a stationary position in the<br>
first mode of operation.<br>
[0070]       Thus,    the    two-mode,    compound-split,     electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 110 uses a lock-up clutch and provides four available mechanical<br>
points. It enables maximum power to be reached more quickly for towing and<br><br>
hauling, and enables the use of smaller electrical components. By providing<br>
fixed ratios in an electrically variable transmission, maximum fuel economy is<br>
achieved at a reasonable cost.<br>
[0071] The lock-up clutch 175 shown schematically between the planet<br>
carrier 144 and the sun gear 140 may also be located to connect the ring gear<br>
138 and the sun gear 140 and will provide the same lockup function.<br>
Alternatively, the lock-up clutch 175 may connect the sun gear 140 and ring<br>
gear 148 of the second planetary gear set 126. As a further alternative, the<br>
lock-up clutch 175 may connect the carrier 136 and ring gear 130 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 124.<br>
[0072] During operation, again referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle 30 is<br>
operated by providing power to the wheels 36 with the combustion engine 48<br>
and the electric motor 50 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion<br>
engine 48 and the electric motor 50 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor 50, DC power is provided from the battery 42 to the inverter 44,<br>
which converts the DC power into AC power, before the power is sent to the<br>
electric motor 50. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the<br>
conversion of DC power to AC power is substantially performed by operating<br>
(i.e., repeatedly switching) the transistors within the inverter 44 at a<br>
"switching frequency".<br>
[0073] Generally, the controller 56 produces a signal for controlling the<br>
switching action of the inverter 44. As one example, the controller 56<br>
produces a discontinuous PWM (DPWM) signal having a single zero vector<br>
associated with each switching cycle of the inverter 44. The inverter 44 then<br>
converts the PWM signal to a modulated voltage waveform for operating the<br>
motor 50. In a preferred embodiment, the controller 56 produces a PWM<br>
signal that controls the power inverter 44 to maintain the switching frequency<br>
of the power inverter 44 at a first, relatively high, set frequency responsive to a<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor 50 being below a first level. The<br>
controller 56 furthermore produces a PWM signal that controls the power<br>
inverter to provide a signal controlling the power inverter to determine the<br><br>
switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the commanded<br>
torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching frequency above<br>
a dynamic frequency limit, when the commanded torque is between the first<br>
and second levels.<br>
[0074] This configuration of the drive system ensures good control and<br>
efficient use of power in the electric motor drive system. Specifically, the<br>
switching frequency of a PWM inverter affects the power losses in<br>
semiconductor switches. Thus, lowering the switching frequency can reduce<br>
power losses. However, at higher motor speeds, a higher switching frequency<br>
is desirable to maintain an adequate pulse ratio for precise controllability of<br>
the electric motor. Additionally, it is desirable to maintain the switching<br>
frequency above levels that cause excessive noise emissions. Third, the<br>
switching frequency affects the maximum controllable stator fundamental<br>
frequency. Fourth, the switching frequency can affect the phase ripple current,<br>
which can affect losses in both the inverter and motor. Additionally, the ripple<br>
current can cause unwanted torque ripple in the drive.<br>
[0075] The inverter switching losses can be roughly described in equation<br>
1. Specifically, equation 1 shows of switching losses Psw are proportionate to<br>
voltage Vdc, phase current IPh and switching frequency fsw.<br><br>
[0076] Thus, to maintain constant switching losses the switching<br>
frequency could be adjusted to be inversely proportional to the phase current.<br>
Since the phase current is roughly proportional to the motor torque (in the<br>
unsaturated case, and below base speed), phase current can be roughly equated<br>
to motor torque. Thus, adjusting the switching frequency as a function<br>
inversely proportional to motor torque will tend to maintain constant switching<br>
losses in the semiconductor devices<br>
[0077] Furthermore, acoustic noise can be generated by the motor due to<br>
the switching frequency.    In general, the human ear is most sensitive to<br><br>
frequencies in the range of 1 kHz to 5 kHz. Thus, to minimize acoustic noise<br>
it is desirable to operate inverter at a much higher range, for example 8 kHz.<br>
[0078J In general, the fundamental electrical frequency (fe) of an electric<br>
motor is proportional to motor speed. To control the stator currents in a stable<br>
manner, the ratio of switching frequency to fundamental electrical frequency<br>
needs to remain sufficiently high. This ratio is sometimes referred to as a<br>
pulse ratio. For example, in some typical motor controls a pulse ratio of about<br>
10:1 is needed to guarantee stable operation. Thus, it is desirable to maintain<br>
the switching frequency above a level that prevents the pulse ratio from<br>
dropping below the amount needed to guarantee stable operation.<br>
[0079] There are thus conflicting goals with respect to the switching<br>
frequency. The embodiments of the invention are configured to control the<br>
switching frequency to be at high value to reduce acoustic noise and improve<br>
control at high speeds and low torque, and then reduce the switching<br>
frequency at high torque and current to reduce power loss and protect<br>
semiconductor switches from thermal overstress.<br>
[0080] Returning to FIGS. 1-3, the controller 56 is thus configured to<br>
produce a PWM signal that controls the power inverter 44 to maintain the<br>
switching frequency of the power inverter 44 at a first, relatively high, set<br>
frequency responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor 50 being<br>
below a first level. The controller 56 furthermore produces a PWM signal that<br>
controls the power inverter to provide a signal controlling the power inverter<br>
to determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit, when the commanded torque is<br>
between the first and second levels.<br>
[0081] In general, the first set frequency is set at a relatively high level<br>
that provides good control over the electric motor 50, without exceeding the<br>
frequency response of the switches in the inverter 44, or causing excessive<br>
heat due to switching losses. For example, in some embodiments the first set<br>
frequency will comprise a switching frequency of 8 kHz.<br><br>
[0082] At intermediate motor speeds, the inverter 44 is operated with the<br>
switching frequency that varies as a function of torque. In general, the<br>
switching frequency is reduced as commanded torque increases, and a variety<br>
of functional relationships between switching frequency and torque can be<br>
used to accomplish this. For example, the relationship between switching<br>
frequency and torque can be linear, non-linear or any combination thereof<br>
during intermediate motor speeds.<br>
[0083]       As stated above, during operation of the electric motor 50 the<br>
switching frequency is varied as a function of commanded torque.  However,<br>
at the same time, the operation of the inverter 44 is controlled to ensure that<br>
the switching frequency is maintained above a dynamic frequency limit.   In<br>
general, the dynamic frequency limit itself varies with, and is responsive to<br>
motor speed. The dynamic frequency limit is preferably implemented to allow<br>
a sufficient reduction in switching frequency to reduce power losses while<br>
maintaining a high enough switching frequency to maintain good current<br>
control at the motors present speed. Furthermore, the dynamic frequency limit<br>
is preferably selected to limit acoustic noise to acceptable levels.<br>
[0084]       In one embodiment, the dynamic frequency limit is a function of<br>
motor speed when the electric motor is being operated at intermediate speeds,<br>
i.e., bet-veen a first speed level and a second speed level.   Then, when the<br>
motor speed is below first speed level, the dynamic frequency limit is<br>
maintained at a relatively low specified, set frequency.<br>
[0085]       For example, the dynamic frequency limit can be selected to<br>
njaintain a specified pulse ratio during operation of the electric motor, where<br>
the pulse ratio is generally defined as a ratio of switching frequency to<br>
fundamental frequency.    As the fundamental frequency is related to motor<br>
speed, configuring the dynamic limit to maintain a specified pulse ratio<br>
effectively determines the dynamic frequency limit as a function of motor<br>
speed. Maintaining a high pulse ratio assures a sufficient amount of cycles in<br>
the inverter 44 to provide accurate control over the current in the electric<br>
motor 50.   Thus, the dynamic frequency limit is implemented to make sure<br><br>
that as motor speed increases, the frequency limit also increases to ensure that<br>
effective motor control is maintained.<br>
[0086] Additionally, the dynamic frequency limit can be set to operate at a<br>
relatively high frequency limit when the electric motor is operated at speeds<br>
above the second speed level. In one specific embodiment, this high<br>
frequency limit can be same frequency the inverter is operated at low torque<br>
levels (e.g., 8 kHz ).<br>
[0087] Turning now to FIG. 6, a graphical representation 400 of an<br>
exemplar)' switching frequency control scheme is illustrated. In this<br>
representation, the plot of the switching frequency as a function of the torque<br>
command is illustrated for motor speed values of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and<br>
800 RPM. Below a first torque value of m1 (e.g., 100 Nm), the switching<br>
frequency is held to a predetermined maximum value (e.g., 8 kHz) regardless<br>
of motor speed. As the torque command exceeds the first value, the switching<br>
frequency is reduced inversely proportional to torque while maintaining the<br>
switching frequency above a dynamic frequency limit.<br>
[0088] The dynamic frequency limit itself varies with, and is responsive to<br>
motor speed. This causes the separate plots for each of the illustrated motor<br>
speed values. In the representation of FIG. 6, the dynamic frequency limit is a<br>
function of motor speed when the electric motor is being operated at<br>
intermediate speeds, i.e., between a first speed level and a second speed level.<br>
Then, when the motor speed is below first speed level, the dynamic frequency<br>
limit is maintained at a relatively low specified, set frequency of 1 kHz.<br>
[0089] Turning now to FIG. 7, a graphical representation 500 of an<br>
exemplary dynamic frequency limit scheme is illustrated. This is an example<br>
of the type of representation, that when used with function to control<br>
switching frequency as a function of torque, results in switching frequency<br>
values illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
[0090] In the representation 500, the dynamic limit of the switching<br>
frequency is plotted as function of motor speed. At low motor speeds below<br>
speed n1 (e.g., 100 RPM), the dynamic limit of the switching frequency will be<br><br>
held at a preset low set frequency (fs»_min_hm)- This level is selected to maintain<br>
good control while avoiding excessive acoustic noise and power loss, and is<br>
set at 1 kHz in this example. Of course, this is just one example, and other<br>
limit values could also be used.<br>
[0091] At intermediate motor speeds (between n1 and n2 (e.g., 800 RPM))<br>
the switching frequency of the inverter will be determined as function of<br>
motor speed. In the illustrated embodiment, the function is configured to<br>
maintain a desired minimum pulse ratio (N) between the switching frequency<br>
(fsw) and the fundamental frequency (fe). During operation of the electric<br>
motor, the switching frequency of the inverters is operated as a function of<br>
commanded torque, reducing the switching frequency as the commanded<br>
torque is increased, while the switching frequency is maintained above<br>
dynamic frequency limit that is dependent on motor speed. Stated another<br>
way, motor speed determines the minimum possible switching frequency, with<br>
the torque command slewing the actual switching frequency between the<br>
maximum and the speed dependent minimum frequencies. Thus, the<br>
operational range of switching frequency fsw is illustrated in FIG. 7 as the<br>
hatched area above the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min and below the<br>
maximum set switching frequency of fsw_mxa. It should be noted, that above<br>
speeds of n2, the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min and the maximum frequency<br>
fsw_ max converge, and thus the motor will operate at the maximum switching<br>
frequency fsw_max above speeds of n2 regardless of torque.<br>
[0092] It should again be noted that the RPM values of n1 and n2, and the<br>
frequency values of fsw_max and fSw_mm_lim, and the slope and/or function of the<br>
dynamic frequency limit fsw_min are merely exemplary, and that other values<br>
and functions could be used depending on the details of the application.<br>
[0093] Another exemplary illustration of the techniques for determining<br>
the switching frequency are illustrated in Equation 2.<br><br><br>
[0094] In equation 2, the switching frequency is determined as a function<br>
of the commanded torque m* while being maintained above a dynamic<br>
frequency limit fsw min. If the commanded torque is less than a torque level m1,<br>
the switching frequency is set to the maximum frequency fsw_max- If the<br>
commanded torque above a torque level m2, the switching frequency fsw is<br>
reduced down to the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min- At intermediate torque<br>
values, the switching frequency is a function of torque and the frequency<br>
limits.<br>
[0095] Also shown in the example of equation 2, the dynamic frequency<br>
limit fsw_min is itself a function of motor speed, set equal to fSw_max at speeds<br>
above ni, set equal to a minimum value fSw_min_lim at speeds below n1, and<br>
determined as function of fundamental frequency fe and a desired pulse ratio N<br>
at intermediate speeds.<br>
[0096] Again, the values selected for these various parameters would be<br>
selected based on the needs of a particular application. For example, the<br>
frequency profile may be selected to minimize junction temperature swings for<br>
frequent operating points, in order to extend the lifetime of the devices. For<br>
example, m1 can be selected to maintain fsw at its maximum value during a<br><br>
typical engine crank event, to avoid acoustic noise problems. Also, it should<br>
be noted that equation 2 illustrates just one exemplary function for adjusting<br>
switching frequencies as a function of torque (i.e., inversely proportional).<br>
However, alternate functions could also be used. Likewise, while equation 2<br>
illustrates the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min determined as a linear function<br>
of fundamental frequency fe at intermediate speeds, alternate functions could<br>
also be used.<br>
[0097] The various embodiments thus provide a system and method that<br>
controls the power inverter by, responsive to a commanded torque of the<br>
electric motor being below a first torque level, controlling the power inverter<br>
to set a switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit.  The method reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
