				<td>MOTORCYCLE CLUTCH DEVICE TECI-INICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a clutch device, and more particularly a clutch device for a motorcycle, which transmits power from an input-side member to an output-side member and interrupts the transmission of power by actuation of a release mechanism. BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]   Two-wheeled motor vehicles, ATV's, and other such motorcycles generally come with a multi-plate clutch device for transmitting or interrupting power from the engine to the transmission. This multi-plate clutch device has a clutch housing coupled to the crankshaft side of the engine, an output-side rotating body coupled to the transmission side, a clutch for transmitting and interrupting power between these, and a pressure plate for pressing the clutch. The clutch has first clutch plates that engage with the clutch housing, and second clutch plates that engage with the output-side rotating body, with these being disposed alternately,<br>
[0003]   These clutch plates are pressed by a pressing member such as a spring via the pressure plate, so that the rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted to the transmission side. When the clutch is disengaged (the transmission of power is interrupted), the rider squeezes the clutch lever to actuate a release mechanism, and this release mechanism releases the pressing of the pressing member against the clutch plates, and power transmission between the first and second clutch plates is interrupted.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2003-222159 DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br><br>
[0004]   With a conventional clutch device, lubricating oil is misted and made to spread throughout the clutch device in order to keep the clutch lubricated.<br>
[0005] However, since a number of members are concentrated around the clutch, the misted lubricating oil does not reach the clutch as expected, so the desired lubricating performance is not obtained.<br>
[0006]   It is an object of the present invention to enhance the lubricating performance of a clutch device for a motorcycle.<br>
[0007]   A clutch device according to the first aspect of the present invention is a motorcycle clutch device that transmits power from an input-side member to an output-side member and interrupts the transmission of power by actuation of a release mechanism. This clutch device has a clutch housing, a rotating body, at least one plate member, a pressure plate, and a pressing member. The clutch housing is coupled to either the input-side member or the output-side member. The rotating body is disposed on the inside of the clutch housing and is coupled to the other of the input-side member and the output-side member. The plate member is supported rotatably and movably in the axial direction by either the clutch housing or the rotating body. The pressure plate is disposed near the plate member and is supported rotatably and movably in the axial direction by the other of the clutch housing and the rotating body. The pressing member has a pressing component that presses the pressure plate toward the plate member side, a plurality of levers extending to the inside in the radial direction from the pressing component and disposed in the rotation direction spaced apart from one another, and at least one protrusion extending in the axial direction and the rotation direction from the levers.<br><br>
[0008]    With this clutch device, since protrusions are provided on the levers of the pressing<br>
member, when the entire device rotates, the air around the protrusions is disturbed, and the<br>
surrounding air moves in the axial direction through the gaps between the levers. As a result,<br>
for example, misted lubricating oil that has spread around the device is brought into the<br>
interior of the device along with this air, and therefore reaches the area around the plate<br>
member. Conversely, the protrusions discharge the air inside the device to the outside, and<br>
misted lubricating oil is brought inside the device through another opening, etc.<br>
[0009]   Thus, with this clutch device, because the protrusions are formed on the pressing<br>
member, this forms an air flow within the device that guides the misted lubricating oil to the<br>
friction face of the plate member. This improves lubricating performance.<br>
[0010]   The clutch device according to the second aspect of the present invention is the<br>
device of the first aspect, wherein the protrusions are disposed on the negative side in the<br>
rotation direction of the levers, and extend from the levers toward the rotating body in the<br>
axial direction,<br>
[0011]   The clutch device according to the third aspect of the present invention is the device<br>
of the first aspect, wherein the protrusions are disposed on the positive side in the rotation<br>
direction of the levers, and extend from the levers toward the opposite side from the rotating<br>
body in the axial direction.<br>
[0012]   The clutch device according to the fourth aspect of the present invention is the<br>
device of the second or third aspect, further comprising a channel that connects the spaces<br>
around the protrusions with the space around the friction face of the plate member.<br>
[0013]   The clutch device according to the fifth aspect of the present invention is the device<br><br>
of the fourth aspect, wherein the rotating body has a first portion that is coupled to the other<br>
of the input-side member and the output-side member, and a second portion that extends to<br>
the outside in the radial direction from the first portion. The second portion has a plurality of<br>
holes that go through in the axial direction. The channel includes the holes.<br>
[0014]   The clutch device according to the sixth invention is the device of the fifth aspect,<br>
wherein the channel includes an annular space formed in the axial direction between the<br>
pressure plate and the second portion.<br>

SI opening BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0017]   Overall Configuration<br>
A motorcycle clutch device 100 shown in Figs. 1 to 3 transmits power from the crankshaft of an engine to a transmission, and interrupts power transmission by actuation of a release mechanism. This clutch device 100 is configured such that power transmission is interrupted by pressing a release bearing to the inside in the axial direction (the left side in Fig. 1), and mainly comprises a clutch housing 1, an output-side rotating body 2 (the rotating body), a clutch 3, a pressure plate 4 (the pressing member), a diaphragm spring 5, and a support plate 6. [0018]    Clutch Housing<br><br>
The clutch housing 1 is a member to which power is inputted from the engine, and houses other members inside. More specifically, the clutch housing 1 has a disk component 10 and a cylindrical component 11 that extends outward (to the right in Fig. 1) in the axial direction from the outer peripheral part of the disk component 10, An input gear 13 (input-side member) is mounted on the disk component 10 via a plurality of annular rubber members 12. This input gear 13 meshes with a drive gear (not shown) that is fixed to the crankshaft of the engine. The rubber members 12 are provided to absorb vibrations transmitted from the engine, and may be coil springs or another such elastic member, for example.<br>
[0019]   As shown in Fig. 2, the cylindrical component 11 has a plurality of protrusions 14 that extend outward in the axial direction. The protrusions 14 support first clutch plates 31 (discussed below). Notches 15 are formed between the protrusions 14 In the rotation direction. The notches 15 have the function of allowing the lubricating oil in the clutch housing 1 to escape to the outer peripheral side, or the function of receiving lubricating oil inside the clutch housing 1, and is included in the channel P through which the misted lubricating oil flows. [0020]   Output-side Rotating Body<br>
The output-side rotating body 2 is disposed on the inner peripheral side of the clutch housing 1, and has a cylindrical boss 21, a disk-shaped flange 22 that extends outward in the radial direction from the boss 21, and a cylindrical component 23 that extends inward in the axial direction from the flange 22. [0021]   The boss 21 has a spline 29 that meshes with an input shaft 17 (output-side member)<br><br>
of the transmission. The boss 21 is fixed by a nut 17a on the end of the input shaft 17. [0022]   The flange 22 slides with the first clutch plates 31 (discussed below), and supports the diaphragm spring 5. More specifically, a plurality of first protrusions 25 that extend outward in the axial direction and a plurality of second protrusions 26 that is disposed to the inside of the first protrusions 25 in the radial direction are formed on the outer peripheral part of the flange 22. Tabs 54 on the diaphragm spring 5 are inserted between adjacent first protrusions 25. The second protrusions 26 support a pressing component 51 of the diaphragm spring 5 in the axial direction.<br>
[0023]   The cylindrical component 23 supports a second clutch plate 32 (discussed below) so that it can rotate integrally and move in the axial direction, and has a plurality of external teeth 24 that extend outward in the radial direction. Second protrusions 32b of the second clutch plate 32 are inserted between adjacent external teeth 24.<br>
[0024]   Also, a plurality of holes 27 are formed in the flange 22. Bosses 43 of the pressure plate 4 (discussed below) are inserted via a gap into the holes 27. [0025]   Clutch<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the clutch 3 has the two first clutch plates 31 and the second clutch plate 32 that is disposed between the first clutch plate 31 in the axial direction. [0026]   The first clutch plates 31 are input-side friction members, and are supported by the clutch housing 1 so as to be able to rotate integrally and move in the axial direction. More specifically, the first clutch plates 31 have a first annular component 31a having a friction face, and a plurality of first protrusions 31b that extend outward in the radial direction from the first annular component 31a. The first protrusions 3 lb are inserted between the<br><br>
protrusions 14 of the clutch housing 1. This allows the first clutch plates 31 to transmit power from the clutch housing 1.<br>
[0027]   The second clutch plate 32 is an output-side friction member, and is supported by the output-side rotating body 2 so as to be able to rotate integrally and to move in the axial direction. More specifically, the second clutch plate 32 has a second annular component 32a having a friction face, and a plurality of second protrusions 32b that extend inward in the radial direction from the second annular component 32a. This allows the second clutch plate 32 to transmit power to the output-side rotating body 2.<br>
[0028]   In a state in which power transmission has been interrupted, a slight gap is maintained between the first clutch plates 31 and the second clutch plate 32. This gap is included in the channel P (discussed below). [0029]   Pressure Plate<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the pressure plate 4 is an annular member disposed so as to be opposite the output-side rotating body 2, and is disposed on the outer peripheral side of the boss 21 of the output-side rotating body 2. More specifically, the pressure plate 4 has a disk-shaped pressure plate main body 41 and a plurality of bosses 43 that extend outward in the axial direction from the pressure plate main body 41.<br>
[0030]   The pressure plate main body 41 is supported by the boss 21 of the output-side rotating body 2 so as to be able to move in the axial direction. The outer peripheral part 42 of the pressure plate main body 41 slides with the first clutch plates 31. A plurality of teeth 45 that extend outward in the axial direction are provided to the inner peripheral part of the outer peripheral part. Since the teeth 45 can come Into contact with the external teeth 24 of the<br><br>
output-side rotating body 2 in the rotation direction, the pressure plate 4 rotates integrally<br>
with the output-side rotating body 2.<br>
[0031]   The bosses 43 are inserted in the holes 27 in the output-side rotating body 2, with a<br>
gap in between. The support plate 6 is fixed by bolts 44 to the ends of the bosses 43. As<br>
discussed below, the support plate 6 supports the distal ends of levers 52 of the diaphragm<br>
spring 5 in the axial direction.<br>
[0032]    Diaphragm Spring<br>
The diaphragm spring 5 is disposed in a compressed state between the output-side rotating body 2 and the support plate 6 in the axial direction. The elastic force of the diaphragm spring 5 clamps the clutch 3 between the output-side rotating body 2 and the pressure plate 4,<br>
[0033]   The diaphragm spring 5 has an annular pressing component 51 that functions as a disc spring, and a plurality of levers 52 that extend inward in the radial direction from the pressing component 51.<br>
[0034]   The outer peripheral part of the pressing component 51 is supported in the axial direction by the second protrusions 26 of the output-side rotating body 2. A plurality of tabs 54 that extend outward in the radial direction are formed on the outer peripheral part of the pressing component 51. The tabs 54 come into contact with the first protrusions 25 in the rotation direction. Therefore, the pressing component 51 rotates integrally with the output-side rotating body 2.<br>
[0035]   The plurality of levers 52 are disposed spaced apart in the rotation direction. The distal ends of the levers 52 are supported in the axial direction by support protrusions 61<br><br>
formed at the outer peripheral part of the support plate 6. The pressing component 51 and the<br>
levers 52 are disposed substantially perpendicular to the rotational axis.<br>
[0036]    Furthermore, this diaphragm spring 5 has the function of generating a flow in the<br>
axial direction in the surrounding air. More specifically, the diaphragm spring 5 has a<br>
plurality of fins 53 provided on the levers 52.<br>
[0037]   As shown in Figs. '3 and 4, the fins 53 are plate-shaped portions that extend to the<br>
negative side (the R2 side in Fig. 3) in the rotation direction from the levers 52. The direction<br>
in which the clutch device 100 rotates is the rotation positive direction (the Rl side), and the<br>
opposite side is the negative side in the rotation direction (the R2 side).<br>
[0038]   As shown in Fig. 4, the fins 53 are tilted with respect to the levers 52, and extend<br>
toward the R2 side and inward in the axial direction from the levers 52. Therefore, the distal<br>
ends of the fins 53 come further to the inside in the axial direction than the levers 52.<br>
Openings SI are formed between adjacent levers 52. In this embodiment, these openings SI<br>
are places where air can come in, and are included in the channel P (discussed below).<br>
[0039]    Support Plate<br>
The support plate 6 is an annular member that supports a release bearing (not shown). More specifically, the outer race (not shown) of the release bearing is fitted into the inner peripheral part of the support plate 6. Movement of the release bearing in the axial direction is controlled by a clutch lever (not shown). [0040]   Channel<br>
As mentioned above, the channel P is formed in this clutch device 100 in order to guide the misted lubricating oil from the outside to the clutch 3. More specifically, as shown<br><br>
in Figs. 1 to 4, the channel P is formed mainly by the openings SI in the diaphragm spring 5, the spaces between the holes 27 and the bosses 43, the space formed in the axial direction between the flange 22 and the pressure plate 4, the spaces in the rotation direction between the teeth 45 and the external teeth 24, and the notches 15. Specifically, the space SA on the outside of the clutch device 100 in the axial direction and the space SB on the outer peripheral side are connected by the channel P. [0041]    Basic Operation of Clutch Device<br>
In the state shown in Fig. 1, the pressure plate 4 is pressed by the diaphragm spring 5 at a specific pressing force to the inside in the axial direction, and the first and second clutch plates 31 and 32 of the clutch 3 are sandwiched between the flange 22 of the output-side rotating body 2 and the outer peripheral part 42 of the pressure plate 4 (clutch engaged state). In this state, power inputted from the crankshaft through the input gear 13 and the first clutch plates 31 is transmitted through the clutch housing 1 to the first clutch plates 31, and then through the second clutch plate 32 and the output-side rotating body 2 to the input shaft 17 of the transmission.<br>
[0042]   Meanwhile, when the rider squeezes the clutch lever, the operational force thereof is transmitted through a clutch cable or the like to a release bearing (not shown), and the release bearing moves inward in the axial direction. This movement of the release bearing is transmitted through the support plate 6 to the pressure plate 4, and the pressure plate 4 moves inward in the axial direction. As a result, the pressing force of the pressure plate 4 is released, which makes it possible for the first clutch plates 31 and the second clutch plate 32 to rotate relatively between the output-side rotating body 2 and the pressure plate 4. This interrupts<br><br>
the transmission of power from the clutch housing 1 to the output-side rotating body 2 (clutch disengaged state), [0043]   Air Flow<br>
With this clutch device 100, air on the outside of the diaphragm spring 5 in the axial direction is guided to the inside in the axial direction by the levers 52 and fins 53 of the diaphragm spring 5. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 4, when the diaphragm spring 5 rotates to the R1 side, air around the outside in the axial direction of the diaphragm spring 5 (the space S A) and the diaphragm spring 5 rotate relative to one another. At this point the surrounding air is pulled inward in the axial direction by the fins 53 that are tilted inward in the axial direction. Therefore, the surrounding air is brought through the openings SI in the diaphragm spring 5 into the space formed between the diaphragm spring 5 and the output-side rotating body 2.<br>
[0044]   This action of bringing in air is continued as long as the clutch device 100 is rotating. Therefore, the air that is brought in goes through the holes 27 in the output-side rotating body 2, is guided to the space formed in the axial direction between the output-side rotating body 2 and the pressure plate 4, and flows into the clutch 3.<br>
[0045]    At the clutch 3, the first clutch plates 31 and the second clutch plate 32 do not slide against each other, and a gap is formed in the axial direction between the plates 31 and 32. Therefore, air that flows into the clutch 3 flows outward in the radial direction through the gaps between the first clutch plates 31 and the second clutch plate 32, goes through the notches 15, and is discharged to the space SB on the outer peripheral side. [0046]   Since misted lubricating oil is contained in the air circulating around the clutch<br><br>
device 100, this misted lubricating oil is supplied along with the air through the channel P to the friction faces of the first and second clutch plates 31 and 32. [0047]   Features<br>
As discussed above, with this clutch device 100, since the diaphragm spring 5 has the fins 53, a flow in the axial direction can be generated in the surrounding air, and the surrounding air can be guided into the clutch housing 1 through the channel P. This allows the misted lubricating oil that circulates around the clutch device 100 to be guided to the clutch 3, so the lubricating performance of the clutch device 100 can be enhanced with a simple structure. [0048]    Other Embodiments<br>
The specific constitution of the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications and improvements are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. [0049]   (1)<br>
The shape and layout of the fins 53 of the diaphragm spring 5 are not limited to those in the above embodiment. For example, fins 153 may be provided to the R1 side of levers 152 as with the diaphragm spring 105 shown in Fig. 5. These fins 153 are tilted inward in the axial direction with respect to the levers 152, and extend inward in the axial direction from the levers 152.<br>
[0050]   In this case, as opposed to the above embodiment, air on the inside in the axial direction of the diaphragm spring 105 is discharged to the outside in the axial direction by the action of the fins 153. As a result, an air flow is produced in the opposite direction from that<br><br>
in the above embodiment when the clutch is disengaged. More specifically, air in the space SB is brought in through the notches 15, and is discharged through the channel P into the space SA. Here again, the misted lubricating oil is guided through the notches 15 to the clutch 3. Therefore, the same effect as in the above embodiment is obtained. [0051]    (2)<br>
A diaphragm spring^205 such as that shown in Fig. 6 is also possible. In this case, fins 253 are provided on the R1 side of levers 252, and the fins 253 extend outward in the axial direction from the levers 252. The fins 253 are tilted with respect to the levers 252. [00521   I" this case, just as in the embodiment above, air in the space SA is brought in by the fins 253 to the inside in the axial direction of the diaphragm spring 205, and the misted lubricating oil is guided through the channel P to the clutch 3. [0053]    (3)<br>
A diaphragm spring 305 such as that shown in Fig. 7 is also possible. In this case, fms 353 are provided on the R2 side of levers 352, and the fins 353 extend outward in the axial direction from the levers 352. The fins 353 are tilted with respect to the levers 352. [0054]   In this case, just as in the embodiment above, air on the inside in the axial direction of the diaphragm spring 305 is discharged by the fins 353 into the space SA, so the air in the space SB is guided through the notches 15 to the clutch 3. [0055]    (4)<br>
In the above embodiment, a case was described in which rotation was inputted fi-om an input gear and outputted to the output-side rotating body 2, but the present invention can also be applied to a case in which the transmission path of rotation is reversed.<br><br>
[0056]   Also, as long as there is a space corresponding to the channel P on the inside, the constitution of the clutch device 100 is not limited to that in the above embodiment. [0057]    (5)<br>
The number and shape of the fins 53 are not limited to those in the above embodiment. For example, the fins 53 may be provided only to some of the levers 52, or the fms 53 may be curved plate-shaped members. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
