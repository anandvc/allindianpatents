				<td>NANOTUBE ASSEMBLY, BIPOLAR PLATE AND PROCESS OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The field  to  which  the  disclosure  generally  relates  includes  metal  oxide<br>
nanotubes, bipolar plates, and fuel cells.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	Nano-materials have been explored extensively as fundamental building blocks<br>
for advanced functional materials. Nanotubes, with large surface area and high aspect<br>
ratio, hold the most promise to provide unique and improved properties to new<br>
materials. Although there are many different processes of producing nanotubes,<br>
organizing and manipulating nanotubes into a particular assembly to create a real world<br>
structure at a product scale has been challenging.<br>
[0003]	A fuel cell has been recognized as one of most promising energy device due to<br>
its high energy efficiency and low emission. There are, however, many technical and<br>
economical challenges for commercial design and production of fuel cells.<br>
Nanomaterials, such as nanotubes, can potentially help overcome some of the<br>
challenges. Improvement of fuel cell bipolar plate, for example, is needed in the areas<br>
of corrosion resistance, water management capability and durability.<br>
[0004]	A fuel cell usually consists of a series of membrane electrode assemblies and<br>
bipolar plates stacked together in an alternating manner. The membrane electrode<br>
assembly is typically made of an ion conductive membrane sandwiched between an<br>
anode and a cathode sections each on the opposite side of the membrane. Bipolar plate<br>
is a plate like electric conductor having plurality of channels for fluid passage. The<br>
reactive gases flow through those channels to reach the anode and cathode sections<br><br>
where electrochemical reactions of the gases take place to generate electricity. The<br>
electricity generated from the electrochemical reactions is collected and conducted<br>
through the bipolar plate to an external circuit. The bipolar plate, therefore, needs to<br>
have high electric conductivity or low contact resistance to avoid energy loss. The<br>
bipolar plate also needs to meet very stringent corrosion resistance requirement due to<br>
the harsh environment created by the reactive gases, electrochemical reactions and<br>
contaminants generated from the membrane electrolyte in the process. In the case of a<br>
hydrogen fuel cell, water management is another key challenge. Water is continuously<br>
generated in a hydrogen fuel cell and the ion conductive membrane needs to maintain a<br>
certain hydration level. When a hydrogen fuel cell is operated at a low current density,<br>
for example, at 0.2 A /cm2, there would not be enough gas flow to remove the water<br>
generated at the cathode section. Water drops can form in the fluid passages and block<br>
the flow of reactive gas. Without the supply of reactant gas, the blocked section of the<br>
fuel cell will not produce electricity. Performance of the fuel cell will deteriorate due to<br>
non-homogeneous current distribution. Such phenomenon is known as low power<br>
stability (LPS). Although there are several recent approaches to improve LPS by making<br>
the plate channel surface hydrophilic to spread out condensed water, further<br>
improvement in water management is desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	In one embodiment, an assembly comprises a plurality of valve metal oxide<br>
nanotubes. Valve metal may comprise at least one of titanium, zirconium, niobium,<br>
tantalum, hafnium or mixtures or alloys thereof. The valve metal oxide nanotube may<br>
be produced to provide photocatalytic activity.<br><br>
[0006]	In another embodiment, a bipolar plate having plurality of channels configured for<br>
fluid passages is provided. The bipolar plate comprises a valve metal plate having a<br>
metal oxide nanotube assembly disposed on at least part of its surface. The metal<br>
oxide nanotube assembly provides improved water management in addition to corrosion<br>
resistance and electric conductivity.<br>
[0007]	Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of making a metal oxide<br>
nanotube assembly comprising: providing a valve metal selected from the group<br>
consisting titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, hafnium or any mixtures thereof;<br>
anodizing said valve metal in an electrolyte solution to cause the formation of a<br>
nanotube assembly on the valve metal surface; and passivating said valve metal in an<br>
electrolyte solution at a anodizing potential or voltage such that the electric current<br>
flowing through the valve metal reaches a minimum level.<br>

0009]	Unless explicitly stated, the method embodiments described herein are not<br>
constrained to a particular order or sequence.  Some of the described embodiments or<br>
elements thereof can occur or be performed at the same point in time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015]	The following description of the embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.<br>
[0016]	Valve metals are metal materials that exhibit the property of forming an innate<br>
protective oxide layer on the metal surface, effectively protecting the metal from<br>
corrosion.   Examples of valve metals include titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum,<br>
hafnium, or any mixtures or alloys thereof. The innate protective valve metal oxide films<br>
are typically thin and compact in structure. The innate oxide film thus has small surface<br>
area.<br>
[0017]	Nanotube is referred to herein as a tube like structure where the diameter of the<br>
tube ranges from 1 nanometer to 300 nanometers.   The tube is general elongated.<br>
Nanotubes typically provide large surface area due to its hollow structure and small<br>
dimensions.<br>
[0018]	In one embodiment of this invention, a valve metal is anodized in an electrolyte<br>
solution at a sufficient electrochemical potential or a voltage.   This may cause the<br><br>
roughening surface to occur, initially creating a porous surface. Either a two electrodes<br>
cell or a three electrodes cell may be used in the anodizing process. In a two<br>
electrodes cell, an anode and a cathode are immersed in an electrolyte solution and a<br>
controlled voltage is applied cross the two electrodes. A valve metal material is used as<br>
the anode. In a three electrodes cell, a reference electrode (such as silver/silver<br>
chloride reference electrode), a working electrode and a counter electrode are<br>
immersed in an electrolyte solution. The working electrode is a valve metal in the shape<br>
of a plate or other configurations. The counter electrode is typically an inert conductive<br>
material such as platinum or graphite. The electrochemical potential is applied to the<br>
working electrode by controlling the voltage between the reference electrode and the<br>
working electrode. There is minimal, if any, current flowing through the reference<br>
electrode. The current generated from the anodizing process flows only between the<br>
working electrode and the counter electrode. The potential of the working electrode is<br>
thus set at the oxidation potential of the valve metal or beyond to cause anodization of<br>
the valve metal surface. Relative large current flow may be created in the initial stage to<br>
initiate the surface roughening. Further anodization induces the formation of an ordered<br>
assembly of metal oxide nanotubes and the passivation of the valve metal surface.<br>
Electric current typically drops when an assembly of nanotubes is formed. The current<br>
drops to a minimal level as the valve metal surface is passivated. The valve metal<br>
surface may be substantially covered with such a corrosion resistant metal oxide<br>
nanotube assembly. The nanotubes in the assembly may be substantially parallel to<br>
each other and interconnected in a side-by-side manner. Not only an assembly of<br>
relative uniform metal oxide nanotubes is prepared, but also a valve metal material<br>
passivated with excellent corrosion resistant protective layer is obtained.<br><br>
[0019]	The electrolyte used in the anodizing process may include any materials that can<br>
provide ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability at the anodizing conditions. The<br>
electrolyte typically comprises an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid or<br>
salt. A mixture of different salts and acids may also be used. In one embodiment, an<br>
electrolyte solution containing an ion that is capable of at least partially penetrating the<br>
innate valve metal oxide film and/or forming a complex with the valve metal may be<br>
used to induce the initial surface roughening in the anodizing process to facilitate the<br>
formation of nanotubes. The electrolyte solution may comprise chloride, fluoride, or<br>
oxalate ions.<br>
[0020]	Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of an anodizing process using a two<br>
electrodes cell where a valve metal anode 10 and a cathode 30 are immersed in an<br>
electrolyte solution 20. A controlled voltage 40 is applied cross the two electrodes such<br>
that the valve metal is oxided electrochemically. In one embodiment, a titanium coupon<br>
is used as the anode and a stainless steel plate is used as the cathode. The two<br>
electrodes were immersed in a 0.2 M hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution. A 20 volts<br>
voltage was applied between the anode and the cathode for 15 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The current spikes rapidly when the voltage was first applied. The current<br>
decreases subsequently and reached a minimal level when the coupon surface is<br>
passivated with an assembly of titanium oxide nanotubes.<br>
[0021]	Figure 2 shows the field emission scanning electron micrographs of the titanium<br>
coupon surface after the anodizing process. Micrograph A shows a top view of the<br>
assembly of titanium oxide nanotubes formed from the anodizing process. Micrograph<br>
B is a cross-sectional view of the same nanotube assembly. The average diameter of<br>
the titanium oxide nanotube is about 60-75 nanometers (nm), and the length of the<br>
nanotube ranges from about 15 nm to about 300 nm.    In a similar but separate<br><br>
experiment, a titanium coupon anode and a stainless steel cathode were immersed in a<br>
0.2 M hydrogen fluoride solution at room temperature. 20 V was applied cross the<br>
anode and the cathode, and the titanium anode surface was examined using field<br>
emission scanning electron microscope at different point of time after the application of<br>
the voltage. Figure 3 shows the field emission electron micrographs of the titanium<br>
electrode surface at different time points. As shown in the Figure 3, at 2 minutes and<br>
within the initial stage, surface roughening is clearly visible. At 5 minutes, some<br>
titanium oxide nanotubes are formed sporadically cross the surface. At 10 minutes, an<br>
assembly of nanotubes covers virtually the entire surface. At 15 and 210 minutes, the<br>
nanotubes stabilized with only slight increase in nanotube diameter, indicating<br>
substantial passivation of the metal surface. An assembly of parallel and<br>
interconnected titanium oxide nanotubes is thus produced. A titanium metal passivated<br>
with an assembly of titanium dioxide nanotubes is also obtained.<br>
[0022]	The assembly of valve metal oxide nanotubes has very large surface area<br>
compared to an innate compact oxide film. The assembly thus exhibit excellent<br>
properties of a catalyst or a carrier for a catalyst. In one embodiment, an assembly of<br>
titanium oxide nanotubes is produced as described above. The assembly of titanium<br>
oxide nanotubes exhibits photocatalytic activity. Additionally, an assembly of anatase<br>
rich crystalline (from 50% to about 99%) form of titanium dioxide nanotubes may be<br>
produced for high photocatalytic activity. Anatase is one of the 3 crystal forms of<br>
titanium dioxide (rutile, anatase and brookite). An assembly of anatase rich form of the<br>
titanium dioxide nanotubes may be obtained by calcination of the assembly described<br>
above to a temperature between 300°C and about 700°C. As a photocatalyst, titanium<br>
dioxide can carry out hydrolysis, i.e., break water into hydrogen and oxygen when<br>
exposed to UV light. The hydrogen collected from the process can be used as a fuel.<br><br>
The efficiency of this process can be greatly improved by doping the oxide with carbon,<br>
nitrogen, or other elements. The assembly of photocatalytic nanotubes can also be<br>
used as self-cleaning surfaces such as automobile windshield surfaces.<br>
[0023]	The assembly of valve metal oxide nanotubes prepared from anodization<br>
increases the corrosion resistance and wear resistance of a valve metal, and provides<br>
better adhesion for paint primers and glues than bare metal. The assembly of<br>
nanotubes described above is generally much stronger and more adherent than most<br>
paints and platings, making them less likely to crack and peel.<br>
[0024]	In yet another embodiment, a bipolar plate for fuel cells is prepared by forming on<br>
the surface of the plate an assembly of valve metal oxide nanotubes. A thin valve metal<br>
plate, such as a titanium metal plate, is first stamped to form a plurality of channels as<br>
passage for fluids such as reactive gases. The valve metal is then anodized in an<br>
electrolyte solution as described above to form an assembly of valve metal oxide<br>
nanotubes on its surface. A bipolar plate produced in this manner exhibits not only<br>
excellent corrosion resistance, but improved water management property. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, a thin titanium metal sheet is stamped with a pattern of gas<br>
flow channels. The stamped titanium plate as an anode is then immersed in a 0.2 M<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution along with a stainless steel cathode. A 20 V may be<br>
then applied cross the two electrodes for about 15 minutes to form an assembly of<br>
titanium oxide nanotubes on the bipolar plate surface. The bipolar plate exhibits a water<br>
contact angle of less than 15 degree immediately after the formation of the nanotube<br>
assembly. The bipolar plate is left in open air in a laboratory environment for about one<br>
week to test the robustness of the surface against air contaminants which typically<br>
would increase the water contact angle substantially. The contact angle after one week<br>
exposure to laboratory air only increases slightly to about 22 degree. Such a low water<br><br>
contact angle indicates the robustness of the assembly to provide water management<br>
property to a bipolar plate and a significant improvement in LPS (low power stability) to<br>
a fuel cell. Although the Applicants do not wish to be bound by or to a particular theory,<br>
it is believed that the large surface area and the nano-porous structure of the assembly<br>
which is augmented by the oxide chemistry which tends to retain water, afford such<br>
improved water management performance. The assembly not only efficiently spreads<br>
out water drops to prevent clogging of gas flow channels, but also absorbs a thin layer<br>
of water within its porous structure.<br>
[0025]	The electric contact resistance of the bipolar plate described above can be<br>
improved by coating a thin layer of noble metal, carbon, metal carbide, metal nitride or a<br>
conductive oxide. The conductive coating is applied to provide a surface contact<br>
resistance of less than about 50 milli-ohms centimeter square(mohm cm2), or preferably<br>
less than 10 mohm/cm2. Noble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion or<br>
oxidation, unlike most base metals. Examples of noble metal include gold, silver,<br>
tantalum, platinum, palladium and rhodium. Any oxides that exhibit high electric<br>
conductivity and corrosion resistance may also be used to improve the contact<br>
resistance of the bipolar plate. Mixed metal oxides, single metal oxides, and doped<br>
metal oxides may be deposited on the bipolar plate by chemical vapor deposition,<br>
vacuum deposition, spattering, ion plating, spray, dip-coating, atomic layer deposition<br>
and the like. Non-limiting examples of conductive metal coating include fluorine doped<br>
tin oxide, tantalum doped titanium dioxide, niobium doped titanium dioxide, iridium<br>
oxide, ruthenium oxide, mixed oxide of titanium and ruthenium, and titanium oxide with<br>
oxygen vacancies. In one particular embodiment, a titanium bipolar plate having a<br>
titanium oxide nanotube assembly is prepared as described above. The contact<br>
resistance of the bipolar plate  is about 380  mohm/cm2 on a sample to paper<br><br>
measurement. The bipolar plate is then dip coated using a 3wt% ruthenium chloride in<br>
ethanol solution, followed by drying and calcination at 450°C for 15 minutes to convert<br>
ruthenium chloride into ruthenium oxide.. The resulting bipolar plate has a contact<br>
resistance ranged from about 6 to 8 mohm cm2.<br>
[0026]	The assembly of nanotubes may comprise mixture of at least two different metal<br>
oxides. For example, a metal alloy may be anodized in the method described above.<br>
The metal oxide nanotubes formed from the alloy thus comprise a mixture of metal<br>
oxides with composition similar to the innate oxide layer of the alloy. The composition<br>
of the assembly of nanotubes can be varied by using different metal alloys as the anode<br>
material. By varying the composition, a mixed oxide with excellent corrosion resistance<br>
and electric conductivity can be prepared. Examples of electric conductive mixed<br>
oxides may include any mixtures of titanium oxide, ruthenium oxide, tantalum oxide, and<br>
niobium oxide.<br>
[0027]	The conductive coating and/or the assembly of metal oxide nanotubes may be<br>
formed on the entire surface of a bipolar plate or selectively on the surface of gas flow<br>
channels or surface contact areas. To form a conductive coating or assembly on<br>
selected areas of the bipolar plate, the areas that are not to be treated can be masked<br>
first with a mask template or a removable protective layer. An example of selective<br>
deposition process for preparing a bipolar plate is described in a US Patent Application<br>
Publication Number 20060105222.<br>
[0028]	Referring now to FIG. 4, one embodiment of the invention includes a product<br>
10 comprising a fuel cell 12. The fuel cell 12 may include a first fuel cell bipolar plate<br>
14 including a first face 16 having a reactant gas flow field defined therein by a<br>
plurality of lands 18 and channels 20. The reactant gas flow field may deliver a fuel<br>
on one side of the bipolar plate and an oxidant on the other side of the bipolar plate.<br><br>
The surface of the lands 18 may include a conductive coating or bare metal surface.<br>
The conductive coating may be a thin layer of noble metal, carbon, metal carbide,<br>
metal nitride or a conductive oxide as described above. The bipolar plate may be<br>
prepared by stamping a thin sheet of valve metal such as titanium sheet to form a<br>
designed pattern of channels 20 for fluid passages.<br>
[0029]	According to one embodiment of the invention, the entire surface including the<br>
lands 18 and the channels 20 may be coated with a coating 11 including an assembly of<br>
valve metal oxide nanotubes and optionally a conductive coating. The fuel cell 12 may<br>
also include a second fuel cell bipolar plate 22 including a first face 24 having a reactant<br>
gas flow field defined therein by a plurality of lands 26 and channels 28. The lands 18<br>
or 16 and the channels 20 or 28 may be formed in the bipolar plate 14 or 22 by<br>
machining, etching, stamping, molding or the like. According to another embodiment, a<br>
coating 11 including an assembly of valve metal oxide nanotubes is selectively<br>
deposited on portions of the bipolar plate 22, for example only on the surface defining<br>
the channel 28 formed in the bipolar plate 22. A ruthenium oxide, gold or carbon<br>
conductive coating layer may be deposited on the lands 18, by chemical coating,<br>
calcinations, vacuum deposition, spattering, or other deposition methods know to an<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0030]	A soft goods portion 30 may be provided between the first fuel cell bipolar<br>
plate 14 and the second fuel cell bipolar plate 22. The first fuel cell bipolar plate 14<br>
and the second fuel cell bipolar plate 22 may include a variety of materials including,<br>
but not limited to, a metal, metal alloy, and/or electrically conductive composite. In<br>
one embodiment of the invention, the first fuel cell bipolar plate 14 and the second<br>
fuel cell bipolar plate 22 may be stainless steel.<br><br>
[0031]	The soft goods portion 30 may include a polymer electrolyte membrane 32<br>
comprising a first face 34 and a second face 36. A cathode electrode may overlie<br>
the first face 34 of the polymer electrolyte membrane 32. A first gas diffusion media<br>
layer 40 may overlie the cathode electrode 38, and optionally a first microporous<br>
layer 42 may be interposed between the first gas diffusion media layer 40 and the<br>
cathode electrode 38. The first gas diffusion media layer 40 may be hydrophobia<br>
The first bipolar plate 14 may overlie the first gas diffusion media layer 40. If<br>
desired, a hydrophilic layer (not shown) may be interposed between the first fuel cell<br>
bipolar plate 14 and the first gas diffusion media layer 40.<br>
[0032]	An anode electrode 46 may underlie the second face 36 of the polymer<br>
electrolyte membrane 32. A second gas diffusion media layer 48 may underlie the<br>
anode layer 46, and optionally a second microporous layer 50 may be interposed<br>
between the second gas diffusion media layer 48 and the anode electrode 46. The<br>
second gas diffusion media layer 48 may be hydrophobic. The second fuel cell<br>
bipolar plate 22 may overlie the second gas diffusion media layer 48. If desired, a<br>
second hydrophilic layer (not shown) may be interposed between the second fuel<br>
cell bipolar plate 22 and the second gas diffusion media layer 48.<br>
[0033]	In various embodiments, the polymer electrolyte membrane 32 may comprise<br>
a variety of different types of membranes. The polymer electrolyte membrane 32<br>
useful in various embodiments of the invention may be an ion-conductive material.<br>
Examples of suitable membranes are disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,272,353 and<br>
3,134,689, and in the Journal of Power Sources, Volume 28 (1990), pages 367-387.<br>
Such membranes are also known as ion exchange resin membranes. The resins<br>
include ionic groups in their polymeric structure; one ionic component for which is<br>
fixed or retained by the polymeric matrix and at least one other ionic component<br><br>
being a mobile replaceable ion electrostatically associated with the fixed component.<br>
The ability of the mobile ion to be replaced under appropriate conditions with other<br>
ions imparts ion exchange characteristics to these materials.<br>
[0034]	The ion exchange resins can be prepared by polymerizing a mixture of<br>
ingredients, one of which contains an ionic constituent. One broad class of cationic<br>
exchange, proton conductive resins is the so-called sulfonic acid cationic exchange<br>
resin. In the sulfonic acid membranes, the cationic exchange groups are sulfonic<br>
acid groups which are attached to the polymer backbone.<br>
[0035]	The formation of these ion exchange resins into membranes or chutes<br>
is well-known to those skilled in the art. The preferred type is perfluorinated sulfonic<br>
acid polymer electrolyte in which the entire membrane structure has ionic exchange<br>
characteristics. These membranes are commercially available, and a typical<br>
example of a commercial sulfonic perfluorocarbon proton conductive membrane is<br>
sold by E. I. DuPont D Nemours &amp; Company under the trade designation NAFION.<br>
