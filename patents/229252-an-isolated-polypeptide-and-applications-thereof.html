FORM 3 A  THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 ComMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SEE SECTION - 10)<br>
OVEL PROCESS FOR PRODUCING NOVEL   BACTERIAL ENZYME SUBUNITS'<br>
ME, M/S. ASTRA RESEARCH CENTRE INDIA, A REGISTERED INDIAN SOCIETY, OF 18TH CROSS, MALLESWARAM, BANGALORE - 560 003, KARNATAKA  STATE, INDIA.<br>
THE INVENTORS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION ARE DR. MEENAKSHI BAL6ANESH AND MR. UMENDAR K. SHARMA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
BACKBROUND *<br>
Th« primary event involved in gene expreasion is the transcription of the specific DNA to a RNA Molecule. This transcription is achieved by a DNA dependent RNA polymerase or RNA polyaerase for brevity. The catalytically active RNA polyeerase holoenzyee is structurally coeplex and is coeprised of 0^2^ P , p and the subunits. RNA synthesis froe specific proMoters is catalysed by the enzyee in the presence of the sigaa Bubunit. The sigea subunit has been assigned the indirect role of conferring on the core enzyee the ability to select a start site and initiate RNA synthesis. Physical eeasureeents have shotm that the sigea subunit induces conforeational transition upon binding to core enzyee. Binding constants of IMA core enzyee Mith sigea shoM a difference of lO — iO orders of eagnitude.<br>
The functional characterisation of the different subunits of the RNA polyeerase indicate the B subunit to be involved in the catalysis, the B subunit in the DNA binding Mhile the a subunits function has yet to be delineated. Mutations in the sigea subimit effecting its association and ability to confer DNA sequence specificity to the enzyee are known to be lethal to the cell.<br><br>
AnothoNT interesting characteristic of the sigma subunits identified and sequenced froe different organisnis allows then to be classified into tMo broad categariesi<br>
The Broup Z sigea have also been referred to the sig«a-70 class or the house keeping sigea group. The sigea subunits belonging to this group recognise sieilar DMA sequences for proaoter activity Mhich is reflected in certain regions of the protein being highly conserved. The Broup II sigea differ in their sequences and even though shoM certain hoeologous sequences based on sieilarity of function, they aro involved in conferring cm the core RNA polyeerase the ability to recognise a variety of sequences (specific for the sigea) Mhich results in the regulation of the expression of the gene as a factor dependent on the availability of the specific sigea protein.<br>
The essential requiresent of the association of the sigea subunit to confer specificity to the core RNA polyeerase enzyme eakes the process of association a suitable target for drug design. Obviously the inhibition of the association prcwcess would require the identification of the prieary structures of the sigea Buribunits involved in trwriscription. The availability of the sequences and structure itould then enable the screening, identification or designing of molecules coepeting with the sigea subunit for binding to the core enzyme. These molecules/compound which prevent sigma binding to the core enzyme could then be developed into effective thereupetic agents.  The sigma  subunits<br><br>
identified the -far have very limited hcmology to eukaryotic transcription factors thus making the sigma's highly specific drug targets.<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major pulmonary pathogen which is characterised by its very show growth rate. As a pathogen it gains access to the alveolar macrophages where it multiplies within the phagosome, finally lysing the cells and being disseminated through the blood stream not only to other areas of the lung but also to extrapulmonary tissues. Thus the pathogen multiplies in atleast two entirely different enviornments which would involve the utilisation of different nutrients and a variety of passible hostile factors | a successful invasion would thus involve the co-ordinated expression of new sets of genes. This regulation would resemble different physiological stages as best exemplified by Bacillus in which the expression of genes specific for different stages are transcribed by RNA polymerases associating with different sigma factors. This again the possibility of targetting not only the house keeping sigma of n.tuberculosis but also sigma subunits specific for the different stages of multiplication.<br>
1)  IDENTIFICATION OF DNA SEQUENCES IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS<br>
HonoLoeous TO THE SIGMA 70 OENE «<br>
chromosomal DNA from M.tuberculosis H37Rv, H37Ra and M.smegmatis were made following standaurd protocols, restricted with different restriction  enzymes  and  the DNA fragments  resolved  on  a  1%<br><br>
agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.la of the draMings acconpanying the provisional specification). The resolved DNA was then transferred onto nylon aeebranes following standard procedures and the eeebranes subjectcwl to Southern analysis. To detect honologouB frageents the eeebranes were probed with a radioactively labelled DNA frageent generated by PC^. The PCR gencN^ated probe was a SOO bp DNA fragaent aaplified from the chroMosoee of H.tuberculosis using degenerate forward and reverse prieers designed based C3n the highly conserved amino acid sequence motiffs of E.coli and B.subtilis sigma 70 proteins. The amino acid sequence used to design primers is highlighted in Fig.2 of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification.<br>
Analysis of the Southern hybridisation experiment revealed the presence of atleast three hybridising fragments of approximately 4.2, 2.4 and 0.9 kb in the Sal 1 digested DNA (fig lb of the drawings accompany!ng the provisional specification). The pattern of hybridisation was identical in both the strains H.tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv. In the case of the Sal 1 digested/hybridised DNA of H.smegmatis only two hybridising fragments of 4.2 and 2.4 were detected. The hybridisation pattern with the EcoRl and Pvu 11 restricted/hybridised DNA was not clear probably due to the size of fragments generated. However based on the patterns obtained with the Sal 1 restricted DNA it could be concluded that there were multiple DNA fragments with homology to the known sigma 70 genes.<br><br>
Siailar  Southern  hybridisation  experiment to  identify	the<br>
pattern  of  hoMologous genes  in  a 4 clinical  isolates	of<br>
H.tt^erculosis revealed  an  identical  pattern  indicating	the<br>
presence of sieilar gene in other virulent isolates	of<br>
M.tuberculosi s.<br>
2&gt; CLONINB OF THE HYBRIDISING DMA FRABHENTS REPRESENTINB PUTATIVE SISHA 70 HOnDLOQQUS s<br>
CLONING OF THE 4.2 Kb SAL 1 HYBRIDISING FRAGMENT f<br>
n.tuberculosis H37Rv DNA Mns restricted Mith Sal 1 and fragments ramolved by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The agarose gel corresponding to 4.0 to 5.0 kb size region Mas cut and the DNA extracted fro« the gel following standard protocols. This size fractionated DNA Mas then ligated to the cloning vector pBR 329 at its Sal 1 site. The ligated DNA Mas then transforeed into E.coli DH5a and the transformants of the sub—library screened by colony blotting using the PCR derived (described under identifications) probe following described protocols. Several hybridising colonies Mere identified and the analysis of the plasaid profile of these clones revealed thee to harbour a Sal 1 insert of 4.2 kb Mhich hybridised in southern blotting experiaents Mith the PCR probe confiraing the cloning of the honologous 4.2 kb frageent.<br><br>
CLONINB OF THE 2.2 Kb 8AL1 HYBRIDISINB FRA6MENT s<br>
A lauabda gtli library (obtained fro* WHO) of the chromosoMal DNA of n.tuberculosis Erdean strain Mas screened using the saee probe as described above folloMing standard procedures. One lambda gtll phage with a 4.2 kb EccAl insert was identified and confireed to hybridise utith the PCR probe. Restriction analysis of the EcoRl insert revealed it to have an internal 2.2 Kb Sal 1 frageent which hybridised with the saee probe confirming this clone to harbour the 2.2 Kb Sal 1 frageent identified earlier by Southern hybridisation.<br>
This 4.2 kb EcoRl frageent was excised as an EcoRl fragment from the lambda gt 11 DIM and subcloned into the cloning vector pBR 329 to obtain the recombinant plasmid pARC SigA.<br>
The restriction pattern of the two hybridising fragments being different the putative sigma 70 homologue on the 2.2 kb Sal 1 fragment (included within the 4.2 kb EcoR 1 insert of the lambda gt 11 phage) was designated M.tb Sigma A while the homologue on the 4.2 kb Sal 1 fragment was designated M.tb Sigma B. A schematic representation of the recoaribinant plasmids harbouring the Sig A gene is shown in fig 3 of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification and the Sig B gene is shown in Fig 4 of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification.<br><br>
In the accoapanying drawings i<br>
Fig 1 ropresents the DMA sequence of Sigea A and the saMe is referred to as Seq. ID No. 1 hereinafter.<br>
Fig 2 represents the protein sequence of Sigea A and the saee is identified as Seq. ID i4o. 2.<br>
Fig 3 represents the DNA sequence of Sigea B and the sa«e is refer-red to as Seq. ID No. 3 hereinafter.<br>
Fig 4 represents the protein sequence of Sigea B and the saae is identified as Seq. ID No. 4.<br>
The coding sequence of the Sig A gene Mas found to have an internal Sal 1 site Mhich could explain the hybridisation of the 0.9 kb frageents in the southern experiaents.<br>
NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE OF THE M.tb.Sig A AND Sig B 6ENES s<br>
Sig A I<br>
The DNA sequence of EcoRV — EcoRi fragtaent encompassing the entire SigA gene utas stubcloned into appropriate iil3 vectors and both strands of the gene sequenced by the dideoxy ecrthcxJ. The sequence obtained is shoitn in Fig.5 of the drawings accoepanying the provisional specification. An ORF of 1578 nucleotides coding for a protein of S26 aaiino acids was predicted from the DNA sequence.   The derived amino acid sequence of the Sig  A showed<br><br>
60X identity with the E.coli Sigea 70 and 70X identity with the HrdB sequence of Streptoeyces coelicolar. The overall antoey of the Sig A sequence is compatible with that seen with the alignecnt aanng Sigma 70 proteins of different organisms. This consists of a highly conserved C-terminal half while the N-terminal half generally shows lesser hcMKilogy. The two regions are linked by a stretch of amino acids which vary in length and are found to be generally unigque for the protein. The Sig A sequence also has a similar structure where the unconserved central stretch correspond to amino acids in length. There is limited homology within the N-terminal half as compared to the Sigma 70 of E.coli but shows greater resemblance to that of the Sigma 70 homologue HrdB of S.coelicolor. The highly conserved motiffs of Region 3.1, 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2 proposed to be involved in DMA binding are were found to be near identical in the M.tb Sig A sequence also. The N—terminal start of the protein has been tentatively assigned based on homologous motiffs of the S.coelicolor HrdB sequence. The sequence similarity abled assignment of the Sig A to the Broup 1 sigma but definitely shows distinct differences especially a unique and lengthty N—terminal stretch of amino acids which may be essential for the transcription of promoter sequences of H.tuberculosis.<br>
Sig B I<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the Sig B (Fig 6 of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification) gene identific»s the gene  to be nucleotides encoding a protein  of  amino acids.<br><br>
Alignnent of the aaiino acid sequence of the Sig B gene Mith other sigflia 70 proteinm places the Sig B gene into the Qroup 1 family of sigea 70 proteins. The overall structure of the protein folloMS the mamm pattern as described for Sig A. HoMever the Sig B sequence has only 60X hoMology Hith the Sig A sequence as there are considerable differences not only Mithin the unconserved regions of the protein but also Mithin the putative DMA binding regions of the Sig B protein. These characteristics suggest that the Sig B protein eay play a distinct function in the physiology of the organism. The N-ter«inal start of the protein has bemn tentatively identified based on the presence of the first Methionine of the ORF.<br><br><br>
