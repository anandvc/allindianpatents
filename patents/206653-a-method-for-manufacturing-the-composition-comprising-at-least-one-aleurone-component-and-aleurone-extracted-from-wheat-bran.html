THE PATENTS ACT, 197 0 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE COMPOSITION COMPRESENG               AT LEAST ONE ALEURAME COMPONENT AND ALEURONE                     EXTRACTED FROM WHEATBRAN<br>
BUHLER AG of CH-9240 UZWIL, SWITZERLAND, SWISS Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -                             Granted<br>
                                         24-5-2005<br>
Original<br><br>
The invention relates to means of supplying the body system with aleurone.<br>
From nutritional/physiological aspects, aleurone is an extremely valuable component of grain, and to a particular extent of wheat, and is located in the wheat in a single-cell layer (aleurone layer) between the flour body (endosperm) and the shell (pericarp and testa) of the wheat. The average weight proportion of aleurone in the wheat is 8,3%.<br>
Aleurone is isolated from bran by means of physical or, in particular, mechanical/abrasive and biological/enzymatic processes, and subjected to further treatment. Reference is made at this stage to international patent application PCT/CH 01/00506 in the name of the same Applicant.<br>
In the aleurone cells of the wheat, all nutritionally/physiologically significant substances of wheat are contained in concentrated form, for example, vitamins, mineral substances, essential fatty acids, food fibres, high-quality protein (albumin), and special protective substances (bioactive substances, such as phenoles, lignan, phytin etc). Moreover, wheat has been used for several thousand years as a tried-and-tested food for both animals and human beings.<br>
The high content of vitamins and mineral substances contribute to a healthy state in general and to mental and physical productivity.<br>
The food fibres of the aleurone help to improve digestive activities. In particular, they slow down resorption, and thus promote a lasting feeling of repletion.<br>
Aleurone is easily digestible. A specific point is that it contains no sticky proteins (gliadin, glutenin), and is thus also suitable for those suffering from wheat allergy or coeliac disease.<br>
Bioactive substances of aleurone, such as polyphenols, flavanoids, lignan, beta-glucan etc, have protective effects against a number of illnesses caused by civilisation, such as the hardening of the arteries and cancer.<br><br><br>
The task of the invention is to enable a use of aleurone and its components in human and animal nutrition.<br>
The task is solved by a means of supplying aleurone components and/or aleurone, extracted from bran, in particular wheat bran, when the effective substances contained in the aleurone and thus their favourable physiological properties are supplied to the human or animal organism in an easily accessible form. As a result, the nutritional/physiological components of the aleurone can be better absorbed by the organism than upon the consumption of whole grain.<br>
In the form concerned, the various aleurone components are preferably contained in relative proportions which correspond to their natural relative proportions in bran, particularly wheat bran. In view of the fact that, despite a severe re-construction of our environment and way of life, the genetic make-up of a human being and numerous animals and livestock has changed to only a slight extent, it can be assumed that this "natural mix relationship" is for the organism and its physiological reactions still fairly well "geared to needs".<br>
The various aleurone components can, as required, be contained in relative proportions which deviate from their natural relative proportions in bran, in particular wheat bran.<br>
Moreover, the aleurone components can be in the form of aleurone cell groups, which comprise up to 100 aleurone cells, in particular around 5 to 50 aleurone cells on average, and preferably around 10 to 20 aleurone cells. This form of aleurone can, on the one hand, be extracted economically from the bran, and easily and evenly distributed in foods, on the other.<br>
Appropriately, some of the aleurone cells of the aleurone cell groups can have weakened cell walls. A weakening of the cell walls which are difficult to digest supports digestion and facilitates the organism's access to the valuable aleurone components. A particular point is that the walls of the aleurone cells can have been weakened by enzymatic, mechanical or chemical means, or e.g. thermal means through steam treatment and/or<br><br><br>
microwave treatment. Combinations of these types of cell wall weakening are also advantageous.<br>
Where required, the aleurone components can be contained in the form of destroyed aleurone cells ("aleurone pulp") and comprise both the total cell content and the total destroyed cell walls of the aleurone content. In this form, the aleurone is practically "pre-digested", and the components of the aleurone cell content can be absorbed particularly easily by the organism, without the organism being deprived of the physiological benefit of the destroyed cell walls of the aleurone. Here again, the aleurone components can - if required - be contained in the form of destroyed aleurone cells ("cell mush"), and comprise at least a part of the total cell content and/ or at least a part of the disturbed cell walls of the aleurone content.<br>
A particular means of supplying the aleurone components and/or the aleurone according to the invention does not comprise any further components apart from aleurone components, and thus merely consists of aleurone. This form of administration is suitable as a food supplement or fodder supplement. It can comprise aleurone cell groups, particularly in flake, granule, pressling or powder form, and can, where required, contain at least partly destroyed aleurone cells ("aleurone pulp").<br>
The aleurone components and/or the aleurone in this form of administration can also comprise the cell content originating from the aleurone cells in its liquid form ("aleurone juice"), which, preferably, has been thickened to make a syrupy fluid ("aleurone syrup"), or diluted to make a runny fluid ("aleurone water").<br>
Appropriately, they consist only of the cell content originating from aleurone cells in its dried form, in particular - here again - in flake, granule, pressling or powder form.<br>
Analogously, they can also comprise only the destroyed cell walls originating from aleurone cells, in particular in flake, granule, pressling or powder form, when they may in particular also contain additional water. This variant constitutes an nutritionally/physiologically valuable form of roughage.<br><br><br>
In a particularly advantageous and preferred variant, the aleurone components and/or the aleurone are/is added in one of the above-mentioned forms to a conventional food, such as e.g. a food or combination of foods from the following food groups:<br>
a)	Basic foods such as flour or semolina made of wheat, rye, rice, corn or soya; fermented or non-fermented milk, animal or vegetable fats; fruit or fruit juice; vegetables or vegetable juice; pure water, mineral water or other enriched waters; meat; fish; etc.<br>
b)	Processed foods, such as cheese, quark or yoghurt; beverages, in particular milk drinks or juices; bakery products in particular bread or pastry; pasta; confectionery, in particular chocolate or jelly bears; breakfast cereals; sandwich spreads; bars; meat substitutes; sausage; etc.<br>
c)	Special foods with specific effects, such as functional food; pharma food; designer food; nutraceuticals; etc.<br>
Pure aleurone, i.e. aleurone without a shell, is white and practically tasteless. In the aforementioned foods or other foods, this enables an addition of aleurone without altering either colour or taste, which leads, however, to an essential increase in the nutritional/physiological value of the food.<br>
In another advantageous variant, the aleurone components and/or the aleurone in one of the aforementioned forms is added to a fodder, such as e.g. a fodder or combination of fodders from the following fodder groups:<br>
a)	Food for domestic animals or pets, such as dog food; cat food; rodent food; fish food; reptile food; amphibian food; bird food; etc.<br>
b)	Fodder for livestock, such as horse fodder; cattle fodder; pig fodder; sheep fodder; poultry fodder; etc.<br>
In another special variant, the aleurone components and/or the aleurone in one of the aforementioned forms is added in a carrier which is neutral to the metabolism and - in<br><br><br>
particular - indigestible. This enables a dilution of the effective substances of the aleurone and a dosage in the form of capsules, bars, etc., when the indigestible carrier comprises an agent or a combination of agents from the following group; insoluble salts; waxes; starch; gelatine; chewing-gum; etc.<br>
The aleurone components and/or the aleurone can also be added to a tasty carrier, in particular a luxury food, such as e.g. an agent or combination of agents from the following group: dextrose; maltose; fruit gum; etc.<br>
In a process according to the invention for the manufacture of a variant of aleurone components and/or aleurone of the aforementioned kind, the aleurone components and/or the aleurone are/is added to a food or fodder in a liquid or powder form easily accessible to the human or animal organism, when the aleurone components and/or the aleurone are/is added to a processed food or a processed fodder during processing in a liquid or powder form easily accessible to the human or animal organism. Therefore, for an intentional weakening of the aleurone cells, a suitable procedural step of the processing of the conventional food can be used, when a separate step for the weakening of the aleurone cells prior to their being mixed in with the conventional food can thus be dispensed with.<br>
A particular point in this context is that intact aleurone or intact aleurone cells or aleurone cell groups are mixed into a processed food or a processed fodder during a step in processing, when the food or fodder is exposed to at least one of the following influences or combinations thereof: enzymatic influence; mechanical influence; in particular shearing, compression, expansion, etc.; thermal influence, in particular through steam and/or microwaves; chemical influence.<br>
In a special variant of the process according to the invention, the mixing in of the total quantity of aleurone components and/or aleurone to be added is distributed among several procedural steps of the food or fodder processing. Thus, some of the aleurone cells added at an earlier stage can be weakened to a more severe extent than some of the aleurone cells added at a later stage.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the processing of the food or fodder takes place constantly, and the aleurone components and/or the aleurone are/is added constantly in at least one of the following forms during the processing of the food or fodder:<br>
&gt;	aleurone particle powder comprising aleurone cells and/or aleurone cell groups<br>
&gt;	aleurone juice from aleurone cell plasma<br>
&gt;	suspended aleurone cells and/or aleurone cell groups<br>
&gt;	diluted aleurone cell plasma<br>
&gt;	thickened aleurone cell plasma<br>
&gt;	granules, pellets, powder etc. made from aleurone cell plasma.<br>
The aforementioned variants according to the invention can be used as food supplements or fodder supplements.<br>
Further advantages, features and means of using the invention are apparent from the following description of some examples, which are to be interpreted as non-restrictive.<br>
In relation to the different variants, "aleurone" is to be interpreted as a more or less disturbed (cell wall weakening) and, as the case may be, more or less complete mass (related to the natural composition of the aleurone) comprising aleurone cell groups and/or single aleurone cells and/or their components.<br>
Use in pasta<br>
The aleurone is, for example, added in quantities of 8,5 to 50 % as a "semolina substitute". Through the use of aleurone in the form of primarily intact aleurone cell groups, a more or less pronounced sandiness can be achieved, depending upon the size of the cell groups, which in most cases is, however, more undesired than otherwise. Therefore, through the addition of aleurone, not only is it possible to improve the pasta from nutritional/physiological aspects, but also influence its sensory properties. Upon a use of pure, practically white aleurone, the appearance of the pasta remains largely unchanged. It has, moreover, transpired that upon the addition of aleurone in the form of larger cell groups (up to 100 aleurone cells or even more), the size of these cell groups decreases<br><br><br>
during the production or processing of the pasta. It can be proven that a "disagglomeration" of these cell groups takes place, and with a sufficiently intensive influence an at least partial weakening of the cell walls. As a result, any undesired sandiness is prevented. The pasta according to the invention thus corresponds to the eating habits among the population (one "cannot taste" the goodness).<br>
Use in cereals<br>
In this context, the aleurone can be e.g. added in the form of flakes or soft and hard cereal bars, when e.g. a simple mixing in or coating aleurone constitutes a means of application.<br>
Use in liquid and semi-liquid products<br>
The aleurone can e.g. be added to yoghurt, sour milk, cream cheese or powder-based beverages (nectars). Here again, and depending upon the size of the cell groups, a more or less pronounced sandiness of the products is achieved. Moreover, the deposit reaction of the added aleurone is strongly dependent upon the size of the aleurone particles (cell components, individual components, cell groups).<br>
Use in beverage powders<br>
The aleurone can e.g. be added to breakfast drinks, energy drinks, athletes' drinks. Again, the accessibility of the aleurone components to the organism, on the one hand, and the sensory properties of the beverage, on the other, can be influenced by the state of the aleurone (cell components, individual cells, cell groups). For example, aleurone juice can be integrated by means of spraying into the finished beverage powder.<br>
Use in paste products<br>
The aleurone can also e.g. be mixed into sandwich spreads such as margarine, butter, sauces, dips, etc. Here again, the accessibility of the components of the aleurone to the organism, on the one hand, and the sensory properties of the beverage, on the other, can be influenced by the state of the aleurone (cell components, individual cells, cell groups).<br>
Use in bread and bakery products<br><br>
In addition to the nutritional/physiological effect, and depending upon the quantity used (e.g. 8,5 to 20%) and state (cell components, individual cells, cell groups), the added aleurone can influence the developments of the dough, its rheology, baking reactions and baking results (properties of crumbs, sensory properties in the interior of the baked product).<br>
Use in boiling extrusion and cold extrusion<br>
The aleurone can be added in the extruder during a suitable procedural step of the processing of the product. Depending upon the state of the added aleurone (cell components, individual cells, cell groups), and according to the procedural step, the added aleurone can be processed to a more or less intensive extent, and thus changed. The added aleurone can therefore be exposed to a made-to-measure combination of enzymatic influence, mechanical influence, in particular shearing, compression, expansion, etc., or thermal influence, in particular through steam. Boiling or cold extrusion is also suitable for the manufacture of "pure aleurone products" in conjunction with a carrier such as starch, further grain bases (e.g. oat bran, flax, etc.) as separately administrable variants of food or fodder supplements in pellet or pressling form.<br><br><br>
Summary:<br>
Through a use of "pure aleurone" in its various forms (cell components, i.e. aleurone mush, aleurone pulp, intact individual cells, cell groups), it is possible to influence the nutritional/physiological and sensory properties of the aleurone. A further influencing of these properties can be achieved through a deliberate omission of specific components (e.g. cell walls in destroyed aleurone, phytin,) of the aleurone. In this manner, it is possible to manufacture very specific foods and fodders with made-to-measure properties. Finally, additional non-aleurone components may be mixed in with the aleurone. This is of particular interest in the production of aleurone-based food supplements.<br>
Finally, it should be mentioned by way of example that e.g. cellulose can also be added to the aleurone or aleurone-based product according to the invention. Whereas, however, cellulose has a practically pure roughage effect (hardly decomposable by intestinal bacteria), the addition of aleurone cell walls (unimpaired, weakened or destroyed) has a supplementary prebiotic effect. The aleurone cell walls predominantly comprising arabinoxylane function as a "breeding ground" or "food" e.g. for Bilfidus bacteria, whose metabolic products, in particular, butyric acid, assist in maintaining a healthy intestine.<br><br>
