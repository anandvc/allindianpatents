				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a crystalline, polymorphic form of (S,S,S)-N-(1 -[2-carboxy-3-(N2-mesyllysylamino)propyl]-1 -cyclopentylcarbonyl)tyrosine which has the formula:-<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
hereafter referred to as the "α-form" of a compound of the formula (l).<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to the α-form of a compound of the formula (I) and to processes for the preparation of, to intermediates used in the preparation of, to compositions containing and to uses of, the α-form.<br>
An amorphous form (hereafter referred to as the "ß-form") of a compound of the formula (I) has been disclosed in European Patent Publication No. EP-α-0358398 as Example 181. The compound is a potent inhibitor of the zinc dependent neutral endopeptidase E.C.3.4.24.11 and is therefore able to potentiate the biological effects of atrial natriuretic factor.  It is therefore a natriuretic, antihypertensive and diuretic agent that is useful for the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. The compound is also a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, a further enzyme that is involved in the control of blood pressure.  The compound therefore has a dual pharmacological action through being capable of inhibiting two key enzymes involved in the control of blood pressure.   It is therefore likely to<br>
be useful in the treatment of various forms of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure and glaucoma.<br>
The ß-form can be obtained by methods such as freeze drying of a solution of the compound of the formula (I), by rapid evaporation of the solvent from such a solution or by precipitation from such a solution by addition of a poor solvent. The ß-form does not melt sharply but normally "softens" at about 160°C.<br>
The 8-form has, however, been found to have certain properties which do not make it particularly suitable for pharmaceutical formulation.  In particular it is hygroscopic in nature, it has a low bulk density and poor flow properties.  Processing experiments carried out using the ß-form have revealed problems in manufacturing tablets from compositions containing this form.<br>
The problem addressed by the present invention is the provision of a form of the compound of the formula (I) which can be efficiently processed to provide a stable and effective formulation of the drug.<br>
This problem has been solved by the surprising finding that an α-form of a compound of the formula (l) can be prepared which is non-hvgroscopic, crvstalline and, when compared to the 3-form, which has a higher bulk density and better flow properties.  The α-form is particularly suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulation of the drug,<br>
The present invention therefore provides a crystalline, polymorphic α-form of a compound of the formula (I) which has an infrα-red spectrum as a mull in nujol which shows absorption bands at v = 3407, 3386, 3223, 3153, 1699, 1652, 1626, 1594, 1516, 1457 (nujol), 1377 (nujol), 1344, 1334, 1317, 1267, 1241, 1228, 1210, 1164, 1151, 1137, 1118, 1109, 1093, 1074, 1045, 1019, 1003, 981, 965, 911, 897, 862, 818, 800, 778, 762, 721 and 655 cm"1.<br>
The α-from is further characterised by its powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained using copper radiation filtered with a graphite monochromator ( = 0.15405nm) which shows main peaks at 7.5, 8.9, 9.9, 11.6, 15.6, 17.2, 17.5, 18.0, 20.2, 22.1 and 23.3 degrees 20.<br>
The α-form is yet further characterised by differential scanning calorimetry in which it shows a sharp endotherm in the range 248-259°C and decomposes at above 260°C when subjected to a scanning rate of 20°C per minute.<br>
The α-form typically melts sharply in the range 242-252°C, although lower melting point ranges have been recorded.<br>
Other forms (hereafter referred to as the "y-" and "8-forms") of a compound of the formula (I) have also been obtained which also form part of the present invention since they can be used as intermediates in the preparation of the α-form.<br>
The invention thus further provides a polymorphic y-form of a compound of the formula (I) which has an infrα-red spectrum as a mull in nujol which shows absorption bands at v = 3377, 3240, 1665, 1639, 1594, 1527, 1518, 1494, 1457 (nujol), 1443, 1377 (nujol), 1344, 1321, 1304, 1254, 1195, 1178, 1162, 1143, 1111, 1098, 1046, 1031, 1012, 972, 962, 945, 932, 907, 879, 849, 815, 806, 780, 753, 729 and 658 cm'1.<br>
The y-form is further characterised by its powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained using copper radiation filtered with a graphite monochromator ( = 0.15405nm) which shows main peaks at 9.0, 9.6, 10.6, 11.6, 12.7, 13.3, 14.6, 16.2, 17.9, 18.8, 20.2 and 21.8 degrees 29.<br>
The y-form is yet further characterised by differential scanning calorimetry in which it shows a sharp endotherm in the range 176-186°C, an exotherm at about 207°C and a weak endotherm at about 213°C and decomposes at above 250°C when subjected to a scanning rate of 20°C per minute.<br>
The y-form typically melts sharply in the range 170-185°C.<br>
The invention thus also provides a hydrated 5-form of a compound of the formula (I) which has a water content of from 1 to 7%, preferably of from 2 to 4%, by weight, as determined by Karl Fischer analysis, and which has an infrα-red spectrum as a mull in nujol which shows absorption bands at v = 3667, 3425, 3380, 3287, 3137, 3098, 1709, 1673, 1637, 1619, 1596, 1568, 1556, 1516, 1458 (nujol), 1448, 1419, 1390, 1378 (nujol), 1356, 1338, 1300, 1270, 1249, 1229, 1198, 1174, 1141, 1108, 1091, 1075, 1064, 1045, 1033, 1019, 1001, 985, 962, 941, 909, 889, 877, 841, 822, 807, 763, 744, 732, 721 and 655 cm-1.<br>
The 8-form is further characterised by its powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained using copper radiation filtered with a graphite monochromator ( = 0.15405nm) which shows main peaks at 10.5, 10.8, 12.3, 14.5, 17.2, 17.6, 17.9, 18.9, 20.4, 21.5, 22.4, 23.0, 23.1, 24.7, 27.1, 27.8 and 28.9 degrees 20.<br>
The 5-form is yet further characterised by differential scanning calorimetry in which it shows sharp endotherms at about 162°C and at about 166-168°C and decomposes at above 200°C when subjected to a scanning rate of 20°C per minute.<br>
The 8-form typically melts sharply in the range 165-175°C.<br>
Although the - and δ-forms of a compound of the formula (I) display the same pharmacological activities as the α- and ß-forms, they are not as suitable as the α-form for the purpose of pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The α-form of a compound of the formula (I) can be prepared by the<br>
following methods:-<br>
1)       The α-form can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of an aqueous solution of a sodium, potassium, ammonium or (C1-C4 alkyl)ammonium salt of a compound of the formula:-<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
using a suitable catalyst for the removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group, e.g. palladium-on-carbon, followed by acidification of the base salt of the compound of the formula (I) obtained to from pH 3 to 5, preferably to about pH4, and preferably at from 35 to 45°C, to provide the α-form.  Preferably a disodium salt of a compound of the formula (II) is used.  Further suitable catalysts for the removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group are well known to the skilled person, e.g. see T.W. Greene and P.G. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Edition, 1991, the teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference. In a typical procedure, a solution of a compound of the formula (II) in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, is shaken with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to generate a disodium salt thereof.  The aqueous solution containing the sodium salt is then separated and hydrogenated in the presence of a 5% palladium-on-carbon catalyst at about 414kPa (60 psi) and room temperature to remove the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group. The catalyst is then removed by filtration and the filtrate adjusted to about pH 4 using a suitable acid, e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid. The α-form is precipitated from solution and can be collected by filtration.<br>
A compound of the formula (II) can be prepared by the route set out in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In a typical procedure, t-butyl acrylate (III) is reacted with paraformaldehyde in the presence of 3-quinuclidinol to provide t-butyl hydroxymethylacrylate (IV).  This is first treated with thionyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine and pyridine to provide the corresponding chloromethylacrylate, which is then reacted with (S,S)-α-α'-dimethyldibenzylamine to provide an acrylate of the formula (V). This is converted to a compound of the formula (IX) by the method set out in Tet. Lett., 1993, 34(8). 1323-6.  A compound of the formula (IX) is then condensed with a lysine derivative of the formula (X) by a similar procedure to that described in EP-α-0358398 for the preparation of a compound of the formula (XI).  A compound of the formula (XI) is then converted to a compound of the formula (II) using a solution of trifluoroacetic acid and anisole in dichloromethane.<br>
The α-form can be prepared from the 8-form by stirring a solution of the 8-form in water or in an aqueous solution of a suitable organic solvent, e.g. a C1-C4 alkanol such as methanol or isopropanol, or a C3-C6 alkanone such as acetone.<br>
In a typical procedure the S-form is dissolved in a 1:5 water/methanol or a 1:10 water/acetone mixture and the solution stirred for several days at room temperature. The α-form precipitates from the solution and can be collected by filtration.<br>
The α-form can be prepared from the -form by stirring a solution of the y-form in water or in an aqueous solution of a suitable organic solvent, e.g. a C,-C4 alkanol such as methanol or isopropanol, or a C3-C6 alkanone such as acetone.<br>
 In a typical procedure the y-form is dissolved in a 1:1 water/methanol mixture and the solution stirred for about 17 hours at room temperature. The α-form precipitates from the solution and can be collected by filtration.<br>
4)	The α-form can be prepared from the 8-form by a similar procedure to that set out in Method (3) above.<br>
5)	The α-form can be prepared by deprotection, preferably under acidic conditions, of a compound of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein P1, P2, P3 and P4 are all suitable protecting groups that are capable of removal, preferably under acidic conditions, to provide, following adjustment of the pH to from 3 to 5, preferably about 4, in the work-up, the α-form.<br>
Suitable protecting groups for this purpose together with conditions for their removal will be well known to the skilled person, e.g. see T.W. Greene, and P.G. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Edition, Wiley-lnterscience.  P1 is preferably formyl or benzyloxycarbonyl.  P2, P3 and P4 are preferably each t-butyl.<br><br>
In a typical procedure where P1 is formyl or benzyloxycarbonyl and P2, P3 and P4 are each t-butyl, a solution of a compound of the formula (XII) in a suitable solvent, e.g. 1,4-dioxane or ethyl acetate, is treated with a suitable acid, e.g. hydrogen chloride, to remove to the protecting groups and adjustment of the pH to about 4 in the work-up provided the α-form.<br>
The intermediates of the formula (XII) may be prepared by conventional techniques.  The compound of the formula (XII) where P1 is benzyloxycarbonyl and P2, P3 and P4 are each t-butyl corresponds to the compound of the formula (XI) in Scheme 1, the synthesis of which is further described in Method (1).  The compound of the formula (XII) where P1 is formyl and P2, P3 and P4 are each t-butyl may be prepared by first removing the benzyloxycarbonyl group from the compound of the formula (XI) by hydrogenolysis using a suitable catalyst, e.g. palladium-on-carbon, followed by formylation of the amine obtained, e.g. using formic acetic anhydride.<br>
The α-form can be prepared by deprotection, preferably under acidic conditions, of a compound of the formula:-<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein P5 is a suitable protecting group that is capable of removal, preferably under acidic conditions, to provide, following adjustment of the pH to from 3 to 5, preferably about 4, in the work-up, the α-form. Suitable protecting groups for this purpose together with conditions for their removal will be well known to the skilled person, e.g. see T.W. Greene and P.G. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Edition, Wiley-lnterscience.  P5 is preferably formyl and further examples of P5 are benzyloxycarbonyl and tert-butyloxycarbonyl.<br>
In a typical procedure where P5 is formyl, a solution of a compound of the formula (XIII) in a suitable solvent, e.g. 1,4-dioxane, is treated with an aqueous solution of a suitable acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, to remove the protecting group and adjustment of the pH to about 4 in work-up provided the α-form.<br>
The intermediates of the formula (XIII) may be prepared by conventional techniques, such as by selective deprotection of a compound of the formula (XII) to remove the P2, P3 and P4 protecting groups alone.   For example, where P1 is formyl and P2, P3 and P4 are each t-butyl, the t-butyl protecting groups may be selectively removed by treatment of a compound of the formula (XII) with trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichioromethane.<br>
The ß-, - and ß-forms that are used as intermediates in preparing the α-form can be prepared as follows:-<br>
The 6-form can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of a solution of a compound of the formula (II) in a suitable solvent and in the presence of a suitable catalyst for the removal of the protecting group, e.g. palladium-on-carbon.<br>
In a typical procedure, a solution of a compound of the formula (II) in aqueous ethanol is hydrogenated at about 414kPa (60 psi) and room temperature in the presence of a palladium-on-carbon catalyst. The catalyst is then removed by filtration and the filtrate is either concentrated under reduced pressure to provide a foam that is stirred with a C3-C6 alkanone, e.g. acetone, or freeze dried, to provide the 6-form that can be collected by filtration. This preparation has also, if the C3-C6 alkanone treatment is used, occasionally provided the α-form.<br>
The 8-form can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of a solution of a compound of the formula (II) in a mixture of a suitable water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, and water and in the presence of a suitable catalyst for the removal of the protecting group, e.g. palladium-on-carbon, followed by removaLof.the catalyst,, separation of the aqueous layer and precipitation of the.product from the aqueous layer using a C1-C4 alkanol, e.g. methanol. In a typical procedurer.water is added to a solution of a compound of the formula (II) in ethyl acetate and the mixture is hydrogenated at about 414kPa (60 psi) and room temperature in the presence of a palladium-on-carbon catalyst. The catalyst is then removed by filtration, the aqueous phase separated from the filtrate, concentrated under reduced pressure to a low volume and poured into methanol. The ß-form slowly precipitates from the solution and can be collected by filtration.<br>
This preparation has also occasionally provided the α-form.<br>
(iii)        The ß-form can be prepared by first freezing an aqueous solution of the ß-form and then freeze drying the resulting solid mass.<br>
(iv)        The -form can be prepared by stirring the 8-form with n-propanol or acetonitrile.<br>
In a typical procedure the mixture is stirred for about 24 hours at room temperature and the y-form is collected by filtration.<br>
(v)	The -form can be prepared bv stirring a slurry of the ß-form in<br>
acetonitrile or n-propanol, typically for about 5 days at room ternperature. Th ey fo rm is collected by fiItration.<br>
(vi)       The y-fbrm can be prepared by treating an aqueous solution of the 6-form with a C3-C6 alkanone, e.g. acetone. In a typical procedure an aqueous solution of the δ-form is poured into a vigorously stirred volumetric excess of acetone at room temperature.   The -form precipitates from solution and can be collected by filtration. This preparation has also occasionally provided the α-form.<br>
(vii)       The ß-form can be prepared by freeze drying a concentrated, aqueous solution of the α-form.<br>
In a typical procedure, a concentrated solution of the α-form in hot water is prepared, the solution filtered to remove any insoluble material, then cooled, frozen and finally freeze dried to provide the ß-form.<br>
As previously mentioned, the α-forrn is a potent inhibitor of the neutral endopeptidase (E.C.3.4.24.11). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a number of peptide hormones and peptide autocoid substances including, in particular, the breakdown of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Thus the α-form, by preventing the degradation of ANF by neutral endopeptidase E.C.3.4.24.11, can potentiate the biological effects of ANF and is therefore a diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive agent of utility in the treatment of a number of disorders including hypertension, heart failure, angina, renal insufficiency, chronic renal failure, premenstrual syndrome, cyclical oedema, Menieres disease, hyperaldosteroneism (primary and secondary) and hypercalciuria.  In addition, because of its ability to potentiate the effects of ANF, the α-form is useful in the treatment of glaucoma.  Further, as a result of its ability to inhibit the neutral endopeptidase E.C.3.4.24.11, the α-form may be useful in treating asthma, inflammation, pain, epilepsy, affective disorders, dementia, geriatric confusion, obesity, gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome) and hyperreninaemia and in the modulation of gastric acid secretion.<br>
The activity against neutral endopeptidase E.C.3.4.24.11 can be assessed using a procedure based on the assay described by Barclay, P.L., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 1989, 164. 58-65.  The method involves determining the concentration of compound required to reduce by 50% the rate of release of radiolabeled hippuric acid from hippuryl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine by a neutral endopeptidase preparation from rat kidney.<br>
As previously mentioned, the α-form is also an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).  As such it is useful in treating a variety of conditions for which ACE inhibitors are known to be useful including hypotension, congestive heart failure, limitation of ischaemic damage to the myocardium, protection of the kidney against hyperfiltration damage, prevention or reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, memory enhancement, control of cognitive function, dementia and preventing reocclusion following coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.   Its activity against this enzyme can be assessed using a procedure which is based on a modification of the assay described by Rohrbach, M.S., Anal. Biochem., 1978, 84, 272.  The method involves determining the concentration of compound required to reduce by 50% the extent of release of radiolabeled hippuric acid from hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine by angiotensin converting enzyme isolated from the rat kidney.<br>
Inhibitory activity can also be measured in vivo following intravenous injection to anaesthetised rats using the methods described by I.L. Natoff et al, Journal of Pharmacological Methods, 1981, 5, 305 and by D.M. Gross et al, J. Pharmacol, Exp. Ther., 1981, 216. 552.  The dose of the inhibitor that is required to reduce the pressor response produced by intravenous injection of angiotensin I (50 ng bolus) by 50% is determined.<br>
The activity of the α-form as a diuretic agent can be determined by measuring its ability to increase urine output and sodium ion excretion in conscious AV-blocked dogs using the methods described by Alabaster, C.T., et al. Brit. J. Pharmacol., 1989, 98, 823P.<br>
The antihypertensive activity of the α-form can be evaluated by measuring the fall in blood pressure following oral or intravenous administration to salt depleted, diuretic primed, spontaneously hypertensive rats, salt depleted renally hypertensive dogs, or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt hypertensive rats.<br>
For administration to an animal in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency, oral dosages of the α-form will generally be in the range of 1-500mg daily, and preferably 5-200mg daily for the treatment of human beings, for an average adult patient.  Thus for a typical adult human patient, individual tablets or capsules contain from 1 to 200mg of the compound in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier for administration singly, or in multiple doses, once or several times a day.  Dosages for intravenous administration would typically be from 0.01 to 50mg, preferably 0.1 to 10mg, of compound per single dose as required.  In practice the physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.  The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
For human use, the α-form can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.   For example, it may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or dibasic calcium phosphate, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of an elixir or a suspension containing flavouring or colouring agents.  It may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  For parenteral administration, it is best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood.<br>
The α-form may be co-administered with other agents that are useful for the control of blood pressure, the treatment of cardiac conditions or renal insufficiency. Thus, for example, it may be co-administered with a cardiac stimulant, for example digitalis, an alphα-blocker, for example doxazosin, a betα-blocker, a calcium channel blocker, for example amiodipine, exogenous ANF, a potassium channel activator or with another diuretic agent as shall be determined by the physician with regard to the particular patient or disease state.<br>
Therapeutic treatment by use of the α-form as disclosed herein can mean curative or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease.<br>

An instrumented tablet machine (Manesty Machines Limited, Model F3) was satisfactorily calibrated for force and upper punch displacement.<br>
When calibrated, a placebo Avicel (trade mark)/DCP (dibasic calcium phosphate) blend was processed on the machine using 13mm flat faced punches to measure the reproducibility of the technique.  Using an aliquot of the blend, the machine was adjusted appropriately to achieve the target compression weight (400mg) and sufficient hardness. Twenty unit aliquots were then separately weighed and loaded into the shoe of the machine.  The machine was operated under power until the blend in the shoe had been exhausted and no further tablets were produced.  Figure 13 shows a plot of upper punch force as a function of the number of tablets for three Avicel/DCP placebo blends, each of twenty units, and Table 5 shows the mean weight and hardness of the ten heaviest tablets (assumed to be the first ten produced).  It can be seen from the data presented in Figure 13 that the overall process, for this blend, was very reproducible. The decrease in upper punch force that occurred at the end of the run can be correlated with the reduction in the amount of blend in the shoe and consequential poor filling of the die.<br>

Table showing the mean weight and hardness of tablets produced using an Avicel/DCP placebo blend.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Following the experiment to determine the reproducibility of the technique, blends containing the α-form or the ß-form were separately prepared according to the following formulation: α- or 3-form (100mg), pregelatinsed starch (40mg), dibasic calcium phosphate (anhydrous grade) (256mg) and magnesium stearate (2mg).  A blend/screen/blend process was used to manufacture 20g of the blend prior to slugging on the machine. The loading was 100mg as previous experience had indicated that the higher the loading, the more processing difficulties that were encountered. The machine was adjusted for the blend and then 50 tablets were produced from the particular blend in one continuous batch.<br>
Optimisation of the machine was more difficult with the ß-form blend due to its poor flow properties.  Despite careful manipulation of the process variables, it was not possible to maintain the upper punch force constant between both blends and consequently the ß-form blend was compressed to a greater hardness.<br>
The upper punch data are shown for both blends in Figure 14.  The large variability in upper punch force (and tablet weight) for the ß-form blend was associated with the non-uniform filling of the die for this formulation. The data presented in Table 6 confirms that processing of the ß-form formulation was much more difficult and was subject to much greater variability than if the α-form formulation was used.<br>

Table showing the variability in processing parameters for blends<br>
containing the α- and 8-forms.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The measured ejection force for the last ten tablets of each blend is shown in Figure 15.  The tablets formed from the ß-form required much greater force to remove them from the die. This effect manifested itself in the tablets being "flipped" from the die by the shoe.<br>
The data obtained shows the poor processing properties of the ß-form as compared to the α-form.  The ß-form has a low bulk density (fluff density = 0.09g ml"1, compared with 0.36g ml"1 for the α-form) and poor flow properties and when blends containing it are tabletted, a large variability in tablet weight results and a high ejection force is required. In all these respects, the α-form has been shown to exhibit superior properties making it particularly suitable for pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Hygroscopicity study<br>
(i)	The hygroscopicity of the α- and ß-forms was assessed by<br>
gravimetric analysis as follows.<br>
Samples of the α- and ß-forms were separately placed in Kilner (trade mark) jars under the following conditions: 40°C; 40°C and 75%RH (relative humidity); and 40°C and 95%RH.  Water uptake of each sample was assessed gravimetrically, in triplicate, after selected time intervals.<br>
Samples of the ß-form stored at 40°C/75%RH or 40°C/95%RH for 1 day underwent a morphological change.  Samples of the ß-form stored at 40°C/95%RH for 1 day underwent a small weight loss (presumably after a weight increase due to water absorption followed by the morphological change and then moisture loss), whereas samples stored at 40°C/75%RH gained, on average, 6% of their original weight.<br>
Figure 16 shows the results obtained from the gravimetric analysis.  The α-form was not found to be hygroscopic.   However the ß-form was found to be very hygroscopic at 40°C/75%RH.<br>
(ii)	Moisture microbalance experiments on the α- and B-<br>
forms confirmed that the α-form was not hygroscopic whereas the ß-form was very hygroscopic. Samples of the α- and ß-forms were separately placed in the apparatus at 40°C and allowed to equilibrate with the surroundings prior to the particular sample being exposed to increasing relative humidities, with equilibration periods between each increase in humidity. The results are shown in Figure 17. These indicate that as much as 8% by weight of water (cf. original weight) was taken up by the ß-form during the experiment.<br>
The morphological change that the ß-form underwent at high humidities was further studied and a transformation from a very low bulk density powder to a dense glassy solid was observed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
