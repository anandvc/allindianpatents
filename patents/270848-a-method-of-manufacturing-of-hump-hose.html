PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
A METHOD OF MAKING FLEXIBLE COUPLING FOR VEHICULAR<br>
AIR-INTAKE SYSTEMS<br>
FLEETGUARD FILETRS PVT. LIMITED<br>
An Indian Company<br>
of Kirloskar House, 100 Ananad Park, Aundh, Pune-411 0007,<br>
Maharashtra India.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to hoses.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to hump hoses.<br>
Background of the invention: Introduction:<br>
A hose is basically a hollow tube. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical with a circular cross section. Hoses find application in various industries, in vehicle and the like. Hoses are usually a one piece device which is manufactured through process of moulding. In vehicles hoses are placed in the air filter mechanism and connect the air intake to air cleaner. In vehicles the hoses not only carry air but also provided compressive humping action which protects the air filter from shocks and vibrations. The hoses may be manufactured in a manner such that there are provided a plurality of humps and convolutions on the cylindrical surface.<br>
Moulding is the process of manufacturing an object in a particular form or shape with the help of a rigid frame or a model called a mould. A mould is a hollow block, which is filled with liquid materials of varying degree of viscosity. The liquid in question could be molten glass, plastic, glass, metal or ceramic raw material. There are different types of moulding processes such as injection moulding, rotational moulding, press moulding, compression moulding, blow moulding and the like.<br>
Compression molding is a method of molding in which the molding material, generally preheated, is first placed in an open, heated mold cavity. The mold is closed with a top force or plug member, pressure is applied to<br>
2<br><br>
force the material into contact with all mold areas, and heat and pressure are maintained until the molding material has cured. The process employs thermosetting resins in a partially cured stage, either in the form of granules, putty-like masses or preforms. Compression molding is a high-volume, high-pressure method suitable for molding complex, high-strength fiberglass reinforcements. Advanced composite thermoplastics can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes, woven fabrics, randomly orientated fiber mat or chopped strand. The advantage of compression molding is its ability to mold large, fairly intricate parts.<br>
Blow moulding is a manufacturing process by which hollow plastic parts are formed. In general, there are three main types of blow moulding: Extrusion Blow Moulding, Injection Blow Moulding, and Stretch Blow Moulding. These methods of blow moulding are used extensively in the bottling and packaging industry. These moulding processes are capable of manufacturing plastic storage bottles exhibiting high reliability and which are aesthetically appealing.<br>
Prior art:<br>
Hump hoses known in the prior art are made of EPDM rubber and manufactured by the process of compression moulding. The humps provided on the hoses are in the form of annular rings provided on the surface of the hose. Typically, number of humps provided on a hose is in the range of 1 to 4. Hump hoses used in vehicle have to withstand high stress, pressure, vibrations and shocks. To protect hump hoses known in the prior art from vacuum collapse the thickness of the hose was at least 6.75mm. Thickness of the hose increases the weight and the production cost of the hose known in the prior art. Typically, weight of the hose known in the prior art is 0.90 kg.<br>
3<br><br>
Time required for manufacturing of a hose using compression moulding technique is in the range of 20-30 minutes. Further the process of compression moulding is slow in high volume of manufacturing is not possible using a single mould. Use of multiple moulds increase the expense incurred in manufacturing the hump hose.<br>
This invention seeks to overcome the limitations of the prior art.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a simple and inexpensive method for the manufacture of hump hose.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a method for manufacturing hump hose which is capable of withstanding higher stress, pressure, vibrations and shocks without cracking.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In   accordance   with   this   invention  there   is   provided   a  method   for<br>
manufacturing of hump hoses, said method comprising the following steps:<br>
Step 1: preparing a mixture of poly propylene and EPDM rubber;<br>
Step 2: removing impurities present in the mixture;<br>
Step 3: making a die adapted to blow mould a hump hose;<br>
Step 4: introducing a mixture poly propylene and EPDM rubber into the die;<br>
Step 5: performing blow moulding operation;<br>
Step 6: removing the blow moulded hump hose from the die;<br>
Step 7: performing de-flashing operation on the blow moulded hump hose;<br>
Step 8: inserting a spring inside the hump hose; and<br>
Step 9: inspection of the hump hose.<br>
4<br><br>
Typically, the concentration of poly propylene in the mixture is in the range<br>
of 65 to 80% by weight.<br>
Typically, the concentration of EPDM rubber in the mixture is in the range<br>
of 3 5 to 20% by weight.<br>
Typically, the entire operation is carried out a temperature ranging from<br>
170° C to 200° C.<br>
Typically, the time taken for the entire operation is in the range of 1.5 to 3<br>
minutes.<br>
Typically, the thickness of the wall of the hump hose is 3mm.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to a preferred<br>
embodiment. Reference to this embodiment does not limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure  1  illustrates a flowchart representing the steps involved in the<br>
manufacturing of the hump hose in accordance with this invention.;<br>
Detailed description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
The invention will now be explained with reference to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a flowchart representing the steps involved in the manufacturing of the hump hose in accordance with this invention. The steps followed in the manufacture are as follows: Step 1: preparing a mixture of poly propylene and EPDM rubber;<br>
5<br><br>
Step 2: removing impurities present in the mixture;<br>
Step 3: making a die adapted to blow mould a hump hose;<br>
Step 4: introducing a mixture poly propylene and EPDM rubber into the die;<br>
Step 5: performing blow moulding operation;<br>
Step 6: removing the blow moulded hump hose from the die;<br>
Step 7: performing de-flashing operation on the blow moulded hump hose;<br>
Step 8: inserting a spring inside the hump hose; and<br>
Step 9: inspection of the hump hose.<br>
The raw materials used in the manufacture of the hump hose in accordance with this invention are poly propylene and EPDM rubber. Poly propylene in an amount ranging from 65 to 80% by weight and EPDM rubber in an amount ranging from 35 to 20% are mixed. The mixture is then inspected for any impurities that may be present. A die which is adapted to be used for blow moulding a hump hose is then prepared. The mixture is then introduced into the die and blow moulding operation is performed at a temperature ranging from 170° C to 200° C. The time required for moulding is approximately 2 minutes. Blow moulding operation comprises the following steps: parison extrusion step, blowing step, exhaust step and clamping step. The blow moulded hump hose is then removed from the die and de-flashing operation is performed. A spring of thickness approximately 3mm is then inserted in the hump hose. The spring insertion operation is performed as follows: the spring is stretched by pulling it from both end thus the diameter of the spring is reduced. The spring is then inserted into the hump hose. The spring is then released, which fits into the inner wall of the hump hose. The hump hose with the inserted spring is then inspected for defects and cracks.<br>
