				<td>Method for resolution of a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, especially a pinocembrin racemate<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the pharmaceutical field. Specifically, the present invention relates to a method for resolution of a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, especially a pinocembrin racemate, into enantiomers with single configuration.<br>
Background Art<br>
Pinocembrin	has	a	chemical	name	of<br>
2,3-Dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-phenyl-4H-	1 -benzopyran-4-one.<br>
Pinocembrin is a flavanone compound having one chiral center in its chemical structure. Natural pinocembrin has a steric structure of S-configuration and a specific rotation  [α]D15  of-45.3 (c, 0.9, acetone as solvent). Pinocembrin can be separated from propolis as well as plants such as Pinus cembra. Eucalyptus sieberi, Alnus sieboldiana in a relatively low level. Accordingly, the complete synthesis thereof has been studied in the art and pinocembrin in form of racemate can be prepared in large scale (DUAN Yabo, et al., Chinese Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 16(6): 342-346, 2006).<br>
Pinocembrin has one chiral carbon in its molecule and thus has a pair of enantiomers i.e., (R)-pinocembrin and (S)-pinocembrin. Natural pinocembrin is (S)-pinocembrin, but its content in plants is very low and thus can not be obtained in large scale, whereas the studies on biological activities of (R)-pinocembrin are not found yet. In addition, pinocembrin has not a salt-forming acidic or basic group in its structure, so that the<br>
optical resolution of pinocembrin can not be performed by a conventional method of forming diastereomer salts. Currently, none of other methods such as crystallization, mechanical method or selective adsorption is found suitable for the resolution.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need for a method for resolution of racemic pinocembrin to obtain a pinocembrin enantiomer with single configuration.<br>
Contents of the Invention<br>
It was found surprisingly by the inventors that a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, in particular a pinocembrin racemate, can be effectively resolved by using a chiral primary amine or a chiral sulfinamide as resolving agent.<br>
In one respect, therefore, the present invention provides a method for resolution of a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, in particular a pinocembrin racemate, comprising performing the resolution by using a chiral primary amine or a chiral sulfmamide as resolving agent. In one embodiment, the method comprises the following steps: (1) converting a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, in particular a pinocembrin racemate, into a mixture of diastereoisomer derivatives by using a chiral primary amine or a chiral sulfinamide; (2) separating and dederivatizing the pair of diastereoisomers by utilizing their different physical properties to obtain (R)-(+)-pinocembrin and (S)-(-)-pinocembrin with optical activity. Optionally, dederivatizing the separated and purified diastereoisomers comprises hydrolization, reduction and optional purification thereof to obtain single enantiomers of pinocembrin.<br>
In a further respect, the present invention provides a (R)-pinocembrin<br>
obtainable from racemic pinocembrin by the method of resolution according to the present invention.<br>
Specific Models for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for resolution of a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers, in particular a pinocembrin racemate, comprising the following steps: (1) derivatizing the mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers to be separated to form a mixture of diastereoisomer derivatives by using a chiral primary amine or a chiral sulfinamide in an organic solvent; (2) separating the diastereoisomer derivatives and dederivatizing the separated isomers to obtain (R)-(+)-pinocembrin and (S)-(-)-pinocembrin with optical activity.<br>
The present invention is suitable for various mixtures of pinocembrin optical isomers which needs to be resolved into (R)-pinocembrin and (S)-pinocembrin, in which (R)-pinocembrin and (S)-pinocembrin exist in any ratio. In one embodiment, the mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers is a racemic pinocembrin.<br>
In the present invention, pinocembrin may be directly derivatized by using a chiral primary amine or chiral sulfinamide to achieve resolution without any pre-treatment. Alternatively, the phenol hydroxyl group of pinocembrin can be optionally protected with a protective group before the derivation of using the chiral primary amine or chiral sulfonamide, and the protective group can be removed after the derivation reaction or the resolution of isomers in R-form and S-form.<br>
In one embodiment, therefore, the phenol hydroxyl group of pinocembrin to be resolved is protected. The protective group can be benzyl, methyl, acetyl, methoxymethyl and the like, as well as other groups suitable for<br>
protecting phenol hydroxy! group known to those skilled in the art. As for these protective groups and methods for protection and deprotection, reference can be made to, for example, Greene Woods, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Publishing House of East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 2004. In one embodiment of this respect, the protective group is a benzylation agent. Preferably, the benzylation agent is benzyl chloride or benzyl bromide. More preferably, the benzylation agent is benzyl chloride. The reaction for protection of phenol hydroxyl group of pinocembrin may be performed at any suitable temperature. Preferably, the reaction temperature is from 0°C to 150°C, and more preferably from 60°C to 80°C. Optionally, the protection reaction is performed in the presence of a base. The base can be selected from sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium iodide (see also the protection of phenol hydroxyl group in Example 1), ammonium carbonate and the like. The amount of the base can be determined readily by those skilled in the art according to conventional technical means.<br>

The chiral primary amines or chiral sulfonamides used in the present invention preferably are of optically pure.<br>
In the resolution method of the present invention, the chiral primary amine or chiral sulfonamide can be used in any suitable ratio to the pinocembrin mixture especially pinocembrin racemate to be resolved. Preferably, the molar ratio of the chiral primary amine or chiral sulfonamide to the pinocembrin mixture to be separated is 10:1 to 1:1, more preferably 1:1.<br>
The derivation reaction of the mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers with chiral primary amine or chiral sulfonamide according to the present invention can be performed in any suitable organic solvent. The organic<br>
solvent can be selected from but not be limited to the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, petroleum ether, ethyl ether, benzene, toluene, DMF, THF and any combination thereof.<br>

Said methods can be chromatography, crystallization or extraction, etc. In one preferable embodiment, the product of the derivation reaction is separated through chromatography, especially column chromatography. The chromatography may separate the diastereomer derivatives of pinocembrin by utilizing their different polarity to obtain a less polar<br>
single isomer and a more polar single isomer.<br>
Further, the pinocembrin optical isomer derivatives obtained in step (2) is dederivatized by using a suitable method.<br>
*<br>
In one embodiment, the dederivation can be achieved by a hydrolization reaction. The hydrolization reaction can be performed in an organic solvent.

Preferably, the acid is HCl aqueous solution of a concentration of 10% in the hydrolization system.<br>
If a mixture of pinocembrin optical isomers to be resolved is protected prior to the resolution, the above protected pinocembrin optical isomers can be optionally deprotected after the dederivation is finished. As described above, those skilled in the art know well the protection method of the protected phenolic hydroxyl group, which can be performed by, for example, comprising a reduction reaction.
