				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to the crankcase<br>
Structure of a fourinternal combustion engine<br>
adopting a cam chain system for operating a valve and provided with a belt-type continuously variable transmission.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In this type of four-cycle internal combustion engine, as a crankshaft pierces the partition wall of a crankcase for partitioning a belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber off a cam chain chamber in which lubricating oil is used, a sealing member is pressfitted into the through hole of the crankshaft through the partition wall to prevent the oil from<br>
leaking into the belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber.<br>
Such structure is also disclosed in Japanese published examined patent application No. Hei 5-47437 and in this patent application, a circular hole with a large diameter is formed through the partition wall for partitioning the cam chain chamber and the belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber, a hollow disclike capping member blocks the circular hole and is fixed by a screw, and the crankshaft pierces the central through hole of the capping member.<br>
The sealing member blocks a through hole a little larger than the diameter of the crankshaft through this capping member.<br>
Therefore, as a large opening is open through the partition wall by removing this capping member" in the maintenance of the internal combustion engine, the cam chain wound on a driving sprocket can be detached through the opening. [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, as such a capping member which is different from a partition wall is required and a fixture such as a screw for attaching the capping member is required, the mechanism is complicated and the number of parts is increased.<br>
In the case of the conventional internal combustion engine which does not use such a capping member, a method of dividing a crankcase into which right and left parts are integrated into the right and left parts is only one method to detach a cam chain for maintenance and the work is extremely troublesome.<br>
The present invention is made to solve such problems and the object is to provide the crankcase structure of a four-cycle internal combustion engine wherein a belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber is blocked tightly off a cam chain chamber with a small number of parts and the cam chain can be readily attached or detached in maintenance.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems] To achieve the above-described object, the present invention provides the crankcase structure of a<br>
four-cycle internal combustion engine wherein in the four-cycle internal combustion engine in which a crankshaft pierces a partition wall of a crankcase for partitioning a cam chain chamber and a belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber and a sealing member blocks the through hole, the circular sealing member with a larger outside diameter than the maximum outside diameter in a state in which a cam chain is wound on a cam chain driving sprocket engaged with the crankshaft blocks the through hole.<br>
As a through hole with a larger outside<br>
diameter than the maximum outside diameter in a state in which the cam chain is wound on the cam chain driving sprocket is open by removing the circular sealing member for blocking the through hole through the partition wall of the crankcase if the cam chain is detached from the cam chain driving sprocket in maintenance, the cam chain can be readily detached from the cam chain driving sprocket utilizing the through hole, the work for attachment and detachment is facilitated because only a small number of parts are used and the maintainability can be enhanced.<br>
When the circular sealing member blocks the through hole, the crankcase structure of a four-cycle internal combustion engine according to Claim 1 wherein the peripheral edge of the circular sealing member is located close to a cam plate sliding boss provided on the half on the movable side of a pulley of a belt-type continuously variable transmission can be realized and therefore, high maintainability can be kept because the sealing member is not touched to the belt driving pulley.<br>
When the crankcase structure of a four-cycle internal combustion engine according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein a difference in level is formed on the peripheral edge of the side of the circular sealing member on the side of the belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber is realized, the sealing member pressfitted into the through hole can be readily detached utilizing the difference in level and work for maintenance can be further facilitated.<br>
[Preferred Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
An embodiment according to the present invention will be described below referring to Figs. 1 to 4.<br>
Accordingly,   the   present   invention   relates   to   the   crankcase<br>

crankshaft pierces the partition wall of a crankcase for partitioning a cam chain chamber and a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
chamber and a sealing member blocks the through hole, wherein: said circular sealing member with a large outside diameter than the maximum outside diameter in a state in which a cam chain is wound on a cam chain driving sprocket engaged with the crankshaft, blocks said through hole.<br>

transmission 35 and is discharged outside from the exhaust duct 36b. This four-cycle internal combustion engine 30 is constituted as described above, the above-described belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber 70 is partitioned tightly by the circular sealing member 72 with a large diameter to prevent oil from leaking, as the through hole 71a with a large diameter is open by removing the sealing member 72 in the maintenance of the belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber 70, the cam chain 51 can be readily removed and wound from/on the driving sprocket 55, the swing unit case 31 is not required to be disassembled right and left, no special capping member is required, the number of parts is small, the structure is simple and the maintenance is simplified. Though the circular sealing member 72 has a large diameter, it is large to the extent that the peripheral edge of the circular sealing member approaches the cam plate sliding boss 78a with which the slide piece 80a on the periphery of the approaching cam plate 80 is engaged so that the slide piece can be slid<br>
and the sealing member 72 can be arranged without being touched to the belt driving pulley 76 so that the maintenance is simplified.<br>
Next, an example in which the sealing member is transformed will be described referring to Fig. 5.<br>
The structure of an internal combustion engine except this sealing member 120 is the same as that in the above-described embodiment and the same reference numbers are used.<br>
Referring to this sealing member 120<br>
pressfitted into a flat cylindrical through hole 71a of a partition wall 71 formed in a crankcase 31a of a left unit case 31L, a steel plate 122a is embedded in an outer annulus 121a and an outside wall 121c of a rubber member 121 consisting of the outer annulus 121a, an inner annulus 121b and the outside wall 121c and a ferrule 122b is fitted on the periphery of the inner annulus 121b substantially as the above-described sealing member 72, however, a difference in level 123 is formed in the bent part ranging from the outside wall 121c to the outer annulus 121a.<br>
When such a sealing member 120 is pressfitted into the through hole 71a, the outside wall 121c is protruded outside from the opening of the through hole 71a through the difference in level 123, a hollow disclike falling preventing plate 124 presses the end face of the flat cylindrical through hole 71a and the difference in level 123 from the left direction and the falling preventing plate 124 is fixed on a boss 125 for attaching a screw of a crankcase 31a by a screw 126. The falling preventing plate 124 presses the difference in level 123 with its hollow circular opening reduced by the difference in level 123 of the sealing member 120 and fitted to the periphery of the protruded outside wall 121c to prevent the sealing member 120 from falling. Therefore, as the outside wall 121c of the sealing member 120 is a little protruded and exposed from the through hole 71a if the screw 126 is loosened and the falling preventing plate 124 is detached, the sealing member 120 can be readily detached utilizing this exposed outside wall 121c and the maintenance can be further facilitated.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention, as a through hole larger than the maximum outside diameter in a state in which a cam chain is wound on a cam chain driving sprocket is formed when a circular sealing member for blocking a through hole formed through the partition wall of a crankcase is removed if the cam chain is detached from the cam chain driving sprocket in maintenance, the cam chain can be readily detached from the cam chain driving sprocket utilizing the through hole, attachment and detachment can be facilitated because the number of parts is small and the maintainability can be enhanced. When the circular sealing member is attached with it blocking the through hole, the inside of the crankcase is constituted so that the peripheral edge of the circular sealing member is located close to a cam plate sliding boss provided on the half on the movable side of a pulley of a belt-type continuously variable transmission and therefore, the inside of the crankcase can be constituted without the sealing member being<br>
touched to a belt driving pulley so that high maintainability is kept.<br>
The sealing member pressfitted into the through hole can be readily detached utilizing a difference in level by forming the difference in level on the peripheral edge of the side of the circular sealing member on the side of a belt-type continuously variable transmission chamber and the maintenance can be further facilitated. 30.
