Claim for Priority<br>
This non-provisional application claims the benefit of the filing date of<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/387,749, of the same title, filed May 7,<br>
2009. The priority of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/387,749 is hereby<br>
claimed and the disclosure thereof is incorporated into this application by<br>
reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a process for the production of<br>
vinyl ester from a carboxylic acid and acetylene. Specifically, the present<br>
invention relates to a series of heterogeneous catalyst systems that are suitable for<br>
the production of vinyl ester from a reaction of acetylene with a variety of<br>
carboxylic acids. In the preferred embodiments, the present invention relates to<br>
formation of vinyl benzoate (VB), vinyl 2-ethyl hexanoate (V2EH), and vinyl<br>
esters of various other neo carboxylic acids using heterogeneous catalysts.<br>
Background<br>
There is a long felt need for an economically viable process for the<br>
formation of vinyl carboxylates such as, for example, vinyl benzoate. Vinyl<br>
carboxylates, such as for example vinyl benzoate, find use in a variety of<br>
applications including, for example, paints, adhesives and various other coating<br>
formulations as well as cement mortar admixtures.<br>
It is known in the art that vinyl carboxylates can be formed from the<br>
reaction of a carboxylic acid with acetylene. A variety of catalysts have been<br>
proposed including base metals such as zinc, cadmium and mercury as well as<br>
precious metal catalysts such as rhenium, ruthenium, palladium, etc. In fact, the<br>
 <br>
zinc carboxylate catalyzed process has been commercialized by Hexion Specialty<br>
Chemicals for the production of VEOVA™ Monomer 10, which is a vinyl ester of<br>
VERSAT1C™ Acid 10, a synthetic saturated monocarboxylic acid of highly<br>
branched structure containing ten carbon atoms. More particularly, see United<br>
States Patent No. 6,891,052 to Tanner et al, wherein is disclosed a zinc<br>
carboxylate catalyst, which is used for the formation of vinyl ester from the<br>
reaction of carboxylic acid with acetylene.<br>
Similarly, various other processes have been reported in the literature<br>
wherein a carboxylic acid is reacted with acetylene to form the corresponding<br>
vinyl ester. See United States Patent No. 3,607,915 to Borsboom et al. and<br>
Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Addition of Heteroatom-Hydrogen Bonds to Alkynes,<br>
Alonso et al, Chem. Rev., 2004, 104 (6), 3079-3160. In particular, Borsboom et<br>
al. disclose generally another method involving zinc-catalyzed carboxylic acid<br>
reaction with acetylene, as already noted above. Whereas, Alonso et al. provide<br>
an analysis of the state of the art for catalytic addition chemistry of the reaction of<br>
acetylene with a carboxylic acid. See also, United States Patent No. 2,066,075 to<br>
Reppe, German Patent No. DE 740678 to I.G. Farbenindustrie AG, United States<br>
Patent Nos. 2,339,066 and 2,342,463 to Fischer et al, British Patent No. GB<br>
641,438 A to General Aniline and Film Corporation, United States Patent No.<br>
2,472,086 to Belter et al, Swiss Patent No. CH 324667 to Staeger Reinhard,<br>
United States Patent No. 3,062,863 to Fernholz et al., United States Patent No.<br>
3,125,593 to Hargrove et al, United States Patent No. 3,285,941 to Engel et al,<br>
German Patent No. DE 1237557 to Shell Internationale Research, United States<br>
Patent No. 3,646,077 to Hiibner et al, and United States Patent No. 6,500,979 to<br>
Wiese et al.<br>
It has also been reported in the literature that a variety of Group VIII metal<br>
complex catalysts are effective in the formation of vinyl esters by the reaction of<br>
carboxylic acids with acetylene. See, for example, United States Patent No.<br>
3,479,392 to Stern et al and United States Patent No. 5,395,960 to Heider el al<br>
 <br>
Both Stern et al. and Heider et al. disclose vinylation of aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
in the presence of a catalyst based on ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium,<br>
iridium, or platinum. Stem et al. is specifically drawn to a process for producing<br>
substituted olefins from a reactant other than acetylene or acetylenic compounds,<br>
and Heider et al. only disclose branched aliphatic carboxylic acids suitable for the<br>
catalyzed vinylation reaction, providing examples including 2-ethylhexanoic acid,<br>
4-tert-butylbenzoic acid, suberic acid, and monomethyl succinate. However,<br>
Heider et al. disclose use of only ruthenium metal as a catalyst by way of<br>
examples and employ a very low molar ratio of carboxylic acid to ruthenium of<br>
about 25 to 100. That is, Heider et al. conditions require a large amount of<br>
catalyst per mole of vinyl ester produced. Additionally, Heider et al. employ<br>
longer reaction times of 7 to 17 hours rendering these conditions unsuitable for an<br>
industrial operation.<br>
Palladium used as a co-catalyst with a cadmium or zinc catalyst is also<br>
known in the vinylation art. See, for example, German Patent No. DE 1161878 to<br>
Farbwerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft and British Patent No. GB 1,130,245 to<br>
Shell Internationale Research. Both patents disclose vinylation of benzoic acid<br>
and acetylene in the presence of a zinc or cadmium catalyst and a palladium co-<br>
catalyst. The palladium compounds taught are, however, free palladium metal or<br>
palladium chloride, and the processes are typically operated at temperatures above<br>
120°C.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,430,179 to Lincoln et al. describes a<br>
homogeneous process for vinyl ester synthesis, such as vinyl benzoate, by<br>
ruthenium-catalyzed addition of carboxylic acids, including benzoic acid, to<br>
alkynes, including acetylene. Lincoln et al. disclose reaction conditions that<br>
include an optional solvent, such as toluene or mineral oil, and a temperature<br>
range of from about 40 to about 200°C. Lincoln et al. further disclose use of a<br>
ruthenium catalyst selected from a group that includes ruthenium dodecacarbonyl<br>
in concentrations ranging from about 50,000 ppm to about 0.5 ppm ruthenium<br>
 <br>
based on the weight of the liquid phase reaction medium optionally in<br>
combination with a ligand such as triphenyl phosphine, tris(methoxyphenyl)-<br>
phosphine, or tris(p-fluoromethylphenyl)phosphine. However, Lincoln el al.,<br>
disclose only one example of forming vinyl pivalate from the reaction of pivalic<br>
acid with acetylene under the reaction conditions disclosed therein.<br>
WO 2007/060176 Al to BASF Aktiengesellschaft provides a process for<br>
preparing vinyl carboxylates by reacting a carboxylic acid with an alkyne<br>
compound in the presence of a catalyst selected from a group of metal compounds<br>
including rhenium-based compounds. BASF specifically discloses reacting<br>
benzoic acid and acetylene in the presence of dirheniumdecacarbonyl; see<br>
Example 1. The Example teaches a molar ratio of carboxyl group to rhenium<br>
atom of 388, wherein the reaction takes place in a toluene solvent at 140°C over a<br>
reaction time of 6 hours. The reported yield is 99%.<br>
However, it has now been found that none of the existing processes is<br>
suitable for the production of vinyl benzoate (VB) or vinyl 2-ethyl hexanoate<br>
(V2EH) via the vinylation reaction, particularly, under heterogeneous catalytic<br>
conditions. Moreover, the conventional zinc catalysts provided unacceptable<br>
reaction rates and yields for an industrial scale-up operation. In addition, there are<br>
no heterogeneous catalytic processes that are readily employable for an industrial<br>
scale continuous, semi-continuous or batch operation for the production of vinyl<br>
esters such as VB or V2EH. Thus it is desirable to develop economically viable<br>
catalytically active reactions to form VB or V2EH from their respective<br>
carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions involving heterogeneous<br>
supported metal catalysts.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been unexpectedly found that vinyl benzoate can be made on an<br>
industrial scale from the reaction of a carboxylic acid, such as benzoic acid with<br>
acetylene with high selectivity and yield. More particularly, this invention<br>
 <br>
provides a heterogeneous process for the selective formation of vinyl esters from<br>
their corresponding carboxylic acids and acetylene, which comprises reacting a<br>
carboxylic acid, optionally dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, with acetylene<br>
in the presence of a supported metal catalyst at a suitable reaction temperature and<br>
pressure, and optionally in the presence of one or more ligands or additives or a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
The catalyst employed in the process of this invention is a supported metal<br>
catalyst. Examples of supported metals that are suitable in the process of this<br>
invention include without any limitation iridium, palladium, platinum, rhenium,<br>
rhodium and ruthenium.<br>
Any of the known catalyst supports can be employed to support the metals<br>
of the process of this invention. Representative catalyst supports include without<br>
any limitation, carbon, graphite, silica, titania, alumina, calcium silicate, calcium<br>
carbonate, silica-alumina, silica aluminate, zirconia, barium carbonate, barium<br>
sulfate, and the like.<br>
It has now been found that use of certain ligands and additives enhance the<br>
catalytic activity of certain catalysts of this invention, which aspect is described in<br>
detail hereinbelow. However, it should also be noted that other combinations of<br>
certain catalysts of this invention in the presence of certain ligands and additives<br>
exhibit diminished activity, which again becomes apparent from the detailed<br>
description that follows. Various ligands and additives that can bring about the<br>
vinylation reaction with a carboxylic acid and acetylene can be employed in the<br>
process of this invention.<br>
It has also been found that by suitable selection of the catalyst and<br>
optionally the ligand(s) and additive(s) and utilizing them in suitable amounts<br>
results in at least 50 percent (%) conversion of a carboxylic acid and the<br>
selectivity to vinyl ester can be at least 50 percent (%). In addition, by suitable<br>
 <br>
practice of this invention it is possible to attain a Relative Activity of at least 80<br>
and up to about 2000.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described in the<br>
detailed description below and in the claims.<br>

 Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is described in detail below with reference to several<br>
embodiments and numerous examples. Terminology used herein is given its<br>
ordinary meaning consistent with the exemplary definitions set forth immediately<br>
below.<br>
<br>
 <br>
As used herein, a heterogeneous catalyst refers to a catalyst that is in a<br>
different phase than the reactants during catalysis. In order for the reaction to<br>
occur, one or more of the reactants must diffuse to the catalyst surface and adsorb<br>
onto it. After reaction, the products must desorb and diffuse away from the<br>
surface. In contrast, as used herein a homogeneous catalyst refers to a catalyst that<br>
is present in the same phase as the reactants.<br>
Mole percent (mole %) and like terms refer to mole percent unless<br>
otherwise indicated. Weight percent (wt % or %) and like terms refer to weight<br>
percent unless otherwise indicated.<br>
"Conversion" refers to the fraction of reactant consumed in the reaction<br>
and is expressed as a mass percentage based on the amount of carboxylic acid in<br>
the feed. The conversion of carboxylic acid (CA) is calculated from gas<br>
chromatography (GC) data using the following equation:<br>
 <br>
where mass CA, in = mass of carboxylic acid loaded (weighed in) into the reactor,<br>
and mass CA, out (GC) = mass of carboxylic acid after the reaction based on GC<br>
data.<br>
"Selectivity" refers to the amount of vinyl ester produced relative to the<br>
carboxylic acid consumed and is expressed as a mole percent based on converted<br>
carboxylic acid. For example, if the conversion is 50 mole % and 50 mole % of<br>
the converted carboxylic acid is converted to vinyl ester, we refer to the vinyl<br>
 <br>
ester selectivity as 50%. Selectivity to vinyl ester (VE) is calculated from gas<br>
chromatography (GC) data using the following equation:<br>
 <br>
"Yield" refers to the amount of vinyl ester produced relative to the<br>
carboxylic acid loaded into the reactor and is expressed as a mole percent based<br>
on carboxylic acid loaded into the reactor. Yield of vinyl ester (VE) is calculated<br>
from gas chromatography (GC) data using the following equation:<br>
 <br>
where mol CA, in = number of moles of carboxylic acid loaded (weighed in) into<br>
the reactor, mol CA, out (GC) = number of moles of carboxylic acid after the<br>
reaction based on GC data, and mol VE, out (GC) = number of moles of vinyl<br>
ester after the reaction based on GC data.<br>
The catalyst activity is determined by Turnover Number (TON) using the<br>
following equation. TON refers to the average amount of desired product<br>
produced by each metal atom contained in the catalyst.<br>
 <br>
where mol Cat = number of moles of catalysts loaded (weighed in) into the<br>
reactor, and N Metal atoms = moles of metal atoms in one mole of catalyst.'<br>
 <br>
For example, a Turnover Number calculated for platinum at a 5 wt %<br>
loading on carbon used in the production of vinyl benzoate is determined by<br>
computing as the numerator: the grams of vinyl benzoate per run divided by the<br>
molecular weight of vinyl benzoate, 148.15 gm/mol; and computing as the<br>
denominator: the loading value, 0.05 times 1 gram of platinum, divided by the<br>
molecular weight of platinum, 195.084 gm/mol.<br>
For Turnover Numbers determined under the following conditions, the<br>
Turnover Number is referred to herein as Relative Activity. The conditions for<br>
determining Relative Activity of the catalyst or system include a batch run<br>
duration of 4 hours, a charged molar ratio of carboxylic acid to catalyst metal of<br>
about 385:1, and a temperature of 120°C. When a ligand is used, the ligand is<br>
available in a molar ratio of ligand to catalyst metal of 1:1.<br>
 <br>
where R is an alkyl group, including a primary, a secondary or a tertiary alkyl<br>
group; a cycloalkyl group; or an aryl group such as phenyl. Thus, when R is<br>
phenyl, the acid employed is benzoic acid (BA) and the product formed is vinyl<br>
benzoate (VB) in accordance with the following chemical equation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
It has now been unexpectedly found that a vinyl ester can be made on an<br>
industrial scale from the reaction of a corresponding carboxylic acid with<br>
acetylene with high selectivity and yield. More particularly, this invention<br>
provides a heterogeneous process for the selective formation of a vinyl ester from<br>
its corresponding carboxylic acid and acetylene, which comprises reacting a<br>
carboxylic acid optionally dissolved in a suitable organic solvent with acetylene in<br>
the presence of a supported metal catalyst at a suitable reaction temperature and<br>
pressure, and optionally in the presence of one or more ligands or additives or a<br>
mixture thereof. Such solvents may include, for example, acetonitrile, butyl<br>
benzoate, diethyleneglycoldibutylether, mesitylene, mineral oil, and toluene.<br>
 <br>
acid. In general, the greater the molecular weight of the alkyl groups on the<br>
alpha-carbon, the greater the steric effect and the less reactive the neo acid. The<br>
neo acids that are suitable in this invention may be expressed according to formula<br>
I:<br>
 <br>
where each of R1, R2 and R3 is an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbons and the<br>
total carbons in R1+R2+R3 is from 3 to 30. Examples of neo acids include without<br>
any limitation neopentanoic acid, neoheptanoic acid, neodecanoic acid, etc.<br>
Several of the neo acids are commercially available, for example from<br>
ExxonMobil Chemical Company. Specific examples of commercially available<br>
neo acids include the ones listed above and proprietary neo acids such as neo 910<br>
and neo 913 from ExxonMobil Chemical Company.<br>
Although the process of this invention is intended to make vinyl ester from<br>
the reaction of acetylene with a carboxylic acid, various other known primary<br>
alkynes that can bring about such a vinylation reaction can also be employed in<br>
the process of this invention. Generally, unsubstituted alkynes and mono-<br>
substituted alkynes that do not interfere with the addition reaction of the process<br>
of this invention may be used. Representative substituents include alkyl, alkoxy,<br>
aryl, aryloxy, acetoxy, carboxyl and halo groups. Alkynes typically have from 2<br>
to 10 carbon atoms and suitable alkynes include substituted or unsubstituted<br>
primary alkynes such as acetylene, methyl acetylene, phenyl acetylene, 1-butyne,<br>
1-pentyne, 1-hexyne, 1-heptyne, 1-octyne, 1-nonyne, I-decyne, and the like.<br>
More suitable alkynes useful in the practice of the invention include acetylene and<br>
methyl acetylene.<br>
 <br>
The catalyst employed in the process of this invention is a supported metal<br>
catalyst. Examples of supported metals that are suitable in this process of the<br>
invention include without any limitation iridium, palladium, platinum, rhenium,<br>
rhodium and ruthenium.<br>
Any of the known catalyst supports can be employed to support the metals<br>
of the process of this invention. Representative catalyst supports include without<br>
any limitation, carbon, activated carbon, graphite, silica, titania, alumina, calcium<br>
silicate, calcium carbonate, silica-alumina, silica aluminate, zirconia, barium<br>
carbonate, barium sulfate, and the like.<br>
The process according to the invention may be practiced using any<br>
conventional reactor known in the art, under batch, semi-batch, or continuous<br>
conditions. The reactor may employ a fixed bed, a fluidized bed, or a moving bed.<br>
For example, a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) with acetylene sparging<br>
system, mild mechanical agitation and candle filter filtration (to hold the catalyst<br>
particles inside the reactor) can be a commercial option. Alternatively a trickle-<br>
bed, where the carboxylic acid and the acetylene are introduced co-currently from<br>
the top may be used. Another fixed bed reactor type is the bubble column where<br>
acetylene comes in from the bottom, catalyst is deposited inside the reactor tower<br>
and liquid carboxylic acid is introduced from the top. These examples are not<br>
meant to be limiting. A modern reactive distillation system where each tray is<br>
coated with catalyst can also be used, for instance.<br>
One of skill in the art would likely select a reactor size necessary to<br>
optimize reactor throughput by whatever variable is appropriate, for instance<br>
reactor productivity (STY) or conversion. The size and shape of heterogeneous<br>
catalyst particles selected are dependent upon the type of reactor used. Thus, the<br>
catalyst may be in the form of pellets, powder, saddles, spheres, etc.<br>
 <br>
In accordance with the invention, reaction of a carboxylic acid with<br>
acetylene can be carried out in a variety of configurations such as those discussed<br>
above, including a batch reactor involving a single reaction zone and a continuous<br>
reactor wherein the reactant feed is passed through a fixed bed or a fluidized<br>
catalyst bed. The process of this invention can also be carried out using any of the<br>
other known techniques in the art such as a semi-continuous process using a<br>
stirred tank reactor, etc. For example, in a single reaction zone the catalyst may<br>
be a layered fixed bed, if so desired. An adiabatic reactor could be used, or a shell<br>
and tube reactor provided with a heat transfer medium could be used. The fixed<br>
bed can comprise a mixture of different catalyst particles which include multiple<br>
catalysts, ligands and additives as further described herein. The fixed bed may<br>
also include a layer of particulate material making up a mixing zone for the<br>
reactants. A reaction mixture including a solution of carboxylic acid, if so<br>
desired, acetylene and optionally an inert carrier gas is fed to the bed as a stream<br>
under pressure to the mixing zone. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid itself can be<br>
fed with acetylene optionally with an inert carrier gas, such as nitrogen. The<br>
stream is subsequently supplied (by way of pressure drop) to the reaction zone or<br>
layer. The reaction zone comprises a catalytic composition including a suitable<br>
supported metal catalyst where a carboxylic acid such as benzoic acid is reacted<br>
with acetylene. Any suitable particle size may be used depending upon the type<br>
of reactor, throughput requirements and so forth.<br>
Although various metal loading levels on the supported catalysts known to<br>
one skilled in the art can be employed in the process of this invention it is<br>
preferred that a supported metal catalyst employed contains about 0.1 weight<br>
percent to about 20 weight percent of metal on a suitable catalyst support. As<br>
described further below it may also be advantageous that the supported metal<br>
catalysts that are suitable in the process of this invention may optionally contain a<br>
ligand and/or other additives including a second and/or a third supported metal on<br>
the same catalyst support. The following metals may be mentioned as those<br>
metals suitable as a second and/or third metal without any limitation: palladium,<br>
 <br>
cadmium, zinc and a mixture thereof. Typically, it is preferred that only the<br>
supported metal catalyst as described herein may be used in the process of this<br>
invention. However, other ligands and/or additives may be added to the reaction<br>
feed as additional catalytic enhancers or promoters.<br>
As noted above, various catalyst supports known in the art can be used to<br>
support the catalysts of this invention. Preferred supports are carbon, activated<br>
carbon, graphite, calcium carbonate, titania, alumina, alumina-silica, and barium<br>
sulfate. More preferably, carbon, activated carbon, alumina, titania or zirconia are<br>
used as supports. It should be noted that various supported metal catalysts which<br>
are suitable in this invention are commercially available and may be used with or<br>
without catalyst activation.<br>
In an embodiment of this invention the preferred catalyst support is<br>
carbon. Various forms of carbon known in the art that are suitable as catalyst<br>
support can be used in the process of this invention. Carbon supports that are<br>
suitable in this invention include non-activated as well as activated forms.<br>
Activation of carbon support can be performed using any of the methods known in<br>
the art. See for example, United States Patent No. 5,064,801, wherein a process<br>
for activating a certain carbon catalyst is disclosed. Another type of carbon<br>
support is a graphitized carbon, particularly the high surface area graphitized<br>
carbon as described in Great Britain Patent No. 2,136,704. The carbon is<br>
preferably in particulate form, for example, as pellets. The size of the carbon<br>
particles will depend on the pressure drop acceptable in any given reactor (which<br>
gives a minimum pellet size) and reactant diffusion constraint within the pellet<br>
(which gives a maximum pellet size).<br>
The carbon catalyst supports that are suitable in the process of this<br>
invention preferably are porous carbon catalyst supports. With the preferred<br>
particle sizes the carbon will need to be porous to meet the preferred surface area<br>
characteristics.<br>
 <br>
The catalyst supports including the carbon catalyst supports may be<br>
characterized by their BET, basal plane, and edge surface areas. The BET surface<br>
area is the surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption using the method of<br>
Brunauer Emmett and Teller J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60,309 (1938). The basal plane<br>
surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the<br>
carbon of n-dotriacontane from n-heptane by the method described in Proc. Roy.<br>
Soc. A314 pages 473-498, with particular reference to page 489. The edge<br>
surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the<br>
carbon of n-butanol from n-heptane as disclosed in the Proc. Roy. Soc. article<br>
mentioned above with particular reference to page 495.<br>
The preferred carbon catalyst supports for use in the present invention<br>
have a BET surface area of at least 100 m2/g, more preferably at least 200 m2/ g,<br>
most preferably at least 300 m2 /g. The BET surface area is preferably not greater<br>
than 1000 m2/g, more preferably not greater than 750 m2/g.<br>
The preferred carbon support may be prepared by heat treating a carbon-<br>
containing starting material. The starting material may be an oleophilic graphite,<br>
e.g. prepared as disclosed in Great Britain Patent No. 1,168,785, or may be a<br>
carbon black.<br>
As noted above, the loading levels of metal on the catalyst support is<br>
generally in the range of about 0.1 weight percent to about 20 weight percent. As<br>
already noted above, the amount of a second or third component loaded on a<br>
support is not very critical in this invention and can vary in the range of about 0.1<br>
weight percent to about 10 weight percent. Preferably, the supported metal<br>
catalyst of this invention is free of any other loading. A metal loading of about<br>
0.3 weight percent to about 6 weight percent based on the weight of the support is<br>
particularly preferred. Thus, for example, 0.5 to 10 weight percent of platinum<br>
supported on carbon, activated carbon, graphite, alumina, zirconia or titania is<br>
 <br>
particularly a preferred catalyst. More preferably, the platinum loading level is<br>
from about 0.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent. Other supports suitable<br>
for supporting platinum metal include without any limitation the following:<br>
barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and silica.<br>
Similarly, a catalyst containing about 1 to 3 weight percent of rhenium<br>
supported on carbon is also a preferred catalyst. Other suitable catalysts include a<br>
catalyst containing about 1 to 6 weight percent of rhodium supported on carbon, a<br>
catalyst containing about 1 to 3 weight percent of ruthenium supported on silica, a<br>
catalyst containing about 1 to 6 weight percent of palladium supported on carbon,<br>
a catalyst containing about 1 to 6 weight percent of palladium supported on<br>
carbon, which may also contain about 1 to 4 weight percent of platinum as a<br>
second metal, a catalyst containing about 1 to 6 weight percent of iridium<br>
supported on carbon, a catalyst containing about 1 to 6 weight percent of iridium<br>
supported on calcium carbonate and iridium (IV) oxide itself as a supported metal<br>
catalyst.<br>
As already noted above, many of the supported metal catalysts useful in<br>
this invention are commercially available. However, the supported metal catalysts<br>
can also be readily prepared using any of the methods known in the art, such as<br>
for example by metal impregnation techniques. The metal impregnation can be<br>
carried out using any of the known methods in the art. Typically, before<br>
impregnation the supports are dried at 120°C and shaped to particles having size<br>
distribution in the range of about 0.2 to 0.4 mm. Optionally, the supports may be<br>
pressed, crushed and sieved to a desired size distribution. Any of the known<br>
methods to shape the support materials into desired size distribution can be<br>
employed.<br>
For supports having low surface area, such as for example alpha-alumina,<br>
the metal solutions are added in excess until complete wetness or excess liquid<br>
impregnation so as to obtain desirable metal loadings.<br>
 <br>
As noted above, the supported metal catalysts used in the process of this<br>
invention may be bimetallic catalysts: The bimetallic catalysts are generally<br>
impregnated in two steps. First, the second metal is added, followed by the<br>
"main" metal. Each impregnation step is followed by drying and calcination. The<br>
bimetallic catalysts may also be prepared by co-impregnation. In the case of<br>
trimetallic containing catalysts, a sequential impregnation may be used, starting<br>
with the addition of the secondary or tertiary metal. The second impregnation step<br>
may involve co-impregnation of the two principal metals. For example, Pd/Pt on<br>
carbon may be prepared by a first impregnation of platinum nitrate, followed by<br>
the impregnation of palladium acetate. Again, each impregnation is followed by<br>
drying and calcination. In most cases, the impregnation may be carried out using<br>
metal nitrate solutions. However, various other soluble salts which upon<br>
calcination release metal ions can also be used. Examples of other suitable metal<br>
salts for impregnation include metal hydroxide, metal oxide, metal acetate,<br>
ammonium metal oxide, such as ammonium heptamolybdate hexahydrate, metal<br>
acids, such as perrhenic acid solution, metal oxalate, and the like.<br>
It has now been found that the use of certain ligands and additives enhance<br>
the catalytic activity of the supported metal catalysts of this invention. Various<br>
ligands and additives that can bring about the vinylation reaction with a carboxylic<br>
acid and acetylene can be employed in the process of this invention. Examples of<br>
ligands include without any limitation the following: triphenylphosphine, 1,2-<br>
diphenylphosphinobenzene (1,2-DPPB), o-bipyridyl, (±)-2,2'-bis(diphenyl-<br>
phosphino)-1,1 '-binaphthalene, 1,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene, 4,5-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine,<br>
oxydi-2,1 -phenylenebis(diphenylphosphine), tris(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)-<br>
phosphine [P(p-CF3C6H4)3], tris(l-naphthyl)phosphine, tris(2,4,6-<br>
trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine and tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine.<br>
 <br>
Examples of additives include aluminum acetylacetonate, aluminum<br>
chloride, cadmium acetylacetonate, cerium chloride, iron chloride, potassium<br>
acetate, lithium acetate, lithium bromide, lithium chloride, sodium benzoate,<br>
sodium phosphate, sodium tetrafluoroborate, sodium chloride, sodium iodide,<br>
sodium trifluoroacetate, potassium acetate, para-benzoquinone, palladium acetate,<br>
palladium acetylacetonate, palladium chloride, vinyl acetate, trirutheniumdo-<br>
decacarbonyl (Ru3(CO)12), zinc bromide, zinc chloride, benzoic anhydride, tri-(n-<br>
butyl)amine or tributylamine, tetra-(n-butyl)ammonium chloride, tetrabutyl-<br>
ammonium acetate, sodium phosphate and tetrabutylammonium acetate.<br>
In an aspect of this invention the process of this invention is generally<br>
carried out in a batch operation using a stirred tank reactor. The supported metal<br>
catalyst is slurried in a suitable solvent. To this slurry is added a solution of<br>
carboxylic acid and any desirable ligands and/or additives. The reactor is heated to<br>
desirable temperatures under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, and acetylene<br>
is fed into the reactor for a certain length of time. Typically, as already discussed<br>
above, the reaction times may vary depending upon the catalyst and can range<br>
from about 1 hour to 4 hours.<br>
In another aspect of this invention the reaction can also be carried out in a<br>
continuous process. In this aspect, the reactants, such as benzoic acid, suitably as<br>
a solution, and acetylene, are fed into a reactor packed with the supported metal<br>
catalyst. As noted, the carboxylic acid can be fed into the reactor as a solution<br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent or neat if it is in the liquid form, such as for<br>
example 2-ethylhexanoic acid. Inert gas such as nitrogen may be used as a carrier<br>
gas to feed both the carboxylic acid and acetylene at a desirable reaction<br>
temperature as discussed herein.<br>
Contact or residence time can also vary widely, depending upon such<br>
variables as amount of carboxylic acid and acetylene, amount and type of catalyst<br>
and reactor, temperature and pressure employed. Typical contact times range<br>
 <br>
from a fraction of a second to more than several hours when a catalyst system<br>
other than a fixed bed is used, with preferred contact times, at least for vapor<br>
phase reactions, between about 0.5 and 100 seconds.<br>
Typically, in this aspect of the invention, the catalyst employed is in a<br>
fixed bed reactor, e.g. in the shape of an elongated pipe or tube, where the<br>
reactants, typically in vapor form or as a solution, are passed over or through the<br>
catalyst. Other reactors, such as fluid or ebullient bed reactors, can be employed,<br>
if desired. In some instances, it is advantageous to use the supported metal<br>
catalysts in conjunction with an inert material to regulate the pressure drop, flow,<br>
heat balance or other process parameters in the catalyst bed including the contact<br>
time of the reactant compounds with the catalyst particles.<br>
As apparent from the Examples that follow, by practice of this invention it<br>
is possible to obtain high conversion and selectivity to vinyl esters. That is, by<br>
suitable selection of the catalyst and optionally the ligand(s) and additive(s) it has<br>
now been found that high conversion of carboxylic acid to vinyl ester, for example<br>
benzoic acid to vinyl benzoate, can be achieved. More particularly, it has been<br>
observed that utilization of a desirable amount of catalyst in combination with<br>
optional ligand(s) and additive(s) results in at least 50 percent (%) conversion of<br>
carboxylic acid. Additionally, the selectivity to vinyl ester is found to be at least<br>
50 percent (%). Furthermore, by suitable practice of this invention it is possible to<br>
attain a Relative Activity of at least 80 and up to about 2000.<br>
The process of this reaction can be carried out using any reaction<br>
temperature such that the intended reaction of a carboxylic acid with acetylene to<br>
form a vinyl ester can take place resulting in high selectivity to vinyl ester and at<br>
high conversions of carboxylic acid. Typically, such reactions in a batch<br>
operation are carried out at a temperature range from about 100°C to about 180°C.<br>
For example, the reaction temperature can range from about 110°C to about 170°C<br>
under certain catalytic conditions. The reaction temperature can also range from<br>
 <br>
about 120°C to about 160°C under certain other catalytic conditions. In some<br>
cases the reaction temperature ranges from about 130°C to about 150°C. In certain<br>
other situations the reaction temperature ranges from about 135°C to about 145°C.<br>
However, in a continuous operation such as the one described above even higher<br>
reaction temperatures may be employed.<br>
The reaction can also be carried out at any pressure condition so as to<br>
selectively form vinyl ester from carboxylic acid at high conversions, such as for<br>
example sub-atmospheric, atmospheric or super-atmospheric conditions.<br>
Generally, it is preferred that the reaction is carried out at a pressure in the range<br>
of from about one atmosphere to two atmospheres absolute. More particularly,<br>
the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure conditions in an inert<br>
atmosphere, such as for example in an atmosphere of nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
In general, the amount of acetylenic compound employed is equimolar or<br>
slightly in excess of equimolar to the carboxylic group to be converted. Thus,<br>
when the carboxylic acid used is a mono-carboxylic acid, a molar ratio of<br>
acetylene to acid is generally from about 1:1 to 100:1, preferably from about 1.2:1<br>
to 30:1, and more preferably from about 1.5:1 to about 10:1. Accordingly,<br>
acetylenic compound is proportionately used in higher quantities when dibasic<br>
and/or other polybasic acids are employed.<br>
In an aspect of this invention, the process of this invention can be carried<br>
out with a small amount of the catalyst. That is, large amounts of carboxylic acids<br>
such as benzoic acid (BA) can be converted to a vinyl ester such as vinyl benzoate<br>
(VB) in the presence of small amounts of catalyst material. Generally, the<br>
reaction mixture comprises a mixture of desired supported metal catalyst and<br>
carboxylic acid in a molar carboxylic acid (CA) to metal ratio of from about<br>
4000:1 to about 100:1. More typically, the molar CA/metal ratio is about 1000:1.<br>
However any other molar CA/metal ratio that would bring about the desired<br>
 <br>
conversion and selectivity to vinyl ester such as VB can be employed in the<br>
process of this invention.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the catalyst exhibits a very high<br>
Relative Activity (moles of vinyl ester/metal atom) in the process of this<br>
invention. Typically, the Relative Activities range from about 80 to about 2000,<br>
preferably Relative Activities range from about 100 to about 1500, more<br>
preferably from about 100 to about 1000.<br>
In a further aspect of this invention, very high selectivity to vinyl ester,<br>
such as for example vinyl benzoate, can be obtained by suitable practice of the<br>
process of this invention. Typically, the selectivity to vinyl ester based on<br>
carboxylic acid consumed can at least be 60 percent. More specifically, the<br>
selectivity to vinyl ester based on carboxylic acid consumed may be at least 80<br>
percent. Even more specifically, the selectivity to vinyl ester based on carboxylic<br>
acid consumed is at least 99 percent.<br>
As already discussed above, depending upon the configuration of the<br>
supported metal catalyst system and the type of reactor, the process of this<br>
invention can be carried out to a desirable length of time in order to obtain the best<br>
catalyst activity, Relative Activities and selectivity to vinyl ester, such as VB or<br>
V2EH. Typically, the reactions are run in a batch mode for a period ranging from<br>
about 1 hour to about 5 hours. More typically, the reaction is carried out in the<br>
batch mode for a period of about four hours. However, the process of this<br>
invention can be carried out in a semi-continuous or continuous manner using any<br>
of the known process techniques in the art.<br>
Thus in one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a supported<br>
metal catalyst wherein the metal is platinum and the catalyst support is carbon,<br>
activated carbon, graphite, titania, alumina, zirconia, alumina-silica, barium<br>
sulfate and calcium carbonate. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of<br>
 <br>
platinum is from about 0.5 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, preferably<br>
from about 0.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent. In this aspect of the<br>
invention it has now been found that the use of certain ligands as described herein<br>
may enhance the catalytic activity of the platinum as observed by increase in<br>
either selectivity to vinyl ester, such as VB or conversion of carboxylic acid, such<br>
as BA or both. It has been observed that ligands such as 1,2-DPPB or<br>
triphenylphosphine generally exhibit positive or negative effects on the catalytic<br>
activity of platinum depending upon the temperature of the reaction as further<br>
discussed below. Similarly, it has also been observed that addition of certain<br>
additives may also have positive effect on supported platinum catalysts.<br>
Examples of such additives include sodium benzoate, benzoic anhydride,<br>
tetrabutylammonium acetate, tributylamine, and the like. In general, the additives<br>
increase the rate of conversion of carboxylic acid, such as BA.<br>
In general, it has now been found that alumina, carbon, activated carbon,<br>
zirconia and titania are the preferred catalyst supports for platinum. The<br>
following supported platinum catalysts are particularly preferred:<br>
0.5% platinum supported on carbon;<br>
1% platinum supported on carbon;<br>
3% platinum supported on activated carbon;<br>
5% platinum supported on activated carbon;<br>
0.5% platinum supported on alumina;<br>
5% platinum supported on alumina;<br>
0.9% platinum supported on zirconia; and<br>
5% platinum supported on titania.<br>
All of the above listed supported platinum catalysts are commercially<br>
available and/or can be prepared in accordance with any of the literature<br>
procedures known to one skilled in the art.<br>
 <br>
Typically, the activity of the supported platinum metal catalyst increases<br>
with increasing temperature from about 120°C to about 170°C. The Relative<br>
Activities typically increase with increasing temperature and maximum Relative<br>
Activities are typically observed at around 160°C under batch mode operation.<br>
However, even higher Relative Activities may be observed in a continuous<br>
operation using a fixed bed reactor at even higher temperatures. As already noted<br>
above, use of certain ligands may have a positive or negative effect on the<br>
conversion or the selectivity especially at varied reaction temperatures. It has now<br>
been observed that the use of ligands such as triphenylphosphine or 1,2-DPPB<br>
exhibit different effects on the supported platinum catalyst with varied reaction<br>
temperatures. Although both ligands generally lowered activities for supported<br>
platinum metal catalysts, Relative Activity and conversion values increase with<br>
increasing temperature in the presence of triphenylphosphine, whereas the values<br>
are evenly suppressed across temperatures in the presence of 1,2-DPPB.<br>
For most supported platinum catalysts, increasing temperature generally<br>
results in an increase in the conversion of carboxylic acid, such as benzoic acid,<br>
and a decrease in the selectivity to vinyl ester, such as vinyl benzoate. However,<br>
as noted above, the temperature of about 160°C is preferred to obtain optimal<br>
conversion and selectivity to vinyl benzoate in a batch mode.<br>
Typically, the reaction time used in supported platinum catalysts is from<br>
about one hour to about four hours. Preferably, the reaction time is about two to<br>
about four hours.<br>
In general, the Relative Activities increase with higher molar carboxylic<br>
acid (CA)/metal ratio. For example, the molar CA/metal ratio can range from<br>
about 300 to 4000, more preferably from about 380 to about 3000, and even more<br>
preferably from about 1200 to about 2500. Relative Activities of up to 600 or<br>
higher can be achieved with 0.5% platinum supported on alumina, 0.9% platinum<br>
supported on zirconia, or 0.5% to 1% platinum supported on carbon. More<br>
 <br>
particularly, it has now been observed that at a molar BA to platinum atom ratio of<br>
about 1450, Relative Activities of about 700 can be achieved and at a molar BA to<br>
platinum atom ratio of about 2300, Relative Activities of about 700 to 800 can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Generally, the type of catalyst support employed has an effect on the<br>
conversion and selectivity to vinyl ester. It has now been observed that carbon,<br>
zirconia or titania exhibit higher Relative Activities. Titania exhibits highest<br>
conversion whereas carbon exhibits highest selectivity.<br>
In general, the supported platinum catalysts are dried in nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at 100°C for 16 hours before use. The tested catalysts may be reused<br>
after drying again at 100°C for 16 hours. The catalysts may also be dried at a<br>
temperature range of 50°C to 100°C in air for a sufficient length of time, such as<br>
for example about 16 hours. However, it is preferred that the supported platinum<br>
catalysts are dried in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a<br>
supported metal catalyst wherein the metal is rhenium and the catalyst support is<br>
carbon. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of rhenium is from one (1)<br>
weight percent to about six (6) weight percent, preferably the loading of rhenium<br>
is from about two (2) weight percent to about four (4) weight percent. Again in<br>
this aspect of the invention, certain of the ligands and/or additives can be used in<br>
combination with a supported rhenium catalyst. A specific example of a<br>
supported rhenium catalyst is two (2) weight percent rhenium on carbon, which is<br>
commercially available.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a<br>
supported metal catalyst wherein the metal is rhodium and the catalyst support is<br>
carbon. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of rhodium is from one (1)<br>
weight percent to about ten (10) weight percent, preferably from about two (2)<br>
 <br>
weight percent to about six (6) weight percent. Again in this aspect of the<br>
invention, certain ligands and/or additives can be used in combination with a<br>
supported rhodium catalyst. A specific example of a supported rhodium catalyst<br>
is five (5) weight percent rhodium on carbon, which is commercially available.<br>
It has now been observed that use of triphenylphosphine with 5 weight<br>
percent rhodium on carbon has a positive effect on the conversion and selectivity<br>
to vinyl esters such as VB.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a<br>
supported metal catalyst wherein the metal is ruthenium and the catalyst support is<br>
silica. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of ruthenium is from one (I)<br>
weight percent to about ten (10) weight percent, preferably from about two (2)<br>
weight percent to about six (6) weight percent. Again in this aspect of the<br>
invention, certain ligands and/or additives can be used in combination with a<br>
supported ruthenium catalyst. A specific example of a supported ruthenium<br>
catalyst is 1.85 weight percent ruthenium on silica, which is commercially<br>
available.<br>
It has now been observed that use of a ligand such as triphenylphosphine<br>
has a positive effect on the activity of the ruthenium supported on silica. The<br>
reaction temperature that can be employed with a supported ruthenium catalyst is<br>
generally from about 150CC to about 170°C in a batch operation for the conversion<br>
of carboxylic acid to vinyl ester, such as BA to VB. Any of the solvents as<br>
described herein can be employed with ruthenium catalysts, if so desired. An<br>
example of a suitable solvent is butyl benzoate.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a<br>
supported metal catalyst wherein the metal is palladium and the catalyst support is<br>
carbon. This catalyst further contains a second metal which is platinum. In this<br>
aspect of the invention, the loading of palladium is from one (I) weight percent to<br>
 <br>
about ten (10) weight percent, preferably from about one (2) weight percent to<br>
about six (6) weight percent. Again in this aspect of the invention, certain ligands<br>
and/or additives can be used in combination with a supported palladium catalyst.<br>
A specific example of a supported palladium catalyst is three (3) weight percent<br>
palladium on carbon, which further contains platinum. This catalyst is<br>
commercially available.<br>
The reaction temperature that can be employed with a supported palladium<br>
catalyst is generally from about 150°C to about 170°C in a batch operation for the<br>
conversion of carboxylic acid to vinyl ester, such as for example BA to VB.<br>
Again, any of the solvents as described herein can be employed with palladium<br>
catalysts, if so desired. An example of a suitable solvent is butyl benzoate.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a<br>
supported metal catalyst wherein the metal is iridium and the catalyst support is<br>
either carbon or calcium carbonate. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of<br>
iridium is from one (1) weight percent to about ten (10) weight percent, preferably<br>
from about one (2) weight percent to about six (6) weight percent. Again in this<br>
aspect of the invention, certain ligands and/or additives can be used in<br>
combination with a supported iridium catalyst. Specific examples of supported<br>
iridium catalysts are: five (5) weight percent iridium on carbon or five (5) weight<br>
percent iridium on calcium carbonate, both of which are commercially available.<br>
In addition, iridium(IV) oxide can be used as such in the process of this invention<br>
as a heterogeneous supported iridium metal catalyst.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a laboratory scale system 10 for the production of<br>
vinyl esters by the reaction of a carboxylic acid and acetylene using the catalyst<br>
system of this invention. The system 10 of Figure 1 comprises a stirred reactor 20<br>
and a collector 30. The reactor 20 and the collector 30 are each provided with a<br>
condenser 40,50 for which a conventional means of pressure regulation is<br>
provided, such as a bubbler, not shown. Briefly, a suitable reactor 20 of desired<br>
 <br>
size, such as a 250 mL three-neck glass flask, is employed. The reactor 20 is<br>
initially charged with a desired carboxylic acid, suitable solvent and<br>
predetermined amounts of catalyst, and if necessary, ligands and additives. Then<br>
the reactor 20 is purged with nitrogen and heated to desired reaction temperature.<br>
Acetylene is then bubbled into the reaction mixture at a desired rate via line 24<br>
and additional carboxylic acid may be charged, with solvent as necessary, via line<br>
22. As the reaction proceeds, the vinyl ester product is removed via line 26 and is<br>
fractionated and collected in a collection flask 30. The condensers 40,50 serve to<br>
recover an optimal amount of product and solvent while releasing non-<br>
condensible gases. The temperature of the condensers 40,50 is regulated by<br>
conventional means known to one of skill in the art. The order of addition of the<br>
reactants is not crucial in the process of this invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates one of a variety of suitable scaled-up reactor systems<br>
100 for industrial operation. The system 100 of Figure 2 comprises a reactor 110,<br>
a collection tank 120, and a series of knock out pots represented here by a single<br>
pot 130. The reactor 110 is charged with catalyst through the bottom of the reactor<br>
110 and with carboxylic acid and optionally solvent via line 114. Acetylene is<br>
bubbled through the reaction medium via line 116 under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The reactor is heated to a predetermined temperature and the temperature is<br>
maintained throughout a reaction time. Vinyl ester product is removed from the<br>
reactor via line 118 and collected in product collection tank 120. Gaseous<br>
substances from the reactor 110 and the collection tank 120 are routed to knock<br>
out pot 130 via line 24. The knock out pot(s) 130 serve to condense product and<br>
solvent vapors, regulate pressure, and dilute non-condensible gases.<br>

As noted above, most of the supported metal catalysts are commercially<br>
available and can be used as such. The catalyst may be activated by drying in a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at around 50-100°C for about 16 hours. The following<br>
example describes a procedure for the preparation of various metal support<br>
catalysts employed in the process of this invention for illustrative purpose only.<br>
Example A<br>
Preparation of 1 weight percent platinum on Carbon<br>
Powdered and meshed carbon (99 g) of uniform particle size distribution<br>
of about 0.2 mm is dried at 120°C in an oven under nitrogen atmosphere overnight<br>
and then cooled to room temperature. To this is added a solution of platinum<br>
nitrate (Chempur®) (1.64 g) in distilled water (16 ml). The resulting slurry is<br>
dried in an oven gradually heated to 110°C (&gt;2 hours, 10°C/min.). The<br>
impregnated catalyst mixture is then calcined at 500°C (6 hours, l°C/min). The<br>
impregnated catalyst is finally dried in an oven at 100°C in an inert atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen for 16 hours.<br>
Table 1 summarizes various supported metal catalysts and ligands that can<br>
be used in the process of this invention to produce vinyl benzoate (VB) selectively<br>
as described herein. Also listed are the selectivity to VB and TONs that can be<br>
attained using these catalyst systems. The Examples that follow provide more<br>
detailed results. It should be noted that similar selectivity and TONs are achieved<br>
for other vinyl esters such as vinyl 2-ethylhexanoate (V2EH) and/or vinyl<br>
neocarboxylates.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Gas Chromatographic (GC) Analysis of the Products<br>
The following procedure illustrates specific GC method that can be used<br>
for the conversion of benzoic acid (BA) to vinyl benzoate (VB). Similar methods<br>
can be readily set-up for other vinyl esters.<br>
The analysis of the products was carried out by GC using a DB-FFAP 0.25<br>
micron column (30 m x0.25 mm). A backflush column CP-Sil 5(lmx 0.25 mm)<br>
was installed to prevent high boiling solvents being analyzed on the main column.<br>
The GC samples were generally prepared as follows. A final reaction mixture<br>
containing the reactant and product(s) (~1 mL) was diluted with toluene (4 mL)<br>
containing a precise quantity of dodecane (the internal standard). The total<br>
mixture was stirred for either 5 or 30 minutes at room temperature in order to<br>
dissolve the reactant and product(s). The 0.04 mL final sample was further<br>
diluted with toluene to ensure correct concentration ranges for the GC analysis. In<br>
 <br>
some cases, the reaction mixture was diluted with 5 mL of toluene and stirred at<br>
room temperature for one hour to dissolve the reactant and product(s).<br>
The peaks of benzoic acid and vinyl benzoate were well separated from<br>
other peaks. Dodecane was used as the external standard, which was well<br>
separated from other peaks in the chromatograph. The GC was calibrated for<br>
benzoic acid and vinyl benzoate by analyzing a set of calibration mixtures. The<br>
GC method was sensitive enough to detect 25 ppm of benzoic acid and 5 ppm of<br>
vinyl benzoate. The following temperature profile was used in this GC method:<br>
50°C, hold time 1 minute, ramp at 20°C/min to 160°C, hold time 0 minute, ramp at<br>
40°C/minute to 250°C, hold time 2.25 minute - the total duration of the run = 11<br>
minutes.<br>
Example 1<br>
A suitable reactor vessel equipped with appropriate inlets and stirring<br>
device was charged with 100 milligrams of benzoic acid and 500 ppm of para-<br>
benzoquinone. The reactor was purged two to three times with nitrogen and a<br>
constant flow of nitrogen was maintained. To this mixture was added 900<br>
milligrams of butyl benzoate with stirring and the mixture was heated slightly if<br>
necessary to dissolve benzoic acid. To this solution was added 50 milligrams of<br>
5% platinum supported on titania with stirring and the entire mixture was heated<br>
to 180°C. The platinum catalyst was dried at 50°C in air for 16 hours prior to use.<br>
At this time acetylene was fed into the reactor at a steady stream maintaining the<br>
pressure of acetylene at 1.7 bars. The reaction mixture was stirred for an<br>
additional 4 hour period. At this time, a sample of the reaction mixture was<br>
removed and analyzed by GC as described above. From the GC analysis it was<br>
observed that 65 milligrams of vinyl benzoate was formed in the reaction mixture<br>
(54 percent yield), the TON was 280.<br>
 <br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst utilized is 5 weight percent platinum on titania, which is<br>
commercially available. The catalyst is dried at 100°C in nitrogen for 16 hours<br>
prior to use.<br>
In a tubular reactor made of stainless steel, having an internal diameter of<br>
30 mm and capable of being raised to a controlled temperature, there are arranged<br>
50 ml of 5 weight percent platinum on titania. The length of the catalyst bed after<br>
charging is approximately about 70 mm.<br>
A feed liquid comprised essentially of a solution of 100 grams of benzoic<br>
acid in 900 grams of toluene. The reaction feed liquid is vaporized and charged to<br>
the reactor along with acetylene and nitrogen as a carrier gas with an average<br>
combined gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of about 2500 hr"1 at a temperature<br>
of about 200°C and a pressure of 22 bar. A portion of the vapor effluent is passed<br>
through a gas chromatograph for analysis of the contents of the effluents.<br>
