A METHOD OF ISOLATING PROGENITORS LIVER CELLS FROM FETAL LIVER CELLS AND THEIR TRANS-DIFFERENTIATION THEREOF<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of isolating liver stem cells from the fetuses of gestation period ranging between 14-20 weeks. Also, it relates to an in vitro method of trans-differentiating liver stem cells into pancreatic cell under specific culture conditions and it use in treatment of diabetes Type I and acute liver failure.<br>
Background and prior art references of the present invention<br>
The term " Hepatic progenitors" refers to an undifferentiated cell which is capable of proliferation and giving rise to more progenitors having ability to generate a large number of mother cells that can in turn give rise to differentiated, or differentiated daughter cells. As used here, the term "progenitor cell" is also intended to encompass a cell which is sometimes referred to in the art as "stem cell". In the preferred embodiment, the term "progenitor cell" refers to a generalized mother cell whose descendents (progeny) specialize, often in different directions, by differentiation.<br>
The term " isolated hepatic progenitors" in the present invention refers to the single or cluster of the hepatic progenitors.<br>
Stem cells and early progenitors have long been known to exist in rapidly proliferating adult tissues such as bone marrow, gut and epidermis, but have only recently been thought to exist in quiescent tissues such as adult liver, an organ characterized by a long cellular life span. The ability of stem cells to self-replicate and produce daughter cells with multiple fates distinguishes them from committed progenitors. In contrast, committed progenitors produce daughter cells with only one fate in terms of cell type, and these cells undergo a gradual maturation process wherein differentiated functions appear in a lineage-position-dependent process.<br>
In adult organisms, stem cells in somatic tissues produce a lineage of daughter cells that undergo a unidirectional, terminal differentiation process. In all well-characterized ineage systems, such as hematopoiesis, gut and epidermis, stem cells have been identified by empirical assays in which the stem cells were shown to be capable of producing the full<br><br>
range of descendants. To date, no molecular markers are known which uniquely identify stem cells as a general class of cells, and no molecular mechanisms are known which result in the conversion of cells from self-replication and pluripotency to a commitment to differentiation and a single fate.<br>
The structural and functional units of the hepatic parenchyma is the acinus, which is organized like a wheel around two distinct vascular beds. Six sets of portal triads, each with a portal venule, a hepatic arteriole and a bile duct, form the periphery, and the central vein forms the hub. The parenchyma, which comprises the "spokes" of the wheel, consists of plates of cells lined on both sides by the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium. Blood flows from the portal venules and hepatic arterioles at the portal triads, through sinusoids which align plates of parenchyma, to the terminal hepatic venules, the central vein. Hepatocytes display marked morphologic, biochemical and functional heterogeneity based on their acinar location (see Gebhardt, Pharmac. Ther., Vol. 53, pp. 275-354 (1990)).<br>
Comparatively, periportal parenchymal cells are small in size, midacinar cells are intermediate in size and pericentral cells are largest in size. There are acinar-position-dependent variations in the morphology of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and glycogen granules. Of critical importance is that the diploid parenchymal cells and those with greatest growth potential are located periportally. In parallel, tissue-specific gene expression is acinar-position-dependent leading to the hypothesis that the expression of genes is maturation-dependent (see Sigal et al., Amer. J. Physiol., Vol. 263, pp. G139-<br>
G148(1993)).<br>
It is currently believed that the liver is a stem cell and lineage system which has several<br>
parallels to the gut, skin and hemopoietic systems (see Sigal et al., Amer. J. Physiol., Vol.<br>
263, pp. G139-G148 (1993); Sigal et al. In Extracellular Matrix, Zern and Reed, eds,<br>
Marcel   Dekker,   NY.,   pp.   507-537   (1993);   and  Brill   et   al.,   Liver  Biology  and<br>
Pathobiology, Arias et al., 3d eds, Raven Press, NY (1994 in press)). As such, it is<br>
expected that there are progenitor cell populations in the livers of all or most ages of<br>
animals.<br>
A lineage model of the liver would clarify why researches have been unable to grow<br>
adult, mature liver cells in culture for more than a few rounds of division, have observed<br><br>
only a few divisions of mature, adult liver cells when injected in vivo into liver or into ectopic sites, and have had limited success in establishing artificial livers with adult liver cells. These impasses are of considerable concern in the use of isolated liver cells for liver transplantation, artificial livers, gene therapy and other therapeutic and commercial uses.<br>
The success of the above-listed procedures requires the use of hepatic progenitor cells which are found in a high proportion of liver cells in early embryonic livers and in small numbers located periportally in adult livers. Because it is desirable to isolate such hepatic progenitors , a need has arisen to develop a method of successfully isolating said hepatic progenitos (liver stem cells).<br>
Diabetes affects 16 million people in the U.S and is caused by the abnormal metabolism of insulin. Normally insulin is produced and secreted by the cellular structures called the islets of langerhans in the pancreas. Diabetes mellitus will frequently reach the stage of life threatening and severely disabling complications which cannot be kept under control by insulin alone. Since last two decades cell transplants programmes have been initiated by many centers around the world which has shown encouraging results. But, the shortage of the cell supply is the main hurdle for the success of cell based therapy. The knowledge of stem cell biology has revolutionized the area of cell biology. Stem cell transplantation appears to be the sole therapy available for the treatment of type I diabetes. Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from matured cells. Firstly, they can renew themselves for long periods through cell division. Secondly, is that under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become other cell type. Other than the embryonic stem cells organ specific stem cells (adult stem cell) have shown much more plasticity than originally thought. Stem cells isolated from one tissue can differentiate into hematopoietic lineages. Similarly, bone marrow derived stem cells can differentiate into several non hemeatopoietic cell type including skeletal muscle, microglia, astroglia and hepatocytes. During embryogenesis, both liver and ventral pancreas appears to arise from the same cell population located with in the embryonic endoderm. Recently much attention has focused on the apparent plasticity of adult stem cells, especially the capability of such<br><br>
cells to transdifferentiate   into cells of other organs. The well studied transdifferentiation mechanism is between liver to pancreas and vise versa.<br>
In various experimental conditions transdifferentaition of pancreas into liver cells has been reported. In hamsters, hepatocytes like ceils can be induced in a regenerating model based on methionine deficiency and the treatment with pancreatic carcinogen N-nitroso-bis (2-oxopropyl) amine. Hepatocytes can be produced in the rat pancreas either from feeding peroxisomal proliferators or in transgenic mice overexpressing keratinocyte growth factor in pancreas. Pancreatic epithelial cells transplanted into liver can also transdifferentiate to hepatocytes. The most reproducible method for inducing hepatocytes in the pancreas copper depletion of the diet in rats. Bartles et al. have shown that these pancreatic hepatocytes exhibit many of the characteristics of the normal hepatocytes; for example, at the level of electron microscope level, they form bile canaliculi between opposing cells, and the hepatocytes also express numerous liver specific proteins including albumin, dipeptidylpeptidase, and alpha 2 macroglobulim . Similarly, transdifferentiation of hepatic cells to pancreatic cells is well reported in literature. Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that rat hepatic stem cells can transdifferentiate into functional pancreatic endocrine harmone producing cells after culture in high glucose concentration environment, insulin production was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. These transdifferentiated cells, when transplanted in streptozotocin induced diabetic animal model. The animals received 200 islet -like clusters exhibited of similarly, Tosh et al. (2002) demonstrated the transdifferentiation of pancreatic cells to hepatocytes in cultures induced with dexamethasone. Further, these cells demonstrated all liver specific enzymes. Isolation of pancreatic progenitors from fetal source is of great clinical potential, because of higher proliferation rate and less imunogenecity.<br>
In present invention, isolated hepatic progenitors from fetal liver and were transdifferentiated to pancreatic cells. Tansdifferentiated cells produced insulin, an important cellular function pancreatic cell type. The efficacy of these TD cells have shown to normalize the glucose levels of streptozotocin induced diabetic animal model. The methods of the invention have been developed with embryonic livers in which there are  significant  numbers  of pluripotent  liver cells  (liver stem  cells)  and committed<br><br>
progenitors (cells with a single fate to become either hepatocytes or bile duct cells). The<br>
present of separation isolated hepatic progenitors is on the basis of size and density. This<br>
is achieved by using centrifugation elutration system. The fraction with smallest size is<br>
separated from other subpopulation of cells. This method gives homogenous population<br>
of hepatic progenitors in a fraction.  This method does not use antibody bound mediated<br>
separation.<br>

Unlike mature liver cells, the hepatic progenitors of the invention generate daughter cells<br>
that can mature through the liver lineage and offer the entire range of liver functions,<br>
many of which are lineage-position specific. Further, the hepatic progenitors of the<br>
invention have a greater capacity for proliferation and long-term viability than do mature<br>
liver cells. As a result, the hepatic progenitors of the invention are better for research,<br>
therapeutic and commercial uses than mature liver cells.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, wherein this invention relates to<br>
method    of    isolating    hepatic    progenitors    from    developing    fetal    liver    and<br>
transdifferentaiting  (TD)  to pancreatic  cells  invitro culture.  The  TD  cells  produce<br>
pancreatic specific harmone (insulin). This invention provides a method for the treatment<br>
of diabetes type-I by transplantating the cells in intrahepatically.<br>
Isolation of hepatocytes by in situ liver perfusion<br>
In the present method aborted fetuses with the gestation period of 13-24 weeks were<br>
taken.  The time interval between fetal death (invitro or in vivo) and the commencement<br>
of liver perfusion is less than two hours. The fetuses are weighed and its crown crump<br>
length is measured in the lateral position.<br><br>
The chest and the abdomen of the fetuses are prepared with antiseptics and the procedure is carried out under strict aseptic conditions. The fetus is draped in supine position exposing the chest and the upper abdomen. A thin polythene catheter of 22-24 guage is introduced into umbilical cord vein and passed down for about 3-5 cms. The cord is then ligated with the catheter in situ. 2 ml of normal saline (containing one drop of 1 in 5000 heparin) is gassed continuously with 100% oxygen and warmed to 37 C. Initially 10-30ml is perfused until the skin of the epigastrum is stetched.<br>
The chest is opened transversely from the 9th costochondrial joint of one side to the other. Longitudinal incisions are taken on both sides along the costochondral junction to reach the level of manubrium sterni. This flap containing the sternum is now reflected towards the head. The pericardium is cut open with scissors and extended to both sides to expose the heart completely which is turned towards the left so the inferior vena cava can be seen entering the right atricum. A second plastic catheter is passed into the vena cava downwards to reach the tip of the hepatic vein and a ligature applied to the inferior vena cava with the catheter in situ. The inferior vena cava proximal to catheter is divided. The perfusate from the liver now flows out through this outlet catheter.<br>
The liver is irrigated continuously with the buffer until the outflow fluid becomes pale to clear. Simultaneously, the abdomen is opened using an upper paramedian incision with care taken not to injure the liver capsule beneath. The abdominal inferior vena cava is clamped. The incision is extended along the subcostal margin towards the flanks on both the sides which gives full exposure of the liver. The initial rate of perfusion is increased from 20-30 ml./min. to 30-50 ml./min. The outflow fluid becomes clear on perfusion with 300-500 ml.<br>
The perfusion is stopped and the liver is gently pressed to express as much irrigating fluid as possible. The inferior vena cava catheter is clamped with artery forceps and collagenase solution (0.050%) in Hank's buffer is perfused until the liver is swollen. The cord catheter is clamped and the enzyme solution kept in the liver for 10 minutes then the umbilical vein at its entrance into the liver is clamped and cut. The thoracic inferior vena cava is clamped near the diaphragm and cut and the liver is separated from all its attachments and removed.<br><br>
The liver is placed in a sterlized Petri-dish in a laminar flow chamber. The liver capsule is removed and tissue is freed of connective and vascular tissue using a scalpel blace. More collaeenase is added to the freed tissue and incubated at 37°C with constant stirring for 20 minutes so that the cell dispersion is complete. It is then filtered serially through nylon meshes of 250, 100 and 40 micron size to remove the vascular and connective tissue.<br>
The cells in suspension are washed with chilled Hank's washing medium containing calcium and magnesium salts" and kept for gravity sedimentation taking the following precautions (a) the pH of the washing solution is kept at 7.4 (b) the Hank's medium is always previously gassed with pure 100% oxygen before being added to the cell suspension. The supernatant containing non-hepatocytic cells is pipetted out. The viable hepatocytes form a light brown colour sediment at the bottom of the flask. The cell suspension is repeatedly washed (3-6 times) with the Hank's medium till a pure hepatocyte suspension is obtained. Medium 199 is then added to the cell suspension which is stored at 4°C.<br>
Isolation of hepatic progenitors (liver stem cells)<br>
The liver cell suspension obtained by collagenase digestion were separated according size and density using centrifugal elutration system. The equipment used was Beckman JE-6 elutration rotor with standard Beckman separator chamber(Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto California). The isolated cells were suspended in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium with 10% Fetal Calf Serum was used as elutration medium and the sample was run at 2500rpm at IOC. Approximately 9ml of the cell suspension were injected into the mixing chamber five fraction of 100ml each were collected at increasing pump flow rate 24 ml /minute. Sixth blow out fraction was collected with the rotor stopped. The eutriated cellls from each fraction were centrifuged at 500xg 10 in cold high speed centrifuge and the pellets were resuspended in Dulbecco's Minmum Essential Medium. The ceils were fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde and processed for Scanning Electron Microscopy as shown in Figure 1.

Characterization isolated mammalian including human   hepatic progenitors (liver<br>
stem cells)<br>
Characterizing stem cells or their progeny in human liver has of course been more<br>
difficult. A number of surface determinants are shared between haematpoietic derived<br>
progenitors and hepatic progenitors (liver stem cells), including c-kit, CD34, and Thy-1<br>
in rodents and c-kit and CD34 in humans.<br><br>
In the present invention the isolated progenitors were found positive for CD34. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the isolated hepatic progenitors .<br>
The elutriated sample were fixed 2.5% gluteraldehyde and viewed under the Scanning Electron Microscope, the cells were viewed as small oval shaped cells. The size was found to be less than 3 micron as shown in figure No. 1.<br>
In the present invention the isolated progenitors CD34 was used as one of the marker to identify hepatic progenitors. The cells were analysed in Flow Cytometer (FACS) using commercially available CD34 (Becton Dickinson USA).<br>
In the present invention the cells were put in invitro culture and the AFP production was assessed by ELISA. Further, AFP secretion decreased from 5th day and disappeared by 10th day. Albumin production was observed from 3rd day of culture and continued. Morphological studies were carried by SEM after isolation and subsequent to a culture. The homogenous population of the 5    fraction of centrifugal elutriated sample was viewed under the Scanning Electron Microscope, the cells were viewed as small oval shaped within size range of 3-5 jaM as shown in figure Nos 1 and 2. Characterising stem cells or their progeny in mammalian including human   liver has of course been more difficult. A number of surface determinants are shared between haematpoietic derived progenitors and hepatic progenitors (liver stem cells), including c-kit, CD34, and Thy-1 in rodents and c-kit and CD34 in humans. Alfafeto production (AFP): A liver specific marker<br>
AFP is a liver specific marker and is also marker of proliferation. AFP also has been postulated as a transient marker of liver stem cells. In the present invention the cells were put in invitro culture and the AFP production was assessed by Enzyme Liked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) The isolated hepatic progenitors continued to produce high level of AFP in vitro culture condition (Figure 1 ) GammaGlutamy Transpeptidase: A proliferative marker<br>
Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase is a marker of proliferation. In the present invention GGT has been used as one of the marker to assess the proliferative property of the isolated human hepatic progenitors. The isolated hepatic progenitors have shown to have high<br><br>
level of GGT levels in the isolated human hepatic progenitors during invitro culture<br>
condition (Figure 2)<br>
Differentiation of hepatic progenitors in invitro culture<br>
Invitro culture<br>
The hepatic progenitors (liver stem cells), may be bipotential or multipotential. They can<br>
differentiate into hepatocyte or cholangiocyte or they may produce other type of cell like<br>
pancreatic cell in a specified culture environment as shown in figure nos. 3 and 4.<br>
In the present invention majority of the hepatic progenitors differentiated to hepatocyte,<br>
with lesser number differentiating to cholangiocytes as shown in figure nos. 5 and 7.<br>
Clinical application of isolated hepatic progenitors<br>
Intrahepatic transplantation of Hepatic progenitors in fulminant hepatic failure<br>
animal model<br>
Hepatocyte transplantation is an attractive therapy for most liver diseases. Our earlier<br>
experience showed that the Intraperitoneal transplantation of human fetal hepatocytes in<br>
fulminant hepatic failure has reversed the disease condition of &gt;50% of the hepatocyte<br>
transplantated cases (Habeebullah et al. Transplantation 1994).<br>
However, the success requires injection of large number of cells (-20 billion cells) and<br>
matured cells  have  limited growth  potential  in  vivo.  Further,  the  introduction  of<br>
substantial numbers of large matured hepatocytes with a diameter 20-25 micron is very<br>
complicated.<br>
Intrahepatic transplantation of hepatic progenitors has several advantages over other<br>
ectopic sites<br>
1   Transplanting cells into the unique hepatic architecture allows interaction with other<br>
hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells;<br>
2.	Proximity   to   hepatocyte-specific   growth   and   differentiation   factors   creates   an environment particularly conducive to hepatocyte engraftment.<br>
3.	Locally   released  mitogens   and   portal-born   hepatotrophic   factors   can   increase transplanted cell numbers.<br>
4.The liver may be an immunological privileged site.<br>
5, Only in the liver would hepatocytes be able to secrete bile into the biliary tree.<br><br>
In the present invention, differentiated cells were transplanted intrahepatically for the treatment of acute liver failure animal model.<br>
•	Massive acute necrosis of liver cells leads to FHF a condition which is<br>
characterized by a sudden onset of progressive jaundice, decrease in size of the<br>
liver, hepatic encephalopathy within eight weeks of acute illness.<br>
•	The mortality rate ranges from 50-90 % primarirly because of associated cerebral edema, sepsis and multiorgan failure.<br>
•	The major problem in FHF is the loss of hepatocytes rtather than a deficiency of proliferation of surviving hepatocytes Therefore salvaging the injured liver in FHF requires liver repopulation.<br><br>
•	Orthotopic Liver Transplantation is the alternative sources for FHF.<br>
•	Only 10 % of patients with acute liver failure receive OLT.<br>
•	Different approaches to treat acute Hover failure include cross circulation, plasma exchange, hemoperfusion, hemodialysis, hemofilteration and exvivo isolated liver perfusions without any significant improvement of survival.<br>
•	The potential successful option might be hepatocyte transplantation.<br>
•	If temporary metabolic support is provided for a short period the damaged liver<br>
could regenerate. If sufficient amounts of viable liver cells can successfully<br>
transplanted to the ALF patient a bridge- to - time can be created to obtain wither<br>
sufficient regenaration of the host liver or to stabilize the patient expecting OLT<br>
in the near future.<br>
Acute Liver Failure animal model (rat)<br>
Acute liver failure injury animal model (rat) was developed injecting single dose of 875<br>
mg/Kg body wt intraperitoneal^.<br>
Animals were divided into three groups<br>
Group I	Only saline<br>
Group II        D-Galactosamine only<br>
Group III       Cell transplantation* after 24 hours of D-Gal induction Site of transplantation: Intrahepatic, by multiple injections at three points. Dosage:  10 X 10A6 million were transplanted intrahepatically after 24 hours of D-Gal induction.<br><br>
Results<br>
1.	Survival following transplantation of Hepatic progenitors  in acute liver<br>
failure animal model<br>
•	None of the animals died in group -I,<br>
•	In group-II, 63% survival was observed, which received the cells intrahepatically,<br>
•	All the animals died in Group-II, which did not receive cell therapy following liver<br>
•	Injury<br>
•	Histopathology of the liver following transplantation in D-Gal injured liver was taken which shows marked improvement in the pathology of the liver. By 25th day liver regained normal architecture as shown in figures 4, 5, and 6.<br>
Conclusion<br>
•	Liver provides necessary conditions for survival differentiation and proliferation for the transplanted.<br>
•	&gt;60% (around 70%) survival in Gr-III shows that transplanted cells provides necessary support to the failing liver.<br>
Transdifferentiation of hepatic progenitors in specified culture condition as shown<br>
in figure no. 6<br>
Culture Condition:<br>
The   isolated  hepatic  progenitors  were  cultured  in  Dulbecco's  Minimum  Essential<br>
Media/HAM'SF-12   (Sigma,  USA)  was  supplemented   with   fungizone   (25   jig/ml),<br>
pencillin (60units/.ml), streptomycin (600 |J.g/ml) (Hi Media Laboratories, India ) with<br>
10% Fetal calf serum. The culture condition were maintained at 37C in water saturated<br>
atmosphere of 5%C02 and 95% air in a C02 incubator.<br>
In cells were cultured with insulin (1 IU insulin/ml) defined media for 24 hours and later<br>
replaced with media without insulin medium. The cells were checked for the production<br>
of Insulin for 10 days (Table 1).<br><br>
Insulin estimation in invitro culture<br>
The insulin was estimated in medium and in the lysed cells. The cultured cells were trypsinised and washed twice with Hanks medium and the cells were lysed by using 0.2% Triton x 100 and spinned at 2000rpm for 5 min the supernatant is collected for the estimation of insulin production by ELISA as per the manfacturer's protocol. In Gr-I cells were cultured with insulin ( 1 IU insulin/ml ) defined media for 24 hours and later replaced with media without insulin medium. In Gr-II cells were cultured in DMEMwithout any growth harmone or any other supplements. The cells were checked for the production insulin. The results showed production of 49uIU/ml, whereas the control, which were not challenged with insulin have shown the production 7uIU/ml.<br>
Cultures Groups<br>
Gr-I : only   Insulin + DMEM<br>
Gr-II without any growth harmone or any supplements<br>
The cultures maintained for 10 days and insulin levels were followed.<br><br><br>
Electron Microscopy of the differentiated Scanning cells<br>
Cultured cells  were fixed in  2.5% gluteraldehyde  and  viewed  under the Scanning Electron Microscope as shown in figure no. 7. Immuno-cytochemical staining for Insulin TD cells<br>
The cultured cells were fixed in 3:1 acetone methanol mixture for 15 min at room temp.<br>
The slides were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated with monospecific<br>
mouse anti human insulin ( Zymed ) for 2 hours. After incubation the slides were washed<br>
with cold PBS and the nonspecific binding is blocked by incubating the slides with 1 %<br>
BSA for 30 min. Then the slides were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated with<br>
FITC conjugated goat anti mouse immunoglobin-G (Sigma aldrich ) for 1 hour in dark.<br>
Again wash the slides with cold PBS then the cells are observed under Leitz flourescent<br>
microscope as shown in figure No. 8.<br>
Development of diabetic animal model.<br>
All the animals received intraperitoneal injection (40 jig /gm) body wt.<br>
Transplantation of Cultured hepatic progenitors<br>
Approximately   three   million   differentiated   pancreatic   progenitors   were   injected<br>
intrahepatically by opening the abdomen under anesthesia in aseptic condition after  24<br>
hours of Streptozotocin injection. Animals  were immunosuppressed by cyclosporin<br>
injection lmg/ kg body weight Blood glucose level was monitored daily for 10 days.<br>
Transplantation study<br>
Seven rats (wistar) were taken in study. Animals were divided in three groups;<br>
Gr-I : Only normal saline<br>
Gr-II: Streptozotocin +TD cells<br>
Gr-III: only Streptozotocin<br>
RESULTS<br>
t\-•	All the animals in group III died by 5   day.<br>
•	Gr-I animals maintained normal glucose level in the range of 97-102 mg/dl.<br>
•	In group-II, glucose levels started falling following transplantation of TD cells intrahepatically as shown in figure no. 9. The blood glucose levels come to the normal within 7 to 10 days.<br><br><br>
