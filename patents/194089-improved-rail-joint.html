The present invention relates to an improved joint for use in a railway track.<br>
A railway track essentially consists of lengths of rails laid end to end to form a continuous stretch on which wheels can run smoothly. For practical reasons of production, transportation and laying as also for the purposes of their elongation / contraction under changes of temperature, the actual length of these rails is limited to certain values. The ends of such rail-lengths have therefore to be joined together to form continuous stretches of track.<br>
The earliest rail joints as per the known art were formed by placing a pair of fishplates adjacent to the rail-ends and bolting them together to the rail-ends using fishbolts. Such standard fishplated joints were found to be much poorer in strength and rigidity as compared to the rails themselves due to different reasons. These were (i) lesser strength and rigidity of the pair of fishplates vis-a-vis the rails, (ii) frequent loosening of fishbolts under traffic vibration, (iii) development of play due to wear-and-tear on the matching faces of fishplates and rails. These reasons gave rise to different problems at the standard fishplated joints such as (i) battering and hogging (or bending-down) of rail-ends, (ii) bending/breakage of fishbolts, (iii) damage to sleepers used under the rails-ends and (iv) damage to the packed ballast used under the sleepers. Due to the above-mentioned reasons standard fishplated rail-joints are recognised as the weakest links in railway tracks.<br>
-2-<br><br>
The weakness  at  the  fishplated  rail-joint is further<br>
aggravated when the gap between the rail-ends  is  larger. At<br><br>
special locations such as on girder bridges, railways, have to<br>
use joints with larger gaps.  At  such  locations, special     <br><br>
joints called  "mitred joints'  have been tried as per the<br>
known art.  Such joints make use of larger section fishplates on one side of rails and the ends of the rails themselves are <br><br>
skew-cut.  Despite adopting these costly steps, the mitred  joints are also weak and suffer from the  defects  of     standard fishplated joints.  In  fact the defects  are more pronounced due to the gaps at the joints being larger.<br>
The weakness at fishplated rail - joints is greatly aggravated when the two adjoining rail-lengths are of unequal cross - sectional area. Locations with such unequal cross-sections have to be unavoidably used by railways near railway stations and in railway switches etc. As per the known art, 'combination fishplates' are used in fishplated rail-joints when the rail-lengths to be joined are of symmetrical profile and of unequal cross - section. Such combination fishplated joints also suffer from the defects as existing in standard fishplated rail - joints . Further , satisfactory combination fishplates are difficult to design, manufacture and use, if the inequality in cross - sectional areas of the two rail-ends is very high.<br>
In the case of fishplated joints for use at railway switches however, even greater difficulties are encountered if the two rail-ends are not only unequal in cross-sectional<br>
-3-<br><br>
area but one of the rail-ends is symmetrical in cross-section<br>
whereas the other is asymmetrical. In such cases, as per the<br>
known art, 'forged-end rail-joints' are used, wherein the end    <br>
of the asymmetrical rail  is forged over a short length to    <br><br>
match the cross-section of the adjoining symmetrical rail<br>
The rail - ends are then joined together using Standard     <br>
fishplated joints. In this solution also, the already known.<br>
defects of fishplated joints persist. Further, adopting this     solution is a very costly one due to the need for forging the <br><br>
rail-ends on a limited scale, since the number of locations needing such joints is relatively fewer.<br>
As per the known art, rail-joints have been welded by any one of several methods to overcome the above-mentioned defects of standard fishplated rail-joints. This solution has solved problems at rail joints to a great extent. However in railway practice, there are several locations where welded rail joints cannot be used and fishplated joints have to be necessarily used. Further, the welded joints pose severe problems in three distinct cases : (i) when the rail-ends to be joined are of unequal but symmetrical cross-section (ii) when the rail-ends to be joined are of unequal cross-section with one rail being of symmetrical profile and the other one being of asymmetrical profile and (iii) when the chemical composition of the steel used in the two rails to be joined is dissimilar. As per the known art. limited success has been achieved with case (i) above, However, no satisfactory solution has been found for cases (ii) and {iii) mentioned<br>
-4-<br><br>
above.<br>
To summarize, each of the solutions as per the known art of making fishplated rail-joints suffer from the defects detailed in the foregoing paragraphs. Even when using welded rail-joints problems persist as highlighted in the previous paragraph.<br>
The present invention addresses the problems faced in fishplated rail-joints of the known art and also provides a cost-effective solution to take care of the problems where welded rail-joints are not possible to be used.<br>
The present invention provides an  improved rail joint for a railway track comprising two rails laid end-to-end and secured to each other, characterized in that -each rail comprises machined portions on the outer sides of the head and foot of the rail-end:<br>
a load-transfer rail is positioned against said machined portions of said rails to be joined, said load-transfer rail having machined portions on the inner sides of its head and foot to match the machined portions of the rail-ends; and bolts join the webs of said rail-ends with the web of the load-transfer rail.<br>
As per the invention,  a portion of the outside head and the outside foot of the rail-ends to be joined together is machined away. A small-length machined rail  called 'load-transfer rail1 (with its inside head and inside foot machined away) is then placed against the machined rail-ends in such a manner that the machined portions match together.  The web of<br>
-5 -<br><br>
the load-transfer  rail  and the webs of the two rail,-ends of the joint are then bolted together with or without the use of<br><br>
special fishplates. In order  to cover the difference between the height of the two rails  and  also  their  web-thickness,<br><br>
suitable packing pieces can be used. Further in order to make the  whole  assembly  stronger and more rigid, one or more of  ^<br>
the following steps as per the  known art may additionally be employed : (i)  Reducing  the  gap  between rail-ends to zero value; (ii) Locating a sleeper directly  under  the centre of the joint: (iii) Using high-tensile  bolts  to join the rail-ends with  the  load-transfer  rail  and  {iii)  Using high-strength synthetic Epoxy resin between the mating surfaces of<br>
the rails to be joined, normally produced by the process of rolling,<br>
The rails,which are mnay be of identical section, or of symmetrical section  and  unequal  cross-sectional area. One of the rails can be of symmetrical section  while  the  other rail is of asymmetrical section. Gap  between  the  rail-ends  may  be of zero-width or of a width in  the range  of 0-15mm or thereabouts. The bolts are preferably high tensile steel bolts.<br>
A fish plate may be located on the side of the  rail-end remote from the load-transfer rail, said bolts  securing the fish plate, rail-ends and the load-transfer-rail together.<br>
A packing piece is preferably provided  below  the foot of one of the rail-ends to adjust  the  height  of  the load-transfer rail to the top level of the heads of the rail-ends. A packing plate may also be provided  between  the web of the transfer-rail and web of one of the rail-ends.<br>
-6-<br><br>
It is also preferable to provide high strength synthetic epoxy resin coatings between  the machined  surfaces of the load-transfer rail and  of the rail-ends. A glass fibre layer,, may also be provided  between the mating surfaces of the load<br><br><br>
transfer rail and of the rail ends.	<br>
It is also preferable to prefabricate such improved rail <br><br>
joints in short compact lengths of 3-13 metres or thereabouts under controlled conditions in a workshop to ensure the soundness of their quality.  The ends of such prefabricated<br><br>
joint can then be welded at site of actual use to the       <br>
corresponding rail-sections using welding processes of the<br>
known art.<br>

Figs. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 show a standard fishplated rail-joint as per the known art. In Fig.1.1, rails 1 and 1' are joined at their ends  using  fishplates 2 &amp; 2, with the help<br>
of fishbolts 3. A gap 4  exists between  the  ends  of rails   . ,,, - ¦¦»«<br>
1 &amp; I1.  The rail-ends are made to  rest  on  sleepers 5. As <br>
per the known art, the gap 4 is sometimes reduced to zero and     "  t<br>
sometimes, the sleeper 5 is located directly under the centre <br>
of the rail-joint as shown in Fig. 1.3,  in order to minimize<br>
the defects in performance of the joint.	<br>
Figs. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 show a 'mitred joint' with a larger gap used at special locations such as girder bridges. In Fig. 2.1 the rails are marked 1 and 1', the inside fishplate is marked 2 and the outside special fishplate is marked 2' and the bolts are marked 3. The gap between rail-ends 4 and the skew-cut rail-ends can be seen in Fig.2.2 Fig 2.3 shows the sectional view of the joint along line B-B in Fig 2.2.<br>
Figs. 3.1,3.2,3.3 show a 'combination fishplated joint1 which is used when joining rail-ends with unequal cross-sectional area and when both the rail sections are of symmetrical profile. 'Rails 1 &amp; 1' , fishplates 2 &amp; 21 , fishbolts 3 and gap 4 have the same connotation as in the earlier Figures.<br>
Figs. 4.1,4.2,4.3  show  a  'forged-end joint'. The rail 1 is of symmetrical profile, while  1'  is  the asymmetrical rail. The end of rail 1' is  forged over a short length to match the  cross-section of rail 1 in order  to  use standard fishplates  2 &amp; 2'.  Fishbolts 3  and  gap 4  have  the  same<br>
-9-<br><br>
connotation as in earlier Figures.<br>
Figs.5.1,5.2,5.3 show a welded rail joint which is normally used when the two rails to be joined are of identical cross-section or when the two rails are symmetrical but have a small difference in cross-sectional area. In Fig. 5.1, the rails are marked 1 and 1'. Welded joints are not normally used when the difference in cross-sectional area  is   high   or  when   one   of  the  rails  is<br><br>
symmetrical in cross-section and the other is asymmetrical.   --<br>
Figs-6.1,6.2,6.3,6.4,6.5   show   an  embodiment  of the joint according to the present  invention  for use when both the rails  to be  joined are  symmetrical  in profile. In Fig.6.1, rail 1 is taller in height than rail I1.  A rail 1A (which is  a rolled piece ofrail identical, in cross-section to the rolled rail 1) is used as a load-transfer rail. Heads and  feet of rails 1, I1 and 1A are machined/contoured to mate closely with each other after assembly. Fig.6.4 shows the cross-section of rolled rail 1  and Fig. 6.5  shows  the cross-section of rolled rail I1. Packing piece 6  is used below end of rail 1' to cater  to  the difference in the height of rails 1A and 1 &amp; 1'.   Special  fishplate 2  can be used as optional measures as shown in Fig 7.2.  Bolts 3 are high-tensile steel bolts and are used to connect the webs of the rail 1A to the webs of rails 1,1'.  Bearing plate 8 is used under the rail as per normal railway practice.  A coat of synthetic epoxy resin or an intermediate glass-fiber layer or both can be used between the mating surfaces of the rails<br>
-10-<br><br>
as an optional measure to increase the strength and rigidity of the joint.<br>
Figures 7.1,7.2,7.3,7.4, and  7.5  show  an  alternative embodiment of the joint of the present invention for use when one of the rails to be joined is symmetrical in profile while the other is asymmetrical. In Fig. 7.1, rail 1  is symmetrical* j while rail I1 is asymmetrical. Load - transfer  rail  1A and- rails 1, I1 are suitably machined / contoured on the foot and head and assembled together. Packing piece 6 is used to  "cater to the difference in the  height  of  rails  1A  and  1 &amp;~ 1 and packing piece 7 is used to cater to the difference in webs of rails.  Special fishplate 2, bolts 3 and bearing   plate 8 have the same purpose and connotation as described under Figs.  6.1 - 6.5.  Use of special fishplate 2 and packing piece 7 is optional.  An optional  coat  of synthetic epoxy resin or an intermediate glass-fiber  layer or both can be used as described with reference to Figs.  6.1 - 6.5.<br><br><br><br>
