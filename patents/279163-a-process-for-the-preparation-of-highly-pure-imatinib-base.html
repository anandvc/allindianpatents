A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIGHLY PURE IMATINIB BASE Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved and novel process for the preparation of highly pure<br>
(&gt;99.8) (Imatinib) of formula (I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and process for preparation<br>
thereof<br>
Back ground of the Invention :<br>
 <br>
imatinib mesylate which is the methane sulfonate salt of N-{5-[4-(4-methylplperazino-methyl)-benzoylamido]-2-methylphenyl}-4- (3-pyridyl) 2-pyrimidine-amine having the Formula I (a) I is approved under the trademark "Gleevec ®" by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia before and after the failure of interferon alpha. It has also been approved for the treatment of patients with kit (CD117) positive unresectable and / or metastatic malignant Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs). It has also been approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic phase.<br>
 <br>
The preparation of N[-{5-[4-(4-methylpiperazino-methyl)- ben2oylamido]-2-methylphenyl}-4- (S-pyridyl) 2-pyrimidine-amine (Imatinib) of Formula (I) and the use thereof especially as an antitumour agent is described in EP0564 409, (Ciba-Geigy corp.) which was published on 6^*^ October1993 and in US 55211584 (Assignee : Ciba-Geigy corp; Title : Pyrimidine derivatives and process for the preparation there of) which was published on 28"' May 1996 and in equivalent applications in numerous other countries. However, the purity aspects of imatinib base are not discussed here.<br>
The preparation of Imatinib mesylate 1(a) and the use thereof especially as an antitumour agent is described in WO99/03854, (Assignee : Novartis). This application describes two polymorphic forms of imatinib mesylate, the a-fomi and the p-form, WO 2005/075454 describes acid addition salts imatinib such as tartrate, citrate, malate, fumarate, etc., which are prepared by treatment of imatinib base with the corresponding acid.<br>
In EP 0564409 and in its equivalent US 55211584 the following route is described (Scheme-1) Scheme -I:<br>
  3<br>
A solution of N-(5-amino-2-methylphenyi)-4"(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidineamine of the formula (11) and 4-(4-methyl-piperazinomethyl)benzoyl chloride of the formula (III) taken in pyridine are stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 23 hours. The resulting reaction mixture is concentrated under high vacuum; water is added and the mixture is filtered. After drying at 80°C under high vacuum, the crude<br>
 <br>
product is made into slurry with methylene chloride &amp; methanol and filtered to yield Imatinib of the formula (I). Chromatographic separation is used to obtain further crop of product.<br>
After implementing the process described in the patent mentioned as per the scheme indicated, the following are the difficulties encountered and draw backs noticed.<br>
i)	the yield of compound of formula (I) is low (50%) making the process non economical and<br>
the purity of the product is only 97%<br>
ii)	column chromatography is necessary to isolate  product of formula (I) in pure form and<br>
column chromatography technique becomes unpractical on commercial scale, iii)        usage of the obnoxious and foul smelling chemical pyridine as a solvent and its distillation for work-up makes this process to be abandoned on bulk scale.<br>
Imatinib base is the precursor of the salt forms of imatinib. As such, there is a need for imatinib base of high purity which may be conveniently used as a precursor in the preparation of highly pure imatinib mesylate for therapeutic application.<br>
It is observed that pharmaceutical salts of Imatinib, when prepared from imatinib of lower purity do not meet the pharmaceutically acceptable quality. There is therefore an unfulfilled need to provide industrially feasible process for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of imatinib from less pure imatinib.<br>
To overcome the problem, the inventors have tried to prepare high purity imatinib base through acid addition salts of imatinib of lower purity. When the base is liberated from the acid addition salts, imatinib of higher purity results.<br>
It is surprisingly found by the inventors that when the impure imatinib is reacted with maleic acid it selectively forms the corresponding acid addition salt, leaving behind the other related substances and impurities which are otherwise difficult to remove by the conventional methods. The maleic acid salt of imatinib is further converted to highly pure imatinib base which in turn is converted into other pharmaceutically acceptable salts with high purity.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of highly pure {&gt;99.8%) imatinib base and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of highly pure (&gt;99.8%) imatinib and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts using maleic acid salt of Imatinib.<br>
Accordingly in the present invention highly pure Imatinib and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are prepared by<br>
i. preparing imatinib base by the condensation of N-(5-amino-2-methylphenyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidlne amine of the fomiula (11) and 4-(4-methyl-piperazinomethyl)benzoyl chloride of the formula (111) in presence of potassium hydroxide base and isolation of crude imatinib base<br>
ii. Treatment of impure Imatinib with hydrochloric acid and again liberation of imatinib of purity g 99.5%<br>
iii. Treating Imatinib with maleic acid yields maleic acid addition salt of Imatinib<br>
iv) neutralizing maleic acid salts and isolating Imatinib of purity 99.99% and<br>
v) converting highly pure Imatinib to other pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
Detailed description of the invention.<br>
Thus in accordance with the present invention preparation of Imatinib and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise the following steps.<br>
i. condensation of N-(5-amino-2-methylphenyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine   and     4-(4-methyl-<br>
piperazinomethyl)ben2oyl chloride of the formula (III) chloroform to yield Imatinib<br>
ii. Treatment of impure Imatinib with hydrochloric acid and again liberation of imatinib of purity 99.5%<br>
iii. Treating crude Imatinib with maleic acid yielding maleic acid addition salt of Imatinib<br>
iv. Converting Imatinib maleic acid addition salt to highly pure(&gt;99.8)lmatinib<br>
