				<td>1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a slide fastener chain for slide fasteners, and more particularly to a slide fastener chain having a multicolor ornamental portion along each of confronting inner longitudinal edges of a pair of its fastener tapes, the ornamental portion being exposed to outside when the slide fastener is used on an article.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
Conventional ornamental slide fasteners each bearing a pattern of design over the entire surface of a slide fastener chain including a pair of fastener elements are disclosed by, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publications Nos. Sho52-47908 and Hei6-9510.<br>
With such a conventional slide fastener chain, since the fastener tapes is usually sewn to rear surfaces of edge portions of an opening of an article to which the slide fastener chain is attached, the pattern of design born over the entire front surface of each fastener tape was concealed by the cloth of the article and could not be seen.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The principle of the present invention is peirticularly useful when applied to a slide fastener chain.  Various preferred embodiments of such a slide fastener chain will now<br><br>
be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a slide fastener chain 1 of this Invention comprising a pair of slide fastener stringers 2,2. Each slide fastener stringer 2 Includes a fastener tape 4, a row of transparent or light-colored coiled fastener elements 3 formed of a thermoplastic synthetic fiber monofilament as of polyamide or polyester, a core cord 5 of synthetic fibers inserted through the row of the coiled fastener elements 3. The coiled fastener elements 3 are sewn to each of the fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting inner longitudinal edges by double-loop-stitches using two threads and a single needle.  For the respective threads 6,7, a multicolor thread 6 Is used as a looper yam and a sewing thread 7 Is used as a needle yarn. Both the multicolor thread 6 and the sewing thread 7 are synthetic fibers, and the multicolor thread 6 is colored with different dyes or pigments In several different colors that are regularly arranged at predetermined lengths. For example, the multicolor thread 6 may be colored in order red A, orange B, yellow C, green D, blue E, deep blue F, etc. like a rainbow color.<br>
Alternatively, the multicolor thread 6 may be colored in different colors arremged at random or irregularly, each colored portion having an arbitrary length.  In another alternative, the multicolor thread 6 may be formed of a plurality of fibers twisted or bound, which are previously<br><br>
colored individually in different colors.  In the resulting multicolor thread 6, various colors are distributed spottedly at all directions.  The reference alphabet S in FIG. 1 designates a slider.<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3 shows a slide fastener chain 1 according to a first embodiment. This slide fastener chain 1 includes a pair of continuous fastener tapes 4, 4, a pair of rows of transparent or light-colored coiled fastener elements 3 sewn to the fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting Inner edges and a core cord 5 inserted through each of the coiled fastener elements 3. Each row of coiled fastener element 3 is sewn by double-loop stitches using two threads and a single needle. Of the two double-loop-stitch threads, a multicolor thread 6 is used as for a looper thread, and an arbitrary-colored sewing thread 7 is used for a needle thread. Owing to the presence of the multicolor threads 6, a neat ornamental portion 8 of rainbow color appears contrastively over a front surface of the transparent or light-colored fastener elements 3. The fastener elements 3 may be dark-colored.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a slide fastener chain 1 according to a second embodiment. This slide fastener chain 1 includes a pair of fastener tapes 4, 4, a pair of rows of coiled fastener elements 3 sewn to the fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting inner longitudinal edges, a core cord 5 inserted through each of the coiled fastener elements 3. Using a multicolor thread 6 as a<br><br>
looper thread, each colled fastener element 3 is sewn to the respective fastener tape 4 by double-loop-stitch threads with two threads and a single needle. The multicolor thread 6 constitutes an ornamental portion 8. On the other hand, each fastener tape 4 Includes a multiplicity of multicolored warp threads 6' near the coiled fastener element 3; thus the fastener tape 4 also has another ornamental portion 8', As a result, the ornamental portions 8 on the front surface of the fastener elements 3 and the ornamental portions 8' of the fastener tapes 4, 4 appear in harmony on the slide fastener chain 1.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a slide fastener chain 1 according to a third embodiment. This slide fastener chain 1 includes a pair of fastener tapes 4, 4, a pair of rows of transparent or light-colored coiled fastener elements 3 sewn to the fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting inner longitudinal edges, and a core cord 5 inserted through each of the colled fastener elements 3. Each row of colled fastener elements 3 is sewn by double-loop stitches using two needles and three threads, i.e. two for sewing threads 7 emd one for a single multicolor thread 6. The multicolor thread 6 constitutes a rainbow-colored neat ornamental portion 8 contrastively over the front surface of the transparent or light-colored fastener elements 3.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a slide fastener chain 1 according to a fourth embodiment. This slide fastener chain 1 includes a pair of fastener tapes 4, 4, a pair of rows of transparent or<br><br>
light-colored coiled fastener elements 3 sewn respectively to the fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting inner longitudinal edges and a core cord 5 inserted through each of the coiled fastener elements 3. Each row of coiled fastener elements 3 is sewn by two parallel double-loop stitches. Each row of the stitches is formed with a single needle and two threads, i.e. a single multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread and a sewing threads 7 as a needle thread.  The two rows of rainbow-colored neat ornamental portions 8 formed of the multicolor threads 6 appear contrastively and clearly on a front surface of each row of the transparent or light-colored coiled fastener element 3; this arrangement is particularly suitable with large-sized fastener elements. These two rows of ornamental portions 8 may be either identical or different in colors; if they are identical with each other, a wide neat ornamental portion 8 would appear on the front surface of each coiled fastener element 3.<br>
The fastener element 3 of a synthetic fiber monofilament should by no means be limited to a coiled type and may alternatively be a zigzag type. FIGS. 7 and 8 show a slide fastener chain 1 according to a fifth embodiment. In this slide fastener chain 1, a pair of rows of zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3 are respectively sewn astride of and to a pair of fastener tapes 4, 4 along their confronting inner longitudinal edges by double-loop stitches using a single needle and two<br><br>
threads, i.e. a single multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread and a sewing thread 7 as a needle thread.  As a result, a rainbow-colored neat ornamental portion 8 appears on a front surface of each row of the zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3.<br>
FIG, 9 shows a slide fastener stringer 2 according to a sixth embodiment. In this slide fastener stringer 2, a row of zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3 is mounted astride of an inner longitudinal edge of a fastener tape 4, and then a white or light-colored narrow blade 9 is placed over a front surface of the row of fastener elements 3, whereupon the row of fastener elements 3 is sewn to the fastener tape 4 by two parallel rows of double-loop stitches with a single needle and two threads in such a manner that multicolor threads 6 as looper threads constitute a pair of rainbow-colored neat ornamental portions 8 appearing contrastively on the white or light-colored narrow blade 9. These two ornamental portions 8 may be identical or different in colors.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a slide fastener stringer 2 according to a seventh embodiment. In this embodiment, like the sixth embodiment of FIG- 9, a row of zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3 is mounted astride of an inner longitudinal edge of a fastener tape 4, and then a narrow blade 9 is placed on a front surface of the row fastener elements 3, whereupon the row of fastener elements 3 is sewn to the fastener tape 4 by two parallel rows of double-loop stitches with a single needle and two threads.<br><br>
using a multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread. The multicolor threads 6 constitute an ornamental portion 8 on the front surface of the blade 9, and the blade 9 also is colored in various colors to constitute a wide ornamental portion 8. The arrangement of colors of each of the multicolor threads 6 and the blade 9 may be selected as desired. The sewing means should by no means be liitated to double-loop stitches with a single needle and two threads.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a slide fastener chain 1 according to an eighth embodiment.  In this embodiment, a pair of rows of transparent or light-colored zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3, through which two core cords 5 are respectively inserted, is mounted on a front surface of a pair of fastener tapes 4 along their inner longitudinal edges, whereupon each row of zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3 is sewn to the respective fastener tape 4 by double-loop stitches with a single needle and two threads, a multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread and a sewing thread 7 as a needle thread.  As a result, the multicolor threads 6 constitute a rainbow-colored neat ornamental portion 8 appearing contrastively on the front surface of each row of zigzag-shaped fastener elements 3.<br>
The row of fastener elements 3 should by no means be limited to a synthetic fiber monofilament and may be molded of thermoplastic resin, such as polyamide, polyester or polypropylene, like a ninth embodiment as shown in FIGS. 12 and<br><br>
13.  As shown in FIGS. 12 cind 13, a succession of fastener elements 3 of thermoplastic resin is molded on a synthetic fiber connecting thread 10 at a predetermined pitch by extrusion molding. Each of the fastener elements 3 is folded about their coupling heads with their opposite legs 11 astride of an inner longitudinal edge of a fastener tape 4. The successive fastener elements 3 are sewn at a succession of recesses 12 on the legs 11 thereof to the fastener tape 4 by double-loop stitches with a single needle and two threads, i.e. a multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread and a sewing thread 7 as a needle thread. The succession of recesses 12 on the front legs 11 are filled with the multicolor thread 6, while a succession of recesses 12 on the rear legs 11 receive the sewing thread 7.  Thus the multicolor thread 6 constitutes a rainbow-colored neat ornamental portion 8 appearing on the front surfaces of the fastener elements 3.  Preferably the fastener elements 3 are while or light-colored so that the ornamental portion 8 thereon can be set off.<br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 show a slide fastener chain 1 according to a tenth embodiment.  In this embodiment, a succession of fastener elements 3 of thermoplastic resin are molded directly on a front surface of a fastener tape 4 along its inner longitudinal edge by injection molding, whereupon the successive fastener elements 3 are sewn at a succession of recesses 12 on the legs 11 thereof to the fastener tapes 4, 4<br><br>
by double- loop stitches with a single.needle and two threads, i.e. a multicolor thread 6 as a looper thread and a sewing thread 7 as a needle thread. The succession of recesses on legs 11 of the fastener elements 3 are filled with the loops of the multicolor thread 6. As a result, a rainbow-colored neat ornamental portion 8 appears on the front surface of the fastener elements 3.<br>
In the foregoing embodiments, the fastener elements 3 are of any of various types. Though the multicolor thread 6 constitutes an ornamental portion 8 on a front surface of the fastener elements 3, it should by no means be limited to as a looper thread and may alternatively be used as a needle thread. As another alternative, the core cord 5 inserted through the fastener elements 3 may be multicolored by suitable means as shown in FIG. 16, in order to make the slide fastener chain 1 much more colorful.<br>
Further, the fastener elements 3 may be colored with a fluorescent dye or may contain a luminous pigment, so that an article to which the slide fastener is attached can be used in night and day. In either case, elegant colors of the multicolor thread 6 should appear on the front surface of each row of the fastener elements 3 as the fastener elements 3 set off the ornamental portion 8 of the multicolor thread 6. The arrangement of colors of the ornamental portion 8 on one slide fastener stringer 2 may be asymmetrical with that of the other<br><br>
slide fastener stringer 2. Or, the opposite stringers 2, 2 may be symmetrical in form and color.<br>
In use, the fastener tapes 4 of the slide fastener chain 1 are sewn to the rear surfaces of marginal portions of an opening at the front part of a garment or wear in such a manner that at least the fastener elements 3 and, the ornamental portions 8 are exposed to outside from the opening.<br>
