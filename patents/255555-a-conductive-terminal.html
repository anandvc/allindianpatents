				<td>CONDUCTIVE TERMINAL WELDING METHOD AND CONDUCTIVE<br>
TERMINAL STRUCTURE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for welding conductive<br>
terminals each made of copper to each other by resistance welding, and a<br>
conductive terminal structure obtained by the method.<br>
(2)	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Typically, a resistance welding method has been used for welding<br>
conductive terminals in an electronic device to each other. An arc welding<br>
method and other welding methods are used rarely due to the following reason.<br>
That is, an amount of electric current to be fed in welding is too large; therefore,<br>
there is a possibility that an electronic component is damaged.<br>
[0003] In resistance welding, when electric current is fed to components to<br>
be welded each of which is resistant to electricity in a state where the<br>
components come into contact with each other, the components are melted by<br>
heat generated owing to the electrical resistance.<br>
[0004] As one example of the resistance welding method, there has been<br>
known a spot welding method (see Fig. 4 in JP2002-095134A and Fig. 2 in<br>
JP2002-281644A). This method involves a step of butting flat-shaped<br>
conductive terminals with each other, a step of bringing the conductive terminals<br>
into contact under pressure with electrodes each having a spherical or convex<br>
tip end such that the conductive terminals are sandwiched between the<br>
2<br><br>
electrodes, and a step of feeding electric current to the electrodes. According<br>
to the spot welding method, a spot-shaped nugget (a melting portion) is formed<br>
at a contact portion between the conductive terminals. As another example of<br>
the resistance welding method, there has been also known a projection welding<br>
method (see Fig. 3 in JP2002-095134A and Fig. 1 in JP05(1993)-283139A).<br>
This method involves a step of butting a first conductive terminal including a<br>
spherical or convex projection against a second conductive terminal, a step of<br>
bringing the conductive terminals into contact under pressure with flat-shaped<br>
electrodes such that the conductive terminals are sandwiched between the<br>
electrodes, and a step of feeding electric current to the electrodes. According<br>
to the projection welding method, the projection itself forms a nugget.<br>
[0005] According to the former spot welding method, conductive terminals<br>
each made of iron or the like can be readily welded to each other. According to<br>
the latter projection welding method, a projection itself forms a nugget; therefore,<br>
a melting state of a weld portion can be relatively stabilized.<br>
[0006] In the spot welding method, however, conductive terminals each<br>
made of copper with considerably small resistivity, in particular, oxygen free<br>
copper with high purity are hardly welded to each other for the following reason.<br>
That is, copper effects less heat generation owing to electrical resistance and<br>
less melting by the heat; therefore, welding becomes difficult. Even when the<br>
surface of the conductive terminal made of copper is subjected to tin plating in<br>
order to ensure electrical resistance to some extent, it is difficult to form a nugget<br>
stably. As shown in Fig. 3 in JP2002-095134A and Fig. 1 in<br>
JP05(1993)-283139A, in the conventional projection welding method, a center of<br>
a tip end portion of a conductive terminal is protruded to form a spherical or<br>
3<br><br>
convex projection. Consequently, it is considerably difficult to enhance an<br>
accuracy of an amount of the projection which is melted into an opposite<br>
conductive terminal to form a nugget. Hence, the formation of the nugget<br>
becomes unstable and, also, a strength (a welding strength) of the nugget<br>
becomes unstable. As shown in Fig. 3 in JP2002-095134A, further, the<br>
projection is formed in such a manner that the center of the tip end portion of the<br>
conductive terminal is protruded. Therefore, it is difficult to spread an area of<br>
the projection. This causes problems that an adequate strength can not be<br>
ensured and an electric current capacity of the nugget is small. In the<br>
projection welding method, similarly, conductive terminals each made of copper<br>
with considerably small resistivity are hardly welded to each other for a reason<br>
that copper effects less heat generation owing to electrical resistance and less<br>
melting by the heat. Therefore, the welding of the conductive terminals<br>
becomes considerably difficult.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] An object of the present invention is to provide a welding method by<br>
resistance welding capable of adequately increasing a welding strength between<br>
two conductive terminals each made of copper, and a conductive terminal<br>
structure obtained by the welding method.<br>
[0008] The conductive terminal welding method according to the present<br>
invention is a method for welding first and second conductive terminals, each<br>
made of a tinned flat copper plate, to each other by projection welding.<br>
[0009] The first conductive terminal is made of a tinned flat copper plate.<br>
Herein, a step portion is formed at a position spaced away from a tip end<br>
4<br><br>
position of the first conductive terminal and a projection is formed at a tip end<br>
portion ranging from the tip end position to the step portion.<br>
[0010] The second conductive terminal is also made of a tinned flat copper<br>
plate. Herein, a weld surface has a size to cover the entire tip end portion of<br>
the first conductive terminal and a weld portion has a sectional area substantially<br>
equal to a sectional area of the tip end portion of the first conductive terminal.<br>
[0011] The first and second conductive terminals are brought into contact<br>
with each other.<br>
[0012] Further, these conductive terminals are brought into contact under<br>
pressure with electrodes equal in electrical characteristic to each other, and then<br>
electric current is fed to the electrodes. Thus, the projection of the first<br>
conductive terminal is melted into and is welded to the weld surface of the<br>
second conductive terminal.<br>
[0013] In the first conductive terminal, the step portion is formed at the<br>
position spaced away from the tip end position, and the entire tip end portion<br>
ranging from the tip end position to the step portion serves as the projection.<br>
Therefore, a nugget is formed in such a manner that the projection having a<br>
large area is melted into the second conductive terminal. Thus, it is possible to<br>
considerably spread an area of the nugget. As a result, it is possible to<br>
increase an electric current capacity of the nugget and to increase a tensile<br>
strength.<br>
[0014] In the second conductive terminal, the weld surface has the size to<br>
cover the entire weld surface of the projection. In the welding, thus, electric<br>
current concentration occurs at an entire interface between a periphery of the<br>
projection and the weld surface. This denotes that the nugget is readily formed<br>
5<br><br>
by the projection.<br>
[0015] The respective conductive terminals (the first conductive terminal and<br>
the second conductive terminal) are molded such that the sectional area of the<br>
tip end portion of the first conductive terminal becomes substantially equal to the<br>
sectional area of the weld portion of the second conductive terminal. This leads<br>
to uniform distribution of electric current to be fed to the respective conductive<br>
terminals in the welding. As a result, a balance between heating values, that is,<br>
a heat balance can be made excellent. The heat balance is an important factor<br>
for stabilizing the formation of the nugget.<br>
[0016] The first and second conductive terminals can be molded in such a<br>
manner that tinned copper plates are subjected to a cutting process and a<br>
bending process repeatedly.<br>
[0017] Next, the projection of the first conductive terminal molded as<br>
described above is superimposed on the weld portion of the second conductive<br>
terminal. Then, the two conductive terminals are brought into contact under<br>
pressure with the electrodes, and welding current is fed to the electrodes. In<br>
order to make the heat balance excellent with certainty, herein, the two<br>
electrodes are preferably equal in electrical characteristic to each other. For<br>
example, each electrode is preferably a tungsten electrode.<br>
[0018] By the feed of the welding current, the projection of the first<br>
conductive terminal is melted into and is welded to the weld surface of the<br>
second conductive terminal. More specifically, the electric current<br>
concentration occurs at the entire interface between the periphery of the<br>
projection and the weld surface of the second conductive terminal. As a result,<br>
the entire projection is melted into the weld surface of the second conductive<br><br>
terminal, and the nugget to be formed has a size corresponding to the area of<br>
the entire projection. Herein, a melting amount of the projection is restricted by<br>
the step portion. In other words, the projection is melted into the weld portion of<br>
the second conductive terminal by a length corresponding to the step portion.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to stabilize the size of the nugget. As a result, it is<br>
possible to stabilize the electric current capacity of the weld portion.<br>
[0019] Herein, the respective conductive terminals are molded to satisfy<br>
relationships L1  T2, in which L1 represents a width of the first<br>
conductive terminal, l_2 represents a width of the second conductive terminal, T1<br>
represents a thickness of the first conductive terminal and T2 represents a<br>
thickness of the second conductive terminal. When the shapes of the<br>
respective conductive terminals are set as described above, the entire projection<br>
of the first conductive terminal can be covered with the entire weld portion of the<br>
second conductive terminal. In addition, distribution of electric current to be fed<br>
to the respective conductive terminals becomes uniform; therefore, an excellent<br>
heat balance can be realized.<br>
[0020] According to a modification of the present invention, the second<br>
conductive terminal is molded such that a step portion is formed at a position<br>
spaced away from a tip end position of the second conductive terminal and a<br>
projection is formed at a tip end portion ranging from the tip end position to the<br>
step portion. That is, the projection is formed on the second conductive<br>
terminal. Herein, the first conductive terminal is formed into a flat shape. In<br>
this configuration, a weld surface of the first conductive terminal is melted into<br>
and is welded to the projection of the second conductive terminal.<br>
[0021] According to this configuration, similarly, electric current<br>
7<br><br>
concentration occurs at an entire interface between the periphery of the weld<br>
surface of the first conductive terminal and the projection. As a result, the<br>
entire first conductive terminal is melted into the weld surface of the projection,<br>
and a nugget to be formed has a size corresponding to the area of the entire first<br>
conductive terminal. Herein, a melting amount of the first conductive terminal is<br>
restricted by the step portion. In other words, the first conductive terminal is<br>
melted into the weld portion of the projection by a length corresponding to the<br>
step portion. Therefore, it is possible to stabilize the size of the nugget. As a<br>
result, it is possible to stabilize the electric current capacity of the weld portion.<br>
[0022] According to the present invention, it is possible to weld two<br>
conductive terminals each made of copper to each other with certainty, and to<br>
ensure an adequate welding strength for formation of a nugget having a large<br>
area.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0024] Fig. 1 shows conductive terminals according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0025] The first conductive terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2<br>
are obtained as follows. That is, two tinned flat copper plates different in<br>
thickness from each other are subjected to a cutting process and a bending<br>
process repeatedly. Herein, the thickness is selected within a range from about<br>
0.4 mm to about 0.9 mm. For example, the first conductive terminal 1 is made<br>
of a copper plate having a thickness of 0.64 mm, and the second conductive<br>
terminal 2 is made of a copper plate having a thickness of 0.4 mm.<br>
[0026] First, the aforementioned copper plates each used as a starting base<br>
material are cut to obtain a flat-shaped conductive terminal having a width of 4.5<br>
mm and a flat-shaped conductive terminal having a width of 5 mm. The<br>
conductive terminal having the width of 5 mm is made of the copper plate having<br>
the thickness of 0.64 mm and serves as the first conductive terminal 1. The<br>
conductive terminal having the width of 4.5 mm is made of the copper plate<br>
9<br><br>
having the thickness of 0.4 mm and serves as the second conductive terminal 2.<br>
The first conductive terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 are<br>
subjected to the cutting process and the bending process as follows.<br>
[0027] (1) The first conductive terminal 1 is molded such that a step portion<br>
10 is formed at a position spaced away from a tip end position of the first<br>
conductive terminal 1 and a projection 12 is formed at a tip end portion 11<br>
ranging from the tip end position to the step portion 10. That is, the provision of<br>
the step portion 10 effects the formation of the projection 12 extending in a<br>
direction of the second conductive terminal 2 in Fig. 1. Thus, a weld surface (a<br>
surface opposite to the second conductive terminal 2 in Fig. 1) 13 of the<br>
projection 12 has an area equal to a size of the entire tip end portion 11. This<br>
molding is carried out in the bending process.<br>
[0028] (2) The respective conductive terminals are molded such that a weld<br>
surface (a surface opposite to the first conductive terminal 1 in Fig. 1) 20 of the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 has a size to cover the entire weld surface 13 of<br>
the projection 12 of the first conductive terminal 1. More specifically, the two<br>
upper sides of the first conductive terminal 1 are cut; thus, the weld surface 20 of<br>
the second conductive terminal 2 is molded to have a size to cover the entire<br>
weld surface 13 of the projection 12 of the first conductive terminal 1. In the<br>
example shown in Fig. 1, the second conductive terminal 2 is already formed<br>
into a plate shape. Alternatively, the second conductive terminal 2 may be<br>
formed into the plate shape at this phase. Moreover, an amount of the copper<br>
plate to be cut for formation of the second conductive terminal 2 may be<br>
determined appropriately as necessary.<br>
[0029] Fig. 2 shows a comparison between the size of the projection 12 and<br>
10<br><br>
the size of the weld surface 20 of the second conductive terminal 2. As shown<br>
in Fig. 2, the weld surface 20 of the second conductive terminal 2 has a hatched<br>
region formed around the projection 12. As will be described later, this<br>
arrangement brings the following advantage. In welding, that is, electric current<br>
concentration occurs at an entire interface 21 between the periphery of the<br>
projection 12 and the weld surface 20. Thus, the entire projection 12 and part<br>
of the weld surface 20 opposite to the projection 12 are melted, so that a nugget<br>
(a melting portion) is formed.<br>
[0030] (3) In the aforementioned process (2), the respective conductive<br>
terminals are molded such that a sectional area S1 of the tip end portion of the<br>
first conductive terminal 1 becomes substantially equal to a sectional area S2 of<br>
a weld portion of the second conductive terminal 2.<br>
[0031] In the aforementioned process (2), the two upper sides of the first<br>
conductive terminal 1 are cut. Herein, a cut amount is set such that the<br>
sectional areas S1 and S2 become substantially equal to each other. In the<br>
example shown in Fig. 2, the second conductive terminal 2 is already formed<br>
into a plate shape. Alternatively, the second conductive terminal 2 may be<br>
formed into the plate shape at this phase. Moreover, an amount of the copper<br>
plate to be cut for formation of the second conductive terminal 2 may be<br>
determined appropriately as necessary.<br>
[0032] When the sectional areas S1 and S2 are substantially equal to each<br>
other, distribution of electric current to be fed to the conductive terminals 1 and 2<br>
in welding becomes uniform, so that a heating value of the first conductive<br>
terminal 1 becomes almost equal to that of the second conductive terminal 2.<br>
In other words, an excellent heat balance can be realized. The realization of<br>
11<br><br>
the excellent heat balance can stabilize the formation of the nugget.<br>
[0033] The projection surface of the first conductive terminal 1 and the weld<br>
surface 20 of the second conductive terminal 2, each of which is molded as<br>
described above, are brought into contact with each other. Further, electric<br>
current is fed to electrodes brought into contact under pressure with the two<br>
conductive terminals 1 and 2, respectively, so that the two surfaces are welded<br>
to each other. Fig. 3 shows a state where the first conductive terminal 1 and<br>
the second conductive terminal 2 are sandwiched between the electrodes 3 and<br>
4. By application of pressure to the electrodes 3 and 4, the first conductive<br>
terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 are brought into contact under<br>
pressure with each other. Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C are a top view, a front view and<br>
a right side view each showing a state of attachment of the electrode. Each of<br>
the electrodes 3 and 4 is a rectangular electrode made of tungsten and has a<br>
single size. When the electrodes 3 and 4 are made of tungsten and are equal<br>
in size to each other, a more excellent heat balance can be realized.<br>
[0034] As shown in Figs. 4A to 4C, the electrode 3 has a size to cover the<br>
entire upper end portion 11 of the first conductive terminal 1. A pressure<br>
contact force F (see Fig. 3) is determined appropriately depending on the<br>
thickness and size of each of the conductive terminals 1 and 2, the amount of<br>
the electric current, and the like. Typically, the pressure contact force F is<br>
selected within a range from 15 kg to 25 kg. Preferably, the pressure contact<br>
force F is, for example, 16 kg. The amount of the electric current is selected<br>
within a range from 10 kA to 20 kA. An electric current feed time is selected<br>
within a range from 20 mm/s to 40 mm/s. Preferably, the electric current<br>
amount is, for example, 10 kA and the electric current feed time is, for example,<br>
12<br><br>
20 mm/s.<br>
[0035] When the electric current is fed to the electrodes 3 and 4 for a<br>
predetermined period of time, the rectangular projection 12 in the tip end portion<br>
of the first conductive terminal 1 and the weld surface 20 of the second<br>
conductive terminal 2 are melted mutually to form the nugget having a size equal<br>
to the projection 12. Figs. 5A to 5C show a temporal change upon formation of<br>
the nugget 5, respectively. Specifically, Fig. 5A shows an initial state in welding<br>
(in electric current feed), Fig. 5B shows an intermediate state, and Fig. 5C shows<br>
a final state. In the initial state where the electric current feed is started, the<br>
resistance of the tinned layer causes electric current concentration occurring at<br>
the entire interface between the periphery of the projection 12 and the weld<br>
surface 20 of the second conductive terminal 2. Thus, the projection 12 and<br>
weld surface 20 start to melt. As a result, the nugget 5 grows (Fig. 5A). In the<br>
intermediate state where the electric current is continuously fed, the projection<br>
12 is further melted into the weld surface 20; thus, the nugget 5 becomes more<br>
larger (Fig. 5B). In the final state where the electric current is continuously fed,<br>
the projection 12 is completely melted into the weld surface 20; thus, the nugget<br>
5 grows at maximum (Fig. 5C).<br>
[0036] The final state corresponds to a state where a height t of the step<br>
portion 10 becomes zero, that is, a state where the first conductive terminal 1<br>
and the second conductive terminal 2 come into contact with each other at a<br>
position below the step portion 10. In this state, the projection 12 is not melted<br>
into the weld surface 20 any more. Accordingly, a melting amount of the<br>
projection 12, that is, a maximum size of the grown nugget 5 is almost<br>
determined by the height t of the step portion 10.<br>
13<br><br>
[0037] With this behavior, the nugget 5 is formed in the weld surface 20.<br>
The area of the nugget 5 corresponds to the upper end portion 11 formed above<br>
the step portion 10. Therefore, it can be said that the area of the nugget 5 is<br>
considerably large. Thus, the welding strength between the two conductive<br>
terminals 1 and 2 can be adequately increased. Moreover, the melting amount<br>
of the projection 12 is restricted by the step portion 10. After completion of the<br>
welding, therefore, a space between the first conductive terminal 1 and the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 is substantially fixed at all times as shown in Fig.<br>
5C.<br>
[0038] Herein, Figs. 5A to 5C schematically show the rectangular<br>
parallelepiped-shaped nugget 5. In actual, the interface of the nugget is<br>
unclear; therefore, irregularities may occur.<br>
[0039] (Experimental Example)<br>
The first conductive terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 were<br>
made of copper plates each having a tinned layer formed thereon. Each of the<br>
copper plates has the following electrical characteristics.<br>
[0040] Copper (resistivity: 1.72 |iQ»cm, conductivity: 100)<br>
Tin (resistivity: 11.4 ^Q»cm, conductivity: 15.1)<br>
The first conductive terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 were<br>
molded such that the shapes and dimensions thereof satisfy parameters shown<br>
in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, numeric values are expressed in a unit of "mm". That is,<br>
the first conductive terminal 1 has a width L1 of 3 mm and a thickness T1 of 0.64<br>
mm, and the second conductive terminal 2 has a width L2 of 4.5 mm and a<br>
thickness T2 of 0.4 mm. A relationship in width between the conductive<br>
terminals 1 and 2 is L1 
14<br><br>
conductive terminals 1 and 2 is T1 &gt; T2. Herein, the height t of the step portion<br>
10 is 0.1 mm.<br>
[0041 ] Herein, the sectional area of the tip end of the first conductive terminal<br>
1 is calculated from a formula: 1.92 mm2, and the sectional area of the tip end of<br>
the second conductive terminal 2 is calculated from a formula: 1.8 mm2. The<br>
two sectional areas are substantially equal to each other.<br>
[0042] The conductive terminals 1 and 2 are butted against each other, and<br>
then outer ends of the conductive terminals 1 and 2 are brought into contact<br>
under pressure with the tungsten electrodes (see Fig. 3). A pressurizing force<br>
herein was 16 kg. Moreover, an amount of electric current to be fed to the<br>
electrodes was 10 A, and a voltage hereat was 10 V.<br>
[0043] Fig. 7 shows results of measurement about "the melting amount of<br>
the projection 12" and "the strength between the conductive terminals (the<br>
welding strength)" in a state where the electric current feed time is changed<br>
within a range from 20 ms to 40 ms under the aforementioned conditions in the<br>
welding. Herein, the former melting amount was measured in such a manner<br>
that the first and second conductive terminals 1 and 2 welded to each other by<br>
the welding are separated from each other. Moreover, the latter welding<br>
strength was measured as a tensile strength upon separation of the conductive<br>
terminals.<br>
[0044] As shown in Fig. 7, the melting amount of the projection 12 became<br>
substantially equal to the height t (= 0.1 mm) of the step portion 10 irrespective<br>
of the electric current feed time. Moreover, the strength between the<br>
conductive terminals was changed from 13.7 kg to 15.94 kg in accordance with<br>
the electric current feed time. At least, the strength had a value vastly<br>
15<br><br>
exceeding 10 kg.<br>
[0045] When the conductive terminals are separated from each other in a<br>
state where the strength between the conductive terminals has a value<br>
exceeding 10 kg, the base material of the conductive terminal is damaged.<br>
This implies that the conductive terminals are sufficiently welded to each other.<br>
[0046] Fig. 8 shows conductive terminals according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0047] This embodiment is different from the previous embodiment in the<br>
shapes of the first and second conductive terminals 1 and 2. In this<br>
embodiment, that is, the first conductive terminal 1 includes no step portion 10,<br>
but the second conductive terminal 2 includes a step portion 21. Specifically,<br>
the respective conductive terminals have the following structures (4) to (7).<br>
[0048] (4) The second conductive terminal 2 is molded such that the step<br>
portion 21 is formed at a position spaced away from a tip end position of the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 and a projection 23 is formed at a tip end portion<br>
ranging from the tip end position to the step portion 21.<br>
(5)	The respective conductive terminals 1 and 2 are molded such that a<br>
weld surface 13 of the first conductive terminal 1 has a size to be covered with<br>
the entire projection 23 of the second conductive terminal 2.<br>
(6)	The respective conductive terminals 1 and 2 are molded such that a<br>
sectional area S2 of the tip end portion 22 of the second conductive terminal 2<br>
becomes substantially equal to a sectional area S1 of a weld portion of the first<br>
conductive terminal 1.<br>
(7)	The weld surface 13 of the first conductive terminal 1 is melted into and<br>
is welded to the projection 23 of the second conductive terminal 2.<br>
16<br><br>
[0049] As in the previous embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the first conductive<br>
terminal 1 is made of a copper plate having a thickness of 0.64 mm, and the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 is made of a copper plate having a thickness of 0.4<br>
mm in this embodiment.<br>
[0050] The welding of the conductive terminals 1 and 2 is performed as in<br>
the previous embodiment. Figs. 9A to 9C show a temporal change upon<br>
formation of a nugget 5, respectively. Specifically, Fig. 9A shows an initial state<br>
in welding (in electric current feed), Fig. 9B shows an intermediate state, and Fig.<br>
9C shows a final state. In the initial state where the electric current feed is<br>
started, resistance of a tinned layer causes electric current concentration<br>
occurring at an entire interface between the projection 23 and the weld surface<br>
13 of the first conductive terminal 1. Thus, the projection 23 and weld surface<br>
13 start to melt. As a result, the nugget 5 grows (Fig. 9A). In the intermediate<br>
state where the electric current is continuously fed, the weld surface 13 is further<br>
melted into the projection 23; thus, the nugget 5 becomes more larger (Fig. 9B).<br>
In the final state where the electric current is continuously fed, the weld surface<br>
13 is completely melted into the projection 23; thus, the nugget 5 grows at<br>
maximum (Fig. 9C).<br>
[0051] The final state corresponds to a state where a height t of the step<br>
portion 21 becomes zero, that is, a state where the first conductive terminal 1<br>
and the second conductive terminal 2 come into contact with each other at a<br>
position below the step portion 21. In this state, the weld surface 13 is not<br>
melted into the projection 23 any more. Accordingly, a melting amount of the<br>
weld surface 13 into the projection 23, that is, a maximum size of the grown<br>
nugget 5 is almost determined by the height t of the step portion 21.<br>
17<br><br>
[0052] With this behavior, the nugget 5 is formed in the projection 23. The<br>
area of the nugget 5 corresponds to a portion above the first conductive terminal<br>
1. Therefore, it can be said that the area of the nugget 5 is considerably large.<br>
Thus, the welding strength between the two conductive terminals 1 and 2 can be<br>
adequately increased. Moreover, the melting amount of the weld surface 13 of<br>
the first conductive terminal 1 into the projection 23 is restricted by the step<br>
portion 21. After completion of the welding, therefore, a space between the first<br>
conductive terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 is substantially fixed<br>
at all times as shown in Fig. 9C.<br>
[0053] In the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 8, one of the first conductive<br>
terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 includes the step portion and<br>
the projection. Alternatively, each of the two conductive terminals may include<br>
the step portion. With this configuration, similarly, the aforementioned nugget<br>
is formed at a portion where the two conductive terminals come into contact with<br>
each other.<br>
[0054] Herein, the strength varies by the change in parameters such as the<br>
pressurizing force, the electric current value and the electric current feed time.<br>
In any cases, a phenomenon that "copper is welded" is observed.<br>
[0055] The present invention can be applied to, for example, a control device<br>
for an electric power steering system (EPS). The control device has the<br>
following configuration. That is, the first conductive terminal and the second<br>
conductive terminal are attached to a substrate and a housing, respectively, and<br>
are welded to each other after assembly of the substrate and the housing. The<br>
present invention is particularly suitable for the device having the<br>
aforementioned characteristics.<br>
18<br><br>
[0056] Fig. 10 shows the configuration of the EPS control device. In order<br>
to receive a large amount of electric current, the EPS control device adopts an<br>
aluminum housing 6 as the aforementioned housing from the viewpoint of high<br>
heat releasing performance. Then, a resin substrate 7 is attached to the<br>
aluminum housing 6 through an engagement portion 60 and the like; thus, the<br>
control device is configured. Although not shown in Fig. 10, further, an<br>
aluminum substrate is interposed between the resin substrate 7 and the<br>
aluminum housing 6, and electronic components such as a switching element,<br>
which rise in temperature upon activation, are mounted on the aluminum<br>
substrate.<br>
[0057] In the aforementioned control device, the first conductive terminal 1<br>
and the second conductive terminal 2 each made of copper are welded to each<br>
other at a portion indicated by a symbol "A" in Fig. 10. The first conductive<br>
terminal 1 and the second conductive terminal 2 are identical to those shown in<br>
Figs. 1 to 3. One end of the second conductive terminal 2 is soldered to the<br>
aluminum substrate. Further, a lower end portion of the first conductive<br>
terminal 1 is attached to the resin substrate 7 by insert molding while being bent.<br>
When the resin substrate 7 is attached to the aluminum housing 6, the first<br>
conductive terminal 1 attached to the resin substrate 7 by insert molding and the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 soldered to the aluminum substrate provided in the<br>
aluminum housing 6 come into contact with each other at the portion indicated<br>
by the symbol "A" in Fig. 10. In this state, the two conductive terminals are<br>
welded to each other by resistance welding.<br>
[0058] In this embodiment, the second conductive terminal 2 is soldered to<br>
the aluminum substrate provided in the aluminum housing 6 and the first<br>
19<br><br>
conductive terminal 1 is attached to the substrate 7 by insert molding. As for an<br>
attaching strength, the former case is weaker than the latter case (that is, the<br>
soldering is weaker than the insert molding). Therefore, the thickness of the<br>
second conductive terminal 2 is smaller than the thickness of the first conductive<br>
terminal 1. With this configuration, even when an external force is applied to<br>
the second conductive terminal 2, the entire terminal becomes deformed<br>
plastically or deformed elastically. Thus, such an external force is alleviated.<br>
As a result, it is possible to prevent an external force from being applied to the<br>
soldered portion. On the other hand, the first conductive terminal 1 is attached<br>
by insert molding which is larger in attaching strength. Therefore, application of<br>
an external force exerts no influence on the electrical connection portion.<br>
[0059] As described above, the present invention is usefully applied to an<br>
electronic device in which conductive terminals made of copper must be welded<br>
to each other after assembly of a substrate and a housing.<br>
[0060] According to the present invention, as described above, it is possible<br>
to weld two conductive terminals each made of copper to each other by<br>
resistance welding with certainty and to ensure an adequate tensile strength for<br>
formation of a nugget having a large area.<br>
