				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is about a method for manufacturing filtering baskets for filtering<br>
machines of fibres in aqueous suspension.<br>
The invention is about as well a filtering basket obtained according to the<br>
teachings of said method.<br>
It is known that, in paper manufacture, the aqueous suspensions containing<br>
cellulose fibres have to be properly filtered to separate any present impurities<br>
therefrom before being used in the productive process.<br>
The filtering is performed through mechanical refiners, inside which the<br>
aqueous suspension is separated from the impurities and the pollutant<br>
substances contained therein to be sent to the subsequent processing.<br>
All the mechanical refiners belonging to the prior art, although in their different<br>
specific embodiments, substantially consist of a fixed filtering basket having its<br>
side surface provided with calibrated openings, in which a rotor is internally<br>
disposed, with the function of maintaining the suspension mixed enough to<br>
avoid the stoppage of the calibrated openings caused by the unfiltered<br>
material.<br>
The fixed filtering basket has its side surface consisting of a plate provided with<br>
a plurality of holes or, alternatively, with a plurality of notches generally<br>
disposed according to the longitudinal axis of said basket.<br>
According to other more modern known embodiments, the baskets consist of a<br>
plurality of mainly longitudinal developed metal bars, having a substantially<br>
trapezoidal cross sectional shape and disposed according to a cylindrical<br>
surface.<br>
In particular, the bars are mutually parallel disposed side by side and they are<br>
supported by a plurality of mutually coaxial and spaced annular elements, to<br>
which they are fixed at the inner circumference.<br>
The filtering surface thus defined consists of the plurality of slots formed by the<br>
mutually adjacent bars.<br>
In such a way, filtering baskets of greater efficiency are obtained because they<br>
have a greater useful filtering surface, being equal the overall side surface,<br>
with respect to the embodiments of known type.<br>
The bars and the annular elements are generally made of stainless steel and<br>
the bars are mutually disposed side by side, in proper seats obtained in the<br>
annular elements supporting them.<br>
The fixing of the bars to the annular elements is performed by welding or,<br>
according to other embodiments, by direct clinching or by the interposition of<br>
support elements.<br>
In further embodiments, the rings can be made of carbon fibre and the bars are<br>
fixed to the seats through adhesive substances.<br>
Filtering baskets having the aforementioned characteristics are disclosed in the<br>
documents WO03091496, US6131743 and WO03102297.<br>
However, the cited known filtering baskets have some acknowledged<br>
inconveniences.<br>
A first inconvenience is due to the constructional complexity coming from the<br>
need to arrange, on each support annular element, the proper seats for<br>
housing the bars and subsequently for performing their fixing by welding,<br>
adhesive substances or clinching.<br>
Another inconvenience is due to the difficulty to maintain constant, with<br>
reduced tolerance, the distance between adjacent bars, both during<br>
manufacture and when the manufacture is completed, in order to maintain<br>
constant the width of the slots for the entire basket length.<br>
The achievable tolerance is defined by the sum of the manufacturing<br>
tolerances of the seats in the support annular elements, the deformations due<br>
to the clinching or the welding of the shaped bars and the shape constancy of<br>
said bars.<br>
In particular recent embodiments, where the size of the slots is close to the<br>
size of the fibres to be treated, this tolerance becomes extremely important for<br>
a good efficiency of the filtering process.<br>
A further inconvenience is due to the fact that vibrations occur during<br>
operation, frequently causing breakings due to fatigue.<br>
In fact, such breakings occur in the clinching or welding points of the bars to<br>
the support annular elements, where the concentration of tensions is a starting<br>
point of possible fatigue breakings.<br>
Another inconvenience is due to the fact that the number of bars, and<br>
consequently of filtering slots, which can be provided in the cited known<br>
baskets is limited by the minimum thickness that each bar must have to be<br>
welded, glued or clinched in the seat obtained on the annular elements, which<br>
evidently cannot have a high density not to compromise the mechanical resistance of<br>
the annular element.<br>
The present invention intends to overcome the aforementioned inconveniences.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a first object of the invention to provide for a filtering basket for filtering machines<br>
of fibres in aqueous suspension which simplifies the known constructional technique,<br>
reducing the number of machining operations, the number of components and<br>
consequently the production costs. It is another object of the invention to provide for a<br>
filtering basket in which it is possible to obtain a greater filtering surface with respect to<br>
the cited prior art. It is a further object of the invention to provide for a filtering basket<br>
which is more fatigue-resistant and consequently of higher durability with respect to the<br>
cited known baskets.<br>
Said objects are obtained by providing for a method for manufacturing filtering baskets<br>
for filtering machines of fibres in aqueous suspension, characterized in that said<br>
method comprises the following steps :<br>
- preparing a plurality of mainly longitudinal developed shaped bars ;<br>
- disposing said shaped bars side by side one close to another, at least some<br>
of said shaped bars having the contact surfaces with the adjacent shaped bars<br>
belonging to mutually convergent planes, to define a tubular structure having a<br>
central longitudinal axis ;<br>
- externally encircling said shaped bars by means of two or more annular<br>
elements, said annular elements being mutually coaxial according to said longitudinal<br>
axis and being mutually spaced apart.<br>
The present invention also provides a filtering basket for filtering machines of fibres in<br>
aqueous suspension, characterised in that said filtering basket comprises :<br>
- a plurality of mainly longitudinal developed shaped bars disposed side by side<br>
one close to another, at least some of said shaped bars having the contact surfaces<br>
with the adjacent shaped bars belonging to mutually convergent planes, to define a<br>
tubular structure having a central longitudinal axis ;<br>
- two or more mutually coaxial annular elements, mutually spaced according to<br>
said longitudinal axis, externally coupled with said shaped bars with radial<br>
interference to provide for the encircling of said shaped bars.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the longitudinal axis of the basket is parallel to<br>
the directions defined by the shaped bars, so that the basket takes a tubular cylindrical<br>
shape in which the shaped bars form the side surface and the longitudinal directions<br>
defined by the shaped bars form as many generatrixes therein.<br>
Advantageously, the use of shaped bars disposed side by side and encircled by means<br>
of the annular elements simplifies the constructional technique of the baskets and<br>
reduces their productive costs. In fact, the machining operations of discs engraving, of<br>
any bars treatment and of fixing by welding, gluing or other are avoided.<br>
More advantageously, the use of shaped bars disposed side by side allows to increase<br>
the filtering surface, being equal the side surface of the basket, with a consequent<br>
higher efficiency of the aqueous suspension filtering process.<br>
Still advantageously, being the bars mutually coupled in an integral way, the tolerance<br>
which can be obtained at the slots is exclusively connected to possible imperfections of<br>
the shaped bars profile.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The filtering basket of the invention is shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, where it is generally<br>
indicated with numeral 1.<br>
It is applied to machines for filtering fibres in aqueous suspension and,<br>
according to the invention, it comprises a plurality of mainly longitudinally<br>
developed shaped bars 3, 4 disposed side by side one close to another.<br>
The shaped bars 3, 4 have the contact surfaces 5, 6, 7, 8 with the adjacent<br>
shaped bars 3, 4 belonging to mutually convergent planes to define, once<br>
disposed side by side, a tubular structure 9 having a central longitudinal axis X<br>
substantially parallel to the longitudinal directions defined by the shaped bars<br>
3,4.<br>
The filtering basket 1 further comprises two or more mutually coaxial and<br>
mutually spaced according to the longitudinal axis X annular elements 10,<br>
externally coupled with the shaped bars 3, 4.<br>
The annular elements 10 are coupled with radial interference to provide for<br>
encircling the shaped bars 3, 4 and to stably constrain the tubular structure 9<br>
defined therefrom.<br>
As one can see in FIG. 3, the shaped bars 3, 4 comprise a substantially<br>
trapezoidal shaped head 11, with the longer base 11a turned toward the<br>
interior of the basket 1 and a substantially parallelepipedal shaped body 12, 13<br>
of reciprocal bearing.<br>
The coupling of the bearing surfaces 5, 6, 7, 8 of each shaped bar 3, 4 with the<br>
adjacent ones is made stable by the presence of mutually joinable concavities<br>
16, 17 and insertion protuberances 14, 15, provided on the body 12, 13 of<br>
each shaped bar 3, 4.<br>
The embodiment of FIG. 3 comprises a first 3 and a second 4 series of shaped<br>
bars, which are alternately disposed side by side to provide for the tubular<br>
structure 9.<br>
In particular, all the shaped bars 3 comprise a continuous body 12, of<br>
substantially symmetrical shape with respect to the longitudinal plane a<br>
passing through the longitudinal axis Y defined by the shaped bar 3, on which<br>
protuberances 14, 15 for the insertion in corresponding concavities 16, 17<br>
made on the body 13 of the shaped bars 4 are obtained, said body 13 being of<br>
symmetrical shape too but having missing portions 13a.<br>
The missing portions 13a are such to define C shaped recesses disposed<br>
along the longitudinal axis Y, with constant pitch, on the body 13 of the shaped<br>
bars 4.<br>
In such a way, when the shaped bars 3, 4 are mutually disposed side by side,<br>
the presence of missing portions 13a on the body 13 of the shaped bars 4<br>
defines a drainage chamber 18 from which the filtered suspension exits.<br>
According to this embodiment, the width of the body 12, 13 is greater than the<br>
width of the longer base 11a of the head 11, which is disposed centred with<br>
respect to the longitudinal plane a to define a plurality of slots 19 able to<br>
provide for the filtering surface of the basket 1.<br>
The executive embodiment 100, shown in FIGs. from 6 to 9, differs from the<br>
previously described one in that the all shaped bars 20 are equal and they all<br>
have portions 21a recessed in the body 21 at the side surface turned toward<br>
the adjacent shaped bar 20.<br>
The body 21 of each shaped bar 20 is provided with concavities 23 on one<br>
contact surface 25 and with insertion protuberances 22 on the other contact<br>
surface 24, joinable one to another, able to allow the coupling to define the<br>
tubular structure.<br>
The head 26 of the shaped bar 20, of substantially trapezoidal shape, is<br>
disposed in an eccentric position with respect to the longitudinal symmetry<br>
plane P of the bar 20, where the width of the longer base 26a is lower than the<br>
width of the body 21, to define a plurality of slots 27 which provide for the<br>
filtering surface of the basket 100 when the shaped bars 20 are disposed side<br>
by side.<br>
In both the described embodiments 1, 100 the missing portions 13a and the<br>
recessed portions 21a are comprised between two adjacent annular elements<br>
10.<br>
In order to provide for filtering baskets having different diameters, some<br>
shaped bars have contact surfaces belonging to mutually convergent planes,<br>
with an angle being a function of the basket final diameter.<br>
Concerning the heads 11, 26 of the shaped bars 3, 4, 20, they all have the<br>
same shape and size in all the described and shown executive embodiments<br>
1, 100.<br>
In the filtering basket of the invention, according to the teachings of the<br>
international published application WO03102297, filed by the same applicant<br>
of the present invention, the heads of the shaped bars could be disposed at<br>
not constant radial distances with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tubular<br>
structure.<br>
In particular, the shaped bars comprise first shaped bars and second shaped<br>
bars, where the heads of the first shaped bars and the second shaped bars<br>
are disposed according to circumferences coaxial with the tubular structure<br>
longitudinal axis and they have different radiuses.<br>
The heads of the first and second shaped bars are disposed according to a<br>
first and a second circumference, where the first circumference has a lower<br>
radius with respect to the second circumference radius.<br>
The surface turned toward the interior of the basket of each of the first shaped<br>
bars head is orthogonally disposed with respect to the first circumference<br>
radius, while the surface turned toward the interior of the basket of each of the<br>
second shaped bars head is inclined with respect to the second circumference<br>
radius.<br>
Operatively, to proceed for coupling and manufacturing the filtering basket 1,<br>
100, the shaped bars 3, 4, 20 have to be disposed side by side, as shown in<br>
FIGs. 3 and 7.<br>
The shaped bars 3, 4, 20 are disposed side by side with the contact surfaces<br>
5, 6, 24, 25, so that the joined profiles 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23 consisting of the<br>
concavities 16, 17, 23 and the insertion protuberances 14, 15, 22 present on<br>
the bodies 12, 13, 21 are coupled, as shown in FIGs. 4 and 8, to form the<br>
tubular structure 9.<br>
At this point, the annular elements 10 are externally coupled, with radial<br>
interference, with the tubular structure 9 to obtain the encircling of the shaped<br>
bars 3, 4, 20 and to give stability and stiffness to the filtering basket 1, 100.<br>
On the basis of the aforesaid description, it should be understood that the<br>
filtering basket 1, 100 of the invention, in all the described embodiments,<br>
achieves all the intended objects.<br>
In particular, it is achieved the object to provide for a filtering basket for filtering<br>
machines of fibres in aqueous suspension which simplifies the known<br>
constructional technique and reduces its productive costs.<br>
In fact, the machining operations of discs engraving, of any bars treatment and<br>
of fixing by welding, gluing or other are avoided.<br>
It is achieved the object to provide for a filtering basket in which it is possible to<br>
obtain a greater filtering surface with respect to the cited prior art, being equal<br>
the side surface of the basket, with a consequent higher efficiency of the<br>
aqueous suspension filtering process.<br>
It is achieved the object to provide for a filtering basket which is more fatigue-<br>
resistant and consequently of higher durability with respect to the cited known<br>
baskets.<br>
It is finally achieved the object to obtain a reduced size tolerance of the filtering<br>
basket slots.<br>
Modifications and variations to the filtering basket of the invention, not<br>
described and not shown in the drawings, could be introduced in the executive<br>
stage.<br>
All the described and any other not cited embodiments, if they fall within the<br>
scope of protection of the following claims, should be intended as protected by<br>
the present patent.<br>
