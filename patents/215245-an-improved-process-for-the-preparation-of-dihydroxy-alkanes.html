				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of dihydroxy alkenes using titanium silicate and particularly to a process for preparation of mixture of 1,4-and<br>
1,2-butenediols from  1,3-butadiene.     More particularly this invention relates to a Heterogeneous catalytic process for  1,4- and   1,2- dihydroxylation of 1,3- butadiene to 1,4-butenediol  and    1,2-butenediol, wherein a mixture of 1,3-butadiene, water and an oxidant is contacted with a catalyst in a polar solvent.<br>
1,4-Butenediol is an important industrial chemical. For example, it is used in the production of endosulphone, chlorinated bicycle [2.2.1]heptene-(2)-bis-(oxyalkylene 5,6) sulphite as insecticide and vitamin B6. It is hydrogenated to a versatile intermediate for the chemical intermediate 1,4-butanediol which in turn is used in the product of polyurethanes and poly(butylene terephthalate)polyurethanes and also used to prepare the useful industrial solvent tetrahydrofuran and can be converted to -butyrolactone which in turn can be converted into polyvinylpyrrolidone and N-methylpyrrolidinone. 1,2-Butanediol is used for modified polyester and polyurethanes without the use of CFC's.<br>
In the prior art, preparation of 1,4-butenediol is achieved by several methods. There are five methods known by which 1,4-butenediol (also known as 2-butene-l,4-diol) can be manufactured. The first method involves the partial hydrogenation of 2-butyne-l,4-diol using catalysts Ni-Cr (Ref: U.S.S.R. (1973) 391,123) and Pd-Cu/BaSO4 (Ref: Ger. (East) Offen. DD (1987) 249,709).<br>
The second method involves the halogenation (X=C1, Br) of 1,3-butadiene using copper bromides or chlorides to produce 1,4-dihalo-2-butene which was further hydrolysed to 1,4-butenediol (Ref. U.S.U S (1980) 4,306,100).<br><br>
The oxidation of butadiene with oxidant.s such as O and H2O2 using various catalyst such as 5% Pd/C-Phl rRef: Jpn K.okni Koho JP (1984) 59 84,8;; i',, CuBr and other Ni, Co, Cr, Mn catalysts (Ref: Eur.Pat. Appl. (1979) 1325), Pd/NaOAc (Ref:Japan (1974) 74 48,292) constitutes the third method.<br>
In the fourth method, transcsterificaticn of the 1,4-butenediacetate which can be prepared from 1,3-buladiene or from I /Mnilyncdio] with meihanol catalysed by basic type catalyst (Kef: Jpn Tokkyo Koho JP (1987) 62 54,778) has been reported.<br>
Hydrolysis and rearrangement of the epoxybutenc which can be obtained by monoepoxidation of 1,3-huiadicnc by various catalysts (Ref: 1) JCS, Chem. Commun. (1992) 1073; 2) Bur. Pat. Appl. EP (1980) 43,192) to 1,4-butenediol has been achieved using various acid catalysts such as SiO2/TiO2/F (Ref; Ger. Of fen DE (1995) 4.429,699), 57% UK)., (Ref: Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho (1979) 79,79,214) KI/H2SO4 (Ref: Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP (1982) 82,02,227), Cubr (Ref: Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho (1979) 79 73,710), copper supported on SiO2 and AlO3, (Ref: US (!996) 5,530,167).<br>
The abovcmenlioncd processes in the prior art are known to be useful for the preparation of 1,4-butenedioi, however they suffer from following drawbacks.<br>
1.	For  the   hydrogcnation of acetylenic diol hydrogen gas (high pressure)   is   used.<br>
Hydrogen   is   a gas of low molecular weight and therefore  high   diffusibility,  is<br>
easily ignited and presents considerable hazards, particularly on the large scale.<br>
2.	The halogenalion method involves the use of stoichiometric amount of CuBr,<br><br>
CuCI lo produce dihalo compounds which are then hydrolysed using basic catalysts to 1,4-butcncdiol. This method obviously involves many steps. It also applies to transestcrification method.<br>
3.	Most  of  the methods reported in the prior art involves   homogeneous   catalysts,<br>
the   separation   of these homogeneous catalysts from the reaction  products  is  a<br>
major drawback.<br>
4.	Oxidation  of   1,3-butadienc to 1,4-butenediol involves   expensive   homogeneous<br>
catalysts  such   as   Pd,   Pt,   Rh etc  with   low  conversion   and  selectivity.    The<br>
oxidation also involves high pressure and temperature.<br>
5.	Hydrolysis   and   rearrnngcment  of epoxybutene,   though   an   attractive   method,<br>
involves   highly   acidic   reagents such as 57% HIO4,   KI/H2SO4   and   dangerous<br>
fluorine gas used in combination with SiO2/TiO2.   The monoepoxidalion of   1,3-<br>
butadiene   to  epoxybutene   is   not easy, involving   high   technology   with   silver<br>
catalyst.<br>
In view of all the above disadvantages of the prior art, it is desirable to provide a process, that is, safe, inexpensive, single step and simple.<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a single step, simple and easier process for the dihydroxylalion of 1,3-butadienc to ;\ mixture of 1,2-,-iind 1,4-butenediols using a heterogeneous catalyst that can be easily separated from the product mixture and reused.<br><br>
The catalyst used in the present invention is prepared by the process described in papers published in Appl. Catal. 57 (1990)L1 and J. Catal. 130, (1991).<br>

oxidising agent and heterogenous catalyst TS-1 (titanium silicate) in the<br>

b)	heating    the    mixture as obtained in step (a) in an autoclave    at a<br>

followed by cooling of the reaction mixture to ambient temperature,<br>
c)	separating of titanium silicate and solvent by known methods to obtain the<br>
mixture of dihydroxy alkenes.<br>

In yet another embodiment the solvent used may be such as but not limited to acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, water and mixture thereof.<br>
