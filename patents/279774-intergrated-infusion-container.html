INTEGRATED INFUSION CONTAINER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a unitary medicine bottle for injection, more particularly, to a unitary medicine bottle having an integral structure where a medicine container is easily connected with a plastic container including a solution at a completely sterilized state so that powdered, freeze-dried or liquid medicine is mixed with the solution with one touch for a short time.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, in order to administer powdered form or lyophilized( powder) form of anticancer medicine or a freeze-dried medicine to a patient in a clinic like a hospital, the powdered medicine included in a container like a vial is mixed with a certain amount of solution like a saline solution and then it is instilled.<br>
For instillation, methods for mixing the powerded medicine with a solution are as follows. First, a solution like a saline solution is injected into a vial with a throwaway syringe to dissolve the powered medicine, and the dissolved solution is transferred to the solution container with the throwaway syringe, also. This method is generally used because it does not need additional equipments, but it is inadvantageous in that impurities may be infiltrated and operations are complicated.<br>
Second, the container including the dissolved medicine is coupled with the container including the solution using a coupling tool such as a double-ended needle or a coupling tube. The container including the dissolved medicine is inclined so that the medicine dissolved in the container is inserted into the container including the solution.<br>
However, the above operations are complicated and time-consuming. In particular, as the operation for perforating a hole for connection on a container including a medicine is carried out in the air, the possibility of contaminating the included medicine is increased. Moreover, the possibility of a nosocomial infection due to an abuse of antibiotic injection is increased, also.<br>
As a method for solving the above problem, a medicine bottle for injection where a capsule receiving a vial being a medicine container is connected with a plastic container filled with a solution having an outlet of a liquid medicine by a tube has been developed.<br>
In the tube, a hollow cavity needle is attached toward the vial and a breaking mated al like a tube made of platic is attached toward the plastic container. The breaking material blocks a passage in the tube for holding a liquid from flowing.<br>
[9]	When using this, the vial in the capsule is pressed and a rubber stopper is pricked<br>
with the cavity needle to connect the plastic container with the vial. The breaking<br>
material is broken with a finger for the passage in the tube to be reopened so that the<br>
medicine is mixed with the solution.<br>
[10]	The more improved one than the above medicine bottle for injection includes a<br>
plastic container having a liquid passage with an enclosure at the uppermost and filled with a solution or a diluted solution in the medicine bottle for injection, a capsule connected with the plastic container, a medicine container connected by pricking its rubber stopper of which the inlet is closed with a needle and which is maintained in the capsule and a flue means for connecting the inside of the plastic container with the inside of the medicine container.<br>
[ 11J	In addition, the flue means includes a hollow cavity needle having a hub in the<br>
middle and blades at both ends, a control means for perforating a stopper of the medicine container by one blade of the cavity needle and an enclosure of the plastic container by the other blade of the cavity needle in a serial order so as to connect the plastic container with the medicine container.<br>
112]	The above described medicine bottle for injection is improved in that a medicine<br>
container is connected with a plastic container including a solution, but a plurality of<br>
operations that the rubber stopper of a vial is pricked by a cavity needle and a breaking<br>
material is broken with a finger to open the passage require quite a long time.<br>
113]	Moreover, when the breaking material is incompletely broken, there occur problems<br>
that the solution is difficult to pass through the passage and a lot of time for dissoving it is required.<br>
[ 14]	The above medicine bottle for injection is considered to be improved in that a<br>
medicine is mixed by connecting a medicine container with a plastic container including a solution, and a shortened time consumed for its operation. However, the medicine bottle for injection has a problem that a flue means needs a hollow osteoplasty needle having a hub in the middle and blades at both ends and a com-plicatedly shaped control means for controling a connecting order so that one blade of the osteoplasty needle pricks the stopper of a medicine container first and the other blade of it pricks the enclosure of the plastic container. In addition, as the medicine bottle for injection consists of a number of parts, a manufacturing costs is high and the possibility of malfuntions is increased.<br>
f 151	In addition, there present various sizes of medicine containers. The conventional<br>
medicine bottles for injection were manufactured in accordance with the size of each medicine container. Therefore, it is inadvantageous in that the manufacuturing cost is increased because a molding die must be manufactured for producing medicine bottle for injections corresponding to the sizes of various medicine containers.<br>
[16]<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[64]	Fig. 1 shows a unitary medicine bottle in accordance with the present invention,<br>
consisting of a plastic container (2), a protecting cap, a releasing member, a flue needle<br>
(11), the protecting cap being inserted by a medicine container (2).<br>
[65]	The medicine container (2) is disclosed and is formed of plastic or glass.<br>
[66]	The medicine container has a neck (7) at which a stopper (10) is formed to seal the<br>
contained medicine.<br>
[67]	Moreover, the stopper (10) is hermetically sealed at the neck (7) of the medicine<br>
container (1) by an aluminum cover (not shown). Accordingly, the medicine filled in<br>
the medicine container (1) is protected at a completely sterilized state.[68]	The stopper (10) is inserted in the packing (8) to be conjugated between the<br>
medicine container (1) and the coupling member (4) in an aseptic condition.<br>
[69]	The stopper (10) is formed of rubber or plastic to have the same shape shown in<br>
Fig. 2. The medicine included in the medicine container is used by pricking the stopper<br>
(10) with an injection needle or a flue needle of a medicine bottle, etc.<br>
[70]	The medicine in the medicine container is in a liquid or powdered state. The<br>
powdered medicine is dissolved to be used.<br>
[71]	The medicine inserted into the medicine container includes cephem series pre-<br>
antibiotics like Cefazolin Sodium, ceftizoxime sodium, Cefotiam HCL etc., penicillin<br>
series antibiotics like Ampicillin Sodium and penicillin soldium etc., carbapenum<br>
series antibiotics like imipenem, various antibiotics like mitomycine C and fluorourcil,<br>
antiulcer agents like Famotidine and hydrochloric acid Ranitidine, a thrombosis<br>
solvent like urokinase and flomoxef sodium.<br>
[72]	The plastic container (2) is a synthetic resin pack used to contain a solution (3) like<br>
saline solution and may be formed of a material with affluent plasticity such as a low density polyethylene resin, a linear low density polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, soft polyethylene resin, chlorinated polyethylene resin, chlorinated vinyl resin and ethylene acetic acid vinyl copolymer.<br>
(73]	It is preferable to use a polyolefin series resin like a low density polyethylene resin,<br>
a linear low density polyethylene resin and polypropylene resin because they are chemical resistant, has small effluents and cost-effective.<br>
[74]	The solutions to be contained in the plastic container (2) include solution including<br>
various electrolytes besides a saline solution, 5% dextrose solution and distilled water for injection.<br>
[75]	As shown in Fig. 3, the plastic container (2) is equipped with a coupling member<br>
(4) connected with the medicine container (1) at one end and a releasing member (12)<br>
for releasing the liquid medicine to be injected at the other end.<br>
[76]	The coupling member (4) and the releasing member (12) are attached to the plastic<br>
container (2) by a thermal fusion so that the solution is not leaked.<br>
[77]	As shown in Fig. 4, the coupling member (4) comprises a guide section (14) for<br>
guiding the flue needle (11) and a diaphragm (9) for supporting a stopper (10) of the medicine container (1).<br>
[78]	In addition, a flange (22) formed at the side of the coupling member (4) is used<br>
together with the seats of the flue needle (11) with the same method as injecting a<br>
liquid medicine. In other words, the flue needle (11) is pushed upward by pressing the<br>
seats with a thumb and placing an index finger and a middle finger on the flange (22).<br>
[79]	A pipe is formed inside the coupling member (4) so that the flue needle (11) can<br>
make linear movements and an annular conjugation protuberance (25) is formed at an<br>
outer end so that the packing (8) is integrally sealed with the coupling member (4).<br>
[80]	The diaphragm (9) of the coupling member (4) is formed in a dome to be closely<br>
adhered to a central portion of the stopper (10) of the medicine container (1).<br>
[81]	Moreover, the diaphragm (9) has a thin layer which is easily perforated by the flue<br>
needle (11). If it is blocked, it plays a role in sealing the plastic container (2).<br>
[82]	In addition, a stopper (15) is formed at the bottom of the coupling member (4) to<br>
play a role in limiting a vertical movement distance of the flue needle (11).<br>
[83]	The flue needle (11) inserted in the coupling member (4) is a cavity needle with at<br>
least one passageway through which a liquid medicine flows, having the similar shape to a general injection syringe. The flue needle (11) has a seat which is pressed by a finger at one end. The flue needle (11) has a fixing protuberance (24) so that the flue needle (11) is not easily displaced from the initial state and an interrupting protuberance (23) at one side so that the flue needle (11) is stopped at a predetermined position inside the coupling member (4) and not to be displaced further.[84]	Accordingly, if the flue needle (11) is not applied by an external force from the<br>
fixing protuberance (24) at the initial state, it is not displaced. If the flue needle (11) is applied by an external force, it is moved toward the diaphragm (9) along with the guide section (14) and disaplced by a predetermined distance and is stopped by the interrupting protuberance (23) and/or the stopper (15).<br>
[85]	Therefore, the flue needle (11) moves forward and pricks the stopper (10) of the<br>
medicine container (1) and plays a role in connecting the inside of the medicine container (1) with the inside of the plastic container (2), maintaining the state that the stopper is perforated.<br>
[86]	The releasing member (12) consists of an outlet (21) which is closely attached with<br>
the plastic container (2) so that a liquid medicine is not leaked, a releasing extended rim (16) which is mounted inside an end of the outlet (21), a releasing cap (20) for exposing only the center of the releasing extended rim (16) by covering one end of the outlet (20) and a cover seal (19) attached to the outside of the releasing cap (20) to seal the releasing extended rim (16).<br>
[87]	The outlet (21) is thermally fused with the plastic container (2) to be sealed. The<br>
releasing extended rim (16) made of a rubber, etc. (shown in Fig. 6) is forced to place inside of the outlet (21).<br>
[88]	The cover seal (19) is attached to the outside of the releasing cap (20) by a thermal<br>
fusion or a supersonic fusion. Therefore, the medicine bottle for injection according to the present invention can be sealed at an asceptic state by attaching the cover seal (19). The protection cap is integrally formed with the coupling member (4) to include a medicine container (1).<br>
[89]	Especially, as shown in Fig. 6, the protection cap includes a fixing cap (5) integrally<br>
formed with the coupling member (4), a moving cap (6) which is interpolated or extrapolated in the fixing cap (5) to change the interal space, and a moving flange (18) which is integrally connected with the fixing flange (17) formed at one end of the fixing cap (5) and fixed to the moving cap (6) to set a space formed by the moving cap (6) and the fixing cap (5).<br>
[90]	The connection with the moving flange (18) and the fixing flange (17) and the<br>
connection with the moving flange (18) and the moving cap (6) are carried out by a thermal fusion or a supersonic fusion.<br>
[91]	The size of the internal space formed by the moving cap (6) and the fixing cap (5) is<br>
not limited, thus all sizes of medicine container (1) can use it.<br>
[92]	The medicine container (1) mounted in the internal space formed by the moving cap<br>
(6) and the fixing cap (5) is protected from the external impact. The medicine container (1) is mounted with the stopper (10) inserted in the packing (8) mounted inside the fixing cap (5), upside down.<br>
 <br>
[93]	As shown in Fig. 7, the packing (8) is formed to wrap the stopper (10) and has a<br>
hole in the center so that the diaphragm (9) of the coupling member (4) is inserted.<br>
[94]	The fixing cap (5) and the moving cap (6) are formed of a polyolefin series resin, a<br>
stylene series resin, an acryl series resin, a polycarbonate resin, polyamide resin, etc.<br>
[95]	The fixing cap (5) and the moving cap (6) can sterilze their insides easily by a k-ray<br>
and a ultraviolet ray or a peroxide processing, using a polypropylene resin which relatively penetrates an ultraviolet ray and a methylpentine resin.<br>
[96]	A hanging means (13) has a hook or a hanging hole formed at the upper side of the<br>
moving cap (6), thus an unitary medicine bottle according to the present invention is hung on a hanger to be stably kept.<br>
[97]	The operating methods according to the present invention now will be described.<br>
[98]	First, the flue needle (11) is moved vertically from the outside of the plastic<br>
container (2) shown in Fig. 8 by pressing it toward the diaphragm (9) of the coupling<br>
member (4), as shown in Fig. 9<br>
[99]	The front end of the flue needle (11) is guided to the guide section (14) to penetrate<br>
the diaphragm (9) of the coupling member (4).<br>
[ 100]	As the front end of the penetrated flue needle (11) penetrates the stopper (10) of the<br>
medicine container (1) and the flue needle (11) goes inside the medicine container (1), the inside of the medicine container (1) and the inside of the plastic container (2) are connected by a flue needle being a cavity needle.<br>
[101]	After the inside of medicine container (1) in connected with the inside of the plastic<br>
container (2), the plastic container (2) is pressurized with both hands slightly to send a<br>
part of solution into the medicine container (1), thus dissolving the medicine.<br>
[ 102]	In addition, a unitary medicine bottle for injection is shaken a few times so that the<br>
medicine in the medicine container (1) is dissolved fast.<br>
[103]	Next, the liquid medicine dissolved in the medicine container (1) is returned back to<br>
the plastic container (2) by the operations of pressurizing or pressing the plastic<br>
container (2). The liquid medicine including the liquid medicine and the solution (3)<br>
which are mixed in the plastic container (2) is released from the releasing means (12)<br>
attached at one end of the plastic container (2). At this time, the cover seal (19) is<br>
removed from the releasing cap (20) and a set of medicine bottle for injection is<br>
coupled to the releasing extended rim (16), thus a liquid medicine is instilled.<br>
