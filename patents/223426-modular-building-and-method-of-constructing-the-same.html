				<td>MODULAR BUILDING AND METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING THE SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a modular building and to a method of<br>
constructing the same, particularly modular buildings which are suited to<br>
withstand earthquakes and high winds.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to structural elements for use in the<br>
construction of modular buildings and particularly to panels and wall sections for<br>
such buildings. The invention further relates to materials for use in the<br>
construction of the buildings.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The humanitarian and economic impact of natural disasters such as earthquakes<br>
and extreme adverse weather conditions such as high winds is becoming an<br>
increasing concern to many nations, the recent devastation in Central America<br>
being a particular example. Apart from the damage caused to structures, such as<br>
bridges and buildings being extremely expensive to repair, the danger to human<br>
life brought about by the collapse of such structures means that stronger<br>
materials and better methods of construction are increasingly need to be used.<br>
Unfortunately, however, many of the areas frequently affected by<br>
natural disasters are often poor and the costs of materials and<br>
improved construction is usually prohibitive. Furthermore, the quantity<br>
of raw materials necessary to produce the volume of<br>
housing required, could cause a negative impact on the environment,<br>
firstly due to the depletion of the raw materials and secondly due to the method of<br>
production of the final material which method can be energy intensive. Moreover,<br>
a primary consideration following a large scale disaster is that any new buildings<br>
erected, should be erected as rapidly as possible. Again, with conventional<br>
materials of construction this is not usually done as rapidly as desired, which<br>
increases the misery and suffering of the victims. It is also worthy of<br>
consideration that, following a large disaster, there will most likely be insufficient<br>
skilled labour available to carry out the construction required. There is therefore a<br>
need for the rapid deployment of the means to facilitate the construction of<br>
buildings which can be constructed using predominantly unskilled labour.<br>
A further and more general problem when constructing a large number of<br>
buildings is the provision, at the construction site of the elements needed to carry<br>
out the building work. This includes, typically, not just brick, steel, sand or wood<br>
for example, but also the means for producing concrete, mortar and correctly<br>
forming walls, window frames to the correct size. Such preparation of materials<br>
requires a great deal of time which is not always desirable either from an<br>
economic or a humanitarian standpoint. Furthermore, commonly used materials,<br>
particularly steel and wood are prone to degradation such as rusting or rot. Wood<br>
also can be subject to insect and mould attack which reduces its mechanical<br>
strength.<br>
It is therefore desirable to develop new materials from which the constructional<br>
elements of a house such as the walls and roof can be made. Such new materials<br>
must be durable and also able to withstand extremes of wind and temperature.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide low cost and easily constructable<br>
modular housing which is capable of withstanding extreme weather conditions or<br>
even earthquakes.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to utilise available materials to provide<br>
composite materials for use in the construction of modular housing which can be<br>
produced at minimal impact to the environment.<br>
It is a yet further object of the invention to provide constructional elements which<br>
can be rapidly formed and deployed when constructing a building.<br>

According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a modular<br>
building comprising:<br>
a foundation floor having secured therein a plurality of anchor elements ;<br>
a plurality of wall-retaining track elements adapted to engage wall panels<br>
of the building, the track elements being securable to the foundation floor so as<br>
to define the position of at least the load bearing walls of the building ;<br>
wall panels locatable with respect to the track elements, the internal<br>
material of the panel defining at least one channel or duct formed within the<br>
panel, parallel to a longitudinal axis thereof and at least one channel or duct<br>
formed therein disposed perpendicularly to and laterally of the longitudinal axis ;<br>
and<br>
a plurality of securing members adapted to pass through and locatable<br>
within said channels or ducts, the securing members being anchored at each<br>
end thereof so as to maintain the panels in fixed relationship to one another.<br>
The building further comprises a roof structure formed from a plurality of roof<br>
panels, each panel including at least one channel or duct formed therein parallel<br>
to the longitudinal axis thereof and at least one channel or duct formed therein<br>
disposed perpendicularly to and laterally of the longitudinal axis.<br>
The roof panels are secured to a roof beam utilising a plurality of securing<br>
members which are adapted to pass through and be locatable within said<br>
channels or ducts, the securing members being anchored at each end thereof so<br>
as to secure the panels irrfixed relationship to one another and the roof beam.<br>
Advantageously, the security members comprise rods or cables having high<br>
tensile strength characteristics while maintaining flexibility.<br>
In one arrangement the securing members include a threaded sleeve element at<br>
one or both ends thereof for receiving a securing bolt. The securing members<br>
comprise glass-fibre strands bonded together with the strands in parallel<br>
alignment. Additionally, the securing members are coated with a plastics material<br>
such as polypropylene to increase abrasion resistance.<br>
The securing members are positioned and tensioned so as to form a net-like<br>
structure to resist panel movement.<br>
The wall-retaining members are conveniently bondable to the foundation floor by<br>
means of a mastic sealant. The or each tracking member may additionally be<br>
secured by means of one or more connection bolts.<br>
The wall panels advantageously comprise grooves to receive the securing<br>
members. The wall panels may additionally comprise one or more ducts or<br>
channels to receive electric wires or a plumbing system. The wall panels may<br>
additionally comprise apertures to receive floor and window cartridge units. A<br>
sealant may be provided between adjacent wall panels to give increased strength<br>
and water resistance.<br>
A building as so formed is highly wind resistant, and the materials from which it<br>
is formed are resistant to for example heat, rain, mildew and insects.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a construction<br>
element such as a wall or roof panel for a modular building, the construction<br>
element comprising a composite material utilising silica cenospheres and a resin.<br>
The wall or roof panels have bonded to and across at least part of its surface, a<br>
second composite material, the second composite material comprising a number<br>
of layers; including a first inner nylon layer and a second outer nylon layer, a<br>
glass fibre mat layer between the first and second nylon layers: and a polymer<br>
resin distributed between the nylon layers to bond the nylon layers together.<br>
The thickness of the nylon layers is preferably between 17-21 µm, so that the<br>
nylon layers neither tears too easily during processing nor distorts during<br>
processing. A value of 19µm has been found to be particularly preferable.<br>
The resin is preferably present at a level of 30-50% w/w of the second composite<br>
material and particularly preferably at a level of 20% w/vv. The resin can be<br>
selected from one or more of the following classes of polymeric compounds,<br>
polyester, polyurethane, polyacrylic, polyphenolic, polybromophenolic,<br>
polyvinylester or an epoxy resin, or mixtures thereof.<br>
A fire retardant material is preferably included between the nylon layers. The fire<br>
retardant material is preferably aluminium trioxide which can absorb heat well,<br>
and disperse the path of a flame or heat through the second composite material.<br>
The aluminium trioxide is advantageously present at a level of 15-50% w/w with<br>
respect to the resin. The level is preferably from 30-40% w/w, and particularly<br>
preferably approximately 35% w/w. Optionally, the fire retardant material can<br>
comprise glass flakes. In a further alternative, a fire retardant chemical such as<br>
polyhalogenated phenols, for example bromophenols can be included.<br>
The second composite material advantageously includes a glass-tissue layer<br>
having a density of 14-30g/m2, to reduce uneven features being introduced to the<br>
surface of the second composite material.<br>
The second composite material includes a colouring agent such as titanium<br>
dioxide to improve its appearance. The surface of the second composite material<br>
can be altered by means of an electric current passed across the surface, the<br>
surface structure then being enabled to receive, for example, paint or varnish.<br>
There is also provided a method of constructing a building comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
preparing a ground area on which the building is to stand to receive a<br>
foundation floor:<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1, the concrete foundation slab 10, has secured therein<br>
a vertical rod 11 to provide an anchor for securing cables. The vertical rod 11 is<br>
attached at a lower end to a ground anchor 12.<br>
Figure 2 shows a wall retaining member 20, secured to a foundation slab 21 by a<br>
connection bolt 22. A layer of mastic 23 forms a waterproof sealant between the<br>
wall retaining member 20 and the foundation slab 21. Figure 3 shows the wall<br>
panels 30, 31, 32 fixed in position on the wall retaining member 33 to form part of<br>
an outer wall 34 and an internal wall 35. The panels abut a box beam 36. In<br>
Figure 4, the horizontal cables 40, 41 can be seen in more detail. In use, these<br>
cables anchor the wall panels 42, 43, 44 in position. Vertical cables 50 are held in<br>
position at the anchor point 51. The anchor point 51 is attached to the vertical rod<br>
52 which is set into the concrete of the foundation slab 53 as shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 shows the top of the wall panel 60 with a top wall track 61 fixed into<br>
position. The top wall track 61 is fixed into position by means of a connecting bolt<br>
62 secured and tensioned by a vertical flexible fibre cable 63. Where the wall<br>
panel is to be part of the central wall of the building, an additional ridge beam 70<br>
may also be secured into position as shown in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a joint between a wall panel 80 and a roof panel 81. A top<br>
wall track 82 is fitted to the top of the wall panel 80 and secured in position by a<br>
connection bolt 83, attached to securing cable 84. The roof panel 81 is secured by<br>
means of a horizontal fibre cable 85, and further horizontal cables 86.<br>
The roof panel 81 incorporates a built-in gutter 87 which is connected to a piping<br>
system leading to a storage tank (not illustrated). The rain-water collected by this<br>
gutter and piping system can be employed for non-potable uses such as watering<br>
crops. Once the roof panel 81 and piping system is in place, a soffit panel 88 and<br>
fascia panels may be positioned in place.<br>
A wall panel 90, suitable for use in assembling the above buildings as shown in<br>
Figure 9. The wall panel 90 is generally rectangular cuboidal in shape. It<br>
comprises grooves 91 A, 91B which in use receive vertical fibre cables. The wall<br>
panel 90 also comprises apertures 92A, 92B, 92C leading into internal panels<br>
across the width of the wall panel to receive horizontal securing cables 93A, 93B,<br>
93C.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show a roof panel 110 having a tile-effect outer surface. The<br>
roof panel 110 comprises an inner core 111 formed from the same composite<br>
material as is used for the wall panel 90. The roof panel 110 comprises a number<br>
of channels 112 within the inner core 111 to receive horizontal securing cables<br>
113.<br>
Figures 12-15 show a bobbin 130 used to secure the flexible cables in position.<br>
The bobbin 130 comprises an outer wall 131 defining a cable-receiving cavity<br>
132. One end of the cable-receiving cavity 132 is tapered. The angle of taper with<br>
respect to the longitudinal axis of the bobbin 130 being 15 degrees.<br>
Figure 16 shows a collet 170, which in use fits within the tapered portion of the<br>
cavity 132. The collet 170 has an outer sheath 171 surrounding an inner core 172.<br>
The inner core 172 has a substantially V-shaped cross-section. The outer surface<br>
of the inner core 172 has a stepped configuration enabling it to grip the outer<br>
sheath 171. The angle subtended by the inner walls of the inner core 172 is 15°.<br>
The angle subtended by the walls of the outer sheath 171 is 30°.<br>
The inner surface of the collet 170, as shown in Figures 18 and 18a also has a<br>
stepped configuration to enable it to grip the securing cables. Figure 19 illustrates<br>
the interaction between the collet 170 and the cable 200. as the collet 170 is<br>
moved in the direction shown by arrow A. As the collet 170 is inserted in to the<br>
bobbin 130 the collet portions are squeezed together to grip the cable 200.<br>
In use, once the collet and bobbin are in position around the cable, the bobbin 130<br>
is twisted which causes the cable to be gripped more tightly thus securing the<br>
cables and retaining the wall or roof panels in position. When used in this manner<br>
collet and bobbin act as a connecting bolt.<br>
When constructing a building as described above, the ground is first prepared to a<br>
suitable state to receive the building. A concrete foundation slab is formed by<br>
pouring into place a cementatious material. Vertical rods which have been placed<br>
in the concrete at distances of approximately 1.3m from one another along the<br>
eventual position of the perimeter and centre wall provide connections at the<br>
bottom for the connection to ground anchors, and at the top of the finished<br>
concrete foundation slab for connection to the vertical flexible fibre cable system.<br>
Wall-retaining members having a U-shaped cross-section for the perimeter and<br>
centre walls are positioned onto the foundation slab. A bed of mastic sealant is<br>
added between the wall retaining member and the foundation slab in order to<br>
improve the water proofing properties and a connection bolt used to secure the<br>
wall-retaining members to the floor slab. At the intersection of the rear and centre<br>
walls, wall panels are set in place in a T-configuration. A vertical box beam is<br>
attached at the centre of the T-junction and horizontal flexible fibre cables are<br>
threaded through the wall panels. As each wall panel is put into place a vertical<br>
flexible fibre cable is connected at the floor and threaded through an alignment<br>
tube pushed into a vertical grove in the edge of the wall panel. The alignment tube<br>
has dimensions of approximately 5cm by 5cm.<br>
The horizontal flexible fibre cables are tensioned and locked using a cable clamp,<br>
thus holding each wall panel precisely in position. The procedure is continued<br>
until all the wall panels including any door frames and window wall panels are in<br>
place and tensioned.<br>
When all the wall panels are in position, a top wall-retainer is put on top of each<br>
wall. Additionally, a ridge beam is placed on top of the centre wall. The vertical<br>
flexible fibre cables are then tensioned and locked using a cable clamp. The<br>
structure is ready to receive roof panels.<br>
Starting from one end of the building a first roof panel is set onto the wall and<br>
ridge beam. Horizontal flexible fibre cables are threaded through the roof panel<br>
and attached in position. A spacer tube is placed into the grooved edge of the roof<br>
panel and a sealant applied. The next roof panel is slid into place and the flexible<br>
fibre cables tensioned and locked. Any excess sealant is squeezed out between the<br>
joint between the two roof panels and can be simply removed. The sealant is<br>
normally the same colour as the panel to give an impression of there being no<br>
joints present. The roof panels are subsequently anchored to the foundation slab<br>
and to the ground anchors.<br>
Door and window cartridge units are then snapped into position in the appropriate<br>
apertures within the wall and wall panels and secured.<br>
As described, the building is easy to construct as many of the individual elements<br>
are pre-formed and need only to be fitted together. The building is also<br>
structurally reinforced with a comprehensive network of cables throughout the<br>
entire structure which are anchored to the ground through a concrete slab<br>
foundation. In this manner the buildings are able to withstand even hurricane<br>
force winds. In addition, the construction and materials from which the wall<br>
panels are formed mean that the building as a whole has superior thermal and<br>
sound insulation. In addition it is also resistant to mildew and insect damage, as<br>
well as being extremely fire resistant. Furthermore the building does not require a<br>
great deal of maintenance and is durable and long lasting.<br>
The glass beads from which the core material for the wall panels is made can be<br>
formed from recycled glass thus reducing the environmental load of materials<br>
used in the construction of the building.<br>
In a further embodiment, not illustrated, the ground anchors and vertical rods are<br>
not required, and the wall panels are secured to the floor by passing the securing<br>
members through the hollow tubes within the foundation floor. The fibre cables<br>
can be flexible or stiff according to the use to which they are put<br>
Due to the modular nature of the buildings, the individual elements can be<br>
transported from one central location to the required site and because of the flat<br>
nature of the wall panels, the materials needed for the building can occupy a small<br>
space within the particular vehicle being used for transportation. Moreover, once<br>
the materials have reached the proposed location of the building, the building can<br>
be assembled using a relatively unskilled workforce which again assists the rapid<br>
construction of the building, particularly useful following a natural disaster.<br>
A composite material, which is suitable for use in the construction of building is<br>
formed as follows. A bonding material, often referred to as bonding slip, is<br>
prepared by the dissolution of water glass (sodium silicate) in water, until the<br>
water glass solution has a sodium oxide content of 40% w/w. A blowing agent,<br>
sodium nitrate (6% w/w of the water glass concentration) is dissolved in the water<br>
glass solution and the solution produced thereby, heated to a temperature of 80C.<br>
The solution is maintained at 80C for a period of time in order to allow excess<br>
water to evaporate. Care must be taken that the temperature does not greatly<br>
exceed 80C as this leads to the water vapour being removed too quickly, and to<br>
decomposition of the sodium nitrate. Water is removed until the sodium<br>
silicate/sodium nitrate-containing solution has a viscosity of from 1.5 - 2.0 poise.<br>
Silica powder, having an average particle size of 300µ - with 60% of the particles<br>
having a particle size of from 270 - 330µ - is fed onto a granulating tray. The<br>
particle size of the silica powder is important. Too high a percentage of fines<br>
requires, in subsequent steps, more filler resin and can also clog up the mixer.<br>
Too high a percentage of coarse material reduces the production of cenospheres.<br>
The bonding slip — i.e. the above described solution of water glass and sodium<br>
nitrate - is sprayed onto the silica powder through an oscillating arm positioned<br>
above the granulating tray. When the correct amount of bonding slip has been<br>
added the glass powder begins to form an agglomerate with the bonding slip and<br>
the surface tension within the agglomerate forms it into small beads. As the<br>
bonding slip interacts with the silica powder the viscosity of the fluid gradually<br>
increases. The particles of the silica powder gradually increase in size primarily<br>
due to hydration, reaching about 400-500u. When the viscosity of the fluid is<br>
high enough, (approximated to the viscosity of putty or plasticine) the<br>
agglomerate is extruded through holes in the granulating tray and cut into pre-<br>
blown granules.<br>
The pre-blown granules then enter a rotating kiln heated to a temperature of 750C,<br>
the rotary action of the rotary kiln forming the pre-blown granules into spherical<br>
beads. When, due to the heating action of the rotary kiln, the beads reach a<br>
temperature of approximately 650C the sodium nitrate begins to decompose<br>
producing a gas (NOX). The pressure of the gas forms the internal volume of the<br>
beads into a foam like structure, which structure is maintained upon drying the<br>
bead, forming what is often referred to as a cenosphere.<br>
Using the above process, cenospheres of different sizes may be produced by<br>
employing different sized meshes during extrusion of the pellets. Typical values<br>
for the size of the cenospheres are 0.5mm-8.0mm. During the drying process,<br>
care should be taken that the temperature in the kiln does not exceed 800C, as the<br>
sodium nitrate consequently decomposes too quickly. The temperature of the kiln<br>
should also be above 700C in order that the cenospheres formed are of a<br>
satisfactory quality. As an alternative or as an additional blowing agent to sodium<br>
nitrate, soda/urea/hydrogen peroxide or soda lye/manganese IV oxide/sugar or a<br>
suitable mixture thereof can be used.<br>
Wall and roof panels, having a composite structure and which can be used, for<br>
example, in the construction of housing are produced as follows. Cenospheres<br>
formed of an expanded silica and produced by the above process are mixed with<br>
an epoxy resin monomer bonding material. The size distribution of the silica<br>
cenospheres is a ratio from, by weight, of 3:2:1 for beads having a particle size of<br>
2:1: ~ 0.5mm. The distribution of sizes enables an efficient close packing of the<br>
cenospheres, within the eventually formed panel and requires the minimal amount<br>
of resin. The close packing moreover contributes to the strength of the panel and<br>
reduces possible warping during polymerisation of the resin monomer and during<br>
use. A typical value for the weight ratio of silica cenospheres to resin is 95:5.<br>
As the density of the beads is 0.7-0.8g/cm3 and that of the resin is far denser, often<br>
in the region of l.lg/cm3. care must be taken that the viscosity of the resin is<br>
sufficiently high in order to slow down the rate at which the beads float to the top<br>
of the resin. When the cenospheres and the resin monomer have been thoroughly<br>
mixed together, a polymerisation catalyst, hexamine, at a level of 5-6% w/w of the<br>
resin monomer is added. Once the mixture has reached a viscosity of 30-50 poise,<br>
preferably 40 poise, the mixture is poured into a mould to cure and harden. The<br>
temperature at which the curing process takes place is ambient temperature. The<br>
mould can include a number of PVC tubes which pass through the body of<br>
eventually formed block. The tubes result in the presence of channels through the<br>
block, which channels facilitate the passage of cables used during the construction<br>
of a building.<br>
In order to assist the maintenance of an even distribution of the cenospheres<br>
throughout the resin, the mould has vibrating means to vibrate the mixture.<br>
Typically the vibrating means are located 1/3 and 2/3 of the way along the length<br>
of the mould. A vacuum pump can be used to draw the mixture down the mould<br>
and reduce any residual air pockets. After curing, which typically requires about<br>
an hour, the hardened core material is removed from the mould.<br>
As an alternative, or. where applicable, in combination with the polyester<br>
monomer above, a vinyl ester or an unsaturated polyester can be used. Vinyl<br>
esters are preferred as they improve the fire resistance characteristics of the<br>
material produced. The catalyst for the vinyl ester or unsaturated polyester<br>
polymerisation is methylethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). The MEKP is normally<br>
used at a level of 2% w/w of the resin monomer. The MEKP can be absorbed<br>
onto a support such as bentonite, or other clay material. When using bentonite,<br>
the catalyst is mixed in more slowly than is normally the case in order to reduce<br>
damage to the bentonite particles. During the polymerisation process, ultrasound<br>
is used to break apart the bentonite and release the MEKP into the mixture which<br>
commences polymerisation. By absorbing the catalyst therefore, the onset of<br>
polymerisation can be delayed.<br>
As shown in Figure 20 a wall panel 210 comprises a central core 211. The central<br>
core 211 is a composite material comprising expanded glass beads bound together<br>
by a polyester resin. The wall panel 210 further comprises a skin 212. and a<br>
channel 213 along which a cable can pass. The skin is also a composite material<br>
comprising 35% v/v aluminium oxide trihydrate and approximately 65% v/v<br>
polymeric resin.<br>
Alternatively, the core material is formed by pouring the precursor mixture of<br>
resin monomer into a forming tray. Once polymerisation has taken place, the<br>
block of core material thus formed is cut up to the appropriate size. The outer<br>
skin is then bonded to the core material using a bonding paste.<br>
As an alternative to using the above resins, the resin may be selected from one or<br>
more of the following classes of polymeric compounds, polyurethane, polyacrylic,<br>
polyphenolic, polybromophenolic, polyvinylester or an epoxy resin.<br>
Wall panels for use in, for example, the construction of a building are formed as<br>
follows. An inner core material, for example a composite form from resin bound<br>
glass beads is shaped in the form of a rectangular block or other desired shape. In<br>
order to improve the aesthetic, constructional and safety characteristics of the<br>
block, a skin is overlaid on one or both of the in use inner and outer surfaces of<br>
the block. The skin is often formed separately from the block and bonded<br>
subsequently to the block.<br>
The skin is formed as follows, with reference to Figure 21. A moving bed 220 of<br>
a skin forming machine, moves at approximately walking pace. A nylon sheet<br>
221 is unfurled from a roller 222 and laid flat onto the bed 220. As the bed 220<br>
moves, a resin dispenser 223 dispenses resin - in respect of which the nylon sheet<br>
221 is impermeable - onto the surface of the sheet 221. A glass fibre mat 224 is<br>
unfurled from the roller 225 and overlaid over the nylon sheet 221. The glass<br>
fibre mat 224 incorporates chopped glass strands and is permeable to the applied<br>
resin. A further nylon sheet 226 is unfurled from a roller 227 and overlaid over<br>
the glass fibre mat 224 to form a layered pre-sheet. The layered pre-sheet passes<br>
through the compression rollers 228 which compress the layers together and<br>
ensure that the resin is spread out sufficiently to bond the sheets 221, 224, 226<br>
together. Overall, the resin is present in the finished skin at a level of 15-30%<br>
w/w, although a level of 20% w/w has been found to be ideal. The sheet then<br>
passes to a curing region in which the resin is polymerised, bonding the sheets<br>
together to form a uniform structure. The skin produced thereby can be either cut<br>
into lengths or rolled up and transported or stored.<br>
The nylon sheets 221,226 employed are betv/een 17-21µ in thickness, although<br>
the thickness of 19µ has been found to give optimum performance. Above 19u,<br>
the nylon sheets can distort, particularly during rolling and curing, which gives the<br>
skin a poor profile.<br>
The method of polymerisation used depends upon the resin used to bond the<br>
sheets together, but is typically either achieved through the use of heat or by<br>
irradiation with ultra-violet radiation. The length of the curing (polymerisation)<br>
station is typically approximately 12m, to enable the temperature and/or radiation<br>
level to be set to give the optimum polymerisation.<br>
In addition to the layers described above, a number of the other features can also<br>
be included. A gel coat incorporating a colouring agent can be incorporated. A<br>
gel coat can be distributed over the nylon sheet 221, prior to the addition of the<br>
bonding resin from the resin dispenser 223. The colouring agent is added as part<br>
of the gel coat and can be, for example, titanium dioxide, which in the finished<br>
sheet imparts a white colour to the skin and eventually to the finished panel.<br>
A further sheet of glass tissue (having a density of 14-30g/m2) may also be, during<br>
the production, overlaid onto the nylon mat 121. The glass tissue minimises the<br>
risk of surface features from the individual sheets being imparted to the finally<br>
produced skin.<br>
A fire-retardant filler can also be included in the skin, by the incorporation of a<br>
fire-retardant material into the resin dispenser 223. One example of a fire-<br>
retardant material is aluminium oxide, having a mean particle size of less than<br>
0.25µ and ideally a mean particle size of less than 10µ. The smaller size enables<br>
the fire-retardant material to pack more efficiently. The aluminium oxide fire-<br>
retardant material is typically present at a level of 15-50% w/w of the resin. A<br>
level of 30-40% has been found to be particularly suitable, and 35% w/w<br>
especially suitable. The level should be sufficient to impart adequate fire<br>
retardant properties to the skin produced. However, above a level of 50% w/w the<br>
aluminium oxide causes the viscosity of the resin to be too high.<br>
As an alternative, or in addition to aluminium oxide, a number of other fire<br>
retardant materials can be used. For example glass flake can be used. Chemicals,<br>
which are at least partially soluble in the resin can also be employed such as<br>
polyhalogenated phenols, for example polybromophenols.<br>
The glass fibre mat 224 can be obtained either incorporating pre-chopped strands<br>
or with the strands in tact. In the latter case, the mat 224 ideally first undergoes a<br>
chopping process which breaks the strands into small pieces. A typical density for<br>
the glass fibre mat 224 is from 280-320g/m2. A value of approximately 300g/m2<br>
has been found to be particularly beneficial, imparting some rigidity into the<br>
finished skin.<br>
The finished skin can be added, by the use of a suitable resin both to a pre-formed<br>
composite block or other suitable core material. Alternatively, the skin can be<br>
incorporated into a mould in which a block has been formed, in which case the<br>
core material can bond directly to the skin during the core materials production.<br>
The skin can also be corona treated, whereby an electric current is passed across<br>
its outer surface. A corona treatment modifies the overall structure of the outer<br>
surface and enables the surface to receive, for example, paint or varnish.<br>
The wall panel formed by the above process is highly durable and resistant to<br>
attack by water, fire and insects such as termites common to those areas which<br>
also suffer from extreme weather conditions.<br>
It will of course be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific<br>
details described herein, which are given by way of example only, and that<br>
various modifications and alterations are possible within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
