				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved method for the extraction of tungsten. The present invention particularly relates to the extraction of _W from tungsten bearing matrices such as scheelite and wolframite ores. The method more particularly relates to the extraction of pure tungsten (&gt; 99%) the from of W(VI) by using a mixture of bis (2,4,4-tri-<br>
methylpentyl)octylphosphine oxide and tris(2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl)phosphine oxide (85:15, w/w) (I).<br>
Tungsten is one of the strategic high tech metals and used in electriclamps, electronics and other electrical devies. It is also used for cutting, mining and drilling tools, dies and armourpiercing projetiles. As a result of its wide spread use there is a need to develop efficient extraction procedures. Methods involving solvent extraction have certain advantages in comparison to the conventional methods with respect to better purity control, automation and capability to handle low grade ores.<br>
Reference may be made to some organophosphorus extractants di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric and tri-n-butyl phosphate [V.G. Maiorov, E.V. Shevyreva, A.I. Nikolaev, L.I. Medvedeva and V.K. Kopkov, Zh. Prikl. Khim., 81(2), 320 (1989); A.A. Plant, V.A. Reznichenko and L.G. Panfilova, Zh. Neorg. Khim. 22(12), 337 (1977); R.K. Biswas, Bangladesh J. Sci. Ind. Res., 20(1-4), 11(1985); A.N. Zelikman, G.M. Voldman and Y.M. Konyukhov, Khimiya Ekstraktsii, Novosibirsk, 226 (1984) and T. Sato and K. Saka, Hydrometallurgy, 37(3), 253 (1995)] Which have been used for mainly the separation of W from Mo only. Reference may also be<br><br>
made to an alkylphosphine extractant, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (T.Sato, T. Takayanagi and T. Nakamura, Proc. Sym. Solvent Extr. Hamamatsu (Japan), 1(1983) which has been put to some very limited use for the extraction of tungsten. This could be due to the fact that tri-n-octylphosphine oxide is more or less projected as an universal extractant and attaining selectivity is a problem particularly when used singly. Extractant (I) not only quantitatively extracts tungsten but under certain aqueous and organic phase conditions is selective for W(VI) over many commonly associated metal ions. Because of poor aqueous solubility of the extractant (I) it exhibits good recycling capacity.<br>
The main object of the present invention for the extraction of tungsten is to provide a procedure for the separation W(VT) in the presence of commonly associated metal ions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the separation of W from tungsten bearing matrices such as scheelite and wolframite ores.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for the extraction of tungsten using extractant such as (I).<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to use extractant which enables separation of W(VI) from Mo(VI), Si(IV), Al(III), Fe(III), As(III), Ca(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), and Na(I).<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein there is negligible loss of the extractant in each extraction-stripping cycle  resulting  in an  economical<br><br>
process.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to extract W from the extractant phase in a form so that it can be easily processed for subsequent applications.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved method for the extraction of tungsten which comprises fusion of tungsten bearing matrix with strong alkali, leaching the fused mass with water and filtering adding acid till the acid molarity is reached upto 5M equilibrating with equal volume of organic solvent, extracting tungsten selectivity in an extractant such as a mixture of bis (2,4,4 -trimethylpentyl) octylphosphine oxide and Bis (2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl) phosphine oxide (85 : 15 w/w) in an organic solvent to obtain tungsten in the organic phase, followed by stripping of tungsten from the organic phase by known methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the tungsten matrix used may be tungsten ore such as scheelite and wolframite.<br>
In another embodiment the mineral acid used may be hydrochloric or sulphuric acid.<br>
In  another  embodiment the diluent used  may  be  n-hexane, 0 kerosene (160-200 C), toluene, cyclohexanone and nitrobenzene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the known<br>
method  used  for striping tungsten may use  reagents  such  1-5%<br>
NH C1, 1-5% (NH ) CO , 1:10 NH , as 1-5% NH Cl in 1:10 NH  and 1-<br>
4	4 2  3	3	4	3<br>
5% (NH ) CO  in 1:10 NH .<br>
4 2  3	3<br>
In  another  embodiment of the present invention  the  extrac<br>
tion  behaviour  W(VI),  Mo(VI), V(V),  Si(IV),  V(IV),  Al(III),<br>
Fe(III),   As(III), Ca(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II) and<br><br>
Na(I)  from  1.0x10   to  5.0 M HCl was  studied using  0.10  M<br>
kerosene solutin of (I). The extraction of W(VI) with  increasing<br>
acid molarity first increases to attain a maximum value  of  85%<br>
around  0.10 M HCl, decreases to a value of 60% at 1.0M  HCl  and<br>
then  finally becomes quantitative at 5.0M HCl.   Mo(VI)  showed<br>
quantitiative   extraction throughout  the   investigated  acid<br>
molarity.  The  extraction  of V(V) and V(IV)  is  more  or  less<br>
constant  over a wide range of acid molarity and  ranges  between<br>
40-50%  and  10-40%,  respectively.  The  percent  extraction  of<br>
Al(III)  decreases with increasing concentration of  hydrochloric<br>
-3 acid.  Fe(III)  shows quantitative extraction  from  1.0x10    to<br>
-2 1.0x10    M HCl but is drops to 85% at 5.0 M HCl. The  extraction<br>
of Zn(II) decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric<br>
acid upto 0.10 M HCl beyond which it increases. Si(IV),  As(III),<br>
Ca(II),  Mn(II), Pb(II) and Na(I) show very low extraction  (
over the entire investigated acidity range. However, Cd(II)  also<br>
shows poor extraction (
slight increase in extraction is observed. The extraction of  all<br>
these  metal ions excluding Pb(II) is more or less same in  H SO<br>
2  4<br>
medium.<br>
The extraction of W(VI) was studied in various diluents like<br>
0 n-hexane,   kerosene  (160-200 C),  toluene   cyclohexanone   and<br>
nitrobenzene. At 1.0 M HCl the highest extraction is observed  in<br>
nitrobenzene  and the lowest in tolunene. The boiling  point  and<br>
0 cost  considerations of kerosene (160-200 C) fraction suggest  it<br>
to be a preferred diluent.<br>
The  effect  of concentration of (I) on  the  extraction of<br>
W(VI)  has been studied. There is an increase in  the  extraction<br><br>
with the increase in the concentration of the extractant.<br>
The  effect of metal ion concentration on the extraction of<br>
W(VI)  has  been investigated using 0.10 M kerosene  solution of<br>
(I).  It is observed that the distribution ratio  remains  almost<br>
the same in the investigated range.<br>
The efficientcy of different reagents like 1-5% NH CI,  1-5%<br>
4<br>
(NH ) CO , 1:10 NH , 1-5% NH C1 in 1:10 NH  and 1-5% (NH ) CO  in<br>
423	3	4	3	423<br>
1:10 NH  for the back extraction of W(VI) has been  investigated. 3<br>
1:10 NH , 5% NH C1/(NH ) CO  in 1:10 NH  quantitatively recovered<br>
3       4      4 2  3	3<br>
W(VI)  from the organic phase. But in the case of 1:10  NH  the<br>
3<br>
phase  transfer is very slow and therefore 5% NH C1/(NH ) CO   in<br>
4      4 2  3<br>
1:10" NH   was used for the recovery of W(VI)  from  the  organic 3<br>
phase.<br>
The stripped organic phase can be regenerated by washing it twice with 1.0M HCl and subsequently with water. Experimetns were conducted on successive extraction-stripping cycles for W(VI) for 5.0 M HCl in the kerosene solution of (I) upto ten cycles. The results revealed practically no change in the efficiency of the extractant.<br>
Extractant (I) is a trialkyl phosphine oxide in which the alkyl groups are branched. The presence of highly branched alkyl chain may be expected to introduce greater degree of selectivity and making it a better reagent than tri-n-octylphosphine oxide for the separation of some closely associated metals. Under certain experimental conditions (I) quantitatively extracts W(VI) in the presence of others commonly associated metal ions. Because<br>
of poor aqueous solubility there is little extractant  loss  in<br><br>
each extraction-stripping cycle. The process becomes economically viable because of the good recycling capacity of the reagent and the use of kerosene as diluent. The stripping reagent used is simple in composition and yields a quantitative yield.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
c.a. 1 g of the powdered scheelite ore is fused with 5 g of<br>
sodium  hydroxide.  The  fused mass is  leached  with  water  and<br>
filtered.  The  filtrate and the washings are  combined and  the<br>
solution acidified. The volume is made to a fixed volume  keeping<br>
the  overall  molarity of HCl to 5 M.  A known  aliquot  of  this<br>
solution  is  equilibrated with equal volume of 0.10  M  kerosene<br>
solution of (I). W(VI) and Fe(III) are extracted in the  organic<br>
phase leaving Si(IV), Al(III), As(III), Ca(II), Mn(II) and  Na(I)<br>
in  the  aqueous phase. The organic layer is  equilibrated twice<br>
with half  the volume of 5% (NH ) CO  in  1:10  NH .  W(VI)  is<br>
4 2  3	3<br>
stripped  from the organic phase leaving Fe(III) in  it.  Fe(III)<br>
from the organic layer is stripped by washing it first with equal<br>
volume  of 3M HCl and then twice with half the volume of  0.10  M<br>
oxalic  acid. The recovery of W is around 98% and the  impurities<br>
like Al is 
Example 2<br>
About 1 g of the wolframite ore is fused with 5g of  caustic<br>
soda.  The  fused mass is leached with water  and  filtered.  The<br>
filtrate  and the washings are combined and acidified  with HCl.<br>
The volume  is  raised to a fixed volume keeping  the  overall<br><br>
molarity of  acid  to 5M. A known volume  of  this  solution  is<br>
equilibrated with equal volume of 0.10M kerosene solution of (I).<br>
W(VI),  Mo(VI)  and Fe(III) are extracted in the  organic phase<br>
leaving Si (IV) , Al'(III) , As (III), Ca(II), Mn(II) and Na(I) in the<br>
aqueous  phase.  W(VI) and Mo(VI) are stripped from the  organic<br>
layer by washing it twice with half the volume of 5% (NH ) CO  in<br>
4 2  3<br>
1:10 NH    Fe(III) remains in the organic phase. W(VI) and Mo(VI) 3 .<br>
are  separated  by  adusting the  pH of the  solution  to  3  and<br>
equilibrating it with equal volume of 0.10 M kerosene solution of<br>
(I).  Mo(VI) passes in to the organic layer leaving W(VI) in  the<br>
aqueous  phase.  Mo(VI)  from the organic phase  is  stripped  by<br>
washing  it  twice with half the volume of 5% (NH ) CO   in  1:10<br>
4 2  3<br>
NH . Fe(III) from the organic phase is removed by washing it with 3 *<br>
equal  volume  of 3M HCl and then twice with half the volume  of<br>
0.10  M oxalic acid. The recovery of W(VI) is around 94% and  the<br>
presence  of impurities like Mo being 
0.01%, Ca 
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1.	Recovery of pure tungsten solution from the solution of  a complex matrix in a relataively convenient way.<br>
2.	The  hydrolytic  stability, good regeneration power  of  the<br>
