				<td>Fault location using measurements of current and voltage from one end of a line<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD.<br>
The present invention is concerned with a fault location technique for a section of a power transmission line utilizing measurements of current and voltage made at terminals located at one end of the section of the power line.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Several methods and approaches for fault location in high voltage power transmission systems, and power distribution systems, have been developed and employed. One approach has been to use voltage/current transducers located at terminals located at each of two ends of a section of the power line to be monitored. Inductive current transformers are used to provide a measurement of instantaneous current in a transmission line.<br>
US 4,559,491 entitled Method and device for locating a fault point on a three-phase transmission line, describes a one-end fault location (FL) algorithm. High accuracy of fault location using a fault locator device at one end of a line is achieved by taking into account the actual distribution of a fault current in the transmission network. This algorithm has been successfully implemented into a product in 1982 and is in operation with single and parallel transmission lines in many countries around the world. However, for certain fault conditions it is difficult to obtain accurate pre-fault- quantities, such as pre-fault currents, in order to calculate an estimate for voltage drop across the fault path. Also, a disadvantage of using phase voltages and currents and zero sequence components of currents is that it is relatively difficult using these values to compensate for shunt<br>
disadvantage of using phase voltages and currents and zero sequence components of currents is that it is relatively- difficult using these values to compensate for shunt capacitance effects. In addition, the fault locator method described is not suitable for single and parallel line sections which have an extra link across the ends of the sections.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aim of the present invention is to remedy one or more of the above mentioned problems.<br>
This is obtained by a method characterised by claim 1. Specific features of the present invention are characterised by the appending claims.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a method comprising a new formulation of a one-end fault locator algorithm has been proposed. The uniform description of the transmission network in terms of symmetrical components as well as the generalized models of fault loops and faults have been applied. The resulting advantages include the algorithm can be used for locating faults in typical single and parallel transmission lines, and, in addition, fault location may also be carried out for both single and parallel lines with an extra link between the line ends. Another advantage is that a procedure for calculation of a distance to fault is in the form of a compact quadratic equation with the coefficients dependent on a fault type, acquired measurements and impedance data for the transmission network. Another advantage of the invention is that optimal estimation of the voltage drop across a fault path is applied, which has the result that the pre-fault currents in case of single phase-to-ground faults and phase- to-phase faults are no longer required. <br>
In an embodiment, compensation for shunt capacitances is facilitated by means of the use of the notation of symmetrical components. The distributed long line model of the line has been applied for that. The compensation is performed individually for all the sequences. The currents for particular sequences are compensated for the shunt currents and then the fault loop compensated current is composed. In another embodiment improved accuracy has been obtained by means of an option to measure the source impedance at the remote end instead of using a representative value. The source impedance measured at the remote end may be considered as sent to the fault locator by using a simple communication means.<br>
In another embodiment, a method for one end fault location for parallel lines to locate single phase-to-ground faults is described under a plurality of conditions. In another further embodiment a method is described for one end fault location with standard availability of the measured signals for ground faults including both single phase-to-ground faults and phase- to-phase- to-ground faults.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a fault locator device for carrying out the method of the invention is characterised by claim 18. Specific features of the inventive fault locator device are characterised by the appending claims.<br>
In another aspect of the invention a computer program is described for carrying out the method according to the invention. In another aspect of the invention a computer program product comprising a computer program for carrying out the method of the invention is described. In another, further aspect of the invention a graphical user interface is described for displaying a distance to a fault from one' end of a section of a power line.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig.l presents a schematic diagram for one-end fault location applied for parallel lines and for a power transmission or distribution system with a single line. A fault locator 1 is positioned at one end 2 of a single line AA-BA 3 or parallel lines AA-BA, AB-BB, 4. A fault F is shown at FA with a corresponding fault resistance, 5, denoted as RF . A value for distance to the fault d from one end 2 determined and provided by the fault locator 1 is indicated with the reference number 7. Components such as parallel line AB-BB and quantities such as a parallel line value zero sequence current Jabo shown with dotted lines are excluded when considering a single line case.<br>
The fault locator 1 positioned at the first end 2, or 'A' end, is supplied with the following input signals:<br>
-	three-phase voltages (VAft) of the faulted line,<br>
-	three-phase voltages (IRA) of the faulted line,<br>
-	zero sequence current (Iabo) from the healthy parallel line (zero sequence is not present when the single line only is considered).<br>
Fig.2 a,b,c show circuit diagrams of a parallel transmission network for the positive 2a, negative 2b, and zero sequence 2c components. Fault loops for the sequence components 21a, 21b, 21c are shown for the case of a fault locator installed at the terminal AA. An extra link 25 between the terminals A, B is shown.. A generalized model of the fault loop considered for different fault types is stated as:<br>
VM_v ~dZUAI_M_p -RF{aFlLn + aF2lF2 +aFOlFO) = 0	(D<br>
where:<br>
d - unknown and sought distance to fault, —im ~ positive sequence impedance of the faulted line,<br>
^-MJP&gt; LAAJP ~ fault loop voltage and current compo.sed according to the fault type, RF - fault resistance,<br>
IFi ~ sequence components of the total fault current (i = 0, i = 1, ±=2),<br>
aFi - weighting coefficients (TABLE 2) .<br>
Fault loop voltage and current can be expressed in terms of the symmetrical components of measured voltages /currents: VM_P =a1VAAl +azVAA2 +a0VAA0	(2)<br>

where:<br>
AA, AB - subscripts used for indicating measurements- acquired from the faulted line (AA) and from the healthy line (AB), respectively,<br>
«0' fii' Sl2 ~ coefficients which are gathered in TABLE 1 (the Tables are arranged below at the end of the description of embodiments and derivation of these coefficients is shown in APPENDIX Al, also attached).<br>
ZOLA &gt; Z0m - impedance of the faulted line and mutual coupling between the lines for the zero sequence, respectively, &amp;om=£o ~	parallel lines,<br>
£om=0 ~ for single lines.<br>
The phasors of symmetrical components of voltages, positive: V_AA\&gt; negative: VM2 and zero sequence: VM0 as well as the phasors of symmetrical components of currents, positive: /M1, negative: LAA% &gt; zero sequence from the faulted line: I A/to and zero sequence from the healthy line: 1AB„ are calculated from<br>
the acquired measurements as shown schematically in schematic block diagrams Figures 3a and 3b.<br>
Figure 3a shows an input of instantaneous phase voltages 30a, filtering stage 33a, phasors of phase voltages 31a, calculation of phasors of symmetrical components 33b and phasors of symmetrical components of voltages output at 32a. It may be seen from Fig 3a that acquired phase voltage measurements are subjected to a filter, then calculations are made to find the symmetrical components of the fault loop voltage. Figure 3b shows correspondingly stages used to find the symmetrical components of the fault loop current. Figure 3b shows instantaneous phase currents and instantaneous zero sequence current from the healthy line 30b, filtering 33b, phasors of phase currents and phasor of zero sequence current from the healthy line 31b, calculation 34b and phasors of symmetrical components of currents output at 32b.<br>
Fault loop signals may be composed according to formulae (2)- (3) and TABLE 1, which is the alternative to the classic approach (TABLE 1A, fault loop voltage (VM_f) and current<br>
( Za4_p ) ' which was used in the fault locator from [1-2].<br>
Voltage drop across a fault path resistance, the third term in (1) , can be expressed in terms of the current distribution factors and local measurements of currents which results in:<br>
Km, - dZ^LM^ - L ^ + + 0 W)«0	(4)<br>
v,	tF2	—FQ J<br>
Formula (4) has been obtained from the following relations between the symmetrical components of a total fault current and measured currents: <br>
where:<br>
LFI ; LF2; LFO - symmetrical components of a total fault current,<br>
k-Fi &gt; k.F2 , kF{j - fault current distribution factors for particular sequence quantities,<br>
^I-AAI = LAAI ~LMIPRE' LAA2&gt; LAAO ~ symmetrical components of currents measured in the line A at the station A (subscript AA) ; note that in case of the positive sequence the incremental quantity (post-fault current minus pre-fault current) is used.<br>
Voltage drop across the fault path, as shown in the third term in equation (1) , is expressed using sequence components of the total fault current. The weighting coefficients aF0, aF1, aF2, can accordingly be determined by taking the boundary conditions for particular fault type. See TABLE 2, Alternative sets of the weighting coefficients for determining a voltage drop across the fault path resistance. Examples of derivation of these coefficients are contained in APPENDIX A2.<br>
There is some freedom for setting the weighting coefficients. It is proposed to utilize this freedom firstly for avoiding zero sequence quantities, since the zero sequence impedance of a line may be considered as an unreliable parameter. This can<br>
be accomplished by setting aFO=0 as sllown in TABLE 2-<br>
Secondly, the freedom in establishing the weighting coefficients can be utilized for determining the preference for using particular quantities. The negative sequence (TABLE 2, set I) or the positive sequence (TABLE 2, set II) can be<br>
preferred as well as possibly both types of the quantities (TABLE 2, set III) can be used for determining the voltage drop across the fault path.<br>
The set I is recommended for further use, thus avoiding, the positive sequence, and thus avoiding the pre-fault positive sequence current, for the largest number of faults. Avoiding the pre-fault positive sequence current is highly desirable since sometimes the pre-fault currents - due to certain reasons - can not be recorded or registered, but may be contaminated by one or more the symptoms of the occurring fault. Moreover, the accuracy of recording the pre-fault currents, which are basically lower than the post-fault currents, is not very great. This is so since the A/D converters operate with less accuracy in the low range.<br>
Fault current distribution factors depend on the configuration of the transmission network, Figures 4, 5, and impedance parameters. Basically, all impedances for the positive and for the negative sequence are equal to each other and thus one obtains:<br>
k k M±kL	(6)<br>
-FL -F 2 ^<br>
Coefficients in a fault current distribution factor (6) for a single (Figure 4) and for parallel lines (Figure 5) are gathered in TABLE 3, Coefficients for determining a fault current distribution factor, (note that derivation of the coefficients is shown in APPENDIX A3).<br>
Figure 4 shows a circuit diagram of a single line for determining the fault current distribution factor for the positive sequence currents and with the negative sequence currents such as shown in brackets. Similarly Figure 5 shows a circuit diagram of parallel lines for determining the fault current distribution factor with <br>
positive sequence currents wherein the negative sequence currents are shown in brackets.<br>
In Fig.4 the extra link 45 between the terminals A, B having impedance for the positive sequence equal to: ZXAB can be considered as existing	) or as not present (ZlAB -&gt;«=).<br>
In Fig. 5 the extra link 55 between the terminals A, B having impedance for the positive sequence equal to: ZlAB can be<br>

After multiplying both sides of (7) by: =±	and some<br>

Combining (8b) and (8c) in such the way that fault resistance is eliminated [that is, equation (8b) is multiplied by /loo_:foi and equation (8c) by ^o_Re and then subtracting them] yields the quadratic formula for a sought fault distance:<br>
Equation (9) has two roots (di, d2) for the distance to fault:<br>
The root which fulfils the condition (0£d
In another embodiment of the invention, the method of fault location is carried out by using a measurement of source impedance at the second end remote from the fault locator 1, instead of a representative value for the source impedance at the remote end, and by communicating that measured value to the local end using a communication means. Coefficients- from (9) are determined with the local measurements and the impedance data for the transmission line, the extra link between the line terminals and the equivalent systems at the line terminals. Impedance of the equivalent system at the local substation (ZllA) can be traced on-line with the local measurements. In contrast, the remote system impedance (ZljB) is not measurable locally from A. Thus, the "representative" value of this impedance may be provided for the algorithm [1- 2] .<br>
The alternative solution for the single line case is shown in Figure 6, which shows a fault locator 1 at the first end 2 near to system A, and another device 10 located at the temote end 3 close to system B, indicated as RD. A communication signal 9 is shown being sent from the 10 at the remote end to the fault locator 1 at the local end.<br>
The remote source impedance (ZUB) is measured by the remote device RD, 10, which may be another fault locator or any suitable device such as a digital relay or digital fault recorder, in the remote substation and the measurement 9 is sent via a communication channel 60. Synchronization of measurements at the line terminals is not required. The source impedance is calculated from the known relation between the incremental positive voltage {AV_m) and the incremental<br>
positive sequence current (AI_Bi) [3-4]:<br>
bimnarly, the fault locator 1 calculates the local source impedance<br>

In another and preferred embodiment of the invention, compensation is carried out for the shunt capacitance of the line. Compensation for shunt capacitances effect can be accomplished by taking into account the lumped model (only the longitudinal R-XL parameters are taken into account) or the distributed long transmission line model. The distributed long line model [5] as providing higher accuracy of fault location, has been considered here.<br>
The compensation for the single line is presented further. This means that when composing fault loop current (3) the term reflecting the mutual coupling effect disappears [a0m= 0). Moreover, the single subscript {A instead of AA) is used.<br>
Fault location procedure with compensating for shunt capacitances of a transmission line requires the following additional input data:<br>
ClL - shunt capacitance of a whole line for the positive and the negative sequences (parameters of a line for the positive and the negative sequences are identical and thus: C2L = ClL) C0L - shunt capacitance of a whole line for the zero sequence, I - total line length (km), used for expressing impedances/capacitances of the line per km length.<br>
The compensation of shunt capacitances may be introduced while determining the voltage drop across the faulted line segment - the second term in the generalized fault loop model (1) . This requires compensating the components of the calculated currents for particular sequences. Thus, the original measured <br>
currents: IAl , /A2 , IAQ have to be replaced by the currents<br>
after the introduced compensation: I_M_conip, LA2comp , I_A,_comp .<br>
At the same time the original fault loop voltage, the first term in the model (1), is taken for a distance to fault calculation. As concerns determining the voltage drop across the fault resistance, the third term in (1), it is assumed here, which is a standard practice, that the effect of line capacitances at the location of the fault (point F) , may be neglected. This is justified as the impedance of the capacitive branch at that location is much greater than the fault resistance. This means that the voltage drop across the fault resistance is determined without taking into account the shunt capacitances.<br>
Calculating a distance to fault the following impedances (defined below) are taken as:<br>
?LILS ~ positive sequence impedance of a line with taking into account the distributed long line model, ZLQL - as above, but for the zero sequence.<br>
The compensation procedure requires iterative calculations, performed until the convergence is achieved (i.e. iterated until the location estimate ceases to differ from the previous estimate). However, the studies conducted revealed that results of acceptable accuracy may be obtained using a fixed number of iterations, for example, 2-3 iterations. The calculated distance to a fault from a particular (say, present iteration) is utilized for determining the shunt current in the next iteration. The determined shunt current is then deduced from the measured current. A distance to fault, calculated without considering the shunt effect (10), is taken as the starting value for the first iteration.<br>
A way of conducting the first iteration of the compensation is shown in Figures 7, 8, 9 for the positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence respectively with taking into account the shunt capacitances effect.<br>
As a result of performing the first iteration for the positive sequence (Figure 7) the compensated current LAi_comp_i is calculated and the last index in the subscript denotes the first iteration. The calculation is based on deducing the shunt current from the calculated positive sequence current calculated from the measured phase currents - Fig.2:<br>
LAl_comp^\ = LAI - °-5dvl&amp;.\L£txritil¥.Al	(12 )<br>

Positive sequence impedance of a faulted line segment, between points A and F, without taking into account the shunt capacitances effect and considering the lumped line model equals:<br>

Thus, the positive sequence impedance of a line with taking into account the distributed long line model [Z'^s ) equals:<br>

As a result of performing the first iteration for the negative sequence (Figure 8) the compensated current LA2_comp_i<br>
calculated and the last index in the subscript denotes the first iteration. This is based on deducing the shunt current from the calculated negative sequence current I_AZ , calculated from the measured phase currents - Fig.2):<br>

The root, which corresponds to the selected previously root (10) for d (uncompensated) is taken as the valid result. The compensation procedure requires iterative calculations, performed until the convergence is achieved (i.e. until the location estimates cease to change from the previous estimates) or as with a fixed number of iterations such as 2-3 iterations. The calculated distance to a fault from a particular (say, present iteration) is utilized for determining the shunt current in the next iteration. <br>
The method of the invention is illustrated in two flow-charts of the FL algorithm, Figure 10, single line and in Figure 11, parallel lines.<br>
As shown in the flowchart in Figure 10 the following measurements are utilized:<br>

-	information on the fault type (from the protective relay) .<br>
The measured fault quantities (voltages and currents) undergo 25 adaptive filtering at step 104, Adaptive filtering of phase<br>
quantities, aimed at rejecting the dc components from currents and the transients induced by Capacitive Voltage Transformers (CVTs).<br>
In the next step the symmetrical components of voltages and 3 0 currents are calculated, step 105, which is equivalent to that as shown in Figures 3a, 3b. The fault loop signals are <br><br>

The distance to fault without taking into account the shunt capacitances effect (d) is calculated at step 106 by solving 5 the quadratic formula (9) . The solution of (9) is presented in (10) .<br>
The result obtained without taking into account the shunt capacitances effect d following 106 is treated as the starting value for performing the compensation for shunt capacitances. 10 The distributed long line model is applied for the compensation.<br>
The following additional data is required for the calculating the compensation for shunt capacitance, step 107:<br>
-	positive sequence capacitance of the line (Cj£)<br>
-	zero sequence capacitance of the line (C0L)<br>
-	line length (I) , which is used to express line impedances / capacitances per km length.<br>
The first iteration of the compensation leads to the quadratic equation (22), which is solved in (23). The next iterations are performed analogously. Iterative calculations are performed until the convergence is achieved or a fixed number of iterations, i.e. 2-3 iterations, may be made. The calculated distance to a fault from a particular (say, present iteration) is utilized for determining the shunt current in the next iteration. After completing the iterative calculations the distance to fault dcomp is obtained.<br>

20 The measured fault quantities, the voltages and currents, undergo adaptive filtering at step 114 for the purpose of rejecting the dc components from currents and the transients induced by Capacitive Voltage Transformers (CVTs).<br>
In the next step 115 the symmetrical components of voltages 25 and currents are calculated as shown in Figures 3a, 3b. The<br>

the quadratic formula (9). The solution of (9) is presented in (10).<br>
The result obtained without taking into account the shunt capacitances effect (d) is treated as the starting value for 5 performing the compensation for shunt capacitances. The<br>
distributed long line model is applied for the compensation.<br>
The following additional data for the faulted line is required for the compensation for shunt capacitances step 117:<br>
-	positive sequence capacitance of the line (C1L) 10 - zero sequence capacitance of the line (C0L)<br>
-	line length (1) , which is used to express line impedances / capacitances per km length.<br>
In the case of a single line, the compensation is performed 15 analogously. Iterative calculations are performed until the convergence is achieved or by using a fixed number of iterations, e.g. 2-3 iterations. The calculated distance to a fault from a particular iteration, for example the present iteration, is utilized for determining the shunt current in 20 the next iteration. After completing the iterative calculations the distance to fault dcomp is obtained.<br>

10 A2. Derivation of coefficients aFl, aF2, aF0 (TABLE 2)<br>
TABLE 2 contains three alternative sets (Set I, Set II, Set III) of the weighting coefficients, which are used for determining a voltage drop across a fault path. The coefficients are calculated from the boundary conditions - 15 relevant for a particular fault type. This is distinctive that in all the sets the zero sequence is omitted (aFO=0) . This is advantage since the zero sequence impedance of a line is considered as the uncertain parameter. By setting aF0=0 we limit adverse influence of the uncertainty with respect to the 20 zero sequence impedance data upon the fault location accuracy. To be precise one has to note that this limitation is of course partial since it is related only to determining the voltage drop across a fault path. In contrast, while determining the voltage drop across a faulted line segment the 25 zero sequence impedance of the line is used.<br>
Thus: at = a2 = a0 = 1<br>

A3. Derivation of the complex coefficients in the fault 5 current distribution factors for the positive (negative) sequence (Table 3)<br>
a) Case of the single line with extra link 45 between the substations (Figure 4)<br>
10 Let us determine the fault current distribution factor for the positive sequence (the fault current distribution factor for the negative sequence is the same) . The equivalent circuit of Figure 4 with indicated flow of currents for the incremental positive sequence is presented in Figure 16.<br>
15<br>
Considering the closed mesh containing: the local segment of the faulted line, the remote segment of the faulted line and the extra link between the substations, one can write down:<br>
DZLLAI_AL + (1 - d)ZXL (ALM-LFL)-ZIABALABI = 0<br>
20 From the above equation the unknown current from the extra link between the substation can be determined as:<br>
AB<br>
Considering the closed mesh containing the source impedances (ZlsA , ZUB) and the extra link (ZlAB) one can write down:<br>
25 ZUA(ALai + ALABI) + ZIABALABI +ZUB(ALAI + AIABI ~/f1) = 0<br>
Substituting the previously determined unknown current from the extra link into the above equation one obtains: <br>

where, as in TABLE 3 (Single line, Z	) , we have:<br>

Ml = (Z1M	+Zil)+Z1lZub<br>
If there is no extra link between the substations (ZMfl ) one has to consider the closed mesh containing the source impedances (ZUA, ZlsB) and both the segments of the faulted 10 line [dZlL and (l-d)ZlL] . For this mesh one can write:<br>
(Z+ dZ lt) AI_ Al + [Z lsB + (1 - d)Zx l\AI_ A1 - / K i) = 0 After rearrangements one obtains:<br>
where, as in TABLE 3 (Single line, ZlAB ) , we have: 15 Kx=-ZlL<br>
Mi =zlsA+zlsA +zlL<br>
b) Case of the parallel lines with extra link between the 20 substation (Figure 5)<br>
Let us determine the fault current distribution factor for the positive sequence (the fault current distribution factor for the negative sequence is the same). The equivalent circuit of 25 parallel lines from Fig.5 with indicated flow of currents for the incremental positive sequence is presented in Figure 17.<br>
WO 2004/001431	PCT/SE2003/001091<br>
The healthy parallel line (LB) and the extra link 55 (AB) , which are in parallel connection, have been substituted by the equivalent branch with the equivalent impedance:<br>

DZILA^L/M + (1 - D)Z\LA WIAAX -IFO - —ILB&amp;AB^—LB&amp;ABL = 0<br>
From the above equation the -unknown current from the equivalent branch can be determined as:<br>
10 AlLB&amp;ABl=-^L-{ALAAl-(X-d)LFl)<br>
—ILB&amp;.AB<br>
Considering the closed mesh containing the source impedances SA&gt; ZL\SB ) and THE equivalent branch (ZLLB&amp;AB) one can write down:<br>
Z.ISA(ALAAI + ALLB&amp;.AB0+S-ILB&amp;AB^LLB&amp;ABI +ZLSB(ALMI + ALLB&amp;ABI ~LF\)=°<br>
15 Substituting the previously determined unknown current from the healthy line into the above equation one obtains:<br>
k =ALAAI =K1d + Ll ~F1 LFX MI<br>
where, as in TABLE 3 (Parallel lines), we have:<br>
Kt = ~£ILA(Z-ISA SB +Z±ILB&amp;AB) ' 20 =Z1LA(Z1M + ZljB+Z1ZiB&amp;AB)+Z1LB&amp;AfiZljB1<br>

in case if the extra link between the substations (Z1AB) is not present one has to substitute: Z1LB&amp;AB =ZLLB <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
