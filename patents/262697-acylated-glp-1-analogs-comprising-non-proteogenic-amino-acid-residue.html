				<td>ACYLATED GLP-1 COMPOUNDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of therapeutic peptides, i.e. to new protracted GLP-1 compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A range of different approaches have been used for modifying the structure of glucagon-like<br>
peptide 1 (GLP-1) compounds in order to provide a longer duration of action in vivo.<br>
WO 96/29342 discloses peptide hormone derivatives wherein the parent peptide hormone<br>
has been modified by introducing a lipophilic substituent in the C-terminal amino acid residue<br>
or in the N-termina! amino acid residue.<br>
WO 98/08871 discloses GLP-1 derivatives wherein at least one amino acid residue of the<br>
parent peptide has a lipophilic substituent attached.<br>
WO 99/43708 discloses GLP-1 (7-35) and GLP-1 (7-36) derivatives which have a lipophilic<br>
substituent attached to the C-terminal amino acid residue.<br>
WO 00/34331 discloses acylated GLP-1 analogs.<br>
WO 00/69911 discloses activated insulinotropic peptides to be injected into patients where<br>
they are supposed to react with blood components to form conjugates and thereby alledgedly<br>
providing longer duration of action in vivo.<br>
WO 02/46227 discloses GLP-1 and exendin-4 analogs fused to human serum albumin in<br>
order to extend in vivo half-life.<br>
Many diabetes patients particularly in the type 2 diabetes segment are subject to so-called "needle-phobia", i.e. a substantial fear of injecting themselves. In the type 2 diabetes segment most patients are treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents, and since GLP-1 compounds are expected to be the first injectable product these patients will be administered, the fear of injections may become a serious obstacle for the widespread use of the clinically very promising GLP-1 compounds. Thus, there is a need to develop new GLP-1 compounds which can be administered less than once daily, e.g. once every second or third day preferably once weekly, while retaining an acceptable clinical profile.<br>
The invention provides a GLP-1 analog having a modification of at least one non-proteogenic amino acid residue in positions 7 and/or 8 relative to the sequence GLP-1 (7-37) (SEQ ID No 1), which is acylated with a moiety to the lysine residue in position 26, and where said moiety comprises at least two acidic groups, wherein one acidic group is attached terminally.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound according to the present invention and the use of compounds according to the present invention for preparing medicaments for treating disease.<br>
The invention provides a method for increasing the time of action in a patient of a GLP-1 analog, characterised in acylating said GLP-1 analog with a moiety B-U' as disclosed in any of the preceding claims, on the lysine residue in position 26 of said GLP-1 analog.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present specification, the following terms have the indicated meaning :<br>
The term "polypeptide" and "peptide" as used herein means a compound composed of at least five constituent amino acids connected by peptide bonds. The constituent amino acids may be from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g., v-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (a-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (a-aminobutyric acid), Tie (tert-butylglycine), (3-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid.<br>
The 22 proteogenic amino acids are:<br>
Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic acid, Cysteine, Cystine, Glutamine, Glutamic acid, Glycine, Histidine, Hydroxyproline, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Valine.<br>
Thus a non-proteogenic amino acid is a moiety which can be incorporated into a peptide via peptide bonds but is not a proteogenic amino acid. Examples are γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, the D-amino acids such as D-alanine and D-glutamine, Synthetic non-proteogenic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine,<br>
Aib (a-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (a-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), 3-aminomethyl benzole acid, anthranilic acid, des-amino-Histidine, the beta analogs of amino acids such as β-alanine etc. D-histidine, desamino-histidine, 2-amino-histidfne, β-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, N°-acetyl-histidine, α-fluoromethyl-histidine, α-methyl-histidine, 3-pyridylalanine, 2-pyridylalanine or 4-pyridylalanine, (1-aminocyclopropyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclobutyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclopentyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclohexyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocycloheptyl) carboxylic acid, or (1-aminocyclooctyl) carboxylic acid;<br>
The term "analogue" as used herein referring to a polypeptide means a modified peptide wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been substituted by other amino acid residues and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide and or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the peptide. Such addition or deletion of amino acid residues can take place at the N-terminal of the peptide and/or at the C-terminal of the peptide. A simple system is often used to describe analogues : For example [Arg34]GLP-1(7-37)Lys designates a GLP-1(7-37) analogue wherein the naturally occurring lysine at position 34 has been substituted with arginine and wherein a lysine has been added to the terminal amino acid residue, i.e. to the Gly37. All amino acids for which the optical isomer is not stated is to be understood to mean the L-isomer. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 17 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 15 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 10 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 8 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 7 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 6 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 5 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 4 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 3 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 2 amino acids have been modified. In embodiments of the invention 1 amino acid has been modified.<br>
The term "derivative" as used herein in relation to a peptide means a chemically modified peptide or an analogue thereof, wherein at least one substituent is not present in the unmodified peptide or an analogue thereof, i.e. a peptide which has been covalently modified. Typical modifications are amides, carbohydrates, alkyl groups, acyl groups, esters and the like. An example of a derivative of GLP-1(7-37) is Ne26-((4S)-4-(hexadecanoylamino)-carboxy-butanoyl)[Arg34, Lys26]GLP-1-(7-37).<br>
The term "GLP-1 peptide" as used herein means GLP-1(7-37) (SEQ ID No 1), a GLP-1(7-37) analogue, a GLP-1 (7-37) derivative or a derivative of a GLP-1 (7-37) analogue. In one embodiment the GLP-1 peptide is an insulinotropic agent.<br>
The term "insulinotropic agent" as used herein means a compound which is an agonist of the human GLP-1 receptor, i.e. a compound which stimulates the formation of cAMP in a suitable medium containing the human GLP-1 receptor (one such medium disclosed below). The potency of an insulinotropic agent is determined by calculating the EC50 value from the dose-response curve as described below.<br>
Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor (BHK- 467-12A) were grown in DMEM media with the addition of 100 lU/mL penicillin, 100 pg/mL streptomycin, 5% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/mL Geneticin G-418 (Life Technologies). The cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline and harvested with Versene. Plasma membranes were prepared from the cells by homogenisation with an Ultraturrax in buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES-Na, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended by homogenization in buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES-Na. 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), then centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The washing procedure was repeated one more time. The final pellet was suspended in buffer 2 and used immediately for assays or stored at -80°C.<br>
The functional receptor assay was carried out by measuring cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a response to stimulation by the insulinotropic agent. cAMP formed was quantified by the AlphaScreen™ cAMP Kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Incubations were carried out in half-area 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 50 μL buffer 3 (50 mM Tris-HCI, 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCI2, pH 7.4) and with the following addiditions: 1 mM ATP, 1 μM GTP, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.01 % Tween-20, 0.1% BSA, 6 ug membrane preparation, 15 μg/mL acceptor beads, 20μg/mL donor beads preincubated with 6 nM biotinyl-cAMP. Compounds to be tested for agonist activity were dissolved and diluted in buffer 3. GTP was freshly prepared for each experiment. The plate was incubated in the dark with slow agitation for three hours at room temperature followed by counting in the Fusion™ instrument (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Concentration-response curves were plotted for the individual compounds and EC50 values estimated using a four-parameter logistic model with<br>
Prism v. 4.0 (GraphPad, Carlsbad, CA).<br>
The term "DPP-IV protected" as used herein referring to a polypeptide means a<br>
polypeptide which has been chemically modified in order to render said compound resistant to the plasma peptidase dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-4 (DPP-IV). The DPP-IV enzyme in plasma is known to be involved in the degradation of several peptide hormones, e.g. GLP-1, GLP-2, Exendin-4 etc. Thus, a considerable effort is being made to develop analogues and derivatives<br>
of the polypeptides susceptible to DPP-IV mediated hydrolysis in order to reduce the rate of degradation by DPP-IV. In one embodiment a DPP-IV protected peptide is more resistant to DPP-IV than GLP-1 (7-37) or Exendin-4(1-39).<br>
Resistance of a peptide to degradation by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is determined by the following degradation assay:<br>
Aliquots of the peptide (5 nmol) are incubated at 37 °C with 1 μL of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV corresponding to an enzymatic activity of 5 mil for 10-180 minutes in 100 μl of 0.1 M triethylamine-HCI buffer, pH 7.4. Enzymatic reactions are terminated by the addition of 5 μL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide degradation products are separated and quantified using HPLC analysis. One method for performing this analysis is : The mixtures are applied onto a Vydac C18 widepore (30 nm pores, 5 urn particles) 250 x 4.6 mm column and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with linear stepwise gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0% acetonitrile for 3 min, 0-24% acetonitrile for 17 min, 24-48% acetonitrile for 1 min) according to Siegel et al., Regul. Pept. 1999;79:93-102 and Mentlein et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993;214:829-35. Peptides and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and are quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards. The rate of hydrolysis of a peptide by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is estimated at incubation times which result in less than 10% of the peptide being hydrolysed.<br>
The term "C1.6-alkyl" as used herein means a saturated, branched, straight or cyclic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl, cyclohexane and the like.

More particularly, compositions of the invention are stabilized liquid pharmaceutical compositions whose therapeutically active components include a polypeptide that possibly exhibits aggregate formation during storage in liquid pharmaceutical formulations. By "aggregate formation" is intended a physical interaction between the polypeptide molecules that results in formation of oligomers, which may remain soluble, or large visible aggregates that precipitate from the solution. By "during storage" is intended a liquid pharmaceutical composition or formulation once prepared, is not immediately administered to a subject. Rather, following preparation, it is packaged for storage, either in a liquid form, in a frozen state, or in a dried form for later reconstitution into a liquid form or other form suitable for administration to a subject. By "dried form" is intended the liquid pharmaceutical composition or formulation is dried either by freeze drying (i.e., lyophilization; see, for example, Williams and Polli (1984) J. Parenteral Sci. Technol. 38:48-59), spray drying (see Masters (1991) in Spray-Drying Handbook (5th ed; Longman Scientific and Technical, Essez, U.K.), pp. 491-676; Broadhead etal. (1982) Drug Devel. Ind. Pharm. 18:1169-1206; and Mumenthaler et al. (1994) Pharm. Res. 11:12-20), or air drying (Carpenter and Crowe (1988) Cryobiology 25:459-470; and Roser (1991) Biopharm. 4:47-53). Aggregate formation by a polypeptide during storage of a liquid pharmaceutical composition can adversely affect biological activity of that polypeptide, resulting in loss of therapeutic efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition. Furthermore, aggregate formation may cause other problems such as blockage of tubing, membranes, or pumps when the polypeptide-containing pharmaceutical composition is administered using an infusion system.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise an amount of an amino acid base sufficient to decrease aggregate formation by the polypeptide during storage of the composition. By "amino acid base" is intended an amino acid or a combination of amino acids, where any given amino acid is present either in its free base form or in its salt form. Where a combination of amino acids is used, all of the amino acids may be present in their free base forms, all may be present in their salt forms, or some may be present in their free base forms while others are present in their salt forms. In one embodiment, amino acids to use in preparing the compositions of the invention are those carrying a charged side chain, such as arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Any stereoisomer (i.e., L, D, or a mixture thereof) of a particular amino acid (e.g. methionine, histidine, imidazole, arginine, lysine, isoleucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, threonine and mixtures thereof) or combinations of these stereoisomers, may be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention so long as the particular amino acid is present either in its free base form or its salt form. In one embodiment the L-stereoisomer is used. Compositions of the invention may also be formulated with analogues of these amino acids. By "amino acid analogue" is intended a<br>
derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid that brings about the desired effect of decreasing aggregate formation by the polypeptide during storage of the liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Suitable arginine analogues include, for example, aminoguanidine, ornithine and N-monoethyl L-arginine, suitable methionine analogues include ethionine and buthionine and suitable cysteine analogues include S-methyl-L cysteine. As with the other amino acids, the amino acid analogues are incorporated into the compositions in either their free base form or their salt form. In a further embodiment of the invention the amino acids or amino acid analogues are used in a concentration, which is sufficient to prevent or delay aggregation of the protein.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention methionine (or other sulphuric amino acids or amino acid analogous) may be added to inhibit oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide when the polypeptide acting as the therapeutic agent is a polypeptide comprising at least one methionine residue susceptible to such oxidation. By "inhibit" is intended minimal accumulation of methionine oxidized species over time. Inhibiting methionine oxidation results in greater retention of the polypeptide in its proper molecular form. Any stereoisomer of methionine (L or D) or combinations thereof can be used. The amount to be added should be an amount sufficient to inhibit oxidation of the methionine residues such that the amount of methionine sulfoxide is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Typically, this means that the composition contains no more than about 10% to about 30% methionine sulfoxide. Generally, this can be achieved by adding methionine such that the ratio of methionine added to methionine residues ranges from about 1:1 to about 1000:1, such as 10:1 to about 100:1.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the formulation further comprises a stabilizer selected from the group of high molecular weight polymers or low molecular compounds. In a further embodiment of the invention the stabilizer is selected from polyethylene glycol (e.g. PEG 3350), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxy-/hydroxycellulose or derivates thereof (e.g. HPC, HPC-SL, HPC-L and HPMC), cyclodextrins, sulphur-containing substances as monothioglycerol, thioglycolic acid and 2-methylthioethanol, and different salts (e.g. sodium chloride). Each one of these specific stabilizers constitutes an alternative embodiment of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise additional stabilizing agents, which further enhance stability of a therapeutically active polypeptide therein. Stabilizing agents of particular interest to the present invention include, but are not limited to, methionine and EDTA, which protect the polypeptide against methionine oxidation, and a nonionic surfactant, which protects the polypeptide against aggregation associated with freeze-thawing or mechanical shearing.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the formulation further comprises a surfactant. In another embodiment of the invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises two different surfactants. The term "Surfactant" as used herein refers to any molecules or ions that are comprised of a water-soluble (hydrophilic) part, the head, and a fat-soluble (lipophilic) segment. Surfactants accumulate preferably at interfaces, which the hydrophilic part is orientated towards the water (hydrophilic phase) and the lipophilic part towards the oil- or hydrophobic phase (i.e. glass, air, oil etc.). The concentration at which surfactants begin to form micelles is known as the critical micelle concentration or CMC. Furthermore, surfactants lower the surface tension of a liquid. Surfactants are also known as amphipathic compounds. The term "Detergent" is a synonym used for surfactants in general.<br>

General reference is made to Handbook of Pharmaceutical Controlled Release (Wise, D.L., ed. Marcel Dekker, New York, 2000) and Drug and the Pharmaceutical Sciences vol. 99: Protein Formulation and Delivery (MacNally, E.J., ed. Marcel Dekker, New York, 2000). Parenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively, parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further option is a composition which may be a solution or suspension or a powder for the administration of the compound of the present invention in the form of a nasal or pulmonal liquid or powder spray. As a still further option, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the compound of the invention can also be adapted to transdermal administration, e.g. by needle-free injection or from a patch, optionally an iontophoretic patch, or transmucosal, e.g. buccak administration.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered via the pulmonary route in a vehicle, as a solution, suspension or dry powder using any of known types of devices suitable for pulmonary drug delivery. Examples of these comprise, but are not limited to, the three general types of aerosol-generating for pulmonary drug delivery, and may include jet or ultrasonic nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, or dry powder inhalers (Cf. Yu J, Chien YW. Pulmonary drug delivery: Physiologic and mechanistic aspects. Crit Rev Ther Drug Carr Sys 14(4) (1997) 395-453).<br>
Based on standardised testing methodology, the aerodynamic diameter (da) of a particle is defined as the geometric equivalent diameter of a reference standard spherical particle of unit density (1 g/cm3). In the simplest case, for spherical particles, da is related to a reference diameter (d) as a function of the square root of the density ratio as described by:<br>
Modifications to this relationship occur for non-spherical particles (cf. Edwards DA, Ben-Jebria A, Langer R. Recent advances in pulmonary drug delivery using large, porous inhaled particles. J Appl Physiol 84(2) (1998) 379-385). The terms "MMAD" and "MMEAD" are well-described and known to the art (cf. Edwards DA, Ben-Jebria A, Langer R and represents a measure of the median value of an aerodynamic particle size distribution. Recent advances in pulmonary drug delivery using large, porous inhaled particles. J Appl Physiol 84(2) (1998) 379-385). Mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and mass median effective aerodynamic diameter (MMEAD) are used inter-changeably, are statistical parameters, and empirically describe the size of aerosol particles in relation to their potential to deposit in the lungs, independent of actual shape, size, or density (cf. Edwards DA, Ben-Jebria A, Langer R. Recent advances in pulmonary drug delivery using large, porous inhaled particles. J Appl Physiol 84(2) (1998) 379-385). MMAD is normally calculated from the measurement made with impactors, an instrument that measures the particle inertial behaviour in air. In a further embodiment, the formulation could be aerosolized by any known aerosolisation technology, such as nebulisation, to achieve a MMAD of aerosol particles less than 10 urn, more preferably between 1-5 urn, and most preferably between 1-3 μm. The preferred particle size is based on the most effective size for delivery of drug to the deep lung, where protein is optimally absorbed (cf. Edwards DA, Ben-Jebria A, Langer A, Recent advances in pulmonary drug delivery using large, porous inhaled particles. J Appl Physiol 84(2) (1998) 379-385).<br>
Deep lung deposition of the pulmonal formulations comprising the compound of the present invention may optional be further optimized by using modifications of the inhalation techniques, for example, but not limited to: slow inhalation flow (eg. 30 L/min), breath holding and timing of actuation.<br>
The term "stabilized formulation" refers to a formulation with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability.<br>
The term "physical stability" of the protein formulation as used herein refers to the tendency of the protein to form biologically inactive and/or insoluble aggregates of the protein as a result of exposure of the protein to thermo-mechanical stresses and/or interaction with interfaces and surfaces that are destabilizing, such as hydrophobic surfaces and interfaces. Physical stability of the aqueous protein formulations is evaluated by means of visual inspection and/or turbidity measurements after exposing the formulation filled in suitable containers (e.g. cartridges or vials) to mechanical/physical stress (e.g. agitation) at different temperatures for various time periods. Visual inspection of the formulations is performed in a<br><br>
sharp focused light with a dark background. The turbidity of the formulation is characterized by a visual score ranking the degree of turbidity for instance on a scale from 0 to 3 (a formulation showing no turbidity corresponds to a visual score 0, and a formulation showing visual turbidity in daylight corresponds to visual score 3). A formulation is classified physical unstable with respect to protein aggregation, when it shows visual turbidity in daylight. Alternatively, the turbidity of the formulation can be evaluated by simple turbidity measurements well-known to the skilled person. Physical stability of the aqueous protein formulations can also be evaluated by using a spectroscopic agent or probe of the conformational status of the protein. The probe is preferably a small molecule that preferentially binds to a non-native conformer of the protein. One example of a small molecular spectroscopic probe of protein structure is Thioflavin T. Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye that has been widely used for the detection of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of fibrils, and perhaps other protein configurations as well, Thioflavin T gives rise to a new excitation maximum at about 450 nm and enhanced emission at about 482 nm when bound to a fibril protein form. Unbound Thioflavin T is essentially non-fluorescent at the wavelengths.<br>
Other small molecules can be used as probes of the changes in protein structure from native to non-native states. For instance the "hydrophobic patch" probes that bind preferentially to exposed hydrophobic patches of a protein. The hydrophobic patches are generally buried within the tertiary structure of a protein in its native state, but become exposed as a protein begins to unfold or denature. Examples of these small molecular, spectroscopic probes are aromatic, hydrophobic dyes, such as antrhacene, acridine, phenanthroline or the like. Other spectroscopic probes are metal-amino acid complexes, such as cobalt metal complexes of hydrophobic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine, or the like.<br>
The term "chemical stability" of the protein formulation as used herein refers to chemical covalent changes in the protein structure leading to formation of chemical degradation products with potential less biological potency and/or potential increased immunogenic properties compared to the native protein structure. Various chemical degradation products can be formed depending on the type and nature of the native protein and the environment to which the protein is exposed. Elimination of chemical degradation can most probably not be completely avoided and increasing amounts of chemical degradation products is often seen during storage and use of the protein formulation as well-known by the person skilled in the art. Most proteins are prone to deamidation, a process in which the side chain amide group in glutaminyl or asparaginyl residues is hydrolysed to form a free carboxylic acid. Other<br>
degradations pathways involves formation of high molecular weight transformation products where two or more protein molecules are covalently bound to each other through transamidation and/or disulfide interactions leading to formation of covalently bound dimer, oligomer and polymer degradation products (Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals, Ahern. T.J. &amp; Manning M.C., Plenum Press, New York 1992). Oxidation (of for instance methionine residues) can be mentioned as another variant of chemical degradation. The chemical stability of the protein formulation can be evaluated by measuring the amount of the chemical degradation products at various time-points after exposure to different environmental conditions (the formation of degradation products can often be accelerated by for instance increasing temperature). The amount of each individual degradation product is often determined by separation of the degradation products depending on molecule size and/or charge using various chromatography techniques (e.g. SEC-HPLC and/or RP-HPLC).<br>
Hence, as outlined above, a "stabilized formulation" refers to a formulation with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability. In general, a formulation must be stable during use and storage (in compliance with recommended use and storage conditions) until the expiration date is reached.<br>

A: Synthesis of resin bound peptide.<br>
The protected peptidyl resin was synthesized according to the Fmoc strategy on an Applied Biosystems 433 peptide synthesizer in 0.25 mmol or 1.0 mmol scale using the manufacturer supplied FastMoc UV protocols which employ HBTU ( 2-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl-)-1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) or HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) mediated couplings in NMP (N-methyl pyrrolidone), and UV monitoring of the deprotection of the Fmoc protection group. The starting resin used for the synthesis of the GLP-1 peptide amides was Rink-Amide resin and either Wang or chlorotrityl resin was used for GLP-1 peptides with a carboxy C-terminal. The protected amino acid derivatives used were standard Fmoc-amino acids (supplied from e.g. Anaspec, or Novabiochem) supplied in preweighed cartridges suitable for the ABI433A synthesizer with the exception of unnatural aminoacids such as Fmoc-Aib-OH (Fmoc-aminoisobutyric acid). The N terminal amino acid was Boc protected at the alpha amino group (e.g. Boc-His(Boc)OH was used for peptides with His at the N-terminal). The epsilon amino group of lysine in position 26 was either protected with Mtt, Mmt, Dde, ivDde, or Boc, depending on the route for attachment of the albumin binding moiety and spacer. The synthesis of the peptides may in some cases be improved by the use of dipeptides protected on the dipeptide amide bond with a group that can be cleaved under acidic conditions such but not limited to 2-Fmoc-oxy-4-methoxybenzyl or 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzyl. In cases where a serine or a threonine is present in the peptide, the use of pseudoproline dipeptides may be used (see e.g. catalogue from Novobiochem 2002/2003 or newer version, or W.R. Sampson (1999), J. Pep. Sci. 5, 403.<br>

ivDde group and wash with N-methyl pyrrolidone (4x20 ml).<br>
Procedure for removal of Mtt or Mmt-protection.<br>
The resin (0.25 mmol) was placed in a manual shaker/filtration apparatus and treated with 2% TFA and 2-3% TIS in DCM (20 ml, 5-10 min repeated 6-12 times) to remove the Mtt or Mmt group and wash with DCM (2x20 ml), 10%MeOH and 5% DIPEA in DCM (2x20ml) and N-methyl pyrrolidone (4x20 ml).<br>
Procedure for attachment of sidechains to Lysine residue.<br>
The albumin binding residue (B-U- sidechain of formula I) can be attached to the GLP-1 peptide either by acylation to resin bound peptide or acylation in solution to the unprotected peptide using standard acylating reagent such as but not limited to DIC, HOBt/DIC, HOAt/DIC, or HBTU.<br>
Attachment to resin bound peptide: Route I<br>
Activated (active ester or symmetric anhydride) albumin binding residue (B-U- sidechain of formula I) such as octadecanedioic acid mono-(2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl) ester (Ebashi et a/. EP511600, 4 molar equivalents relative to resin bound peptide) was dissolved in NMP (25 mL), added to the resin and shaken overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered and the resin was washed extensively with NMP, dichloromethane, 2-propanol, methanol and diethyl ether.<br>
Route II<br>
The albumin binding residue (B-U- sidechain of formula I) was dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidone/methylene chloride (1:1, 10 ml). The activating reagent such as hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (4 molar equivalents relative to resin) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (4 molar equivalents relative to resin) was added and the solution was stirred for 15 min. The solution was added to the resin and diisopropyethylamine (4 molar equivalents relative to resin) was added. The resin was shaken 2 to 24 hours at room temperature. The resin was washed with N-methyl pyrrolidone (2x20 ml), N-methyl pyrrolidone/Methylene chloride (1:1) (2x20ml) and methylene chloride (2x20 ml).<br>
Route III<br>

formula I) such as octadecanedioic acid mono-(2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl) ester (Ebashi et a/.<br>
EP511600,1-1.5 molar equivalents relative to the GLP-1 peptide was dissolved in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, THF, DMF, DMSO or in a mixture of water/organic solvent (1-2 ml) and added to a solution of the peptide in water (10-20ml) together with 10 molar equivalents of DIPEA. In case of protecting groups on the albumin binding residue such as tert.-butyl, the reaction mixture was lyophilized O/N and the isolated crude peptide deprotected afterwards - in case of a fe/t-butyl group the peptide was dissolved in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, water and triisopropylsilane (90:5:5). After for 30min the mixture was, evaporated in vacuo and the finale petide purified by preparative HPLC.<br>
Procedure for removal of Fmoc-protection: The resin (0.25 mmol) was placed in a filter flask in a manual shaking apparatus and treated with N-methyl pyrrolidone/methylene chloride (1:1) (2x20 ml) and with N-methyl pyrrolidone (1x20 ml), a solution of 20% piperidine in N-methyl pyrrolidone (3x20 ml, 10 min each). The resin was washed with N-methyl pyrrolidone (2x20 ml), N-methyl pyrrolidone/Methylene chloride (1:1) (2x20ml) and methylene chloride (2x20 ml).<br>
Procedure for cleaving the peptide off the resin:<br>
The peptide was cleaved from the resin by stirring for 180 min at room temperature with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, water and triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5 to 92:4:4). The cleavage mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to an oil by a stream of nitrogen. The crude peptide was precipitated from this oil with 45 ml diethyl ether and washed 1 to 3 times with 45 ml diethyl ether.<br>
Purification: The crude peptide was purified by semipreparative HPLC on a 20 mm x 250 mm column packed with either 5μ or 7μ C-18 silica. Depending on the peptide one or two purification systems were used.<br>
TFA: After drying the crude peptide was dissolved in 5 ml 50% acetic acid H2O and diluted to 20 ml with H2O and injected on the column which then was eluted with a gradient of 40-60 % CH3CN in 0.1% TFA 10 ml/min during 50 min at 40 °C. The peptide containing fractions were collected. The purified peptide was lyophilized after dilution of the eluate with water. Ammonium sulphate: The column was equilibrated with 40% CH3CN in 0.05M (NH4)2SO4, which was adjusted to pH 2.5 with concentrated H2SO4. After drying the crude peptide was dissolved in 5 ml 50% acetic acid H2O and diluted to 20 ml with H2O and injected on the column which then was eluted with a gradient of 40% - 60% CH3CN in 0.05M (NH4)2SO4 pH 2.5 at 10 ml/min during 50 min at 40 °C. The peptide containing fractions were collected and diluted with 3 volumes of H2O and passed through a Sep-Pak® C18 cartridge (Waters part.<br>
#:51910 ) which has been equilibrated with 0.1% TFA. It was then eluted with 70% CH3CN<br>

The peptide was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry on a Liberty Microwave Peptide Synthesizer (CEM Corporation). The synthesis was performed on a Gly-Wang resin (Novabiochem) with a loading of 0.66 mmol/g using 4 fold excess of amino acids and DIC/HOAt for coupling. The N-terminal histidine was Boc-protected and the lysine to be modified was Mtt-protected. After synthesis of the peptide backbone, the Mtt group was removed with 3% TFA in DCM and the side chain was built on the Liberty using standard peptide synthesis protocols. In the last step the fatty diacid was added as a mono-t-butyl-ester.<br>
After cleavage with TFA/TIS/water (95:2.5:2.5), the peptide was dissolved in 50% acetonitrile by addition of DIPEA and purified on a Waters LC-MS system using a 7.8 x 300 mm X-Terra Prep MS C18 10 pm column running at room temperature. After 5 minutes at 30% CH3CN, 0.08% TFA, 4 ml/min, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 30 to 70% CH3CN over 40 minutes. The fractions containing the desired compound were collected and the concentration of the peptide in the eluate was determined by measurement of the UV absorption at 280 nm assuming molar extinction coefficients of 1280 and 3690 for tyrosine and tryptophan respectively. The identity and purity was confirmed by MALDI. After the concentration determination the eluate was aliquotted into vials containing the desired amount and dried by vacuum centrifugation.<br>

Pharmacodynamic study using db/db mice<br>
In one aspect of this invention the GLP-1 agonists have a duration of action of at least 24hrs<br>
after dosing of 30nmol/kg to db/db mice<br>
The efficacy and duration of action are measured in db/db mice.<br>
Male db/db mice are shipped from laconic, Denmark at the age of 8-10 weeks. From the<br>
time of arrival, the mice are housed under standard conditions but at 24 °C. The mice are<br>
kept  10 per cage until experimentation with free access to standard chow (Altromin,<br>
Brogaarden APS., Denmark) and tap water at a normal day: light cycle (light on at 6 am).<br>
The mice are used for 1 experiment per week for 3 weeks. After this, the mice are<br>
euthanized.<br>
After an acclimatisation period of 1 week, the blood glucose is measured by sampling from<br>
the tail tip capillary. In brief, 5 μl blood is sampled in heparinised glass capillary tubes and<br>
immediately suspended in 250 μl EBIO buffer solution (Eppendorf, Germany) in an 1.5 ml<br>
Eppendorf tube. The blood glucose concentration is measured by the glucose oxidase<br>
method at the EBIO Plus Auto analyser (Eppendorf, Germany).<br>
The cut of value for blood glucose is 10 mM. When evaluating the mice, it is essential, that all<br>
42 mice entering the experiment have blood glucose values above 10 mM, but also that the<br>
inter-mice variance is small. Therefore, if many mice are not severely diabetic, whereas<br>
some are, the start up of experiments should be postponed one week and new basal blood<br>
glucose measurements be made.<br>
Based on the basal blood glucose values, the mice are allocated to 7 groups of n=6 with<br>
matching group mean blood glucose values.<br>
On the day of testing the basal blood glucose morning values are assessed as described<br>
above and the basal body weight of each mouse is assessed. A time 0, the compound is<br>
dosed subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck (dosing volume app. 300 Ml/50 g mouse).<br>
The blood glucose values are followed up to 48 hours (time 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h) and the<br>
terminal body weight is assessed.<br>
All data are entered into Graphpad Prism where mean blood glucose and mean delta body<br>
weights are calculated.<br>
One aspect of this invention is to prepare GLP-1 analogues/derivatives with extended plasma half-lives that are suitable for once weekly administration. The pharmaco kinetic properties can be evaluated in mini pigs or domestic pigs as described below<br>
Pharmacokinetic screening of once weekly 6LP-1 analogues<br>
Pharmacokinetic screening of GLP-1 analogues for identification of suitable once weekly candidates were performed on candidates that according to the project screenings plan were shown to be sufficiently potent with respect to glucose lowering potential in a diabetic mouse model (db/db mice) and subsequently had a time of duration of 48 hours or more in the db/db mouse model.<br>
Primary screening<br>
The first part of the pharmacokinetic screening consisted of a single dose subcutaneous administration of 2 nmol/kg to three minipigs weighing 8-12 kg. Blood samples were drawn from each animal at predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-injection. All blood samples were stabilised with a special stabilisation buffer consisting of: EDTA (di-sodium) 0.18 M, Aprotenin 15000 KIE/ml, Val-Pyr 0.30 mM, pH adjusted to 7.4 in order to prevent enzymatic degradation of the GLP-1 analogues. Plasma was collected from each stabilised blood samples by centrifugation (4°C, 10 min., 1270 G (4000 rpm), and analysed for the content of GLP-1 analogue by ELISA assays. Three different ELISA assays were used for the plasma analysis: "The "Total assay" using the antibody combination F1/Ra2135 detecting both the N-terminally intact 7-37GLP-1 molecule and the N-terminal enzymatically degraded 9-37GLP-1 molecule with a limit of detection (LOD) of 35 pM and a dynamic analytical range of 35-30000 pM. The "Intact assay" using the antibody combination F1/Mab26.1. This assay was detecting the N-terminally intact 7-37GLP-1 molecule only. The LOD was 35 pM and a dynamic analytical range of 35-30000 pM. The "Aib-intact assay" using the antibody combination F1/GLP162-3F15. This assay was detecting the Aib stabilised N-terminal of the GLP-1 molecule enabling detection of stabilised GLP-1 analogues. The LOD was 45 pM and the dynamic analytical range 45-30000 pM.<br>
All plasma concentration-time profiles were analysed pharmacokinetically by a non-compartmental analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated if data permitted: tmax, Cmax, AUC, AUC/Dose, AUC./oExtrapol, Az, t1/2, CL/F, VZ/F and MRT.<br>
Secondary screening<br>
A second part of the pharmacokinetic screening was conducted on those compounds with an initial terminal half-life of 60-70 hours or more. This screening consisted of a single dose intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 2 nmol/kg to six minipigs for each route of administration. The blood sampling schedule was extended from 0-120 hours to 0-432 and 0-504 hours after intravenous and subcutaneous administration respectively. This was done in order to increase the precision and accuracy of the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates, especially the terminal half-life, AUC and the derived parameters clearance and volume of distribution, and to estimate the bioavailability after subcutaneous administration.<br>
GLP-1 (AIB8- INTACT) ASSAY<br>
The assay was a two-site assay with simultaneous incubation of the analyte with catcher and detector antibody. A ready to use chemiluminescent substrate was used to maximize signal. The assay neither recognizes endogen GLP-1 (7-37) nor the DPPIV cleaved GLP-1 (9-37).<br>
