				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to the purification of industrially important enzyme such as Penicillin G acylase. More particularly it relates to the process for the purification of penicillin G acylase from crude enzyme extract of Escherichia coli using derivatised macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers. The purification achieved is effected in a single operation by the process of this invention and high yields are obtained.<br>
Penicillin G acylase finds applications as a biocatalyst in the preparation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and 7-amino desacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA). 6-APA and 7-ADCA are further processed for the production of semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins those are potent antimicrobial agents. These applications are developed due to absolute specificity of penicillin G acylase in hydrolysing linear amide bond present in penicillins and cephalosporins to form corresponding beta-lactam nuclei.<br>
Penicillin G acylase is used as an immobilized enzyme preparation. The protocol for preparation of immobilised penicillin G acylase constitutes fermentation of a microorganism producing penicillin G acylase (usualy Escherichia coli), extraction of the penicillin G acylase from the cells into aqueous extract, purification of the penicillin G acylase and immobilisation of the purified enzyme onto a solid support. The specific activity of the immobilised penicillin G acylase is determined by the degree of purity of the enzyme used for immobilisation. Thus, purification of penicillin G acylase is an important operation in the production of immobilised penicillin G acylase.<br>
Different protocols are developed for purification of penicillin G acylase involves use of ion exchange, hydrophobic interactions and/or affinity chromatography either individually or in various combinations as described in Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology vol.9, p. 573, 1984. Sepharose (agarose) activated with cyanogen bromide and derivatised with some amino acids, • aromatic amines, aliphatic amines, ampicillin and amoxycillin are used for purification of penicillin G acylase as described in Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, vol. 9, p. 421, 1984; Biotechnology Letters, vol. 9, p. 539, 1987 and Hindustan Antibiotics Bulletin, vol. 31.P2571989.<br>
These protocols for purification of penicillin G acylase suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages; use of column chromatography procedures, bed compression, attrition of the chromatography support when used in batch mode.<br><br>
In our copending application No.1059/DEL/2000 we have described and claimed a process for the<br>
preparation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers.<br>
In our another copending application No.1059/DEL/2000 we have described and claimed a process for the derivatization of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers by binding of dyes as the ligands useful as affinity supports for purification of penicillin G acylase.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a process for the purification of penicillin G acylase from enzyme extract of Escherichia coli using derivatised macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers.<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop a process, which is simple , rapid an does not involve many steps.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process by which purified penicillin G acylase preparation is useful for its immobilization onto solid supports.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for purification of penicillin G acylase from crude enzyme extract, which comprises suspending the derivatized macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers as described herein , in a crude enzyme extract from Escherichia coli cells prepared in phosphate buffer having a molarity ranging between; 0.02 to 1 M , at a pH ranging from 7 to 8, agitating the suspension for a period of 30 minutes at a temperature 25 °C at a rpm of 1100, filtering the suspension to get beads having adsorbed penicillin G acylase , washing the beads with phosphate buffer having molarity ranging between 0.02 to 1 M containing 0.5 M of phenylacetic acid to elute the adsorbed penicillin G acylase, dialyzing the eluted solution containing penicillin G acylase by conventional methods to get desired purified penicillin G acylase .<br>
Penicillin G acylase and total protein content in the enzyme extract used was 5 IU/ml and 2 mg/ml, respectively.  Thus, the specific activity of penicillin G acylase in the enzyme extract was 2.5 IU/mg.   The enzyme activity was determined using penicillin G as substrate as described in Hindustan Antibiotics Bulletin Vol.   20, p. 80, 1978.   Protein was determined as described in-Journal of Biological Chemistry vol. 193, pp.265, 1951.<br>
