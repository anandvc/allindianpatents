Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to wireless (radio) communications, and in particular,<br>
to handling data blocks by updating a next-expected TSN and receiver window to<br>
avoid stall conditions.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The present invention relates to controlling a reordering buffer by a user equipment<br>
(UE) that employs a next-expected transmission sequence number (TSN) and a<br>
receiver window for a HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) system in a<br>
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), which is a European type<br>
IMT-2000 system, and more particularly, to controlling the reordering buffer to<br>
prevent stall conditions due to MAC-hs PDUs not being delivered to the upper layer<br>
when the next-expected TSN Ms outside the receiver window range.<br>
[3]	The UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) is a third generation<br>
mobile communications system that evolved from the European GSM (Global System<br>
for Mobile Communications) system, with the purpose of providing farther improved<br>
mobile communications service based upon a GSM core network and W-CDMA<br>
(Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) technology.<br>
[4]	Figure 1 depicts a typical UMTS network (100) architecture. The UMTS broadly<br>
consists of user equipment (UE 110), a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network<br>
(UTRAN120), and a core network (CN130). The UTRAN consists of one or more<br>
radio network sub-systems (RNS 121,122), and each RNS consists of one radio<br>
network controller (RNC 123,124) and one or more base stations (Node Bs 125,126)<br>
mat are managed by the RNC The Node B, being managed by the RNC, receives data<br>
sent from a physical layer of the UE via the uplink and transmits data to the UE via the<br>
downlink, to thus act as an access point of the UTRAN with respect to the UE The <br>
RNC handles the allocation and management of radio resources, and acts as an access<br>
point with the CN.<br>
[5]	An RNC that manages dedicated radio resources for a particular UE is called a<br>
serving RNC (SRNC 123), and an RNC that manages common radio resources for a<br>
plurality of UEs within one cell is called a controlling RNC (CRNC). Also, when the<br>
UE moves, all RNCs that the UE goes through (excluding the SRNC) are called drift<br><br>
RNCs (DRNCs 124). The drift RNCs 124 facilitate the routing of user data and<br>
allocate codes as common resources.<br>
[6]	The interface between the RNC and the CN is called an Iu interface. The interface<br>
between the SRNC and the DRNC is called an Iur interface. The interface between the<br>
RNC and Node B is called an Iub interface. Each interface provides control data or<br>
data transmission services via a transport bearer. For example, the bearer provided in<br>
the Iub interface is called a Iub transport bearer, which provides control data or data<br>
transmission services between the RNC and Node B.<br>
[7]	Figure 2 depicts a radio interface protocol architecture based upon a 3GPP radio<br>
access network specification between the UE and the UTRAN. The radio interface<br>
protocol of Figure 2 is divided horizontally into a physical layer, a data link layer, and<br>
a network layer, and is divided vertically into a user plane for data information<br>
transmissions and a control plane for transfer of control signaling. Namely, the user<br>
plane is the region in which traffic information of the user (such as voice, IP (Internet<br>
Protocol) packets, and the like) is transferred, while the control plane is the region in<br>
which control information (such as the interface of the network, maintaining and<br>
managing calls, and the like) is transferred. The protocol layers of Figure 2 may be<br>
divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based upon<br>
the lower three layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) model that is a well-<br>
known in communications systems. <br>
[8]	Each layer depicted in Figure 2 will now be described in more detail. The first layer<br>
(L1) is a physical layer (PHY) that provides information transfer service to upper<br>
layers by using various radio transmission techniques, and is connected to a medium<br>
access control (MAC) layer that is located thereabove via a transport channel through<br>
which data travels between the MAC layer and the physical layer.<br>
[9]	The MAC layer provides data transfer, reallocation of radio resources and MAC<br>
parameters. The MAC layer is connected to a radio link control (RLC) layer, which is<br>
an upper layer, via a logical channel, and various logical channels are provided<br>
depending upon the type of data that is transmitted.<br>
[10]	In general, when information of the control plane is transmitted, a control channel is<br>
used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a traffic channel is used.<br>
[11]	The MAC layer is sub-divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer (310), a<br>
MAC-c/sb sub-layer (320), and a MAC-hs sub-layer (330), according to the type of<br>
transport channel that is managed.<br>
[ 12]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport<br><br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information.<br>
[13]	The MAC-d sub-layer (310) manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a<br>
dedicated transport channel for a specific terminal. Accordingly, the MAC-d sub-layer<br>
of the UTRAN is located in a serving radio network controller (SRNC) that manages a<br>
corresponding terminal, and one MAC-d sub-layer also exists within each UE<br>
[14]	The MAC-c/sh sub-layer (320) manages a common transport channel, such as a<br>
forward access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is<br>
shared by a plurality of terminals. In the UTRAN, the MAC-c/sh sub-layer exists for<br>
each cell and is located in a controlling radio network controller (CRNC), and one<br>
MAC-c/sh sub-layer exists in each UE<br>
[ 15]	The MAC-hs sub-layer (330) performs the functions related to HSDPA<br>
(High-Speed Data Packet Access) such as packet scheduling, HARQ (Hybrid ARQ)<br>
operations, and the like.<br>
[16]	The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions, and performs a segmentation<br>
and concatenation function on a plurality of RLC service data units (RLC SDUs)<br>
delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the<br>
upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner<br>
upon considering processing capacity, and then creates certain data units with header<br>
information added thereto. The created data units are called protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), which are men transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel.'The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[17]	The BMC (Broadcast/Multicast Control) layer is located above the RLC layer, and<br>
schedules cell broadcast messages (referred to as 'CB messages', hereinafter) received<br>
from the core network, and broadcasts the CB messages to UEs located in a specific<br>
cell(s).<br>
[18]	The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer is located above the RLC<br>
layer, and allows the data transmitted through a network protocol (such as an IPv4 or<br>
IPv6) to be effectively transmitted on a radio interface with a relatively small<br>
bandwidth. To achieve this, the PDCP layer performs the function of reducing un-<br>
necessary control information used for a wire-line network, and this type of function is<br>
called, header compression.<br>
[ 19]	There is a radio resource control (RRC) layer at a lowermost portion of the L3<br>
layer. The RRC layer is defined only in the control plane, and handles the controlling<br>
of logical channels, transport channels, and physical channels with respect to es-<br>
tablishment, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers (RBs). The radio bearer<br><br>
service refers to a service that the second layer (L2) provides for data transmission<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN in order to guarantee a predetermined quality of<br>
service by the UE and UTRAN. And in general, the radio bearer (RB) establishment<br>
refers to regulating the protocol layers and the channel characteristics of the channels<br>
required for providing a specific service, as well as respectively setting substantial<br>
parameters and operation methods.<br>
[20]	When the RRC layer of a particular UE and that of the UTRAN are connected to<br>
allow RRC messages to be sent and received therebetween, that UE is said to be in<br>
RRC connected state. If there is no such connection, that UE is said to be in idle state.<br>
[21]	The HSDPA system is based on WCDMA, supports a maximum speed of 10 Mbps,<br>
and provides shorter delay times and improved capacity compared to existing systems.<br>
[22]	Figure 3 shows a radio interface protocol structure for supporting a HSDPA system.<br>
A terminal (UE) and a network (UTRAN) respectively contain corresponding protocol<br>
layers. For example, the MAC layer is divided into a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC c/sh<br>
sub-layer, and a MAC-hs sub-layer. At the network, the MAC-hs sub-layer can be<br>
positioned above the physical layer (PHY) of a Node B (base station). The MAC-c/sh<br>
and the MAC-d sub-layers are located in the CRNC and the SRNC, respectively. A<br>
new transmission protocol called the HS-DSCH frame protocol (FP) is used between<br>
the RNC and the Node B, or among the RNCs for the delivery of HSDPA data.<br>
[23] Figure 4 also shows a more detailed terminal side MAC architecture for supporting<br>
the HSDPA system. As shown, the MAC layer is divided into a MAC-d sub-layer<br>
(310), a MAC-c/sh sub-layer (320), and a MAC-hs sub-layer (330).<br>
[24]	The manner in which the MAC layer receives the data from the physical layer and<br>
delivers it to the RLC layer will now be described. The data block (MAC-hs PDU)<br>
delivered to the MAC-hs sub-layer (330) through the HS-DSCH (High-Speed<br>
Downlink Shared Channel) is first stored in one of the HARQ processes within the<br>
HARQ block (331). In which process the data block is stored can be known from the<br>
HARQ process identifier included in the downlink control signal.<br>
[25]	The HARQ process, in which the data block is stored, transmits the NACK<br>
(Negative Acknowledgement) to the UTRAN when there are errors in the data block<br>
and requests the re-transmission of the data block. When no errors exist, the HARQ<br>
process delivers the data block to a reordering buffer (shown in Figure 5) and transmits<br>
the ACK (Acknowledgement) to the UTRAN. The reordering queue distribution block<br>
(333) and the reordering blocks (334,335) are employed to handle the data blocks<br>
delivered to the reordering buffer.<br><br>
[26]	Multiple reordering buffers can exist per priority level. The HARQ process delivers<br>
the data block to the corresponding reordering buffer by using the Queue ID (identity)<br>
included in the data block. A significant characteristic of the reordering buffer is that it<br>
supports in-sequence delivery of data.<br>
[27]	Data blocks are sequentially delivered to an upper layer based on a transmission<br>
sequence number (TSN). More specifically, when a data block is received while one or<br>
more previous data blocks are missing, the data block is stored in the reordering buffer<br>
and is not delivered to the upper layer. Rather, the stored data block is delivered to the<br>
upper layer only when all previous data blocks are received and delivered to the upper<br>
layer. The TSN is 6 bits in length and modulo operations are performed.<br>
[28]	Typically, because several HARQ processes operate, a reordering buffer may<br>
receive data blocks out of sequence. Therefore, a reordering buffer must be employed<br>
so that the data blocks can be delivered to the upper layer in sequence.<br>
[29]	When the data blocks (MAC-hs PDUs) are delivered to the upper layer, they are<br>
sent to a disassembly block (336,337). This disassembly block disassembles the<br>
MAC-hs PDU (formed by a plurality of MAC-d PDUs combined together) and thus<br>
performs segmentation into MAC-d PDUs. Thereafter, the disassembly block delivers<br>
the corresponding MAC-d PDUs to the MAC-d sub-layer (310). A transport channel<br>
multiplexing block (312) in the MAC-d sub-layer (310) refers to the logical channel<br>
identifier (C/T field) included in each MAC-d PDU to deliver the MAC-d PDU to the<br>
RLC layer via the corresponding logical channel.<br>
[30]	Figure 5 depicts an exemplary transmission and reception procedure in a general<br>
HSDPA system. Here, the MAC-d PDU is actually stored in the transmission buffer,<br>
but for the sake of explanation, a MAC-hs PDU (= one or more MAC-d PDUs) is<br>
depicted. Also, the size of each MAC-hs PDU may be different, but are conceptually<br>
depicted to be of equal size Additionally, it is assumed mat there are eight (8) HARQ<br>
processes.<br>
[31]	In more detail, Figure 5 depicts the procedures of transmission to the receiving side<br>
(receiver) when MAC-hs PDU with TSN=13 through TSN=22 are stored in the<br>
transmission buffer. First, the MAC-hs PDUs with relatively low TSN values are<br>
delivered to an empty HARQ process. Here, the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=13 being<br>
delivered to HARQ process #1, and the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=14 being delivered to<br>
HARQ process #8 are shown by way of example. Namely, the TSN is not related to<br>
the HARQ process number, and delivery to any empty HARQ process is performed.<br>
[32]	When the HARQ process receives an arbitrary data block (MAC-hs PDU), the<br><br>
HARQ process transmits the data block to the receiving side in a specific TTI<br>
(transmission time interval) and stores the data block for re-transmission that might be<br>
performed later. Only one data block can be transmitted in a certain TTI. Accordingly,<br>
only one HARQ process is activated in a single TTI. The HARQ process that<br>
transmitted the data block informs the receiving side of its process number through a<br>
downlink control signal which is transmitted through a different channel than that of<br>
the data block.<br>
[33]	The reason for matching the HARQ process of the transmitting side (transmitter)<br>
with the HARQ process of the receiving side is because a stop-and-wait ARQ method<br>
is used by each HARQ process pair. That is, HARQ process #1 that transmitted MAC-<br>
hs PDU with TSN=13 does not transmit another data block until this data block is suc-<br>
cessfully transmitted. Because a receiving side HARQ process #1 can know that data is<br>
transmitted thereto for a corresponding TTI through the downlink control signal, the<br>
receiving side HARQ process #1 transmits the NACK to the transmitting side through<br>
an uplink control signal when the data block is not successfully received within a<br>
defined transmission time interval (TTI). In contrast, when a data block is successfully<br>
received, the receiving side HARQ process #1 transmits the ACK to the transmitting<br>
side, and at the same time delivers the corresponding data block to the reordering<br>
buffer according to the priority (Queue ID).<br>
[34]	The multiple reordering buffers can exist per priority level. The HARQ process<br>
checks the priority (Queue ID) included in the MAC-hs PDU and delivers this MAC-<br>
hs PDU to the reordering buffer according to the priority. The data block delivered to<br>
the reordering buffer is then delivered to the upper layer when all of the previous data<br>
blocks are successfully received. However, when one or more previous data blocks are<br>
not successfully received and delivered to the upper layer, the data block is stored in<br>
the reordering buffer. That is, the reordering buffer must support in-sequence delivery<br>
of data blocks to the upper layer. A data block that is not delivered to the upper layer is<br>
stored in the reordering buffer.<br>
[35]	To illustrate the foregoing, Figure 5 shows that when the MAC-hs PDU with<br>
TSN=14 is received but the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=13 is not received, the MAC-hs<br>
PDU with TSN=14 is stored in the reordering buffer (420) until the MAC-hs PDU with<br>
TSN=13 is received. When the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=13 is received, both data<br>
blocks are delivered to the upper layer in the order of TSN=13 and TSN=14. When the<br>
data blocks are delivered to the upper layer, they are disassembled in units of MAC-d<br>
PDUs and are delivered as described above.<br><br>
[36]	However, during the transmission of data via radio (wireless) channels, certain<br>
PDUs may not be properly delivered from the UTRAN to the UE despite numerous re-<br>
transmissions. Particular MAC-hs PDUs that that are not delivered for a prolonged<br>
period of time causes the problems of degrading transmission efficiency of the HSDPA<br>
system. That is, although the HSDPA system was developed for high speed data com-<br>
munications, if one MAC-hs PDU is not properly received for a long time or<br>
permanently, this causes many subsequent MAC-hs PDUs remain in the MAC-hs<br>
buffer for a prolonged period of time without delivery, and thus the overall data<br>
transmission efficiency deteriorates and undermines the reasons for employing a<br>
HSDPA system.<br>
[37]	In order to prevent the stalling of the MAC-hs PDUs, the HSDPA has adopted a<br>
stall avoidance method employing a window technique.<br>
[38]	Before explaining the window-based stall avoiding method, the operation en-<br>
vironment parameters used for the reordering buffer will first be explained.<br>
[39]	The next-expected TSN (referred to as NET hereafter) refers to the immediately<br>
subsequent value after the TSN of the last PDU of the sequentially received MAC-hs<br>
PDUs. Namely, the NET refers to the TSN of the first MAC-hs PDU to be sub-<br>
sequently received in-sequence. Whenever a PDU having a TSN that equals the NET<br>
is received, the NET is updated. The initial NET value is set to zero (0).<br>
[40]	The end point of the receive window (RcvWindow_UpperEdge) refers to the largest<br>
TSN value in the receive window of the reordering buffer. When a MAC-hs PDU first<br>
arrives at the receiving side, the end point (i.e., upper edge) is set as the value cor-<br>
responding to the largest TSN among those of the received PDUs. The initial value of<br>
the upper edge of the receive window is set to 63.<br>
[41 ]	The start point of the receiver window (RcvWindow_LowerEdge) refers to the<br>
smallest TSN value in the receiver window of the reordering buffer. The start point<br>
(i.e., lower edge) of the receiver window can be calculated by subtracting the receiver<br>
window size from the end point of the receiver window and adding 1 thereto<br>
(RcvWindow_LowerEdge = RcvWindow_UpperEdge - receiver window size + 1).<br>
[42]	The receiver window prescribes (regulates) the TSN values of the MAC-hs PDUs<br>
that may be received when the window position does not change. The receiver window<br>
includes the TSN values from the lower edge to the upper edge of the receiver<br>
window.<br>
[43]	The size of the receiver window (Receive_Window_Size) refers to the range of the<br>
receiver window, and is established by an upper layer of the MAC entity.<br><br>
[44]	In a window based stall avoidance method, the receiving side moves (updates) the<br>
receiver window upon receiving a MAC-hs PDU having a TSN that is larger than the<br>
RcvWindow_UpperEdge. For those MAC-hs PDUs with a TSN that is smaller than the<br>
RcvWindow_LowerEdge of the updated receiver window, the receiving side no longer<br>
waits (i.e., ends reception stand-by) for those MAC-hs PDUs that have not yet been<br>
received and the MAC-hs PDUs previously received and stored in the reordering<br>
buffer are delivered (transferred) to the upper layers, such that stall situations for the<br>
MAC-hs PDUs can be prevented.<br>
[45]	Figure 6 depicts a more detailed operation, which can be summarized as follows:<br>
[46]	In step 510, a MAC-hs PDU with a transmission sequence number (TSN) having<br>
the sequence number (SN) (= a random number) value is received.<br>
[47]	In step 520, the SN value is compared with the receiver window range, and if the<br>
SN value is within the range, the following step 230 is performed, but if outside the<br>
range, the following step 522 is performed.<br>
[48]	In step 530, when the SN value falls within the receiver window range, this SN<br>
value is compared with the NET, and it is checked as to whether the MAC-hs PDU<br>
corresponding to this SN had been previously received. If this SN is smaller than the<br>
NET or if the MAC-hs PDU corresponding to this SN had been previously received,<br>
the received MAC-hs PDU (in step 510) is discarded (step 540). If this SN equals to or<br>
is greater than the NET, and if the MAC-hs PDU corresponding to this SN had not<br>
been previously received, the corresponding MAC-hs PDU is stored in the location<br>
indicated by the SN value (step 550). Then, the following step 560 is performed.<br>
[49]	In previous step 520, if the SN value falls outside the receiver window range, the<br>
following steps (steps 522-528) are sequentially performed: The received MAC-hs<br>
PDU is stored in the reordering buffer at a location indicated by the SN value that is<br>
greater than the RcvWindowJLJpperEdge, and the RcvWindcw.UpperEdge value is<br>
updated to the SN value. Then, among the MAC-hs PDUs stored in the reordering<br>
buffer, those MAC-hs PDUs having a TSN value that is smaller than the<br>
RcvWindow_LowerEdge are delivered from the reordering buffer to a disassembly<br>
block. Also, the NET is updated to be the RcvWindow_LowerEdge, and the following<br>
step 560 is performed.<br>
[50]	In step 560, all the MAC-hs PDUs starting from the MAC-hs PDU having a<br>
TSN=NET and up to the MAC-hs PDU that immediately precedes the first MAC-hs<br>
PDU that has not been received, are delivered to the disassembly block. Here, "the first<br>
MAC-hs PDU that has not been received" refers to the MAC-hs PDU having the<br><br>
smallest TSN among all the not received MAC-hs PDUs having a TSN that is equal to<br>
or greater than the NET.<br>
[51]	In step 570, the NET is updated to equal the TSN of the first not received MAC-hs<br>
PDU of the previous step 560.<br>
[52]	According to the related art stall avoidance method using a window, the receiving<br>
side sets the NET value to 0 at the first initialization stage and the receiver window<br>
upper edge is set to 60L Thus, assuming that if the receiver window size is 32, based<br>
upon the definition of the receiver window, the initial receiver window is determined<br>
to have TSN values from 32 to 63. For the first MAC-hs PDU transmitted from the<br>
transmitting side, the TSN is set to 0 and for subsequently transmitted MAC-hs PDUs,<br>
the TSN values of 1,2,3, etc. will be sequentially used. If mere are no losses in the<br>
radio (wireless) region, the very first MAC-hs PDU arriving at the receiving side<br>
would have a PDU with TSN=0.<br>
[53]	However, because this MAC-hs PDU is located outside the receiver window<br>
defined previously, the receiving side advances the receiver window according to the<br>
TSN of the MAC-hs PDU. Thus, according to Figure 6, the re-established (updated)<br>
receiver window is set to have a TSN from 33 to 0. Also, even though the receiving<br>
side actually expects to receive a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=1 (i.e., NET=1), there is a<br>
problem with the related art because the NET will be set to 33.<br>
[54]	Additionally, an even greater problem occurs because even though a received<br>
MAC-hs PDU can be immediately delivered to the upper layer, such MAC-hs PDUs<br>
are not delivered to the upper disassembly block, but are accumulated in the reordering<br>
buffer, thus causing unnecessary delivery delays. Here, in order to deliver the MAC-hs<br>
PDU to the upper layer, all of the MAC-hs PDUs having a TSN that is smaller than the<br>
receiver window lower edge value (i.e., those MAC-hs PDUs with TSN=33 through<br>
63) must be received, or alternatively, if the receiver window is moved due to a sub-<br>
sequently received MAC-hs-PDU, and the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=0 must be located<br>
at a point smaller (less) than the receiver window lower edge. This situation will also<br>
occur whenever a MAC-hs PDU having a relatively small TSN (such as TSN=0,1,2,<br>
3, etc.) arrives at the receiving side during the initial operation of the receiver window.<br>
Accordingly, those MAC-hs PDUs that are sequentially received and that can be<br>
delivered to the upper layer unnecessarily remain in the reordering buffer to thus cause<br>
undesirable delivery delay situations.<br>
[55]	Such unnecessary delivery delay situations do not only occur during the initial<br>
stages of HSDPA system operation.<br><br>
[56]	If all the MAC-hs PDUs falling within the receiver window were properly<br>
received, the receiver window does not move and the NET is updated to be<br>
RcvWindow_UpperEdge + 1. When the NET refers to RcvWindow_UpperEdge + 1,<br>
and a MAC-hs PDU with NET= RcvWindow_UpperEdge + 1 arrives at the receiving<br>
side, the receiving side newly adjusts the receiver window range (because this MAC-<br>
hs PDU falls outside the current receiver window range) such that the NET is updated<br>
to RcvWindowJLowerEdge, and this received MAC-hs PDU is stored in the<br>
reordering buffer. Even though this PDU was sequentially received and can thus be<br>
immediately delivered to the upper layer, the receiver window operation according to<br>
the related art does not deliver this MAC-hs PDU to the disassembly block, but stores<br>
it in the reordering buffer, causing an unnecessary delivery delay situation.<br>
[57]	The above problematic situation is caused by the NET value being outside the<br>
receiver window. Also, the previously explained problem during the initial operation at<br>
the receiving side is caused by the NET value being outside the receiver window,<br>
whereby NET=0 but the receiver window range is set as TSN=32 to 63.<br>
[58]	Whenever the NET value falls outside the receiver window, the receiving side<br>
stores the received MAC-hs PDU in the reordering buffer even though such may be<br>
immediately delivered to the upper layer, resulting in a delay in delivering the MAC-hs<br>
PDU. [59]	Such delivery delays cause errors in the upper layer and/or result in severe service<br>
quality degradation.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[60]	A gist of the present invention involves the recognition by the present inventors of<br>
the drawbacks in the related art. Namely, the present invention has been developed to<br>
address and/or solve the problems of the related art, such that the NET value always<br>
falls within the receiver window to prevent unnecessary delivery delays of MAC-hs<br>
PDUs that occur in the related art, in order to achieve rapid data transmission ca-<br>
pabilities for a HSDPA system.<br>
[61]	To achieve this, the present invention adjusts the initial range of the receiver<br>
window such that the NET falls within the receiver window from the start of protocol<br>
operations. If the NET or receiver window is updated and the NET falls outside the<br>
receiver window, the NET or receiver window is re-updated such that the NET again<br>
falls within the receiver window. More specifically, the initial value of the receiver<br>
window upper edge is not set to be 63, but changed to 0 (such as the NET value) such<br><br>
that the NET falls within the receiver window range. Also, upon updating of the<br>
receiver window, if the NET value becomes smaller than the receiver window lower<br>
edge, the NET is re-updated to the TSN value of the receiver window lower edge, and<br>
if the NET value becomes larger man the receiver window upper edge, the NET is re-<br>
updated to the TSN value of the receiver window upper edge.<br>
[62]	Here, it should be noted that if the NET becomes greater man the receiver window<br>
upper edge due to the initial protocol operation or upon NET updating, the non-<br>
limiting exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides that the receiver<br>
window upper edge is to be set as the NET. However, this is not mandatory, as the<br>
receiver window may be updated to various appropriate positions as long as the NET<br>
falls within the receiver window range. Namely, the setting of the receiver window<br>
upper edge to equal the NET is merely one example, as me receiver window lower<br>
edge may be set as the NET, and other values within the receiver window range may<br>
also be set as the NET.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[73]	The present invention is described as being implemented in a W-CDMA mobile<br>
communications system. However, the present invention may also be adapted and im-<br>
plemented in communications systems operating under other types of communications.<br>
[74]	A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present invention is depicted in<br>
Figure 7, which is an improvement over the related art procedures shown in Figure 6<br>
[75]	In step 610, a MAC-hs PDU with a transmission sequence number (TSN) having<br>
the sequence number (SN) (= a random number) value is received.<br>
[76]	In step 620, the SN value is compared with the receiver window range, and if the<br>
SN value is within the range, the following step 630 is performed, but if outside the<br>
range, the following step 622 is performed.<br>
[77]	In step 630, when the SN value falls within the receiver window range, this SN<br>
value is compared with the NET, and it is checked as to whether the MAC-hs PDU<br>
corresponding to this SN had been previously received. If this SN is smaller than the<br>
NET or if the MAC-hs PDU corresponding to this SN had been previously received,<br>
the received MAC-hs PDU (in step 610) is discarded (step 640). If this SN equals to or<br>
is greater than the NET, and if the MAC-hs PDU corresponding to this SN had not<br>
been previously received, the corresponding MAC-hs PDU is stored in the reordering<br>
buffer at a location indicated by the SN value (step 650). Then, the following step 660<br>
is performed.<br>
[78]	In previous step 620, if the SN value falls outside the receiver window range, the<br>
following steps (622-628) are sequentially performed: The received MAC-hs PDU is<br>
stored in the reordering buffer at a location indicated by the SN value that is greater<br>
than the RcvWindow_UpperEdge, and the RcvWindow_UpperEdge value is updated<br>
to the SN. Then, among the MAC-hs PDUs stored in the reordering buffer, those<br>
MAC-hs PDUs having a TSN that is smaller than the RcvWindow_LowerEdge arc<br>
delivered from the reordering buffer to a disassembly block. Also, the NET is<br>
compared with the RcvWindowJLowerEdge, and the NET is updated to be the<br>
RcvWindow_LowerEdge only when the NET is smaller than the<br>
RcvWindowJLowerEdge, and then the following step 660 is performed.<br>
[79]	In step 660, all the MAC-hs PDUs starting from the MAC-hs PDU having a<br>
TSN=NET and up to the MAC-hs PDU that immediately precedes the first MAC-hs<br>
PDU that has not been received, are delivered to the disassembly block. Here, "the first<br>
MAC-hs PDU that has not been received" refers to the MAC-hs PDU having the<br><br>
smallest TSN among all the not received MAC-hs PDUs having a TSN that is equal to<br>
or greater than the NET.<br>
[80]	In step 670, the NET is updated to equal the TSN of the first not received MAC-hs<br>
PDU of the previous step 660.<br>
[81]	In step 680, the updated NET is compared with the receiver window upper edge<br>
value, and the receiver window is updated (step 690) only if the NET is greater than<br>
the receiver window upper edge value so that the receiver window upper edge value is<br>
matched with the NET, and the steps are completed.<br>
[82]	In the above step 690, when the receiver window is updated, the receiver window<br>
upper edge can be set as the NET, but also, other points within the receiver window<br>
range can be set as the NET to achieve updating.<br>
[83]	Figure 8 depicts the situation where the receiver window is moved due to the<br>
reception of a new PDU and the NET is smaller than the receiver window lower edge.<br>
Here, the exemplary situation assumes the receiver window size to be 5, the NET=4,<br>
and a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=10 is received, while a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=5 and<br>
a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=7 have already been received.<br>
[84]	During the situation shown in Figure 8-(a), a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=10 arrives.<br>
Here, because the PDU with TSN=10 falls outside the receiver window, the receiver<br>
window is moved as shown in Figure 8-(b).<br>
[85]	Any previously received PDU that falls-outside the moved receiver window (i.e., a<br>
received PDU with TSN 
movement, namely, the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=5, is delivered to the upper layer.<br>
Also, because the NET is smaller than the receiver window lower edge value (i.e.,<br>
NET 
[86]	Figure 9 depicts the situation where all PDUs within the receiver window have<br>
been successfully received and the NET is greater than the receiver window upper<br>
edge value. Here, it is also assumed that the receiver window size is 5, the NET=4, and<br>
a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=4 is received while the MAC-hs PDUs with TSN=5,6,7,8<br>
have been received.<br>
[87]	During the situation shown in Figure 9-(a), a MAC-hs PDU with TSN=4 arrives.<br>
This MAC-hs PDU with TSN=4 is stored at position 4 in the reordering buffer as<br>
shown in Figure 9-(b), and those PDUs starting from the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=4<br>
up to the MAC-hs PDU with TSN=8 (which is the MAC-hs PDU just prior to the first<br>
MAC-hs PDU that has not yet been received (i.e., MAC-hs PDU with TSN=9)) are<br>
delivered to the disassembly block. Also, the NET is updated to 9.<br><br>
[88]	As in Figure 9-(c), if the NET is greater than the receiver window upper edge<br>
value, the receiver window upper edge value is updated to the NET, and the receiver<br>
window is moved as shown in Figure 9-(d).<br>
[89]	When using the related art for HSDPA, even if the UE could immediately deliver<br>
the received MAC-hs PDU to the upper layer, prolonged storage in the reordering<br>
buffer causes unnecessary data delivery delays to occur. However, when the UE<br>
employs the present invention to update the NET value and the receiver window, and<br>
processes the MAC-hs PDUs accordingly, unnecessary data delivery delays are<br>
prevented, and thus data transmission errors can be avoided and high speed data<br>
transmissions are made possible.<br>
[90]	The present invention provides a method of handling data blocks, comprising:<br>
receiving data blocks associated with a sequence number; processing the received data<br>
blocks in a receiver window; comparing a next-expected transmission sequence<br>
number (NET) with a range of the receiver window; and setting the NET or the<br>
receiver window such that the NET is within the receiver window, if the NET is found<br>
to be outside that range of the receiver window as a result of the comparison.<br>
[91]	In the above method, the NET is a transmission sequence number (TSN) following<br>
the TSN of the last in-sequence data block received. Here, the TSN is an identifier for<br>
the transmission sequence number on the HS-DSCH, and the TSN is used for<br>
reordering purposes to support in-sequence delivery to a higher layer.	<br>
[92]	If the NET is above a receiver window upper edge, the NET is set as the receiver<br>
window upper edge, or the NET is set as any appropriate position within the receiver<br>
window range. If the NET is above the receiver window, the receiver window is<br>
updated to any appropriate position as long as the NET falls within the receiver<br>
window range.<br>
[93]	If me NET is below a receiver window lower edge, the NET is set as the receiver<br>
window lower edge. If the NET is below the receiver window, setting the NET =<br>
receiver window upper edge value - receiver window size + 1. Here, the NET is a<br>
variable managed by the receiving side, and the NET is updated upon the delivery to<br>
the disassembly entity of the data block with TSN equal NET. In the above method,<br>
the initial value of the NET is zero (0), and the data blocks are MAC-hs PDUs<br>
(protocol data units).<br>
[94]	In the above method, the steps are performed for a HSDPA (high-speed downlink<br>
packet access) system, and the steps are performed to avoid stall conditions. Also, if<br>
the received data block associated with the sequence number had been previously<br><br>
received, the received data block is discarded.<br>
[95]	The present invention also provides a method of processing data blocks,<br>
comprising: a first step of receiving a data block (PDU) having a sequence number<br>
(SN); a second step of comparing the SN with a receiver window range; a third step of<br>
delivering certain PDUs stored in the buffer, starting from the PDU having the NET up<br>
to the PDU just prior to the PDU not yet received, to a disassembly block; and a fourth<br>
step of updating the NET to equal the SN of the first PDU not yet received.<br>
[96]	In the second step, if the SN is within the receiver window range, and if SN 
(a next expected SN) or the PDU had been previously received, then discarding the<br>
PDU, and processing is ended, but if SN (NET or the PDU had not been previously<br>
received, then storing the PDU in a buffer at location specified by the SN, and<br>
proceeding to a third step.<br>
[97]	If the SN is not within the receiver window range, storing the PDU in a buffer at<br>
the location specified by the SN, updating the receiver window such that its upper edge<br>
= SN, delivering all PDUs with SN 
disassembly block, and checking whether the NET 
window; if so, updating the NET to equal the lower edge of the receiver window, and<br>
proceeding to a third step, if not, proceeding to a third step.<br>
[98]	The above method further comprising: after the fourth step, checking whether the<br>
updated NET &gt; the upper edge of the receiver window, if so, setting the NET = the<br>
upper edge of the receiver window, and if not, processing is ended or repeating the<br>
procedures from the first step.<br>
[99]	To implement the above procedures, the present invention can employ various<br>
types of hardware and/or software components (modules). For example, different<br>
hardware modules may contain various circuits and components necessary to perform<br>
the steps of the above method Also, different software modules (executed by<br>
processors and other hardware) may contain various codes and protocols necessary to<br>
perform the steps of the above method.<br>
[100]	Namely, as shown in Figures 1 through 5, the present invention provides an<br>
apparatus to handle data blocks, comprising: a receiving module to receive data blocks<br>
associated with a sequence number; a processing module to process the received data<br>
blocks in a receiver window; a comparing module to compare a next-expected<br>
transmission sequence number (NET) with a range of the receiver window; and a<br>
setting module to set the NET or the receiver window such that the NET is within the<br>
receiver window, if the NET is found to be outside that range of the receiver window<br><br>
as a result of the comparison by the comparing module.<br>
[101]	Preferably, the modules are part of a MAC entity. Preferably, the modules are part<br>
of a MAC-hs entity. Preferably, the modules are part of a mobile station, a wireless<br>
handset, a network, a base station, a Node B or a RNC (radio network controller).<br>

METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDLING DATA BLOCKS<br>
IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
A method and apparatus for handling data blocks in a mobile<br>
communications system are disclosed. The method comprises receiving, at a<br>
receiving module, data blocks associated with a sequence number; determining,<br>
using a determining module, whether the sequence number of the received data<br>
blocks is outside a receiver window; comparing, using a comparing module, a<br>
next-expected transmission sequence number (NET) with a range of an updated<br>
