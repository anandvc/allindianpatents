				<td>POWER CONTROL DEVICE AND METHOD FOR REVERSE LINK<br>
COMMON CHANNEL IN CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power control device and method in a<br>
CDMA communication system, and in particular, to a power control device and<br>
method for a reverse link common channel.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
At present, code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile communication<br>
systems are based on the IS-95 standard which mainly supports the voice service.<br>
However, in the near future, the mobile communication will be performed in<br>
accordance with the IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-2000)<br>
standard which can provide not only the voice service but also a high speed packet<br>
service. That is, the IMT-2000 standard supports a high quality voice service, a<br>
moving picture service, an Internet search service, etc.<br>
The CDMA mobile communication system includes a forward link for<br>
transmitting a signal from a base station (BS) to a mobile station (MS) and a reverse<br>
link for transmitting a signal from the mobile station to the base station.<br>
Conventionally, the CDMA mobile communication system can not control a power<br>
of a common channel for the reverse link. This is because the existing CDMA base<br>
station does not have a structure for controlling the power of the reverse link<br>
common channel. Furthermore, it is difficult to send corresponding power control<br>
commands to the respective mobile stations using a forward link common channel<br>
through which several users receive one Walsh orthogonal channel. Therefore, it<br>
takes a long time for the mobile station to access the system through the reverse link<br>
common channel, and the mobile station can transmit a short message only. In<br>
addition, the mobile station accesses the system without knowing an appropriate<br>
initial system access power, exerting influence on the system.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a channel transmission device for transmitting a power<br>
control command in a conventional CDMA communication system. The illustrated<br>
channel transmission device may be used for a traffic channel or a control channel.<br>
Prior to describing the channel transmission device, for the convenience of<br>
explanation, the input data shall be assumed to be full rate data of a 20ms frame.<br>
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) generator 111 generates 12 CRC bits and<br>
adds the generated CRC bits to 172-bit frame data input, and a tail bit generator 113<br>
generates 8 tail bits and adds the generated tail bits to an end of the CRC-added<br>
frame data to enable an encoder 115 to initialize the data by the frame unit. When<br>
the 172-bit data is input, the data output from the tail bit generator 113 becomes<br>
192-bit data. The encoder 115 then generates 576 symbols per frame by encoding<br>
one-frame data output from the tail bit generator 113, and an interleaver 117<br>
interleaves the encoded data output from the encoder 115.<br>
A bit selector 121 decimates a long code output from a long code generator<br>
119 to match the length of the long code to the length of the interleaved encoded<br>
data. An XOR gate 123 XORs the interleaved encoded data and the decimated long<br>
code to scramble them. After that, a signal convert 125 maps the output signal levels<br>
of the XOR gate 123 by converting a signal level "0" to "+1" and a signal level " 1"<br>
to "-1", and demultiplexes the converted signals by outputting odd-numbered data<br>
to an In-phase channel (first channel) and even-numbered data to a Quadrature-<br>
phase channel (second channel). The I- and Q-channel signals converted are gain<br>
controlled in channel gain controllers 127 and 129, respectively.<br>
A control bit gain controller 131 controls a gain of an input power control<br>
(PC) bit and provides the gain controlled power control bit to puncturers 133 and<br>
135. The puncturers 133 and 135 puncture symbols located at the bit positions<br>
designated by a bit selector 121 and insert therein the power control bits output<br>
from the control bit gain controller 131. The symbols output from the puncturers<br>
133 and 135 are multiplied by an Walsh code in multipliers 139 and 141,<br>
respectively, thus being orthogonally modulated.<br>
However, the number of the available orthogonal codes is limited in the<br>
CDMA communication system. In addition, since many traffic channels should be<br>
assigned to the users for the data communication service, it is expected that the<br>
orthogonal codes will run short. Therefore, when the data communication is<br>
temporarily discontinued in the state where the traffic channel is formed, it is<br>
preferable to temporarily release an orthogonal code for the channel presently in<br>
service and reassign the orthogonal code at the time when the data communication<br>
is restarted, so as to increase utility efficiencies of the orthogonal codes.<br>
However, the channel transmission device of FIG. 1 assigns the orthogonal<br>
code to transmit the power control command, even when there is no actual data to<br>
transmit (in other words, even in the case where data transmission is temporarily<br>
discontinued), thus resulting in a waste of the orthogonal codes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a power control<br>
device and method for a reverse link common channel in a CDMA communication<br>
system.<br>

device and method for a CDMA communication system, in which the mobile station<br>
requests a base station to designate a reverse link common channel and then<br>

a message for designating the reverse link common channel in response to the<br>
request, and controls a transmission power of the designated reverse link common<br>
channel via a forward common power control channel.<br>
To achieve the above object, a common power control channel transmission<br>
device for a base station in a CDMA communication system includes a selector for<br>
receiving power control commands to be transmitted to multiple subscribers and<br>
multiplexing the received power control commands; and a spreading modulator for<br>

For the power control of the reverse link common channel, the base station receives<br>
a signal from a mobile station via the reverse link common channel, and transmits<br>
to the mobile station a power control command for controlling a transmission power<br>
of the reverse lin common channel according to a strength of the received signal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since<br>
they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
FIGs. 2 through 4 illustrate the procedures of controlling a power of a reverse<br>
link common channel during data communication between a base station and a<br>
mobile station according to first through third embodiments of the present invention,<br>
respectively. More specifically, FIG. 2 shows the case in which all the reverse link<br>
common channels are power controlled, FIGs. 3 and 4 show the cases in which<br>
designated ones of the reverse link common channels are power controlled. In<br>
addition, it is assumed that non-designated ones of the reverse link common<br>
channels operate in a slotted Aloha mode, such as in the existing IS-95A system.<br>
For example, in FIG. 3, the reverse link common channel used when a mobile<br>
station sends to a base station an initial designation request message (i.e., a request<br>
for a designated common channel), operates in the slotted Aloha mode.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the mobile station (MS) sends a preamble via a reverse<br>
link common channel, and the base station (BS) sends to the mobile station a power<br>
control command via a forward common power control channel. Here, the reverse<br>
link common channel operates in the slotted Aloha mode and a slot start position<br>
of a new message is predefined between the base station and the mobile station. The<br>
mobile station sends an intended message at a specified time after sending the<br>
preamble for a predefined time. There are two methods for determining the time<br>
point at which the mobile station sends the message.<br>
In a first method, the mobile station sends the message after sending the<br>
preamble for a predetermined time. That is, the mobile station sends the preamble<br>
for initial acquisition of the base station for the predetermined time, and thereafter,<br>
sends the message to the base station at the specified time.<br>
In a second method, the base station informs, using a message signal, the<br>
time at which the mobile station sends the message via the reverse link common<br>
channel. For initial power control, the base station sends a power control command<br>
via the forward common power control channel by measuring an intensity of the<br>
preamble signal received from the mobile station. Upon reception of the power<br>
control command, the mobile station then controls the transmission power according<br>
to the received power control command. That is, upon acquisition of the preamble<br>
send from the mobile station, the base station measures the signal intensity for the<br>
preamble duration and determines whether the measured intensity is appropriate.<br>
The base station sends the power control command by generating a power control<br>
bit (or power control command) according to the measurement. The mobile station<br>
then controls the transmission power of the preamble according to the received<br>
power control command and sends the power controlled preamble to the base<br>
station. Further, the mobile station does not send the message before reception of<br>
a message transmission command from the base station or for a predetermined time,<br>
and continuously sends only the preamble via the reverse link common channel to<br>
control the initial power until the message transmission command is received from<br>
the base station.<br>
In a third method, the mobile station controls the transmission power<br>
according to the power control command at a time predetermined between the<br>
mobile station and the base station, and sends the power controlled message via the<br>
reverse link common channel.<br>
In the preamble transmission procedure, the parameters that should be<br>
matched between the mobile station and the system or the signals for initial<br>
acquisition of the other party, known between the mobile station and the system are<br>
transmitted prior to transmission of a main message. For example, the signals<br>
known between the mobile statio and the system may be all "0"s or " 1 "s.<br>
While the base station sends the power control command to power control<br>
the reverse link common channel, a power of the power control command received<br>
from the mobile station may become lower than a threshold value or the forward<br>
link may have a bad channel condition. In this case, it is necessary for the mobiles<br>
station to stop sending the signals. Here, the channel condition of the forward link<br>
can be determined by measuring Ec/Io of a pilot channel for the forward link. This<br>
is to reduce the system interference which may be caused when the mobile station<br>
sends the message via the reverse channel in a state where the power is not<br>
appropriately controlled.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the base station sends, via the forward link common<br>
channel, a command for ordering the mobile station to send the message using a<br>
designated common channel for the reverse link, together with information required<br>
in sending the command. This procedure can be available in the case where the base<br>
station requests a certain response message from the mobile station or requests the<br>
mobile station to send specific data. Here, the mobile station sends only the<br>
preamble signal (or pilot signal) until the base station sends a message transmission<br>
command or for a predetermined time, so as to control the transmission power<br>
between the base station and the mobile station. The base station sends a power<br>
control command via the forward common power control channel in response to the<br>
signal from the mobile station. Upon reception of the message transmission<br>
command from the base station or after a lapse of the predetermined time, the<br>
mobile station sends to the base station an intended message via the designated<br>
channel for the reverse link. Even at this time, the base station continues to send the<br>
power control command so as to continuously control the power while the mobile<br>
station sends the message.<br>
Here, the designated common channel refers to a specific channel which can<br>
be exclusively used by a specific user, among the common channels which can be<br>
used in common by all the users. For designation of the common channels, several<br>
codes are separately provided in addition to the codes for the common channels, and<br>
one of the codes is assigned to one user for a while. Alternatively, for designation<br>
of the common channels, one of the common channels is assigned to one user for<br>
a while, who requires a designated channel, and the other users cannot use this<br>
channel in the meantime. In designating the reverse link common channels, it is<br>
possible to designate which long codes will be used as spreading codes. The long<br>
codes may be the existing public long codes, the long codes for the access channels,<br>
the long codes for the common control channels or the separate long codes for<br>
channel designation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the mobile station sends to the base station a message<br>
for requesting a designated common channel via the common channel for the<br>
reverse link. Here, the mobile station can send the message after adding information<br>
about an amount of the data to be sent through the designated common channel. The<br>
request message may be an ID of the mobile station (e.g., ESN). Upon reception of<br>
the designated channel request message and the data amount information, the base<br>
station determines whether to designate the common channel, taking into<br>
consideration the use and amount of the data to be sent from the mobile station<br>
which requests the designated channel and the system condition, and sends a<br>
response signal to the mobile station using the common channel for the forward<br>
link. When the response signal includes channel designation information, the base<br>
station sends a power control command after a lapse of a specified time. Here, the<br>
mobile station sends the preamble until the base station sends a message<br>
transmission command for allowing the mobile station to send the message via the<br>
designated channel based on the response signal or for a predetermined time, so as<br>
to enable the base station to use this preamble in demodulation. In addition, the<br>
preamble duration can be used in controlling the transmission power of the<br>
designated reverse link common channel. Upon reception of the message<br>
transmission command from the base station or after a lapse of the predetermined<br>
time, the mobile station sends to the base station the intended message via the<br>
designated channel for the reverse link. Even at this time, the base station continues<br>
to send the power control command to continuously control the power while the<br>
mobile station sends the message.<br>
To power control the reverse link common channel, the base station should<br>
send the power control command to the mobile station via the forward link.<br>
However, when the mobile station sends the reverse link common channel, a<br>
dedicated channel is not assigned for the forward link and the data or control<br>
command is transmitted through the forward common channel. When the dedicated<br>
channel is not assigned for the forward link and one Walsh channel is used by<br>
several users like the common channel, it is difficult to send the power control<br>
commands to the respective mobile stations. Although the power control commands<br>
described in FIGs. 2 to 4 can be sent by puncturing the power control bits into the<br>
forward common channel, it is also possible to use other specific channel such as<br>
a common power control channel.<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates a structure of a common power control channel<br>
transmitted via the common power control channel according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The base station assigns one common orthogonal code to the<br>
common power control channel and sends the power control commands to multiple<br>
subscribers via this common power control channel. A power control group<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as PCG) has a length which is a reciprocal of a transmission<br>
frequency of the power control commands. That is, when the power control<br>
commands are transmitted 800 times for one second, the length of one PCG<br>
becomes 1.25msec (=l/800sec). Further, in the figure, PCC1-PCCM represent the<br>
power control commands for the respective subscribers, and one common power<br>
control channel can transmit M power control commands in maximum. That is, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5A, one PCG consists of M power control commands PCC1-PCCM<br>
for M subscribers and the PCG is spread with one orthogonal code and transmitted<br>
via the common power control channel.<br>
The power control commands PCC1-PCCM for the respective subscribers<br>
can be transmitted via the common power control channel by fixing their positions.<br>
However, when the transmission powers of the power control commands are<br>
different or when the slots at which the power control commands are transmitted are<br>
mixed with the slots at which the power control commands are not transmitted, it<br>
is preferable to hop the positions of the power control commands to randomly place<br>
them within one power control group so as to reduce an interference according to<br>
the slot positions and provide a uniform transmission spectrum of the base station.<br>
In this case, a hopping pattern of the power control commands can be implemented<br>
in a similar manner to a method used for implementing the frequency hopping<br>
pattern of a FH-SS (Frequency Hopping-Spread Spectrum) system. In the<br>
embodiment, the hopping pattern of the power control commands is stored in a<br>
look-up table to pseudo-randomizes the positions of the power control commands.<br>
FIG. 5B shows a look-up table for storing the hopping pattern by which the<br>
power control commands are inserted into the slots of the common power control<br>
channel according to an embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 5B, the<br>
number of the power control commands, M, is assumed to be 8. In the figure,<br>
numerals in the respective boxes represent slot ID numbers assigned to the<br>
subscribers. Accordingly, the positions of the power control commands within one<br>
PCG for the common power control channel depend upon the slot ID number and<br>
PCG number.<br>
FIG. 5C shows a slot hopping pattern for the power control commands,<br>
having the slot ID number of 2, in the slot ID look-up table of FIG. 5B.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a common power control channel transmitter for<br>
transmitting the power control commands to the respective subscribers which share<br>
the same orthogonal code and belong to one power control group. Referring to FIG.<br>
6, the power control commands PCC1-PCCM transmitted to the respective<br>
subscribers can be scrambled by user"s pseudo-random noise (UPN) sequences<br>
UPN1-UPNM. UPNs 311-31M generate unique PN sequences (e.g., long codes)<br>
assigned to the respective subscribers. Multipliers 321-32M multiply the power<br>
control commands PCC1-PCCM by the corresponding user"s PN sequences UPN 1 -<br>
UPNM, respectively. The respective power commands are multiplied by different<br>
gains and then transmitted to the corresponding subscribers. That is, gain controllers<br>
331-33M receive the power control commands output from the corresponding<br>
multipliers 321-32M and control gains of the received power control commands<br>
according to corresponding gain control signals. The locations of the assigned<br>
power control commands can be fixed on the common power control channel.<br>
Alternatively, the locations of the power control commands can be varied at the<br>
respective PCGs to provide a uniform spectrum. A slot controller 340 generates a<br>
signal for determining the slot positions into which the power control commands<br>
output via the common power control channel are inserted. That is, the slot<br>
controller 340 includes the slot hopping look-up pattern table structured as shown<br>
in FIG. 5B and generates a slot control signal for designating time slots into which<br>
the power control commands for the respective subscribers are inserted, by<br>
consulting the slot hopping pattern table.<br>
A selector 350 receives the gain controlled power control commands PCC1-<br>
PCCM and multiplexes the received power control commands according to the slot<br>
control signal output from the slot controller 340. That is, the selector 350, under<br>
the control of the slot control signal output form the slot controller 340, selects one<br>
of the power control commands PCC1-PCCM and outputs the selected power<br>
control command to the common power control channel. A multiplexer can be used<br>
for the selector 350.<br>
An orthogonal modulator is composed of an orthogonal code generator 361<br>
and a multiplier 362. The orthogonal code generator 361 generates an orthogonal<br>
code for orthogonally modulating the power control commands transmitted through<br>
the common power control channel, and the multiplier 362 multiplies the power<br>
control commands for the respective subscribers output from the selector 350 by the<br>
orthogonal code. That is, the orthogonal modulator modulates the power control<br>
commands for several subscribers using one orthogonal code and outputs the<br>
orthogonally modulated power control commands to the common power control<br>
channel.<br>
A spreading modulator is composed of a spreading sequence generator 371<br>
and a multiplier 372. The spreading sequence generator 371 generates a spreading<br>
sequence for spreading the orthogonally modulated signals. The multiplier 372<br>
multiplies the orthogonally modulated signals by the spreading sequence to spread<br>
the power control commands and outputs the spread power control commands via<br>
the common power control channel. Although the orthogonal modulator and the<br>
spreading modulator employ binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation, they<br>
also can employ quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation. In this case, the<br>
power control commands output from the selector 350 are demultiplexed to output<br>
odd-numbered power control commands to a first channel and even-numbered<br>
power control commands to a second channel. Thereafter, the divided channel<br>
signals are separately subjected to the orthogonal modulation and the spreading<br>
modulation.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the power control commands transmitted to<br>
the respected subscribers via the common power control channel are scrambled with<br>
the corresponding user"s PN sequences UPN1-UPNM and output to the<br>
corresponding gain controllers 331-33M. However, it is possible to remove the<br>
scheme for scrambling the power control commands with the user"s PN sequences.<br>
In this case, the power control commands PCC1-PCCM are directly applied to the<br>
corresponding gain controllers 331-33M. The gain controllers 331-33M then<br>
multiply the received power control commands by the corresponding gains and<br>
output them to the selector 350.<br>
The slot controller 340 designates the time slots for arranging the power<br>
control commands to be transmitted to the respective subscribers, on the common<br>
power control channel. As illustrated in FIG. 5A, the slot controller 340 assigns the<br>
positions of the respective power control commands for the respective power<br>
control groups. There are known two methods for assigning the power control<br>
commands: one is to fix the positions of the power control commands and another<br>
is to vary the positions for the respective PCGs. In the embodiment, the slot<br>
controller 340 includes the slot hopping pattern look-up table of FIG. 5B and<br>
variably designates the insert positions of the power control commands for the<br>
respective subscribers. The selector 350 assigns the power control commands output<br>
from the gain controllers 331-33M to the specified locations according to the slot<br>
control signal output from the slot controller 340, as shown in FIG. 5A.<br>
The power control commands are then multiplied by the orthogonal code in<br>
the multiplier 362 to be orthogonally modulated and again multiplied by the<br>
spreading sequence in the multiplier 372 to be spread.<br>
If the base station sends the power control commands for the respective<br>
subscribers via the common power control channel for the forward link, the mobile<br>
stations control the transmission power of the reverse link according to the power<br>
control commands received. In most cases, the mobile stations should receive user<br>
data and control commands via the traffic channels, in addition to the power control<br>
commands received via the common power control channel. For this, the mobile<br>
stations employ one of the following two receiver types: one is a separate receiver<br>
consisting of a common power control channel receiver and a traffic channel<br>
receiver; and another is a shared receiver which receives the power control<br>
commands on the common power control channel using the traffic channel receiver.<br>
The traffic channel refers to a control channel and a data channel for transmitting<br>
the control commands and the user data. Here, the traffic channels include a<br>
fundamental channel for transmitting voice traffic and a supplemental channel for<br>
transmitting packet data. The structure of the mobile station will be described later<br>
on.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a structure of a message that the base station sends to assign<br>
the designated reverse link common channel to the mobile station via the forward<br>
link, when the common power control channel is used. The message can be used as<br>
the response message when the base station assigns the designated reverse link<br>
common channel to the mobile station as shown in FIG. 3 or when the base station<br>
requests the designated reverse link common channel as shown in FIG. 4. As<br>
illustrated, the message consists of a message body having specific contents, a<br>
designation flag, channel designation information representing the designated<br>
common channel for the reverse link, a power control flag representing whether to<br>
control the power, preamble start time information representing a start time of the<br>
preamble, a Walsh number representing a Walsh code number used for the common<br>
power control channel, and a slot index representing the locations of the power<br>
control commands. When the common power control channel is not used, the Walsh<br>
number and the slot index are excluded from the message.<br>
The designation flag represents whether the designated common channel is<br>
available or not. The channel designation information is (identification) information<br>
about the designated channel when the designated channel is available. The channel<br>
designation information can be used in informing a long code to be used for<br>
spreading the reverse link common channel in the mobile station. When the long<br>
code is already known to the mobile sation, the channel designation information<br>
may represent whether the long code is used or not. The successive power control<br>
flag and preamble are also valid only when the designated channel is used. The<br>
common power control command includes the Walsh number and the slot index for<br>
the common power control channel assigned to the mobile stations. The Walsh<br>
number, which is a system parameter, is not required to be transmitted separately,<br>
when it is previously known to the mobile station or predefined like the existing<br>
forward pilot channel. The slot index may designate fixed positions when the power<br>
control commands are located at the fixed positions or designate corresponding slot<br>
IDs when the positions of the power control commands are varied in several forms.<br>
Even when the position of the slot index is changed pseudo-randomly for the<br>
respective PCGs, it is not necessary to transmit the slot index when it is known to<br>
the base station and the mobile sation. Further, when the mobile station sends a<br>
message by power controlling the common channel for the reverse link, the<br>
preamble signal is used for the initial power control. Although the time for starting<br>
transmission of the preamble signal can be set after a lapse of a predetermined time<br>
succeeding a message for assigning the designated reverse link common channel,<br>
the base station can designate the time to the preamble start time information.<br>
FIGs. 8A and 8B are diagrams for explaining the power control procedures<br>
when the message is transmitted by power controlling the reverse link common<br>
channel according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The reverse link<br>
common channels are assumed to operate in the slotted Aloha mode where they are<br>
not designated as in the existing IS-95 system so that they may collide with each<br>
other. Here, it is assumed that the slot IDs of the common power control channel<br>
and the reverse link common channels are previously matched between the base<br>
station and the mobile station on a one-to-one (or point-to-point) basis.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, the base station sends the power control command to<br>
the mobile station, and the mobile station sends the message MSG after sending the<br>
preamble for the predetermined time, to use the power controlled reverse link<br>
common channel. A description will be made as to an operation of controlling the<br>
initial power of the base station and the mobile sation while the mobile station sends<br>
the preamble. The power of the initial preamble that the mobile station sends is<br>
calculated by<br>
Initial Transmission Power = (1st Constant) - (Total Receiving Power of<br>
Mobile Station) [dB] ....(1)<br>
Initial Transmission Power = (2nd Constant) - (Receiving power, Ec/Io, of<br>
Pilot Signal from Connected Base Station) [dB] .... (2)<br>
In equations (1) and (2), different constants can be used for the respective<br>
systems. These values should be low enough to minimize interference with the<br>
system. In addition, since the initial transmission power is set to a sufficiently low<br>
value within a normal operation range, the base station sends a power-up command<br>
until the preamble signal sent from the mobile station is acquired during the power<br>
control process. Upon acquisition of the preamble signal from the mobile station,<br>
the base station estimates a receiving power of the signal and sends a power control<br>
command according to the estimation. In this manner, it is possible to adjust the<br>
receiving power of the reverse link to an appropriate range prior to sending an<br>
actual message, when the base station fails to acquire the preamble signal because<br>
the initial power of the reverse common channel is too low, or when the mobile<br>
station sends the reverse link common channel with an excessively high power. This<br>
procedure will be defined as "initial power control". Since the base station can<br>
compare the receiving power (or strength) of the reverse link after acquisition of the<br>
signal sent from the mobile station, it can send the power-up command or the<br>
power-down command of the mobile station. In the embodiment, a duration TW for<br>
which the mobile station sends the preamble to control the initial power is<br>
predefined. However, the duration TW can be varied by sending a message<br>
transmission command to the mobile station at the time when it is judged that the<br>
base station has controlled the power appropriately by acquiring the preamble so as<br>
to stop sending the preamble.<br>
FIG. 8A corresponds to the case where the pilot channel is not transmitted<br>
together while the message is transmitted via the reverse link common channel. This<br>
is the case where the reverse link common channel does not include the pilot<br>
channel as in the existing 1S-95 system. However, for coherent demodulation, the<br>
reverse link according to the IMT-2000 standard transmits the pilot channel together<br>
with the message. The pilot channel is used for estimation of the channel condition<br>
by the base station receiver and synchronization between the transmitter and the<br>
receiver.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, the signal transmitted via the pilot channel during the<br>
initial power control serves as the preamble signal, and after completion of the<br>
initial power control, serves as the pilot signal. The strength of the signal serving<br>
as the pilot signal can be different from that of the signal serving as the preamble<br>
signal. When the preamble signal is transmitted via the pilot channel in this manner,<br>
the common channel for the reverse link maintains a standby state without<br>
generating other signals for a predefined time TW or until the base station sends a<br>
message transmission command, as illustrated. This is the same even in the<br>
designated common channel of FIG. 9B which will be described later.<br>
FIGs. 9A and 9B illustrate the power control procedures when the message<br>
is transmitted by power controlling the designated common channel for the reverse<br>
link according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Here, the power<br>
control can be achieved equally as described with reference to FIGs. 8A and 8B.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 9A and 9B, the mobile station sends a request message for<br>
the designated reverse link common channel via the reverse link common channel.<br>
Upon reception of the request message, the base station grants the mobile station to<br>
use the designated reverse link common channel via the forward link common<br>
channel, and sends a response signal having the channel designation information.<br>
Taking into consideration the transmission delay of the response signal and the<br>
reception delay of the mobile station, the mobile station sends the message after<br>
waiting for a predefined time TG and sending the preamble signal for the time TW.<br>
The base station also sends the power control command after a lapse of the time TG<br>
and the mobile station sends, as illustrated, the preamble signal and the message via<br>
the designated reverse link common channel by controlling the power according to<br>
the power control command from the base station. The initial power control is<br>
performed between the base station and the mobile station for the time TW where<br>
the pilot signal serving as the preamble signal is transmitted via the pilot channel.<br>
FIGs. 10A and 10B illustrate the power control procedures when the base<br>
station designates the common channel for the reverse link at the request of the<br>
mobile station and the mobile station sends a message by power controlling this<br>
designated reverse link common channel. The power control can be performed<br>
equally as described with reference to FIGs. 8A and 8B.<br>
In FIGs. 8A through 10B, the non-designated channels among the reverse<br>
link common channels are assumed to operate in the slotted Aloha mode as in the<br>
existing system. Further, the base station sends the power control command to the<br>
mobile station via the forward common power control channel. In the figures, the<br>
signals transmitted via the respective channels are represented with respect to the<br>
time. FIGs. 8A, 9A and 10A correspond to the case where the reverse link does not<br>
use the pilot channel, and FIGs. 8B, 9B and 10B correspond to the case where the<br>
reverse link uses the pilot channel. In those figures, the transmission power of the<br>
power controlled reverse link common channel is represented by the height of the<br>
transmission signal in order to explain the embodiment in which the mobile station<br>
controls the initial power by transmitting the preamble.<br>
As stated above, if the base station outputs the power control commands for<br>
the respective subscribers via the common power control channel for the forward<br>
link, the mobile stations control the transmission power of the reverse link<br>
according to the power control commands received via the common power control<br>
channel. In most cases, the mobile stations may receive the a message or a control<br>
command via the data (or traffic) channel, in addition to the power control<br>
commands. Further, in some cases, the mobile stations should monitor the forward<br>
common channel during transmission of the reverse link common channel, to<br>
receive the control message in addition to the common control channel for the<br>
reverse link. In the specification, the above case will be described by way of<br>
example. Here, as stated above, a device for controlling the power control command<br>
of the common power control channel and receiving the forward data channel can<br>
be implemented in the separate receiver or the shared receiver. The separate receiver<br>
sends the power control command by independently operating the common power<br>
control channel, the traffic channel and the control channel. The separate receiver<br>
should include a separate despreader for independently demodulating information<br>
on the traffic channel, the control channel and the common power control channel.<br>
In the meantime, the shared receiver demodulates the power control command on<br>
the common power control channel and the corresponding channel information<br>
using one despreader.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a forward data channel structure for the shared receiver<br>
of the mobile station. FIG. 12 illustrates timings of the forward data channel and the<br>
common power control channel. FIG. 13 illustrates a structure of the mobile station<br>
for receiving the forward link data channel of FIG. 11.<br>
Furthermore, FIG. 14 illustrates a forward common power control channel<br>
in which the forward data channel is not punctured at the position where the power<br>
control command is transmitted to the mobile station. Operations of the shared<br>
receiver and the separate receiver will be described with reference to FIGs. 15 and<br>
16, respectively. Here, the shared receiver of FIG. 13 and the separate receiver of<br>
FIG. 17 are used.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates the forward data channel transmitter for transmitting the<br>
channel information in association with the common power control channel<br>
transmitter according to the present invention in the CDMA communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a CRC generator 111 generates 12 CRC bits and adds<br>
them to the input frame data. A tail bit generator 113 generates 8 tail bits for<br>
representing termination of one frame and adds them to the frame data output from<br>
the CRC generator 111. An encoder 115 encodes the frame data output from the tail<br>
bit generator 113. A convolutional encoder or a turbo encoder may be used for the<br>
encoder 115. An interleaver 117 interleaves the encoded bits (i.e., symbols) output<br>
from the encoder 115. A block interleaver can be used for the interleaver 117.<br>
A long code generator 119 generates a long code for use in scrambling user<br>
information. Here, the long code is a unique user identification code and<br>
corresponds to the user"s PN sequence in the transmitter. A decimator 121<br>
decimates the long code to match a rate of the symbols output from the interleaver<br>
1 17 to a rate of the long code. An XOR gate 123 XORs the encoded symbols output<br>
from the interleaver 117 and the decimated long code.<br>
A demultiplexing and signal power mapping part 125 demultiplexes the data<br>
output from the XOR gate 123 into 1-channel (i.e., first channel) data and Q-channel<br>
(i.e., second channel) data, and maps signal levels of the symbol data by converting<br>
data of "0" to "+1" and data of" 1" to "-1". A channel gain controller 127 receives<br>
the first channel data and controls a gain of the received first channel data according<br>
to a gain control signal. A channel gain controller 129 receives the second channel<br>
data and control a gain of the received second channel data according to a gain<br>
control signal.<br>
A puncture position controller 400 generates a puncture position control<br>
signal for puncturing the symbols on the traffic channel corresponding to the slot<br>
positions into which the power control commands for the corresponding subscriber<br>
are inserted. The puncture position controller 400 generates the puncture position<br>
control signal in the same manner as the slot controller 340 of FIG. 6. The puncture<br>
position control signal is generated for a symbol data duration of one frame based<br>
on the slot hopping pattern look-up table of FIG. 5B. A first puncturer 133 receives<br>
the data symbols output from the channel gain controller 127 and punctures (or<br>
deletes) the data symbols according to the puncture position control signal output<br>
from the puncture position controller 400. A second puncturer 135 receives the data<br>
symbols output from the channel gain controller 129 and punctures the data symbols<br>
according to the puncture position control signal output from the puncture position<br>
controller 400. That is, the puncturers 133 and 135 receive the data symbols output<br>
from the channel gain controllers 127 and 129, and puncture the data symbols<br>
located at the positions corresponding to the puncture position control signal output<br>
from the puncture position controller 400. As a result, the puncturers 133 and 135<br>
output the first and second channel symbol data, with the symbols located at the<br>
time slots for the power control commands being punctured.<br>
An orthogonal code generator 137 generates an orthogonal code according<br>
to a Walsh code number Wno and a Walsh code length Wlength. A multiplier 139<br>
multiplies the first channel data symbols output from the first puncturer 133 by the<br>
orthogonal code to generate an orthogonally modulated signal for the first channel.<br>
A multiplier 141 multiplies the second channel data symbols output from the second<br>
puncturer 135 by the orthogonal code to generate an orthogonally modulated signal<br>
for the second channel. A PNI generator 143 generates a PN sequence PNI for the<br>
first channel (i.e., 1-channel). A multiplier 145 multiplies the orthogonal modulation<br>
signal output from the multiplier 139 by the PNI sequence to generate a spread<br>
signal for the first channel. A PNQ generator 147 generates a PN sequence PNQ for<br>
the second channel (i.e., Q-channel). A multiplier 149 multiplies the orthogonal<br>
modulation signal output from the multiplier 141 by the PNQ sequence to generate<br>
a spread signal for the second channel.<br>
For the convenience of explanation, it will be assumed that a fundamental<br>
channel receiver not only demodulates input data but also receives the power<br>
control commands transmitted via the common power control channel. In this case,<br>
the channel transmitter structured as shown in FIG. 11 becomes a fundamental<br>
channel transmitter.<br>
In operation, the CRC generator 111 adds the CRC bits to the input frame<br>
data to enable a receiver to determine a quality of the frame. When one frame has<br>
a length of 172 bits, the CRC generator 111 generates 12 CRC bits and adds them<br>
to the input frame data. The CRC bit-added frame data is applied to the tail bit<br>
generator 113 which generates 8 tail bits per frame and adds them to the CRC bit-<br>
added frame data. The tail bits are used to represent termination of one frame and<br>
serve to initialize the encoder 115 at the following stage of the tail bit generator<br>
113. It is assumed that the encoder 115 used in the embodiment is a convolutional<br>
encoder having a constraint length, K=9, and a coding rate, R=1/3. In this case, the<br>
encoder 115 encodes 192 bits per frame into 576 symbols per frame. The interleaver<br>
1 17 receives 576 symbols per frame output from the encoder 115 and rearranges the<br>
bits within the frame by the frame unit to increase a tolerance for the burst error.<br>
The decimator 121 decimates the long code output from the long code<br>
generator 119 to match a rate of the long code to that of the symbols output from<br>
the interleaver 117. The XOR gate 123 XORs the interleaved signal and the<br>
decimated long code to scramble the interleaved signal.<br>
The demultiplexing and signal power mapping part 125 demultiplexes the<br>
symbols output form the XOR gate 123 to output the odd-numbered symbols to the<br>
first channel and the even-numbered symbols to the second channel. Also, the<br>
demultiplexing and signal power mapping part 125 maps signal levels by converting<br>
a signal level "1" to "-1" and a signal level "0" to "+1". The channel gain<br>
controllers 127 and 129 control gains of the symbols for the first and second<br>
channels, respectively.<br>
The puncturers 133 and 135 then puncture the symbols located at the<br>
positions of the power control commands on the common power control channel,<br>
under the control of the puncture position controller 400. That is, the puncture<br>
position controller 400 designates the symbol puncture positions corresponding to<br>
the positions of the power control commands for the corresponding subscriber on<br>
the common power control channel, in the same manner as the slot controller 340<br>
of FIG. 6. The puncturers 133 and 135 then puncture the designated symbols for the<br>
first and second channels, respectively.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram for explaining a relationship between the power control<br>
commands output from the common power control channel transmitter of FIG. 6<br>
and the channel transmitter of FIG. 11 and the fundamental channel (user channel)<br>
information. In FIG. 12, reference numeral 511 represents a common power control<br>
channel having M power control commands PCC1-PCCM for M subscribers,<br>
wherein PCCi represents the power control command for i-th subscriber. Further,<br>
reference numeral 513 represents a fundamental channel in which a symbol<br>
corresponding to the power control command PCCi is deleted (i.e., punctured).<br>
Turning back to FIG. 11, after puncturing is performed in the puncturers 133<br>
and 135, the multiplier 139 multiplies the symbols output from the puncture 133 by<br>
the orthogonal code output from the orthogonal code generator 137 to generate<br>
orthogonally modulated transmission signals for the first channel, and the multiplier<br>
141 multiplies the symbols output from the puncture 135 by the orthogonal code<br>
output from the orthogonal code generator 137 to generate orthogonally modulated<br>
transmission signals for the second channel. The orthogonal code used in the<br>
channel transmitter is a Walsh code or a quasi-orthogonal code. In addition, the<br>
multipliers 145 and 149 multiply the orthogonally modulated signals for the first<br>
and second channels by the PN sequences PNI and PNQ, respectively, to spread the<br>
orthogonally modulated signals.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates the subscriber channel receiver for receiving the power<br>
control commands according to the present invention in the CDMA communication<br>
system. In the figure, a spreading sequence generator 611 generates a spreading<br>
sequence for despreading a received spread signal. A PN sequence can be used for<br>
the spreading sequence. A multiplier 613 multiplies the input spread signal by the<br>
spreading sequence to despread the input spread signal.<br>
A PCC bit position selector 615 generates a position select signal for<br>
selecting a slot into which the power control command for the corresponding<br>
subscriber is inserted. A first orthogonal code generator 617 generates an orthogonal<br>
code Wdt assigned to the traffic channel for the corresponding subscriber, and a<br>
second orthogonal code generator 619 generates an orthogonal code Wsp assigned<br>
to the common power control channel. Here, the orthogonal code Wsp generated<br>
from the second orthogonal code generator 619 is assigned in common to several<br>
subscribers receiving the power control commands transmitted via the common<br>
power control channel for the forward link. A switch 621 selects the orthogonal<br>
code Wdt or the orthogonal code Wsp according to the position select signal output<br>
from the PCC bit position selector 615. A multiplier 623 multiplies the despread<br>
signal output from the multiplier 613 by the orthogonal code selected in the switch<br>
621, to demodulate the orthogonally modulated signal. An accumulator 625<br>
accumulates an output of the multiplier 623. This structure corresponds to a<br>
subscriber channel receiver associated with the common power control channel.<br>
A third orthogonal code generator 631 generates an orthogonal code Wpi for<br>
the pilot channel. A multiplier 633 multiplies an output of the multiplier 613 by the<br>
orthogonal code Wpi for the pilot channel, to generate a pilot channel signal. A<br>
channel estimator 635 estimates an energy of the pilot signal by receiving an output<br>
of the multiplier 633. A complex conjugator 637 calculates a complex conjugate by<br>
receiving an output of the channel estimator 635. This structure corresponds to a<br>
pilot channel receiver.<br>
A multiplier 627 multiplies an output of the complex conjugator 637 by an<br>
output of the accumulator 625. A switch 629 switches an output of the multiplier<br>
627 to the data channel or the power control channel according to the position select<br>
signal from the PCC bit position selector 615.<br>
In operation, the subscriber channel receiver structured as described above<br>
receives information on both the corresponding subscriber channel and the common<br>
power control channel. The multiplier 613 despreads the received signal which was<br>
spread during transmission, by multiplying the received signal by the spreading<br>
sequence generated from the spreading sequence generator 611. The despread signal<br>
is again multiplied in the multiplier 633 by the orthogonal code Wpi for the pilot<br>
channel. In the way, the multiplier 633 extracts the pilot channel signal from the<br>
receive signal. The channel estimator 635 estimates the pilot channel signal to<br>
determine the pilot channel condition. The estimated pilot channel signal is applied<br>
to the multiplier 627 through the complex conjugator 637. In doing so, the pilot<br>
channel signal is demodulated in the same way as in a common pilot channel<br>
receiver.<br>
The subscriber channel receiver receives positional information about the slot<br>
into which the power control command for the corresponding subscriber is inserted<br>
and orthogonal code information about the common power control channel. The<br>
PCC bit position selector 615 has the slot hopping pattern look-up table structured<br>
as shown in FIG. 5B. Therefore, the PCC bit position selector 615 can detect the<br>
slot into which the power control command for the corresponding subscriber is<br>
inserted, based on the received positional information and the look-up table. In other<br>
words, it is possible to detect the position of the symbol punctured as shown in FIG.<br>
12. The PCC bit position selector 615 generates the position select signal for<br>
controlling the switches 621 and 629 at the position of the punctured symbol. The<br>
switch 621 is normally connected to an output node of the first orthogonal code<br>
generator 617, and is switched to an output node of the second orthogonal code<br>
generator 619 in response to the position select signal generated from the PCC bit<br>
position selector 615. Similarly, the switch 629 is normally connected to an input<br>
node of a data combiner (not shown), and is switched to an input node of a power<br>
control command combiner (not shown) in response to the position select signal<br>
generated from the PCC bit position selector 615.<br>
As a result, for the symbol data processing interval, the despread signal<br>
output from the multiplier 613 is multiplied in the multiplier 623 by the first<br>
orthogonal code Wdt to be demodulated, and then accumulated in the accumulator<br>
625. The output of the accumulator 625 is compensated in the multiplier 627 and<br>
then applied to the data combiner via the switch 629. During the symbol data<br>
processing, if the PCC bit position selector 615 generates the position select signal,<br>
the switch 621 is switched to the output node of the second orthogonal code<br>
generator 619 and the switch 629 is switched to the input node of the power control<br>
command combiner. As a result, the power control command for the corresponding<br>
subscriber is multiplied in the multiplier 623 by the second orthogonal code Wsp<br>
to be demodulated, and then applied to the power control command combiner via<br>
the accumulator 625, the multiplier 627 and the switch 629.<br>
In sum, the subscriber channel receiver generates two separate orthogonal<br>
codes: one for demodulating the subscriber channel information and another for<br>
demodulating the power control command. That is, the subscriber channel receiver<br>
selects the orthogonal code for the subscriber channel to demodulate the symbol<br>
data, and selects the orthogonal code for the common power control channel to<br>
demodulate the power control command. Here, since the symbol on the subscriber<br>
channel located at the position corresponding to the power control command for the<br>
subscriber is punctured, there is no influence of the symbols in demodulating the<br>
power control command at the receiver.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an example that the base station sends different forward data<br>
channels while transmitting the power control commands using the common power<br>
control channel. In this example, the forward data channels are the forward link<br>
common channels (e.g., a traffic channel or a control channel) and the power<br>
control commands are inserted into the separate common power control channel<br>
rather than the forward link common channels. Unlike the structure of FIG. 11, the<br>
symbols on the forward data channels are not punctured when the power control<br>
commands are transmitted to the respective subscribers via the common power<br>
control channel.<br>
FIGs. 15 and 16 show different examples that the mobile station<br>
simultaneously receives, from the base station, a control message via the forward<br>
link common channels and a power control command via the common power<br>
control channel.<br>
In FIG. 15, the mobile station receives both the messages via different<br>
forward link common channels and the power control command via the common<br>
power control channel using one channel receiver. In order to use the common<br>
power control channel, the base station sends, to the mobile station, a Walsh code<br>
number for the common power control channel to be used and information about<br>
the position of the power control command (hereinafter, referred to as "common<br>
power control channel information"). However, if the slot position is determined<br>
in a pseudo-random method commonly known to the mobile station and the base<br>
station, it is not necessary to send the information representing the position of the<br>
power control command (or a power control bit). Based on the common power<br>
control channel information, the mobile stations (e.g., j-th to k-th mobile stations)<br>
can know their own Walsh codes and the positions where the power control<br>
commands for themselves are located.<br>
The channel receiver in each mobile station receives the message transmitted<br>
via the forward common control channel using the assigned Walsh code (Wj or<br>
Wk), and after a lapse of a predefined time, receives the power control command<br>
using the Walsh code Wi assigned for the common power control channel. After<br>
reception of the power control command, the channel receiver receives the message<br>
on the forward common channel using the previously used Walsh code (Wj or Wk).<br>
Since the mobile station receives the message on the forward common control<br>
channel and the power control command on the common power control channel<br>
using a single channel receiver, it cannot receive the message symbol transmitted<br>
via the forward common control channel while receiving the power control<br>
command, thereby obtaining the result of puncturing the power control command<br>
into the forward common control channel. However, when the power control<br>
command is added to the traffic channel as in the prior art, one separate Walsh code<br>
should be continuously assigned for transmission of the power control command,<br>
even when there is no message to be transmitted via the traffic channel, thereby<br>
resulting in a waste of the Walsh code resources. In the embodiment, however, with<br>
use of the common power control channel, it is possible to release the assigned<br>
Walsh code (Wj or Wk) when there is no message to transmit and receive the power<br>
control command at a predefined position using the Walsh code Wi, efficiently<br>
utilizing the Walsh code resources for the forward link.<br>
In FIG. 16, each mobile station receives the messages via different forward<br>
link common control channels using two channel receivers and receives the power<br>
control command via the common power control channel. Unlike the case of FIG.<br>
15, since the mobile station has two channel receivers, it can receive the message<br>
symbols transmitted via the forward link common control channels even while<br>
receiving the power control command. As a result, it is possible to prevent the<br>
channel degradation which may occur in the case where the symbols on the forward<br>
common control channel are partially punctured to insert therein the power control<br>
commands.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates a mobile station structure for simultaneously receiving the<br>
common power control channel and the forward data channel in the same manner<br>
as shown in FIG. 16.<br>
FIGs. 18A and 18B are flow charts illustrating operations of the base station<br>
and the mobile station when a message is transmitted by power controlling the<br>
reverse link common channel according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the mobile station and the base station control the initial power<br>
using the preamble that the mobile station sends for a predefined time TW, prior to<br>
sending an actual message.<br>
Referring to FIG. ISA, in step A1, the mobile station (MS) sends a preamble<br>
signal of an initial level to the base station via the common channel for the reverse<br>
link. The mobile station checks in step A2 whether a power control command is<br>
received from the base station via the common channel for the forward link. Upon<br>
failure to receive the power control command, the mobile station increases in step<br>
A3 the level (i.e., power) of the preamble signal by a predefined amount, on the<br>
judgement that the base station has failed to sense the preamble signal due to its<br>
lowness in power. Thereafter, the procedure returns to step A2. However, in the<br>
event where it is predetermined between the mobile station and the base station that<br>
the power control command are transmitted at a predefined time via the forward<br>
link, the step A3 may be omitted. Upon reception of the power control command<br>
from the base station, the mobile station sends in step A4 controls the level of the<br>
preamble signal according to the received power control command and sends the<br>
power controlled preamble signal to the base station. After sending the power<br>
controlled preamble signal, the mobiles station proceeds to step A5 to see if a<br>
predefined time TW has elapsed. When the predefined time TW has not elapsed yet,<br>
the mobile station compares the power of the received power control command with<br>
a threshold value, in step A6. When the power of the received power control<br>
command is equal to higher than the threshold value, the mobile station returns to<br>
step A4 and continues to send the preamble signal to the base station by controlling<br>
the power of the preamble signal according to the received power control command.<br>
However, the power of the received power control command is lower than the<br>
threshold value in step A6, the mobile station sends in step A7 the preamble signal,<br>
maintaining the previous power level. Subsequently, in step A8, the mobile station<br>
increase a count value CNT by one. Here, the count value CNT represents how<br>
many times the mobile station has sent the preamble signal in the previous power<br>
level. When the count value CNT is equal to or higher than a threshold value in step<br>
A9, the mobile station releases the reverse link common channel in step A11.<br>
However, when the count value CNT is lower than the threshold value, the<br>
procedure returns to the step A5. As stated above, when the power control<br>
command lower in level than the threshold value is received as many times as a<br>
predefined times, the mobile station discontinues sending the reverse link common<br>
channel to release it, on the judgement that the power control channel for the<br>
forward link is in a bad condition. In this exemplary embodiment, the mobile station<br>
releases the reverse link common channel by checking the receiving power of the<br>
power control command during transmission of the preamble signal. Of course,<br>
however, it is also possible to release the reverse link common channel even during<br>
transmission of the message, if the power control command channel is in the bad<br>
condition.<br>
In the meantime, when the predefined time TW has elapsed in step A5, the<br>
mobile station continuously receives, in step A10, the power control command from<br>
the base station and simultaneously sends an intended message to the base station<br>
via the reverse link common channel by controlling the transmission power<br>
according to the received power control command. After transmission of the<br>
message, the reverse link common channel is released in step A11.<br>
In FIG. 18A, the mobile station sends the preamble signal to the base station<br>
via the reverse link common channel prior to actually sending the message in step<br>
A10, and the base station then sends the power control command to the mobile<br>
station according to the receiving power of the preamble signal. In this manner, the<br>
initial power control is performed to adjust the power of the reverse link common<br>
channel to a desired extent. The purpose of the initial power control is to enable the<br>
mobile station to stably send the first several frames of the intended message.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 18B, the base station checks in step B1 whether the<br>
preamble signal is received from the mobile station. Upon failure to detect the<br>
preamble signal from the mobile station, the base station sends to the mobile station<br>
a power-up command for instructing an increase of the power for the reverse link,<br>
in step B7. This is to increase an initial acquisition probability by sending the<br>
power-up command to the mobile station in the case where the power of the reverse<br>
link is too low to receive the preamble signal. However, upon detection of the<br>
preamble signal from the mobile station, the base station measures the strength of<br>
the received preamble signal in step B2, and then sends a power control command<br>
to the mobile station according to the measurement in step B3. After that, the base<br>
station determines in step B4 whether the predefined time TW has elapsed, to return<br>
to the step B1 when the predefined time TW has not elapsed. However, after a lapse<br>
of the predefined time TW, the mobile station receives the message sent from the<br>
mobile station in step B5 and then releases the corresponding common channel in<br>
step B6. In the meantime, the base station sends the power control command to the<br>
mobile station even while receiving the message from the mobile station, so as to<br>
enable the mobile station to control the transmission power according to the power<br>
control command.<br>
FIGs. 19A and 19B are flow charts illustrating operations of the base station<br>
and the mobile station when a message is transmitted by power controlling the<br>
common channel for the reverse link according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. When compared with the embodiment shown in FIGs. 18A and<br>
18B, the embodiment of FIGs. 19A and 19B is different in that the base station<br>
informs the mobile station about a message transmission time during the initial<br>
power control between the base station and the mobile station.<br>
The procedure of FIG. 19A is equal to that of FIG. 18A except step C5<br>
which corresponds to step A5 of FIG. 18A. In step C5, the mobile station checks<br>
whether a message transmission command is received from the base station, in order<br>
to determine whether finish the initial power control and actually send the intended<br>
message.<br>
The procedure of FIG. 19B is equal to that of FIG. 18B except that step B4<br>
of FIG. 18B is replaced with steps D4 and D5. In step D4, the base station measures<br>
the strength (i.e., receiving power) of the preamble signal sent from the mobile<br>
station to determine whether the strength of the received signal is within a<br>
permissible range. If the strength of the received preamble signal is within the<br>
permissible range, the base station sends the message transmission command to the<br>
mobile station in step D5. Of course, even at this moment, the base station sends the<br>
power control command to the mobile station.<br>
FIGs. 20A and 20B are flow charts illustrating operations of the base station<br>
and the mobile station when a message is transmitted by power controlling the<br>
designated common channel for the reverse link according to further another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Even in this embodiment, the mobile station<br>
and the base station exchanges an actual message after performing the initial power<br>
control for the predefined time TW. However, since this embodiment performs the<br>
power control for the designated common channel only, a channel request and<br>
assignment operation for the designated common channel should precede.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20A, in step E1, the mobile station sends a channel request<br>
signal to the base station in order to use the designated channel. The mobile station<br>
can send information about a message to send, together with the channel request<br>
signal. The base station then analyzes the information sent from the mobile station<br>
to determine whether to use the designated reverse link common channel. When it<br>
is intended to use the designated reverse link common channel, the mobile station<br>
sends a channel assignment command and associated channel assignment<br>
information as a response signal via the forward link common channel (See steps<br>
F1, F2, F3 and F11 of FIG. 20B). The mobile station then receives the response<br>
signal in step E2, and determines is step E3 whether the response signal corresponds<br>
to an acknowledge signal ACK or a negative acknowledge signal NAK. Here, the<br>
ACK signal represents that the base station permits the mobile station to use the<br>
designated reverse link common channel, and the NACK signal represents that the<br>
base station does not permit the mobile station to use the designated reverse link<br>
common channel. Upon reception of the ACK signal, the mobile station starts<br>
sending the reverse link common channel in an initial power after a lapse of a<br>
predefined time TG. As shown in steps E4-E8 and E11-E14, after performing the<br>
initial power control for the predefined time TW, the mobile station sends the actual<br>
message. Since operations in steps E4-E9 and E11-E14 are equal to those in steps<br>
A1-A 10 of FIG. 18A, the associated descriptions will be avoided. After sending the<br>
message in step E9, the mobile station releases the designated common channel in<br>
step E10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20B, in step F1, the base station receives from the mobile<br>
station the channel request signal and the information about the message that the<br>
mobile station intends to send. In step F2, the base station analyzes the received<br>
information to determine whether or not to permit the mobile station to use the<br>
designated common channel for the reverse link. To permit the mobile station to use<br>
the designated common channel, the base station sends in step F3 the channel<br>
assignment command (i.e., ACK signal) and associated channel assignment<br>
information to the mobile station via the forward link common channel. On the<br>
other hand, to permit the mobile station not to use the designated common channel,<br>
the base station sends the NAK signal to the mobile station in step F11. In the<br>
meantime, after sending the ACK signal in step F3, the base station waits for the<br>
predefined time TG in step F4, taking into consideration the time in which the ACK<br>
signal reaches the mobile station. The initial power control procedure and the actual<br>
message receiving procedure in steps F5-F9 which will be performed after a lapse<br>
of the time TG, are equal to the procedures in steps B1-B5 of FIG. 18B. Thus, the<br>
detailed descriptions will be avoided. After receiving the message in step F9, the<br>
base station releases the designated common channel in step F10.<br>
FIGs. 21A and 21B are flow charts illustrating operations of the base station<br>
and the mobile station when a message is transmitted by power controlling the<br>
designated common channel for the reverse link according to further another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this exemplary embodiment, the base<br>
station informs the mobile station about the message transmission time during the<br>
initial power control between the mobile station and the base station, in the same<br>
way as in the embodiment of FIGs. 19A and 19B. Alternatively, the mobile station<br>
sends an intended message at a time predetermined between the mobile station and<br>
the base station. However, unlike the embodiment of FIGs. 19A and 19B, this<br>
embodiment performs the power control for the designated common channel only,<br>
a channel request and assignment operation for the designated common channel<br>
should precede.<br>
Referring to FIG. 21 A, in step G1, the mobile station sends a channel request<br>
message to the base station in order to use the designated common channel. The<br>
mobile station can send information about the message to send, together with the<br>
channel request message. The base station then analyzes the information sent from<br>
the mobile station to determine whether to use the designated reverse link common<br>
channel. When it is intended to use the designated reverse link common channel,<br>
the mobile station sends a channel assignment command and associated channel<br>
assignment information as a response signal via the forward link common channel<br>
(See steps H1, H2, H3 and H12 of FIG. 21B). The mobile station then receives the<br>
response signal in step G2, and determines is step G3 whether the response signal<br>
corresponds to an acknowledge signal ACK or a negative acknowledge signal NAK.<br>
Here, the ACK signal represents that the base station permits the mobile station to<br>
use the designated reverse link common channel, and the NACK signal represents<br>
that the base station does not permit the mobile station to use the designated reverse<br>
link common channel. Upon reception of the ACK signal, the mobile station<br>
performs the initial power control and then sends the intended message at a<br>
predetermined time or upon reception of a message transmission command from the<br>
base station, as shown in steps G4-G13. Since procedures in steps G4-G13 are equal<br>
to those in steps C1-C10 of FIG. 19A, the detailed descriptions will be avoided.<br>
After sending the message in step G13, the mobile station releases the designated<br>
common channel in step G14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 21B, in step H1, the base station receives from the mobile<br>
station the channel request signal and the information about the message that the<br>
mobile station intends to send. In step H2, the base station analyzes the received<br>
information to determine whether or not to permit the mobile station to use the<br>
designated common channel for the reverse link. To permit the mobile station to use<br>
the designated common channel, the base station sends in step H3 the channel<br>
assignment command (i.e., ACK signal) and associated channel assignment<br>
information to the mobile station via the forward link common channel. On the<br>
other hand, to permit the mobile station not to use the designated common channel,<br>
the base station sends the NAK signal to the mobile station in step H11. In the<br>
meantime, after sending the ACK signal in step H3, the base station waits for the<br>
predefined time TG in step H4, taking into consideration the time in which the ACK<br>
signal reaches the mobile station. The initial power control procedure and the actual<br>
message receiving procedure in steps H5-H9 which will be performed after a lapse<br>
of the time TG, are equal to the procedures in steps D1-D6 of FIG. 19B. Thus, the<br>
detailed descriptions will be avoided. After receiving the message in step H10, the<br>
base station releases the designated common channel in step H11.<br>
FIGs. 22A through 25B show several methods of transmitting a message<br>
according to the present invention. More specifically, there are shown several<br>
examples of controlling the power during a standby state after transmission of the<br>
message. In the drawings, PA denote a preamble and MSG denotes a message to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
FIGs. 22A and 22B show methods of transmitting an intended message by<br>
dividing it into several message blocks of a predetermined size. After sending one<br>
message block, the mobile station sends a next message block upon reception of the<br>
ACK signal and resends the message block upon reception of the NAK signal or<br>
upon failure to receive the ACK signal for a predefined time. The mobile station<br>
does not control the power during a standby state after sending one message block.<br>
Therefore, before sending the next message block or resending the transmitted<br>
message block, the mobile station should send the preamble for the initial power<br>
control. FIG. 22A shows a method for transmitting the message in the case where<br>
the pilot channel is not used in the reverse link, and FIG. 22B shows a method for<br>
transmitting the message in the case where the pilot channel is used in the reverse<br>
link. The structure and operation for the cases where the pilot channel is used or not<br>
used in the reverse link have been described with reference FIGs. 8A to 14.<br>
FIGs. 23 A and 23B show methods of transmitting an intended message by<br>
dividing it into several message blocks of a predetermined size in the same manner<br>
as FTGs. 22A and 22B. After sending one message block, the mobile station sends<br>
a next message block upon reception of the ACK signal and resends the message<br>
block upon reception of the NAK signal or upon failure to receive the ACK signal<br>
for a predefined time. These message transmission methods are different from the<br>
methods of FIGs. 22A and 22B in that the mobile station controls the power at a<br>
pause after transmission of one message block. In this case, since the power is<br>
controlled even at the pause between the message blocks being transmitted, it is not<br>
necessary to send the preamble signal to control the initial power when transmitting<br>
the next message block of retransmitting the transmitted message block. In<br>
particular, FIG. 23B shows the case where the pilot channel of the reverse link is<br>
continuously transmitted for the power control of the reverse link, even for the<br>
duration where there is no message to transmit.<br>
FIGs. 24A and 24B show methods of waiting for the ACK signal to be<br>
received after sending the whole intended message at a time. In these methods, the<br>
power is not controlled while waiting for the ACK signal to be received. Therefore,<br>
when the NAK signal is received or when the ACK signal is not received for the<br>
predefined time, the mobile station sends the preamble signal for the initial power<br>
control prior to retransmitting the message. FIG. 24A shows a method for<br>
transmitting the message in the case where the pilot channel is not used in the<br>
reverse link, and FIG. 22B shows a method for transmitting the message in the case<br>
where the pilot channel is used in the reverse link.<br>
FIGs. 25A and 25B show methods of divisionally transmitting an intended<br>
message into several message blocks of a predetermined size and receiving ACK<br>
signals for the respective message block transmitted. In accordance with these<br>
methods, upon failure to receive the ACK signal for a predefined time or upon<br>
reception of the NAK signal, the mobile station should retransmit the message block<br>
in one of the following two methods: a first method retransmits only the message<br>
for which the NAK signal is received and the message for which the ACK signal is<br>
not received for the predefined time; a second method retransmits all the message<br>
blocks succeeding the message block for which the NAK signal is received or for<br>
which the ACK signal is received for the predefined time. For example, assume that<br>
the ACK signal for a third message block is not received for the predefined time or<br>
the NAK signal for the third message block is received during transmission of a fifth<br>
message block. In this case, the first method retransmits only the third message<br>
block after transmitting the fifth message block, and the second method retransmits<br>
the third to fifth message blocks after transmitting the fifth message block. FIG. 25 A<br>
shows the message transmission method in the case where the pilot channel is not<br>
used in the reverse link and FIG. 25B shows message transmission method in the<br>
case where the pilot channel is used in the reverse link.<br>
In the present invention, the forward common power control channel is<br>
proposed for the power control of the reverse link common channel. The forward<br>
common power control channel can be also used for another purpose. As another<br>
application, the forward common power control channel can be used for power<br>
control of the control channels. In the IMT-2000 system, dedicated control channels<br>
are employed to increase a call quality of the mobile station and to secure an<br>
efficient data communication. In general, there is no difficulty in applying a<br>
dedicated control channel for the reverse link to the system. However, when<br>
forward link dedicated control channels are assigned to the respective mobile<br>
stations, the orthogonal codes are assigned for the respective forward link dedicated<br>
control channels, resulting in exhaustion of the orthogonal codes.<br>
To reduce the number of the orthogonal codes assigned for the forward link<br>
dedicated control channels, the present invention uses the common control channel<br>
(or a sharable control channel) which can be shared by multiple mobiles stations on<br>
a time-shared (or time-division) basis. In a system using the common control<br>
channel, a single orthogonal code is assigned to the common control channel and<br>
multiple subscribers transmit/receive control information using the common control<br>
channel. Here, the subscribers can be distinguished by scrambling transmission data<br>
using different long codes. However, since one channel, i.e., one orthogonal channel<br>
is used by several subscribers on a time-shared basis, it is difficult to transmit the<br>
power control command for the reverse link. It is possible to transmit the power<br>
control command via the common power control channel, as in the power control<br>
for the reverse link common channel. Therefore, by transmitting the power control<br>
command via the separate common power control channel, it is possible to transmit<br>
the power control command without wasting the orthogonal code when there is no<br>
data to transmit. Furthermore, in the novel common power control channel scheme,<br>
the several subscribers transmit and receive their corresponding power control<br>
commands by sharing the same orthogonal code, so that it is possible to control the<br>
power with the reduced number of the orthogonal codes.<br>
Here, for a structure in which the base station simultaneously transmits the<br>
common control channel and the common power control channel to the mobile<br>
station and a structure in which the mobile station simultaneously receives the two<br>
channels, the schemes shown in FIGs. 11-17 can be used.<br>
In the light of the foregoing descriptions, since the power control is<br>
performed through the reverse link common channel, a time to access the system<br>
can be reduced and the system can transmit even a long bust message. Furthermore,<br>
an initial system access power can be appropriately adjusted, minimizing an<br>
influence on the system. In addition, the novel CDMA communication system<br>
transmits the power control commands for multiple subscribers via the common<br>
power control channel using a single orthogonal code, thereby increasing utility<br>
efficiencies of the orthogonal codes. Therefore, it is possible to transmit the power<br>
control commands with the reduced number of the orthogonal codes being used.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
