				<td>4. DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of electrical power supply feeders, detection and prevention of theft, faults and accidents thereof and distribution system automation.<br>
Prior art of Unauthorized withdrawal or theft of electrical power from electrical feeder:<br>
The prevalent system is unable to stop this menace because it is difficult to detect from substation whether the withdrawal  is authorized or unauthorized. Only an on-site physical examination of power feeder(s) or subscriber feeder(s) may help in detecting theft. Also, theft may occur at any time on any feeder.<br>
Prior art of Fault(s) on electrical feeder(s): In "single phase' feeder circuit line (L) to ground (G) fault can occur. In 'three phase' feeder circuit, L to G, L to L (LL), LL to G, LL to L (LLL), and LLL to G fault may occur. If any of these faults occurs, then an electrical fuse/ over current relay or circuit breaker at tlie feeder substation or at the distribution transformer will operate and will disrupt the supply of the complete feeder. The operating point of these fuse units or that of over current relay is usually much higher than the rated load current usually 1 50 to 200%.<br>
Prior art of Accidents due to electrical power feeder(s): Many a times accidents due to overhead electrical power feeder occurs due to following reasons:<br>
(i)	The   body   of a   bird   sitting   on   live   electrical   power   feeder   phase<br>
wire/conductor touches neutral/ ground / another phase wire/conductor,<br>
(ii)	The   body  of a   bird   sitting   on   live   electrical   power   feeder   phase <br>
wire/conductor touches body of another bird sitting on neutral/ ground / i another phase wire/conductor, (iii)       The maintenance personnel doing routine maintenance job touches a live phase wire while his body is grounded or touching neutral/ another phase wire.  (iv)       During storms etc., when any live feeder wire breaks and fall on ground, any human being or animal etc. touching it may die due to electric shock etc. Prior art of distribution system automation: Distribution system automation has been done in some countries using power line communication. Due to switching disturbances on power line, the range of such a communication is limited to lew hundred meters.  Also due to low impedance on power line, the power line modem consumes large power for communication of signals on power lines. Summary of Invention: The present invention provides a system and method for detection,  prevention of accidents, faults and unauthorized withdrawal or theft of electrical power on power lines or power feeders and automation of electrical power distribution system.

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments:	<br>
Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the j particular arrangements shown since the invention is capable of other embodiments. Also the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.<br>
This invention consists of a 'basic system' (BS). an "enhanced system' (ES) and a j<br>
 "further enhanced system" (FES).	<br>
	Basic System<br>
 FIG. 1 shows block diagram of a radial feeder with "three phase' evaluation cum signal , units (El, E2, E3, E7, E8, E9 and E10), 'single phase' evaluation cum signal units (E4, E5. E6), 'three phase' signals units (3ØS), 'single phase' signal units (10S), 'three phase' signal inputs (3Ø, 3Øa, 3Øb, 3Øc,... 3Øn), "single phase' signal inputs (1Ø, 1Øa, 1Øb, 1Øc,... 1Øn) and their respective connections using signal wire. The 'single phase' signal inputs are further of three types as shown in the FIG.2.   They are (R0a, RØb, RØc... RØn; YØa, YØb, YØc,.. Y0n; BØa, BØb, BØc,... BØn). While these  "single phase' signal inputs connect the respective signal wire to the evaluation unit, the signal comes on signal wire with respect to respective phase feeder wire. Also, the "three phase' signal wire carries the signal from signal unit to evaluation unit with  respect to a feeder wire (any phase wire or neutral; e.g. R phase wire has been taken in  this system but it is not limited to R phase).    The 'three phase' evaluation unit(s) has  provision of'three phase' signal wire(s) input as well as 'single phase' signal wire(s) input, whereas 'single phase' evaluation units have provision of only "single phase' signal wire input. Also shown in FIG. 1 is a star-star transformer 67. However, the<br>
system holds good for a star-delta, delta-delta, delta-star transformer. In FIG. 1, two  points of common coupling (PCC) are shown viz. 59 and 63. In 59, E2 is the main evaluation cum signal unit which in conjunction with E3, E4, E5, E6 and E7 protects 59 from occurrence of events of claim I. F.2 is receiving signals from evaluation cum signal units E3, E4, E5, E6 and E7. E3 is receiving signal from "three phase' signal unit which is embedded in energy meter of 'three phase' load 63. E3 protects feeder part 55 from occurrence of events of claim 1 in conjunction with 30S signal unit at 63. Similarly, E4, E5 and E6 are 'single phase' signal cum evaluation unit which are also receiving signal from 'single phase' signal units embedded in respective 'single phase' energy meters of loads at 64, 65 and 66 and protects feeder part 56, 57 and 58 in conjunction with respective signal units. El evaluation unit and E7 signal cum evaluation units are receiving signals from signal units in E2 and E8 and are protecting<br><br>
 feeder part 54 and 60 respectively with their conjunction. At the second PC 63, protection against events is provided by E8 in conjunction with E9 and E10.  Similarly, <br>
 E9 and E10 protects feeder part 61 and 62 respectively in conjunction with signal units <br>
at the other end of respective feeder(s).  Thus, in general the whole distribution system <br>
 can be protected by the system.<br>
FIG. 2 shows modular connectors for signal and evaluation units of the system. The <br>
"single phase' signal unit and signal input to evaluation unit will each have only one<br>
such connector assembly (16 or 17 or 18 type) depending upon the phase of the feeder<br>
whose signal is to be transmitted.   If phase R current signal is to be transmitted, then<br>
connector assembly 16 and 16M is used at both ends of the signal wire.  Similarly, for <br>
Y and B phase, 17 and 18 type connector assemblies are used. The side view of the <br>
male connector is shown in 19. This shows that the lever at its head is required to be <br>
pressed for removing the male connector out of its female counterpart.   Thus, this <br>
locking mechanism helps in avoiding any loose connections at site with changing <br>
weather conditions etc. The 'three phase' signal unit and signal input to evaluation unit <br>
will each be having connector assembly 15 and 15M type at both ends of its signal <br>
wire. The 'three phase' signal cum evaluation unit can cater to both 'single phase" and <br>
'three phase' feeder protection like E2 in FIG. I. Thus, an array of such connector<br>
assemblies can be used in such evaluation units. Each connector assembly has different <br>
shape, such that one type of male connectors will not fit into the other type female units<br>
but only into its own type. The circuit behind a mixture of such connector assembly is <br>
shown in FIG. 7 and 8.	<br>
FIG.3 shows 'three phase' radial feeder system with detailed block diagram of signal j unit 25 and that of evaluation unit 26 and with 'three phase' four wire theft 23a, 'single phase' theft 23b, 'three phase' three wire theft 23c (one type of events). As shown in this figure, 22 is a 'three phase' A.C. source feeding 'three phase' load 21. Thus, load 21 is authorized withdrawal of power. However, unauthorized withdrawal i.e. theft 23a j or 23b or 23c or a combination thereof may also take place. The load 21  is at subscriber's end and the signal unit 25 is embedded in subscriber's energy meter. The 'three phase' signal unit 25 consists of current sensor(s) 2a, triple I to V converter la . and triple input summer 3a and miniature circuit breaker (MCB) 7a and connector assembly 27a. The signal wire 24 is connected to signal unit and evaluation unit via connector assembly 27a and 27b respectively.    The 'three phase' evaluation unit consists of current sensor unit 2b; Triple 1 to V converter, lb; quad input summer circuit 3b;   'single phase'  full  wave rectifier 20; comparator 4-  opto-isotator 4b; controlled firing circuit 8; three triacs or controlled switches 6.    The triple 1 to V converter la or lb consist of three 1 to V converters one each for each phase as shown in FIG. 4. The detailed circuit of la and lb is shown in FIG. 4 but is not limited to these.   The quad input summer circuit consists of triple input summer circuit and a fourth input transmitted by 3a via signal wire. The output of 3a is proportional to<br>
(Equation Removed) where 1R, lY and In are currents in 'three phase' or line wires of its<br>
proximity feeder but is not limited to this combination of currents. Many such combinations are possible. This is one typical combination of phase or line currents 1R, IY and IB. R phase of the feeder has been used in these circuits to deliver the signal unit ground or datum to evaluation unit. Any other phase of the feeder or neutral wire can : also be used to deliver the ground or datum. The block 3b of evaluation unit will first generate a signal proportional to currents in its proximity feeder i.e. proportional lo<br>
(Equation Removed)and will then add it to the signal obtained from 3a.  If any event as <br><br>
described in claim 1 is not occurring in the feeder part between the signal unit 25 and evaluation unit 26, then the output of 3b is zero approx. and not otherwise. The operational amplifiers in la, lb, 3a and 3b are given bipolar power supply so that the <br><br>
occurrence of the event in any half cycle is detected and prevented. The rectifier cum <br>
capacitor 20 will convert the signal into uni-polar (direct current) type and is then <br>
normally compared with zero voltage in comparator 4.   If the feeder wire is having a<br>
long span or leakage current due to cable etc. exists, then the signal can be compared<br>
with some permissible voltage using the voltage divider circuit of 4a in FIG. 4.   The<br>
circuit of 4a has two switches S1 and S2. In case there is no leakage current etc. and the<br>
permissible limit is zero, then switch SI can be turned ON and switch S2 can be turned<br>
OFF.   In case due to any reason, a non-zero permissible limit exists, then SI can be<br>
turned OFF and S2 can be turned ON. Also, the lower resistance in the voltage divider<br>
circuit can be adjusted for moving the trip point of the comparator.   If the currents at <br>
the ends of the feeder under consideration are different and hence the proportional <br>
signals as observed by signal unit and the evaluation unit of the system is more than the <br>
permissible limit due to occurrence of any of the events in claim 1 etc., output of <br>
comparator 4 will be high and zero otherwise (The comparator is given uni-polar power <br>
supply).  The output of comparator is connected to an opto-isolator 4b.  The transistor <br>
of opto-isolator turns ON when output of comparator is high and not otherwise. An ON <br>
transistor will not allow the capacitor of relaxation oscillator of 5 to charge and thus the <br>
controlled firing circuit will not give triggering pulses to Triacs and the controlled I<br>
switches will hence turn OFF or in other words the concerned feeder part and hence its <br>
dependent feeders will be thus de-energized.    The firing angle of TRIAC(s) when in <br>
ON state is zero. The power supply for operational amplifiers etc. of evaluation unit is <br>
obtained from the part of feeder between the controlled switches and 'three phase' a.c. <br>
source. TRIAC is a normally OFF device and require triggering pulse to turn ON. i<br>
Instead of TRIAC(s), any other solid state bidirectional switch or a combination of <br>
unidirectional   switch(es)   or   controlled   'Normally   open'   bilateral   switch(es)   or <br>
controlled  'Normally closed'  bilateral  switch(es) can  be  used.     Accordingly,  the <br>
driver/firing/triggering circuit after comparator will change.	<br>
FIG.5   shows   'single  phase'   system   with   detailed   block  diagram   of signal   and  evaluation unit with 'single phase' theft (event).<br>
FIG.6  shows  detailed  circuit diagram  of 'single  phase'   system  with  signal   and <br>
evaluation units and 'single phase' theft (event).	<br>
The discussion of operation of these circuits is on the same lines as that of 'three phase'<br>
circuit, as discussed above except that the I-V converter consists of a single unit and<br>
generates a voltage signal proportional to the 'single phase' current of the feeder in<br>
proximity to the unit. The summer circuit has only two input signals, one generated by j<br>
28a and second by 28b.	<br>
FIG. 7 shows detailed circuit diagram of 'three phase' evaluation unit when a combination of one 'three phase' and one each 'single phase' signals are connected to evaluation unit. The collector(s) of the transistor(s) of opto-isolator are connected together and emitter(s) are also connected together to the capacitor of relaxation  oscillator. If any event as specified in claim 1 occurs at the feeder protected by this  evaluation unit, then the corresponding transistor(s) will turn ON and will stop firing pulses and hence de-energize the concerned feeder.<br>
FIG.  8  shows detailed circuit diagram  of 'three phase'  evaluation  unit when  a combination of two 'three phase' (30a, 30b) and two R phase (R0a, R0b) and one  each other 'single phase' signals are connected to the evaluation unit.   This requires  addition of one more input connection at the summer of the respective 'three phase' or  R phase circuit at 3bb and 35a respectively. Thus, the additional connections have been connected through a resistance to the respective summer operational amplifier as at 3bb or 35a respectively.  Thus, any number of signals of 'three phase' or any "single phase' can be added to the 'three phase' evaluation unit by the addition of a module consisting of a male female connector assembly, an MCB and a resistance with connection to j summer circuit.    This not only makes the design modular but also the additional modules are cheaper. FIG.9 shows block diagram of ring feeder with evaluation and signal units. The power <br>
is fed to the ring feeder via master evaluation unit (MEU). The MEU consists of bilateral controlled switches (Normally open or normally closed type). The state of these controlled switches decides whether the ring feeder and its dependent feeders will be energized or not. If the controlled switches are ON, then the ring feeder and its dependent feeders are energized and not otherwise. The MEU also has a high frequency 'signal source' whose signal flows through the signal wire and a ring feeder wire. The signal wire as shown in the figure. It starts from MEU, traverses along with the feeder conductor and returns back to the MEU. The ring feeder is divided into two different type of parts viz. part(s) without PCC and part(s) consisting of PCC. The first signal unit is in the MEU itself. As the signal wire has to carry two signals; viz signal from signal unit at a frequency same as that of power a.c. current and signal "from 'signal source' of high frequency. The flow of these signals is controlled by two type of filters viz.<br>
a)	low pass filter (LPF) which allows signal from signal unit(s) to flow up to the<br>
signal input of evaluation unit(s) but prohibits the signal from signal source to<br>
pass through it,<br>
b)	high pass filter (HPF) which allows signal from signal source to pass through it<br>
but prohibits signal from signal unit(s)<br>
Besides the LPF and HPF, the REU also has a 'normally closed' controlled switch in the path of signal wire carrying only high frequency signal. This controlled switch does not comes in the path of signal from signal unit. If any event as claimed in claim 1 occurs at the concerned feeder part, then the control unit in REU will turn OFF the controlled switch. This will not allow the high frequency signal from signal source to reach its destination in the MEU. As shown in FIG. 10, if the signal source signal does not reach rectifier 50 in MEU, its output will be zero and therefore the relaxation oscillator 51 will not be powered and therefore no firing pulses goes to TRIACs 53. Therefore, the ring feeder will be de-energized on the occurrence of any event as claimed in claim 1 and not otherwise. Instead of TRIACs at 53, any other type of controlled bilateral switches, relays etc. can also be connected and the driver circuit changed accordingly. The signal unit and evaluation unit in REU is similar to that of radial feeder in its design except the fact that the evaluation unit of REU is different only in the following respect: The output of comparator controls the state of controlled 'normally ON' bilateral switch in the path of high frequency signal. The radial feeders drawing power from ring feeder will have same system as discussed for radial feeders.<br>
FIG. 11 and 12 shows detailed circuit diagram of 'basic system' as applied to 'three phase' and 'single phase' ring system respectively without MCB, connector assembly and filter circuits. But, they too exist and have not been drawn in order to highlight the basic ring signal system.<br>
The resistances in the I to V converter circuit and summer circuit etc. has to be so chosen in consideration with current sensor ratio such that the operational amplifiers are able to process the signals without any attenuation taking place for all range of expected load current(s). Also the maximum signal level should be less than ten percent of maximum allowed by operational amplifiers. The gain of each filter circuit should be 1.0.<br>
Enhanced System<br>
The 'basic system' detects and prevents event(s) with a maximum time lag of half a cycle of supply. The severity of different events is different. For example, the system must be protected against severe event like fault(s). FIG. 13 and 14 shows detailed block diagram of 'enhanced system' as applied to radial and ring feeder respectively. These figures show distribution control unit (DCU), 95 communicating in wireless configuration to distribution management unit (DMU). The DCU can:<br>
a.   Communicate with DMU(s) using wireless communication, analyze<br>
	the data of power flow, voltage and current received from each DMU<br><br>
and respective PU(s).<br>
b.	retrieve power, energy, harmonic, power factor, currents), voltage(s)<br>

DMU can sense the current (single arrow connectors) and voltage (double arrow<br>
connectors) from voltage and current sensing and control unit (VCSCU1) and can also<br>
perform load management using control signal(s) (CSn, n = 1,2,3...), as shown in detail<br>
in FIG. 15, if load on a particular transformer exceeds its capability. A processor unit<br>
(PUn, n = 1,2,3,...) is installed on each point of common coupling (PCC). The PU can:<br>
a.   sense current(s) and voltage(s) in analog form from all authorized<br>
connections at point of common coupling and then converting them to<br>
digital form using multi-channel analog to digital converter, calculate<br>
online power (active and reactive), energy, power factor and harmonics<br>
injected by each authorized connection at the point of common<br>
coupling and storing in memory of PU placed on the point of common<br>
coupling(s) and then making them available to DMU such that the<br>
communication between the DMU and PU initialized by DMU with the<br>
help of wired modems with communication signals flowing on a live<br>
	phase wire and a signal wire.	<br><br>
b.	control the energizing of the feeders fed from the point of common<br>
coupling for different conditions like normal, under voltage, over<br>
voltage etc.<br>
c.	operating  the   controlled   switches   for  feeder  maintenance,   load<br>
balancing, load management, VAR compensation    capacitor banks,<br>
street light, pumps and reporting their status to DCU,<br>
d.	store tariff information received from DMU and calculate and store<br>
billing and other account information of each subscriber being fed from<br>
PCC.<br>
e.	event recording of circuit breaker operation etc. and their reporting to<br>
DCU<br>
f.	transmit using signal and a phase wire between PCC and subscriber the<br>
tariff, billing, account information, current, voltage on feeding phase,<br>
power (active and reactive) withdrawn, energy consumed, harmonics<br>
injected, past load, energy profile etc. information with the help of a<br>
universal asynchronous receiver (UAR) to a display unit (DU) installed<br>
on subscriber end of the feeder.<br>
These PU(s) can sense voltage and current readings from incoming, outgoing as well as from subscriber's feeder connected to PCC. The PU(s) and DMU will control the 'normally open' (NO) controlled switches located in VCSCU1, VCSCU+EU+BU1, VCSCU+EU1, VCSCU3, VCSCU+EU+BU2, VCSCU+EU2, VCSCU5 and will sense voltage after these 'NO' switches in order to know the actual state of each switch. Also, as shown in FIG. 15, Feeder3 can be fed from transformer 116 or transformer 117 depending upon the state of NO3 and NO4 as per the status of control signals CS3 and CS4. As shown in Fig 13 and 14, the DMU will be observing the power flowing or loading of transformer from the sensor signals received from VCSCU1. As shown in FIG. 13, the 'NO' switches can be controlled by 'CS', therefore, all or any or any combination of the feeder(s) after DMU or respective PU can be de-energized due to occurrence of any event or for maintenance etc. without affecting the non-dependent feeders. The VCSCU+ evaluation unit (EU) + load balancer unit (BUI or 2), in the path of single phase feeder can be controlled by respective PU for load balancing as shown in detail in FIG. 16. In such a case, the single phase load can be connected to any one of the three phases (R or Y or B) or it can be disconnected for maintenance etc. as per the digital control output signals P and Q.<br>
The DMU will be polling the PU(s) and the information collected or calculated by respective PU about the concerned feeders can be retrieved by DMU and stored in its memory. This information can then be transmitted to Distribution control centre by the DMU. Both DMU and PU has on-board or on-chip an multi channel analog to digital converter (ADC) to convert sensed voltage and current to equivalent digital, real time clock (RTC) to record the date and time of event or readings of voltage, current and power and energy etc., digital input output (DIO) to give control signals to control units etc. Electrically erasable programmable read only memory to store energy readings of each subscriber, control signal(s) status etc., random access memory (RAM) to store current and voltage samples or partial results during calculations, modulator (MOD2 or MODI) and demodulator (DEMOD1 or DEMOD2) for duplex communication between DMU and PU. The BPF1 in DMU allows signals coming from any MODI of PU to pass through it and reach the DEMOD1 of DMU. Similarly, the BPF2 in each PU allows signals coming from DMU to pass through it to the DEMOD2 of PU. DMU also has a modem (MODEM) to communicate wirelessly with Distribution control unit. In FIG 13 or 14, if any event occurs on feeder 55, 58 or 61 or 69, then it is taken care by respective basic system. In FIG 13, if an event occurs at feeder 75 or PCC (59), then it gets reported in the difference of current or power readings as accessed by DMU and PU1 and hence is taken care by controlling switches in VCSCU1 by DMU as commanded by DCC. Similarly if the event occurs on feeder 60 or PCC (71), it gets reported in the current reading(s) delivered by PU1 and PU2 to DMU and is taken care<br><br>
by controlling the switches in VCSCU3 by PU1 as commanded by DCC through DMU. In FIG 14, if the event occurs at feeder 73 or 74, then it is reflected in the readings obtained from VCSCU1, VCSCU2 and VCSCU5 and can be controlled by DMU through control switches in VCSCU1. If the event occurs on feeder 60, then it is reflected in the readings obtained from VCSCU3 and VCSCU4 and can be controlled" by PU1 and PU2. Each PU can transmit tariff, billing, account, current, voltage on feeding phase, power (active and reactive) withdrawn, energy consumed, harmonics injected, past load, energy profile etc. information with the help of a universal asynchronous receiver (UAR) to a display unit (DU) installed on each subscriber end of the feeder as shown in FIG. 17a. This information is transmitted using the signal wire and a phase wire. All the events can be displayed by graphical user interface (GUI) software on display(s) at 'distribution control centre' and recorded in the database along with the instant of their occurrence etc.<br>
Further Enhanced System<br>
In 'enhanced system' the retrieving of readings by DCC from each DMU and from each PU through corresponding DMU and detection of event on main feeder by DCC can take some time and hence detection and prevention of such events may depend upon the speed of access or number of PU(s) i.e. size of system etc.; but, it has the flexibility to wink at some events (as per the agreement between utility and subscribers) or keeping in view the comfort level to be provided to the subscribers)) and take action at same or other events depending on the place and instant of their occurrence etc.<br>
On the other hand, the basic system instantly detects and prevents occurrence of events. Thus, the 'basic system' can be used to detect and prevent severe events and 'enhanced system' can be used to detect and prevent moderate events with flexibility from distribution control centre. Hence, the 'basic system' and 'enhanced system' can be combined together to make 'further enhanced system' as shown in FIG. 18 and 19 for radial and ring feeders respectively. As shown in FIG. 18, the signal from signal unit of 121 is transmitted via PU1 to VCSCU+E7 (120). Also flows on signal wire 103, the two way communication signal coming from DMU for PU2, PU3,... Similarly, the signal from signal unit of 119 flows on 102 to 118 via DMU. Also flows on signal wire 102, the two way communication signal coming from DMU for PU1, PU2, PU3,... The DMU (123), PU1 (124) and PU2 (125) of FIG. 18 are different from DMU (96), PU1(99) and PU2 (126) of FIG. 13 respectively as the former include a low pass filter (LPF) in addition to the components in latter. Similarly units 118, 120 and 122 in FIG. 18 are different from 97, 100 and 108 in FIG. 13 respectively as the former include a three phase signal input and evaluation unit in addition to the components in latter. In 124 and 125 of Fig. 18, two components viz. band pass filter (to allow frequencies of MODI and MOD2 to pass through it) and a low pass filter (to allow frequencies of power a.c. current to pass through it) are additional in comparison to 99 and 126 of Fig. 13. In 123 of Fig. 18, low pass filter (to allow the frequencies of power a.c. current to pass through) is additional compared to 96 of FIG. 13. Thus, in FIG. 18, both 'basic system' as well as 'enhanced system' has been included to add the flexibility in operation in response to events. Each PU can transmit tariff, billing, account, current, voltage on feeding phase, power (active and reactive) withdrawn, energy consumed, harmonics injected, past load, energy profile etc. information with the help of a universal asynchronous receiver (UAR) to a display unit (DU) installed on each subscriber end of the feeder as shown in FIG. 17b. This information is transmitted using the signal wire and a phase wire.<br>
The load balancer unit is controlled by respective PU. The signal unit in the evaluation unit of subscriber feeder at the PCC in such a case will be of three phase type instead of<br><br>
single phase type as it is not known to which phase the load will be connected instantly. This is shown in FIG. 16, FIG. 18 and 19 respectively. In 133 and 139 of FIG 19, band pass filter to allow frequencies of MODI, MOD2 as well as frequency of signal source to pass through it is additional in comparison to 150 and 157 of FIG. 14.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
