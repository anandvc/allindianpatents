				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an electrolyte composition useful for detecting and determining the presence of gases having reducing properties in a gas stream. This invention particularly relates to an improved electrolyte useful for the detection and determination of the presence of gases such as SO , H S and CO having reducing properties in a gas stream.  The 2  electrolyte of the present invention can also be used for the determination of the amount of such gases present in the process gas streams.<br>
Due to increased activity in the chemical industries for production of industrial chemicals there is a need for producing more and more reducing gases. The gases so produced are not completely utilised in the process and major part of such gases are released to the atmosphere causing air pollution problems. In addition process efficiency is also decreased. Hence it is very essential and important either to restrict the formation of such polluting gases or to monitor the formation of such gases to a certain limit and use in the process itself, thereby improving the efficiency of the process. Various methods such as Cou-lometry, spectrophotometry, thermal conductivity, pulse fluros-cense etc are used for the measurement of gases having reducing properties.<br>
Although various other methods such as spectrophotometry, thermal conductivity, pulse fluroscence etc are also used for the determination and detection of gases having reducing properties<br>
such as SO , the coulometric method is considered the most drift 2<br>
free, wet chemical method and has less interference from other gases. Among the various methods Coulometric method is consid-<br><br>
ered as the most drift free, and has less interference from other<br>
gases.<br>
The other advantages of the coulometric technique are:<br>
*	It is simple, accurate and low cost.<br>
*	It  is  amenable  for automation  and measurement of  high<br>
and  low concentration.<br>
*	It can give trouble free operation for long duration.<br>
*	It does not require frequent calibration.<br>
The principle of coulometric technique has been employed for the determination of high as well as low (ppm) concentrations of<br>
gases having reducing properties such as SO gas in the process<br>
gas streams.<br>
Currently the presence of gases having reducing properties in gas streams is determined and/or detected using an electro¬chemical type gas analyser employing an electrolyte (composi¬tion) . Literature survey recommends a system based on Bro¬mine-Bromide electrolyte for the determination of gases having<br>
reducing properties  in a gas stream at  ppm/ppb level.    The<br>
-6 concentration of Bromine used is of the order of  10 M.   For<br>
determining high concentration of gases having reducing proper¬ty, the use of Bromine containing electrolyte is not suitable due to the loss of Bromine during estimation (due to its volatility) causing errors in measurement.<br>
Other type  of electrolyte available for the determination<br>
of gases having reducing property such as SO  is based on the use<br>
of Pyridine, Iodine and Methanol (Karl-Fischer type). Iodine is used as an oxidising agent and methanol as a solvent for iodine.<br>
Pyridine  serves as a base to neutralise any acid  formed during estimation. This electrolyte can be used for the determination of<br>
gases having reducing properties such as SO  and not suitable for<br>
other gases such as H S, CO etc having reducing properties.<br>
The electrolyte containing pyridine has the following disadvan¬tages.<br>
1.	The presence of Pyridine present in the electrolyte gives  a<br>
bad odour which is a undesirable.<br>
2.	The  electrolyte is sensitive  to  excess  moisture.    Hence<br>
it reguires  rest time  (of upto 30 mts)  in between succes¬<br>
sive determinations.<br>
3.	The electrolyte has  limited  life expectancy and has to<br>
be changed every 24 hours.   This will  increase the  cost<br>
of operation.<br>
4.	The cost of the solution  is US$800 per litre.  (Reguirement<br>
is 150mL per day)<br>
The presence of reducing gas in the gas stream is detected by passing the gas through the electrochemical type gas analyser incorporating the said electrolyte(composition).<br>
An embodiment of the electrochemical type analyser is shown in fig 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification. The analyser usually consists of a cell with two sets of elec¬trodes immersed in the electrolyte. One set of electrode called the sensing electrodes(l) measure the ratio of the constituents in the electrolyte solution in terms of micro-amps. The other set of electrodes called generating electrodes(2) through which DC current is passed to restore the original ratio of the constitu¬ents which gets altered by the passage of gas stream containing<br>
the gases having reducing properties.<br>
With ' L ' shaped platinum sensing electrodes, it is possible to measure the current generated due to particular constituents ratio present in the solution. The generator electrodes are also made of platinum and used for the restoration of the constituents ratio by electrolysis. In order to avoid error in the sensing current measurement due to the generation of hydrogen during electrolysis, the generator electrodes are separated using a sintered glass disc (3). The electrolyte present in the anode side is called the anolyte (4) and that in the cathode side is called the catholyte (5). The anolyte and catholyte may be the same or different.<br>
The sampled gas(7) or the standard gas from a cylinder(6) is taken through a peristaltic pump(17) where it is mixed with air from an aerator(8) and sent to the electrochemical by actuating a solenoid valve(14). When the gas is not passed through the elec¬trochemical cell it is bypassed to an alkali trap(9) by deener-gising the solenoid(14). The solenoid vales are energised or deenergised by means of solid state relays(13) from the electron¬ic unit(10). The sensing electrodes are interfaced to part 11 and the generator electrodes are interfaced to part 12 in the electronic unit. The electronic unit is interfaced to a Personal Computer(16). Different sections of the electronic unit(10 shown in Figl) are :<br>
1*.  Milli volt signal conditioner (11) : - to measure the current from the sensing electrodes in  terms  of millivolts.<br>
2*.  Milli  Amp signal conditioner/generator (12)  :  - to generate and measure the current through generating electrodes.<br>
3*. Solid state relay interface: - to energise sole¬noids (14) to pass gas through the cell or to by pass gas through an alkali trap (9).<br>
4*.  Power  supply unit (15): - to provide power supply to various sections.<br>
PC system with interface card: A multifunction data acquisition card is used in an IBM compatible PC system to process the condi¬tioned signals in the measuring and generating electrodes and<br>
also to control the direction of flow of SO gas and to generate<br>
2<br>
appropriate current for electrolysis and finally to compute  and<br>
display the SO  concentration. 2<br>
The system uses a peristaltic pump (17) to pass known volume of gas through the cell containing improved electrolyte.<br>
The principle by which the analyser functions to detect and determine the presence of gases having reducing property present in a gas stream is explained below.<br>
When a sample containing reducing properties such as SO gas<br>
2<br>
is allowed to react with the electrolyte, it alters the concen¬tration of the constituents present in the electrolyte which in turn decreases the observed current between the electrodes. The difference in current is sensed by the sensing electrodes.<br>
To avoid the drawbacks of the existing electrolyte useful for the detection and determination of gases having reducing properties in the gas stream and reducing the downtime of such detection and determination a need has arisen to provide an improved electrolyte for the purpose.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful for the detection of gases having reducing properties present in process gas streams.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful for determining the presence of gases having reducing properties in process gas streams employing the coulometric technique which can eliminate the use of pyridine and avoid bad odour;<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful for detecting and determining the presence of gases having reducing properties in process gas streams employing the coulometric technique which can measure the concentration of such gases present in the gas stream in the presence of moisture;<br>
One other objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful for detecting and determining the presence of gases having reducing properties in process gas streams employing the coulometric technique which can eliminate down time in between measurements;<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful for detecting and determining the presence of gases having reducing properties in process gas streams employing the coulometric technique which can be used over an extended period without the need for changing the elec¬trolyte;<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved electrolyte useful in detecting and deter-<br>
mining the presence of gases having reducing properties in proc¬ess gas streams employing the coulometric technique which can be used for detecting and determining gases having reducing proper¬ties at all concentrations.<br>
With the above objectives in view, we have initiated re¬search work to develop , an improved electrolyte which can be used for the detection and determination of the presence of gases having reducing properties in process streams employing coulomet¬ric technique.<br>
Initialy we thought of using Iodine-Iodide combination as electrolyte. Accordingly experiments were conducted by passing known quantities of standard gases having reducing properties<br>
such as  SO gas through  (Iodine - Iodide system)  having good 2<br>
conductivity. The use of the Iodine - Iodide electrolyte for continuous determination of gases having reducing properties such<br>
as SO  at 10 %  level generate sulphuric acid build-up in the 2<br>
solution which lowers the pH of the medium. At low pH conditions, aerial oxidation of Iodide to Iodine takes place causing error in the detection and determination. Hence the medium requires a buffer to resist the acidity generated during each determinations. Some of the buffer systems which can be used are phosphoric acid, boric acid, phthalic acid and citric acid.<br>
The Iodine present in the electrolyte oxidises the gas having reducing properties and gets itself reduced to iodide ion. This reaction results in a reduction of a preset (sens¬ing) current generated between the sensing electrodes in the cell shown in fig 1 .The original (sensed) current, prior to passing of the gas stream containing gases having reducing properties such as S02 can be restored by electrolysis, which is effected by passing proportional current through the generating electrodes in the cell.<br>
The quantity of electricity (current * time) needed in the process of restoring to the original preset current, is a direct measure of the presence and the concentration of gas having reducing properties such as S02 that reduced the Iodine.<br>
The reaction in the cell can be explained by the chemical equation given below.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
A buffered solution is necessary to resist the change in pH due to the generation of sulphuric acid in the reaction, when a gas with reducing property like S02 at 10% concentration level is measured continuously. The use of buffer solution also avoids frequent changing of the electrolyte solution.<br>
Accordingly the present invention accordingly provides an electrolyte composition useful for the detection and determination of gases, having reducing properties in gas streams which comprises potassium iodide in the range 3 to 6.0% by weight of the composition and a buffer/in the range of 9 to 40.0% by weight, and the balance being water.<br>
The composition obtained by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture but is a synergistic formulation having properties different than the aggregate properties of the individual components. No chemical reaction between the constituents of the said composition.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the present electrolyte comprises an aqueous solution consisting of<br>
Potassium Iodide	3.5% by weight of the composition<br>
Disodium hydrogen phosphate 10.5% by weight of the composition<br>
Citric acid	7%  by weight of the composition<br>
pH of the combination buffer  5 + 0.1%<br>
The electrolytes of the present invention were tested for the detection and determination of gases having reducing proper¬ty. It is observed that the above mentioned electrolyte (150mL)<br>
was  found to be useful for the determination of pure SO gas  (a<br>
2<br>
gas with reducing property) upto 300mL with a change of pH within 0.5 units from the initial pH of the electrolyte.<br>
The following experiments describe in detail the inven¬tion which are provided to illustrate the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Example 1 :<br>
An  aqueous  solution of the  electrolyte having the  following composition was prepared for laboratory trials for the determina-<br>
tion of SO gas concentration by using the components 2<br>
Potassium Iodide (KI)	3 % by wt<br>
Disodiumhydrogenphosphate	20% by wt<br>
pH of the solution	5.0<br>
The above electrolyte (150mL)	was filled into the anode<br>
compartment ( 4 )  and 50mL into the cathode compartment ( 5 ).   Ini-<br><br>
tially 150mA of current was passed through the generating elec¬trodes  in the anode compartment till  the  sensing electrodes<br>
measure a current of 6uA in the display unit.  Now the  cell  is<br>
ready (Starting Mode) for the detection and determination of  SO<br>
2<br>
gas with reducing properties contained in a gas cylinder having 99.99% purity.<br>
The SO gas cylinder was connected to the peristaltic pump(f)M<br>
2	'<br>
with a pumping speed set to 1.25mL/min. The gas coming out of the peristaltic pump was mixed with air from the aerator(8) and was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemi¬cal cell for 60 seconds by energising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. The air was mixed only to carry the gas coming out of the peristaltic pump to the cell. After passing the gas for 60 seconds through the cell, the gas was bypassed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dissolved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 60 seconds, a decrease in sensing current was observed in the display unit, ie the sensing current decreases from 6 uA to a lower value. This indicates the presence of reducing gas in the gas (in this case S02) being passed. A DC current(150mA ie ri' Amps) was passed through the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('t' seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concentration of the reducing gas present in the gas being sam¬pled.<br>
From the guantity of electricity ('!' * 't' coulombs) passed through the generating  electrodes, the concentration of the<br>
reducing (SO ) gas was computed.<br><br>
5  trials were done for the determination of SO  gas in the<br>
2<br>
sample  and each time restoring the cell to Starting mode  before the passage of next sample.<br>
The results are tabulated in Table 1. Column 1 in the table represent the time (in Hours &amp; Minutes) and column  2  represent<br>
the concentration in mL.  Since the SO gas(99.99%  purity)  was<br>
2<br>
passed from a standard cylinder for 60 seconds  and the peristal¬tic pump being set to a flow rate of  1.25mL/min the expected computed concentration was to be around 1.25mL or 99.99%. Table 1:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is evident from the table 1  that<br>
1)	The repeatability of the value of SO concentration indicate<br>
the precision of measurement;<br>
2)	and there is no down time between measurements.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Aqueous solution of the  electrolyte having the following compo¬sition was prepared for the laboratory trials for the  determina¬tion of SO concentration. <br>

with a pumping speed set to 2.50mL/min. The gas coming out of the peristaltic pump was mixed with air from an aerator(8) and was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemi¬cal cell for 60 seconds by energising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. The air was mixed only to carry the gas coming out of the peristaltic pump to the cell.

indicates the presence of reducing gas SO present in the gas be-<br>
ing passed.  A DC current(150mA ie 'i' Amps) was passed through<br>
the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('t' seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concen¬tration of the reducing gas that was sampled.<br>
From the guantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>
through the generating electrodes, the concentration of the  SO<br>
2<br>
gas was computed.<br>
5  trials were done for the determination of SO gas in the<br>
sample and restoring the cell to Starting mode before the passage of next sample.<br>
The results are tabulated in Table 2. The column 1  in the table represent the time (in Hours &amp; Minutes) and the column  2<br>

This is the detection of the presence of reducing gas being passed. A DC current(150mA ie 'i' Amps) was passed through the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('f seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concentration of the reducing gas present in the gas passed.<br>
From the guantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>
through the generating electrodes, the concentration of the  SO2<br>
gas was computed.<br>
5 trials were done for the determination of SO2 gas in the<br>

Potassium Iodide (KI)        3 % by wt<br>
Disodiumhydrogenphosphate    20% by wt<br>
pH of the solution	5.0<br>
was used  for the determination of SO gas  concentration  in  a<br>
sulphuric acid plant.<br>
The process SO gas stream in moisture from stage I of the<br>
vanadiumpentoxide bed was connected to the peristaltic pump with a pumping speed set to 10. OOmL/min. The gas coining out of the peristaltic pump was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemical cell for 5 minutes by energising the solenoid<br>
valve(14) from the electronic unit. After passing the gas for 5 minutes through the cell, the gas was by passed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dissolved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 5 minutes, a decrease in sensing current was observed in the display unit. ie the sensing current will decrease from 6uA to a lower value.

The process gas samples were also analysed after fixing it in Sodiumhydroxide solution followed by lodimetric method(ie volumetric) and were found to be of the order of 9.1 ± 0.2%. The results obtained were comparable to that obtained by the instrumental method.<br>

gas with reducing properties contained in a gas cylinder having 99.99% purity.<br>
The process SO gas stream in moisture from stage II of the <br>
vanadiumpentoxide bed was connected to the peristaltic pump with a pumping speed set to 10.OOmL/min. The gas coining out of the peristaltic pump was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemical cell for 5 minutes by energising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. After passing the gas for 5 minutes through the cell, the gas was by passed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dissolved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 5 minutes, a decrease in sensing current was observed in the display unit. ie the sensing current decreases from 6uA to a lower value. This is the detection of the presence of reducing gas being passed. A DC current(150mA ie 'i' Amps) was passed through the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('f seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concentration of the reducing gas that was sampled.<br>
From the quantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>
through the generating electrodes, the concentration of the SO<br>
gas was computed.<br>
5 trials were done for the determination of SO gas in the<br>
sample and each time restoring the cell to Starting mode before<br>
the passage of next sample. The process gas samples were also analysed after fixing it in Sodiumhydroxide solution followed by lodimetric method(ie volumetric) and were found to be of the order of 6.00 ± 0.15%.<br>

Example 6<br>
The electrolyte described in the experiment, consisting of<br>
Potassium Iodide (KI)        4 % by wt<br>
Citric acid	10% by wt<br>
Disodiumhydrogenphosphate     20% by wt<br>
pH of the solution	5.0<br>
was tested in a sulphuric acid plant.<br>
The electrolyte(150mL) was filled into the anode compart¬ment (4) and 50mL into the cathode compartment(5). Initially 150mA of current was passed through the generating electrolytes in the anode compartment till the sensing electrodes measure a current of 6uA in the display unit. Now the cell is ready<br>
(Starting Mode) for the detection and determination of  SO  gas<br>
2<br>
with reducing properties contained in a gas cylinder having 99.99% purity.<br>
The stack gas in the sulphuric acid plant was connected to the peristaltic pump with a pumping speed set to lOOmL/min. The gas coming out of the peristaltic pump was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemical cell for 20 minutes by energising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. After passing the gas for 20 minutes through the cell, the gas was by passed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dissolved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 20 minutes, a decrease in sensing current was observed in the display unit. ie the sensing current decrease from 6uA to a lower value. This is the detection of the presence of reducing gas being passed. A DC current(150mA ie 'i' Amps) was passed through the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('t' seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concentration of the reducing gas that was sampled.<br><br>
From the quantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>
through the generating electrodes, the concentration of the SO<br>
gas was computed.<br>
5 trials were done for the determination of SO gas in the<br>
sample and each time restoring the cell to Starting mode before the passage of next sample. The process gas samples were also analysed after fixing it in Sodiumhydroxide solution followed by lodimetric method(ie volumetric) and were found to be of the order of 0.031 + 0.002%.<br>
The results  are tabulated in Table 6. The column 1  in the table represent the time (in Hours &amp; Minutes) and the column  2 represent the concentration in %. Table 6:<br>

It is inferred from the table 6 that<br>
1)	The repeatability of the experiments indicate the precision of<br>
measurement;<br>
2)	The electrolyte could be used for detect and determine the<br>
gas concentration in the presence of moisture; and<br>

Disodlumhydrogenphosphate    20% by wt<br>
pH of the solution	5.0<br>
was used for the detection of H S gas concentration near a  swew-<br>
age pumping station near Madras.<br>
The above electrolyte(150mL) was filled into the anode compartment(4) and 50mL into the cathode compartment(5). Initial¬ly 150mA of current was passed through the generating elec¬trodes in the anode compartment till the sensing electrodes measure a current of 6uA in the display unit. Now the cell is<br>

From the quantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>

gas was computed.<br>
5 trials were done for the determination of SO gas in the<br>
sample and each time restoring the cell to Starting mode before the passage of next sample. The process gas samples were also analysed after fixing it in 1% Zinc acetate solution followed by lodimetric method(ie volumetric) and were found to be of the order of 1.52 ± 0.02%.<br>
The results are tabulated in Table 7. The column 1  in the table  represent the time (in Hours &amp; Minutes) and the column  2 represent the concentration in %. Table 7:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is inferred from the table 7  that<br>
1)	The repeatability of the experiment indicate the precision<br>
of measurement;<br>
2)	The electrolyte could be used for detect and determine the H S<br>
gas concentration in the presence of moisture; and<br>

Example 8:<br>
In the laboratory a comparison study was made for the deter¬mination of SO gas with the use of electrolyte based on pyri-<br>
dine, iodine and dry methanol (a commercial product costing $800 per litre). 150 ml of the electrolyte based on pyridine, iodine and dry methanol(imported sample) was used in the anode compart¬ment of the cell and 50 ml electrolyte based on phosphoric acid(imported) was used in the cathode compartment. Initially 150mA of current was passed through the generating electrodes in the anode compartment till the sensing electrodes measure a current of 6uA in the display unit. Now the cell is ready<br>
(Starting Mode) for the detection and determination of  SO  gas<br>
with reducing properties contained in a gas cylinder having 99.99% purity.<br>
The  standard  SO  gas (99.99% purity) from a  cylinder was<br>
connected to the peristaltic pump with a pumping speed set to 1.25mL/min. The gas coming out of the peristaltic pump was mixed with air from an aerator(S) and was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemical cell for 60 seconds by ener¬gising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. The air was mixed only to carry the gas coming out of the peristaltic<br>
pump to the cell. After passing the gas for 60 seconds through the cell, the gas was by passed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dis¬solved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 60 seconds, a decrease in sensing current was observed in the display unit. ie the sensing current decreases from 6uA to a lower value. This is the detection of the presence of reducing gas being passed. A DC current(150mA ie 'i' Amps) was passed through the generating electrodes for a particular duration ('t' seconds) till the original sensing current of 6uA was restored. The time taken to restore the sensing current is a measure of the concentration of the reducing gas that was sampled.<br>
From the quantity of electricity ('i' * 't' coulombs) passed<br>
through the generating electrodes, the concentration of the SO<br>
gas was computed.<br>
5  trials were done for the determination of SO gas in the<br>
sample and each time restoring the cell to Starting mode before the passage of next sample.<br>
The results are tabulated in Table 7. The column 1 in the table represent the time (in Hours &amp; Minutes) and the column 2<br>
represent the concentration in mL.  Since the  SO  gas(99.99%<br>
purity) was passed from a standard cylinder for 60 seconds and the peristaltic pump being set to a flow rate of 1.25mL/min the expected computed concentration was to be around 1.25mL or 99.99%.<br>
Table 8:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is  evident from the table 8 that the repeatability of the<br>
value of SO concentration indicate the precision of measurement <br>
using pyridine based system.  However the main draw back was that it required a minimum of 30 minutes of wait time between deter-minations . Example 9:<br>
A field study was conducted in a sulphuric acid plant with the use of electrolyte based on pyridine, iodine and dry methanol (a commercial product costing $800 per litre) for the detection<br>
and determination of SO gas.  150 ml of the electrolyte based on<br>
pyridine, iodine and dry methanol(imported sample) was used in the anode compartment of the cell and 50 ml electrolyte based on phosphoric acid(imported) was used in the cathode compartment. Initially 150mA of current was passed through the generating electrodes in the anode compartment till the sensing electrodes measure a current of 6uA in the display unit. Now the cell is ready (Starting Mode) for the detection and determination of SO<br>
gas with reducing properties contained in a gas cylinder having 99.99% purity.<br>
The process SO gas stream in moisture from stage I of the<br>
vanadiumpentoxide bed was connected to the peristaltic pump with a pumping speed set to 10.OOmL/min. The gas coming out of the peristaltic pump was allowed to pass to the anode compartment of the electrochemical cell for 5 minutes by energising the solenoid valve(14) from the electronic unit. After passing the gas for 5 minutes through the cell, the gas was by passed by de-energising the solenoid valve to pass into an alkali trap(9) where the gas gets dissolved.<br>
While the gas was passed through the cell for 5 minutes, due to the presence of moisture in the gas stream, erratic change in the sensing current was observed and the electrolyte ultimately<br>
failed to respond to the detection of the SO gas even though the<br>
experiment was  repeated several times.  Hence it was  inferred<br>
that when this solution was tested for the determination of  SO<br>
in the sulphuric  acid plant, the solution failed due to the presence of moisture in the gas sample.  This electrolyte based on pyridine is sensitive to moisture and hence it is not suitable for industry environment. Advantages of the present invention.<br>
1)	The repeatability of the experiments indicates the precision<br>
of measurement;<br>
2)	The electrolyte  could even detect and determine the presence<br>
of reducing gases in the presence of moisture;<br><br>
3)	There is no down time in between measurements<br>
4)	Useful for on-line measurement even  in the industrial  envi-<br>
ronment.<br>
It is not sensitive to moisture and therefore also be used  for<br>
detecting and monitoring with industrial process.<br>
The major drawback in the pyridine based electrolyte is that  it<br>
is sensitive to moisture and it is based on non aqueous  solvent.<br>
Hence it is not suitable in the industrial process gas monitoring<br>
in the presence of moisture.<br><br><br>
1.	An electrolyte composition useful for the detection and determination of gases,<br>
having reducing properties in gas streams which comprises potassium iodide in<br>
the range 3 to 6.0% by weight of the composition and a buffer/in the range of 9<br>
to 40.0% by weight, and the balance being water.<br>
2.	An electrolyte composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the buffer used is<br>
selected from Phosphoric Acid, Boric Acid, Citric Acid, Succinic Acid, Di Sodium<br>
Hydrogen Phosphate, Mono Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate or mixtures thereof.<br>
3.	An electrolyte composition claimed in claims 1 to 2 wherein the amount of<br>
potassium iodide is 3% by weight, buffer 20% by weight and the pH of the<br>
electrolyte being 4.5 to 5.1.<br>

having reducing properties present in process gas streams substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
