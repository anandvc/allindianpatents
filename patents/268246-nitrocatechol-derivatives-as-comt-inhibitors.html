				<td>NITROCATECHO'L DERIVATIVES AS COMT INHIBITORS<br>
This invention relates to novel substituted nitrocatechols, their use in the treatment of some central and peripheral nervous system disorders and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Despite being used in clinical practice for several decades, levodopa (L-DOPA) continues to be the gold standard drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. This has helped to maintain keen interest in the development of inhibitors of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) based on the hypothesis that inhibition of this enzyme may provide clinical improvements in patients afflicted by Parkinson's disease undergoing treatment with L-DOPA and a peripheral amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. The rationale for the use of COMT inhibitors as adjuncts to L-DOPA/AADC therapy is based on their ability to reduce metabolic 0-methylation of L-DOPA to 3-0-methyl-L-DOPA (3-OMD), The duration of L-DOPA induced clinical improvement is brief as a result of the short hi vivo half-life of L-DOPA which contrasts with the long half-life of 3-OMD. Additionally, 3-OMD competes with L-DOPA for transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which means that only a very limited amount of an orally administered dose of L-DOPA actually reaches the site of action, i.e. the brain. Commonly, within only a few years of starting L-DOPA therapy with the usual dosage regime, L-DOPA induced clinical improvement declines at the end of each dose cycle, giving rise to the so-called 'wearing-off pattern of motor fluctuations. A close relationship between the 'wearing-off phenomenon and accumulation of 3-OMD has been described (Tohgi, H., et al., Neurosci. Letters, 132:19-22, 1992). It has been speculated that this may result from impaired brain penetration of L-DOPA due to competition for the transport system across the BBB with 3-OMD (Reches, A. et al., Neurology, 32:887-888, 1982) or more simply that there is less L-DOPA available to reach the brain (Nutt, J.G., Fellman, J.H., Clin. Neuropharmacol., 7:35-49, 1984). In effect, COMT inhibition protects L-DOPA from metabolic breakdown in the periphery through 0-methylation, such that with repeated doses of L-DOPA, the mean plasma L-DOPA concentration is raised. In addition to reduced competition for transport into the brain, a significantly greater percentage of the orally administered dose of L-DOPA is able to reach the site of action. Thus COMT inhibition serves to increase the bioavailability of<br>
L-DOPA and the duration of antiparkinsonian action is prolonged with single doses of L-DOPA (Nutt, J.G., Lancet, 351:1221-1222,1998).<br>
The most potent COMT inhibitors thusfar reported are 3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone (Tolcapone, Australian pat. AU-B-69764/87), (E)-2-cyano-N,N-diethyl-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide (Entacapone, German pat DE 3740383 Al) and BIA 3-202 (American pat. US 6512136) which all have inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range. Although sharing essentially the same phannacophore, tolcapone differs from entacapone and BIA 3-202 in that it easily enters the central nervous systems (CNS) and is able to inhibit cerebral COMT as well as peripheral COMT. It could be speculated that central inhibition may be less important if the more significant action of inhibiting COMT is to prevent breakdown of L-DOPA in the periphery. Indeed, the use of COMT inhibitors which do not penetrate into the brain at clinically relevant doses may avoid potential undesired CNS side-effects of these agents.<br>
Another serious issue which has emerged since these COMT inhibitors were introduced into clinical practice relates to the potential of these nitrocatechol-based xenobiotics to cause severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity). Indeed, shortly after its launch, tolcapone was withdrawn from the market after several cases of hepatotoxicity were reported including three unfortunate deaths from fatal fulminant hepatitis. Today tolcapone can only be used in Parkinsonian patients who are unresponsive to other treatments and strictly only with regular monitoring of liver function, which is expensive and inconvenient for the patient. Although the actual mechanistic causes of the liver toxicity associated with tolcapone are not fully understood, in vitro studies have shown that tolcapone may be reduced metabolically to reactive intermediates and it has been speculated that these may form covalent adducts with hepatic proteins resulting in hepatocellular injury (Smith, K.S. et al, Chem. Res. Toxicol., 16:123-128,2003).<br>
Entacapone on the other hand, although sharing the same nitrocatechol phannacophore with tolcapone, is not associated with liver toxicity and is generally regarded as a safe drug. Unfortunately however, entacapone is a significantly less potent COMT inhibitor than tolcapone and has a much shorter in-vivo half-life. This means that entacapone has a very limited duration of effect and as a consequence, the drug must be administered in very high doses with every dose of L-DOPA taken by the patient As such, the clinical<br>
efficacy of entacapone has been questioned - indeed a recent study (Parashos, S A. et al., Clin. Neuropharraacol., 27(3): 119-123, 2004) revealed that the principal reason for discontinuation of entacapone treatment in Parkinson's disease patients was a perceived lack of efficacy.<br>
In summary, there still remains a clear clinical requirement for a safe and effective COMT inhibitor for adjunctive therapy in the management of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Preferably, the COMT inhibitor should be endowed with greater potency and duration of COMT inhibition than entacapone, which would lead to greater clinical efficacy. More preferably, the COMT inhibitor should, unlike tolcapone, have limited access to the CNS, i,e. it should preferentially inhibit peripheral COMT rather than central COMT. Even more preferably, the COMT inhibitor should combine the aforementioned features and in addition should not be endowed with potential to cause liver toxicity as seen with tolcapone.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that certain nitrocatechols are very potent COMT inhibitors which are also devoid of, or have greatly reduced, toxicity risk. Furthermore, it has been unexpectedly ascertained that it is the chemical functionality of the non-catecholic substituent connected to the heterocyclic ring that determines the lack of toxic effects of the compounds.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
To date, there has been only one reported example of a nitrocatecholic [l,2,4]-oxadiazole in the prior art (Example 75 of Australian pat. AU-B-69764/87), this being 5-(3-methyl-l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-3-nitropyrocatechoI 1, which has the chemical structure shown below;<br>
This substance is a 3,5-disubstituted-[ 1,2,4]-oxadiazole with the methyl group occupying position C-3 of the heterocyclic oxadiazolyl ring and the nitrocatecholic pharmacophore attached to C-5.<br>
We have studied the oxadiazolyl compound 1 mentioned above and found it to be moderately active in the COMT inhibition assay (59% of control, see experimental section). Unfortunately however, compound 1 presents a significant toxicity risk (55% cell viability, see experimental section). As such, this particular compound 1 cannot be considered to represent an adequate solution to the present problem of a providing a potent and clinically safe COMT inhibitor.<br>
We have surprisingly found mat if the central ring is substituted with a pyridyl ring in oxidised form (i.e. pyridine N-oxide), that the resulting pyridine N-oxide compounds exhibit greatly reduced toxicity, or are even devoid of toxicity risk, whilst it is still concomittantly possible to maintain COMT inhibition superior to entacapone. If the position of the nitrocatechol pharmacophore is 'switched' from C-5 to the C-3 position of the oxadiazole ring, then the resulting compounds are usually less active in terms of COMT inhibition. The regioisomeric 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, wherein the nitrocatechol pharmacophore is attached to C-2 of the oxadiazolyl central ring are also usually less active hi terms of COMT inhibition. For example, consider the regioisomers 2 and 3 of the prior art oxadiazole 1 which we have also synthesised and evaluated in vivo;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Although both 2 and 3 each present a reduced toxicity risk in relation to 1, in terms of COMT inhibition compound 2 displayed only 79% of control and compound 3 was only marginally better at 64%. Thus it can be concluded that it is the combination of the correct positional arrangement of the heteroatoms in the central oxadiazole ring and the incorporation of the pyridine N-oxide functionality is unexpectedly crucial for obtaining<br>
synergy between high COMT inhibitory activity and safety for this type of COMT-inhibitor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to nitrocatecholic COMT inhibitors which are devoid of, or have greatly reduced, toxicity risk. Furthermore, it has been unexpectedly ascertained that it is the introduction of a nitrogen-based heterocyclic group in N-oxidised form, such as, for example, a pyridine N-oxide, that determines the lack of toxic effects of the nitrocatecholic compounds. We have further surprisingly found that compounds of general formula I are COMT inhibitors which are endowed with balanced properties of bioactivity, bioavailability and, in particular, safety:<br>

Materials and Methods<br>
Assay of mouse COMTactivity<br>
Liver samples from 60 days old NMRI mice weighing 20-30 g (Harlan-Interfauna Iberica, Barcelona, Spain) kept ten per cage under controlled environmental conditions (12 h light/dark cycle and room temperature 24 °C), were used in all experiments. Saline perfused tissues, obtained from pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg) anaesthetised mice, were used in the experiments. Tissues were immediately removed and homogenised in 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7,8 and stored at -80 °C.<br>
COMT activity was evaluated by the ability to methylate adrenaline to metanephrine, as previously described (Vieira-Coelho, M.A., Soares-da-Silva, P., Brain Res, 1999, 821, 69-78). Aliquots of 0.5 ml of liver homogenates were preincubated for 20 min with 0.4 ml of phosphate buffer (5 mM); thereafter, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min with adrenaline (500 µM 0.1 ml) in the presence of a saturating concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the methyl donor (250 uM). The incubation medium also contained pargyline (100 uM), MgCk (100 uM) and EGTA (1 mM). The preincubation and incubation were carried out at 37 °C under conditions of light protection with continuous shaking and without oxygenation. At the end of the incubation period the tubes were transferred to ice and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 µl of 2 M perchloric acid. The samples were then centrifuged (200 x g, 4 rain, 4 °C), and 500 (4.1 aliquots of the supernatant, filtered on 0.22 µm pore size Spin-X filter tubes (Costar) were<br><br>
used for the assay of metanephrine by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.<br>
In experiments designed to evaluate the effects of test compounds upon liver COMT, test compounds (in 5% carboxymethylcellulose) were given by gastric tube to overnight fasted mice. Thereafter, at defined intervals, livers were removed and used to determine COMT activity as described above.<br>
Assay of rat COMT activity<br>
Livers from 60 day old male Wistar rats weighing 240-260 g (Harlan-Interfauna Iberica, Barcelona, Spain), kept two per cage under controlled environmental conditions (12 h light/dark cycle and room temperature 24 °C) were used in all experiments. After decapitation, the organs were immediately removed and homogenised in 5 mM phosphate buffer of pH 7.8. COMT activity was evaluated by the ability to methylate adrenaline to metanephrine. Aliquots of 0.5 ml of liver homogenates were preincubated for 20 min with 0.4 ml of phosphate buffer (5 mM); thereafter, the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 rain with epinephrine (1000 nM; 0.1 ml) in the presence of a saturating concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (500 uM), the methyl donor; the incubation medium contained also pargyline (100 uM), MgCl2 (100 uM) and EGTA (1 mM). The preincubation and incubation were carried out at 37 °C under conditions of light protection with continuous shaking and without oxygenation.<br>
hi experiments designed to evaluate the oral bioavailability of test substances, compounds were given by gastric tube to overnight fasted rats. Thereafter, at defined intervals, animals were killed by decapitation and livers removed and used to determine COMT activity as described above. At the end of the incubation period (5 min) the tubes were transferred to ice and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 µl of 2 M perchloric acid. The samples were then centrifuged (200xg, 4 min, 4 °C), and 500 µl aliquots of the supernatant, filtered on 0.22 µm pore size Spin-X filter tubes (Costar) were used for the assay of metanephrine. The assay of metanephrine was carried out by means of high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The lower limits for detection of metanephrine ranged from 350 to 500 fhiol (0.5 to 1.0 pmol/mg protein/h).<br><br>
Levels of L-DOPA and 3-Q-methvl-L-DQPA in plasma<br>
Rats fasted overnight were administered orally with tolcapone, entacapone and compounds of general formula I (all at 3 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 4 ml/kg). One, 6 or 23 h later, rats were administered orally with L-DOPA (12 mg/kg) plus benserazide (3 mg/kg) or with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 4 ml/kg). One hour later rats were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg, i.p.), blood was collected through the vena cava and the whole brain was quickly removed. Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 g (4 °C) and the plasma samples were stored at -80 °C till the assay of L-DOPA and 3-0-methyl-L-DOPA. All animals interventions were performed in accordance with the European Directive number 86/609, and the rules of the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", 7th edition, 1996, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR), Washington, DC.<br>
Assay of L-DOPA and cateohol derivatives<br>
L-DOPA and 3-0-methyl-L-DOPA in blood samples were assayed by HPLC with electrochemical detection, as previously described (Soares-da-Silva et al., Brain Res. 2000;863:293-297). In brief, aliquots of 20 ul were injected into the chromatograph. The chromatographic system consisted of a pump (Gilson 307) and a stainless steel 5 \im ODS2 column (Biophase; Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) of 25 cm length and 4.6 mm diameter; samples were injected by means of an automatic sample injector (Gilson 231) connected to a Gilson dilutor (Gilson 401). The mobile phase was a degassed solution of citric acid 0.1 mM; sodium octylsulphate 0.5 mM; sodium acetate 0.1 M; NaaEDTA 0.17 mM; dibutylamine 1 mM and methanol (10% v/v), adjusted to pH 3.5 with PCA 2 M and pumped at a rate of 1.0 ml min"1. The detection was carried out electrochemically with a glassy carbon electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an amperometric detector (Gilson 142); the detector cell was operated at 0.75 V. The current produced was monitored using the Gilson Unipoint HPLC software.<br><br>
Cell toxicity<br>
The method, which detects cell toxicity of a test substance, follows that described by Pedrosa and Soares-da-Silva (Br. J. Pharmacol., 137, 1 1305-1313, 2002). Briefly, Neuro 2A mouse neuroblastoma cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 200 uL per well of culture medium for cell attachment (CMA), under a COa/air (5%/95%) humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Controls of the test system prior to incubations consisted in a morphological control (light microscopy) of the cultured cells: attachment, spreading and density. Five days after seeding (24 h after cells become confluent), the test compounds were incubated for 24 h with cultured cells. Cultures with no test article or ethanol were run in parallel as negative and positive controls. All incubations contained the same percentage of solvent needed for the test compound.<br>
Cell viability was measured using calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The membrane permeant calcein-AM, a nonfluorescent dye, is taken up and converted by intracellular esterases to membrane impermeant calcein, which emits green fluorescence. After treatment with test article or vehicle for 24 h, cells are washed twice with Hanks' medium (medium composition, in mM: NaCI, 137; KC1, 5; MgSO^ 0.8; Na2HPO4, 0.33; KH2PO4, 0.44; CaCl2, 0.25; MgCl2,1.0; Tris HC1, 0.15 and sodium butyrate, 1.0, pH=7.4) and loaded with 2 uM calcein-AM in Hanks' medium, at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence is measured at 485 nm excitation and 530 run emission wavelengths in a multiplate reader. To determine minimum staining for calcein-AM (calceinmin), eight wells were treated with ethanol 30 min before calcein-AM addition. The percent viability is then calculated as [(calcein8ampie - calceinmin) / (calceinconiroi - calceinrain)] x 100.<br>

Compounds of general formula I were also found to be potent inhibitors of rat liver COMT, the maximal inhibitory effect being achieved within 1 h to 3 h after their oral administration (Table 2). The maximal inhibitory effect of entacapone (Ent) and tolcapone (Tolc) were observed within 1 h after administration (Table 2). Nine hours after administration, entacapone is devoid of COMT inhibitory effects and tolcapone produces minimal inhibitory effects (~ 16% inhibition), whereas compounds of general formula I continue to inhibit COMT activity by 22% to 90% of control levels (Table 2).<br><br>

Conclusion<br>
Compounds of general formula I are very potent catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors with significantly reduced toxicity. Compounds of general formula I have potentially valuable pharmaceutical properties in the treatment of some central and peripheral nervous system disorders where inhibition of 0-methylation of catecholamines may be of therapeutical benefit, such as mood disorders, Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian disorders, restless legs syndrome, gastrointestinal disturbances, edema formation states and hypertension. The possibility to use a potent, long-acting inhibitor with improved safety profile opens new perspectives in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances, edema formation states, and hypertension by improving the safety of nitrocatecholic COMT inhibitors whilst<br>
improvhig or maintaining duration and selectivity of COMT inhibition. This is particularly important when thinking of treating patients afflicted by Parkinson's disease who are taking L-DOPA plus a peripheral AADC inhibitor due to the fact that this is long-term treatment.<br>
