				<td>ION EXCHANGE CARTRIDGE FOR FUEL CELL APPLICATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell system and, more particularly,<br>
to an ion exchange cartridge for the fuel cell system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally<br>
responsible energy source for electric vehicles and various other applications. In<br>
particular, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for the<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles.<br>
[0003] One type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel<br>
cell. The PEM fuel cell typically includes three basic components: a cathode, an<br>
anode, and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and the anode typically<br>
include a finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon particles<br>
and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between<br>
the cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrolyte-assembly (MEA).<br>
The MEA is often disposed between porous diffusion media (DM) which facilitate<br>
a delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen, for an<br>
electrochemical fuel cell reaction. Individual fuel cells can be stacked together in<br>
series to form a fuel cell stack. The fuel cell stack is capable of supplying a<br>
quantity of electricity sufficient to provide power to a vehicle.<br>
[0004] During operation of the fuel cell stack, the fuel cell stack temperature is<br>
generally maintained within a desired range for the electrochemical fuel cell<br>
reaction. A coolant system having a coolant tank and coolant lines in fluid<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack is typically employed for this purpose.<br>
Coolant, such as substantially pure water, from a coolant tank is supplied to the<br>
fuel cell stack for regulating the temperature thereof. The coolant supplied to the<br>
fuel cell stack is typically desired to have a minimal electrical conductivity. If ions<br>
are present in the coolant, an electrical conductivity of the coolant increases and<br>
a power generation efficiency of the fuel cell stack decreases. To militate against<br>
 <br>
the decrease in the fuel cell stack efficiency, an ion-exchange cartridge for<br>
removing ions in the coolant is typically employed in the coolant system.<br>
[0005] Known ion exchange cartridges are disposed in-line between the coolant<br>
tank and the fuel cell stack. After sufficient usage, the exhausted ion exchange<br>
cartridge including a housing, connectors, and resin, must be replaced and<br>
properly discarded. Such service on in-line ion exchange cartridges is generally<br>
difficult. For example, access to the part of the engine compartment where the<br>
ion-exchange cartridge is disposed may be limited. Additionally, the line is<br>
necessarily opened to replace the in-line ion exchange cartridge, resulting in a<br>
draining of at least some of the coolant. An entry of contaminants from the<br>
environment into the coolant system during such service is therefore likely. A<br>
subsequent and undesirable clean-up of the coolant system following service is<br>
generally also required.<br>
[0006] There is a continuing need for an ion exchange cartridge and method for<br>
servicing a coolant system having the ion-exchange cartridge that employs<br>
reusable parts, minimizes waste, minimizes a loss of the coolant during the<br>
service, and minimizes the exposure of the coolant system to contamination from<br>
the environment. Desirably, the ion-exchange cartridge also has an integrated<br>
housing with closing and sealing functions that facilitates a reusing and a refilling<br>
of the ion-exchange cartridge with service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In concordance with the instant disclosure, an ion exchange cartridge and<br>
method for servicing a coolant system having the ion-exchange cartridge that<br>
employs reusable parts, minimizes waste, minimizes a loss of the coolant during<br>
the service, minimizes the exposure of the coolant system to contamination from<br>
the environment, and has an integrated housing with closing and sealing<br>
functions that facilitates a reusing and a refilling of the ion-exchange cartridge<br>
with service, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, an ion exchange cartridge for a coolant system of a<br>
fuel cell stack includes a housing adapted to contain an ion exchange resin<br>
 <br>
therein. The housing has an inlet and at least one fluid-permeable outlet window<br>
configured for coolant to flow therethrough. The ion exchange cartridge is<br>
adapted to be removably disposed in the coolant system.<br>
[0009] In a further embodiment, an ion exchange cartridge assembly for a coolant<br>
system of a fuel cell stack includes the ion exchange cartridge having the<br>
housing with the ion exchange resin disposed. The ion exchange cartridge<br>
assembly includes a bracket coupled to the ion exchange cartridge. The bracket<br>
is adapted for removal of the ion exchange cartridge from the coolant system.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, a coolant tank assembly (CTA) of a coolant<br>
system for a fuel cell stack includes a coolant tank having a coolant inlet and a<br>
coolant outlet. The coolant tank having an aperture formed therein. The CTA<br>
includes the ion exchange cartridge assembly removably disposed in the coolant<br>
tank and in fluid communication with the coolant inlet.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0022] FIG. 1 shows a coolant system having a coolant tank assembly 2 (CTA)<br>
according to the present disclosure. The CTA 2 includes a coolant tank 4 having<br>
a coolant inlet 6 and a coolant outlet 8. The coolant inlet 6 and the coolant outlet<br>
8 are in fluid communication with a fuel cell stack (not shown), for example, via a<br>
coolant circuit. The coolant tank 4 is adapted to receive coolant that has been<br>
circulated through the fuel cell stack and store the coolant prior to a recirculation<br>
thereof. The coolant tank 4 shown is a multi-chambered coolant reservoir. A<br>
skilled artisan should appreciate that other configurations of the coolant tank 4,<br>
for example, a single chambered coolant tank 4, may be employed as desired. A<br>
plurality of coolant inlets 6, disposed at either end of the coolant tank 4, and a<br>
plurality of coolant outlets 8, typically disposed at a bottom end of the coolant<br>
tank 4, may also be employed.<br>
[0023] The coolant tank 4 has an aperture 10 formed therein. An ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12 is inserted through the aperture 10 and seated at a bottom<br>
 <br>
14 of the coolant tank 4 adjacent the coolant inlet 6. The ion exchange cartridge<br>
assembly 12 is in fluid communication with the coolant inlet 6 and adapted for<br>
coolant to flow therethrough. The coolant flows through the ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12 for removal of undesirable ions from the coolant prior to<br>
the coolant entering the coolant tank 4, and subsequently the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0024] With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the ion exchange cartridge assembly 12<br>
includes an ion exchange cartridge 16 with a housing 18. The housing 18 is<br>
adapted for an ion exchange resin to be disposed therein. The ion exchange<br>
resin may be a substantially water-insoluble material provided in the form of<br>
beads, for example. In one embodiment, the ion exchange resin is fabricated<br>
from an organic polymer substrate. As nonlimiting examples, the ion exchange<br>
resin may include at least one of a strongly acidic polymer, for example, having<br>
sulfonic acid groups, a strongly basic polymer, for example, having<br>
trimethylammonium groups, a weakly acidic polymer, for example, having<br>
carboxylic acid groups, and a weakly basic polymer, for example, having amino<br>
groups. As further nonlimiting examples, the ion exchange resin may include at<br>
least one of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (polyAMPS), poly(acrylamido-N-<br>
propyltrimethylammonium chloride) (polyAPTAC), and polyethylene amine. A<br>
skilled artisan should appreciate that other suitable ion exchange resins may be<br>
used as desired.<br>
[0025] The ion exchange cartridge 16 has at least one fluid-permeable outlet<br>
window 20 formed in the housing 18. In a particular embodiment, the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 has a plurality of outlet windows 20 arranged around the<br>
housing 18. The outlet window 20 is configured for the coolant to flow<br>
therethrough from the coolant inlet 6, through the ion exchange resin, and into<br>
the coolant tank 4. A volume of the coolant flow through the ion exchange<br>
cartridge 16 may range from about 1 liter per minute to about 5 liters per minute,<br>
for example. In a particular embodiment, the volume of coolant flow through the<br>
ion exchange cartridge 16 is from about 2 liters per minute to about 4 liters per<br>
minute. A suitable coolant flow for the coolant system of the fuel cell stack may<br>
be selected as desired. A size of the ion exchange cartridge 16 may also be<br>
 <br>
appropriately selected to accommodate a desired flow rate and to minimize<br>
pressure drop across the ion exchange cartridge 16.<br>
[0026] The housing 18 of the ion exchange cartridge 16 has a first end 22 with a<br>
first opening 23 formed therein. The housing 18 has a second end 24 with an<br>
inlet 25 formed therein. The inlet 25 is adapted for fluid communication with the<br>
coolant inlet 6 of the coolant tank 4. The inlet 25 facilitates the flow of the coolant<br>
into the ion exchange cartridge 16 for removal of undesirable ions.<br>
[0027] The ion exchange cartridge 16 includes a closure head 26 removably<br>
coupled to the housing 14 and adapted to seal the first opening 23. The closure<br>
head 26 may have dimensions that allow the closure head 26 to be at least<br>
partially inserted into the first opening 23 of the housing 14.<br>
[0028] At least one of the housing inlet 25 and outlet window 20 may have a<br>
porous cover 27, such as a mesh, disposed thereover. Suitable porous covers<br>
27	may be selected as desired. For example, the porous cover 27 may be<br>
integrally molded with the housing 18. The porous cover 27 may be over-molded<br>
to the housing 18. In another embodiment, the porous cover 27 may be at least<br>
one of glued and welded, for example, to the housing 18 over the housing inlet<br>
25 and the outlet window 20. The porous cover 27 is adapted to keep the ion<br>
exchange resins within the housing 18 while the ion exchange cartridge 16 is<br>
disposed within the coolant tank 4, and particularly while the coolant flows<br>
therethrough.<br>
[0029] The housing 18 is adapted to be removably disposed in the coolant tank 4.<br>
For example, the housing 18 may be a substantially cylindrical barrel that is<br>
inserted through the aperture 10 of the coolant tank 4. In one embodiment, the<br>
ion exchange cartridge assembly 12 further includes a bracket 28 coupled to the<br>
ion exchange cartridge 16. For example, the bracket 28 may be adapted to be<br>
coupled with the closure head 26. The bracket 28 thereby enables a removal of<br>
the ion exchange cartridge 16 from the coolant tank 4 as desired. The bracket<br>
28	may also have a length that allows the ion exchange cartridge 16 to be seated<br>
at a base of the coolant tank 4 when installed in the CTA 2.<br>
 <br>
[0030] A cap 30 is coupled to the bracket 28 at an end of the bracket 28 opposite<br>
the ion exchange cartridge 16. The cap 30 may be at least one of snap-on and<br>
threaded as desired. Other suitable types of caps 30 may also be employed. In a<br>
particular embodiment, the aperture 10 of the coolant tank 4 may be<br>
circumscribed by an outwardly extending, threaded lip (not shown). The<br>
threaded lip of the coolant tank 4 may cooperate with the threaded cap 30 to seal<br>
the aperture 10 of the coolant tank 4 during an operation of the ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12. For example, the cap 30 may include a flat sealing O-ring<br>
(not shown) for sealing the aperture 10 of the coolant tank 4 into which the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 is inserted.<br>
[0031] The ion exchange cartridge assembly 12, and in particular the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16, may be cost-effectively produced, for example, by an<br>
injection molding process as is known in the art. Other suitable processes for<br>
producing and assembling the ion exchange cartridge assembly 12 and the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 may be employed as desired.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIGS. 2 to 8, various embodiments of the ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12 of the disclosure are described in further detail. The<br>
housing 18 of the ion exchange cartridge 16 is adapted to couple with the closure<br>
head 26. As a nonlimiting example, the first end 22 of the housing 18 has at<br>
least one female clip feature 32 that cooperates with at least one male clip<br>
feature 34 formed on the closure head 26. The female clip feature 32 may<br>
include, for example, an outwardly extending portion 36 having a clip opening 38<br>
formed therein for receiving the male clip feature 34. A skilled artisan should<br>
understand that the at least one female clip feature 32 may alternatively be<br>
formed on the closure head 26 and the at least one male clip feature may<br>
alternatively be formed on the housing 18, as desired.<br>
[0033] In a further embodiment, a first sealing member 40, such as a first O-ring,<br>
is disposed between the closure head 26 and the first opening 23 of the housing<br>
18. It should be appreciated that a skilled artisan may select other suitable<br>
sealing members for use as the first sealing member 40. The first sealing<br>
member 40 provides a sealing engagement between the closure head 26 and the<br>
 <br>
housing 18 when the closure head 26 and the housing are 18 assembled to form<br>
the ion exchange cartridge 16. The first sealing member 40 facilitates an<br>
opening of the ion exchange cartridge 16 when removed from the coolant tank 4<br>
for replacement of exhausted ion exchange resin.<br>
[0034] In a particular embodiment, the first sealing member 40 may be disposed<br>
in a first circumferential groove 42 formed in one of the housing 18 and the<br>
closure head 26. It should be appreciated that the first sealing member 40 may<br>
be disposed on a surface of the closure head 26 and sandwiched between the<br>
surface and an inner wall of the housing 18 when the ion exchange cartridge 16<br>
is assembled. A separating wall 43 of the closure head 26 and the first sealing<br>
member 40 of the closure head 26 militates against a flowing of the coolant<br>
through the first opening 23 of the housing 18. The wall 43 and the first sealing<br>
member 40 also militate against any expelling of the ion exchange resin from the<br>
housing 18 due to pressure from the coolant flow.<br>
[0035] The closure head 26 may also have at least one male bayonet fitting 44.<br>
The male bayonet fitting 44 is adapted to couple with a female bayonet fitting 46<br>
on the bracket 28. The male bayonet fitting 44 may include a channel 48 that<br>
cooperates and the female bayonet fitting 46. As a nonlimiting example, the<br>
male bayonet fitting 44 may include a plurality of outwardly extending clip<br>
features and the female bayonet fitting 46 may include a ring feature adapted to<br>
fit tightly over the clip features. One of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate<br>
that the male bayonet fitting 44 may alternatively be formed on the bracket 28<br>
and that the female bayonet fitting 46 may alternatively be formed on the closure<br>
head 26, if desired. Other suitable means for coupling the closure head 26 with<br>
the bracket 28 for removably disposing the ion exchange cartridge 16 within the<br>
coolant tank 4 may also be employed. For example, at least one of the closure<br>
head 26, the bracket 28, and the cap 30 may be integrally formed as a single<br>
part.<br>
[0036] In an additional embodiment, the second end 24 of the housing 18 has a<br>
second sealing member 50, such as a second O-ring. The second sealing<br>
member 50 may circumscribe the second end 24 of the housing 18. The second<br>
 <br>
sealing member 50 is adapted to sealingly seat within the coolant tank 4 in fluid<br>
communication with the coolant inlet 6. For example, the second sealing<br>
member 50 may be disposed between the housing 18 and a seating feature (not<br>
shown) formed in a base of the coolant tank 4 in line with the coolant inlet 6. The<br>
second sealing member 50 may thereby militate against the coolant flow<br>
bypassing the ion exchange cartridge 16 and directly entering the coolant tank 4.<br>
As with the first sealing member 40, the second sealing member 50 may be<br>
selected as desired. The second sealing member 50 may be disposed within a<br>
second circumferential groove 52 formed in the housing 18 at the second end 24<br>
thereof.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 9, a method of assembling the ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12 of the present disclosure is provided. The method<br>
includes first providing the housing 18 with the second sealing member 50, the<br>
closure head 26 with the first sealing member 40, and the bracket 28. The<br>
housing 18 is then filled with a suitable ion exchange resin. The closure head 26<br>
is coupled to the housing 18, for example, by inserting the closure head into the<br>
housing 14 until the male clip features 34 of the closure head 26 cooperate with<br>
the female clip features 32 of the housing 18 to militate against relative<br>
movement therebetween. Similarly, the method includes coupling the bracket 28<br>
with the closure head 26, for example, by inserting the male bayonet features 44<br>
of the closure head 26 into the female bayonet fitting 46 of the bracket 28 until<br>
the channels 48 of the male bayonet fitting 44 cooperate with the female bayonet<br>
fitting 46 to militate against relative movement therebetween. The ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 12 is thereby assembled and prepared for installation in the<br>
coolant tank 4.<br>
[0038] The ion exchange cartridge assembly 12 is installed in the coolant tank 4<br>
by inserting the ion exchange cartridge assembly 12 through the aperture 10.<br>
The second end 24 of the ion exchange cartridge 16 is sealingly seated at the<br>
base of the coolant tank 4 in fluid communication with the coolant inlet 6 of the<br>
coolant tank 4. The coolant tank 4 is then sealed with the cap 30, for example,<br>
by twisting the cap 30 if threaded. It should be appreciated that the bracket 28<br>
 <br>
does not turn with the twisting of the cap 30. Following a period of use, the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 may be removed form the coolant tank 4 by unsealing the<br>
cap 30 and pulling on the bracket 28 to unseat and remove the ion exchange<br>
cartridge 16. The ion exchange cartridge assembly 12 may then be partially or<br>
completely disassembled and the exhausted ion exchange cartridge 16<br>
recharged with new ion exchange resin. Alternatively, the exhausted ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 may be replaced with a recharged ion exchange cartridge<br>
16 having the new resin.<br>
[0039] A skilled artisan should appreciate that the ion exchange cartridge<br>
assembly 16 has an optimized and robust size. The CTA 2 and the ion<br>
exchange cartridge assembly 16 of the present disclosure facilitate an ease in<br>
service and replacement of exhausted ion exchange resin, for example, at a<br>
supplier refilling station. In particular, it is surprisingly found that the clips 32, 34<br>
and the bayonets 44, 46 of the present disclosure allow the ion exchange<br>
cartridge 16 to be removed and disassembled multiple times without employing<br>
specialized tooling to replace the ion exchange resin inside the ion exchange<br>
cartridge 16.<br>
[0040] Additionally, a loss of coolant upon service is minimized as the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 may simply be removed from the coolant tank 4 without<br>
breaking a coolant line, as is the practice with conventional, in-line ion exchange<br>
systems. Unlike conventional in-line systems, the ion exchange cartridge 16 may<br>
be recharged and recycled instead of being disposed of following removal.<br>
Similarly, exposure of the coolant to contamination, for example, through<br>
environmental contact is minimized with the CTA 2 and the ion exchange<br>
cartridge assembly 16 of the disclosure.<br>
[0041] The position of the at least one window 20 in the ion exchange cartridge<br>
16 may be selected so that the at least one window 20 is in substantially<br>
continuous contact with the coolant within the coolant tank 4. It should therefore<br>
be understood that a contact between the ion exchange resin inside the ion<br>
exchange cartridge 16 with the coolant fluid inside the coolant tank 4<br>
advantageously cleans the coolant regardless of whether the coolant is flowing<br>
 <br>
