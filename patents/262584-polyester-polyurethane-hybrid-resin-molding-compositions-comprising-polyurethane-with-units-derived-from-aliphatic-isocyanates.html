POLYESTER-POLYURETHANE HYBRID RESIN MOLDING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING<br>
POLYURETHANE WITH UMTS DERIVED FROM ALIPHATIC ISOCYANATES<br>
This invention relates to hybrid resins. In one aspect, the invention relates to<br>
hybrid resins comprising a polyester resin in combination with a polyurethane resin while<br>
in another aspect, the invention relates to hybrid resins in which the polyurethane<br>
comprises units derived from aliphatic isocyanates. In still another aspect, the invention<br>
relates to coatings made from such hybrid resins.<br>
Polyester-polyurethane hybrid resins are known in the art of thermoset molding<br>
compositions (e.g., USP 5,153,261). These resins are normally tougher than polyesters<br>
and stronger, suffer and less expensive than polyurethanes. Typical of such resins are<br>
those comprising a hydros-terminated unsaturated polyester polyol, an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (e.g., styrene) and a polyisocyanate. They are easily adapted to<br>
many common thermoset molding techniques presently employed in the polyurethane<br>
and unsaturated polyester industries. Xycon® hybrid resins available from Cook<br>
Composites and Polymers are representative of these resins.<br>
Hybrid resins are two component or part systems comprising an A part and a B<br>
part. The A part contains the polyisocyanate and a polyester catalyst, while the B part<br>
contains the hydroxy-terminated unsaturated polyester polyol/unsaturated monomer<br>
solution, optionally with a polyurethane catalyst and/or filler. Upon mixing parts A and<br>
B together under the appropriate conditions, an interpenetrating network of molecular<br>
chains is formed. The polyester component of the mix provides the chain extension<br>
function while the polyisocyanate component provides the crosslinking function. The<br>
result is a molded part or coating that demonstrates improved toughness and thermal<br>
properties over either component alone.<br>
Gel coats are typically used as the outer or external surface layer of composite<br>
molded article because they impart a smooth, durable appearance to the article.<br>
Unsaturated polyesters resins are widely used for marine and cultured marble gel coats<br>
because they are inexpensive, easy with which to work, and cure at room temperature.<br>
Moreover, these resins provide a strong, flexible, abrasion and impact resistant surface.<br>
However, these coating properties require improvement in certain stressful applications,<br>
such as windmill blades. These applications require a coating with superior moisture-<br>
resistance, toughness (e.g., resistance to cracking) and similar properties that will protect<br>
the underlying laminate from deterioration by environmental forces.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is a hybrid resin composition comprising:<br><br>
-2-<br>
A.	an A part composition comprising an aliphatic poryfunctional isocyanate<br>
compound and a free radical polymerization initiator; and<br>
B.	a B part composition comprising an ethylenically unsaturated, substantially<br>
water-free, polyester polyol and a polyurethane catalyst.<br>
The hybrid resin compositions comprise about 10 to 50 weight percent A part, about 50<br>
to 90 weight percent B part. The molar ratio of NCO groups to OH groups is between 0.3<br>
to 2.0, preferably between 0.5 to 1.5. The aliphatic polyfunctional isocyanate in A part<br>
has the NCO content of 5 to 50 percent, preferably 10 to 35 percent. The A part<br>
composition can contain a non-interfering solvent, e.g., styrene, and the B part<br>
composition typically has an acid value of 10 or less, preferably 5 or less (based on solids)<br>
and a hydroxy] number on solids of about 120-170, preferably 130 to 160. For outdoor<br>
use, the B part composition is preferably free of hydrogens on tertiary carbon, ether<br>
glycols and terephthalic acid residues.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a gel coat made from the hybrid resin and<br>
in still another embodiment, the invention is an article comprising a gel coat made from<br>
the hybrid resin.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated monomer used in the A part composition of the<br>
hybrid resin can be any ethylenically unsaturated monomer capable of crosslinking the<br>
unsaturated polyester polyol via vinyl addition polymerization. Examples of useful<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers are styrene, o-, m-, p-methyl styrene, methyl<br>
acrylate, methyl methacrylate, t-butylstyrene, divinyl benzene, diallyl phthalate, triallyl<br>
cyanurate and mixtures of two or more unsaturated monomers. The preferred monomer<br>
is styrene because it provides an economical monomer solution.<br>
The unsaturated polyester polyol has at least one dicarboxylic alkene moiety and is<br>
preferably an oligomer of an a.p-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid compound<br>
obtained by the condensation reaction of one or more of a saturated di- or polycarboxylic<br>
acid or anhydride and an unsaturated di- or polycarboxylic acid or anhydride with a<br>
glycol or a polyhydric alcohol. The unsaturated polyester polyol can also be prepared<br>
from unsaturated di- or polycarboxylic acid(s) or anhydride(s) with glycols and/or<br>
polyhydric alcohol(s). The polyols used in this invention have an acid number or value of<br>
less than five, and preferably Jess than about two. Further, the polyols used in this<br>
indention have equivalent weights of between about 250 and about 1000, and preferably<br>
between about 250 and about 500. Examples of suitable saturated di- or polycarboxylic<br>
acids include isophthalic, orthophthalic, terephthalic, adipic, succinic, sebacic acid and<br>
mixtures of two or more of these compouhds with isophthalic acid being, preferred.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Typical unsaturated carboxylic acids or anhydrides include maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
citraconic acid, chloromaleic acid, allyl succinic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, their<br>
anhydrides and mixtures of two or more such compounds, with maleic anhydride being<br>
the preferred choice. Examples of polyhydric alcohols which are useful in the invention<br>
include neopentyl glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, polyethylene glycols, glycerol, mannitol, 1,2-<br>
propanediol, pentaerythritol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,3-butylene glycol and mixtures of two or<br>
more of such compounds. For outdoor use, the B part composition is preferably free of<br>
tertiary hydrogens, ether glycols and terephthalic acid residues.<br>
The B part should be substantially water-free. "Substantially water-free" means<br>
that the water content of the B part is sufficiently low to avoid unacceptable levels of<br>
foaming. Preferably, the B part comprises no more than about 2000 ppm water,<br>
preferably no more than 1000 ppm water, based on the total weight of the B part.<br>
The aliphatic isocyanate compound, typically referred to as an aliphatic<br>
pohyisocyanate, must have at least two functional groups and be capable of reacting with<br>
the polyester polyol. Examples of suitable isocyanate compounds include 2,2,4-<br>
trimethyl-hexamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate and their biuret and cyclic trimer forms. Preferably, the aliphatic isocyanate<br>
compound is hexamethylene diisocyanate, more preferably the dimer or trimer form of<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate.<br>
In one embodiment, the aliphatic isocyanate compound may be modified with a<br>
polyol, such as a glycol, to provide a polymeric form for ease of handling. Typically, the<br>
isocyanate content ranges from about 5% to about 50%, more preferably from about 10%<br>
to about 35% based on the combined atomic weight of the isocyanate functional groups<br>
and the total molecular weight of the aliphatic isocyanate compound.<br>
The free radical polymerization catalysts useful in producing the hybrid resin<br>
compositions of this invention are vinyl polymerization catalysts such as peroxides,<br>
persulfides, perborates, percarbonates, and azo compounds or any other suitable catalyst<br>
capable of catalyzing the vinyl polymerization of the polyester polyol and/or the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Illustrative of a few such catalysts are benzoyl<br>
peroxide (BPO), tertiarybutyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB), 2,2'-azo-bis-isobutyronitrile,<br>
dibenzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxide carbonate<br>
and t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate. Promoters can also be used in combination with<br>
vinyl polymerization peroxide catalysts to control the rate of free radical initiation. A<br>
common benzoyl peroxide promoter is N,N-diethylaniline.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Catalysts that are useful in catalyzing the polyurethane formation in producing the<br>
hybrid resin in accordance with this invention include: (a) tertiary amines such as<br>
N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine; (b) tertiary phosphines such as trialkylphosphines; (c)<br>
strong bases such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkoxides, and<br>
phenoxides; (d) acidic metal salts of strong acids such as ferric chloride; and (e)<br>
organometallic compounds such as dibutyltin dilaurate, bismuth carboxylate, and<br>
zirconium chelate 2,4-pentanedione. Other commonly used catalysts for making<br>
polyurethanes can be found in USP 4,280,979.<br>
The hybrid resins of the invention can be prepared by a process based on liquid<br>
reactive molding or compression molding techniques commonly employed in the<br>
unsaturated polyester and polyurethane industries. Liquid molding is the direct injecting<br>
or pouring of a hybrid resin into a mold (closed molding) or onto a mold (open molding).<br>
In liquid injection closed molding, the polyisocyanate and hydroxy-terminated polyester<br>
in the monomer solution (polyol) are fed separately into the chamber of a mixing head<br>
where the two components are mixed. Upon mixing, the hybrid reaction begins<br>
instantaneously whereby the rate of reactivity is dependent on the catalyst used. The<br>
hybrid liquid stream is injected between mold halves wherein the reactions between the<br>
various components of the hybrid resin system continue. After sufficient time for cure,<br>
typical 1 to 120 minutes, preferably 2 to 60 minutes, the part is removed from the mold.<br>
The part can be used as molded or be further post-annealed in an oven. Common liquid<br>
closed molding techniques include resin transfer molding (RTM), reaction injection<br>
molding (RIM) and structural reaction injection molding (S-RIM).<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to obtain a curable resin composition,<br>
comprising at least one hybrid resin as defined according to the invention, which can be<br>
used for preparing, by curing, coatings like gels coats (or barrier coats) or composite<br>
molded articles. So, the resins of the invention can be used for either composite molded<br>
articles, based on SMC, BMC, DMC or for coatings like gel coats (or barrier coats).<br>
The said coatings may be applied to a composite molded substrate made from<br>
either a resin according to the invention or from other resins, including UPR or vinyl ester<br>
or any other thermosetting resin.<br>
Liquid injection open molding follows the same procedure except the hybrid resin<br>
is sprayed onto a mold where one side of the molded part is exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
This molding process is commonly termed "spray-up molding." Direct pour liquid<br>
molding comprises hand-mixing the polyol and polyisocyanate and then pouring the<br>
hybrid liquid into or onto a mold wherein curing occurs. The main differences between<br><br>
-5-<br>
injection and pouring are the mix time, mix intensity and injection pressure. In both<br>
liquid molding techniques, the polyol and/or polyisocyanate can contain fibrous<br>
materials, fillers and/or other additives but in gel coat applications, the resin is typically<br>
free of any fibrous materials and fillers.<br>
Hybrid resins are also amendable to compression molding. Common compression<br>
molding techniques include sheet, bulk or dough molding compounds, identified as SMC,<br>
BMC and DMC, respectively. Regardless of the molding technique employed, the hybrid<br>
resins of the invention have the advantages of improved shrinkage control, surface<br>
appearance and impact strength without significantly sacrificing thermal properties.<br>
The gel coats of this invention are thick relative to a coat of paint but typically still<br>
less than half of a millimeter in thickness. For a liquid layer of this thickness to stay in<br>
place on a mold surface that is not in a horizontal orientation, the resin should be<br>
thixotropic. In other words, the viscosity is relatively low during applications by such<br>
means as spraying, brushing or rolling, but viscous enough to resist gravity as soon as<br>
the application procedure stops. Convenient thixotropic agents may be selected from:<br>
{fumed) silica, fatty acid amides, clays at a weight content from 0.2 to 5% with respect to<br>
the weight of B part.<br>
In the molding process in which the hybrid resins are typically used, generally two<br>
or more shaped elements cooperate with one another to define a mold cavity. Otherwise<br>
a single cavity of complex shape can be provided. The hybrid resin of the present<br>
invention is applied to at least a portion of the overall mold surface. The mold contact<br>
surfaces may be formed from any conventional materials such as glass, reinforced<br>
polyesters, epoxies, steel, aluminum or other metals.<br>
In one illustrative example, the A part or component of the hybrid resin comprises<br>
an isocyanate or an isocyanate solution in a non-interfering solvent such as styrene.<br>
Aliphatic isocyanates, such as 2,2,4-trimethyl-hexamethylene diisocyanate, are<br>
particularly well adapted for outdoor applications because of their resistance to yellowing<br>
or other discoloration relative to aromatic diisocyanates.<br>
The part B side or component comprises unsaturated polyester resin, wetting<br>
agents, leveling aids, a promotion package, fillers, polyurethane catalyst, viscosity<br>
modifiers and pigments. One typical formula, in parts by weight, comprises the following:<br><br>
-6-<br><br>
Component Description	Weight parts<br>
unsaturated polyester polyol	873.43<br>
black pigment dispersion	1.12<br>
yellow iron oxide pigment dispersion	1.80<br>
white pigment dispersion	92.83<br>
air release agent	2.5<br>
clay (quaternary ammonium treated)	12.48<br>

cobalt octoate solution	0.87<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate	1.25<br>
silicon fluid 200cSt-fisheye eliminator	1.25<br>
As is evident from the above formulations, the hybrid resins of this invention can<br>
contain one or more additives such as fillers, pigments, processing aids, curing aids, anti-<br>
oxidants, UV-inhibitors, catalyst promoters and the like. These additives can be included<br>
in either or both of the A and B parts although inclusion in the B part composition is<br>
more typical.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention. In these examples, all<br>
viscosity measurements were taken after the viscometer was running at the set speed for<br>
about 2 minutes.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of Unsaturated Polyester Resin (Comparative)<br>
Into a 4-liter flask equipped with agitator, condenser, thermometer, and pipe for<br>
introducing nitrogen gas were charged 740 grams of diethylene glycol, 456 grams of<br>
propylene glycol, 1060 grams of isophthalic acid. The mixture was heated at 210°C for<br>
about 10 hours until the acid number drops to 10 mg KOH/g. After the temperature was<br>
reduced to 150°C, 624 grams of maleic anhydride was added into the mixture. The<br>
reaction was continued at 210°C for another 6 hours to an acid number of 30 to 50 mg<br>
KOH/g. The product was blended with 1460 grams inhibited styrene to form 4000 grams<br>
clear resin solution (Resin A). The viscosity of resin solution is around 1000 mPa.s (cP) at<br>
63% solids content. The resin viscosity is measured by Brookfield viscometer with RVT<br>
#2 spindle at 20 rpm at 25°C.<br>
Example 2 Preparation of Conventional Gel Coat (Comparative)<br>

The resulting gel coat has a Brookfield viscosity of 19000 mPa.s (cP) at 4 rpm at<br>
77°C and a thixotropic index of 6.0-7.0 (RVF #4 spindle, 2/20 rpm). 1.8% methyl ethyl<br>
ketone peroxide (MEKP) is used to cure gel coat. The gel time is around 15 minutes and<br>
cure time is around 60 minutes. The weathering characteristics of the cured gel coat as<br>
measured by QUV-A, ASTM G154 using the standard 8 hours UV exposure at 60°C<br>
followed by 4 hours condensation at 50°C, are listed below.<br><br>

introducing nitrogen gas were charged 1380 grams of neopentyl glycol, 202 grams of<br>
propylene glycol, 994 grams of isophthalic acid. The mixture was heated at 210°C for<br>
about 10 hours until the acid number drops to 10 mg KOH/g. After the temperature was<br>
reduced to 150°C, 587 grains of maleic anhydride was added into the mixture. The<br>
reaction was continued at 210°C until an acid number of less than 5 mg KOH/g and an<br>
OH number of 130 to 150 mg KOH/g. The product was blended with 1160 grams<br>
inhibited styrene to form 4000 grams clear resin solution (Resin Bj. The viscosity of resin<br>
solution is 700 mPa.s (cP) at 71% solids content.<br>
Example 4 Preparation of Polyester-Polyurethane Hybrid Gel Coat<br>
A two-component gel coat composition is then prepared by blending the following<br>
ingredients to form the B-side component:<br><br>

Promoter	0.1<br>
The resulting gel coat has a Brookfield viscosity of 15000 mPa.s (cP) at 4 rpm at<br>
77°C and a thixotropic index of 5.0-6.0. The A-side component contains aliphatic<br>
diisocyanate and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). The A-side and B-side was mixed<br>
at the 20/80 ratio to cure the polyester-polyurethane hybrid gel coat. The gel time is<br>
around 15 minutes and cure time is around 60 minutes. The weathering characteristics<br>
of the gel coat as measured by QUV-A are listed below.<br><br>

Example 5 Comparison of 100 Hours Water Boil of Laminates<br>
The gel-coated laminates were prepared with the gel coat samples from example 2<br>
and 4. The laminate had two different thicknesses of gel coat. The thick section (TK) of<br>
gel coat had the cured gel coat thickness around 0.762 mm (30 mils) and the thin section<br>
(TN) of gel coat had the cured gel coat thickness around 0.381 mm (15 mils). The panels<br>
were immersed in boiling de-ionized water for 100 hours and the performance was rated<br>
in a scale of 0-5 at 5 different categories. The 0 rating was indication of no change and<br>
the 5 rating was indication of extreme change. The results indicated the Polyester-<br>
Polyurethane Hybrid gel coat has much better water resistance compared to the<br>
conventional gel coat.<br><br>

The reverse impact strength of gel-coated laminate was measured by following the<br>
a ASTM Standard D-3029. A total of 9 tests were conducted for each sample, and the<br>
average was reported. The results showed that the Polyester-Polyurethane Hybrid gel<br>
coat has much better reverse impact strength compared to conventional gel coat.<br><br>
