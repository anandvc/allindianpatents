				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new substituted benz-azole-like compounds and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters or prodrugs thereof, compositions of the new<br>
compounds together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and uses of the new<br>
compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent,<br>
in the prophylaxis or treatment of cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Raf serine/threonine kinases are essential components of the Ras/Mitogen-<br>
Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling module that controls a complex<br>
transcriptional program in response to external cellular stimuli. Raf genes code for highly<br>
conserved serine-threonine-specific protein kinases which are known to bind to the ras<br>
oncogene. They are part of a signal transduction pathway believed to consist of receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases, p21 ras, Raf protein kinases, Mek1 (ERK activator or MAPKK) kinases<br>
and ERK (MAPK) kinases, which ultimately phosphorylate transcription factors. In this<br>
pathway Raf kinases are activated by Ras and phosphorylate and activate two isoforms of<br>
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (called Mekl and Mek2), that are dual<br>
specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases. Both Mek isoforms activate Mitogen Activated<br>
Kinases 1 and 2 (MAPK, also called Extracellular Ligand Regulated Kinase 1 and 2 or<br>
Erkl and Erk2). The MAPKs phosphorylate many substrates including transcription<br>
factors and in so doing set up their transcriptional program. Raf kinase participation in<br>
the Ras/MAPK pathway influences and regulates many cellular functions such as<br>
proliferation, differentiation, survival, oncogenic transformation and apoptosis.<br>
Both the essential role and the position of Raf in many signaling pathways have<br>
been demonstrated from studies using deregulated and dominant inhibitory Raf mutants<br>
in mammalian cells as well as from studies employing biochemical and genetic<br>
techniques model organisms. In many cases, the activation of Raf by receptors that<br>
stimulate cellular tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of Ras, indicating<br>
that Ras functions upstream of Raf. Upon activation, Raf-1 then phosphorylates and<br>
activates Mekl, resulting in the propagation of the signal to downstream effectors, such<br>
as MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) (Crews et al. (1993) Cell 74:215). The Raf<br>
serine/threonine kinases are considered to be the primary Ras effectors involved in the<br>
proliferation of animal cells (Avruch et al. (1994) Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:279).<br>
Raf kinase has three distinct isoforms, Raf-1 (c-Raf), A-Raf, and B-Raf,<br>
distinguished by their ability to interact with Ras, to activate MAPK kinase pathway,<br>
tissue distribution and sub-cellular localization (Marias et. Al., Biochem. J. 351: 289-305,<br>
2000; Weber et. al., Oncogene 19:169-176, 2000; Pritchard et. al., Mol. Cell. Biol.<br>
15:6430-6442, 1995). Raf kinases are activated by Ras and phosphorylate and activate<br>
two isoforms of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (called Mekl and Mek2) that<br>
are dual specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases. Both Mek isoforms activate Mitogen<br>
Activated Kinases 1 and 2 (MAPK, also called Extracellular Ligand Regulated Kinase 1<br>
and 2 or Erkl and Erk2). The MAPKs phosphorylate many substrates including cytosolic<br>
proteins and ETS family of transcription factors. Raf kinase participation in the<br>
Ras/MAPK pathway influences and regulates many cellular functions such as<br>
proliferation, differentiationi survival, cell cycle progression and apoptosis.<br>
Activating mutation of one of the Ras genes can be seen in ~20% of all tumors<br>
and the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is activated in ~30% of all tumors (Bos et. al., Cancer<br>
Res. 49:4682-4689, 1989) (Hoshino et al., Oncogene 18:813-822, 1999). Recent studies<br>
have shown that B-Raf mutation in the skin nevi is a critical step in the initiation of<br>
melanocytic neoplasia (Pollock et. al.., Nature Genetics 25: 1-2, 2002). Furthermore,<br>
most recent studies have emerged that activating mutation in the kinase domain of B-Raf<br>
occurs in ~66% of melanomas, 12% of colon carcinoma and 14% of liver cancer (Davies<br>
et. al., Nature 417:949-954, 2002) (Yuen et. al., Cancer Research 62:6451-6455, 2002)<br>
(Brose et. al., Cancer Research 62:6997-7000, 2002).<br>
Inhibitors of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinases can potentially be<br>
effective as therapeutic agents against tumors with over-expressed or mutated receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases, activated intracellular tyrosine kinases, tumors with aberrantly<br>
expressed Grb2 (an adapter protein that allows stimulation of Ras by the Sos exchange<br>
factor) as well as tumors harboring activating mutations of Raf itself. In the early clinical<br>
trails inhibitor of Raf-1 kinase that also inhibit B-Raf have shown promise as therapeutic<br>
agents in cancer therapy (Crump, Current Pharmaceutical Design 8: 2243-2248, 2002;<br>
Sebastien et. al., Current Pharmaceutical Design 8: 2249-2253, 2002).<br>
Disruption of Raf expression in cell lines through the application of RNA<br>
antisense technology has been shown to suppress both Ras and Raf-mediated<br>
tumorigenicity (Kolch et al., Nature 349:416-428, 1991; Monia et al., Nature Medicine<br>
2(6):668-675, 1996).<br>
Several Raf kinase inhibitors have been described as exhibiting efficacy in<br>
inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vitro and/or in vivo assays (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
6,391,636, 6,358,932, 6,037,136, 5,717,100, 6,458,813, 6,204,467, and 6,268,391). Other<br>
patents and patent applications suggest the use of Raf kinase inhibitors for treating<br>
leukemia (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,391, and 6,204,467, and published U.S. Patent<br>
Application Nos. 20020137774; 20020082192; 20010016194; and 20010006975), or for<br>
treating breast cancer (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,358,932, 5,717,100, 6,458,813,<br>
6,268,391, and 6,204,467, and published U.S. Patent Application No. 20010014679).<br>

comprising at least one compound of formula I, II, III, IV or V together with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for administration to a human or animal<br>
subject, either alone or together with other anticancer agents.<br>
In other aspects, the present invention provides methods of manufacture of<br>
compounds of formula I, II, III, IV or V as described herein.<br>
In yet other aspects, the present invention provides compounds which are<br>
inhibitors of the enzyme raf kinase. Since the enzyme is a downstream effector of p21ras,<br>
the instant inhibitors are useful in pharmaceutical compositions for human or veterinary<br>
use where inhibition of the raf kinase pathway is indicated, e.g., in the treatment of<br>
tumors and/or cancerous cell growth mediated by raf kinase. In particular, the<br>
compounds are useful in the treatment of human or animal, e.g., murine cancer, since the<br>
progression of these cancers is dependent upon the ras protein signal transduction cascade<br>
and therefore is susceptible to treatment by interruption of the cascade by inhibiting raf<br>
kinase activity. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating solid<br>
cancers, such as, for example, carcinomas (e.g., of the lungs, pancreas, thyroid, bladder or<br>
colon, myeloid disorders (e.g., myeloid leukemia) or adenomas (e.g., villous colon<br>
adenoma).<br>
"Raf inhibitor" is used herein to refer to a compound that exhibits an IC50 with<br>
respect to Raf Kinase activity of no more than about 100 µM and more typically not more<br>
than about 50 uM, as measured in the Raf/Mek Filtration Assay described generally<br>
hereinbelow. Preferred isoforms of Raf Kinase in which the compounds of the present<br>
invention will be shown to inhibit, include A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (Raf-1). "IC50" is<br>
that concentration of inhibitor which reduces the activity of an enzyme (e.g., Raf kinase)<br>
to half-maximal level. Representative compounds of the present invention have been<br>
discovered to exhibit inhibitory activity against Raf. Compounds of the present invention<br>
preferably exhibit an IC50 with respect to Raf of no more than about 10 µM, more<br>
preferably, no more than about 5 uM, even more preferably not more than about 1 µM,<br>
and most preferably, not more than about 200 nM, as measured in the Raf kinase assays<br>

-CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)3, -CH(CH3)CH2.<br>
CH(CH3)2, -CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2, -CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3),<br>
and others. The phrase also includes cyclic alkyl. groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl and such rings substituted with<br>
straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above. Thus the phrase alkyl groups<br>
includes primary alkyl groups, secondary alkyl groups, and tertiary alkyl groups.<br>
Preferred alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups and cyclic alkyl<br>
groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>

In other aspects, the present invention relates to the processes for preparing the<br>
compounds of Formulas I, II, in, IV and V and to the synthetic intermediates useful in<br>
such processes.<br>
The compounds of the invention comprise asymmetrically substituted carbon<br>
atoms. Such asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can result in the compounds of the<br>
invention comprising mixtures of stereoisomers at a particular asymmetrically substituted<br>
carbon atom or a single stereoisomer. As a result, racemic mixtures, mixtures of<br>
diastereomers, as well as single diastereomers of the compounds of the invention are<br>
included in the present invention. The terms "S" and "R" configuration, as used herein,<br>
are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECTION E, FUNDAMENTAL<br>
STEREOCHEMISTRY, Pure Appl. Chem. 45:13-30 (1976). The terms a and ß are employed<br>
for ring positions of cyclic compounds. The a-side of the reference plane is that side on<br>
which the preferred substituent lies at the lower numbered position. Those substituents<br>
lying on the opposite side of the reference plane are assigned ß descriptor. It should be<br>
noted that this usage differs from that for cyclic stereoparents, in which "a" means<br>
"below the plane" and denotes absolute configuration. The terms a and ß configuration,<br>
as used herein, are as defined by the CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS INDEX GUIDE-APPENDIX IV<br>
(1987) paragraph 203.<br>
The present invention also relates to the processes for preparing the compounds of<br>
the invention and to the synthetic intermediates useful in such processes, as described in<br>
detail below.<br>
Synthetic Methods<br>
Compounds of the invention containing a benzimidazole core may be prepared<br>
using a number of methods familiar to one of skill in the art. In one method, suitably<br>
functionalized diamines may be coupled with various thioisocyanates to form the<br>
intermediate thioureas. Cyclization to form the benzimidazole moiety may be effected '<br>
under known conditions such as with treatment carbodiimides or alkyl halides as in the<br>
following schemes.<br>
Alternatively the diamines may be reacted sequentially with carbonyl diimidazole<br>
and phosphoryl chloride followed by coupling with the appropriate amine.<br>
Compounds containing the oxazole structure may similarly be prepared according<br>
to the methods above or according to other known general procedures. Haviv et al. (J.<br>
Med. Chem. 1988, 31:1719) describes a procedure for assembling oxazole cores wherein<br>
a hydroxy aniline is treated with ethyl potassium xanthate. The resulting sulfuryl<br>
benzoxazole may then be chlorinated and coupled with an amine.<br>
Compounds containing a benzothiazole core may also be prepared according to<br>
known methods. An ortho-halothioisocyanate may be reacted with an amine to form a<br>
thiourea. Reduction with NaH then allows formation of the thiazole ring.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in inhibiting the<br>
growth of cancer cells. The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers or excipients include, for example, processing agents and drug<br>
delivery modifiers and enhancers, such as, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium<br>
stearate,-talc, monosaccharides, disaccharides, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose,<br>
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, dextrose, hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin, polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidinone, low melting waxes, ion exchange resins, and the like, as well as<br>
combinations of any two or more thereof. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Pub. Co., New<br>
Jersey (1991), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any<br>
amount sufficient to detectably inhibit Raf activity by any of the assays described herein,<br>
by other Raf kinase activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art or by<br>
detecting an inhibition or alleviation of symptoms of cancer.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials<br>
to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the<br>
particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose<br>
level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity<br>
of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time<br>
of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the<br>
severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeutically effective<br>
amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is<br>
within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose will<br>
generally be a total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in<br>
amounts, for example, of from 0.001 to 1000mg/kg body weight daily and more<br>
preferred from 1.0 to 30 mg/kg body weight daily. Dosage unit compositions may<br>
contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally,<br>
sublingually, by aerosolization or inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit<br>
formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of<br>
transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices. The<br>
term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a<br>
sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-propanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles<br>
and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium<br>
chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent<br>
or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the<br>
drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols,<br>
which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will<br>
therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be<br>
admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage<br>
forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert<br>
diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills<br>
can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents<br>
commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise<br>
adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, cyclodextrins, and<br>
sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
lipqsomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or<br>
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically<br>
acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The<br>
present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the<br>
present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids<br>
are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic.<br>
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed.,<br>
Metiiods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.W., p. 33 etseq.<br>
(1976).<br>
While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active<br>
pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more other agents<br>
used in the treatment of cancer. Representative agents useful in combination with the<br>
compounds of the invention for the treatment of cancer include, for example, irinotecan,<br>
topotecan, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin carboplatin, cisplatin, taxanes,<br>
tezacitabine, cyclophosphamide, vinca alkaloids, imatinib (Gleevec), anthracyclines,<br>
rituximab, trastuzumab, as well as other cancer chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The above compounds to be employed in combination with the compounds of the<br>
invention will be used in therapeutic amounts as indicated in the Physicians' Desk<br>
Reference (PDR) 47th Edition (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference, or such<br>
therapeutically useful amounts as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
The compounds of the invention and the other anticancer. agents can be<br>
administered at the recommended maximum clinical dosage or at lower doses. Dosage<br>
levels of the active compounds in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as<br>
to obtain a desired therapeutic response depending on the route of administration, severity<br>
of the disease and the response of the patient. The combination can be administered as<br>
separate compositions or as a single dosage form containing both agents. When<br>
administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate<br>
compositions, which are given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic<br>
agents, can be given as a single composition.<br>
Antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction<br>
of cell cycle arrest, that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it<br>
has been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the<br>
phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell<br>
cycle is attenuated, thereby contributing to antiestrogen resistance (Donovan et al, J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 275:40888, 2001). As reported by Donovan et al., inhibition of MAPK signaling<br>
through treatment with MEK inhibitor changed the phosphorylation status of p27 in<br>
hormone refactory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) may<br>
be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate<br>
cancers, to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional<br>
anticancer agents.<br>
In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),<br>
chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-AB1<br>
tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to Geevec, a small molecule<br>
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However, many<br>
patients with advanced stage disease respond to Gleevec initially, but then relapse later<br>
due to resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have<br>
demonstrated that BCR-Avl employs the Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In<br>
addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional<br>
protection against resistance-conferring mutations. Accordingly, in another aspect of the<br>
invention, the compounds of formulas (I), (II), (HI), (IV) and (V) are used in combination<br>
with at least one additional agent, such as Gleevec, in the treatment of hematological<br>
cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to reverse or prevent resistance<br>
to the at least one additional agent.<br>

A solution of Pd(OAc)2 (4.5 mg, 0.02 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (13.1 mg<br>
0.05 mmol) in dry NMP (1 mL) was stirred at.rt for 20 min. Aryl iodide 1 (100 mg, 0.2<br>
mmol), 3-furyl boronic acid (45 mg, 0.4 mmol), and triethylamine (0.11 mL, 0.8 mmol)<br>
were added and the resulting solution was degassed and purged with Ar. The reaction<br>
was heated to 100°C for 2 h; LCMS indicated no conversion. The reaction was allowed<br>
to cool to rt under Ar and Pd(dppf)Cl2CH2Cl2 and diisopropylethylamine (0.14 mL) were<br>
added. The reaction was heated to 100 °C and maintained overnight. The reaction was<br>
allowed to cool to rt and LCMS indicated complete conversion. The reaction was<br>
partitioned between saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution and EtOAc and the resulting<br>
mixture filtered through Celite. The remaining solids were washed with water and<br>
EtOAc. The combined rinsings were partitioned and separated. The aqueous phase was<br>
extracted with EtOAc (3 X) and the combined organic portions were washed with<br>
96 well filtration plates: Millipore Immobilon 1 #MAIP NOB<br>
Scintillation fluid: Wallac OptiPhase "SuperMix" #1200-439<br>
Assay conditions<br>
Raf approximately 120 pM<br>
Mek approximately 60 nM<br>
33P-ATP 100 nM<br>
Reaction time 45-60 minutes at room temperature<br>
Assay protocol<br>
Raf and Mek were combined at 2X final concentrations in assay buffer (50 mM<br>
Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2. 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) and dispensed 15 ul per<br>
well in polypropylene assay plates (Falcon U-bottom polypropylene 96 well assay plates<br>
#35-1190. Background levels are determined in wells containing Mek and DMSO<br>
without Raf.<br>
To the Raf/Mek containing wells was added 3 ul of 10X of a raf kinase inhibitor<br>
test compound diluted in 100% DMSO. The raf kinase activity reaction was started by<br>
the addition of 12 ul per well of 2.5X 33P-ATP diluted in assay buffer. After 45-60<br>
minutes, the reactions were stopped with the addition of 70 ul of stop reagent (30 mM<br>
EDTA). Filtration plates were pre-wetted for 5 min with 70% ethanol, and then rinsed by<br>
filtration with wash buffer. Samples (90 ul) from the reaction wells were then transferred<br>
to the filtration plates. The filtration plates were washed 6X with wash buffer using<br>
Millipore filtration apparatus. The plates were dried and 100 µl per well of scintillation<br>
fluid (Wallac OptiPhase "SuperMix" #1200-439) was added. The CPM is then<br>
determined using a Wallac Microbeta 1450 reader.<br>

ASSAY 2: Biotinvlated Raf Screen<br>
In Vitro Raf Screen<br>
The activity of various isoforms of Raf serine/threonine kinases can be measured<br>
by providing ATP, MEK substrate, and assaying the transfer of phosphate moiety to the<br>
MEK residue. Recombinant isoforms of Raf were obtained by purification from sf9<br>
insect cells infected with a human Raf recombinant baculovirus expression vector.<br>
Recombinant kinase inactive MEK was expressed in E. coli and labeled with Biotin post<br>
purification. For each assay, test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO then mixed<br>
with Raf (0.50 nM) and kinase inactive biotin-MEK (50 nM) in reaction buffer plus ATP<br>
(1 uM). Reactions were subsequently incubated for 2 hours at room temperature and<br>
stopped by the addition of 0.5 M EDTA. Stopped reaction mixture was transferred to a<br>
neutradavin-coated plate (Pierce) and incubated for 1 hour. Phosphorylated product was<br>
measured with the DELFIA time-resolved fluorescence system (Wallac), using a rabbit<br>
anti-p-MEK (Cell Signaling) as the primary antibody and europium labeled anti-rabbit as<br>
the secondary antibody. Time resolved fluorescence was read on a Wallac 1232 DELFIA<br>
fluorometer. The concentration of each compound for 50% inhibition (IC50) was<br>
calculated by non-linear regression using XL Fit data analysis software.<br>
Using the procedures of Examples 1116 or 1117, the compounds of Examples 1-<br>
1094 were shown to have a raf kinase inhibitory activity at an IC50 of less than 5 µM.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
