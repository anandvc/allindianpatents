				<td>PRODUCTION OF OLEFINS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for converting a hydrocarbon feedstock to produce<br>
an effluent containing light olefins, in particular propylene.<br>
There is an increasing demand for light olefins, for example ethylene and propylene, in the<br>
petrochemical industry, in particular for the production of polymers, in particular polyethylene<br>
and polypropylene, In particular, propylene has become an increasingly valuable product and<br>
accordingly there has been a need for the conversion of various hydrocarbon feedstocks to<br>
produce propylene.<br>
Increasing amounts of stranded or associated natural gas are being found throughout the<br>
world. It becomes important to valorize these gas reserves, not only as fuel but if possible as a<br>
carbon source for chemicals and liquid transportable fuel. One way of doing this is the<br>
conversion of natural gas into synthesis gas and consequently synthesis of methanol that can<br>
serve as a primary source of other chemicals or liquid fuels.<br>
It has been known for a number of years to convert low molecular weight monohydric<br>
alcohols such as methanol into light olefins, with the effluent containing ethylene and<br>
propylene. Methanol can readily be product from methane present in natural gas, which is in <br>
abundant supply, and is in oversupply in some oil-producing regions of the world. There is<br>
therefore a need to produce light olefins such as ethylene and propylene from feedstocks<br>
derived from natural gas.<br>
The conversion of a feed containing C1 to C4 monohydric alcohols to olefinic hydrocarbons<br>
including ethylene and propylene has been known at least since the 1970's. For example US-<br>
A-4148835 in the name ofMobil Oil Corporation discloses a catalytic process for converting<br>
a feed containing aC1-C4 monohydric alcohol, in particular methanol, by contact of the<br>
alcohol, under conversion conditions, with a catalyst comprisigng a craystalised alumina silicate<br>
zeolite having a crystallite size at least about 1 micron, a silica to alumina ratio of at least<br><br>
about 12 and a constraint index within the approximate range of 1 to 12. In particular, the<br>
zeolite comprises ZSM 5. The effluent from the methanol conversion inchludes ethylene and<br>
propylene. The problem ofthe process disclosed in US-A-4148835 is that the propylene yield<br>
is not very high and (here is a need to increase the propylene yield of the conversion process.<br>
EP-A-0123449 (and its equivalent US-A-4788377), also in the name of Mobil Oil<br>
Corporation, disclose a process for converting alcohols/ethers, especially methanol, into<br>
olefins over zeolite catalysts. Olefin selectivity is enhanced by using zeolites of crystal size<br>
less man 1 micron and which have been steamed to alpha values of not more man SO,<br>
preferably 5 to 35. However, although the mixture of olefins produced contains mostly<br>
emylene, propylene and the butylenes with small pentenes component, thyere is no disclosure<br>
of a process which has a high propylene selectivity.<br>
DE-A-2935863 (and its equivalent US-A-4849753), also in the name of Mobil Oil<br>
Corporation, disclose &amp; process for producing light olefins by catalyticaily converting<br>
methanol over crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites having high silica to alumina ratios at<br>
temperatures of from about 350 to 600°C and at pressures ranging between about 1 and 100<br>
atmospheres.<br>
It is also known in the art to convert methanol to light olefins using a silica- alumina-<br>
phosphate catalyst, known as SAPO catalysts. It was considered that such catalysts had a<br>
higher selectivity to light olefins than the alumino-silicate zeolite catalysts employed in,for<br>
example, US-A-4148835. For example, US-A-4861938, US-A-5126308 andEP-A-0558839,<br>
all in the name of UOP, each disclose a process for the conversion of methanol into light<br>
olefins, in particular ethylene and propylene, using a silica- alumina-phosphate catalyst, in<br>
particular SAPO 34. These processes suffer from the problem mat, m particular, when used in<br>
a fixed reactor, the selectivity to propylene of the catalyst is poor, and additionally too much<br>
emylene is produced, leading to a relatively low propyierte/ethylene molar ratio. This lowers<br>
the propylene purity in a fractionated cut containing C2 and C3 hydrocarbons. Ako^<br>
of the production of propane, the propylene purity in a C3 cut may be low. Furthermore, the<br>
propylene selectivity tends not to be stable over time. There is therefore a need to provide a<br><br>
conversion  process which has a higher propylene selectivity that these known processes.<br>
BP-A-0882692 discloses a process for the production of lower olefins with 2-3C atoms which<br>
comprises reacting a methanol and/or dimethylether vapour and a reaction mixture containing<br>
water vapour in a first reactor on a first form selective catalyst at 280-570 °C and 0.1-1 bar;<br>
withdrawing a product mixture containing 2-4C olefin and 5C+ hydrocarbon from the first<br>
reactor, and cooling. The cooled first product mixture is fed through a separator and a second<br>
product mixture containing ethylene and propylene is withdrawn. A 5C+ stream is obtained,<br>
which is vaporised and mixed with water vapour. A ratio of H 20:hydrocarbons of 0.5-3:1 is<br>
uesed. The mixture containing vapour is fed at is fed at 380- 700°C to a second reactor<br>
a second form selective catalyst. A third product mixture is withdrawn from the second reactor<br>
which contains 50% olefinic components. This product mixture is cooled and fed to a<br>
separator. The catalyst in the first reactor may be a zeolite as disclosed in HP-B-0448000, a<br>
SAPO catalyst as disclosed in US-A-4524235 and HP-A-0142156, or a silicalite catalyst as<br>
disclosed in US-A-4061724. The catalyst in the second reactor may be a zeolite of the<br>
Pentasil-type having a silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of from 10:1 to 200:1, variants of such<br>
catalysts being disclosed in BP-B-0369364, a SAPO catalyst or a silicalite catalyst.<br>
It is also known to crack catalytically an olefin-confaining feedstock using a crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst, for example from WO-A-99/29802. It would be desirable to improve the flexibility<br>
of this process with regard to the feedstocks 10 be used and to improve the propylene purity of<br>
the effluent Also, it would be desirable to be able to improve the heat balance of the reactor<br>
used for the catalytic cracking process.<br>
It is further known to use a crystalline silicate crackmg catalyst to produce light olefins such<br>
as ethylene. For example, WO-A-98/56877 discloses a process for improving the conversion<br>
of a light hydrocarbon feedstock to light olefins comprising the steps of first contacting the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock with a light olefin producing cracking catalyst, such as a ZSM-5<br>
zeolite, and subsequently thermally cracking the unseparated stream to produce additional<br>
ethylene.<br>
In a first paper entitled "CMHC: coupled methanol hydrocarbon cracking. Formation of lower<br><br>
olefins from methanol and hydrocarbons over modified zeolites" by Bemhard Locke et aL<br>
Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 29 (1999) 145 -157 (Elsevier Science Publising,<br>
New York, USA, 06-99, 29(1-2) (XP4167556) it is disclosed that coupled methanol<br>
hydrocarbon cracking was carried out using, inter alia,C4 olefins (in particular iso-butene or a<br>
mixture of 45% iso-butene, 27% n-butene-(l), 15% n-butene-(2) and 13% n-+i-butane) co-<br>
red with methanol (Table 3). The catalyst was a zeolite with an MFI structure (H-ZSM-5)<br>
with a Si/Al ratio (after synthesis) of about 16-30. The temperature was 873 K or 953 K.<br>
The effluent contained ethylene and propylene, as well as BTX aromatics, methane and others.<br>
However, the time-on-stream was only a few hours. The authors noted that the parent H-<br>
ZSM-5 zeolite samples were subjected to fast deactivation due to rapid coking and<br>
dealumination and proposed a number of routes to modify the zeolite to increase the<br>
deactivation resistance. One of these routes was to steam the catalyst at 775K (denoted by<br>
"D" for "dealumination").<br>
A second paper, by three of the same authors as the first paper, entitled "Coupled<br>
methanol/hydrocarbon cracking (CMHC) - A new route to lower olefins from methanol" by<br>
S. Nowak et al, Chemical Industries (1992), 46,361-80, (XP8025670) similarly discloses the<br>
use of an industrial H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 16, and some catalyst samples had<br>
been pretreated by dealumination by steam treatment with subsequent acid leaching to<br>
rearrange the extra-framework Al formed.<br>
In a further paper by substantially the same authors entitled "An improved method for<br>
producing lower olefins and gasoline by coupled methanol/hydrocarbon cracking (CHMC)"<br>
by S. Nowak et aL Proceedings of 9th International Congress on Catalysis, (1988), 4,1735 -<br>
42 (XP8025672), the catalyst was an H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (after<br>
synthesis) of 31 - 55. For a methanol/1-butene or C4 fraction feed (Figure 6) the results are<br>
the same as for Table 3 of document (XP4167556) discussed above.<br>
In a yet further paper entitled "Coupled conversion of methanol and C4 hydrocarbons<br>
(CHMC) on iron-containing ZSM-5 type zeolites" by A. Martin et al Applied Catalysis, 57,<br>
(1990) 203 - 214 (Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands (XP8025673),<br>
substantially the same authors iron-containing and iron-aluminium-containing ZSM-%<br><br>
catalysts were used, and one comparative catalyst had a Si/Al ratio of 22.<br>
DD-A-270296 (having as inventors substantially the same persons as the authors of the above<br>
four papers) discloses a process for producing lower olefins using a Fe-Al-Si zeolite catalyst.<br>

The process of the present invention comprises passing a hydrocarbon feedstock, comprising a<br>
mixture of a first portion, containing one or more olefins of C4 or greater, and a second<br>
portion, containing at least one C1 To Whom It May Concern: C6 aliphatic hetero compounds selected from alcohols,<br>
ethers, carbonyl compounds and mixtures thereof, through a reactor containing such a<br>
crystalline silicate catalyst, in order to product an effluent containing light olefins, particularly<br>
propylene.<br>
The catalytic cracking of olefins is performed in the sense that olefins in the olefin-containing<br>
first portion of the combined hydrocarbon stream are cracked into lighter olefins and<br>
selectively into propylene. The olefin-containing portion of feedstock may comprise any kind<br>
of olefin containing hydrocarbon stream. The olefin-containing portion of the feedstock may<br>
typically comprise from 10 to 100wt% olefins and furthermore may be fed undiluted or<br>
diluted by a diluent, the diluent optionally including a non-olefinic hydrocarbon.In particular,	<br>
the olefin-containing portion may be a hydrocarbon mixture containing normal and branched<br>
olefins in the carbon range C4 to C10, more preferably in the carbon range C4 to C6, optionally<br>
in a mixture with normal and branched paraffins and/or aromatics in the carbon range C4 to<br>
C1O. Typically, the olefm-containing stream has a boiling point of from around -15°Cto<br>
around 180°C.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the olefm-containing portion<br>
of the hydrocarbon feedstocks may comprise C4 mixtures from refineries and steam cracking<br>
units. Such steam cracking units crack a wide variety of feedstocks, including ethane,<br>
propane, butane, naphtha, gas oil, fuel oil, etc. Most particularly, the olefin containing portion<br><br>
of the hydrocarbon feedstock may comprises a C4 cut from a fluidized-bed catalytic cracking<br>
(FCC) unit in a crude oil refinery which is employed for converting heavy oil into gasoline<br>
and lighter products. Typically, such a C4 cat from an FCC unit comprises around50wt%<br>
olefin. Alternatively, the olefin-containing portion of the hydrocarbon feedstock may<br>
comprise a C4 cut from a unit within a crude oil refinery for producing medryltert-butyl ether<br>
(MTBE) which is prepared from methanol and isobutene. Again, such a C4 cut from the<br>
MTBE unit typically comprises around 50wr% olefin. These C4 cuts are fractionated at the<br>
outlet of the respective FCC or MTBE unit The olefin-containing portion of the hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock may yet further comprise a C4 cut from a naphtha steam-cracking unit of a<br>
petrochemical plant in which naphtha, comprising C5 to C9 species having a boiling point<br>
range of from about 15 to 180°C, is steam cracked to produce, inter alia, &amp;C4 cut Such a C4<br>
cut typically comprises,by weight, 40 to 50% 1,3-butadiene, around 25% isobutylene, around<br>
15% butene (in the form of but-1-ene and/or but-2-ene) and around 10% n-butane and/or<br>
isobutane. The olefin-containing portion of the hydrocarbon feedstock may also comprise a<br>
C4 cut from a steam cracking unit after butadiene extraction (raffinate 1), or after butadiene<br>
hydrogenation, thereby comprising a hydrotreated C4 stream (known in the art as a<br>
"hydrotreated raw C4 "stream), or a raw C4 feedstock, or a raffinate 2 feedstock from an<br>
MTBB or an ethyl tert-butyl ether(BTBE) unit, or a raffinate from an olefins metathesis unit<br>
The olefin-containing portion of the feedstock may yet further alternatively comprise a<br>
hydrogenated butadiene-rich C4 cut, typically containing greater man 50wt%C4 as an olefin.<br>
Alternatively, the olefin-containing portion of the hydrocarbon feedstock could comprise a<br>
pure olefin feedstock which has been produced in a petrochemical plant<br>
The olefin-containing portion of the feedstock may yet further alternatively comprise light<br>
cracked naphtha (LCN) (otherwise known as light catalytic cracked spirit (LCCS)) or a C5 cut<br>
from a steam cracker or light cracked naphtha, the light cracked naphtha being fractionated<br>
from the effluent of te FCC unit, discussed hereinabove, in a crude oil refinery. Both such<br>
feedstocks contain olefins. The olefin-containing portion of the feedstock may yet further<br>
alternatively comprise a medium cracked naphtha from such an FCC unit or visbroken<br>
naphtha obtained from a visbreaking unit for treating the residue of a vacuum distillation unit<br>
in a crude oil refinery or a coker naphtha. The olefin-containing portion of the feedstock may<br><br>
alternatively comprise a raffinate 2 feedstock, containing olefins but having a high isoparaffin<br>
content<br>
The olefin-containing portion of die feedstock may alternatively comprise or include a<br>
product, which contains C4+olefins, of a methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, for example as<br>
described inUS-A-4148835, EP-A-0123449, and DE- A-2935863, and its equivalent US-A-<br>
4849753 discussed hereinabove. A fraction, which contains C4+olefins, of the effluent of the<br>
process of the present invention may be recycled back through the reactor thereby to constitute<br>
at least a part of the olefin feed for the process of the invention.<br>
The olefin-containjng portion of the feedstock may comprise a mixture of one or more of the<br>
above-described feedstocks.<br>
The use of a C5 cut as or in the olefin-containing portion of the hydrocarbon feedstock has<br>
particular advantages because of the need to remove C5 species in any event from gasolines<br>
produced by the oil refinery. This is because the presence of C5 in gasoline increases the<br>
ozone potential and thus the photochemical activity of the resulting gasoline. In the case of<br>
the use of light cracked naphtha as the olefin-containing portion of the feedstock, the olefin<br>
content of the remaining gasoline fraction is reduced, thereby reducing the vapour pressure<br>
and also the photochemical activity of the gasoline.<br>
The catalytic conversion of the second portion of the hydrocarbon steam containing at least<br>
one C1 to C6aliphatic hetero compound selected from alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds<br>
and mixture thereof, is performed to produce in the effluent fight olefins, mpardcularemylene<br>
and propylene, and selectively propylene.<br>
The C1 to C6 aliphatic alcohols may be monohydric and straight or branched and may be<br>
selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol.The ethers may be C2 to C4 ethers<br>
selected from dimethyl ether, diethyl ether or methyl ethyl ether. The carbonyl compounds<br>
maybe C2 to C4 carbonyl compounds selected from formaldehyde, dimethyl ketone, or acetic<br>
acid. The second portion of the feedstock is most preferably selected from methanol, ethanol,<br>
dimethyl ether, diethyl ether and mixtures thereof, with methanol being particularly preferred.<br><br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the combined hydrocarbon feedstocks<br>
containing the first and second portions, are selectively converted in the presence of an MFI-<br>
type or MEL-type catalyst so as to produce propylene in the resultant effluent The catalyst<br>
and process conditions are selected whereby the process has a particular yield towards<br>
propylene in the effluent.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, the catalyst comprises a<br>
crystalline silicate of the MFI family which may be a zeolite, a silicalite or any other silicate in<br>
that taniily or the MEL family which may be a zeolite or any other silicon in that family. The<br>
three-letter designations "MFT and "MEL" each represent a particular crystalline silicate<br>
structure type as established by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite<br>
Association. Examples of MFI silicates are ZSM-5 and silicalite. An example of an MEL<br>
zeolite is ZSM-11 which is known in the art. Other examples are BorahteD, and silicalite-2<br>
as described by the International Zeolite Association (Atlas of zeolite structure types, 1987,<br>
Butterworths).<br>
The preferred crystalline silicates have pores or channels defined by ten oxygen rings and a<br>
high silicon/aluminium atomic ratio.<br>
Crystalline silicates are microporous crystalline inorganic polymers based on a framework of<br>
XO4 tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing of oxygen ions, where X may be trivalent(e.g.<br>
A1,B,...)ortetravalent(e.g. Ge,Si,...). The crystal stnictureofacrystallmesmcaie is defined<br>
by the specific order in which a network of tetrahedral units are linked together. The size of<br>
the crystalline silicate pore openings is determined by the number of tetrahedral units, or,<br>
alternatively, oxygen atoms, required to form the pores and the nature of the cations that are<br>
present in the pores. They possess a unique combination of the following properties: high<br>
internal surface area; uniform pores with one or more discrete sizes; ion exchangeability; good<br>
thermal stability; and ability to adsorb organic compounds. Since the pores of these<br>
crystalline silicates are similar in size to many organic molecules of practical interest, they<br>
control the ingress and egress of reactants and products, resulting in particular selectivity in<br>
catalytic reactions. Crystalline silicates with the MFI structure possess a bi-directional<br>
intersecting pore system with the following pore diameters: a straight channel along [010]:<br><br>
0.53^.56nmand a sirmsoidal channel along[100]:0.51-0.55nm. Cystalline silicates with the<br>
MEL structure possess a bi-directional intersecting straight pore system with straight channels<br>
along [100] having pore diameters of 0.53-0.54 nm.<br>
The crystalline silicate catalyst has structural and chemical properties and is emloyed under<br>
particular reaction conditions whereby the catalytic conversion to form light olefins, in<br>
particular propylene, readily proceeds.<br>
The catalyst has a high silicon/aluminium atomic ratio, whereby the cataryst has relatively low<br>
acidity. In this specification, the term "silicon/alummium atomic ratio" is intended to mean<br>
the Si/A1 atomic ratio of the overall material, which may be determined by chemical analysis,<br>
In particular, for crystalline silicate materials, the stated Si/Al ratios apply not just to the Si/Al<br>
framework of the crystalline silicate but rather to the whole material.<br>
Different reaction pathways can occur on me catalyst Hydrogen transfer reactions are directly<br>
related to the strength and density of the acid sites on the catalyst, and such reactions are<br>
preferably suppressed by the use of high Si/Al ratios so as to avoid the formation of coke<br>
during the conversion process, thereby increasing the stability of the catalyst Moreover, the<br>
use of high Si/Al atomic ratios has been found to increase the propylene selectivity of the<br>
catalyst, i.e. to reduce the amount of propane produced and/or to increase the<br>
propylene/ethylene ratio. This increases the purity of the resultant propylene,<br>
In accordance with one aspect, a first type of MFI catalyst has a high silicon/aluminum atomic<br>
ratio, e.g. at least about 180, preferably greater than about 200, more preferably greater than<br>
about 250, whereby the catalyst has relatively low acidity. Hydrogen transfer reactions are<br>
directly related to the strength and density of the acid sites on the catalyst, and such reactions<br>
are preferably suppressed so as to avoid the progressive formation of coke which in turn<br>
would otherwise decrease the stability of the catalyst over time. Such hydrogen transfer<br>
reactions tend to produce saturates such as paraffins, intermediate unstable dienes and cyclc-<br>
olefins, and aromatics, none of which favours conversion into light olefins. Cyclo-olefins are<br>
precursors of aromatics and coke-like molecules, especially in the presence of solid acids, i.e.<br>
an acidic solid catalyst The acidity of the catalyst can be determined by the amount of<br><br>
residual ammonia on the catalyst following contact of the catalyst with ammonia which<br>
adsorbs to the acid sites on the catalyst with subsequent ammonium desorption at elevated<br>
temperature measured by differential thermogravimetric analysis. Preferably, the<br>
silicon/aluminum ratio ranges from 180 to 1000, most preferably from 250 to 500.<br>
With such high silicon/aluminum ratio in the crystalline silicate catalyst, a stable conversion<br>
of the hydrocarbon feedstock can be achieved, with a high propylene yield. Such high<br>
silicon/aluminum ratios in the catalyst reduce the acidity of the catalyst, thereby also<br>
increasing the stability of the catalyst<br>
The MFI catalyst having a high silicon/aluminum atomic ratio for use in the catalytic<br>
conversion process of the present invention may be manufactured by removing aluminum<br>
from a commercially available crystalline silicate. A typical commercially available silicalite<br>
has a silicon/aluminum atomic ratio of around 120. The commercially available MFI<br>
crystalline silicate may be modified by a steaming process which reduces the tetrahedral<br>
aluminum in the crystalline silicate framework and converts the aluminum atoms into<br>
octahedral aluminum in the form of amorphous alumina. Although in the steaming step<br>
aluminum atoms chemically removed from the crystalline silicate framework structure to<br>
form alumina particles, those particles cause partial obstruction of the pores or channels in the<br>
framework. This inhibits the conversion processes of the present invention. Accordingly,<br>
following the steaming step, the crystalline silicate is subjected to an extraction step wherem<br>
amorphous alumina is removed from the pores and the micropore volume is, at least partially,<br>
recovered. The physical removal, by a leaching step, of the amorphous alumina from the<br>
pores by the formation of a water-soluble aluminum complex yields the overall effect of de-<br>
alumination of the MFI crystalline silicate. In this way by removing aluminum from the MFI<br>
crystalline silicate framework and then removing alumina formed therefrom from the pores,<br>
the process aims at achieving a substantially homogeneous de-alumination throughout the<br>
whole pore surfaces of the catalyst This reduces the acidity of the catalyst, and thereby<br>
reduces the occurrence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the conversion process. The<br>
reduction of acidity ideally occurs substantially homogeneously throughout the pores defined<br>
in the crystalline silicate framework. This is because in the hydrocarbon conversion process<br>
hydrocarbon species can enter deeply into the pores. Accordingly, the reduction of acidity and<br><br>
thus the reduction in hydrogen transfer reactions which would reduce the stability of the MFI<br>
catalyst are pursued throughout the whole pore structure in the framework. The framework<br>
silicon/aluminum ratio may be increased by this process to a value of at least about 180,<br>
preferably from about 180 to 1000, more preferably at least 200, yet more preferably at least<br>
250, and most preferably from 250 to 500.<br>
In the two papers entitled "CMHC: coupled methanol hydrocarbon cracking. Formation of<br>
lower olefins from methanol and hydrocarbons over modified zeolites" by Bemhard Locke et<br>
al, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 29 (1999) 145 - 157 (Elsevier Science<br>
Publishing, New York, USA, 06-99, 29(1-2) (XP4167556) and "Coupled<br>
methathnol/hydrocarbon cracking (CMHC) - A new route to lower olefins from methanol" by<br>
S. Nowak et al, Chemical Industries (1992), 46,361-80, (XP8025670), although it is disclosed<br>
that coupled methanol hydrocarbon cracking was carried out using a zeolite catalyst that had<br>
been subjected to "dealumination by steam treatment (with subsequent acid leaching) to<br>
rearrange the extra-framework Al formed", there is no disclosure or suggestion in those<br>
documents of increasing the Si/Al ratio in the catalyst, as defined in the present specification,<br>
to be within the range of at least 180. In the present specification, as stated above, the term<br>
"silicon/alumimum atomic ratio" is intended to mean the Si/Al atomic ratio of the overall<br>
material, which may be determined by chemical analysis. In particular, for crystalline silicate<br>
materials, the stated Si/Al ratios apply not just to the Si/Al framework of the crystalline<br>
silicate but rather to the whole material. In the two prior papers, dealumination in the sense of<br>
removing framework aluminium is disclosed, but not increasing the Si/Al ratio of the whole<br>
material to within the range of at least 180.<br>
Instead of an MFI-type catalyst, the process of the invention may use an MEL-type crystalline<br>
silicate having a silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of from 150 to 800 which has been subjected<br>
to a steaming step, In accordance with this further aspect, an MEL catalyst for use in the<br>
catalytic hydrocarbon conversion process may be manufactured by steaming an as-synthesised <br>
or commercially available crystalline silicate. The MEL crystalline silicate catalyst for use in<br>
the invention most typically comprises a ZSM-11 catalyst which may be synthesised either<br>
using diammooctanc as the templating agent and sodium silicate as the silicon source or<br>
tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide as the 	 templating agent and a silica sol as the silicon source.<br><br>
Thus the ZSM-11 catalyst may be prepared by mixing sodium silicate with 1,8 diaminooctane<br>
together with aluminium sulphate to form a hydrogel which is then allowed to crystallise to<br>
form the crystalline silicate. The organic template material is men removed by calcining,<br>
Alternatively, the ZSM-11 catalyst is produced by reacting tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide<br>
and sodium hydroxide together with the silica sol prepared from colloidal silica. Again, a<br>
crystallisation is performed to produce the crystalline silicate and then the product is calcined<br>
In order to rednce the sodium content of me MEL crystalline silicate, the crystalline silicate is<br>
subjected to an ion exchange with a salt Thereafter the material is dried. Typically, the<br>
crystalline silicate is subjected to ion exchange with ammonium ions, for example by<br>
immersing the crystalline silicate in an aqueous solution ofNH4Cl or NH4NO3. Such an ion<br>
exchange step is desirable if the amount of sodium ions present in the crystalline silicate is so<br>
high that a crystalline sodium silicate phase is formed following calcination of the crystalline<br>
silicate which would be difficult to remove.<br>
The initial MEL crystalline silicate may be modified by a steaming process which, without<br>
being bound by theory, is believed to reduce the tetrahedral aluminium in the crystalline<br>
silicate framework and to convert the aluminium atoms into octahedral aluminum the form<br>
of amorphous alumina. Although in the steaming step aluminium atoms are chemically<br>
removed from the MEL crystalline silicate framework structure to form alumina particles,<br>
those particles appear not to migrate and so do not cause partial obstruction of the pores or<br>
channels in the framework which would otherwise inhibit the conversion processes of the<br>
present invention. The steaming step has been found to improve significantly the propylene<br>
yield, propylene selectivity and catalyst stability in the catalytic conversion process.<br>
The steam treatment on the MEL catalyst is conducted at elevated temperature, preferably in<br>
the range of from 425 to 870°C, more preferably in the range of from 540 to 815°C and at<br>
atmospheric pressure and at a water partial pressure of from 13 to 200kPa. Preferably, the<br>
steam treatment is conducted in an atmosphere comprising from 5 to 100% steam. The steam<br>
treatment is preferably carried out for a period of from 1 to 200 hours, more preferably from<br>
20 hours to 100 hours. As stated above, the steam treatment tends to reduce the amount of<br>
tetrahedral aluminium in the crystalline silicate framework, by forming alumina.<br><br>
Following the steaming step, the MEL catalyst is thereafter calcined, for example at a<br>
temperature of from 400 to 800°C at atmospheric pressure for a period of from 1 to 10 hours.<br>
Following the steaming step, the MEL catalyst may be contacted by a complexing agent for<br>
aluminium which may comprise an acid in an aqueous solution thereof or a salt of such an<br>
acid or a mixture of two or more such acids or salts. The complexing agent may in particular<br>
comprise an amine, such as ethyl diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or a salt thereof, in<br>
particular the sodium salt thereof. Following the contacting of the MEL crystalline silicate by<br>
the complexing agent, the crystalline silicate may be subjected to a second ion exchange step<br>
for reducing the sodium content of the crystalline silicate still further, for example by<br>
contacting the catalyst with an ammonium nitrate solution.<br>
The MEL or MFI crystalline silicate catalyst may be mixed with a binder, preferably an<br>
inorganic binder, and shaped to a desired shape, e.g. extruded pellets. The binder is selected<br>
so as to be resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the catalyst<br>
manufacturing process and in the subsequent catalytic conversion process. The binder is an<br>
inorganic material selected from clays, silica, metal oxides such as Zr02 and/or metals, or gels<br>
including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The binder is preferably alumina-free.<br>
However, aluminium in certain chemical compounds as in AlPO4's maybe used as the latter<br>
are quite inert and not acidic in nature. If the binder which is used in conjunction with the<br>
crystalline silicate is itself catalytically active, this may alter the conversion and/or the<br>
selectivity of the catalyst Inactive materials for the binder may suitably serve as diluents to<br>
control the amount of conversion so that products can be obtained economically and orderly<br>
without employing other means for controlling the reaction rate. It is desirable to provide a<br>
catalyst having a good crush strength. This is because in commercial use, it is desirable to<br>
prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder-like materials. Such clay or oxide<br>
binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of<br>
the catalyst. A particularly preferred binder for the catalyst of the present inventian comprises<br>
silica.<br>
The relative proportions of the finely divided crystalline silicate material and me inorganic<br>
oxide matrix of the binder can vary widely. Typically, the binder content of the composite<br><br>
catalyst ranges from 5 to 95% by weight, more typically from 20 to 50% by weight, based on<br>
me weight of me composite catalyst Such a mixture ofcrystalline silicate and an inorganic<br>
oxide binder is referred to as a formulated crystalline silicate.<br>
In mixing the catalyst with a binder, the catalyst may be formulated mtopeUets, extruded into<br>
other shape*, or formed into a spray-dried powder.<br>
Typically, the binder and the crystalline silicate catalyst are mixed together by an extrusion<br>
process. In such a process, the binder, for example silica, in the form of a gel is mixedwith<br>
the crystalline silicate catalyst material and the resultant mixture is extnided into the desired<br>
shape, for example pellets. Thereafter, the formulated crystalline silicate is calcined in air or<br>
an inert gas, typically at a temperature of from 200 to 900°C for a period of from 1 to 48<br>
houra.<br>
The binder preferably does not contain any aluminium compounds, such as alumina. This is<br>
because as mentioned above the preferred catalyst has a selected silicon/ahtminium ratio of<br>
the crystalline silicate. The presence of alumina in the binder yields other excess alumina if<br>
the binding step is performed prior to the aluminium extraction step. If the aluminium-<br>
containing binder is mixed with the crystalline silicate catalyst following »himiniiim<br>
extraction, mis re-aluminates the catalyst The presence of aluminium in the binder would<br>
tend to reduce the propylene selectivity of the catalyst, and to reduce the stability of the<br>
catalyst over time.<br>
In addition, the mixing of the catalyst with the binder may be carried out eithor before or after<br>
any steaming step.<br>
The various preferred catalysts have been found to exhibit high stability. This enables the<br>
catalytic conversion process to be performed continuously in two parallel "swing" reactors<br>
wherein when one reactor is operating, the other reactor is undergoing catalyst regeneration.<br>
The catalyst also can be regenerated several times. The catalyst is also flexible in that it can<br>
be employed to crack a variety of feedstocks, either pure or mixtures, coming from different<br>
sources in the oil refinery or petrochemical plant and having different compositions.<br><br>
In the catalytic conversion process, the process conditions are selected in order to provide high<br>
selectivity towards propylene, a stable conversion into propylene over time, and a stable<br>
product distribution in the effluent Such objectives are favoured by the use of a low acid<br>
density in the catalyst (i.e. a high Si/A1 atomic ratio) in conjunction with a low pressure, a<br>
high inlet temperature and a short contact time, all of which process parameters are<br>
interrelated and provide an overall cumulative effect (e.g. a higher pressure may be offset or<br>
compensated by a yet higher inlet temperature). The process conditions are selected to<br>
disfavour hydrogen transfer reactions leading to the formation of paraffins, aromatics and<br>
coke precursors. The process operating conditions thus employ a high space velocity, a low<br>
pressure and a high reaction temperature.<br>
The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) with respect to the cornpoeite hydrocarbon feedstock<br>
ranges from 0.5 to 30 h-1, preferably from 1 to 20 h-1, most preferably about 10 h-1. The<br>
composite hydrocarbon feedstock is preferably fed at a total inlet pressure suffident to convey<br>
the feedstock through the reactor. Preferably, the total absolute pressure in the reactorranges<br>
from 0.5 to 50 bars, more preferably from 5 to 45 bars. The partial pressure of the aliphatic<br>
hetero compound(s) may range from 10 to 400 kPa, preferably from 20 to 380 kPa, yet more<br>
preferably from 50 to 200 kPa. A particularly preferred aliphatic hetero compound partial<br>
pressure is 100 kPa. The olefin partial pressure may range from 10 to 200 kPa. Aparticularly<br>
preferred olefin partial pressure is 100 kPa (approximately atmospheric pressure). The outlet<br>
pressure is typically 1.5 bara.<br>
The weight ratio of the at least one C1 to C6 aliphatic hetero compound to the total<br>
hydrocarbons in the feedstock may be from 1 to 99 %, more preferably from 15 to 85 %, yet<br>
more preferably from 25 to 50 %.<br>
The weight ratio of the at least one C1 to C6 aliphatic hetero compound to the total unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbons in the feedstock may be from 0.05:1 to 20:1, more preferably from 0.25:1 to4:l,<br>
yet more preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1, most preferably from 0.75:1 to 1:1.<br>
The composite hydrocarbon feedstock may be fed undiluted or diluted with steam, e.g. from 0<br>
to 80 wt% steam, typically about 30 wt% steam, and/or in an inert gas, eg. nitrogen or<br><br>
hydrogen. The use of a low aliphatic hetero compound partial pressure, for example<br>
atmospheric pressure, tends to lower the incidence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the<br>
conversion process, which in turn reduces the potential for coke formation which tends to<br>
reduce catalyst stability. Preferably, the inlet temperature of the feedstock ranges from 350 to<br>
650°C, more preferably from 400 to 600°C, yet more preferably from 460 to 580°C, typically<br>
around 540 °C to 560°C.<br>
The catalytic conversion process can be performed in a fixed bed reactor, a moving bed<br>
reactor or a fluidized bed reactor. A typical fluid bed reactor is one ofthe FCC type used for<br>
fluidized-bed catalytic cracking in the oil refinery. A typical moving bed reactor is of the<br>
continuous catalytic reforming type. As described above, the process may be performed<br>
continuously using a pair of parallel "swing" fixed bed reactors.<br>
Since the catalyst exhibits high stability for an extended period, the frequency of regeneration<br>
of the catalyst is low. More particularly, the catalyst may accordingly have a lifetime which<br>
exceeds one year.<br>
The light fractions of the effluent, namely the C2 and C3 cuts, can contain more than 90%<br>
olefins (i.e. ethylene and propylene), typically more than 90% ethylene and propylene. Such<br>
cuts are sufficiently pure to constitute chemical grade olefin feedstocks. The propylene yield<br>
in such a process can range from 35 to 45%, the propylene yield being calculated on an "olefin<br>
+ CH2" basis, on the assumption that each methanol molecule constitutes a "CH2" source as<br>
for any olefin present in the feedstock. The propylene/ethylene weight ratio in a mixed C2/C3<br>
fraction typically ranges from 3:1 to 9:1, more typically from 4:1 to 7:1. The propylene of the<br>
C3 cut typically constitutes greater than 97wt%, more typiouly greater man 98wt% of the total<br>
C3 cut (propylene and propane).<br>
In accordance with the process of the present invention, by simultaneously converting olefinic<br>
streams and methanol into light olefins comprising ethylene and, preferentially, propylene, the<br>
heat balance ofknown catalytic conversion processes for converting hydrocarbon feedstocks<br>
into light olefins, in particular propylene, can be made more uniform, and m particular can be<br>
tuned to the particular reactor by selection of the composition of the total feedstock and the<br><br>
reactor conditions.<br>
In the presence of the crystalline silicate catalyst of the present invention, the cracking of the<br>
one or more olefins of C4 or greater into light olefins, in particular C2 and C3 olefins, most<br>
preferentially propylene, is an endothermic reaction. Therefore in prior olefin cracking<br>
processes, for example as disclosed in WO-A-99/29802, the heat balance needstobe carefully<br>
controlled to account for the endothermic nature of the olefin cracking process, hi contrast,<br>
the catalytic conversion, using the same catalyst, of the C1 to C6 aliphatic hetero compounds,<br>
employed in the process of the invention, in particular methanol, which is converted into<br>
olefins and water, is an exothermic reaction. Accordingly, since the present invention<br>
comprises passing a hydrocarbon feedstock, comprising a mixture of a first portion,<br>
containing one or more olefins of C4 or greater, and a second portion, containing at least one<br>
C1 to C6 aliphatic hetero compounds selected from alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds and<br>
mixtures thereof, through a reactor containing such a crystalline silicate catalyst, in order to<br>
produce an effluent containing light olefins, a thermal balance can be achieved between the<br>
simultaneously occurring exothermic and endothermic reactions. This provides operational<br>
advantages, in particular by permitting the reactor more readiry to be operated under adiabatic<br>
conditions.<br>
The present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following<br>
non-limiting Examples.<br>
Example1<br>
In Example 1, a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor had provided therein a crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst of the MFI-type. The catalyst comprised siticalite which had a silicon/alummium<br>
atomic ratio of 273 and had been produced by a de-alumination process as described<br>
hereinabove.<br>
More specifically, the silicalite catalyst was prepared by steaming 4.2 kg of silicalite at 550°C<br>
for a period of 48 hours with steam in a rotating laboratory furnace. Thereafter, 2 kg of the<br>
steamed silicalite was men treated with an aqueous solution of the sodium salt of ethyl<br><br>
diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA-Na2, there being 8.4 litres of a 0.055 molar solution thereof<br>
for the 2 kg of silicalite. The treatment was for a period of 18 hours at boiling temperature.<br>
The silicalite was then subsequently filtered and washed thoroughly with de-ionised water.<br>
This process extracted aluminium from the silicalite.<br>
Thereafter, an extruded catalyst was prepared using a kneader, in particular a Guittard type<br>
M5 No. 2295 kneader. m particular, 1640 g of the treated silicalite, 112 g of silica powder<br>
(Degussa FK500) aid 726 gofsilica sol (Nyacol 2040 from EKA containing about 41% silica<br>
by weight) were mixed for a few minutes to homogonize them, and then 600 ml of distilled<br>
water was added to the mixture to obtain a paste, which was then mixed for another 30<br>
minutes. After the 30 minute mixing time, 10 g of polyelectrolyte solution (Nalco 9779) were<br>
added to the mixture and kneaded for 1 minute. Then 30 g of methyl-hydroxy-ethyl-cellulose<br>
(Tylose from Hoechst MHB1000P2) were added. The loss on ignition (LOI) was about 33<br>
wt%. The extruder (Alexanderwerk type AGMR No. 04231162) was equipped with a the<br>
plate aperture of 2.5 mm, which was quadralobe shaped. The paste was passed 2 to 3 times<br>
through the extruder. The resultant extrudates were air-dried over night, then dried at 110°C<br>
for 16 hours in a drying oven with a heating rate of 60°C per hour, and then calcined at a<br>
temperature of 600°C for a period of 10 hours. Finally, the catalyst was subjected to ion-<br>
exchange, whereby 1740 g of the extruded catalyst was ion-exchanged using NH4Cl (0.5<br>
molar and 7310 ml of solution) twice, the first time being for a period of 18 hours and the<br>
second time being for a period of 3 hours, both at the boiling temperature of the solution.<br>
Finally, the catalyst was filtered off, washed and calcined at a temperature of 400°C for a<br>
period of 3 hours.<br>
The resultant modified silicalite catalyst was in the form of particles of crushed extrudates of<br>
35 to 45 mesh size. The surface area was 339 m2/gram and pore volume was 1.1 cm3/gram.<br>
The loss on ignition was 1.7 wt%. Chemical analysis of the catalyst indicate that the<br>
composition as SiO2 99.59 wt%, Al2O3 0.31 wt%, and Fe2O3 0.06 wt%. This provided a<br>
silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of 273. The silicalite content was 80 wt%.<br>
The laboratory scale reactor comprised a tube which had a diameter of 11 mm and a length of<br>
500 mm. The tube was loaded with a catalyst load of 10 ml (5.98 g). The top and bottom<br><br>
ends of the reactor tube were filled with ceramic inert granulates of 1.6 mm diameter. A<br>
thermocouple well was placed inside the reactor to measure the temperature profile in the<br>
catalyst bed.<br>
The reactor was heated up at a rate of 50°C per hour under nitrogen gas to an operating<br>
temperature of 560°C. The reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The reactor was fed with feedstock as set out in Table 1 (where MW means molecular weight,<br>
O means olefins, D means dienes,P means paraffins and A means aromatics). The composite<br>
feedstock included an olefin-containing C4+ fraction and a methanol fraction mixed together<br>
containing about 30 wt% methanol based on the total weight of the composite feedstock.The<br>
weight ratio of the methanol to the unsaturated hydrocarbons (olefins and dieses) in the<br>
feedstock was about 0.8:1.<br>
The LHSVofthe feedstock was 10 h-1. The flow rate of -CH2, in both the olefin-containing<br>
portion and the methanol, was 72 grams/hour. The reactor inlet temperature was adjusted to<br>
560°C. The outlet pressure was set at 1.5 bars (150 kPa). The time or stream (TOS) was<br>
under 30 hours. The composition of the effluent was analysed on-line using an<br>
chromatograph equipment, having a microbore column of 40 m from Agilent Technologies.<br>
A second chromatographic analysis was earned out due to the correlation between isobutene<br>
and 1-butene having a Porap lot U column ina micro gas chromatograph (Micro G C) from<br>
Agilent Technologies.<br>
After the feedstock flow was terminated following the selected time on stream, the reactor<br>
tube was purged with nitrogen and cooled down to 300°C. The catalyst was then regenerated<br>
using the sequence of steps shown in Table 2. Any reactor coke was burned of under<br>
controlled temperatures and under controlled flow rates of nitrogen and air, in particular by<br>
limiting the amount of oxygen (0.6 wt%) to control the exotherm of the carbon oxygenation<br>
reaction. Subsequently, the reactor was purged with nitrogen for a subsequent cycle. This<br>
regeneration procedure allows full recovery of the activity, selectivity and stability of the<br>
catalyst<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between the ethylene yield (in weight percent) and the<br>
propylene yield (in weight percent), verses time on stream(TOS) for Example 1. The olefins<br>
yield in Figure 1 is on an olefin basis.<br>
In order to take into account of the contribution of methanol in Example 1 to the conversion<br>
into ethylene and propylene, the yield of both ethylene and propylene was normalised so as to<br>
be on an "olefin 4- CH2" basis, on the assumption that each methanol molecule constitutes a<br>
"CH2" source as tor any olefin present in the feedstock. Figure 2 shows the relationship<br>
between the normalised yield on an olefin + CH2 basis with respect to the time on stream.<br>
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the propylene/ethylene yield ratio with respect to the<br>
time on stream.<br>
It may be seen from Figures 1,2 and 3 that the propylene/ethylnene yield rario is initially about<br>
3 and increases to a value of greater than 5 with increasing time on stream, up to about 25<br>
hours.<br>
It should be noted that the methanol in the feedstock was fully converted and no methanol or<br>
dimethylether (DME) was detected in the effluent, even at the end of a cycle. The gas<br>
chromatography results employed to derive the data for Figures 1 to 3 were converted to<br>
obtain the olefin yield taking into account that water was not detected in the effluent, using a<br>
flame ionization detector.<br>
Figure 4 shows the relationship between the composition of the Ca and C3 fractions in the<br>
effluent versus time on stream. The C2 fraction shows the proportion, by weight, of ethylene<br>
to total C2's and the proportion, by weight, of propylene to total C3's for the C2 and C3<br>
fractions respectively.<br>
Example 2<br>
m Example 2 the process of Example 1 was repeated with the same feedstock, catalyst flow<br>
rate and LHSV but at a lower reactor inlet temperature of 540°C. The corresponding results<br><br>
are also shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
Comrative Example 1.<br>
In this Comparative Example, Example 1 was repeated using the same catalyst but a different<br>
feedstock that did not containmethanol, and had the hydrocarbon composition shown in Table<br>
3. This feedstock was the same as fhsi of the olefin-containg fraction employed to produce<br>
the composite feedstock of Examples 1 and 2, but did not include the 30wt% addition<br>
methanol. The olefin content of the feedstock was correspondingly higher than that of the<br>
olefin-conuuning portion of the composite feedstock additionally including a methanol<br>
portion, used in Examples 1 and 2. The CH2 flow rate was 60 g/h, aai the LHSV was as in<br>
Example 1. The reactor temperature was 560°C. The corresponding results are also shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 4.<br>
A comparison of fee results, illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 for Examples 1 and 2 and<br>
Comparative Example 1, shows that by replacing a proportion, in fee Examples 30 wt%, of an<br>
olefin-containing hydrocarbon feed, containing about 50 wt% olefins, wife methanol can give<br>
rise to a slight increase in propylene yield at the same inlet temperature. However, as also<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2, the additional of methanol to fee olcfin-containing feedstock<br>
reduces fee ethylene yield quite significantly, particularly after about 10 hours on stream.<br>
Also, if fee inlet temperature is decreased, in fee Examples from S60°C to 540°C, when<br>
methanol is added to fee olefm-containing portion, the ethylene and propylene yields are<br>
correspondingly decreased, but fee propylene yield at 540°C remains at substantially the same<br>
level as the propylene yield for the olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock without methanol<br>
at a higher inlet temperature of 560°C.<br>
From Figure 2 it may be seen feat for the normalised yield on an "olefin + CH2" basis, fee<br>
relationship between ethylene and propylene yield are substantially the same as shown in<br>
Figure 1. Comparing Example 1 with Comparative Example 1, which were conducted at fee<br>
same reactor inlet temperature, the presence of methanol has a slight positive impact on the<br>
propylene yield, and lowers the ethylene yield.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows that whether the reactor inlet temperature is the same (Example 1), or lower<br>
(Example 2), the propylene/ethylene yield ratio is increased by adding methanol to an olefin-<br>
containing hydrocarbon feedstock- This is because of reduced ethylene production as aresuh<br>
of the addition of methanol. Furthermore, the propylene/ethylene ratio tends progressively to<br>
increase with time on stream, due to progressive reduction in the etiiylene production with<br>
increasing time on stream when methanol has been added to the olefin-containing<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock. Furthermore, if the reactor inlet temperature is decreased together<br>
with addition of methanol to the olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock, the<br>
propylene/ethylene yield ratio tends to be increased.<br>
hi Figure 4, it may be seen that the presence of methanol in the hydrocarbon feedstock tends<br>
to enhance the selectivity towards olefins for both the C2 and C3 fractions. This means that for<br>
the C3 cut, the propylene purity is improved, and for the C2 cut the ethylene purity is<br>
improved.<br>
In summary therefore, the Examples and Comparative Examples demonstrate that olefinic<br>
streams and methanol can be simultaneously converted into light olefins. The use of methanol<br>
co-injection gives rise to slightly higher propylene yields, at the same reactor inlet<br>
temperature. More importantly, a higher propylene/edrylene yield ratio can be achieved by<br>
methanol co-injection and furthermore, the olefin contents in the light C2 and C3 cuts can be<br>
significantly improved.<br>
Figure 5 shows the relationship between temperature and position in the reactor in<br>
Comparative Example 1, with there being a plurality of plots, each taken at a specific time an<br>
stream, from the beginning to the end of the conversion process (the final time on stream<br>
being about 115 hours). The curves progressively move as shown in Figure 5 between the<br>
beginning of the time on stream to the end of the time on stream. Even though in<br>
Comparative Example 1 the reactor was not operated in adiabatic mode, it may clearly be seen<br>
that the hydrocarbon feedstock, which was introduced at 560°C, entered the top of the catalyst<br>
bed, but the temperature at the top of the catalyst bed decreased abruptly as soon as the olefin<br>
cracking reaction occurred at the top of the catalyst bed. The amplitude of the "negative"<br>
temperature peak was deepest at the beginning of the time on stream, and decreased<br><br>
progressively at the catalyst tended progressively to deactivate. However, the minimum<br>
temperature value for each plot remained substantially at the same position with increasing<br>
time on stream. This clearly shows that the olefinic catalytic conversion is endothermic, and<br>
leads to a thermal imbalance in the reactor.<br>
In contrast, Figure 6 shows a similar relationship between temperature and position in the<br>
reactor, but for Example 1, where the reactor inlet temperature was the same at 560°C as for<br>
Comparative Example 1, but the hydrocarbon feedstock included methanol as well as the one<br>
or more olefins of C4 or greater. Again, a plurality of plots are shown varying with time on<br>
stream, and ranging from the beginning of the time on stream to the end of the time on stream,<br>
at about 29 hours. It may be seen from Figure 6 that the temperature increased sharply at the<br>
top of the catalytic bed, which indicates that the methanol reacted first as the composite<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock entered the reactor. The methanol conversion reaction is exothermic,<br>
which caused the increase in temperature. With increasing time on stream leading to<br>
progressive deactivation of the catalyst, the temperature peak decreased and was displaced<br>
from the top of the catalyst bed at least partially towards the end of the catalyst bed.<br>
Comparing Figures 5 and 6, it will be seen that for typical operational times on stream of more<br>
than 10 hours, the temerature profile in the catalyst bed is more uniform, indicating a greater<br>
degree ofheat balance between the competing exothermic and endothermic reactions, for the<br>
process of the invention, as compared to the Comparative Example where only an<br>
endothermic reaction of olefin catalytic conversion occurs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
