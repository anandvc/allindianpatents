				<td>OZONE CLEANING SYSTEM<br>
Field of Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a system of providing an aqueous solution of<br>
ozone for industrial cleaning applications. The present invention relates to a reaction vessel for<br>
entraining ozone gas in an aqueous solution of ozone for industrial cleaning applications. The<br>
present invention relates to a method of producing an ozone solution and a composition of an<br>
ozone solution.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
[0002] Ozone in a solution has been previously used for cleaning and sanitizing.<br>
Maintaining a solution with a consistent ozone concentration has proven difficult. Ozone is<br>
unstable, which provides for it cleaning and sanitizing capabilities, but also makes consistent<br>
ozone levels difficult to maintain in a solution. If the ozone solution has too much ozone or<br>
large bubbles of ozone, then off-gassing problems may occur, as the excess ozone is released<br>
into the work facility creating environmental problems and possible violating workplace safety<br>
regulations. If the solution has too little ozone, then the cleaning and sterilizing may not be as<br>
effective as desired.<br>
[0003] Other systems utilize a spraying device that simultaneously sprays two<br>
separate streams of water and an ozone solution. The stream of water is applied at high pressure<br>
for removing particles and the ozone solution is applied for sanitizing.<br>
[0004] Ozone solutions have proven difficult to consistently and uniformly prepare<br>
in sufficient quantities required for industrial cleaning applications.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
[0005] The system produces an aqueous ozone solution to attack and destroy<br>
pathogens and to act as a no-rinse sanitizer for hard surfaces in a variety of applications,<br>
especially for industrial cleaning applications in facilities related to food processing. The system<br>
includes a reaction vessel that entrains ozone gas in an aqueous ozone solution. Methods of<br>
making aqueous ozone solutions for industrial cleaning systems are described. Compositions for<br>
aqueous ozone solutions for use with industrial cleaning systems are also described.<br>
[0006] The system, the reaction vessel, the aqueous ozone solution may be used for<br>
many different sanitation applications in many different industries and facilities. For example,<br>
the system, reaction vessel, and aqueous ozone solution may be used in cosmetic manufacturing<br>
facilities, hospitals, fast food outlets, individual homes, etc. The system, reaction vessel, and the<br>
aqueous ozone solution may be used with a variety of different "clean in place" systems, such as,<br>
for example, water-bottling facilities and equipment, breweries and brewing equipment, ethanol<br>
processing facilities, water-bottling facilities and equipment, snack food processing facilities,<br>
cooling towers etc. The use of the system, the reaction vessel, and the aqueous ozone solution is<br>
not limited to any particular type of industry or application type.<br>
[0007] The reaction vessel includes a conical-shaped surface having a plurality of<br>
edges or ridges. The conical-shaped surface defines a generally hollow interior, and the plurality<br>
of edges or ridges are in contact with the generally hollow interior. An inlet port is in fluidic<br>
communication with a supply of an aqueous ozone solution to supply the aqueous ozone solution<br>
to the conical-shaped surface. Nozzles are in fluidic communication with a supply of water, and<br>
the nozzles direct the water under pressure at the conical-shaped surface, and the water mixes<br>
with the aqueous ozone solution from the inlet port. An outlet is in fluidic communication with<br>
the industrial cleaning system. The reaction vessel may receive the aqueous ozone solution from<br>
an injector. The reaction vessel reduces the number and size of bubbles of ozone gas in the<br>
aqueous ozone solution and entrains the bubbles of ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution to<br>
increase the oxidation reduction potential of the aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0008] The system comprises an ozone generator for producing ozone gas. The<br>
ozone generator directs the ozone gas to the injector, which is also in communication with the<br>
supply of water. The injector injects ozone gas from the ozone generator into the water from the<br>
supply of water to form the aqueous ozone solution. The reaction vessel receives the aqueous<br>
ozone solution from the injector and additional water from the water supply. A pump in<br>
communication with the reaction vessel distributes the aqueous ozone solution to the hard<br>
surfaces for cleaning the hard surfaces.<br>
[0009] The system and the reaction vessel reduces the amount of bubbles and the<br>
bubble size of the ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution, which allows for the system and<br>
reaction vessel to produce an aqueous ozone solution with a greater concentration of ozone gas<br>
and a higher oxidation reduction potential. Since the bubbles of ozone are smaller and fewer<br>
than the bubbles of ozone in a typical ozone solution, the system and reaction vessel allows the<br>
aqueous ozone solution to contain a greater amount of ozone and have the higher oxidation<br>
reduction potential. This provides for a more effective cleaning and sanitizing system.<br>
[0010] The reaction vessel may be used with a variety of industrial cleaning systems.<br>
In the system described herein, the system entrains ozone gas into water, forming the aqueous<br>
ozone solution and delivers the aqueous ozone solution to the reaction vessel for further<br>
entraining and concentrating of the ozone gas into the aqueous ozone solution. The system<br>
provides an applied dosage of an aqueous ozone solution that is consistent over time in terms of<br>
concentration and flow rate.<br>
[0011] The aqueous ozone solutions serve as a cleaning and sterilizing agent.<br>
Systems for making and applying the aqueous ozone solutions are also described. In one<br>
embodiment, the method of making the aqueous ozone solution for the industrial cleaning system<br>
includes providing the reaction vessel for entraining the ozone gas in the aqueous solution. The<br>
reaction vessel includes the conical-shaped surface having the plurality of edges or ridges. The<br>
conical-shaped surface defines the generally hollow interior, and the plurality of edges or ridges<br>
are in contact with the interior. The reaction vessel is in fluidic communication with the supply<br>
of water. The reaction vessel is also in fluidic communication with a supply of a first aqueous<br>
ozone solution. The first aqueous ozone solution is directed to the conical-shaped surface.<br>
Water is directed to the conical-shaped surface, and the water and the first aqueous ozone<br>
solution are mixed to form a second aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment of the composition, the aqueous ozone solution comprises<br>
approximately 1 part by volume water mixed with approximately 4 parts by volume to<br>
approximately 9 parts by volume of the first aqueous ozone solution to form the second aqueous<br>
ozone solution that has an oxidation reaction potential of up to approximately 2.6, wherein the<br>
second aqueous ozone solution has an ozone concentration of up to approximately 20 ppm,<br>
wherein the second ozone solution has less ozone gas bubbles than the first aqueous ozone<br>
solution.<br>
[0013] The first aqueous ozone solution is mixed with water in the reaction vessel to<br>
form the second aqueous ozone solution. The reaction vessel reduces the bubbles of ozone gas<br>
in the first aqueous ozone solution and entrains the remaining bubbles of ozone gas in the second<br>
aqueous ozone solution to increase the oxidation reduction potential of the second aqueous ozone<br>
solution. The reaction vessel reduces the amount of bubbles and the bubble size of the ozone gas<br>
in the first and second aqueous ozone solutions, which allows for the system to produce the<br>
second aqueous ozone solution with a greater concentration of ozone gas and a higher oxidation<br>
reduction potential.<br>
[0014] In the methods described herein for forming the aqueous ozone solution,<br>
ozone gas is entrained into water, forming the first aqueous ozone solution, which is delivered to<br>
the to the reaction vessel for further entraining and concentrating of the ozone gas into the<br>
aqueous ozone solution. The water is mixed with the first aqueous ozone solution to form the<br>
second aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0015] In the methods described herein for forming the aqueous ozone solution, the<br>
ozone generator produces the ozone gas. The ozone generator directs the ozone gas to the<br>
injector, which is also in communication with the supply of water. The injector injects ozone gas<br>
from the ozone generator into the water from the supply of water to form the first aqueous ozone<br>
solution. The reaction vessel receives the first aqueous ozone solution from the injector and<br>
additional water from the water supply. The reaction vessel comprises the conical-shaped vessel<br>
having the plurality of edges or ridges for reducing a bubble size of the ozone gas in the first<br>
aqueous ozone solution and for mixing the water with the first aqueous ozone solution to form<br>
the second aqueous ozone solution. The pump in communication with the reaction vessel<br>
distributes the second aqueous ozone solution to the hard surfaces for cleaning the hard surfaces.<br>
[0016] The hard surfaces may include, for example, conveyor systems, processing<br>
equipment, floors, tables, etc. The solution of aqueous ozone may be applied at a high pressure<br>
to the hard surfaces, and is effective for sanitizing the hard surfaces and removing soils and bulk<br>
materials from the hard surfaces. When applied at high pressure, the solution penetrates and<br>
destroys the soils and oxides of a biofilm that acts as the bond or glue that allows the soils and<br>
oxides to attach themselves to the hard surfaces.<br>
[0017] The methods and solution may be used in the system described herein. The<br>
system is a chemical-free system that destroys the biofilm on hard surfaces during food<br>
processing production in food processing facilities. The system allows for continuous or<br>
extended production in the facility. When installed in processing facilities, the hard surfaces can<br>
be maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week accomplishing both a microbial reduction as well as<br>
improving aesthetics. The system allows the plant to do mid-shift sanitation or a cleaning<br>
application that the plant could not do with present conventional systems (because ozone is<br>
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for direct food contact and chemicals are not).<br>
[0018] The system provides a chemical-free, high pressure cleaning system that<br>
replaces present conventional cleaning systems. The system reduces the need for chemicals, hot<br>
water, and labor. As such, the processors operating costs may be reduced by 50%. Conventional<br>
cleaning systems often require the use of warm or hot water, which may form condensation on<br>
the hard surfaces. The condensation may provide for or encourage the growth of microbes.<br>
Because the system only uses cold water, condensation is not likely to form on the hard surfaces.<br>
The system also reduces the hydraulic load on the waste-water treatment system and eliminates<br>
the need to treat the chemicals that would be present in conventional wastewater discharge<br>
streams.<br>
[0019] Ozone gas is generally unstable (a property that gives ozone its extraordinary<br>
oxidizing capabilities). Ozone gas cannot be packaged or stored and must be generated on site.<br>
The system includes an on-site ozone generator combined with an air preparation unit and an<br>
injector to safely get the ozone into the water. As such, the system requires no drums to store<br>
ozone, records and reports relating to the drums, or disposal concerns relating to the drums.<br>
[0020] The use of ozone as cleaning and sterilizing agent is a chemical treatment like<br>
other oxidizers, including chlorine, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, etc. Ozone's<br>
extraordinary speed and power sets ozone apart from the other oxidizers, but there are rules to be<br>
followed in its application. Stoichiometric (chemical value) calculation charts and formulas are<br>
readily available for all common inorganic contaminants, including but not limited to, iron,<br>
manganese, sulfide compounds. Simple formulas for flow and contaminant loading make ozone<br>
generator sizing easy. With contact times in the 2-6 minute range for common contaminants,<br>
instead of the 20-30 minute times associated with chlorination, the system described herein is<br>
simpler, more compact and efficient than traditional cleaning treatments.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0027] An ozone system 10 for applying an aqueous solution of ozone will now be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying Figures. The system 10 provides many<br>
advantages over the prior art. The system 10 provides a centralized system for producing an<br>
aqueous ozone solution, i.e., the aqueous ozone solution is prepared and distributed from a<br>
central location in an industrial facility to different application points throughout the industrial<br>
facility. The system 10 provides for the distribution of the aqueous ozone solution at different<br>
flow rates and at different concentrations to the different application points. The system 10<br>
monitors and maintains the ozone concentration and flow rate of the aqueous ozone solution at<br>
desired levels. The system 10 provides a uniform and consistent aqueous ozone solution without<br>
off-gassing problems. Fluctuations in the concentration of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution<br>
are kept to a minimum with the aid of monitoring systems that monitor the concentration of<br>
ozone in the aqueous ozone solution and modulate levels of ozone gas introduced into the<br>
aqueous ozone solution. The system 10 increases the oxidation reaction potential of a<br>
conventional aqueous ozone solution by reducing the bubble size of ozone gas and minimizing<br>
the amount of bubbles of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0028] A process flow diagram for the system 10 is shown in Figure 1. A control<br>
panel/central server 50 comprising a programmable logic controller and user interface is in<br>
electrical communication with the components of the system 10 to operate, monitor, and direct<br>
the system 10. The control panel/central server 50 regulates the concentration of ozone in the<br>
ozonated water solution and the flow of ozonated water solution. The control panel/central<br>
server 50 is in electrical communication with the various components, systems and assemblies of<br>
the system 10 to ensure that the desired flow and concentration of the ozonated water solution<br>
are maintained. The control panel/central server 50 regulates the flow and amount of ozone gas<br>
that is entrained in the solution. The system 10 produces high pressure and high volumes of the<br>
ozonated water solution to clean and sanitize industrial facilities. The system 10 may be scaled<br>
depending upon its application, for example, the system 10 may provide lower volumes, e.g., 1<br>
gallon per minute and higher volumes, e.g. 10,000 gallons per minute.<br>
[0029] A reaction vessel 350 is incorporated in the system 10. The reaction vessel<br>
350 entrains ozone gas in an aqueous solution of ozone. Figure 2 shows a sectional view of the<br>
reaction vessel 350. The reaction vessel 350 reduces the bubble size of the ozone gas in the<br>
aqueous ozone solution and the number of bubbles in the aqueous ozone solution. The reaction<br>
vessel 350 increases the concentration of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution as well as its<br>
oxidation reduction potential to improve the cleaning and sanitizing capabilities of the aqueous<br>
ozone solution. Decreasing the bubble size of the ozone gas also assists in maintaining a<br>
uniform concentration of ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution and reducing off-gassing.<br>
[0030] In the reaction vessel 350, fresh water and an aqueous ozone solution mix.<br>
The reaction vessel 350 circulates the fresh water and forms a vortex, which mixes with the<br>
aqueous ozone solution. The mixing in the reaction vessel 350 breaks the ozone gas in the<br>
aqueous ozone solution into smaller and smaller bubbles, which exit the reaction vessel 350 in<br>
the aqueous ozone solution. In reaction vessel 350, the aqueous ozone solution is forced into a<br>
saturated aqueous ozone solution having an ozone concentration of up to approximately 20 ppm<br>
and an oxidation reaction potential of up to approximately 2.6. Off-gassing of ozone gas is<br>
reduced by the reaction vessel 350.<br>
[0031] The reaction vessel 350 is in fluidic communication with a supply of the<br>
aqueous ozone solution, e.g., a venturi 310, in which an aqueous ozone solution is formed by<br>
injection of ozone gas into water in the venturi 310. The reaction vessel 350 is also in fluidic<br>
communication with a supply of water 330 for mixing with the aqueous ozone solution. After<br>
the mixing in the reaction vessel 350, the reaction vessel 350 outputs the aqueous ozone solution<br>
to a contact tank 405.<br>
[0032] The reaction vessel 350 comprises a conical-shaped surface 385 having a<br>
plurality of edges 380 or ridges 382 on the conical-shaped surface 385. The conical-shaped<br>
surface 385 imparts a rotating action or a vortex to the water entering the reaction vessel 350<br>
from the supply of water 330, and the water rotates about the conical-shaped surface 385 toward<br>
the aqueous ozone solution entering the reaction vessel 350, which crushes ozone gas bubbles in<br>
the aqueous ozone water solution.<br>
[0033] The reaction vessel 350 is shown illustrated for use with an exemplary<br>
system 10 in Figures 1 and 3-5. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the reaction<br>
vessel 350 may be used with other industrial cleaning systems that use an aqueous solution of<br>
ozone.<br>
[0034] The methods of forming the aqueous ozone solution will now be described.<br>
The methods described herein reduce the bubble size of ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution<br>
and the number of bubbles in the aqueous ozone solution. The methods increases the<br>
concentration of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution as well as its oxidation reduction potential<br>
to improve the cleaning and sanitizing capabilities of the aqueous ozone solution. The<br>
compositions of aqueous ozone solution described herein have less bubbles and smaller bubbles<br>
of ozone gas than conventional solutions. Decreasing the bubble size of the ozone gas also<br>
assists in maintaining a uniform concentration of ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution and<br>
reducing off-gassing. The compositions of aqueous ozone solution provide for cleaning and<br>
sanitizing of industrial facilities.<br>
[0035] Fresh water and a first aqueous ozone solution are mixed to form a second<br>
aqueous ozone solution. The reaction vessel 350 circulates the fresh water and forms a vortex,<br>
which mixes with the first aqueous ozone solution with the water. The mixing in the reaction<br>
vessel 350 of the water and the first aqueous ozone solution breaks the ozone gas bubbles in the<br>
first aqueous ozone solution into smaller and smaller bubbles and forms the second aqueous<br>
ozone solution that exits the reaction vessel 350. In reaction vessel 350, the first aqueous ozone<br>
solution is forced into a saturated aqueous ozone solution having an ozone concentration of up to<br>
approximately 20 ppm and an oxidation reaction potential of up to approximately 2.6. Off-<br>
gassing of ozone gas is reduced by the reaction vessel 350, as many of the gas bubbles in the first<br>
aqueous ozone solution are crushed.<br>
[0036] The reaction vessel 350 is in fluidic communication with a supply of the first<br>
aqueous ozone solution, e.g., the venturi 310. The reaction vessel 350 is also in fluidic<br>
communication with the supply of water 330 for mixing with the first aqueous ozone solution.<br>
After the mixing in the reaction vessel 350, the reaction vessel 350 outputs the second aqueous<br>
ozone solution to a contact tank 405. The reaction vessel and its conical-shaped surface 385<br>
imparts a rotating action or a vortex to the water entering the reaction vessel 350 from the supply<br>
of water 330, and the water rotates about the conical-shaped surface 385 toward the first aqueous<br>
ozone solution entering the reaction vessel 350, which crushes ozone gas bubbles in the first<br>
aqueous ozone water solution.<br>
[0037] The preparation of the ozone gas will now be described.<br>
[0038] The ozone gas for use with the system 10 is produced from ambient air. An<br>
important feature of the system 10 is that it ensures that a consistent supply of dried air is<br>
delivered to oxygen concentrators 160, which produce essentially pure oxygen gas for ozone<br>
generation in ozone generators 240, such that the system 10 provides a sufficient quantity of<br>
ozone gas with consistent quality. The consistent supply of dried air ultimately assists in<br>
creating the consistent supply of the aqueous ozonated solution produced by the system 10.<br>
[0039] The system 10 draws in the ambient air to a compressed dry air supply skid<br>
100 (shown in Figure 3) comprising an air compressor 120, a dryer 140, a dew point monitor<br>
150, the oxygen concentrators 160, and an oxygen storage tank 180. The air compressor 120 is<br>
in communication with the dryer 140. The air compressor 120 compresses the ambient air and<br>
delivers the compressed air to the dryer 140. The compressed air is dried in the dryer 140. The<br>
dryer 140 is in communication with the dew point monitor 150, which measures the dew point of<br>
air exiting the dryer 140. A suitable dew point monitor 150 is commercially available from<br>
Vaisala Instruments.<br>
[0040] From the dew point monitor 150, the compressed and dried air passes to the<br>
oxygen concentrators 160, which produce essentially pure oxygen gas from the dried and<br>
compressed air that is stored in the oxygen storage tank 180. The oxygen storage tank 180 acts<br>
as a storage and supply reservoir of oxygen for ozone generation. Excess oxygen is stored in the<br>
oxygen storage tank.<br>
[0041] Maintaining a high concentration of oxygen in the oxygen gas assists in<br>
creating the consistent supply of the aqueous ozonated solution produced by the system 10.<br>
Generally, the essentially pure oxygen gas will contain over 90% pure oxygen, with a preferred<br>
range of approximately 95% to 98% pure oxygen. The oxygen concentrators 160 may use a<br>
pressure swing adsorption process using a molecular sieve. A suitable oxygen concentrator 160<br>
is commercially available from the AirSep Corporation. The compressed dry air supply skid 100<br>
may further include one or more filters 132 for oil and contaminant removal, one or more<br>
pressure indicators 134 for monitoring the pressures of the compressed air and the stored oxygen<br>
gas in the oxygen storage tank 180, and one or more pressure relief valves 136 for discharging<br>
pressurized gas. A flow controller 138 modulates the flow of oxygen gas from the oxygen<br>
concentrators 160 to the oxygen storage tank 180, while one of the pressure indicators 134 and<br>
one of the pressure relief valves 136 is also employed to monitor and provide pressure relief for<br>
the oxygen gas directed to the oxygen storage tank 180 from the oxygen concentrators 160.<br>
[0042] The essentially pure oxygen gas is delivered to an ozone generation skid 200<br>
(shown in Figure 4) comprising the ozone generator 240, an ozone destruct unit 260, a<br>
distribution manifold 270, and one or more mass flow controllers 305. The ozone generation<br>
skid produces ozone and directs it via the distribution manifold 270 and the one or more mass<br>
flow controllers 305 to one or more mixing skids 300 (shown in Figure 5).<br>
[0043] The ozone generator 240 produces ozone gas from the essentially pure oxygen<br>
gas. The ozone generator 240 is in communication with the oxygen storage tank 180. The ozone<br>
generator 240 is configured with a cooling system, such as a cool-water recirculation jacket 243,<br>
to maintain the ozone generator 240 at under approximately 100° F. The ozone generator may<br>
utilize a corona discharge method of ozone generation. Maintaining a cool temperature is<br>
preferred to regulate ozone concentration, as higher concentrations of ozone gas are achieved<br>
from the ozone generator 240 when the temperature of the ozone generator 240 is maintained at<br>
these cool levels. The ozone destruct unit 260 receives excess ozone or ozone that has separated<br>
from the aqueous ozone solution in other parts of the system 10 for destruction.<br>
[0044] As shown in Figure 4, the ozone generation skid 200 comprises one or more<br>
ozone generators 240. Some of the one or more ozone generators may only be used in a backup<br>
capacity, i.e., when one of the previously operational ozone generators 240 require maintenance<br>
or breaks-down. As such, the industrial facility will not need to shut down for a conventional<br>
cleaning process when one of the ozone generators 240 is non-operational. Depending on the<br>
overall size of the system 10, up to 30 or more ozone generators 240 may be included in the<br>
ozone generation skid 200. The ozone generators 240 are in electrical communication with the<br>
control panel/central server 50 in order to monitor and control their operation.<br>
[0045] The ozone generation skid 200 includes the distribution manifold 270 and the<br>
mass flow controllers 305 for disseminating the ozone gas to the one or more mixing skids 300<br>
for mixing with water to produce the aqueous ozone solution. The distribution manifold 270 is<br>
in communication with the ozone generators 240. An isolation valve 242, an air actuated ball<br>
valve 244, and a back flow preventer 246 are positioned between the ozone generator 240 and<br>
the distribution manifold 270 to direct the flow of ozone gas from the ozone generator 240 to the<br>
distribution manifold 270.<br>
[0046] The mass flow controllers 305 are in electrical communication with the<br>
control panel/central server 50 for modulating the flow of the ozone gas. A suitable mass flow<br>
controller 305 is commercially available from Eldrige, Products, Inc.<br>
[0047] Typically, the distribution manifold 270 will branch into separate lines each<br>
having a mass flow controller 305a-g in communication with each of the one or more mixing<br>
skids 300a-g. Additional isolation valves 242 are configured between the mass flow controllers<br>
305a-g and the distribution manifold 270. The number of mixing skids 300a-g and mass flow<br>
controllers 305a-g will depend upon the application requirements of the system 10. For<br>
example, certain industrial facilities may only require two to four mixing skids 300a-g and mass<br>
flow controllers 305a-g, while other industrial facilities may require six to eight mixing skids<br>
300a-g and mass flow controllers 305a-g. The distribution manifold 270 further directs ozone gas<br>
to an auxiliary use, such as a deodorizer, or to the ozone destruction unit 260.<br>
[0048] As shown in Figure 5, the one or more mixing skids 300 comprise the venturi<br>
310, the reaction vessel 350, the contact tank 405, a degassing separator 420, a demister 440, a<br>
mixing ozone monitor 460, and a pump 480. At the mixing skids 300, water from the water<br>
supply 330 and ozone gas from the ozone generation skid 200 are directed via lines, hoses,<br>
and/or piping to the venturi 310 for forming an aqueous ozone solution. The venturi 310 acts as<br>
an injector, i.e., it injects the ozone gas into the water. A preferred injector is commercially<br>
available from the Mazzei Injector Corporation; however, any of a variety of injectors could be<br>
utilized in the one or more mixing skids 300.<br>
[0049] As previously noted, before reaching the venturi 310, the ozone gas passes<br>
through the one or more mass flow controllers 305a-g, which measures the flow of ozone to the<br>
venturi 310 and modulates the flow of ozone to the venturi 310. The mass flow controllers 305a-<br>
g are in electrical communication with the control panel/central server 50 in order regulate and<br>
control the flow of ozone gas through the mass flow controllers 305a-g. The operator of the<br>
system may adjust the flow of ozone to the venturi 310 to obtain the desired ozone<br>
concentrations level in the aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0050] Although an aqueous ozone solution has now been formed by the venturi 310,<br>
the aqueous ozone solution is now directed to the reaction vessel 350 for further processing to<br>
reduce the bubble size of the ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution and number of bubbles and<br>
to increase the concentration of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution as well as its oxidation<br>
reduction potential. Decreasing the bubble size of the ozone gas also assists in maintaining a<br>
uniform concentration of ozone gas in the aqueous ozone solution. A supply of water is in<br>
communication with the reaction vessel 350. The supply of water directs water to a conical-<br>
shaped surface of the reaction vessel 350, and the water mixes with the aqueous ozone solution<br>
to form the second aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0051] The operation and structure of the reaction vessel 350 will now be described<br>
in detail with reference to Figure 2. The aqueous ozone solution from the venturi 310 is<br>
discharged into the bottom of reaction vessel 350 at an inlet port 355. The aqueous ozone<br>
solution travels up an inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 in the interior of the reaction vessel 350.<br>
[0052] Nozzles 360 discharge a stream of fresh water, at approximately 50 to 55 psi,<br>
at the top of the reaction vessel 350 into the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370. The water from<br>
the nozzles 360 dilutes the aqueous ozone solution from the venturi 310. The nozzles 360 receive<br>
the fresh water from the water supply 330 through a fresh water inlet 345 and a regulator 348.<br>
The regulator 348 is in electrical communication with the control panel/central server 50. The<br>
regulator 348 provides pressure readings to the control panel/central server 50, and the regulator<br>
348 modulates the pressure and flow of fresh water into the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 at<br>
the direction of the control panel/central server 50. The pressure in the inner vortex assembly<br>
sleeve 370 is varied to accommodate the desired flow rate of the aqueous ozonated water<br>
solution from the particular mixing skid 300 a-g. If the pressure in the inner vortex assembly<br>
sleeve 370 is too high, then off-gassing problems of ozone gas may occur.<br>
[0053] The inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 is shown in Figure 2. The inner vortex<br>
assembly sleeve 370 is under a pressure of approximately 50 psi to approximately 125 psi. The<br>
inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 comprises a conical-shaped surface 385. The aqueous ozone<br>
solution enters the bottom of the reaction vessel 350 at the inlet port 355, while fresh water is<br>
discharged from nozzles 360 toward the entering aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0054] From the inlet port 355, the aqueous ozone solution enters a cavity 358, which<br>
acts as a reservoir to receive the aqueous ozone solution. An opening 365 separates the conical-<br>
shaped surface 385 from the cavity 358. The opening 365 is in fluidic communication with the<br>
cavity 358 and the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370. The inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 has<br>
a narrow diameter toward the inlet port 355 and the opening 365 and gradually increases in<br>
diameter toward an outlet 390, which creates the conical-shaped surface 385. The opening 365<br>
is at the narrowest point of the conical-shaped surface 385.<br>
[0055] The nozzles 360 direct the fresh water at the conical-shaped surface 385.<br>
Specifically, the nozzles 360 direct the fresh water at the sloping surfaces of the conical-shaped<br>
surface 385. The conical-shaped surface has sloping surfaces or sides leading to the opening<br>
365. The direction of the nozzles 360 and the conical-shaped surface 385 imparts a rotating<br>
action or a vortex to the fresh water, and the fresh water rotates about the conical-shaped surface<br>
385 toward the opening 365. As such, fresh water from the nozzles 360 moves down the<br>
conical-shaped surface 385 in the rotating manner, under centrifugal force, which crushes ozone<br>
gas bubbles in the aqueous ozone water solution entering the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370<br>
through the opening 365 from the cavity 358 and crushes ozone gas bubbles in the aqueous<br>
ozone water solution in the cavity 358.<br>
[0056] At the opening 365, some of the rotating fresh water from the nozzles 360<br>
may enter the cavity 358. Ozone gas from the aqueous ozone solution may diffuse with the fresh<br>
water in the cavity 358 and at the opening 365. At the opening 365, the aqueous ozone solution<br>
from the cavity 358 passes into a cone void 388, which is the generally hollow central region of<br>
the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370, as defined by the conical-shaped surface 385.<br>
[0057] The inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 comprises approximately 10 to<br>
approximately 50 of the edges 380 on the conical-shaped surface 385. Each of the edges 380<br>
may comprise a generally perpendicular angle above and below the adjacent edge 380. The<br>
edges 380 form a stair-step like surface for the conical-shaped surface 385. The edges 380<br>
surround a perimeter of the cone void 388. The edges 380 are in contact with the hollow interior,<br>
i.e., the cone void 388. Other constructions, geometries, or surfaces on the conical-shaped<br>
surface 385 may be employed to reduce the bubble size of the ozone gas. For example, as shown<br>
in Figure 6, the conical-shaped surface 385 may include a plurality of the concentric ridges 382<br>
about the conical-shaped surface 385.<br>
[0058] The inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 turns the aqueous ozone solution, under<br>
high pressure, around and against the series of edges 380 on the interior conical shaped surface<br>
385 of the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370. The interaction of the fresh water, the aqueous<br>
ozone solution, and the edges 380 crush and break the ozone gas into smaller and smaller<br>
bubbles in the second aqueous ozone solution, which exits the reaction vessel 350 at the outlet<br>
390. Off-gassing of ozone gas into the cone void 388 is re-mixed into the aqueous ozone<br>
solutions. The conical-shaped surface 385 and discharge of fresh water from the nozzles 360<br>
causes the fresh water to circulate and form a vortex which mixes with the aqueous ozone<br>
solution passing through the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 and eventually exiting at the outlet<br>
390. The sleeve 370 is significant to cause the necessary break down of the microscopic bubbles<br>
of ozone gas and allows the maximum molar absorptivity of the ozone gas into the aqueous<br>
solution. The aqueous ozone solution is forced into a saturated aqueous ozone solution having<br>
an ozone concentration of up to approximately 20 ppm and an oxidation reaction potential of up<br>
to approximately 2.6. Breaking down the bubbles of ozone into smaller bubbles of ozone<br>
increases the oxidation reduction potential of the ozone in the aqueous ozone solution. The<br>
greater oxidation reduction potential of the aqueous ozone solution water allows the ozone to act<br>
not only as a sanitizer, but as a degreaser and therefore has more oxidizing power than<br>
conventionally mixed solutions.<br>
[0059] Typically, the aqueous ozone solution entering the reaction vessel 350 at the<br>
inlet port 355 and the fresh water entering the reaction vessel forms a solution that is<br>
approximately 10% to approximately 20% fresh water, i.e., approximately 1 part by volume<br>
fresh water from the water supply is mixed with approximately 4 parts to approximately 9 parts<br>
by volume aqueous ozone solution from the inlet port 355. However, due to the crushing of the<br>
ozone bubbles in the reaction vessel 350, the ORP value for the aqueous ozone solution exiting<br>
the outlet 390 is approximately the same as the ORP value for the aqueous ozone solution<br>
entering the inlet 355, despite the dilution of the aqueous ozone solution entering the inlet 355 by<br>
the fresh water from the nozzles 360.<br>
[0060] The reaction vessel 350 and the inner vortex assembly sleeve may be made<br>
from stainless steel, metal alloys, or hard plastic materials, such as chlorinated Polyvinyl<br>
Chloride (CPVC).<br>
[0061] From the outlet port 390 of the reaction vessel 350, the aqueous ozone<br>
solution is directed to the contact tank 405 and a degassing separator 420 in communication with<br>
the reaction vessel 350. The contact tank 405 should have a volume approximately twice the<br>
desired amount of volume of aqueous ozone solution. For example, if the mixing skid 300a is<br>
providing 100 gallons/per minute in flow, then the contact tank 405 should have a capacity of<br>
approximately 200 gallons. As such, in this particular example, the solution is spending<br>
approximately two minutes in the contact tank 405.<br>
[0062] Large gas bubbles are separated from the aqueous ozone solution in the<br>
degassing separator 420. The degassing separator is important to remove the excess ozone<br>
bubbles from the aqueous ozone solution to reduce the levels of free ozone gas released at an<br>
application point during the spraying of the aqueous ozone solution, which in high<br>
concentrations could breach OSHA regulations. The separated gas bubbles are directed to a<br>
demister 440, where a liquid component of the separated gas bubble is collected and drained,<br>
while an ozone gas component of the separated gas bubbles is directed from the demister 440 to<br>
the ozone destruction unit 260.<br>
[0063] The aqueous ozone solution exiting the degassing separator 420 passes<br>
through and the mixing ozone monitor 460 and on to one or more pumps 480 via piping, hosing<br>
and/or lines. Depending upon the cleaning and sanitizing application of the system 10, the<br>
aqueous ozone solution may be directed to one or more of the pumps 480 which may pump the<br>
aqueous ozone solution at different flow rates and pressures from the mixing skid 300. The<br>
aqueous ozone solution is pumped from the mixing skid 300 via distribution piping/hosing 510<br>
in communication with the pumps 480 to one or more applicators 530 for applying the aqueous<br>
ozone solution to the hard surfaces and other items for sanitation. The applicators 530 include<br>
spray wands, nozzles, brushes, nebulizers, spray guns and the like, and various combinations<br>
thereof. Each applicator 530 includes an applicator ozone monitor 550.<br>
[0064] The concentration of the aqueous ozone solution is monitored by the<br>
applicator ozone monitor 550, which measures the exact concentration of ozone in the aqueous<br>
ozone solution exiting from the applicator 530. The plant operator may monitor and adjust the<br>
concentration of ozone in the aqueous ozone solution based on readings from the applicator<br>
ozone monitor 550.<br>
[0065] The applicator ozone monitor 550 is in electrical communication with the<br>
control panel/central server 50. If the applicator ozone monitor 550 indicates that the levels of<br>
ozone in the aqueous ozone solution are too low, then the operator or automated systems in the<br>
control panel/central server 50 may adjust the mass flow controller 305 to increase the amount of<br>
ozone gas directed to the venturi 310, such that concentration levels of ozone in the aqueous<br>
ozone solution at the applicator ozone monitor 550 are increased.<br>
[0066] The system 10 may comprise one or mixing skids 300 with one or more<br>
pumps 480 supplying one or more applicators 530. The one or more pumps 480 may pump the<br>
aqueous ozone solution at different rates and at different concentrations to the different<br>
applicators 530. The system 10 may be customized, depending upon a specific industrial facility<br>
and its specific cleaning needs. For example, the system 10 may comprise a variety of high<br>
pressure and low pressure applicators 530 and with certain applicators applying different<br>
concentrations of aqueous ozone solution. The system 10 provides an applied dosage of an<br>
aqueous ozone solution that is consistent over time in terms of the desired concentration and<br>
flow rate to the one or more applicators 530. The control panel/central server 50, in conjunction<br>
with the applicator ozone monitor 550 and mass flow controllers 305, monitor and regulate the<br>
concentration and flow of the aqueous ozone solution.<br>
[0067] The reaction vessel 350 is important to the mass transfer of ozone gas in the<br>
water, i.e., how the ozone gas is dissolved into the water to form the aqueous ozone solution.<br>
The system 10 produces a saturated aqueous ozone solution having an ozone concentration of up<br>
to approximately 20 ppm.<br>
[0068] The system 10, and specifically the reaction vessel 350, help reduce the<br>
number of bubbles and create the smallest possible bubbles of ozone in the aqueous ozone<br>
solution in order to produce the saturated aqueous ozone solution with an ozone concentration of<br>
up to approximately 20 ppm and an oxidation reduction potential of 2.6. The amount of ozone<br>
dissolved into the water depends, in part, on the surface area of the gas/water interaction. The<br>
smaller the bubble, the better the mass transfer because one cubic inch of tiny bubbles has much<br>
more surface area than a single, one cubic inch bubble.<br>
[0069] The edges 380 on the inner vortex assembly sleeve 370 assist in physically<br>
reducing the bubble size of the ozone gas. As the aqueous ozone solution is forced through the<br>
inner vortex assembly sleeve 370, the bubbles of ozone contact the edges 380 and break into<br>
smaller and smaller bubbles. The smaller bubbles dissolving in the water help to saturate the<br>
aqueous ozone solution with ozone.<br>
[0070] The pressure applied in the reaction vessel 350, of approximately 50 psi to<br>
approximately 125 psi, also improves the mass transfer between the bubbles of ozone gas and the<br>
water. The higher the pressure, the more a "squeeze" is put on the transfer of gas bubbles into<br>
the water enhancing the process of dissolving the gas bubbles into the aqueous ozone solution<br>
and creating the saturated aqueous ozone solution. The higher pressure also forces the gas<br>
bubbles against the edges 380 further breaking them down into smaller bubbles.<br>
[0071] The temperature of the water is also an important consideration in the mass<br>
transfer process. At cooler temperatures, the ozone diffuses better in the water. At cooler water<br>
temperatures, the contact time between the ozone gas bubbles and the water in forming the<br>
aqueous ozone solution is reduced. In general, it is difficult for water to absorb a gas when the<br>
water is trying to become a gas. The water from the water supply 330 should be at a temperature<br>
of approximately 33° F. to approximately 50° F.<br>
[0072] The concentration of the ozone gas in the carrier gas also affects the mass<br>
transfer of the ozone gas in to the water. Higher concentrations of ozone in the carrier gas will<br>
result in higher concentrations of ozone being absorbed into the aqueous ozone solution. Corona<br>
discharge ozone generation equipment generally creates higher concentrations of ozone gas in<br>
the carrier gas than ultraviolet types of ozone generation.<br>
[0073] The system 10 produces an aqueous ozone solution to attack and destroy<br>
pathogens and act as a no-rinse sanitizer for hard surfaces in a variety of applications, especially<br>
industrial processing facilities related to food processing. The solution of aqueous ozone is<br>
applied at high pressure to the hard surfaces, and is effective for the removal of soils and bulk<br>
materials from the hard surfaces. When applied at high pressure, the solution penetrates the soils<br>
and oxides of the biofilm that acts as the bond or glue that allows the soils and oxides to attach<br>
themselves to the hard surfaces. The system 10 is designed to be the first totally chemical free<br>
system to destroy the biofilm on conveyors systems and hard surfaces during food processing<br>
production allowing for continuous or extended production.<br>
[0074] There are many applications for both high and low pressure. When the<br>
solution discharges from the assembly, the solution could be channeled into both a high pressure<br>
stream as well as a low pressure stream. The high-pressure stream of aqueous ozone solution<br>
may be better suited for cleaning and sterilizing highly soiled hard surfaces due to the extra force<br>
supplied by the high pressure aqueous ozone solution which will help destroy the biofilm<br>
adhering the soils to the hard surfaces. The low pressure aqueous ozone solution may be suited<br>
for the continuous sanitization of hard surface or application to a food item.<br>
[0075] In the embodiment shown, the ozone produced by the ozone generator 240<br>
uses a high electrical discharge called "corona discharge" or "CD". This method is most<br>
commonly used to generate usable amounts of ozone for most water treatment applications.<br>
Corona discharge creates a small, controlled lightning storm, which involves producing a<br>
constant, controlled spark (corona) across an air gap through which a prepared feed gas is<br>
passed. This feed gas may be air that has simply had most of its moisture removed or air with<br>
enhanced oxygen levels. An important aspect of using the corona discharge methods of ozone<br>
production is ensuring that feed gas is dried at the dryer 140 to a dew point of at least<br>
approximately -60F. This is important because as the electrical discharge splits the oxygen<br>
molecules, nitrogen molecules are also being split, forming several species of nitrogen oxides,<br>
which are normally benign. If feed gas is not sufficiently dried, then the nitrogen oxides<br>
combine with moisture from ordinary humidity and form nitric acid, which may be corrosive to<br>
the system 10, the hard surfaces, and the industrial facility. Consequently, proper air preparation<br>
is important for the operation of the system 10. The relative strength of corona discharge ozone<br>
expressed as a percentage of concentration by weight is commonly 0.5 — 1.7% for systems<br>
using dried air, and 1.0 — 6.0% when an oxygen enhanced feed gas is used.<br>
[0076] A properly installed and operated system 10 poses no health hazards. While<br>
ozone is a toxic gas and the established concentration limits must be adhered to, the odor<br>
threshold of 0.01 ppm is far below the safety limit of 0.1 ppm exposure over an eight hour<br>
period. The first symptoms of excessive ozone exposure are headaches, eye, nose or throat<br>
irritation or a shortness of breath. These symptoms can be relieved by the simple application of<br>
fresh air. While no deaths have been reported from ozone, sound safety practices deserve<br>
attention. Ozone off-gas containment and destruction equipment for most water treatment<br>
applications is readily available and is usually a simple device containing either activated carbon<br>
or manganese dioxide.<br>
[0077] Ozone is a much more powerful oxidizer than chlorine. Based on EPA charts<br>
of surface water CT values (disinfectant residual and time constant), chlorine CT values are<br>
nearly 100 times greater than ozone, meaning that ozone acts much more quickly than chlorine.<br>
Ozone creates none of the trihalomethanes commonly associated with chlorine compounds and<br>
properly matched to the application; ozone will reduce most organic compounds to carbon<br>
dioxide, water and a little heat. Finally, as ozone sheds the atom of the oxygen causing its<br>
molecular instability during the oxidation process, it becomes oxygen again.<br>
[0078] Facilities processing bottled water, perishable goods (meat, seafood, fruit,<br>
vegetables, etc.) are examples of ideal applications for the system 10. The fact that ozone<br>
efficiently oxidizes the organics that cause taste, odor, and color problems without leaving a high<br>
residual helps to simplify many water treatment. The lack of residual from ozone cleaning and<br>
santiation also makes ozone perfect for pre- and post-treatment processes in wash pad recycle<br>
systems, where the use of a chlorine compound would contribute to pH control or off gas<br>
problems. Additionally, ozone oxidizes and precipitates many metals and destroys some<br>
pesticides without leaving a trace. Finally, ozone functions as a preoxidizer of iron, manganese<br>
and sulfide compounds, allowing for their removal by simple direct filtration. Ozone acts<br>
quickly and easily, and the water quality resulting from its use is unmatched.<br>
