				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BASE STATION APPARATUS AND COMMUNICATION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a base station<br>
apparatus and communication method to be used in a cellular<br>
communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a cellular communication system, one base station<br>
performs radio communication with a plurality of<br>
communication terminals simultaneously. In such a<br>
cellular communication system, there is a demand for<br>
transmission efficiency to be increased.<br>
As a method of increasing the transmission<br>
efficiency over the downlink from a base station to a<br>
communication terminal, a method is proposed of<br>
performing scheduling that for allocating communication<br>
resources to communication terminals by means of time<br>
division, and of further setting a transmission rate for<br>
each communication terminal according to communication<br>
quality to transmit data. Hereinafter, this method is<br>
referred to as "adaptive modulation communication".<br>
Adaptive modulation communication will bedescribed<br>
below using FIG.1. in FIG.1, it is assumed that a base<br>
station 11 is currently performing communication with<br>
communication terminals 12 through 14, which are within<br>
the cell area 15 covered by this base station 11.<br>
Communication terminals 20 through 22 are within the range<br>
of the cell area 15, but perform communication with a<br>
base station (not shown) other than this base station<br>
11.<br>
First, the base station 11 transmits a pilot signal<br>
to communication terminals 12 through 14. Each of<br>
communication terminals 12 through 14 estimates<br>
communication quality according to a CIR (Carrier to<br>
Interference Ratio) etc., using the pilot signal<br>
transmitted from the base station 11, and calculates a<br>
transmission rate at which communication is possible.<br>
Also, based on the transmission rate at which<br>
communication is possible, each of communication<br>
terminals 12 through 14 selects a communication mode<br>
indicating a combination of packet length, error<br>
correction, and modulation method, and transmits a signal<br>
indicating the communication mode to the base station<br>
11.<br>
Based on the communication mode selected by each<br>
of communication terminals 12 through 14 , the base station<br>
11 performs scheduling, sets a transmission rate for each<br>
communication terminal, and notifies a signal indicating<br>
communication resource allocation to each of<br>
communication terminals 12 through 14 via a control<br>
channel.<br>
The base station 11 transmits data only to the<br>
relevant communication terminal in its assigned time via<br>
a data channel. For example, when time t1 is assigned<br>
to communication terminal 12, in time tl the base station<br>
11 transmits data only to communication terminal 12, and<br>
does not transmit to communication terminals 13 and 14.<br>
Also, transmission power when the base station 11<br>
transmits data to communication terminals 12 through 14<br>
is always constant.<br>
Parallel to adaptive modulation communication,<br>
ordinary CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)<br>
communication is performed in parallel between the base<br>
station 11 and communication terminals 12 through 14 in<br>
a different band from that for adaptive modulation<br>
communication.<br>
However, in above-described conventional adaptive<br>
modulation communications , the following problem arises .<br>
Referring again to FIG.1, the base station 11 transmits<br>
data to each of communication terminals 12 through 14<br>
always using fixed power, regardless of the distances<br>
to communication terminals 12 through 14. This power is<br>
high enough to ensure that reception quality is<br>
sufficiently good at all communication terminals in the<br>
cell area 15.<br>
Consequently, there is a possibility that, among<br>
communication terminals performing adaptive modulation<br>
communication with a base station other than base station<br>
11 (hereinafter referred to as "another base station"),<br>
communication terminals within the cell area 15 covered<br>
by base station 11 (in FIG.1, communication terminals<br>
20 through 22) may receive interference due to a signal<br>
transmitted to any one of communication terminals 12<br>
through 14 from base station 11. As a result, the<br>
communication quality of a communication terminal<br>
receiving interference in this way will deteriorate.<br>
For example, if the time when base station 11<br>
transmits data to communication terminal 12 via a data<br>
channel is coincident with the time when another base<br>
station transmits data to communication terminal 20 via<br>
a data channel, communication terminal 20 receives<br>
interference due to the signal transmitted from base<br>
station 11 to communication terminal 12.<br>
Also, if base station 11 transmits adaptively<br>
modulated signals to a plurality of communication<br>
terminals (for example, communication terminals 12<br>
through 14) at the same time, the communication quality<br>
of that plurality of communication terminals will<br>
deteriorate because delayed waves of the signals<br>
transmitted to that plurality of communication terminals<br>
will cause mutual interference.<br>
As explained above, in above-described conventional<br>
adaptive modulation communications there is a problem<br>
in that an adaptively modulated signal transmitted from<br>
a base station causes interference with a communication<br>
terminal performing adaptive modulation communication<br>
with another base station, or with a communication<br>
terminal performing communication with the same base<br>
station at the same time.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a base station apparatus and communication method that<br>
suppress interference to a communication terminal<br>
performing communication with another base station<br>
apparatus or a communication terminal apparatus<br>
performing communication with the same station at the<br>
same time.<br>
This object is achieved by having this base station<br>
apparatus set the transmission rate of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus based on the reception quality of that<br>
communication terminal apparatus, and perform<br>
transmission to that communication terminal apparatus<br>
using a minimum transmission power value at which the<br>
characteristics of a received signal in that<br>
communication terminal apparatus meet a desired quality.<br>
Also, the above object is achieved by having this base<br>
station apparatus set a transmission power value<br>
according to whether or not reception quality in a<br>
communication terminal apparatus is excessive, and<br>
performing transmission to that communication terminal<br>
apparatus using that transmission power value.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the accompanying drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below. In the following embodiments, a base<br>
station apparatus performs "adaptive modulation<br>
communication" whereby data is transmitted after<br>
communication resources are allocated to communication<br>
terminal apparatuses by means of time division and a<br>
transmission rate is set for each communication terminal<br>
apparatus. A pilot signal is transmitted from the base<br>
station apparatus to a communication terminal apparatus<br>
via a control channel, and data (speech, packet, etc.)<br>
is transmitted from the base station apparatus to a<br>
communication terminal apparatus via a data channel.<br>
Signals communicated via the control channel and data<br>
channel are designated "control channel signal" and "data<br>
channel signal", respectively.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the configuration<br>
of a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 1<br>
of the present invention<br>
In FIG.2, an allocation section 101 ascertains a<br>
transmission rate at which communication is possible for<br>
each communication terminal apparatus based on a data<br>
rate control (hereinafter referred to as "DRC") signal<br>
detected by a DRC signal detector 116 described later<br>
herein, determines communication resource allocation to<br>
each communication terminal apparatus, and gives an<br>
instruction for output of downlink transmit data to a<br>
buffer 102. This DRC signal is a signal indicating a<br>
transmission rate at which reception is possible by a<br>
communication terminal apparatus at the desired quality.<br>
A detailed description of this DRC signal will be given<br>
later herein.<br>
The allocation section 101 also indicates the<br>
downlink transmit data coding method to an adaptive coding<br>
section 103, indicates the downlink transmit data<br>
modulation method to an adaptive modulator 104, and<br>
indicates a spreading code by which downlink transmit<br>
data is to be multiplied to an adaptive spreader 105.<br>
The buffer 102 holds downlink transmit data, and<br>
outputs downlink transmit data for a predetermined<br>
communication terminal apparatus to the adaptive coding<br>
section 103 in accordance with an instruction from the<br>
allocation section 101. In accordance with an<br>
instruction from the allocation section 101, the adaptive<br>
coding section 103 performs coding on transmit data from<br>
the buffer 102, and outputs the coded transmit data to<br>
the adaptive modulator 104.<br>
In accordance with an instruction from the<br>
allocation section 101, the adaptive modulator 104<br>
modulates transmit data coded by the adaptive coding<br>
section 103, and outputs the modulated transmit data to<br>
the adaptive spreader 105. In accordance with an<br>
instruction from the allocation section 101, the adaptive<br>
spreader 105 spreads transmit data modulated by the<br>
adaptive modulator 104, and outputs the spread transmit<br>
data to a multiplexer 108.<br>
Meanwhile a modulator 106 modulates a pilot signal<br>
and outputs the modulated pilot signal to a spreader<br>
107.The spreader 107 spreads modulated pilot signal by<br>
modulator 106 and outputs the resulting signal to the<br>
multiplexr 108.<br>
The multiplexer 108 performs time multiplexing of<br>
spread downlink transmit data and a spread pilot signal<br>
to generate a transmit signal, and outputs the generated<br>
transmit signal to a power controller 109. At the start<br>
of communication, only a pilot signal is output from the<br>
multiplexer 108 to the power controller 109.<br>
The power controller 109 amplifies the transmit<br>
signal generated by the multiplexer 108 so as to be at<br>
the transmission power value set by a power setting section<br>
118 described later herein, and outputs the amplified<br>
transmit signal to a transmitting RF section 110.<br>
The transmitting RF section 110 converts the<br>
frequency of the transmit signal amplified by the power<br>
controller 109 to a radio frequency, and. outputs this<br>
signal to a duplexer 111. The duplexer 111 transmits the<br>
transmit signal converted to a radio frequency by the<br>
transmitting RF section 110 to a communication terminal<br>
apparatus via an antenna 112. The duplexer 111 also<br>
outputs a signal transmitted by a communication terminal<br>
apparatus and received via the antenna 112 (received<br>
signal) to a receiving RF section 113.<br>
The receiving RF section 113 converts the frequency<br>
of a received signal from the duplexer 111 to baseband,<br>
and outputs the received signal converted to baseband<br>
to a despreader 114. The despreader 114 despreads the<br>
received signal converted to a baseband signal and outputs<br>
the resulting signal to a demodulator 115. The<br>
demodulator 115 demodulates the received signal despread<br>
by the despreader 114 to generate a demodulated signal,<br>
and outputs the generated demodulated signal to the DRC<br>
signal detector 116 and a power margin information<br>
detector 117.<br>
The DRC signal detector 116 detects a DRC signal<br>
from the demodulated signal generated by the demodulator<br>
115, and outputs the detected DRC signal to the allocation<br>
section 101. The power margin information detector 117<br>
detects power margin information from the demodulated<br>
signal generated by the demodulator 115, and outputs the<br>
detected power margin information to a power setting<br>
section 118.<br>
Using power margin information from the power margin<br>
information detector 117, the power setting section 118<br>
sets a transmit signal transmission power value for each<br>
communication terminal apparatus, and outputs the set<br>
transmission power values to the power controller 109.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the configuration<br>
of a communication terminal apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
In FIG.3, a requested modulation method<br>
determination section 201 determines a transmission rate<br>
at which a communication terminal apparatus can receive<br>
at the desired quality, based on a CIR measured by a CIR<br>
measurement section 214 described later herein, and<br>
outputs the determined transmission rate to a margin<br>
calculator 202 and DRC signal creation section 203.<br>
Based on the determined transmission rate, the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
also indicates a spreading code by which a received signal<br>
is to be multiplied to an adaptive despreader 210,<br>
indicates the received signal modulation method to an<br>
adaptive demodulator 211, and indicates the received<br>
signal decoding method to an adaptive decoding section<br>
212.<br>
Using the CIR measured by the CIR measurement section<br>
214 described later herein and the transmission rate<br>
determined by the requested modulation method<br>
determination section 201, the margin calculator 202<br>
calculates a power margin and outputs information<br>
relating to the calculated power margin—that is, power<br>
margin information—to a combiner 215.<br>
The DRC signal creation section 203 creates a DRC<br>
signal indicating the transmission rate calculated by<br>
the requested modulation method determination section<br>
201, and outputs this DRC signal to the combiner 215.<br>
The combiner 215 generates a combined signal by<br>
combining the DRC signal from the DRC signal creation<br>
section 203 and power margin information from the margin<br>
calculator 202 , and outputs the generated combined signal<br>
to a modulator 204.<br>
The modulator 204 modulates the combined signal from<br>
the combiner 215 and outputs the resulting signal to a<br>
spreader 205. The spreader 205 spreads the combined<br>
signal modulated by the modulator 204, and outputs the<br>
resulting signal to a transmitting RF section 206. The<br>
transmitting RF section 206 converts the frequency of<br>
the combined signal spread by the spreader 205 to a radio<br>
frequency, and outputs this signal to a duplexer 207.<br>
The duplexer 207 transmits the combined signal that<br>
has undergone frequency conversion by the transmitting<br>
RF section 206 to a base station apparatus via an antenna<br>
208. The duplexer 207 also outputs a signal transmitted<br>
by a base station apparatus and received via the antenna<br>
208 (received signal) to a receiving RF section 209.<br>
The receiving RF section 209 converts the frequency<br>
of a received signal from the duplexer 207 to baseband,<br>
and outputs the received signal converted to baseband<br>
to the adaptive despreader 210 and a despreader 213.<br>
In accordance with an instruction from the requested<br>
modulation method determination section 201, the adaptive<br>
despreader 210 despreads the received signal from the<br>
receiving RF section 209, extracts components other than<br>
the pilot signal (components corresponding to data) in<br>
the received signal, and outputs the extracted components<br>
to the adaptive demodulator 211. In accordance with an<br>
instruction from the requested modulation method<br>
determination section 201, the adaptive demodulator 211<br>
demodulates the components extracted by the adaptive<br>
despreader 210, and generates a demodulated signal. The<br>
adaptive decoding section 212 obtains receive data by<br>
decoding the demodulated signal from the adaptive<br>
demodulator 211 in accordance with an instruction from<br>
the requested modulation method determination section<br>
201.<br>
Meanwhile the despreader 213 despreads the received<br>
signal from the receiving RF section 209, extracts the<br>
pilot signal component in the received signal, and outputs<br>
the extracted pilot signal component to the CIR<br>
measurement section 214. Using the pilot signal<br>
component from the despreader 213, the CIR measurement<br>
section 214 measures the CIR and outputs the measured<br>
CIR to the requested modulation method determination<br>
section 201 and margin calculator 202.<br>
Next, operations performed between the base station<br>
apparatus shown in FIG.2 and the communication terminal<br>
apparatus shown in FIG.3 will be described.<br>
First, at the start of communication, in the base<br>
station a pilot signal is modulated by a modulator 106,<br>
spread by a spreader 107, and output to the multiplexer<br>
108. Only the despread pilot signal is output from the<br>
multiplexer 108 to the power controller 109. The pilot<br>
signal from the multiplexer 108 is amplified by the power<br>
controller 109 so as to attain a predetermined<br>
transmission power value. The amplified pilot signal is<br>
frequency-converted to a radio frequency by the<br>
transmitting RF section 110, and is transmitted to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses from the antenna 112<br>
via the duplexer 111. This pilot signal is transmitted<br>
to the communication terminal apparatuses via a control<br>
channel.<br>
The pilot signal (control channel signal)<br>
transmitted by the base station apparatus is received<br>
at the antenna 2 08 of the communication terminal apparatus.<br>
The signal received by the antenna 208 (received signal)<br>
is output to the receiving RF section 209 via the duplexer<br>
207. The received signal from the duplexer 207 is<br>
frequency-converted to baseband by the receiving RF<br>
section 209, and despread by the despreader 213 . By this<br>
means , the pilot signal in the received signal is extracted<br>
by the despreader 213. The extracted pilot signal is<br>
output to the CIR measurement section 214.<br>
In the CIR measurement section 214, the CIR is<br>
measured based on the pilot signal output by the despreader<br>
213. The measured CIR is sent to the requested modulation<br>
method determination section 201 and margin calculator<br>
202.<br>
In the requested modulation method determination<br>
section 201, a transmission rate at which it is possible<br>
for this communication terminal apparatus to receive at<br>
the desired quality is determined based on the CIR measured<br>
by the CIR measurement sect ion 214. The transmission rate<br>
determination method used by the requested modulation<br>
method determination section 201 will now be described<br>
using FIG.4. FIG.4 is a diagram showing the method of<br>
transmission rate determination by the requested<br>
modulation method determination section 201 of a<br>
communication terminal apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
1 of the present invention.<br>
In the requested modulation method determination<br>
section201, based ontheCIR (reception quality) measured<br>
by the CIR measurement section 214, a transmission rate<br>
to be requested of the base station is determined so that<br>
the received signal characteristics (error rate<br>
characteristics) of this communication terminal<br>
apparatus meet the desired quality, and data transmission<br>
efficiency is optimal.<br>
Specifically, when, for example, the CIR measured<br>
by the CIR measurement section 214 is a value as shown<br>
in FIG. 4 ( reception CIR 301), transmission rates at which<br>
the received signal characteristics of this communication<br>
terminal apparatus meet the desired quality (assuming<br>
a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-3) are any of the following:<br>
the transmission rate for QPSK, the transmission rate<br>
for 16QAM, and the transmission rate for 64QAM. Of these<br>
transmission rates, the transmission rate at which data<br>
transmission efficiency is optimal is that for 64QAM.<br>
As a result, when a CIR such as that shown in FIG.4 is<br>
measured, the transmission rate for 64QAM is determined<br>
as the transmission rate to be requested of the base station<br>
apparatus.<br>
The transmission rate determined by the requested<br>
modulation method determination section 201 as described<br>
above is output to the margin calculator 202 and DRC signal<br>
creation section 203. After the transmission rate has<br>
been determined, a signal indicating the spreading code<br>
by which a received signal is to be multiplied, a signal<br>
indicating the received signal modulation method, and<br>
a signal indicating the received signal decoding method<br>
are output from the requested modulation method<br>
determination section 201 to the adaptive despreader 210,<br>
adaptive demodulator 211, and adaptive decoding section<br>
212, respectively.<br>
In the margin calculator 202, a power margin is<br>
calculated using the CIR measured by the CIR measurement<br>
section 214 and the transmission rate determined by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201.<br>
That is to say, in the margin calculator 202, the<br>
transmission rate determined by the requested modulation<br>
method determination section 201 is first applied, and<br>
the difference between reception quality when<br>
transmission is performed from the base station at the<br>
requested transmission rate (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"first reception quality") and the minimum reception<br>
quality necessary for the received signal characteristics<br>
in this case to meet the desired quality (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "second reception quality" ) is calculated.<br>
A power margin is then calculated as a power value<br>
corresponding to the calculated difference. This power<br>
margin is equivalent to the difference between the<br>
transmission power value in the base station apparatus<br>
necessary in order for this communication terminal<br>
apparatus to obtain the first reception quality (normally<br>
transmitted transmission power) and the transmission<br>
power value in the base station apparatus necessary for<br>
this communication terminal apparatus to obtain the<br>
second reception quality.<br>
Specifically, with reference to FIG.4, the minimum<br>
second reception quality (CIR 302) necessary for the<br>
received signal characteristics to meet the desired<br>
quality (BER = 10-3) is first calculated in accordance<br>
with a curve showing the CIR vs BER characteristic of<br>
the transmission rate determined by the requested<br>
modulation method determination section 201<br>
(transmission rate for 64QAM). The difference between<br>
the first reception quality (reception CIR 301) and second<br>
reception quality (CIR 302) is then calculated, and then<br>
the power value corresponding to the calculated<br>
difference is calculated as the power margin 303.<br>
In order to calculate the power margin, it is also<br>
possible to first calculate the transmission power value<br>
in the base station apparatus necessary for this<br>
communication terminal apparatus to obtain the first<br>
reception quality, and the transmission power value in<br>
the base station apparatus necessary for this<br>
communication terminal apparatus to obtain the second<br>
reception quality, and then calculate the difference<br>
between the transmission power values.<br>
Information relating to a power margin calculated<br>
as described above is output to the combiner 215 as power<br>
margin information.<br>
In the DRC signal creation section 203 , a DRC signal<br>
indicating the transmission rate calculated by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
is created. The created DRC signal is output to the<br>
combiner 215.<br>
In the combiner 215, a combined signal is generated<br>
by combining the DRC signal from the DRC signal creation<br>
section 203 and power margin information from the margin<br>
calculator 202. The generated signal is output to the<br>
modulator 204.<br>
The combined signal is modulated by the modulator<br>
204, spread by the spreader 205, frequency-converted to<br>
a radio frequency by the transmitting RF section 206,<br>
and transmitted to the base station apparatus by the<br>
antenna 208 via the duplexer 207.<br>
The signal transmitted by the communication<br>
terminal apparatus is received by the antenna 112 of the<br>
base station apparatus. The signal received by the<br>
antenna 112 (received signal) is output to the receiving<br>
RF section 113 via the duplexer 111. The received signal<br>
from the duplexer 111 is frequency-converted to baseband<br>
by the receiving RF section 113 , despread by the despreader<br>
114 , and demodulated by the demodulator 115. As a result,<br>
a demodulated signal is generated by the demodulator 115.<br>
The generated demodulated signal is output to the DRC<br>
signal detector 116 and power margin information detector<br>
117.<br>
In the power margin information detector 117 , power<br>
margin information is detected from the demodulated<br>
signal from the demodulator 115. The detected power<br>
margin information is output to the power setting section<br>
118.<br>
In the power setting section 118, the power margin<br>
of each communication terminal apparatus is recognized<br>
by means of the detected power margin information. In<br>
the power setting section 118, also, a transmit signal<br>
transmission power value is set for each communication<br>
terminal apparatus, taking account of the recognized<br>
power margin of the communication terminal apparatuses.<br>
Specifically, whereas in conventional adaptive<br>
modulation communication the transmit signal<br>
transmission power of each communication terminal<br>
apparatus is always taken as a predetermined transmission<br>
power value (constant), in this embodiment a value<br>
obtained by subtracting the power margin of a<br>
communication terminal apparatus from a predetermined<br>
transmission power value is set as the transmit signal<br>
transmission power value of that communication terminal<br>
apparatus. A communication terminal apparatus transmit<br>
signal transmission power value set in this way is<br>
equivalent to the transmission power value of the base<br>
station apparatus necessary for that communication<br>
terminal apparatus to obtain the second reception quality<br>
when the transmission rate requested by that<br>
communication terminal apparatus is applied.<br>
The transmit signal transmission power values of<br>
each communication terminal apparatus set by the power<br>
setting section 118 in this way are output to the power<br>
controller 109.<br>
Meanwhile, in the DRC signal detector 116, a DRC<br>
signal is detected from the demodulated signal generated<br>
by the demodulator 115 . The detected DRC signal is output<br>
to the allocation section 101.<br>
In the allocation section 101, communication<br>
resource allocation to each communication terminal<br>
apparatus is carried out based on the DRC signal<br>
transmitted by each communication terminal apparatus.<br>
Downlink transmit data sent from the base station<br>
apparatus to a communication terminal apparatus is stored<br>
in the buffer 102 until communication resource allocation<br>
is carried out.<br>
Downlink transmit data output from the buffer 102<br>
is coded by the adaptive coding section 103 using a coding<br>
method enabling reception by a communication terminal<br>
apparatus, demodulated by the adaptive modulator 104<br>
using a demodulation method enabling reception by a<br>
communication terminal apparatus, spread by the adaptive<br>
spreader 105 using a spreading code enabling reception<br>
by a communication terminal apparatus, and output to the<br>
multiplexer 108. In the multiplexer 108, a transmit<br>
signal is generated by having a spread pilot signal in<br>
the spread downlink transmit data time-multiplexed.<br>
The transmit signal generated by the multiplexer<br>
108 is amplified in the power controller 109 so as to<br>
attain the transmission power value set by the power<br>
setting section 118. The amplified transmit signal is<br>
frequency-converted to a radio frequency by the<br>
transmitting RF section 110, and transmitted to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses by the antenna 112<br>
via the duplexer 111.<br>
The signal transmitted by the base station apparatus<br>
is received by the antenna 208 of the communication<br>
terminal apparatus. The signal received by the antenna<br>
208 (received signal) is output to the receiving RF section<br>
209 via the duplexer 207. The received signal from the<br>
duplexer 207 is frequency-converted to baseband by the<br>
receiving RF section 209, and despread by the adaptive<br>
despreader 210 . By this means , components other than the<br>
pilot signal (components corresponding to data) in the<br>
received signal are extracted by the adaptive despreader<br>
210. The extracted non-pilot-signal components are<br>
demodulated by the adaptive demodulator 211 and decoded<br>
by the adaptive decoding section 212. By this means,<br>
received data is obtained.<br>
Next, the effects of a communication terminal<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment will be described<br>
with reference to FIG.5. FIG.5 is a diagram showing how<br>
a communication terminal apparatus and base station<br>
apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present<br>
invention perform adaptive modulation communication.<br>
In FIG.5, the base station apparatus 4 01 corresponds<br>
to the base station apparatus shown in FIG.2, and<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 402 through 404 and<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 410 through 412<br>
correspond to the communication terminal apparatuses<br>
shown in FIG.3. It is assumed that the base station<br>
apparatus 401 is currently performing communication with<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 402 through 404 , which<br>
are within the cell area 405 covered by this base station<br>
apparatus 401. It is also assumed that communication<br>
terminals 410 through 412 are within the range of the<br>
cell area 405, but are performing communication with a<br>
base station other than this base station 401. As cell<br>
areas are normally designed so as to overlap,<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 410 through 412 are<br>
within the an area that overlaps the cell area of base<br>
station apparatus 401 and the cell area of a base station<br>
other than base station apparatus 401.<br>
As described above, the base station apparatus 401<br>
performs scheduling based on the communication mode<br>
selected by communication terminal apparatuses 402<br>
through 404, sets a transmission rate for each<br>
communication terminal apparatus, and notifies a signal<br>
indicating communication resource allocation to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 402 through 404 via<br>
a control channel. The base station apparatus 401 then<br>
transmits data only to the relevant communication<br>
terminal apparatus in its assigned time via a data channel.<br>
Here, as an example, the time will be considered<br>
in which the base station apparatus 401 transmits data<br>
to communication terminal apparatus 402. According to<br>
the conventional method, when the base station apparatus<br>
401 transmits data to a predetermined communication<br>
terminal apparatus, it uses transmission power high<br>
enough to ensure that reception quality is sufficiently<br>
good at all communication terminal apparatuses in the<br>
cell area 405. In this case, as described above, a<br>
communication terminal apparatus among communication<br>
terminal apparatuses 410 through 412 receiving data from<br>
another base station apparatus will receive interference<br>
due to a signal transmitted to communication terminal<br>
apparatus 402 from base station apparatus 401.<br>
However, in this embodiment, base station apparatus<br>
401 does not transmit data to communication terminal<br>
apparatus 402 using a transmission power value high enough<br>
to ensure that reception quality is sufficiently good<br>
at all communication terminal apparatuses in the cell<br>
area 405. That is to say, when base station apparatus<br>
401 applies the transmission rate requested by<br>
communication terminal apparatus 402, its transmits data<br>
to communication terminal apparatus 402 using the minimum<br>
transmission power value necessary to ensure that the<br>
received signal characteristics of communication<br>
terminal apparatus 402 meet the desired quality. This<br>
minimum necessary transmission power value is equivalent<br>
to the minimum transmission power value necessary to<br>
ensure that the reception quality of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus within area 406 meets the desired<br>
quality.<br>
If base station apparatus 401 transmits data to<br>
communication terminal apparatus 402 using this kind of<br>
transmission power value, interference received by<br>
communication terminal apparatuses 410 through 412 that<br>
receive data from another base station apparatus due to<br>
a signal transmitted by base station apparatus 401 to<br>
communication terminal apparatus 402 will be suppressed.<br>
At this time, communication terminal apparatus 402 can<br>
obtain a received signal that meets the desired quality.<br>
Also, it goes without saying that base station<br>
apparatus 401 and communication terminal apparatuses 402<br>
through 404 perform ordinary CDMA communication in<br>
parallel in a different band from that for adaptive<br>
modulation communication.<br>
In this embodiment, a case has been described where<br>
a base station apparatus transmits data to only one<br>
communication terminal apparatus at one time, but the<br>
present invention can also be applied to a case where<br>
a base station apparatus transmits data to a plurality<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses at the same time.<br>
In this case, it is possible to suppress mutual<br>
interference of delayed waves of signals transmitted from<br>
the base station apparatus to a plurality of communication<br>
terminal apparatuses, thereby enabling good<br>
communication quality to be maintained for a plurality<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, when adaptive modulation<br>
communication is performed a base station apparatus does<br>
not transmit data to a communication terminal apparatus<br>
using a transmission power value that ensures that<br>
reception quality is sufficiently good at all<br>
communication terminal apparatuses within the cell<br>
covered by that base station apparatus, but instead<br>
transmits data to a communication terminal apparatus<br>
using the minimum transmission power value necessary to<br>
ensure that the received signal characteristics of that<br>
communication terminal apparatus meet the desired quality,<br>
By this means it is possible to maintain the quality of<br>
a received signal in a communication terminal apparatus<br>
at the desired quality while suppressing interference<br>
with communication terminal apparatuses, among the<br>
communication terminal apparatuses within the area<br>
covered by that base station apparatus, that perform<br>
adaptive modulation communication with another base<br>
station apparatus.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, a case has been described,<br>
as an example, where a communication terminal apparatus<br>
determines a transmission rate and power margin based<br>
on measured reception quality, and reports the determined<br>
transmission rate and power margin to a base station<br>
apparatus, after which the base station apparatus sets<br>
a transmission power value of a transmit signal for that<br>
communication terminal apparatus using the reported<br>
transmission rate and power margin, but it is also possible<br>
for a communication terminal apparatus to report a<br>
measured reception quality to a base station apparatus,<br>
and for the base station apparatus to set a transmission<br>
power value of a transmit signal for that communication<br>
terminal apparatus using a transmission rate and power<br>
margin determined based on the reported reception quality<br>
By this means it is possible to hold down the scale and<br>
power consumption of a communication terminal apparatus.<br>
Moreover, transmission of a power margin from a<br>
communication terminal apparatus may be performed only<br>
when DRC of the fastest data rate is requested. By this<br>
means it is possible to hold down the scale and power<br>
consumption of a communication terminal apparatus. In<br>
this case, being able to request a high transmission rate<br>
means that the CIR is good, and therefore the probability<br>
of being located near a base station is high. Thus, base<br>
station transmission power can be greatly reduced, which<br>
is highly effective in preventing interference.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
In this embodiment, a case is described where<br>
reduction of transmission power is taken into<br>
consideration beforehand when DRC selection is performed<br>
in a communication terminal apparatus. This embodiment<br>
is described below.<br>
First, the configuration of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus according to this embodiment will be<br>
described with reference to FIG.6. FIG.6 is a block<br>
diagram showing the configuration of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the<br>
present invention. Parts in FIG.6 identical to those in<br>
Embodiment 1 (FIG.3) are assigned the same codes as in<br>
FIG.3 and their detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
In FIG.6, a DRC signal creation section 501 creates<br>
a DRC signal using a transmission rate determined by a<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
and power margin information output from a margin<br>
calculator 202 . The DRC signal creation section 501 also<br>
outputs the created DRC signal to a modulator 502. A<br>
detailed description of the DRC signal in this embodiment<br>
will be given later herein.<br>
The modulator 502 modulates the DRC signal from the<br>
DRC signal creation section 501 and outputs the resulting<br>
signal to a spreader 205.<br>
Next, the configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described with<br>
reference to FIG.7. FIG.7 is a block diagram showing the<br>
configuration of a base station apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 2 of the present invention. Parts in FIG.7<br>
identical to those in Embodiment 1 (FIG.2) are assigned<br>
the same codes as in FIG.2 and their detailed explanations<br>
are omitted.<br>
In FIG. 7 , a power setting section 601 sets a transmit<br>
signal transmission power value for each communication<br>
terminal apparatus using the DRC signal detected by a<br>
DRC signal detector 116, and outputs the set transmission<br>
power values to a power controller 602.<br>
Power controller 602 amplifies transmit data spread<br>
by an adaptive spreader 105 soas to attain the transmission<br>
power value set by the power setting section 601, and<br>
outputs the amplified transmit data to a multiplexer 604 .<br>
A power controller 603 amplifies a pilot signal<br>
spread by a spreader 107 so as to attain a predetermined<br>
(constant) transmission power value, and outputs the<br>
amplified pilot signal to the multiplexer 604.<br>
The multiplexer 604 generates a multiplex signal<br>
by multiplexing the transmit data amplified by power<br>
controller 602 with the pilot signal amplified by power<br>
controller 603, and outputs the generated multiplex<br>
signal to a transmitting RF section 110.<br>
Next, operations performed between the<br>
communication terminal apparatus shown in FIG.6 and the<br>
base station apparatus shown in FIG.7 will be described.<br>
Descriptions of operations in this embodiment that are<br>
identical to those in Embodiment 1 are omitted, and only<br>
operations in this embodiment that differ from those in<br>
Embodiment 1 are described.<br>
In FIG.6, a transmission rate at which a<br>
communication terminal apparatus can receive at the<br>
desired quality is determined by the requested modulation<br>
method determination section 201 based on a CIR measured<br>
by the CIR measurement section 214, as described in<br>
Embodiment 1. The transmission rate determined by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
is output to the margin calculator 202 and DRC signal<br>
creation section 501.<br>
In the margin calculator 202, a power margin is<br>
calculated using the CIR measured by the CIR measurement<br>
section 214 and the transmission rate determined by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201,<br>
as described in Embodiment 1. Information relating to<br>
the calculated power margin is output to the DRC signal<br>
creation section 501 as power margin information.<br>
In the DRC signal creation section 501, a DRC signal<br>
is created using the transmission rate determined by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
and power margin information from the margin calculator<br>
202. Specifically, a DRC table showing DRC signals<br>
corresponding to transmission rates and power margin<br>
information is provided beforehand in the DRC signal<br>
creation section 501, and a DRC signal is determined<br>
unconditionally based on the transmission rate from the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201<br>
and power margin information from the margin calculator<br>
202.<br>
Whereas a DRC signal in Embodiment 1 "indicates a<br>
transmission rate at which reception is possible by a<br>
communication terminal apparatus at the desired quality" ,<br>
in this embodiment a DRC signal indicates "(1) a<br>
transmission rate at which reception is possible by a<br>
communication terminal apparatus at the desired quality<br>
and (2) the power margin when this transmission rate is<br>
selected (this power margin being of the same kind as<br>
that in Embodiment 1)".<br>
An actual example of a DRC table used by the DRC<br>
signal creation section 501 will now be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 8 . FIG. 8 is a diagram showing an example<br>
of a DRC table used by a communication terminal apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
In the DRC table shown in FIG.8, DRC signals (1<br>
through 6) are given correspondence to the modulation<br>
method (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, etc.) corresponding to the<br>
transmission rate determined by the requested modulation<br>
method determination section 201 and power margin<br>
information (0, 5, 10, 15 [dB], etc.) from the margin<br>
calculator 202.<br>
For example, when a transmission rate for 16QAM is<br>
selected by the requested modulation method determination<br>
section 201 and a power margin of 5 [dB] is calculated<br>
by the margin calculator 202 (i.e. the desired quality<br>
can be met even if transmission power is decreased by<br>
5 [dB]), a DRC signal with signal content of "4" is<br>
determined.<br>
A DRC signal created by the DRC signal creation<br>
section 501 in this way is modulated by the modulator<br>
502 and then output to the spreader 205.<br>
In FIG.7, a DRC signal detected by the DRC signal<br>
detector 116 is output to the allocation section 101 and<br>
power setting section 601. In the allocation section 101,<br>
the kind of processing described in Embodiment 1 is<br>
executed.<br>
In the power setting section 601, a transmit signal<br>
transmission power value for each communication terminal<br>
apparatus is set based on the DRC signal from the DRC<br>
signal detector 116. Specifically, in the power setting<br>
section 601, the power margin corresponding to the DRC<br>
signal from the DRC signal detector 116 is recognized<br>
using the DRC table used by the communication terminal<br>
apparatus shown in FIG.6. Also, the value obtained by<br>
subtracting this power margin from a predetermined<br>
transmission power value is set as the transmit signal<br>
transmission power value for this communication terminal<br>
apparatus.<br>
For example, when the DRC signal of a particular<br>
communication terminal apparatus is "4", in the power<br>
setting section 601 it is recognized that a request to<br>
lower the transmission power value by 5 [dB] has been<br>
made by this communication terminal apparatus, and the<br>
transmission power value of this communication terminal<br>
apparatus is set as the value obtained by subtracting<br>
5 [dB] from the predetermined transmission power value.<br>
The transmission power value set in this way is output<br>
to power controller 602.<br>
In power controller 602, transmit data spread by<br>
the adaptive spreader 105 is amplified so as to attain<br>
the transmission power value set by the power setting<br>
section 601. The amplified transmit data is then output<br>
to the multiplexer 604.<br>
In power controller 603, a pilot signal spread by<br>
the spreader 107 is amplified so as to always attain a<br>
predetermined (virtually constant) transmission power<br>
value. The amplified pilot signal is then output to the<br>
multiplexer 604.<br>
The transmit data amplified by power controller 602<br>
and pilot signal amplified by power controller 603 are<br>
multiplexed by the multiplexer 604. By this means a<br>
multiplex signal is generated. The generated multiplex<br>
signal is output to the transmitting RF section 110 . This<br>
completes the operations performed between the<br>
communication terminal apparatus shown in FIG.6 and the<br>
base station apparatus shown in FIG.7.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment a<br>
communication terminal apparatus does not transmit<br>
information indicating a transmission rate (modulation<br>
method) and information indicating a power margin<br>
individually to a base station apparatus (as in Embodiment<br>
1), but instead a communication terminal apparatus<br>
transmits to a base station apparatus information<br>
indicating a combination of transmission rate (modulation<br>
method) and power margin. By this means it is possible<br>
to reduce the amount of information (transmission rate<br>
and transmission power value related information)<br>
transmitted by a communication terminal apparatus to a<br>
base station apparatus—that is to say, the amount of<br>
information in a radio channel.<br>
For example, to consider the amount of information<br>
necessary for power margin transmission, in Embodiment<br>
1, if the power margin handled is a 2-digit value (0 to<br>
99 [dB]) at least 7 bits of information are necessary<br>
for the power margin alone, whereas in Embodiment 2, 16<br>
kinds of information indicating a combination of<br>
transmission rate and power margin can be transmitted<br>
with only 4 bits of information.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, having a base station<br>
apparatus always transmit a pilot signal (signal used<br>
as a reference when communication quality is measured<br>
in a communication terminal apparatus: reference signal)<br>
with a virtually constant transmission power value<br>
enables a communication terminal apparatus to measure<br>
communication quality accurately, thereby enabling DRC<br>
selection (modulation method and power margin selection)<br>
to be performed accurately.<br>
Furthermore, if transmission of a pilot signal by<br>
a base station apparatus with an always virtually constant<br>
transmission power value is applied to Embodiment 1, the<br>
same kind of effect is obtained as in Embodiment 2.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, a case<br>
has been described where a DRC table is used in which<br>
combinations of modulation method and power margin are<br>
set beforehand, but the contents of this DRC table (such<br>
as power reductions of 5 [dB] and 10 [dB] in the case<br>
of 16QAM transmission, for example) may also be reported<br>
in advance from a base station apparatus to a communication<br>
terminal apparatus by means of a broadcast channel before<br>
communication is carried out.<br>
It is also possible to select the optimal power<br>
reduction by adaptively changing the DRC table contents<br>
for each communication terminal apparatus according to<br>
various conditions, such as communication quality, even<br>
during communication.<br>
Moreover, in this embodiment, a case has been<br>
described where a DRC signal indicating a combination<br>
of transmission rate and power margin is transmitted,<br>
but it is also possible for a communication terminal<br>
apparatus to calculate a transmission power value in a<br>
base station apparatus based on a power margin, and<br>
transmit a DRC signal indicating a combination of<br>
transmission rate and this calculated transmission power<br>
value, and for the base station apparatus to set a<br>
transmission power value using the transmission power<br>
value in this DRC signal.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
In this embodiment, a case is described where, when<br>
transmit data communications to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality become<br>
predominant in base station apparatus downlinks (data<br>
channels), the transmission power of the pilot signal<br>
and transmit data to all communication terminal<br>
apparatuses is reduced.<br>
When transmit data communications to communication<br>
terminal apparatuses with good communication<br>
quality—that is, communication terminal apparatuses at<br>
locations near a base station apparatus (for example,<br>
communication terminal apparatuses reporting a DRC signal<br>
of 4 to 6 in FIG.8)—are predominant in downlinks within<br>
the base station apparatus cell, it is probable that there<br>
will be few cases where a downlink is allocated to a<br>
communication terminal apparatus at the edge of this cell<br>
(a communication terminal apparatus at a location far<br>
from the base station apparatus). With the conventional<br>
method, even in a case such as this the base station<br>
apparatus transmits a pilot signal and transmit data using<br>
constant power capable of reaching all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses within the cell.<br>
However, to consider firstly transmit data, in the<br>
above kind of case a base station apparatus transmits<br>
transmit data to a communication terminal apparatus at<br>
a location near that base station apparatus using constant<br>
power that ensures good reception quality at a<br>
communication terminal apparatus at a location far from<br>
that base station apparatus, even though there is little<br>
possibility of transmitting transmit data to that<br>
communication terminal apparatus at a location far from<br>
that base station apparatus. That is to say, the base<br>
station apparatus uses more than the necessary<br>
transmission power in transmitting transmit data to a<br>
communication terminal apparatus.<br>
As aresult, the base station apparatus imposes major<br>
interference on communication terminal apparatuses in<br>
a cell covered by another base station apparatus. Also,<br>
when the base station apparatus performs adaptive<br>
modulation communication with a plurality of<br>
communication terminal apparatuses at the same time, it<br>
imposes major interference on the plurality of<br>
communication terminal apparatuses in the cell covered<br>
by itself.<br>
Secondly, to consider a pilot signal, in the above<br>
kind of case a base station apparatus transmits a pilot<br>
signal using power capable of reaching all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses within the cell. Here, there is<br>
little possibility of the base station apparatus<br>
transmitting transmit data to a communication terminal<br>
apparatus at a location far from that base station<br>
apparatus. Thus, to consider only the situation where<br>
transmit data communications to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality have become<br>
predominant in base station apparatus downlinks, there<br>
is little need for a base station apparatus to transmit<br>
a pilot signal to a communication terminal apparatus at<br>
a location far from that base station apparatus.<br>
Therefore, a base station apparatus can be said to use<br>
more than the necessary transmission power in<br>
transmitting a pilot signal.<br>
Moreover, the use of more than the necessary<br>
transmission power by a base station apparatus in<br>
transmitting a pilot signal is equivalent to imposing<br>
interference on communication terminal apparatuses in<br>
the cell of another base station apparatus.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the<br>
above-described problem, when transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality have become predominant<br>
in base station apparatus downlinks (that is, when<br>
downlink quality is excessive), the base station<br>
apparatus not only reduces the transmission power of<br>
transmit data for communication terminal apparatuses with<br>
good communication quality, but also reduces the transmit<br>
data transmission power and pilot signal transmission<br>
power for other communication terminal apparatuses to<br>
the same level as the transmit data transmission power<br>
for communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality.<br>
That is to say, a base station apparatus reduces<br>
its cell radius (as each communication terminal apparatus<br>
measures communication quality using the CIR of a pilot<br>
signal, reduction of the pilot signal transmission power<br>
by a base station apparatus is equivalent to having the<br>
base station apparatus reduce the size of its cell) . In<br>
other words, a base station apparatus transmits transmit<br>
data in a concentrated fashion, using less power than<br>
the normal transmission power, to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses at locations near that base station apparatus<br>
from among communication terminal apparatuses selected<br>
as transmit data transmission destinations, and as<br>
regards communication terminal apparatuses at locations<br>
far from that base station apparatus, either has them<br>
accommodated in the cell of another base station apparatus ,<br>
or performs transmit data transmission after transmit<br>
data transmission to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
at locations near the base station apparatus is completed .<br>
By this means, a base station apparatus can suppress<br>
interference to other cells while performing<br>
communication of transmit data to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality in a<br>
concentrated fashion.<br>
When transmit data communications to communication<br>
terminal apparatuses with good communication quality<br>
become few in number, the base station apparatus restores<br>
the transmit data transmission power and pilot signal<br>
transmission power to their original levels (restores<br>
the cell to its original size) and ensures that transmit<br>
data and the pilot signal reach all communication terminal<br>
apparatuses within the cell at sufficient quality. That<br>
is to say, at this time the base station apparatus notes<br>
that many of the communication terminal apparatuses<br>
selected as transmit data transmission destinations are<br>
communication terminal apparatuses at locations far from<br>
that base station apparatus, and restores the transmit<br>
data transmission power and pilot signal transmission<br>
power to their original levels.<br>
By having all base station apparatuses perform<br>
transmission power control as described above, it is<br>
possible to reduce interference power between base<br>
station apparatuses. As a result, all base station<br>
apparatuses can reduce power consumption, enabling radio<br>
resources to be used more effectively.<br>
Next, the configuration of the above base station<br>
apparatus will be described with reference to FIG.9.<br>
FIG.9 is a block diagram showing the configuration of<br>
a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of<br>
the present invention. Here, as an example, a case is<br>
described where the base station apparatus shown in FIG. 9<br>
performs communication with the communication terminal<br>
apparatus shown in FIG.6 using the DRC table shown in<br>
FIG.8, but a communication terminal apparatus that<br>
performs communication with the base station apparatus<br>
shown in FIG.9 may be of any kind as long as it has a<br>
configuration whereby a DRC signal is notified to the<br>
base station apparatus . Parts in FIG. 9 identical to those<br>
in FIG.2 or FIG.7 are assigned the same codes as in FIG.2<br>
or FIG.7 and their detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
As in Embodiment 1, an allocation section 101<br>
determines communication resource allocation to each<br>
communication terminal apparatus based on a DRC signal<br>
(transmit data transmission is allocated preferentially<br>
to communication terminal apparatuses notifying a high<br>
DRC signal).<br>
Using a DRC signal from a DRC signal detector 116,<br>
a downlink quality estimation section 801 recognizes how<br>
many communication terminal apparatuses are<br>
communication terminal apparatuses at locations near this<br>
base station apparatus—that is, communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality<br>
(communication terminal apparatuses whose pilot signal<br>
CIR is greater than a predetermined value), and based<br>
on the result of this recognition, generates information<br>
indicating transmission power and outputs this to a power<br>
setting section 802.<br>
The power setting section 802 sets a pilot signal<br>
and transmit data transmission power value based on<br>
information from the downlink quality estimation section<br>
801, and outputs the set transmission power value to a<br>
power controller 109.<br>
Next, the operation of a base station apparatus with<br>
the above configuration will be described with reference<br>
to FIG.9 and FIG.10. FIG.10 is a flowchart showing the<br>
operation of a base station apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 3 of the present invention. Operations in this<br>
embodiment identical to operations in Embodiment 1 or<br>
Embodiment 2 are omitted.<br>
In the downlink quality estimation section 801,<br>
first, as shown in step (hereinafter referred to as "ST")<br>
901, when the number of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses reporting a DRC value of 6, or the proportion<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses reporting a DRC<br>
value of 6 among all communication terminal apparatuses<br>
that perform communication within the cell of this base<br>
station apparatus (hereinafter referred to as simply "the<br>
number or proportion of DRC-value-6 communication<br>
terminal apparatuses") exceeds a predetermined value,<br>
information indicating that the transmission power value<br>
is to be reduced by 15 [dB] below normal is output to<br>
the power setting section 802 as shown in ST902. When,<br>
on the other hand, the number or proportion of DRC-value-6<br>
communication terminal apparatuses does not exceed the<br>
predetermined value, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
ST903.<br>
In ST903, when the number or proportion of<br>
DRC-value-5-plus communication terminal apparatuses<br>
exceeds a predetermined value, information indicating<br>
that the transmission power value is to be reduced by<br>
10 [dB] below normal is output to the power setting section<br>
802 as shown in ST904 . When, on the other hand, the number<br>
or proportion of DRC-value-5-plus communication terminal<br>
apparatuses does not exceed the predetermined value, the<br>
processing flow proceeds to ST905.<br>
In ST905, when the number or proportion of<br>
DRC-value-4-plus communication terminal apparatuses<br>
exceeds a predetermined value, information indicating<br>
that the transmission power value is to be reduced by<br>
5 [dB] below normal is output to the power setting section<br>
802 as shown in ST906 . When, on the other hand, the number<br>
or proportion of DRC-value-4-plus communication terminal<br>
apparatuses does not exceed the predetermined value, the<br>
processing flow proceeds to ST907.<br>
In ST907, it is recognized that transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality are not predominant in<br>
base station apparatus downlinks, and information<br>
indicating that the transmission power value is to be<br>
restored to normal is output to the power setting section<br>
802.<br>
Thereafter, in the power setting section 802 the<br>
pilot signal and transmit data transmission power value<br>
is set based on information indicated by the downlink<br>
quality estimation section 801. That is to say, based<br>
on information from the downlink quality estimation<br>
section 801, the pilot signal and transmit data<br>
transmission power value is set by subtracting one or<br>
other of 15 [dB] (ST902), 10 [dB] (ST9 04 ) , 5 [dB] (ST906) ,<br>
or 0 [dB] (ST907) from the normal transmission power value.<br>
It goes without saying that "normal transmission power<br>
value" here is equivalent to a transmission power value<br>
that enables all communication terminal apparatuses in<br>
the cell of this base station apparatus to receive at<br>
sufficient quality.<br>
Setting a value to be subtracted from the normal<br>
transmission power value according to the size of the<br>
DRC value (ST902, St904, ST906, and ST907 in FIG.10) is<br>
done in consideration of the fact that the optimal value<br>
of a transmission power value for a communication terminal<br>
apparatus differs according to the size of the DRC value<br>
reported by that communication terminal apparatus—that<br>
is , the distance of that communication terminal apparatus<br>
from the base station apparatus. By this means it is<br>
possible to reliably maintain good reception quality in<br>
communication terminal apparatuses that receive transmit<br>
data.<br>
Thereafter, a transmit signal generated by a<br>
multiplexer 108 (a signal in which a pilot signal and<br>
transmit data for each communication terminal apparatus<br>
is multiplexed) is uniformly amplified by the power<br>
controller 109 so as to attain the transmission power<br>
value set by the power setting section 802 , and is output<br>
to the transmitting RF section 110.<br>
Next, the reason for reducing not only the<br>
transmission power value of transmit data for all<br>
communication terminal apparatuses but also the pilot<br>
signal transmission power value will be explained. If<br>
only the transmit data transmission power value were<br>
reduced and the pilot signal transmission power value<br>
were made the normal value, there would be a possibility<br>
of reception quality when receiving a pilot signal in<br>
communication terminal apparatuses in the cell of another<br>
base station apparatus being lower than reception quality<br>
when actually receiving transmit data. Thus, these<br>
communication terminal apparatuses would report to the<br>
base station apparatus a lower transmission rate than<br>
the actual transmission rate sufficient to meet the<br>
predetermined reception quality. As a result, the<br>
downlink total throughput (total transmit data<br>
transmitted to communication terminal apparatuses) in<br>
the above-mentioned other base station apparatus would<br>
fall.<br>
Thus , in this embodiment, the transmit data and pilot<br>
signal transmission power values for all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses are reduced to the same level. By<br>
this means it is possible to prevent a fall in total<br>
throughput in another base station apparatus.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, by having a base<br>
station apparatus determine the transmission power value<br>
of the pilot signal and transmit data for all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses according to the proportion of<br>
transmit data communications on downlinks to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality (located near the base station<br>
apparatus)—that is, the proportion of transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality on downlinks—it is<br>
possible to suppress interference to communication<br>
terminal apparatuses present in the cell of that base<br>
station apparatus and the cell of another base station<br>
apparatus, and also to improve downlink total throughput<br>
(the total amount of transmit data transmitted to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses).<br>
Specifically, when the proportion of transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality on downlinks is large,<br>
by uniformly reducing the transmission power values of<br>
the pilot signal and transmit data for all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses it is possible to maintain reception<br>
quality in those communication terminal apparatuses with<br>
good communication quality while suppressing<br>
interference to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
present in the cell of the relevant base station apparatus<br>
and the cell of another base station apparatus.<br>
When, on the other hand, the proportion of transmit<br>
data communications to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality on downlinks<br>
is small, since reception quality in many communication<br>
terminal apparatuses at locations far from the base<br>
station apparatus will degrade, and consequently downlink<br>
total throughput will fall, when the transmission power<br>
values of the pilot signal and transmit data for all<br>
communication terminal apparatuses are kept reduced, the<br>
transmission power values of the pilot signal and transmit<br>
data for all communication terminal apparatuses are made<br>
the normal values. By this means it is possible to<br>
increase downlink total throughput—that is, to improve<br>
transmission efficiency.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
In above-described Embodiment 3, pilot signal and<br>
transmit data transmission power values are reduced<br>
according to the proportion of transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality on downlinks. However,<br>
reducing the transmit data transmission power value may<br>
lead to the generation of a large number of packets that<br>
are not received correctly by communication terminal<br>
apparatuses, and a fall in downlink total throughput,<br>
resulting in inefficient transmission.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, monitoring is carried out<br>
as to whether or not downlink total throughput can be<br>
maintained, and if downlink total throughput falls after<br>
the transmit data transmission power value is reduced,<br>
the transmit data transmission power value is made to<br>
approach the normal value.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described below with<br>
reference to FIG.11. FIG.11 is a block diagram showing<br>
the configuration of a base station apparatus according<br>
to Embodiment 4 of the present invention. Parts in FIG. 11<br>
identical to those in Embodiment 3 (FIG.9) are assigned<br>
the same codes as in FIG.9 and their detailed explanations<br>
are omitted.<br>
Allocation section 1001 in FIG.11 has the same<br>
configuration as allocation section 101 in Embodiment<br>
3, except for the following point. Namely, allocation<br>
section 1001 outputs the results of communication<br>
resource allocation to each communication terminal<br>
apparatus determined on the basis of a DRC signal (which<br>
transmission rate is to be used for transmission to which<br>
communication terminal apparatus) to a downlink quality<br>
estimation section 1002.<br>
Downlink quality estimation section 1002 has the<br>
same configuration as downlink quality estimation section<br>
801 in Embodiment 3, except for the following point.<br>
Namely, downlink quality estimation section 1002 monitors<br>
changes in overall downlink total throughput using<br>
allocation results from the allocation section 1001,<br>
generates information indicating transmission power<br>
based on the recognition results described in Embodiment<br>
3 and these changes in total throughput, and outputs this<br>
information to a power setting section 802.<br>
Next, the operation of a base station apparatus with<br>
the above configuration will be described with reference<br>
to FIG.11 and FIG.12. FIG.12 is a flowchart showing the<br>
operation of a base station apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 4 of the present invention. Detailed<br>
explanations of operations in FIG.12 identical to<br>
operations in FIG.10 are omitted.<br>
After the transmission power value has been reduced<br>
by 15 [dB] below normal in ST902, as shown in STllOl the<br>
downlink quality estimation section 1002 monitors<br>
downlink total throughput based on allocation results<br>
from the allocation section 1001, and determines whether<br>
or not total throughput has fallen compared to prior to<br>
the reduction in transmission power. When total<br>
throughput is not fallen, the processing flow proceeds<br>
to above-described ST901. When total throughput is<br>
fallen, the processing flow proceeds to above-described<br>
ST904 .<br>
Similarly, after the transmission power value has<br>
been reduced by 10 [dB] below normal in ST904, as shown<br>
in ST1102 the downlink quality estimation section 1002<br>
determines whether or not total throughput has fallen<br>
compared to prior to the reduction in transmission power.<br>
When total throughput is not fallen, the processing flow<br>
proceeds to above-described ST901. When total<br>
throughput is fallen, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
above-described ST906.<br>
Similarly, again, after the transmission power<br>
value has been reduced by 5 [dB] below normal in ST906,<br>
as shown in ST1103 the downlink quality estimation section<br>
1002 determines whether or not total throughput has fallen<br>
compared to prior to the reduction in transmission power.<br>
When total throughput is not fallen, the processing flow<br>
proceeds to above-described ST901. When total<br>
throughput is fallen, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
above-described ST907.<br>
In this embodiment, a case has been described where,<br>
when total throughput after a reduction in the<br>
transmission power value cannot be maintained at the total<br>
throughput prior to the reduction in the transmission<br>
power value, the transmission power value is gradually<br>
made to approach the normal value (the transmission power<br>
value is gradually raised), but the transmission power<br>
value may also be restored directly to its normal value.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, a fall in<br>
downlink total throughput caused by reducing the<br>
transmission power value can be prevented by causing the<br>
pilot signal and transmit data transmission power value<br>
to approach the normal value in accordance with changes<br>
in downlink total throughput. By this means it is<br>
possible to achieve efficient transmit data transmission.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
In this embodiment, a case is described where a base<br>
station apparatus detects, based on the number of<br>
communication terminal apparatuses notifying a<br>
predetermined DRC signal, whether or not transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality (communication terminal<br>
apparatuses at locations near that base station<br>
apparatus) have become predominant in base station<br>
apparatus downlinks (that is, whether or not downlink<br>
quality is excessive), and furthermore changes the<br>
transmission power of the pilot signal and transmit data<br>
for all communication terminal apparatuses based on the<br>
result of detection.<br>
In above-described Embodiment 3, detection is<br>
performed as to whether or not transmit data<br>
communications to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
with good communication quality have become predominant<br>
on downlinks within a base station apparatus cell, using<br>
the number of communication terminal apparatuses sending<br>
a predetermined DRC signal as a proportion of the total<br>
number of communication terminal apparatuses that are<br>
transmit data transmission destinations.<br>
However, in a case where, for example, the total<br>
number of communication terminal apparatuses that are<br>
transmit data transmission destinations is small, there<br>
is a possibility of total throughput falling when the<br>
transmission power of the pilot signal and transmit data<br>
for all communication terminal apparatuses is reduced<br>
as a result of the above proportion exceeding a threshold<br>
value.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, detection is performed<br>
as to whether or not transmit data communications to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality have become predominant on<br>
downlinks, based on the number of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses notifying a predetermined DRC signal, and<br>
the transmission power of the pilot signal and transmit<br>
data for all communication terminal apparatuses is<br>
changed based on the result of this detection.<br>
Specifically, when, for example, the number of<br>
communication terminal apparatuses notifying a<br>
predetermined DRC signal is greater than or equal to a<br>
threshold value, it is recognized that communications<br>
to communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality have become predominant in<br>
downlinks , and in order to prevent transmission from being<br>
performed using more than the necessary transmission<br>
power, the transmission power is reduced. When, on the<br>
other hand, the number of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses notifying a predetermined DRC signal is less<br>
than the threshold value, it is recognized that many of<br>
the communication terminal apparatuses that are transmit<br>
data transmission destinations are at locations far from<br>
that base station apparatus, and transmission power is<br>
restored to the normal power value.<br>
By this means it is possible to suppress interference<br>
to communication terminal apparatuses present in the cell<br>
of the relevant base station apparatus and the cell of<br>
another base station apparatus, and also to improve<br>
downlink total throughput.<br>
Next, the configurations of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus and base station apparatus according<br>
to this embodiment will be described with reference to<br>
FIG.13 through FIG.15. FIG.13 is a block diagram showing<br>
the configuration of a communication terminal apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 5 of the present invention, FIG. 14<br>
is a diagram showing an example of a DRC signal used by<br>
a communication terminal apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 5 of the present invention, and FIG.15 is a<br>
block diagram showing the configuration of a base station<br>
apparatus according to Embodiment 5 of the present<br>
invention.<br>
First, the configuration of a communication<br>
terminal apparatus will be described with reference to<br>
FIG.13. Parts in FIG.13 identical to those in FIG.6 are<br>
assigned the same codes as in FIG.6 and their detailed<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
A DRC signal creation section 1201 creates a DRC<br>
signal using a transmission rate determined by a requested<br>
modulation method determination section 201.<br>
Specifically, the DRC signal creation section 1201 has<br>
a DRC table (such as the DRC table shown in FIG. 14, for<br>
example) that shows DRC signals corresponding to<br>
transmission rates, and creates the DRC signal<br>
corresponding to the transmission rate determined by the<br>
requested modulation method determination section 201.<br>
This DRC signal creation section 1201 outputs the created<br>
DRC signal to a modulator 502.<br>
Next, the configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
will be described with reference to FIG.15. Parts in<br>
FIG.15 identical to those in FIG.9 are assigned the same<br>
codes as in FIG.9 and their detailed explanations are<br>
omitted.<br>
Using a DRC signal from a DRC signal detector 116,<br>
a downlink quality estimation section 1401 recognizes<br>
the number of communication terminal apparatuses at<br>
locations near this base station apparatus—that is,<br>
communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality (communication terminal<br>
apparatuses whose pilot signal CIR is greater than a<br>
predetermined value) , and compares the recognized number<br>
with a threshold value. This downlink quality estimation<br>
section 1401 generates information indicating<br>
transmission power based on the result of this comparison,<br>
and outputs this information to a power setting section<br>
802.<br>
Next, the operation of a communication terminal<br>
apparatus and base station apparatus with the above<br>
configurations will be described with reference to FIG. 16<br>
FIG.16 is a flowchart showing the operation of a base<br>
station apparatus according to Embodiment 5 of the present<br>
invention. Operations in this embodiment identical to<br>
operations in Embodiment 1 through Embodiment 4 are<br>
omitted.<br>
In the communication terminal apparatus shown in<br>
FIG.13, a DRC signal corresponding to the transmission<br>
rate determined by the requested modulation method<br>
determination section 201 is generated in the DRC signal<br>
creation section 1201 in accordance with the DRC table<br>
shown in FIG. 14. The generated DRC signal is output to<br>
the modulator 502.<br>
Operations in the base station apparatus shown in<br>
FIG.15 are as follows. First, as shown in ST1501, in the<br>
downlink quality estimation section 1401 the number of<br>
communication terminal apparatuses reporting a DRC value<br>
of 3 is recognized using the DRC signal from detector<br>
116, and then the recognized number is compared with a<br>
threshold value.<br>
When the result of this comparison is that the number<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses reporting a DRC<br>
value of 3 is greater than or equal to the threshold value,<br>
it is recognized that transmit data communications to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality (communication terminal<br>
apparatuses reporting a DRC value of 3) have become<br>
predominant in downlinks, and, as shown in ST1502,<br>
information indicating that transmission power is to be<br>
reduced by, for example, 1 [dB] is generated. When, on<br>
the other hand, the number of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses reporting a DRC value of 3 is less than the<br>
threshold value, it is recognized that many of the<br>
communication terminal apparatuses that are transmit data<br>
transmission destinations are at locations far from this<br>
base station apparatus, and the processing flow proceeds<br>
to ST1503.<br>
In ST1503, it is determined whether or not the<br>
transmission power value at the current point in time<br>
is the normal transmission power value (maximum value).<br>
When the transmission power value at the current point<br>
in time is smaller than the normal transmission power<br>
value, information indicating that transmission power<br>
is to be raised by, for example, 1 [dB] is generated,<br>
as shown in ST1504. When, on the other hand, the<br>
transmission power value at the current point in time<br>
is the normal transmission power value, information<br>
indicating that transmission power is not to be changed<br>
is generated, and the processing flow proceeds to ST1501.<br>
Information generated by the downlink quality<br>
estimation section 1401 as described above is output to<br>
the power setting section 802. In the power setting<br>
section 802, pilot signal and transmit data transmission<br>
power values are set based on the information indicated<br>
by the downlink quality estimation section 1401.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, a base station apparatus<br>
determines the transmission power value of the pilot<br>
signal and transmit data for all communication terminal<br>
apparatuses according to the number of communication<br>
terminal apparatuses with good communication quality<br>
(communication terminal apparatuses at locations near<br>
the base station apparatus), thereby making it possible<br>
to suppress interference to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses in the cell of that base station apparatus<br>
and the cell of another base station apparatus, and also<br>
to improve downlink total throughput.<br>
Specifically, by uniformly reducing the<br>
transmission power value of the pilot signal and transmit<br>
data for all communication terminal apparatuses when the<br>
number of communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality is greater than or equal to a<br>
threshold value, it is possible to maintain good reception<br>
quality in the above-mentioned communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality while<br>
suppressing interference to communication terminal<br>
apparatuses in the cell of that base station apparatus<br>
and the cell of another base station apparatus.<br>
When, on the other hand, the number of communication<br>
terminal apparatuses with good communication quality on<br>
downlinks is less than the threshold value, since<br>
reception quality in many communication terminal<br>
apparatuses at locations far from the base station<br>
apparatus will degrade, and consequently downlink total<br>
throughput will fall, if the transmission power values<br>
of the pilot signal and transmit data for all communication<br>
terminal apparatuses are kept reduced, the transmission<br>
power values of the pilot signal and transmit data for<br>
all communication terminal apparatuses are made to<br>
approach the normal transmission power value. By this<br>
means it is possible to increase downlink total<br>
throughput—that is, to improve transmission efficiency.<br>
Moreover, according to this embodiment, when the<br>
total number of communication terminal apparatuses that<br>
are transmit data transmission destinations is small,<br>
transmission power is changed on the basis of the number<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality, thereby enabling a fall in<br>
downlink total throughput to be suppressed to a greater<br>
extent that in Embodiment 3.<br>
In this embodiment, a case has been described, as<br>
an example, where a communication terminal apparatus<br>
notifies to a base station apparatus a DRC signal<br>
specifying only the modulation method, but it goes without<br>
saying that the present invention can also be applied<br>
to a case where a communication terminal apparatus<br>
notifies a DRC signal of the kind described in Embodiment<br>
1 through Embodiment 4.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, a case has been described<br>
where transmission power is changed on the basis of the<br>
number of communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality in order to prevent a fall in<br>
downlink total throughput due to the fact that the total<br>
number of communication terminal apparatuses that are<br>
transmit data transmission destinations is small, but,<br>
as in Embodiments it goes without saying that it is also<br>
possible to change transmission power based on the number<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality as a proportion of the total number<br>
of communication terminal apparatuses that are transmit<br>
data transmission destinations.<br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
In above-described Embodiment 5, pilot signal and<br>
transmit data transmission power values are reduced<br>
according to the number of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses with good communication quality on downlinks .<br>
However, as stated in Embodiment 4, reducing the transmit<br>
data transmission power value may lead to the generation<br>
of a large number of packets that are not received correctly<br>
by communication terminal apparatuses, and a fall in<br>
downlink total throughput, resulting in inefficient<br>
transmission.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, as in Embodiment 4,<br>
monitoring is carried out as to whether or not downlink<br>
total throughput can be maintained, and when downlink<br>
total throughput falls after the transmit data<br>
transmission power value is reduced, the transmit data<br>
transmission power value is made to approach the normal<br>
value.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described below with<br>
reference to FIG.17. FIG.17 is a block diagram showing<br>
the configuration of a base station apparatus according<br>
to Embodiment 6 of the present invention. Parts in FIG. 17<br>
identical to those in FIG.11 and FIG.15 are assigned the<br>
same codes as in FIG.11 and FIG.15 and their detailed<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
Downlink quality estimation section 1601 in FIG.17<br>
has the same configuration as downlink quality estimation<br>
section 1401 in Embodiment 5, except for the following<br>
point. Namely, downlink quality estimation section 1601<br>
monitors changes in overall downlink total throughput<br>
using allocation results from an allocation section 1001,<br>
generates information indicating transmission power<br>
based on the comparison results described in Embodiment<br>
5 and these changes in total throughput, and outputs this<br>
information to a power setting section 802.<br>
The configuration of a communication terminal<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment is the same as<br>
that in Embodiment 5 (FIG. 13 ), and a detailed explanation<br>
thereof is omitted here.<br>
Next, the operation of a base station apparatus with<br>
the above configuration will be further described with<br>
reference to FIG.18. FIG.18 is a flowchart showing the<br>
operation of a base station apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 6 of the present invention. Detailed<br>
explanations of operations in FIG.18 identical to<br>
operations in FIG.16 are omitted.<br>
After the transmission power value has been reduced<br>
by 1 [dB] inSTl502, as shown in ST1701 the downlink quality<br>
estimation section 1601 monitors downlink total<br>
throughput based on allocation results from the<br>
allocation section 1001, and determines whether or not<br>
total throughput has fallen compared to prior to the<br>
reduction in transmission power. When total throughput<br>
has not fallen, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
above-described ST1501. When total throughput has<br>
fallen, the processing flow proceeds to above-described<br>
ST1504.<br>
In this embodiment, a case has been described where,<br>
when total throughput after a reduction in the<br>
transmission power value cannot be maintained at the total<br>
throughput prior to the reduction in the transmission<br>
power value, the transmission power value is gradually<br>
made to approach the normal value (the transmission power<br>
value is gradually raised), but the transmission power<br>
value may also be restored directly to its normal value.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, a fall in<br>
downlink total throughput caused by reducing the<br>
transmission power value can be prevented by causing the<br>
pilot signal and transmit data transmission power value<br>
to approach the normal value in accordance with changes<br>
in downlink total throughput. By this means it is<br>
possible to achieve efficient transmit data transmission.<br>
(Embodiment 7)<br>
In this embodiment, a case is described where the<br>
distribution of DRC values reported by communication<br>
terminal apparatuses is used, as well as using just the<br>
number or proportion of communication terminal<br>
apparatuses reporting the highest DRC value, as an<br>
indicator for detecting whether or not downlink (data<br>
channel) quality is excessive.<br>
FIG.19A is a diagram illustrating conceptually a<br>
first example of the distribution of DRC values reported<br>
by a communication terminal apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 7 of the present invention, and FIG.19B is<br>
a diagram illustrating conceptually a second example of<br>
the distribution of DRC values reported by a communication<br>
terminal apparatus according to Embodiment 7 of the<br>
present invention. In FIG.19A and FIG.19B, the<br>
horizontal axis shows DRC values and the vertical axis<br>
shows the number of communication terminal apparatuses<br>
reporting those DRC values.<br>
When the DRC value distribution is extremely biased<br>
toward the high end (the faster transmission rate end),<br>
as shown in FIG. 19A, it can be inferred that cell downlink<br>
quality is excessive. That is to say, the base station<br>
apparatus uses more than the necessary transmission power<br>
to perform transmission, and therefore major interference<br>
is caused to communication terminal apparatuses present<br>
in the cell of that base station apparatus and the cell<br>
of another base station apparatus.<br>
In this case, reducing the pilot signal and transmit<br>
data transmission power results in the DRC value<br>
distribution not being extremely biased toward the high<br>
end (that is, in not having transmit data communications<br>
to communication terminal apparatuses with good<br>
communication quality predominate in downlinks ) , as shown<br>
in FIG.19B. By this means, it is possible to suppress<br>
interference to communication terminal apparatuses<br>
present in the cell of that base station apparatus and<br>
the cell of another base station apparatus.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described below.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus according<br>
to this embodiment is the same as that shown in FIG. 15,<br>
except that the downlink quality estimation section has<br>
the following configuration.<br>
Namely, the downlink quality estimation section<br>
calculates the average value and dispersion of DRC values<br>
(in other words, pilot signal reception quality in each<br>
communication terminal apparatus) using DRC signals from<br>
a DRC signal detector 116, and determines the DRC value<br>
distribution state based on the results of these<br>
calculations. This downlink quality estimation section<br>
generates information indicating transmission power<br>
based on the result of determination of the distribution<br>
state, and outputs this information to a power setting<br>
section 802.<br>
Next, the operation of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described with<br>
further reference to FIG.20. FIG.20 is a flowchart<br>
showing the operation of a base station apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 7 of the present invention.<br>
Explanations of operations in this embodiment identical<br>
to operations in Embodiment 5 are omitted.<br>
The downlink quality estimation section first<br>
calculates the average value and dispersion of DRC values<br>
reported by each communication terminal apparatus. In<br>
ST1901, it is determined whether the calculated average<br>
value is greater than or equal to a threshold value. When<br>
the calculated average value is greater than or equal<br>
to the threshold value, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
ST1902; when the calculated average value is less than<br>
the threshold value, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
ST1904.<br>
In ST1902, it is determined whether the calculated<br>
DRC value dispersion is less than or equal to a threshold<br>
value. When the calculated dispersion is less than or<br>
equal to the threshold value, the processing flow proceeds<br>
to ST1903 ; when the calculated dispersion is greater than<br>
the threshold value, the processing flow proceeds to<br>
ST1904.<br>
In ST1903, the DRC distribution is recognized as<br>
being extremely biased toward the high end from the fact<br>
that the calculated average value is greater than or equal<br>
to the threshold value and the calculated dispersion is<br>
less than or equal to the threshold value. Therefore,<br>
information is generated indicating that transmission<br>
power is to be reduced by, for example, 1 [dB].<br>
In ST1904, on the other hand, when the calculated<br>
average value is less than the threshold value, or the<br>
calculated dispersion is greater than the threshold value,<br>
it is recognized that the DRC distribution is not extremely<br>
biased toward the high end. Furthermore, it is determined<br>
whether or not the transmission power value at the current<br>
point in time is the normal transmission power value<br>
(maximum value). When the transmission power value at<br>
the current point in time is the normal transmission power<br>
value, the processing flow proceeds to ST1901; when the<br>
transmission power value at the current point in time<br>
is less than the normal transmission power value, the<br>
processing flow proceeds to ST1905. In ST1905,<br>
information indicating that transmission power is to be<br>
raised by, for example, 1 [dB] is generated.<br>
The information generated in ST1903 or ST1905 is<br>
output to the power setting section 802.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, by using the distribution<br>
of DRC values reported by communication terminal<br>
apparatuses, it is possible to detect reliably whether<br>
or not downlink quality is excessive—that is, whether<br>
or not transmit data communications to communication<br>
terminal apparatuses with good communication quality are<br>
predominant on downlinks.<br>
(Embodiment 8)<br>
In above-described Embodiment 7, the distribution<br>
state of DRC values is detected using the average value<br>
and dispersion of DRC values, and using the detected<br>
distribution state, transmission power is reduced by 1<br>
[dB] when the DRC distribution is biased toward the high<br>
end, and transmission power is raised by just 1 [dB] so<br>
as to bring it closer to the normal transmission power<br>
value when the DRC distribution is not biased toward the<br>
high end.<br>
However, even in a situation where the DRC<br>
distribution is biased toward the high end, there is a<br>
first case where the DRC distribution is biased toward<br>
higher DRC values and a second case where the DRC<br>
distribution is biased toward lower DRC values. The<br>
optimal transmission power value reduction amount differs<br>
according to whether the first case or the second case<br>
applies to the DRC distribution state. That is to say,<br>
considered from the standpoints of interference to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses in other cells and<br>
total throughput, it is desirable for the optimal<br>
reduction amount in the second case to be smaller that<br>
the optimal reduction amount in the first case.<br>
Similarly, even in a situation where the DRC<br>
distribution is biased toward the low end, there is a<br>
third case where the DRC distribution is biased toward<br>
lower DRC values and a fourth case where the DRC<br>
distribution is biased toward higher DRC values. The<br>
optimal transmission power value reduction amount differs<br>
according to whether the third case or the fourth case<br>
applies to the DRC distribution state. That is to say,<br>
considered from the standpoints of interference to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses in other cells and<br>
total throughput, it is desirable forthe optimal increase<br>
amount in the third case to be greater that the optimal<br>
increase amount in the fourth case.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, after DRC values for which<br>
extreme bias has occurred have been determined based on<br>
the DRC value distribution state detected using the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values, transmission<br>
power value control (that is , increase amount or reduction<br>
amount control) is performed according to the result of<br>
the determination.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described below.<br>
The configuration of a base station apparatus according<br>
to this embodiment is the same as that shown in FIG.15,<br>
except that the downlink quality estimation section has<br>
the following configuration.<br>
Namely, the downlink quality estimation section<br>
calculates the average value and dispersion of DRC values<br>
(in other words, pilot signal reception quality in each<br>
communication terminal apparatus) using DRC signals from<br>
a DRC signal detector 116, and determines the DRC value<br>
distribution state (specifically, in what DRC values bias<br>
has occurred) based on the results of these calculations.<br>
This downlink quality estimation section generates<br>
information indicating transmission power based on the<br>
result of determination of the distribution state, and<br>
outputs this information to a power setting section 802.<br>
Next, the operation of a base station apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment will be described with<br>
reference to FIG.21 and FIG.22. FIG.21 is a diagram<br>
showing an example of the relationship between average<br>
DRC values, dispersion, and transmission power values<br>
in a base station apparatus according to Embodiment 8<br>
of the present invention, and FIG. 2 2 is a flowchart showing<br>
the operation of a base station apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 8 of the present invention. Detailed<br>
explanations of operations in this embodiment identical<br>
to operations in Embodiment 7 are omitted.<br>
In the downlink quality estimation section, the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values reported by<br>
each communication terminal apparatus are first<br>
calculated. Also, information indicating transmission<br>
power is generated in accordance with the relationships<br>
shown in FIG.21, using the calculated average value and<br>
dispersion.<br>
Specifically, in ST2101, it is determined whether<br>
or not the average value and dispersion of DRC values<br>
are in area 6 shown in FIG.21. When the average value<br>
and dispersion are in area 6 (that is, when bias has<br>
occurred in the highest DRC value), information<br>
indicating that transmission power is to be reduced by<br>
10 [dB] is generated in ST2102, and then the processing<br>
flow returns to ST2101. If, on the other hand, the average<br>
value and dispersion are not in area 6, the processing<br>
flow proceeds to ST2103.<br>
In ST2103, it is determined whether or not the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values are in area<br>
5. When the average value and dispersion are in area 5<br>
(that is, when bias has occurred in a lower DRC value<br>
than in the case of area 6) , information indicating that<br>
transmission power is to be reduced by 6 [dB] is generated<br>
in ST2104, and then the processing flow returns to ST2101.<br>
When, on the other hand, the average value and dispersion<br>
are not in area 5, the processing flow proceeds to ST2105.<br>
In ST2105, it is determined whether or not the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values are in area<br>
4. When the average value and dispersion are in area 4<br>
(that is, when bias has occurred in a lower DRC value<br>
than in the case of area 5) , information indicating that<br>
transmission power is to be reduced by 3 [dB] is generated<br>
in ST2106 , and then the processing flow proceeds toST2101.<br>
When, on the other hand, the average value and dispersion<br>
are not in area 4, the processing flow proceeds to ST2107.<br>
In ST2107, it is determined whether or not the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values are in area<br>
3. When the average value and dispersion are in area 3<br>
(that is, in the most desirable case in which bias has<br>
not occurred in any DRC value), the processing flow<br>
proceeds to ST2101 without information indicating that<br>
transmission power is to be increased or reduced being<br>
generated. When, on the other hand, the average value<br>
and dispersion are not in area 3, the processing flow<br>
proceeds to ST2108.<br>
In ST2108, it is determined whether or not the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values are in area<br>
2. When the average value and dispersion are in area 2<br>
(that is, when bias has occurred in a low DRC value),<br>
it is determined in ST2109 whether or not the transmission<br>
power value at the current point in time is the normal<br>
transmission power value. When the transmission power<br>
value at the current point in time is the normal<br>
transmission power value, the processing flow returns<br>
to ST2101 without information indicating that<br>
transmission power is to be changed being generated . When<br>
the transmission power value at the current point in time<br>
is not the normal transmission power value, information<br>
indicating that transmission power is to be raised by<br>
3 [dB] is generated in ST2110, and the processing flow<br>
returns to ST2101.<br>
When, on the other hand, the average value and<br>
dispersion are not in area 2 , the processing flow proceeds<br>
to ST2111.<br>
In ST2111, it is determined whether or not the<br>
average value and dispersion of DRC values are in area<br>
1. When the average value and dispersion are in area 1<br>
(that is, when bias has occurred in a lower DRC value<br>
than in the case of area 2), it is determined in ST2112<br>
whether or not the transmission power value at the current<br>
point in time is the normal transmission power value.<br>
When the transmission power value at the current point<br>
in time is the normal transmission power value, the<br>
processing flow returns to ST2101 without information<br>
indicating that transmission power is to be changed being<br>
generated. When the transmission power value at the<br>
current point in time is not the normal transmission power<br>
value, information indicating that transmission power<br>
is to be raised by 6 [dB] is generated in ST2113, and<br>
the processing flow proceeds to ST2101.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, by determining DRC values<br>
for which extreme bias has occurred using the average<br>
value and dispersion of DRC values, and then performing<br>
transmission power control based on the result of the<br>
determination, it is possible to reduce interference to<br>
communication terminal apparatuses in other cells and<br>
execute an improvement of total throughput at high speed<br>
and with high precision.<br>
In a case where the control described in above<br>
Embodiment 1 through above Embodiment 8 is performed by<br>
all base station apparatuses, it is possible to reduce<br>
parts in which the areas of base station apparatuses<br>
overlap, and therefore, although throughput may fall at<br>
the instant at which transmission power is reduced, taking<br>
a long-term view overall system throughput can be<br>
maximized.<br>
Also, it is possible for thebase station apparatuses<br>
and communication terminal apparatuses described in above<br>
Embodiment 1 through above Embodiment 8 to be used in<br>
combination.<br>
As is clear from the above descriptions, according<br>
to the present invention it is possible to provide a<br>
communication terminal apparatus that suppresses<br>
interference to a communication terminal apparatus that<br>
performs adaptive modulation communication with another<br>
base station apparatus and a communication terminal<br>
apparatus that performs adaptive modulation<br>
communication with the local base station apparatus at<br>
the same time.<br>
