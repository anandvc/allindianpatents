FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a power transmission having three planetary gear sets<br>
that are controlled by six torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-speed<br>
transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases the<br>
overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its<br>
torque range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available<br>
in the transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is<br>
repeated. Early automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the<br>
overall speed range of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that<br>
could produce a wide speed and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a<br>
specific fuel consumption point during cruising, other than the most efficient point.<br>
Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public.<br>
These transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the<br>
vehicle. The increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and<br>
therefore improves the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges<br>
substantially imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy.<br>
While many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios,<br>
passenger	<br><br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions<br>
and relatively few five or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of<br>
these transmissions.<br>
Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the<br>
six-speed transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and<br>
nine-speed transmissions has been precluded because of complexity, size and<br>
cost.<br>
US6648789 teaches a multi-speed transmission with three interconnected<br>
planetary gear sets. The transmission has a plurality of members that can be<br>
utilized in powertrains to provide at least seven forward speed ratios and one<br>
reverse speed ratio. The transmission family members comprise three planetary<br>
gear sets and six torque-transmitting mechanisms. A fixed interconnection<br>
continuously connects members of the first, second and third planetary gear<br>
sets. The powertrain comprises an engine and torque converter that is<br>
continuously connected to one of the planetary gear members and an output<br>
member that is continuously connected with another one of the planetary gear<br>
members. The six torque-transmitting mechanisms provide interconnections<br>
between various gear members, the input shaft, the output shaft, and with the<br>
transmission housing, and are operated in combinations of three to establish at<br>
least seven forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
US 7090610 discloses wide ratio transmissions with three interconnected<br>
planetary gear sets. The family of transmissions has a plurality of members that<br>
can be utilized in powertrains to provide at least eight forward speed ratios and<br><br>
one reverse speed ratio. The transmission family members include three<br>
planetary gear sets having seven torque-transmitting mechanisms and three<br>
fixed interconnections. The powertrain comprises an engine and torque converter<br>
that is continuously connected to at least one of the planetary gear members<br>
and an output member that is continuously connected with another one of the<br>
planetary gear members. The seven torque-transmitting mechanisms provide<br>
interconnections between various gear members, the input shaft, the output<br>
shaft, and the transmission housing, and are operated in combinations of two to<br>
establish at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved transmission<br>
having three planetary gear sets controlled to provide eight forward speed ratios<br>
and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The transmission family of the present invention has three planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may<br>
comprise a sun gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any<br>
order.<br>
In referring to the first, second and third gear sets in this description and in the<br>
claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing<br>
(i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third<br>
members of each gear set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the<br>
drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br><br>
Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are<br>
also possible.<br>
A first interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the third member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
A second interconnecting member continuously connects the second member of<br>
the second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
A first torque transmitting device, such a brake, selectively connects the first<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br><br>
	A second torque transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
third member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
	A third torque transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
	A fourth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
	A fifth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
	A sixth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
The six torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engageable in<br>
combinations of three to yield eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets.<br>
	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary<br>

and the clutches 56, 57. The brake 50 engages the sun gear member 22 with the transmission<br>
housing 60. The clutch 56 engages the planet carrier assembly member 26 with the planet carrier<br>

and 40.<br>
	The eighth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the brakes<br>
50, 52 and the clutch 57. The brake 50 engages the sun gear member 22 with the transmission<br>
housing 60. The brake 52 engages the ring gear member 34 and ring gear member 24 via<br>
interconnecting member 70 with the transmission housing 60. The clutch 57 engages the sun<br>
gear member 32 with the planet carrier assembly member 46. The sun gear member 32 and<br>
planet carrier assembly member 46 rotate at the same speed as the input member 17. The ring<br>
gear member 34 and planetary gear set 20 do not rotate. The planet carrier assembly member 36<br>
and sun gear member 42 rotate at the same speed. The speed of the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 36 is determined from the speed of the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear/sun gear<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The ring gear member 44 and output member 19 rotate at<br>
the same speed. The speed of the ring gear member 44, and therefore the output member 19, is<br>
determined from the speed of the sun gear member 42, the speed of the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 46 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical<br>
value of the eighth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios<br>
of the planetary gear sets 30 and 40.<br>
	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is shown in the truth table of Figure lb. This truth table also provides an example<br>
of speed ratios and ratio steps that are available in the above described transmission. For<br>
example, the step ratio between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.43, while the<br>
step ratio between the reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.59.<br>
	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br><br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>

TITLE : "AN IMPROVED TRANSMISSION PROVIDING MULTIPLE<br>
FORWARD SPEED RATIO AND ONE REVERSE SPEED RATIO"<br>
The transmission (14) has a plurality of members that can be utilized in<br>
powertrains to provide eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
The transmission (14) comprises three planetary gear sets (20,30,40) having six<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms (50,52,54,56,58,60) and two fixed<br>
interconnections (70,72). The powertrain (10) comprises an engine and torque<br>
converter (12) that is continuously connected to one of the planetary gear<br>
members and an output member (19) that is continuously connected with<br>
another one of the planetary gear members. The six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms provide interconnections between various gear members, the<br>
transmission housing (60) and with the input member (17), and are operated in<br>
combinations of three to establish eight forward speed ratios and one reverse<br>
speed ratio.</td>
