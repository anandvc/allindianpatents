				<td>RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/643,625 filed<br>
January 13,2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of communication networks and in<br>
particular to a system and method for handing off a call between circuit switched and packet<br>
data wireless networks.<br>
The emerging technology for core networks in wireless communication systems is a packet-<br>
based, all-IP network. For example, the IP Multimedia System (IMS) is a open industry<br>
standard architecture for telecom operators to provide voice and multimedia communication<br>
services. The IMS network runs over the standard Internet Protocol (IP), providing both Voice<br>
over IP (VoIP) and data services, including audio and video broadcast or streaming,<br>
videoconferencing, games, filesharing, e-mail, and the like. The IMS network supports both<br>
packet data wireless networks, such as CDMA lx EV-DO, WLAN (WiFi), WiMAX,<br>
WCDMA, HSPDA, and the like, as well as circuit switched wireless networks, such as<br>
CDMA lx, GSM, and WCDMA.<br>
While the migration toward packet data networks is expected to continue, circuit switched<br>
wireless communication networks are widely deployed and heavily used. A heterogeneous<br>
mix of a circuit switched and packet data wireless networks will exist in the field for years to<br>
come.<br>
Mobility management is a key aspect of wireless communication systems, necessary to<br>
maintain communications with mobile terminals as users move throughout different<br>
geographic areas. Mobile Assisted Hand-Off (MAHO) is a well-known element of mobility<br>
management. In MAHO, mobile terminals report channel conditions, desired data rates, pilot<br>
strengths signals from neighboring radio base stations, and the like to a serving base station,<br>
which, using this information as well as the relative loading among neighboring base stations,<br>
2<br><br>
determines if, when, and to which base station to hand off a mobile terminal. Intra-system<br>
handoff is a fundamental operational aspect of any wireless communication system.<br>
Inter-system handoff, however, may be problematic for several reasons. First, mobile<br>
terminals must be developed and deployed to that are capable of engaging in communications<br>
with both circuit switched and packet data wireless networks. Additionally, in most<br>
deployments, circuit switched and packet data wireless networks operate in different<br>
frequency bands. Hybrid mobile terminals exist which can operate in both frequency bands<br>
simultaneously; however soft inter-system handoff is impossible due to the different radio<br>
technologies used. Additionally, network protocols in the circuit switched and packet data<br>
systems do not directly support inter- system handoff.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one or more embodiments, the present invention relates to handing off a hybrid mobile<br>
terminal between packet data and circuit switched wireless networks. The hybrid mobile<br>
terminal is engaged in an existing call through a serving one of the wireless networks. The<br>
mobile terminal places a new call through the target one of the wireless networks, the new call<br>
having a predetermined called party identifier. In response to the called party identifier, the<br>
call is converted to a loop-back call directed to the mobile terminal through the serving<br>
wireless network, establishing a call path through the target wireless network. The mobile<br>
terminal accepts the loop-back call, and directs the existing call to connect to the call path<br>
through the target wireless network. The existing call through the original network is then<br>
dropped.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of hand off from a serving one<br>
of a packet data or circuit switched wireless network to a target one of the networks, for a<br>
hybrid mobile terminal capable of communications through both networks and engaged in an<br>
existing call through the serving wireless networks. A new call is received from the mobile<br>
terminal through the target wireless network, the new call having a predetermined called party<br>
identifier. In response to the called party identifier, the new call is routed back to the mobile<br>
terminal through the serving wireless network. The existing call is connected to the mobile<br>
terminal through the target wireless network.<br>
3<br><br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of handing off a hybrid<br>
mobile terminal, operative to communicate through both packet data and circuit switched<br>
wireless networks, from a serving one of such networks initially carrying an existing call to a<br>
target one of such networks. A new call, having a predetermined called party identifier, is<br>
generated through the target wireless network. A loop-back call is accepted through the<br>
serving wireless network. In response to the loop-back call, the existing call is continued<br>
through the target wireless.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a circuit switched wireless<br>
network, including a subscriber database maintaining a plurality of subscriber profiles and at<br>
least one fictitious subscriber profile having a predetermined Mobile Directory Number<br>
(MDN) and identifying a call directed to the predetermined MDN as a handoff loop-back call.<br>
The circuit switched wireless network also includes a network node operative to redirect a<br>
handoff loop-back call to the mobile terminal that originated the call.<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention relates to a packet data wireless network,<br>
including a Public Service Identifier Application Server (PSI-AS) operative to redirect a<br>
handoff loop-back call to the mobile terminal that originated the call. The packet data wireless<br>
network also includes a network node operative to receive a Initial Address Message (IAM)<br>
from a circuit switched wireless network, the IAM having a predetermined MDN as the called<br>
party identifier, and further operative to convert the called party identifier from the<br>
predetermined MDN to the sip:uri address of the PSI-AS.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one or more embodiments, the present invention relates to a system and method of handing<br>
off a hybrid mobile terminal between packet data and circuit switched wireless networks. As<br>
used herein, a hybrid mobile terminal refers to a mobile device having the radio transceivers,<br>
functionality, and if necessary the authorization, to engage in voice and/or data<br>
communications with both a packet data wireless network and a circuit switched wireless<br>
network. Due to different operating frequencies and a lack of protocols between the networks<br>
themselves, it is not currently possible to hand off an existing call from one network to the<br>
other, such as may become necessary if the hybrid mobile terminal moves from a geographic<br>
area served by one network into an area served by the other.<br>
Any new handoff method should work equally well in either direction. That is, it must provide<br>
for handoff from a packet data wireless network to a circuit switched wireless network, as<br>
well as from the circuit switched to the packet data wireless network. In the following<br>
5<br><br>
discussion, the "serving" wireless network is the network through which an existing call is<br>
routed to the hybrid mobile terminal, and may be either a packet data or a circuit switched<br>
wireless network. The "target" wireless network is the other network, through which the call<br>
will be connected following the handoff procedure.<br>
One way to establish a call path through the target wireless network is for the corresponding<br>
functionality in the mobile terminal to place a call through the target wireless network to its<br>
functionality corresponding to the serving network. The existing call may subsequently be<br>
connected to the newly established call path. That is, the packet data side of the hybrid mobile<br>
terminal places a call to the circuit switched side of the same hybrid mobile terminal, or vice<br>
versa. Such a call is referred to herein as a loop-back call.<br>
However, most existing networks interpret a call to the originator - that is, a call where the<br>
Calling Party Number (CgPN) and the Called Party Number (CdPN) are the same - as a call to<br>
access the user's voicemail box. Thus, to work within existing networks, the CgPN and the<br>
CdPN must be different. In circuit switched wireless networks, the Mobile Directory Number<br>
(MDN) of the hybrid mobile terminal is inserted into the Initial Address Message (IAM) as<br>
the CgPN (also referred to as the A-Number) by the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) serving<br>
the mobile terminal, as part of the Line Identification functionality. Accordingly, altering the<br>
CgPN is not an option.<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a loop-back call is<br>
established by a hybrid mobile terminal placing a call having a Transfer Routing Number<br>
(TRN) as the CdPN. A unique TRN is defined for each network: TRNpd for the packet data<br>
wireless network and TRNcs for the circuit switched wireless network. When a (target)<br>
network receives a call request from a hybrid mobile terminal where the CdPN is the TRN for<br>
that network (and the CgPN = MDN), the network recognizes the call as a loop-back call, and<br>
routes the call back to the hybrid mobile terminal through the other (serving) wireless<br>
network. This may be accomplished, for example, by swapping the called and calling party<br>
identifiers (i.e., CgPN = TRN and CdPN = MDN), and routing the call to the serving wireless<br>
network.<br>
6<br><br>
The call arrives at the hybrid mobile terminal through the serving wireless network. The<br>
hybrid mobile terminal recognizes the loop-back call by virtue of the TRN and/or MDN. The<br>
hybrid mobile terminal accepts the call, and transfers the existing call to its functionality<br>
associated with the target wireless network. The serving wireless network (or the hybrid<br>
mobile terminal) may then connect the existing call to the call path established through the<br>
target wireless network, and drop the leg of the existing call through the serving wireless<br>
network, effectively handing off the call from the serving to the target wireless network.<br>
Packet Data Network to Circuit Switched Network Handoff<br>
Figure 1 depicts a hybrid mobile terminal 10, comprising both packet data wireless network<br>
Access Terminal (AT) and circuit switched wireless network Mobile Station (MS)<br>
functionality. The hybrid AT/MS 10 is in a Roaming Area 12, in which a circuit switched<br>
wireless network 20 and a packet data wireless network 30 are operative.<br>
The circuit switched wireless network 20 comprises a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 22,<br>
connected to one or more circuit switched Base Station Controllers (CS BSC) 24 providing<br>
communication services to one or more mobile stations (not shown). The MSC 22 routes<br>
voice and data over circuit switched network connections between the CS BSC 24 and<br>
numerous other network nodes (not shown). The CS BSC 24 includes or controls one or more<br>
radio base stations or base station transceivers (not shown) that include the transceiver<br>
resources necessary to support radio communication with mobile stations, such as<br>
modulators/demodulators, baseband processors, radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers,<br>
antennas, and the like.<br>
The packet data wireless network 30 comprises a Packet Data Switching Node (PDSN) 32<br>
connected to one or more packet data Base Station Controllers (PD BSC) 34 providing packet<br>
data communication services to one or more access terminals, such as the AT side of hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10. The PDSN 32 routes data packets between the PD BSC 34 and other packet data<br>
networks, such as an IP Media System (IMS) network 40. The PD BSC 34 includes or<br>
controls one or more radio base stations similar to the CS BSC 24, but provides packet data<br>
communications on shared, high-bandwidth channels to ATs.<br>
7<br><br>
Both wireless networks 20, 30 are connected to an IMS network 40. The IMS is a general-<br>
purpose, open industry standard for voice and multimedia communications over packet- based<br>
IP networks 40. The IMS network 40 includes one or more Application Servers (AS) 42<br>
providing various services (audio and video broadcast or streaming, push-to-talk,<br>
videoconferencing, games, filesharing, e-mail, and the like). In particular, a Telephony AS<br>
(TAS) 50 provides telephonic communications services, as described in more detail herein.<br>
Another AS within the IMS 40 is a Public Service Identifier (PSI) AS 46. The PSI AS 48 is a<br>
generic AS that handles session transfer between IP connectivity points for a specific<br>
terminal. The PSI AS 46 handles inter-system handoffs within a system.<br>
Communications between nodes within the IMS network 40 utilize the Session Initiation<br>
Protocol (SIP). SIP is a signaling protocol for Internet conferencing, telephony, presence,<br>
events notification, instant messaging, and the like. SIP uses a long-term stable identifier, the<br>
SIP Universal Resource Indicator (URI).<br>
The PSI-AS 48 and TAS 50 are connected to a Serving-Call Session Control Function (S-<br>
CSCF) 44. The S-CSCF 44 initiates, manages, and terminates multimedia sessions between<br>
IMS 40 terminals. The S-CSCF 44 may be connected to an optional Interrogating- CSCF (I-<br>
CSCF) 48. The I-CSCF 48 is a SIP proxy located at the edge of an administrative domain.<br>
The I-CSCF (or S-CSCF if a I-CSCF is not present) is connected to a Proxy-CSCF (P- CSCF)<br>
52. The P-CSCF 52 is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact to the IMS 40.<br>
Both the PSDN 32 of the packet data wireless network 30 and a Media Gateway Control<br>
Function (MGFC2) 54 maintain SIP connections to the P-CSCF 52. The MGCF2 54 controls a<br>
media gateway (MGw2) 56, connected to the MSC 22 of the circuit switched wireless network<br>
20 via a dedicated handoff trunk. The MGCF2 54 maintains a ISUP connection to the MSC<br>
22.<br>
Figure 1 A depicts the hybrid AT/MS 10 engaged in a voice call with a party in the Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 62. The PSTN 62 is connected to the IMS network 40<br>
by a PSTN interface 60 including a MGCF1 66 controlling a MGw1 64. The MGw1 64 is<br>
connected to the PSTN 62 over a time division multiplexed (TDM) link. The MGw1 64<br>
translates coded voice packets or circuit switched 64-kbps Pulse Code Modulated (PCM)<br>
8<br><br>
voice signals from the PTSN 62 to coded voice packets, such as for example Enhanced<br>
Variable Rate CODEC (EVRC) packets, which are then transmitted via Real-time Transport<br>
Protocol (RTP) or Internet Protocol (IP) to other nodes in the IMS network 40.<br>
The call depicted in Figure 1 A was set up by, and is maintained by, the TAS 50. The TAS 50<br>
serves as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA). A B2BUA is a SIP based logical entity that<br>
can receive and process SIP INVITE messages as a SIP User Agent Server (UAS). The<br>
B2BUA also acts as a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) that determines how the request should<br>
be answered and how to initiate outbound calls. Unlike a SIP proxy server, the B2BUA<br>
maintains complete call state and participates in all call requests. In particular, for the call of<br>
Figure 1 A, the B2BUA controls two SIP dialogs: a first dialog between the MGCF1 66 and<br>
the TAS 50; and a second dialog between the TAS 50 and the AT (IMS client) side of the<br>
hybrid AT/MS 10. In the media plane or user plane, coded voice packets are transmitted from<br>
the MGw1 64 to the PDSN 32, and transmitted from the PD BSC 34 over the air interface to<br>
the hybrid AT/MS 10. Voice packets in the opposite direction follow the reverse path.<br>
As the hybrid AT/MS 10 moves physically further from the radio transceiver resources of the<br>
PD BSC 34, the hybrid AT/MS 10 indicates poor channel conditions to the PD BSC 34, such<br>
as by requesting a lower data rate via a Data Rate Control (DRC) index. When the hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 reports sufficiently poor channel conditions, the PD BSC 34 determines it must<br>
hand off the hybrid AT/MS 10 to another wireless network base station.<br>
If the packet data wireless network 30 is of limited geographic extent, and the hybrid AT/MS<br>
10 is at the edge of its service area, it is likely that the hybrid AT/MS 10 may be served by a<br>
circuit switched wireless network 20, which are more widely deployed. However, the packet<br>
data wireless network 30 and the circuit switched wireless network 20 may not implement<br>
protocols for inter-system handoff.<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, the handoff of a hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 from the packet data wireless network 30 to the circuit switched wireless network<br>
20 is facilitated by having the hybrid AT/MS 10 place a call from its MS side, through the<br>
circuit switched wireless network 20, to its AT side - referred to herein as a loop-back call.<br>
The loop- back call establishes a third communication dialog between the TAS 50 and the MS<br>
9<br><br>
side of the hybrid AT/MS 10 - through the circuit switched wireless network 20 - to which the<br>
first dialog (MGw1 - TAS) of the existing call may be connected, to effect an inter-system<br>
handoff. The second dialog (TAS - AT) may then be dropped. This process is described with<br>
reference to the signal flow diagram of Figure 2, and the flow diagram of Figure 3, wherein<br>
the numbering of method steps and network events is consistent.<br>
As discussed above, the AT/MS 10 is initially engaged in an existing voice call. The TAS 50<br>
is a B2BUA, maintaining a first dialog between the MGw1 64 and the TAS 50, and a second<br>
dialog between the TAS 50 and of the AT side of the AT/MS 10 (block 100). If necessary, the<br>
MS functionality within the AT/MS 10 registers with the circuit switched wireless network<br>
20, according to standard procedures well known in the art (block 102). The MS side of the<br>
AT/MS 10 then initiates a call through the circuit switched wireless network 20, with the<br>
CdPN = TRNpd (block 104). This identifies the call to the network 40 as a loop-back call<br>
used to initiate a handoff.<br>
The MSC 22 places the MDN of the AT/MS 10 in the CgPN field of an Initial Address<br>
Message (IAM) and the sends the IAM to the MGCF2 54 (block 106). The MGCF254<br>
performs an ENUM conversion on the TRNpd to generate a sip:uri PSI AS (block 108).<br>
ENUM is a protocol that converts fully qualified PSTN telephone numbers to fully qualified<br>
IMS URIs. The predetermined value of TRNpd is a reserved telephone number that identifies<br>
a call placed to it as a loop-back call used to effect inter-system handoff. The MGCF2 54<br>
places the sip:uri PSI AS in the R-URI (To) field of a SIP INVITE message, and places the<br>
information from the CgPN field of the IAM (i.e., the MDN) in the P-Asserted ID (verified<br>
From) field of the SIP INVITE message.<br>
The MGCF2 54 sends the SIP INVITE message to the IMS network 40, where it is routed to<br>
the PSI AS 48 (block 110). The PSI AS 48 swaps of the values of the R-URI and P-Asserted<br>
ID fields - that is, the called and calling party identifiers - thus redirecting the call back to the<br>
originating AT/MS 10 (block 112). The PSI AS 48 additionally performs an ENUM<br>
conversion on the MDN, so that the call back to the AT/MS 10 is routed through the packet<br>
data wireless network 30. The PSI AS 48 forwards the modified SIP INVITE message to the<br>
S-CSCF 44 (block 114). A trigger in the S-CSCF 44 causes the SIP INVITE message to be<br>
routed to the TAS 50 (block 116).<br>
10<br><br>
In response to the calling party identifier, that is, the P-Asserted ID header being the PSI AS<br>
48, the TAS 50 recognizes the loop-back call, and creates a third dialog: between the TAS 50<br>
and the MGCF2 54. The TAS 50 sends a SIP 200 OK message containing the Session<br>
Description Protocol (SDP) information for MGw1 66 to the S-CSCF 44 (block 120), which<br>
forwards it to the MGCF2 54 (block 122). The MGCF2 sends a ANswer Message (ANM) to<br>
the MSC 22 (block 124). This establishes the third dialog, through the circuit switched<br>
wireless network 20 (block 126). The MGCF2 54 sends an acknowledge message confirming<br>
the third dialog establishment to the S-CSCF 44 (block 128), which forwards it to the TAS 50<br>
(block 130). The existing call through the packet data wireless network 30 and the loop-back<br>
call through the circuit switched wireless network 20 are depicted in Figure 1 B.<br>
Upon receiving the acknowledgment of the third dialog, the TAS 50 changes the first dialog<br>
(MGw1 - TAS) by sending a SIP UPDATE message that informs the MGCF1 66 to direct the<br>
MGw1 64 to send/receive media from MGw2 54. This SIP UPDATE message is sent to the S-<br>
CSCF 44 (block 132), which forwards it to the MGCF1 66(block 134).<br>
At the same time, the TAS 50 releases the second dialogue (TAS - AT) by routing a BYE<br>
message to the IMS client (the AT side of the AT/MS 10). The TAS 50 sends the BYE<br>
message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 136), which forwards it to the AT/MS 10 (block 138).<br>
Upon receiving the BYE message, the AT side of the AT/MS 10 transfers voice for the<br>
existing call to its MS functionality, transmitting and receiving voice signals through the<br>
circuit switched wireless network 20.<br>
Meanwhile, the MGCF1 66 confirms the update to the existing call by sending a SIP 200 OK<br>
message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 142), which is routed to the TAS 50 (block 144). At this<br>
moment voice is connected between the MGw1 64 and the MGw2 56.<br>
Finally, the IMS client (the AT side of the AT/MS 10), confirms the release of the second<br>
dialogue (TAS - AT) by sending a SIP 200 OK message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 146), which<br>
forwards it to the TAS 50 (block 148). The inter-system handoff is complete, and the AT/MS<br>
10 continues the existing call through the circuit switched wireless network 20, using its MS<br>
functionality. The media plane for the handed off call is depicted in Figure 1 C. Voice signals<br>
11<br><br>
from the PSTN 62 are translated into coded voice packets by the MGwl 64, and travel over<br>
RTP or IP to the MGw2 50. The MGw2 50 translates the coded voice packets to the 64-kbps<br>
PCM format of the circuit switched wireless network 20 backhaul, and transmits the signals to<br>
the MSC 22. The MSC 22 transmits the voice signals to the CS BSC 24, which transmits<br>
them over a dedicated channel to the AT/MS 10. Voice signals in the opposite direction<br>
follow the reverse path.<br>
Circuit Switched Network to Packet Data Network Handoff<br>
Figure 4A depicts a hybrid AT/MS 10 engaged in an existing call with a party in the PSTN 62<br>
through a circuit switched wireless network 20 in a roaming area 12. The circuit switched<br>
wireless network 20 comprises a Visiting MSC (VMSC) 22 and a CS BSC 24. Also within<br>
the roaming area 12 is a packet data wireless network 30 comprising a PDSN 32 and a PD<br>
BSC 34. The packet data wireless network 30 is connected to an IMS network 40 via a P-<br>
CSCF 52. The IMS network 40 includes one or more AS 42, a S-CSCF 44, a I-CSCF 46, a<br>
TAS 50, and a MGCF 54 controlling a MGw 56. All of the IMS network 40 components are<br>
described above.<br>
The MGCF 54 maintains a ISUP signaling connection to a Gateway MSC (GMSC) 58, which<br>
is in the home area of the circuit switched wireless network 20. The GMSC 58 is connected to<br>
a Home Location Register (HLR) 60 and a Service Control Point (SCP) 61. The GMSC 58<br>
additionally maintains connections to other network nodes, such as the PSTN 62.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4A, and depicted in the signal diagram of Figure 5 and the flow<br>
diagram of Figure 6 (wherein method steps and network signaling are numbered consistently),<br>
the AT/MS 10 is engaged in an existing call, utilizing its MS functionality, through the circuit<br>
switched wireless network 20 (block 150). Voice signals travel from a telephone in the PSTN<br>
62, through the GMSC 58 in the home area, through the MSC 22 in the roaming area, and are<br>
transmitted to the AT/MS 10 on a dedicated channel over the circuit-switched air interface by<br>
the CS BSC 24. Voice signals in the opposite direction followed the reverse path.<br>
As the AT/MS 10 moves physically further from the radio transceivers of the CS BSC 24, a<br>
handoff to the packet data wireless network 30 may become necessary. According to one or<br>
12<br><br>
more embodiments of the present invention, such a handoff may be facilitated by the hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 placing a loop-back call from its AT functionality, through the packet data<br>
wireless network 30, to its MS functionality. This establishes a call dialogue through the<br>
packet data wireless network 30, to which the existing call may be connected. By then<br>
disconnecting the call through the circuit-switched wireless network 20, the AT/MS 10 will<br>
have defected and inter- system handoff.<br>
If necessary, the AT side of the AT/MS 10 registers with the IMS network 40 through the<br>
packet data wireless network 30 (block 152). The AT and initiates a call through the packet<br>
data wireless network 30 by issuing a SIP INVITE message to the S-CSCF 44, with CgPN =<br>
MDN and CdPN = TRNcs (block 154). In response to a trigger, the S-CSCF 44 forwards the<br>
SIP INVITE message to the TAS 50 (block 156).<br>
In response to recognizing the TRNcs, the TAS 50 identifies the call request as a loop- back<br>
call for a inter-system handoff. The TAS 50 thus knows to route the call through the circuit-<br>
switched wireless network 20 (block 158). The TAS 50 generates a SIP INVITE message<br>
with CgPN = MDN, CdPN = TRNcs, and ROUTE = MGCF and sends the SIP INVITE<br>
message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 160), which forwards it to the MGCF 54 (block 162). The<br>
MGCF 54 generates an Initial Address Message (IAM) with the appropriate called and calling<br>
party identifiers, and sends the IAM to the GMSC 58 (block 164).<br>
According to normal circuit switched network roaming procedures, the GMSC 58 accesses<br>
the HLR 42 ascertained the location of the called party (TRNcs). A fictitious subscriber entry<br>
in the HLR 40, having the MDN = TRNcs, includes Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) data<br>
specified in such a way that it directs of the GMSC 58 to a particular Service Control Point<br>
(SCP) 61. When the GMSC 58 accesses the SCP 61, the SCP 61 identifies the loop-back call<br>
as part of an inter-system handoff by recognizing the TRNcs as the called party identifier. The<br>
SCP 61 swaps the called and calling party identifiers, thus routing the loop-back call to the<br>
originating AT/MS 10. The SCP 61 then directs the GMSC 58 to continue with the call setup.<br>
The GMSC 58 notes that the CdPN has changed, interprets this as a "forwarded call," and re-<br>
accesses the HLR 60 to ascertain the location of the called party (now the MDN) (block 166).<br>
13<br><br>
The GMSC 58 locates the AT/MS 10, and sends an IAM signal to the VMSC 22 (block 168).<br>
The VMSC 22, aware that the AT/MS 10 is engaged in the existing voice call, sends a Call<br>
Waiting signal to the AT/MS 10 (block 170). The AT/MS 10 recognizes the loop-back call<br>
(by inspection of the CgPN = TRNcs), suppresses any Call Waiting alert that would normally<br>
be issued to the user, and accepts the call (block 172). At this point, the loop-back call from<br>
the AT side through the packet data wireless network 32 the MS side of the AT/MS 10 is<br>
established (block 174), as depicted in Figure 4B.<br>
The AT/MS 10 sends a JOIN command through the circuit switched wireless network 20,<br>
directing the existing call to connect to the loop-back call through the packet data wireless<br>
network 30 (block 176). The leg of the loop-back call to the circuit-switched wireless network<br>
20 is disconnected, effecting an inter-system handoff of the AT/MS 10 from the circuit<br>
switched wireless network 20 to the packet data wireless network 30, as depicted in Figure<br>
4C. Voice signals travel from a telephone in the PSTN 62 to the MGw 56. The MGw 56<br>
converts the voice into coded voice packets which are transmitted over RTP or IP to the<br>
PDSN 32. The PD BSC 34 then transmits voice packets over a shared channel to the AT side<br>
of the AT/MS 10. Voice in the opposite direction follow the reverse path.<br>
Although the present invention has been described herein with respect to particular features,<br>
aspects and embodiments thereof, it will be apparent that numerous variations, modifications,<br>
and other embodiments are possible within the broad scope of the present invention, and<br>
accordingly, all variations, modifications and embodiments are to be regarded as being within<br>

SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CALL HANDOFF BETWEEN CIRCUIT SWITCHED AND PACKET<br>
SWITCHED DATA WIRELESS NETWORKS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/643,625 filed<br>
January 13, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of communication networks and in<br>
particular to a system and method for handing off a call between circuit switched and packet<br>
data wireless networks.<br>
The emerging technology for core networks in wireless communication systems is a<br>
packet-based, all-IP network. For example, the IP Multimedia System (IMS) is a open industry<br>
standard architecture for telecom operators to provide voice and multimedia communication<br>
services. The IMS network runs over the standard Internet Protocol (IP), providing both Voice<br>
over IP (VoIP) and data services, including audio and video broadcast or streaming,<br>
videoconferencing, games, filesharing, e-mail, and the like. The IMS network supports both<br>
packet data wireless networks, such as CDMA 1x EV-DO, WLAN (WiFi), WiMAX, WCDMA,<br>
HSPDA, and the like, as well as circuit switched wireless networks, such as CDMA 1x, GSM,<br>
and WCDMA.<br>
While the migration toward packet data networks is expected to continue, circuit<br>
switched wireless communication networks are widely deployed and heavily used. A<br>
heterogeneous mix of a circuit switched and packet data wireless networks will exist in the field<br>
for years to come.<br>
Mobility management is a key aspect of wireless communication systems, necessary to<br>
maintain communications with mobile terminals as users move throughout different geographic<br>
areas. Mobile Assisted Hand-Off (MAHO) is a well-known element of mobility management. In<br>
MAHO, mobile terminals report channel conditions, desired data rates, pilot strengths signals<br>
from neighboring radio base stations, and the like to a serving base station, which, using this<br>
information as well as the relative loading among neighboring base stations, determines if,<br>
when, and to which base station to hand off a mobile terminal. Intra-system handoff is a<br>
fundamental operational aspect of any wireless communication system.<br>
Inter-system handoff, however, may be problematic for several reasons. First, mobile<br>
terminals must be developed and deployed to that are capable of engaging in communications<br>
with both circuit switched and packet data wireless networks. Additionally, in most deployments,<br>
circuit switched and packet data wireless networks operate in different frequency bands. Hybrid<br>
mobile terminals exist which can operate in both frequency bands simultaneously; however soft<br>
inter-system handoff is impossible due to the different radio technologies used. Additionally,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
network protocols in the circuit switched and packet data systems do not directly support inter-<br>
system handoff.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one or more embodiments, the present invention relates to handing off a hybrid<br>
mobile terminal between packet data and circuit switched wireless networks. The hybrid mobile<br>
terminal is engaged in an existing call through a serving one of the wireless networks. The<br>
mobile terminal places a new call through the target one of the wireless networks, the new call<br>
having a predetermined called party identifier. In response to the called party identifier, the call<br>
Is converted to a loop-back call directed to the mobile terminal through the serving wireless<br>
network, establishing a call path through the target wireless network. The mobile terminal<br>
accepts the loop-back call, and directs the existing call to connect to the call path through the<br>
target wireless network. The existing call through the original network is then dropped.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of hand off from a serving<br>
one of a packet data or circuit switched wireless network to a target one of the networks, for a<br>
hybrid mobile terminal capable of communications through both networks and engaged in an<br>
existing call through the serving wireless networks. A new call is received from the mobile<br>
terminal through the target wireless network, the new call having a predetermined called party<br>
identifier. In response to the called party identifier, the new call is routed back to the mobile<br>
terminal through the serving wireless network. The existing call is connected to the mobile<br>
terminal through the target wireless network.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of handing off a hybrid<br>
mobile terminal, operative to communicate through both packet data and circuit switched<br>
wireless networks, from a serving one of such networks initially carrying an existing call to a<br>
target one of such networks. A new call, having a predetermined called party identifier, is<br>
generated through the target wireless network. A loop-back call is accepted through the serving<br>
wireless network. In response to the loop-back call, the existing call is continued through the<br>
target wireless.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a circuit switched wireless<br>
network, including a subscriber database maintaining a plurality of subscriber profiles and at<br>
least one fictitious subscriber profile having a predetermined Mobile Directory Number (MDN)<br>
and identifying a call directed to the predetermined MDN as a handoff loop-back call. The<br>
circuit switched wireless network also includes a network node operative to redirect a handoff<br>
loop-back call to the mobile terminal that originated the call.<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention relates to a packet data wireless<br>
network, including a Public Service Identifier Application Server (PSI-AS) operative to redirect a<br>
handoff loop-back call to the mobile terminal that originated the call. The packet data wireless<br>
network also includes a network node operative to receive a Initial Address Message (IAM) from<br>
a circuit switched wireless network, the IAM having a predetermined MDN as the called party<br>

WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
identifier, and further operative to convert the called party identifier from the predetermined<br>
MDN to the sip:uri address of the PSI-AS.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one or more embodiments, the present invention relates to a system and method of<br>
handing off a hybrid mobile terminal between packet data and circuit switched wireless<br>
networks. As used herein, a hybrid mobile terminal refers to a mobile device having the radio<br>
transceivers, functionality, and if necessary the authorization, to engage in voice and/or data<br>
communications with both a packet data wireless network and a circuit switched wireless<br>
network. Due to different operating frequencies and a lack of protocols between the networks<br>
themselves, it is not currently possible to hand off an existing call from one network to the other,<br>
such as may become necessary if the hybrid mobile terminal moves from a geographic area<br>
served by one network into an area served by the other.<br>
Any new handoff method should work equally well in either direction. That is, it must<br>
provide for handoff from a packet data wireless network to a circuit switched wireless network,<br>
as well as from the circuit switched to the packet data wireless network. In the following<br>
discussion, the "serving" wireless network is the network through which an existing call is routed<br>
to the hybrid mobile terminal, and may be either a packet data or a circuit switched wireless<br>
network. The "target" wireless network is the other network, through which the call will be<br>
connected following the handoff procedure.<br>
One way to establish a call path through the target wireless network is for the<br>
corresponding functionality in the mobile terminal to place a call through the target wireless<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
network to its functionality corresponding to the serving network. The existing call may<br>
subsequently be connected to the newly established call path. That is, the packet data side of<br>
the hybrid mobile terminal places a call to the circuit switched side of the same hybrid mobile<br>
terminal, or vice versa. Such a call is referred to herein as a loop-back call.<br>
However, most existing networks interpret a call to the originator - that is, a call where<br>
the Calling Party Number (CgPN) and the Called Party Number (CdPN) are the same - as a call<br>
to access the user's voicemail box. Thus, to work within existing networks, the CgPN and the<br>
CdPN must be different. In circuit switched wireless networks, the Mobile Directory Number<br>
(MDN) of the hybrid mobile terminal is inserted into the Initial Address Message (IAM) as the<br>
CgPN (also referred to as the A-Number) by the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) serving the<br>
mobile terminal, as part of the Line Identification functionality. Accordingly, altering the CgPN is<br>
not an option.<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a loop-back call is<br>
established by a hybrid mobile terminal placing a call having a Transfer Routing Number (TRN)<br>
as the CdPN. A unique TRN is defined for each network: TRNpd for the packet data wireless<br>
network and TRNcs for the circuit switched wireless network. When a (target) network receives<br>
a call request from a hybrid mobile terminal where the CdPN is the TRN for that network (and<br>
the CgPN = MDN), the network recognizes the call as a loop-back call, and routes the call back<br>
to the hybrid mobile terminal through the other (serving) wireless network. This may be<br>
accomplished, for example, by swapping the called and calling party identifiers (i.e., CgPN =<br>
TRN and CdPN = MDN), and routing the calf to the serving wireless network.<br>
The call arrives at the hybrid mobile terminal through the serving wireless network. The<br>
hybrid mobile terminal recognizes the loop-back call by virtue of the TRN and/or MDN. The<br>
hybrid mobile terminal accepts the call, and transfers the existing call to its functionality<br>
associated with the target wireless network. The serving wireless network (or the hybrid mobile<br>
terminal) may then connect the existing call to the call path established through the target<br>
wireless network, and drop the leg of the existing call through the serving wireless network,<br>
effectively handing off the call from the serving to the target wireless network.<br>
Packet Data Network to Circuit Switched Network Handoff<br>
Figure 1 depicts a hybrid mobile terminal 10, comprising both packet data wireless<br>
network Access Terminal (AT) and circuit switched wireless network Mobile Station (MS)<br>
functionality. The hybrid AT/MS 10 is in a Roaming Area 12, in which a circuit switched wireless<br>
network 20 and a packet data wireless network 30 are operative.<br>
The circuit switched wireless network 20 comprises a Mobile Switching Center (MSC)<br>
22, connected to one or more circuit switched Base Station Controllers (CS BSC) 24 providing<br>
communication services to one or more mobile stations (not shown). The MSC 22 routes voice<br>
and data over circuit switched network connections between the CS BSC 24 and numerous<br>
other network nodes (not shown). The CS BSC 24 includes or controls one or more radio base<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
stations or base station transceivers (not shown) that include the transceiver resources<br>
necessary to support radio communication with mobile stations, such as<br>
modulators/demodulators, baseband processors, radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers,<br>
antennas, and the like.<br>
The packet data wireless network 30 comprises a Packet Data Switching Node (PDSN)<br>
32 connected to one or more packet data Base Station Controllers (PD BSC) 34 providing<br>
packet data communication services to one or more access terminals, such as the AT side of<br>
hybrid AT/MS 10. The PDSN 32 routes data packets between the PD BSC 34 and other packet<br>
data networks, such as an IP Media System (IMS) network 40. The PD BSC 34 includes or<br>
controls one or more radio base stations similar to the CS BSC 24, but provides packet data<br>
communications on shared, high-bandwidth channels to ATs.<br>
Both wireless networks 20,30 are connected to an IMS network 40. The IMS is a<br>
general-purpose, open industry standard for voice and multimedia communications over packet-<br>
based IP networks 40. The IMS network 40 includes one or more Application Servers (AS) 42<br>
providing various services (audio and video broadcast or streaming, push-to-talk,<br>
videoconferencing, games, filesharing, e-mail, and the like). In particular, a Telephony AS<br>
(TAS) 50 provides telephonic communications services, as described in more detail herein.<br>
Another AS within the IMS 40 is a Public Service Identifier (PSI) AS 46. The PSI AS 48 is a<br>
generic AS that handles session transfer between IP connectivity points for a specific terminal.<br>
The PSI AS 46 handles inter-system handoffs within a system.<br>
Communications between nodes within the IMS network 40 utilize the Session Initiation<br>
Protocol (SIP). SIP is a signaling protocol for Internet conferencing, telephony, presence,<br>
events notification, instant messaging, and the like. SIP uses a long-term stable identifier, the<br>
SIP Universal Resource Indicator (URI).<br>
The PSI-AS 48 and TAS 50 are connected to a Serving-Call Session Control Function<br>
(S-CSCF) 44. The S-CSCF 44 initiates, manages, and terminates multimedia sessions<br>
between IMS 40 terminals. The S-CSCF 44 may be connected to an optional Interrogating-<br>
CSCF (I-CSCF) 48. The I-CSCF 48 is a SIP proxy located at the edge of an administrative<br>
domain. The I-CSCF (or S-CSCF if a I-CSCF is not present) is connected to a Proxy-CSCF (P-<br>
CSCF) 52. The P-CSCF 52 is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact to the IMS 40.<br>
Both the PSDN 32 of the packet data wireless network 30 and a Media Gateway Control<br>
Function (MGFC2) 54 maintain SIP connections to the P-CSCF 52. The MGCF2 54 controls a<br>
media gateway (MGw2) 56, connected to the MSC 22 of the circuit switched wireless network 20<br>
via a dedicated handoff trunk. The MGCF2 54 maintains a ISUP connection to the MSC 22.<br>
Figure 1A depicts the hybrid AT/MS 10 engaged in a voice call with a party in the Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 62. The PSTN 62 is connected to the IMS network 40 by<br>
a PSTN interface 60 including a MGCF1 66 controlling a MGw1 64. The MGw1 64 is connected<br>
to the PSTN 62 over a time division multiplexed (TDM) link. The MGw1 64 translates coded<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
voice packets or circuit switched 64-kbps Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) voice signals from the<br>
PTSN 62 to coded voice packets, such as for example Enhanced Variable Rate CODEC<br>
(EVRC) packets, which are then transmitted via Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) or Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) to other nodes in the IMS network 40.<br>
The call depicted in Figure 1A was set up by, and is maintained by, the TAS 50. The<br>
TAS 50 serves as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA). A B2BUA is a SIP based logical entity<br>
that can receive and process SIP INVITE messages as a SIP User Agent Server (UAS). The<br>
B2BUA also acts as a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) that determines how the request should be<br>
answered and how to initiate outbound calls. Unlike a SIP proxy server, the B2BUA maintains<br>
complete call state and participates in all call requests. In particular, for the call of Figure 1 A,<br>
the B2BUA controls two SIP dialogs: a first dialog between the MGCF1 66 and the TAS 50; and<br>
a second dialog between the TAS 50 and the AT (IMS client) side of the hybrid AT/MS 10. In<br>
the media plane or user plane, coded voice packets are transmitted from the MGw1 64 to the<br>
PDSN 32, and transmitted from the PD BSC 34 over the air interface to the hybrid AT/MS 10.<br>
Voice packets in the opposite direction follow the reverse path.<br>
As the hybrid AT/MS 10 moves physically further from the radio transceiver resources of<br>
the PD BSC 34, the hybrid AT/MS 10 indicates poor channel conditions to the PD BSC 34, such<br>
as by requesting a lower data rate via a Data Rate Control (DRC) index. When the hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 reports sufficiently poor channel conditions, the PD BSC 34 determines it must hand<br>
off the hybrid AT/MS 10 to another wireless network base station.<br>
If the packet data wireless network 30 is of limited geographic extent, and the hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 is at the edge of its service area, it is likely that the hybrid AT/MS 10 may be served<br>
by a circuit switched wireless network 20, which are more widely deployed. However, the<br>
packet data wireless network 30 and the circuit switched wireless network 20 may not<br>
implement protocols for inter-system handoff;<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, the handoff of a hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 from the packet data wireless network 30 to the circuit switched wireless network 20<br>
is facilitated by having the hybrid AT/MS 10 place a call from its MS side, through the circuit<br>
switched wireless network 20, to its AT side - referred to herein as a loop-back call. The loop-<br>
back call establishes a third communication dialog between the TAS 50 and the MS side of the<br>
hybrid AT/MS 10 -through the circuit switched wireless network 20 -to which the first dialog<br>
(MGw1 - TAS) of the existing call may be connected, to effect an inter-system handoff. The<br>
second dialog (TAS -AT) may then be dropped. This process is described with reference to<br>
the signal flow diagram of Figure 2, and the flow diagram of Figure 3, wherein the numbering of<br>
method steps and network events is consistent.<br>
As discussed above, the AT/MS 10 is initially engaged in an existing voice call. The<br>
TAS 50 is a B2BUA, maintaining a first dialog between the MGw1 64 and the TAS 50, and a<br>
second dialog between the TAS 50 and of the AT side of the AT/MS 10 (block 100). If<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
necessary, the MS functionality within the AT/MS 10 registers with the circuit switched wireless<br>
network 20, according to standard procedures well known in the art (block 102). The MS side of<br>
the AT/MS 10 then initiates a call through the circuit switched wireless network 20, with the<br>
CdPN = TRNpd (block 104). This identifies the call to the network 40 as a loop-back call used<br>
to initiate a handoff.<br>
The MSC 22 places the MDN of the AT/MS 10 in the CgPN field of an Initial Address<br>
Message (IAM) and the sends the IAM to the MGCF2 54 (block 106). The MGCF2 54 performs<br>
an ENUM conversion on the TRNpd to generate a sip:uri PSI AS (block 108). ENUM is a<br>
protocol that converts fully qualified PSTN telephone numbers to fully qualified IMS URIs. The<br>
predetermined value of TRNpd is a reserved telephone number that identifies a call placed to it<br>
as a loop-back call used to effect inter-system handoff. The MGCF2 54 places the sip:uri PSI<br>
AS in the R-URI (To) field of a SIP INVITE message, and places the information from the CgPN<br>
field of the IAM (i.e., the MDN) in the P-Asserted ID (verified From) field of the SIP INVITE<br>
message.<br>
The MGCF2 54 sends the SIP INVITE message to the IMS network 40, where it is routed<br>
to the PSI AS 48 (block 110). The PSI AS 48 swaps of the values of the R-URI and P-Asserted<br>
ID fields - that is, the called and calling party identifiers - thus redirecting the call back to the<br>
originating AT/MS 10 (block 112). The PSI AS 48 additionally performs an ENUM conversion<br>
on the MDN, so that the call back to the AT/MS 10 is routed through the packet data wireless<br>
network 30. The PSI AS 48 forwards the modified SIP INVITE message to the S-CSCF 44<br>
(block 114). A trigger in the S-CSCF 44 causes the SIP INVITE message to be routed to the<br>
TAS 50 (block 116).<br>
In response to the calling party identifier, that is, the P-Asserted ID header being the PSI<br>
AS 48, the TAS 50 recognizes the loop-back call, and creates a third dialog: between the TAS<br>
50 and the MGCF2 54. The TAS 50 sends a SIP 200 OK message containing the Session<br>
Description Protocol (SDP) information for MGw1 66 to the S-CSCF 44 (block 120), which<br>
forwards it to the MGCF2 54 (block 122). The MGCF2 sends a ANswer Message (ANM) to the<br>
MSC 22 (block 124). This establishes the third dialog, through the circuit switched wireless<br>
network 20 (block 126). The MGCF2 54 sends an acknowledge message confirming the third<br>
dialog establishment to the S-CSCF 44 (block 128), which forwards it to the TAS 50 (block 130).<br>
The existing call through the packet data wireless network 30 and the loop-back call through the<br>
circuit switched wireless network 20 are depicted in Figure 1B.<br>
Upon receiving the acknowledgment of the third dialog, the TAS 50 changes the first<br>
dialog (MGw1 - TAS) by sending a SIP UPDATE message that informs the MGCF1 66 to direct<br>
the MGW1 64 to send/receive media from MGw2 54. This SIP UPDATE message is sent to the<br>
S-CSCF 44 (block 132), which forwards it to the MGC1 66(block 134).<br>
At the same time, the TAS 50 releases the second dialogue (TAS - AT) by routing a BYE<br>
message to the IMS client (the AT side of the AT/MS 10). The TAS 50 sends the BYE message<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
to the S-CSCF 44 (block 136), which forwards it to the AT/MS 10 (block 138). Upon receiving<br>
the BYE message, the AT side of the AT/MS 10 transfers voice for the existing call to its MS<br>
functionality, transmitting and receiving voice signals through the circuit switched wireless<br>
network 20.<br>
Meanwhile, the MGCF1 66 confirms the update to the existing call by sending a SIP 200<br>
OK message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 142), which is routed to the TAS 50 (block 144). At this<br>
moment voice is connected between the MGw1 64 and the MGw2 56.<br>
Finally, the IMS client (the AT side of the AT/MS 10), confirms the release of the second<br>
dialogue (TAS - AT) by sending a SIP 200 OK message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 146), which<br>
forwards it to the TAS 50 (block 148). The inter-system handoff is complete, and the AT/MS 10<br>
continues the existing call through the circuit switched wireless network 20, using its MS<br>
functionality. The media plane for the handed off call is depicted in Figure 1C. Voice signals<br>
from the PSTN 62 are translated into coded voice packets by the MGw1 64, and travel over<br>
RTP or IP to the MGw2 50. The MGw2 50 translates the coded voice packets to the 64-kbps<br>
PCM format of the circuit switched wireless network 20 backhaul, and transmits the signals to<br>
the MSC 22. The MSC 22 transmits the voice signals to the CS BSC 24, which transmits them<br>
over a dedicated channel to the AT/MS 10. Voice signals in the opposite direction follow the<br>
reverse path.<br>
Circuit Switched Network to Packet Data Network Handoff<br>
Figure 4A depicts a hybrid AT/MS 10 engaged in an existing call with a party in the<br>
PSTN 62 through a circuit switched wireless network 20 in a roaming area 12. The circuit<br>
switched wireless network 20 comprises a Visiting MSC (VMSC) 22 and a CS BSC 24. Also<br>
within the roaming area 12 is a packet data wireless network 30 comprising a PDSN 32 and a<br>
PD BSC 34. The packet data wireless network 30 is connected to an IMS network 40 via a P-<br>
CSCF 52. The IMS network 40 includes one or more AS 42, a S-CSCF 44, a I-CSCF 46, a TAS<br>
50, and a MGCF 54 controlling a MGw 56. All of the IMS network 40 components are described<br>
above.<br>
The MGCF 54 maintains a ISUP signaling connection to a Gateway MSC (GMSC) 58,<br>
which is in the home area of the circuit switched wireless network 20. The GMSC 58 is<br>
connected to a Home Location Register (HLR) 60 and a Service Control Point (SCP) 61. The<br>
GMSC 58 additionally maintains connections to other network nodes, such as the PSTN 62.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4A, and depicted in the signal diagram of Figure 5 and the flow<br>
diagram of Figure 6 (wherein method steps and network signaling are numbered consistently),<br>
the AT/MS 10 is engaged in an existing call, utilizing its MS functionality, through the circuit<br>
switched wireless network 20 (block 150). Voice signals travel from a telephone in the PSTN<br>
62, through the GMSC 58 in the home area, through the MSC 22 in the roaming area, and are<br>
transmitted to the AT/MS 10 on a dedicated channel over the circuit-switched air interface by<br>
the CS BSC 24. Voice signals in the opposite direction followed the reverse path.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
As the AT/MS 10 moves physically further from the radio transceivers of the CS BSC 24,<br>
a handoff to the packet data wireless network 30 may become necessary. According to one or<br>
more embodiments of the present invention, such a handoff may be facilitated by the hybrid<br>
AT/MS 10 placing a loop-back call from its AT functionality, through the packet data wireless<br>
network 30, to its MS functionality. This establishes a call dialogue through the packet data<br>
wireless network 30, to which the existing call may be connected. By then disconnecting the<br>
call through the circuit-switched wireless network 20, the AT/MS 10 will have defected and inter-<br>
system handoff.<br>
If necessary, the AT side of the AT/MS 10 registers with the IMS network 40 through the<br>
packet data wireless network 30 (block 152). The AT and initiates a call through the packet<br>
data wireless network 30 by issuing a SIP INVITE message to the S-CSCF 44, with CgPN =<br>
MDN and CdPN = TRNcs (block 154). In response to a trigger, the S-CSCF 44 forwards the<br>
SIP INVITE message to the TAS 50 (block 156).<br>
In response to recognizing the TRNcs, the TAS 50 identifies the call request as a loop-<br>
back call for a inter-system handoff. The TAS 50 thus knows to route the call through the<br>
circuit-switched wireless network 20 (block 158). The TAS 50 generates a SIP INVITE<br>
message with CgPN = MDN, CdPN = TRNcs, and ROUTE = MGCF and sends the SIP INVITE<br>
message to the S-CSCF 44 (block 160), which forwards it to the MGCF 54 (block 162). The<br>
MGCF 54 generates an Initial Address Message (IAM) with the appropriate called and calling<br>
party identifiers, and sends the IAM to the GMSC 58 (block 164).<br>
According to normal circuit switched network roaming procedures, the GMSC 58<br>
accesses the HLR 42 ascertained the location of the called party (TRNcs). A fictitious<br>
subscriber entry in the HLR 40, having the MDN = TRNcs, Includes Wireless Intelligent Network<br>
(WIN) data specified in such a way that it directs of the GMSC 58 to a particular Service Control<br>
Point (SCP) 61. When the GMSC 58 accesses the SCP 61, the SCP 61 identifies the loop-back<br>
call as part of an inter-system handoff by recognizing the TRNcs as the called party identifier.<br>
The SCP 61 swaps the called and calling party identifiers, thus routing the loop-back call to the<br>
originating AT/MS 10. The SCP 61 then directs the GMSC 58 to continue with the call setup.<br>
The GMSC 58 notes that the CdPN has changed, interprets this as a "forwarded call," and re-<br>
accesses the HLR 60 to ascertain the location of the called party (now the MDN) (block 166).<br>
The GMSC 58 locates the AT/MS 10, and sends an IAM signal to the VMSC 22 (block<br>
168). The VMSC 22, aware that the AT/MS 10 is engaged in the existing voice call, sends a<br>
Call Waiting signal to the AT/MS 10 (block 170). The AT/MS 10 recognizes the loop-back call<br>
(by inspection of the CgPN = TRNcs), suppresses any Call Waiting alert that would normally be<br>
issued to the user, and accepts the call (block 172). At this point, the loop-back call from the AT<br>
side through the packet data wireless network 32 the MS side of the AT/MS 10 is established<br>
(block 174), as depicted in Figure 4B.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/076421	PCT/US2006/000960<br>
The AT/MS 10 sends a JOIN command through the circuit switched wireless network 20,<br>
directing the existing call to connect to the loop-back call through the packet data wireless<br>
network 30 (block 176). The leg of the loop-back call to the circuit-switched wireless network 20<br>
is disconnected, effecting an inter-system handoff of the AT/MS 10 from the circuit switched<br>
wireless network 20 to the packet data wireless network 30, as depicted in Figure 4C. Voice<br>
signals travel from a telephone in the PSTN 62 to the MGw 56. The MGw 56 converts the voice<br>
into coded voice packets which are transmitted over RTP or IP to the PDSN 32. The PD BSC<br>
34 then transmits voice packets over a shared channel to the AT side of the AT/MS 10. Voice in<br>
the opposite direction follow the reverse path.<br>
Although the present invention has been described herein with respect to particular<br>
features, aspects and embodiments thereof, it will be apparent that numerous variations,<br>
modifications, and other embodiments are possible within the broad scope of the present<br>
invention, and accordingly, all variations, modifications and embodiments are to be regarded as<br>
being within the scope of the invention. The present embodiments are therefore to be<br>
construed in all aspects as illustrative and not restrictive and all changes coming within the<br>
meaning and equivalency range of the appended claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>
