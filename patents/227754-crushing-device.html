				<td>Crushing device<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a crushing device for<br>
crushing products of all types, consisting of at least<br>
one rotor, on the periphery of which hooks are mounted,<br>
and at least one stator.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Such machines are used for crushing products of<br>
all types, in particular in the disposal, processing<br>
and recycling of wastes and useful materials.<br>
The material introduced into the crushing<br>
device is contacted by the hooks of at least one rotor,<br>
pulled downwards in the direction of material flow and,<br>
by cooperation with a stator, torn, shredded, crushed,<br>
cut and/or squashed, depending on the type of crushing<br>
device.<br>
Crushing machines can be hydraulically driven<br>
and are provided with the known devices for automatic<br>
change of direction of rotation to clockwise or<br>
counterclockwise operation.<br>
The choice of suitable crushing machines with<br>
regard to drive, size, number of and equipment with<br>
rotors and stators is effected according to the<br>
required<br>
throughput,<br>
particle size of the crushed material, and<br>
life.<br>
A problem of such crushing devices is the wear<br>
of the hooks and of the stator, depending on the<br>
material to be crushed. Because of the wear, the spaces<br>
between the crushing elements increase, with the result<br><br>
that the efficiency of the crushing decreases due to<br>
the wear. The replacement of worn elements is very<br>
expensive and time-consuming.<br>
WO 00/44499 discloses a crushing device in<br>
which U-shaped disc segments are inverted, for<br>
protection against wear, over the crushing elements of<br>
the rotor which are in the form of hooks.<br>
The Laid-Open Application JP 2001-149806A<br>
discloses a two-axis breaking machine - in particular<br>
for industrial wastes - in which the crushing is<br>
effected by breaking blades which are arranged on two<br>
shafts and have a shears-like action. Secondary<br>
additional crushing is effected by downstream,<br>
stationary blades whose distance from the shafts is<br>
adjustable in order to be able to compensate wear and<br>
adjust the particle size. The empty space between the<br>
individual breaking blades is small, and the actual<br>
crushing therefore takes place mainly through the<br>
interaction of the rotors - in particular via the back<br>
edges of the breaking blades which are difficult to<br>
process or replace - and said rotors are therefore<br>
exposed to considerable wear. Smaller parts, which,<br>
owing to their small size, would not have to be<br>
crushed, are likewise contacted and cause additional<br>
wear.<br>
DE 106 19 411 describes a processing machine<br>
for minerals, in which the crushing is effected by two<br>
toothed rolls, the teeth of which are arranged at a<br>
radial distance from one another. The final particles<br>
are forced by the teeth of the two toothed rolls<br>
additionally through a comb-like, flexibly mounted die<br>
and are thus further crushed. In the die, cutting,<br>
breaking and tearing take place at three edges of the<br><br>
teeth. The spaces between the teeth and the die have only a<br>
small amount of empty spaces, so that, in this machine too,<br>
small parts not necessarily to be crushed are contacted and<br>
cause wear. The teeth of the toothed rolls, which are<br>
difficult to repair, are subject to particular wear by the<br>
first crushing process and the subsequent forcing through<br>
the dies.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a<br>
crushing device in which the wear of the crushing elements<br>
is both small and can be compensated without dismantling<br>
and the associated down times. This object is achieved for<br>
the first time in a surprising manner, inter alia, by the<br>
features as described hereinafter.<br>
The present invention also provides a crushing device<br>
for crushing material, with at least one rotor rotating<br>
around a rotor axis, on the circumference of which a<br>
plurality of hooks are located along the rotor axis at a<br>
distance from one another for grabbing and carrying away<br>
the material in a material flow direction, and at least one<br>
stator on which a plurality of crushing elements located in<br>
a co-operating manner with the hooks are fastened, wherein<br>
the stator can be moved either or both in the direction<br>
toward the rotor axis and in the direction of the rotor<br>
axis, and, on the other hand, can be twisted around a<br>
stator axis and rotated through a certain angle so that a<br>
worn side of the stator is replaced by an unused side of<br>
the stator.<br><br>
In achieving the object, the invention starts from the<br>
basic concept that, on the one hand, a special arrangement<br>
of the hooks on the rotor and of the crushing elements on<br>
the stator leads to little wear and, on the other hand, the<br>
spaces between the hook of the rotor nd the stator which<br>
are enlarged by the wear can be compensated if, on the one<br>
hand, the stator is offset in the direction of the rotor<br>
axis and/or in the direction of the rotor axis [sic] and,<br>
on the other hand, the stator is rotated through a certain<br>
angle so that a worn side of the stator is replaced by an<br>
unused side of the stator.<br>
The invention has the advantage that, through the<br>
above-mentioned measures, the life of the crushing<br>
device according to the invention is increased several<br>
times over without dismantling of the crushing<br><br>
elements. Owing to the adjustability of the position of the<br>
stator relative to the rotor, throughput and particle size<br>
can additionally be regulated.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention is to be explained in more detail<br>
below.<br>
In the comminuting device according to the<br>
invention, the material fed. in is contacted by the<br>
hooks of at least one rotor, pulled downwards in the<br>
direction of material flow and torn, shredded, broken,<br>
cut and/or squashed against a stator. The actual<br>
crushing is effected substantially by the cooperation<br>
between hook and stator, since the distances between<br><br>
the rotors and the spaces between the hooks are so<br>
large that only, a slight interaction takes place<br>
between the hooks of the rotors. Since it is therefore<br>
the stator which in particular is fully exposed to the<br>
material flow of the material to be crushed, it is<br>
mainly the stator material which is worn. According to<br>
the invention, moreover, the position of the stator can<br>
be offset in the direction of the rotor axis, - i.e.<br>
the distance from the rotor axis can be reduced -<br>
and/or can be rotated about the stator axis. For<br>
changing the position, the - optionally hydraulic<br>
and/or mechanical - locking of the stator is released.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, after release<br>
of the locking, the stator can additionally be<br>
displaced axially, i.e. in the direction of the rotor<br>
axis.<br>
The displacement of the position of the stator<br>
makes it possible to compensate the wear of the<br>
elements involved in the crushing process - in<br>
particular of the hooks and crushing elements of the<br>
stator - since the gap between the hooks of the rotor<br>
and the crushing elements of the stator, which is<br>
widened by the wear, can be reduced by simply<br>
displacing the stator. Furthermore, the adjustment of<br>
the position of the stator provides an additional<br>
possibility for regulating the throughput and the<br>
particle size.<br>
The adjustment mechanism for displacing the<br>
position of the stator can be formed, for example,<br>
mechanically by screwing to a manually operated<br>
hydraulic cylinder or to an automated - in particular<br>
hydraulic - system.<br>
In the direction of flow of the material to be<br><br>
crushed, the stator is arranged downstream of the<br>
rotor. By means of the special arrangement, according<br>
to the invention, of the hooks on the rotor and of the<br>
stator, the actual crushing takes place substantially<br>
through the cooperation between hook and stator, since<br>
the distances between the rotor axes and the spaces<br>
between the hooks are so large that only little<br>
interaction takes place between the hooks of the<br>
rotors.<br>
The stator can be mounted, for example, below<br>
the rotor, approximately parallel to the rotor shaft,<br>
and can be fastened to the crossbeams of the frame of<br>
the crushing device. If a plurality of rotor shafts are<br>
mounted, the stator is positioned between the rotor<br>
shafts - preferably displaced in a downward direction.<br>
If required, the stator may additionally be protected<br>
by wearing plates.<br>
In addition, the stator can also be arranged on<br>
the frame, to the side of the rotor, optionally between<br>
two hooks, and/or longitudinally, optionally parallel,<br>
to the rotor axis and perpendicular to the hook. Those<br>
stators which in particular perform the function of a<br>
scraper and prevent emergence of the crushed material<br>
in the direction opposite to the direction of<br>
introduction can also be formed so as to be<br>
displaceable in their position. By means of these<br>
stators, the space between the frame and the rotors is<br>
reduced.<br>
At least one fixed crushing element composed of<br>
one or more parts is fastened to the stator. This<br>
element can be mounted on the stator so as to be<br>
replaceable and can optionally be protected by wearing<br>
plates or welded-on parts.<br><br>
The number and arrangement of the crushing<br>
elements on the stator is chosen according to the<br>
function and the arrangement of the hooks on the rotors<br>
and of the desired crushing performance with regard to<br>
the throughput and the particle size.<br>
The particular arrangement of the stator with<br>
the crushing elements in the spaces formed from the<br>
rotors and hooks enables already small-particled<br>
material to fall through, whereas large pieces of<br>
material cannot fall through and are thus crushed.<br>
Through the cooperation of rotor and stator,<br>
throughput and particle size are regulated and, inter<br>
alia, the following effects are achieved:<br>
cleaning of the rotor and the hooks thereof,<br>
additional crushing of the material between rotor<br>
and stator, and<br>
more uniform particle size distribution through<br>
the improved sieve effect.<br>
Since the distances between the rotor axes and<br>
the spaces between the hooks are so large that only<br>
little interaction takes place between the hooks of the<br>
rotors and hence the actual crushing occurs at the<br>
stator, mainly the front edges of the hooks, in<br>
particular in each case a single lateral edge and<br>
possibly a front edge on the front of a hook, and the<br>
breaking edges of the stator, are exposed to wear,<br>
whereas the rear edges of the hooks, which edges are<br>
difficult to repair, experience only slight wear. Small<br>
parts which need not be crushed can fall through and<br>
cause no additional wear. Owing to the larger spaces,<br>
the machine is furthermore more economical and lighter<br>
since it is possible to save material.<br>
The crushing elements on the stator are plate-<br><br>
like and may have a polygonal or disc-shaped<br>
cross-section. The crushing elements preferably have at<br>
least three lateral edges, one of which is oriented<br>
substantially transversely to the direction of flow of<br>
the material to be crushed and cooperates with the<br>
hook. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the<br>
crushing element has four lateral edges and a<br>
substantially orthogonal shape. Owing to this design,<br>
in each case only one edge and one side, or a part of<br>
the edges and sides running round the crushing element,<br>
are involved in the crushing and are effected by the<br>
flow of the material to be crushed and the associated<br>
wear. By rotating the stator about the stator axis, the<br>
edge exposed to wear can be displaced and replaced by<br>
an unworn edge which follows in the circumferential<br>
direction, opposite to the direction of rotation. By<br>
means of this measure according to the invention, the<br>
life of the stator is increased several times over.<br>
The hydraulic system for fixing or locking<br>
and/or displacing the stator can also be used for<br>
protection from overloading. If required, the hydraulic<br>
fixing means for displacement of the stator in the<br>
event of overloading can be adjusted so that, when a<br>
specified load is exceeded, the lock is released and<br>
the stator then moves either axially and/or<br>
transversely to its axis. This is a substantial<br>
simplification compared with the complicated systems<br>
known from the prior art and intended for overload<br>
protection, in which the stators are, for example,<br>
swivelled away in the event of overloading. Optionally,<br>
the hydraulic fixing can engage again as soon as the<br>
overload is terminated.<br>
The individual hooks can be mounted in a<br><br>
replaceable manner on the rotor. In the context of the<br>
invention, "hooks" are understood as meaning the<br>
formations of crushing elements on rotors, which are<br>
known from the prior art and are suitable for<br>
contacting material to be crushed and crushing said<br>
material through at least one cutting, tearing or<br>
breaking effect. This term is intended to include, for<br>
example, rotor discs in the form of a toothed wheel.<br>
Depending on the requirements with regard to<br>
the resistance to wear and material resistance, the<br>
hooks can be equipped with protective elements. Such<br>
protective elements are described, for example, in<br>
WO 00/44499. For example, rotor disc segments having a<br>
U-shape - optionally with extensions for shaft<br>
protection - can be inverted over the hooks.<br>
In machines having a plurality of rotors, the<br>
rotor shafts are arranged approximately parallel to one<br>
another. The opposite hooks on the rotors substantially<br>
parallel to one another are preferably arranged offset<br>
relative to one another, the distance between the rotor<br>
shaft being chosen so that the areas of action of the<br>
hooks opposite to one another overlap only slightly and<br>
intermesh to a small extent.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the<br>
position of the rotor is also displaceable - optionally<br>
hydraulically. For adjusting the rotor, it is possible<br>
to take the same measures as for adjusting the stator.<br>
Below, the figures are described in detail with<br>
examples for embodiments of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows, in cross-section, a crushing<br>
device according to the invention, comprising a frame<br>
which is formed from crossbeams 8 and longitudinal<br>
beams 9. Two rotors 1 in the form of shafts are<br><br>
arranged, substantially parallel to one another, inside<br>
the frame. Hooks 3 are mounted as crushing elements on<br>
the rotors 1. The distance between the rotors 1 is<br>
chosen so that the areas of action of the hooks 3<br>
intermesh only slightly. For crushing, the material is<br>
introduced into the device above the rotors 1 and<br>
contacted by the hooks 3 and can optionally be slightly<br>
crushed beforehand thereby. A bar-like stator 4, at<br>
which the actual crushing process takes place, is<br>
arranged after the hooks 3 in the direction of material<br>
flow, below and between the two rotors 1. The stator 4<br>
which is fixed to prevent rotation is rotatable about<br>
the stator axis 5. Crushing elements 6 having an<br>
orthogonal cross-section are fastened to the stator 4.<br>
The crushing elements 6 are, if required, individually<br>
replaceable. A lateral edge 10a of the crushing element<br>
6 is oriented transversely to the direction of flow of<br>
the material to be crushed. Once the life of the edge<br>
10a has been exceeded, the lock of the stator 4 can be<br>
released and the stator can be rotated through 90Â°,<br>
with the result that the still unworn edge 10b which<br>
follows in the circumferential direction, opposite to<br>
the direction of rotation, is moved so that it is<br>
transverse to the direction of material flow. After<br>
further fixing or locking of the stator 4, the crushing<br>
can be continued. In addition, lateral stators 7 are<br>
mounted on the two longitudinal beams 9, between the<br>
frame and the rotors 1, perpendicular to the rotor axis<br>
2, and are optionally formed so as to be adjustable in<br>
height relative to the rotor axis 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows the crushing device from<br>
Figure 1 in plan view. The crushing elements 6 and the<br>
hooks 3 are arranged on the rotors 1 and the stator 4,<br><br>
axially one behind the other, the hooks 3 of the<br>
rotors 1 arranged parallel to one another and the<br>
crushing elements 6 of the stator being offset relative<br>
to one another so that in each case a crushing element<br>
6 comes to rest between two hooks 3, opposite one<br>
another, of the two rotors 1 parallel to one another.<br>
The lateral distance between the crushing elements 6<br>
and the hooks 3 or the gap between the hooks 3 and the<br>
crushing element 6 can be adjusted by centring the<br>
stator 4 axially relative to the stator axis 5.<br>
Figures 3a and 3b show an example of an<br>
adjusting mechanism for displacing the position of the<br>
stator. Figure 3a shows the stator in a deeper position<br>
"lower" in relation to the rotor. By tightening the<br>
screw 11, the stator axis 5 is displaced in the<br>
direction of the rotor axis and comes to rest in the<br>
"upper", higher position shown in Figure 3b.<br>
Figures 4, 4a and 4b show an example of a<br>
hydraulic adjusting mechanism for displacing the<br>
position of the stator. The position of the stator 4 is<br>
fixed by means of screws 11a in the crossbeams 8. For<br>
displacing the "lower", deeper position of the stator 4<br>
in Figure 4a, the screws 11a are loosened and the<br>
stator 4 is raised by means of a hydraulically driven<br>
piston 12 to the "higher" position shown in Figure 4b,<br>
with the result that the distance between the stator 4<br>
and the rotor 1 is reduced. Thereafter, the stator 4 is<br>
once again fixed in the new position by means of the<br>
screws 11a. The hydraulic adjustment can be effected<br>
both manually and with automatic control.<br>
Figure 5a shows a cross-section and Figure 5b a<br>
plan view of a crushing device according to the<br>
invention, comprising four rotors 1 and three stators<br><br>
4. The frame of the crushing device is formed from the<br>
crossbeams 8 and the longitudinal beams 9. The stators<br>
4 and the rotors 1 are fastened to the crossbeams 8. In<br>
addition, stators 7 fixed in their position can be<br>
arranged directly on the longitudinal beams 9, and/or<br>
stators 7 displaceable in their position can be<br>
arranged On the crossbeams 8.<br>
Figure 6a shows a cross-section and Figure 6b a<br>
plan view of a crushing device according to the<br>
invention, comprising one rotor 1 and two stators 7<br>
arranged laterally on the longitudinal beams 9 of the<br>
frame, at least one stator 7 being displaceable<br>
relative to the rotor axis 2, in particular along the<br>
longitudinal beam 9.<br><br>

6.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein<br>
the crushing elements are of a plate-like shape and have at<br>
least three lateral edges and wherein depending on a<br>
selected twisting angle of said twistable stator one or the<br>
other of said lateral edges aligned transversally to the<br>
material flow direction is involved in the crushing.<br><br>
7.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the<br>
crushing elements have four lateral edges and a<br>
substantially orthogonal cross-section.<br>
8.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,<br>
wherein the twistable stator is hydraulically lockable.<br>
9.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the<br>
hydraulic locking of the stator is de-activated on reaching<br>
a specified pressure load and blocked at a pressure load<br>
below said specified pressure load.<br>
10.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, also<br>
has a frame surrounding the crushing device, wherein the<br>
stator is located between the frame and a hook.<br><br>
11.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 10, wherein<br>
the stator is located between the frame and a rotor.<br>
12.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein<br>
the rotor is adjustable.<br>
13.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 12, wherein<br>
the rotor is hydraulically adjustable.<br>
14.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein<br>
either or both of the hooks and the crushing elements are<br>
replaceable.<br>
15.	The crushing device as claimed in Claim 14, wherein<br>
either or both of the hooks and the crushing elements are<br>
at least partially covered with a protective element.<br><br>
The invention relates to a crushing device, for example for crushing products associated with the disposal, processing<br>
and recycling of refuse and valuable materials. According to the invention the device consists of at least one rotor (1), on the<br>
periphery of which hooks are mounted (3) and at least one stator (4, 7), whereby the latter (4, 7) can be offset in the direction of the<br>
rotor axis (2) and/or rotated about its stator axis (5), once its locked position has been released. Crushing elements (6) are mounted<br>
on the stator (4), a lateral edge (10a) being aligned transversally to the direction of material flow and co-operating with the hooks<br>
(3) during the crushing process. At least one hook (3) rotates between two respective crushing elements (6), the rotational plane of<br>
said hook being located in a substantially eccentric area in relation to the interval between two crushing elements (6). By rotating<br>
the stator (4) through 90Â°. the edge (10a) can be replaced by the following edge (10b) in the peripheral direction, thus considerably<br>
prolonging the service life of the stator (4).</td>
