				<td>RESPIRATORY DEVICE FOR A BRAKE CYLINDER<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a respiratory device for a brake cylinder.<br>
A respiratory device of similar nature is known from DE 29 43 763 C2.<br>
A respiratory device finds application in a brake cylinder, which features a plunger, impacted by a spring, the said plunger dividing the brake cylinder into a pressure medium chamber and a spring chamber. The brake cylinder can be constructed as Spring Accumulator Brake Cylinder ( abbreviated as SABC), whose spring impacts the plunger in the direction of the brake operation. Pressure medium is regulated in the pressure medium chamber for release of the brake. The brake cylinder, however, can also be constructed in such a way that the plunger is impacted by the spring in the direction of the brake release and, through control of pressure medium in the pressure medium chamber, against the force of the spring in the direction of the brake operation.<br>
If, for example, a brake cylinder, constructed as SABC, is operated through relief of pressure in its pressure medium chamber, the spring chamber gets enlarged through resultant easing of tension of the spring and displacement of the plunger. Low pressure ensues in the spring chamber through this enlargement; to guard against any impediment which this low pressure might cause to the delivery of the force of the spring, the spring chamber is connected with the pressure medium chamber of the SABC by means of a valve, serving as a respiratory device, or with the pressure medium chamber of another brake cylinder, called the service brake cylinder, which again is connected with the SABC.<br>
The pressure medium, which enters the pressure medium chamber of the SABC or the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder, is purified and dried earlier in the apparatus for a)supply and b) cleaning of the pressure medium ; hence, through such method of respiration, the danger of corrosion and soiling in the area of the spring chamber and on the spring, is decidedly reduced.<br>
The familiar respiratory devices work like this : for all customary filling, speeds in use for the pressure medium chamber to be filled with the pressure medium, a pressure builds up between the spring chamber and the pressure medium chamber inspite of an outflow through the first, still - open valve, which is normally sufficient to displace the valve body of this valve against the force of a spring element and consequently to close the valve.<br>
1<br><br>
For such a respiratory device it cannot be completely ruled out however, that while the pressure medium chamber is getting filled, the compressed air. which 	flows out through the valve. builds a pressure also in the spring chamber : this pressure strikes against the rear side of the valve body and thus delays the closing of the valve, whereby, specially in case of a brake cylinder built as SABC the response pattern of the brake cylinder can be adversely affected.<br>
The objective of this invention is therefore to improve a respiratory device of a construction's mentioned at the outset.in such a manner that a negative influence of the response pattern of the respiratory device, as well as a negative influence of the response pattern of a SABC, in which the respiratory device has been employed, are avoided as far as possible.<br>
This objective is met through the execution schemes of the invention, as indicated in the Patent Claims 1,2 and 3. Further developments and other favourable dispositions as per the invention arc indicated in the Sub Claims.<br>
The invention specially offers the advantage that, with simple means, a sensitive response of the respiratory valve, which is employed to connect the spring chamber with the pressure medium chamber of a brake cylinder, is achieved. By slowly regulating the pressure medium in the pressure medium chamber, the pressure medium, which possibly reaches the spring chamber during the closing operation of the respiratory valve, cannot reach the rear side of the movable valve body, because the valve body - with its side which is turned away from the control chamber of the respiratory valve - dips into another additional chamber and this is at least nearly pressure leak proof.<br>
It happens this way. During a movement in the closing direction of the respiratory valve, the valve body compresses lightly the air which is present in the additional chamber and this gives rise to a back force ( restoring force) for the valve bod)'. By suitably dimensioning the additional chamber and the working area of the valve body in contact with the chamber, the force, generated through compression of air in the chamber, can be sufficient to return (restore)the valve body, so that a spring, which may be required to provide the necessary force for return of the valve body, is dispensed with.<br>
By changing the working surfaces (effective areas) of the valve body, which are placed against each other and through application of different springs for the valve, the response sensitivity of the valve can be varied.<br>
It is of special advantage when the valve in the respirator)' device is constructed as a pre-regulated vahe. which functions like this : when the plunger of the SABC lifts in the direction of the brake operation, first the control chamber of the valve and then a working port of the valve get connected with the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder. To this end. the respirator)' device has a second valve and  if necessary, a third valve : the second valve is turned on earlier than the one working port and the third valve<br>
2<br><br>
is turned on earlier than the control port of the first valve, which functions as the respiratory valve.<br>
Through a pre-regulation of the valve, which serves as respiratory valve, it is achieved that for a lift of the plunger of SABC in the direction of the brake operation and pressure medium being simultaneously present in the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder, the respiratory valve is already brought to its closing position. At this stage, the connection between the working port of the respiratory valve and the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder is not yet set free.<br>
The first valve, which also functions as the respiratory valve, is so constructed and is so placed on or in the plunger rod of the SABC, that the sealing element, which is placed in the through opening for the plunger rod, can take up the function of a packing (sealing)for the second valve and for a third valve, if necessary, in addition to its sealing and guiding function for the plunger rod.<br>
The valve , functioning as the respiratory valve,can also be constructed advantageously in the shape of a valve cartridge, which can be placed in the through opening provided either in the plunger or in the plunger rod of the brake cylinder.<br>
For a brake cylinder, constructed as SABC, through the respiratory device as per the invention, meant for the spring chamber, a good response pattern of the SABC can be achieved additionally.<br>
With the help of drawings, three examples of execution scheme of the invention are explained in detail below.<br>

In Fig. 1, a combination of spring accumulator brake cylinder (SABC) and service brake cylinder (1,2) is shown, which comprises a SABC (1) and a service brake cylinder (2), these being held together as a single unit of construction. The SABC (1) has a casing (30,3), which consists of a common wall (30) between the SABC (1) and the service brake cylinder (2) and a dome shaped cover (3). In the casing (30,3), a plunger (piston), which acts as plunger for the spring accumulator, is sealed by an 'o' ring (8) and is movable in the axial direction of the casing (30,3). The plunger ( 7) divides the SABC (1) into a pressure medium chamber (4), which serves as a discharge chamber and a spring chamber ( 9). In the spring chamber (9) is placed a spring (12), which acts as an accumulator spring ; one end of the spring rests on the cover (3) of the casing (30,3) and the other end strikes against the plunger (7) in the direction of the pressure medium chamber (4) i.e. direction of the brake operation. A plunger rod ( 5), made from a tube, is placed centrally on the plunger (7) on the side in contact with the pressure medium chamber (4); this rod passes through the pressure medium chamber (4), a clear hole (32) m the wall (30) and extends in the direction of and upto the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2), this pressure medium chamber (22) acting as sendee brake chamber. The plunger rod (5) is closed with a bottom part (31) on its side facing the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). The wall (30) has a circular projection jutting into the pressure medium chamber (4 ) of the SABC (1). which marks the beginning of the clear hole (32) for the plunger rod (5) of the SABC (1); this projection also serves the purpose of a guide (33) for the plunger rod (5).<br>
A ring shaped gasket (13,52), which wraps around the plunger rod (5) tightly, is placed in<br>
4<br><br>
the guide (33) for the plunger rod (5): besides its sealing function, it also serves as a guiding element for the plunger rod (5). Coaxial with the plunger rod (5). a clear hole (] 0) is made in the plunger (7) for accommodating a manually operated loosening clement for the spring accumulator. The cross section of the clear hole (10) is so chosen that between the loosening element for the spring accumulator and the wall of the through hole (10). a ring gap remains.over which the inner space of the tubular shaped plunger rod (5) - functioning as the joining canal (6) - is connected with spring chamber (9).<br>
A pressure medium port(16) in the wall (30) of the casing (30.3) of the SABC O) in association with a valve, which is built e.g. as a hand brake valve (17). makes it possible for the'prcssure medium chamber (4) to be connected suitably with a source of compressed air (18) or with the atmosphere.<br>
The service brake cylinder (2) is joined with the SABC (1); it has a casing (30.27). The casing (30,27) of the service brake cylinder (2) is built up of the common wall (30) for the SABC (1) and the service brake cylinder (2) and a dome shaped cover (27). A plunger (23.24), functioning as service brake plunger and comprising of a membrane (23) and a membrane plate (24). sub divides the service brake cylinder into a pressure medium chamber (22), also doing duty as service brake chamber, and a spring chamber (25). The membrane (23) is stretched between the wall (30) and the cover (27) of the casing (30.27). The plunger (23,24) is impacted by a spring (26), which rests on the cover (27). in the direction of brake release on the pressure medium chamber (22). A plunger rod (29) is fixed centrally on the membrane plate (24 ). which extends beyond the casing (30.27) through a clear hole (28) in the cover (27). In the clear hole (28) a gasket is put. which wraps around the plunger rod (29) and which, in addition to its sealing function. serves as a guide for the plunger rod (29). In the wall (30) of the casing (30,27), a pressure medium port (21) is placed. By means of the pressure medium port (21) and a valve (19). which is built as a service brake valve, the pressure medium chamber (22) is connected, as required, with a source of compressed air (20) or with the atmosphere.<br>
The tubular plunger (5) of the SABC (1) has a thick section (11) at its free end. Here in this thick section, a first valve ( 50,40,34,14.15 ) of the respiratory valve of the respirator)' device for the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) is placed.<br>
With the help of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the respirator)' device is described below.<br>
As in Fig.2, in the thick section (11) of the plunger rod (5). a pocket drill type, lightly stepped hole (35,46) is made; this hole starts from the bottom part (31) of the plunger rod (5) and running along the axis of the plunger rod (5). extends up to the thick section (11). The hole (35.46) is closed with a closing piece (36) at the end having the larger diameter. In the thick section (11) of the plunger rod (5). across the longitudinal axis of the plunger rod (5) are placed the first hole as a first working port(34). the second hole as a second working port (14) and the third hole as a control port (15). all the three holes terminating at the stepped hole (35. 46). In the hole (35.46). a lightly stepped valve bod)' ( 39.42.44). conforming to the hole (35.46). and which can be slid along the longitudinal axis of the<br>
5<br><br>
hole (35,46), is placed. The valve body (39.42.44) carries a ring shaped sealing body (40) and forms - in conjunction with a valve seat (50). which again is formed through the step in the hole (35.46) and also with the first working port (34). the second working port (14) and the control port (15)—the first valve (50,40.34.14,15) acting as the respiratory valve for the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1).<br>
The first valve { 50.40.34.14.15), functioning as the respiratory valve , forms together with a shut-off type second valve ( 5.14.13.52 ) and a pre-control type third valve<br>
(5,15.13,52 ) a pre-regulated valve arrangement ( 50,40,34.14.15.5.13.52 ).<br>
Both the working ports (34 and 14) and the control port (15) are so placed in the wall of the plunger rod (5) and with respect to the ring shaped gasket (13,52) and the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) that the second working port (14) and the control port (15) of the first valve ( 50,40,34,14,15 ) are covered by the gasket (13,52), when the plunger (7) of the SABC (3) is at its left end position, in which case it holds the spring (12) under tension. The valve body ( 39,42,44) has a tied up area (42) which lies between the part having the larger diameter ( 39) and the part having the smaller diameter (44) of the valve body ( 39,42,44). In such a construction, the following surfaces are generated on the valve body ( 39,42.44 ): a first working surface (38), a second working surface (45) laid against a first working surface ( 38), a third working surface (41) and a fourth working surface (43). The first working surface (38) and the second working surface (45) are formed through the front sides of the valve body (39,42,44) which are turned away from each other. The third working surface (41) and the fourth working surface (43) are formed through the sides, which face each other and which are at the end of the tied up area (42) of the valve body ( 39,42,44 ); the third working surface (41) is directed against the first working surface (38) and the fourth working surface (43) is directed against the second working surface (45).<br>
The first working surface (38) lies at the end of a control chamber (37). The area (39) adjoining the first working surface (38) of the valve body ( 39,42,44 ) has consequently the function of a control plunger for the valve (50,40,34,14,15). The third working surface (41) and the fourth working surface (43) lie at the end of a working chamber (49), through which both the working ports ( 34 and 14) are connected with each other when the first valve ( 50,40,34.14,15) is open. The second working surface (45) of the valve body ( 39,42,44) lies at the end of an additional chamber (48), in which the valve body ( 39,42,44 ) dips with its area (44) having the smaller diameter. In this chamber (48), a spring (47) is placed as restoring force for the valve body ( 39,42,44); this spring impacts the valve body ( 39.42.44) in the direction of and on the control chamber ( 37) -opening direction of the first valve ( 50,40.34.14,15)- and so , in case when the control chamber is without any pressure, holds the first valve ( 50.40,34,14.15) in its open position. The working surfaces ( 38.45.41.43) of the valve body (39,42.44) and the spring (47) are so designed that for an impact on the control chamber (37) by the pressure from the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). the applied force through pressure on the first working surface (38) of the valve body ( 39.42.44) in the closing direction of the first valve ( 50,40, 34, 14, 15) is higher than the force . which is<br>
6<br><br>
in opposite direction to the above force and is applied by the spring (47) of the first valve (50.40.34.14.15) on the valve body (39,42.44) in the opening direction of the first valve ( 50.40.34.14.15) and the force . applied through pressure in the pressure medium chamber (22) on the differential working surfaces generated through the third working surface (41) and the fourth working surface (43) in the opening direction of the first valve (50.40.34,14.15).<br>
When the pressure in the pressure medium chamber (22) impacts the working surfaces (41 and 43) Hanking the working chamber (49). a force is developed on the valve body (39,42,44) in the opening direction of the first valve ( 50,40,34. 14.15), since the third working surface (41). directed against the first working surface (38). is somewhat larger than the fourth working surface (43). which again is directed against the third working surface (41). The difference between these working surfaces (43 and 41) necessarily results from the fact that the first valve (50, 40,34,14.15) is constructed as a seated valve and hence that pan (39) of the valve body ( 39.42.44). carrying the sealing body (40). must have a diameter bigger than the part (44) of the valve body ( 39,42.44), which is guided in the portion (46) of the stepped hole ( 35,46). which has the valve seat (50)<br>
If the first valve is constructed not as a seat valve but as a slide valve, in which a valve body, made as a valve slider, is guided along on a control opening, it is not required to construct the valve bore and the valve body in a stepped manner. The working surfaces of the valve body, flanking the working chamber and arranged opposite to each other, are then equally large.<br>
Through different combinations of working surfaces on the valve body (39,42,44), which is achieved through altering diameter tolerances of the valve body (39,42,44) and through application of different springs , the necessary operating force to operate the first valve (50,40.34.14.15) can be changed in a simple manner.<br>
The chamber (48). flanked by the second working surface (45) of the first valve (50,40,34,14,15) is sealed almost in a pressure tight way against the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) and against the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) through dipping in of the area (44) of the valve body (39,42,44) into the chamber (48) ; hence, a rise in pressure in the pressure medium chamber (22), when the first valve (50.40.34,14,15) is still open, does not lead to a rise in pressure in the additional chamber (48). Since the valve body (39,42.44) of the first valve (50.40.34,14,15) carries out only a relatively small lift in the direction towards the chamber (48) during the closing operation, the air in the chamber (48) is not so strongly compressed that the resultant force, which acts on the valve body (39.42.44) in the opening direction of the first valve (50.40.34.14.15). impedes the closing movement of the valve body ( 39,42.44).<br>
Over the joining canal (6) in the plunger rod (5) and the clear hole (10) in the plunger (7) of the SABC (1). the first working port (34) of the first valve (50.40.34.14.15) connects the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) with the working chamber (49) of the first valve<br>
7<br><br>
(50.40.34.14.15). The second working port (14) serves the function of connecting the working chamber (49) with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) while the first valve (50.40,34,14.15) is turned on in stages. Over the control port (15), the control chamber (37) of the first valve (50,40,34,14l ,5) is similarly connected with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder.<br>
The gasket (13.52) has a recess (51) on its side facing the plunger rod (5) of the SABC (1), in which the second working port (14) and the control port (15) of the first valve ( 50. 40.34.14,15) terminate, when these ports are covered by the gasket (13,52). The end portion of the gasket (13.52), which faces the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2), is made as a sealing lip : this surrounds the plunger rod (5) like a ring and fits tightly on the same. The sealing lip forms a pilot edge (52) for a second valve (5,14,13,52) and a third valve (5,15,13,52).<br>
The hole in the plunger rod (5), which functions as the second working port (14) of the first valve (50,40, 34,14,15), has the additional function of a control (regulator) opening for the second valve (5,14, 13, 52), which is built as a slide valve ; the hole in the plunger rod (5), which functions as the control port (15) of the first valve ( 50,40, 34,14,15) has to this end the additional function of a control opening for the third valve (5,15,13,52), which is built as a slide valve. The gasket (13,52) consequently builds the second valve (5,14,13,52) with the second working port (14) and the third valve (5,15,13,52) with the control port (15).<br>
The second working port (14) and the control port (15) are so arranged with respect to each other that, starting from the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2), the control port (15) lies nearer to the pressure medium chamber (22) than the second working port (14). Through such a disposition of the ports (14 &amp; 15), it obtains that when the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) lifts in the direction of the brake operation (towards right, in the direction of the wall (30) of the SABC ), first the pre control type third valve (5,15,13,52) is brought to its open position, in which it connects the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) with the control chamber (37) of the first valve ( 50,40, 34, 14,15) and then the shut off type second valve (5,14,13, 52) is brought to its open position, in which it connects the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) with the second working port (14) of the first valve (50,40,34,14,15).<br>
Through such a construction of the respirator)' valve as a pre-regulated valve, it is made sure that when the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) is impacted by pressure and simultaneously the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) operates in the direction of the brake operation, the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) is not connected with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2).<br>
The arrangement of the third valve (5,15,13,52) in the respirator)' device for this purpose is not absolutely necessary. It is important that when the the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) lifts in the direction of the brake operation, first the control chamber (37) and then the<br>
8<br><br>
second working port (14) of the first valve (50,40,34,14.15)- serving as the respiratory valve - are connected with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). so that the first valve (50.40.34.14.15) is closed when the pressure medium chamber (22) is impacted by pressure before its working port (14) gets connected with the pressure medium chamber (22).<br>
When the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) lifts in the direction of brake release (towards left, in the direction away from the wall (30)). first the second valve (5.14.13.52) and then the third valve (5.15.13.52) are brought to their closing position.<br>
The combination of SABC and service brake cylinder, as shown in Figs. 3 &amp; 5. are not described in detail since it resembles in its construction the combination of SABC and service brake cylinder as shown in Fig.l. These Figures merely help in better understanding of the function of the respirator)' device as per the invention.<br>
The same holds good for the valves, as shown in Figures 4 &amp; 6 - respiratory valve (50.40,34,14,15), pre control valve ( 5,15,13,52) and shut off valve (5,14,13, 52)-of the combined SABC and service brake cylinders, which resemble the valves, as shown in Fjg.2.<br>
The Figures 1,3 &amp; 5 show the combined SABC and service brake cylinder in different operational modes. The Figures 2, 4 &amp; 6 show the valves, functioning as respirator)' device for the spring chamber of the SABC, in their switched on (turned on) positions. which these have assumed in the different operational modes of the combined SABC and service brake cylinder.<br>
The functioning of the respirator}' device as per the invention is explained in detail below.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 &amp; 2, the combined SABC and service brake cylinder (L2) are in such an operational mode, where the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) is impacted by pressure whereas the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) is without any pressure. The spring (12) of the SABC (1) is under tension by the plunger (7), which is at its end position at the left. In this position of the plunger ( 7). the second working port (14) and the control port (15) of the first valve ( 50, 40, 34, 14.15) get covered by the gasket (13,52). The first valve (50,40. 34, 14,15) is in its open position. The second valve (5,14,13.52) and the third valve ( 5,15. 13. 52) are in their closed position: the control chamber (37) and the second working port (14) are now shut against the pressure medium chamber (22 ) of the service brake cvlinder (2) The spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) is consequently shut against the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) by means of the second valve (5.14.l3.52).(Fig2).<br>
If compressed air is let into the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). its plunger (23.24) is driven by the pressure. building up in the pressure medium chamber (22). in the direction of the brake operation : that means, towards and upon the spring chamber (25). against the force of the spring (26). The plunger (7) of the<br>
9<br><br>
SABC (1) remains in the position, as shown in Fig.l, so long as the pressure medium<br>
chamber (4) of the SABC does not get ventilated. The first valve (50, 40. 34. 14. 15) is in its open position ( normal position ), in which the first working port (34) and the second working port (14) are connected with each other. The second valve (5.14.13,52) and the third valve ( 5.15,13,52) remain in their closed positions. This configuration corresponds with the positions of the first valve (50,40,34,14,15), the second valve (5,14,13.52) and the third valve (5.15. 13. 52). as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
If the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) gels again ventilated, the plunger (23.24) of the service brake cylinder (2) returns to its starting position, acted upon by the force of the spring (26).<br>
As shown in Figures 3 &amp;4, if the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) gels ventilated over the hand brake type valve (17), the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) is driven in the direction of the brake operation by the spring (12), whose tension gets relaxed. The plunger (23,24) of the service brake cylinder (2) is then driven in the same direction by the plunger rod (5) of the plunger (7) of the SABC (1). In the process, the control port (15) and the second working port (14) of the first valve ( 50, 40, 34, 14,15 ) overshoots the pilot edge (52) of the gasket (13,52). The second valve ( 5,14, 13, 52 ) and the third valve ( 5.15,13. 52) reach thereby their open position. The spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) is then connected with the pressure less pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) over the joining canal (6) in the plunger rod (5), the first valve (50,40,34,14,15), which is already in its open position , and the open second valve (5,14.13,52). The pressure medium chamber (22) remains connected with the atmosphere over the service brake valve (19).<br>
When pressure medium is let in the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC, the plunger (7) moves in the direction of the spring chamber (9). The air, present in the spring chamber (9), is then squeezed in to the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) over the open first valve (50,40, 34,14,15) and the open second valve (5,14.13,52). Over the open service brake valve, this air reaches the atmosphere from the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). In the later part of lift of the plunger (7) of the SABC (1), the second valve (5,14,13,52) reaches its closed position and blocks the connection between the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) and the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2), so that when the plunger (7) moves further in the same direction, a small amount of overpressure can be generated in the spring chamber (9). By placing a ventilation valve in the wall of the casing (30,3) of the SABC, even this small overpressure in the spring chamber (9) can be discharged to the atmosphere.<br>
When compressed air is let in to the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) over the service brake valve (I9),with the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) remaining pressure less, it also impacts the control chamber (37) of the first valve ( 50,40,34,14,15). The compressed air simultaneously arrives at the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) over the second working port (14). the work chamber (49)<br>
10<br><br>
and the first working port (34) of the first valve ( 50, 40, 34; 14, 15) and also the canal (6) in the plunger rod (5).<br>
The compressed air. however, cannot enter the chamber (48) of the first valve (50,40.34.14,15) and therefore also cannot impact the second working surface ( 45) of the valve body ( 39.42,44). this working surface lying opposite to the first working surface (38) of the valve body ( 39;42;44) and Hanking the control chamber (37); because of this, the closing process of the first valve ( 50.40.34.14,15) is not obstructed and consequently also not delayed. A negligibly small quantity of compressed air. therefore, enters the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1).<br>
As shown in Fig.5. when the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) is connected with the atmosphere over the hand brake type valve (17) while the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) is still impacted by pressure, the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) is driven- by the force of the relaxing spring (12) of the SABC (1) -in the direction of the brake operation, that means, to the right towards the pressure medium chamber (4). The plunger rod (5) of the SABC (1) thereby dips into the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2). Due to the fact that, looking from the pressure medium chamber (22), the control port (15) is placed before the second working port (14) of the first valve (50, 40, 34, 14, 15). the control port (15) crosses the pilot edge (52) of the gasket (13,52) right then, when the second working port (14) is still covered by the gasket (13,52). The pilot edge (52) of the gasket (13,52) lies between the control port (15) and the second working port (14). as seen in Fig.6. Compressed air from the pressure chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) then reaches the control chamber (37) of the first valve (50,40,34,14,15) over the control port (15). If the pressure in the pressure medium chamber (22) rises so high that the force it exerts on the first working surface (38) of the valve body (39,42,44) overcomes the force in the opposite direction, exerted by the spring (47) on the second working surface (45) of the valve body (39.42,44), the valve body (39,42,44) moves towards left in the direction of the additional chamber (48) of the first valve (50,40,34,14,15) to the extent till it takes the position at the valve seat (50) with its sealing body (40). The first valve ( 50,40, 34,14,15) is then closed. During further movement of the plunger rod (5) of the plunger (7) of the SABC (1) in the direction of the pressure medium chamber (22), the second working port (14) of the first valve ( 50,40,34,14,15) crosses the pilot edge ( 52) of the gasket (13,52). The second working port (14) of the first valve (50,40,34, 14,15) is then exposed to the pressure in the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder. Since the first valve (50,40,34,14,15) has reached however its closed position earlier, the pressure chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) remains shut against the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1).<br>
In Fig. 7. a combined SABC and service brake cylinder is shown, which essentially has the same construction as shown in Fig.l for the combined SABC and the service brake cylinder. For a better overview, identical parts have been marked with the same reference numbers.<br>
11<br><br>
For this combined SABC and service brake cylinder, the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1) is connectable not with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder (2) but with the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1).<br>
The respiratory device for the spring chamber (9) is placed for this purpose in the wall of the plunger (7) of the SABC (1).<br>
As can be seen in Fig.8. the valve ( 54.50.40.34.14.15). constructed as a pressure controlled respiratory valve, has essentially the same construction, like the respiratory \alve as shown in Fig.2. Contrary to the respiratory valve shown in Fig.2. however, the casing of the respiratory valve is not built from a part of the plunger rod (5) or the plunger (7) of the brake cylinder.<br>
The valve, serving as respiratory valve, is constructed as a stand alone valve ; it has a casing (54), in which a lightly stepped hole (35.46) is made. The valve body (39,42,44) is movable in the hole (35,46) along its longitudinal axis. The first working port (34), the second working port (14) and the control port (15) are made up of holes , which penetrate the wall of the casing (54) across the longitudinal axis of the stepped hole (35,46). The valve body (39,42,41) shows the first working surface ( 38), the second working surface (45) which is opposite to the first working surface (38), the third working surface (41) lying opposite to the first working surface (38) and the fourth working surface (43) which is opposite to the second working surface (45). Further, in the casing (54) are placed the control chamber (37) flanking the first working surface (38), the working chamber (49) bound by the third (41) and fourth (43) working surfaces and also the additional chamber (48) flanking the second working surface (45), a spring (47) being placed in the additional chamber(48). Both the working ports ( 34 &amp; 14) terminate at the working chamber (49) and the control port (15) terminates at the control chamber (37). The step of the stepped hole (35,46) is made as valve seat (50), which, together with the ring shaped sealing body (40) placed on the valve body (39,42,44), builds up the valve.<br>
The plunger (7) of the SABC (1) has a clear hole (55), in whose walls threads (56) are cut. In the clear hole (55), the valve (54,50,40,34,14,15), doing duty as respiratory valve, is screwed in. The control port (15) and the second working port (14) remain connected with the pressure medium chamber (4) and the first working port (34) remains connected with the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1). In the cover (3) of the casing of the SABC (1), a ventilation valve (53) is placed.<br>
Through pre-control of the respiratory type valve ( 54.50,40,34,14,15) by a pre-control valve and a shut-off valve, by means of which the second working port (14) and the control port (15) can be shut, depending upon the lift of the plunger, this respiratory device can be done away with.<br>
This respiratory device works like this : the valve (54.50.40.34,14,15) is in its open position when the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) is without pressure.<br>
12<br><br>
whereby it connects with each other the pressure medium chamber (4) and the spring chamber (9) of the SABC (1). If pressure medium is let into the pressure medium chamber (4) over the hand brake type valve (17). the built up pressure in the pressure medium chamber (4) causes the plunger (7) to move against the force of the spring (12) in the direction of the spring chamber (9). Simultaneously, the pressure in the pressure medium chamber (4) impacts the control chamber (37) and the second working port (14) of the valve ( 54,50.34,14.15). If the pressure rises to such an extent that the force it exerts on the first working surface (38) of the valve body ( 39,42,44) overcomes the opposite force, acting on the differential working surface, generated out of the third working surface (41) and the fourth working surface (43) of the valve body ( 39;42,44) and also the force of the spring (47). acting on the valve body (39,42.44) in the opening direction of the valve ( 54,50,40, 34,14,15), the valve (54,50;40.34,14,15) reaches its closed position. The spring chamber (9) and the pressure medium chamber (4) of the SABC (1) are then shut against each other.<br>
By means of the pressure, further building up in the pressure medium chamber (4), the plunger (7) is pushed against the force of the spring (12) in the direction of the spring chamber (9). When a predetermined force is attained viz. the closing force of the ventilation valve (53). the resultant built up pressure in the spring chamber (9) causes this io open. The over pressure in the spring chamber (9) then discharges itself to the atmosphere.<br>
Fig.9 shows the service brake cylinder, which displays a plunger (23,24) built of a membrane (23) and a membrane plate (24). On membrane plate (24), the plunger rod (29) of the service brake cylinder is placed. A lightly stepped hole ( 59,58.57) is placed centrally in the membrane (23), the membrane plate (24) and in the front side of the plunger rod (29), which faces the membrane plate (24); starting from the membrane (23), through the membrane (23) and the membrane plate (24), it extends in to the plunger rod (29). The hole ( 59,58,57) is constructed as a pocket drill. In the hole (59.58,57), the respiratory valve (54,50,40,34,14,15), as already described, is placed. The valve has the first working port (34), the second working port (14) and the control port (15). In the zone of the stepped hole (57,58,59), the membrane (23), the membrane plate (24) and also the plunger rod (29) are connected with each other sealed against the hole (57,58,59), so that a connection between the spring chamber (25) and the pressure medium chamber (22) can take place only over the valve (54,50,34,14,15).<br>
The respiratory valve (54,50,40, 34.14,15) is built as a stand alone valve, which has a casing (54). Both the working ports (34 and 14) and the control port (15) are made in the shape of holes penetrating the wall of the casing (54). The respirator)' valve (54,50,40,34.14.15) is also built in a stepped construction, corresponding with the stepped hole (50,58.57) in the plunger (23,24) and in the plunger rod (29) and is so placed in the hole (59,58,57) of the plunger rod (29) that it links up with a hole (61) in the plunger rod (29) with its first working port (34). Across the longitudinal axis of the plunger rod (29), the hole (61) is so placed in it that it connects the first working port (34) of the respiratory valve ( 54,50.40,34,14.15) with the spring chamber (25) of the service brake cylinder.<br>
13<br><br>
The second working port (14) and the control port (15) terminate in the portion (59;58) of the stepped hole (59.58.57). which has a bigger diameter than the respiratory valve ( 54.50.40,34,14,15). Over this portion (59,58) of the hole (59;58:57) of the plunger rod (29), the second working port (14) and the control port (15) are connected with the pressure medium chamber (22) of the service brake cylinder. In the area between the first working port (34) and the second working port (14) of the respirator)' valve (54.50,40,34.14.15). between a flange shaped part of the casing (54) of the respiratory valve ( 54,50.40,34,14;15) and the step of the hole ( 59,58.57/of the plunger rod (29), scaling medium as. for example, a sealing ring (60) or liquid sealant is provided. The scaling medium prevents an undesirable connection between the pressure medium chamber (22) and the spring chamber (25), which can happen over a possible gap between the casing (54) of the respirator)' valve (54,50,40.34,14,15) and the portion (57) of the wall of the hole ( 59,58,57), caused by .for example, manufacturing tolerances.<br>
The respiratory valve (54,50,40,34,14,15) works in a manner that the valve body (39-42,44) takes a position, as shown in Fig. 10, when the pressure medium chamber (22) is without pressure. Over the open respiratory valve ( 54,50,40,34.14,15), the first working port (34) and the second working port (14) are connected with each other. Consequently, over the open respiratory valve ( 54,50,40,34,14,15), also the pressure medium chamber (22) is connected with the spring chamber (25).<br>
When pressure is let into the pressure medium chamber (22), pressure from the pressure medium chamber (22) reaches over the portion (59,58) of the hole (59,58,57) in the plunger rod (29) and over the control port (15) into the control chamber (37) of the respiratory valve (54,50,40,34,14,15). If the force, exerted by the pressure on the first working surface (38) of the valve body (39,42,44), is so high that it overcomes the opposite force exerted by the spring (47) on the valve body (39,42.44), the valve body (39.42,44) with its sealing element ( gasket) (40) takes a position at the valve seat (50). The respiratory valve (54,50,40,34,14,15) is then in its closed position, in which it shuts the first working port (34) and the second working port ( 14) and consequently, the pressure medium chamber (22) against the spring chamber (25). The plunger (23,24), through the pressure further building up in the pressure medium chamber (22), is pushed in the direction of the spring chamber (25) against the force of the spring (26). When a pre determined force - the closing force of the ventilation valve (62) - is reached, the resultant built up pressure in the spring chamber (25) causes the valve to open. The overpressure in the spring chamber (25) then discharges itself to the atmosphere.<br>
In the case of the respirator)' device as per the invention, it is of special importance that the working surface (45) of the valve body (39.42.44). which is kept at that end of the valve body (39,42.44), which faces away from the control chamber (37), is shielded as far as possible against the spring chamber (9) and also against the pressure medium chamber (22) of the brake cylinder. Through this measure, it is prevented that when the pressure medium chambers (4,22) of the brake cylinders (1,2) are impacted by compressed air. the pressure possibly building up in the spring chamber in the closing phase of the valve (50.40,34,14,15). impacts that side of the valve body ( 39,42,44), which faces away from<br>
14<br><br>
the control chamber (37) of the valve ( 50,40.34.14.15). and thus obstructs the closing operation of the valve (50.40.34.14,15).<br>
A gasket can be placed between the area of the valve body, which dips into the additional chamber, and the wall flanking this chamber so that this chamber is closed in a pressure tight way.<br>
In relation to the invention, under a movable valve body, each movable part of the valve is to be understood, which, together with a control opening (slide valve) or a valve seat (seal valve) build the valve or which functions as support for a sealing body or a sealing body earning valve part (e.g. valve plunger, control plunger).<br>
The connection line, which connects one working port of the respiratory valve with the spring chamber can be made from the inner space of the tubular plunger rod or. in case of a solid plunger rod, from a hole, partly penetrating the plunger rod along its axis, or also from a connection tube which is laid on or in the plunger rod.<br>
The configuration of a respiratory device as per the invention, in which a prc-conlrol of the respiratory valve has been dispensed with, can be used in a combined SABC and service brake cylinder as well as in a SABC, which does not have a service brake cylinder, or also in a simple service brake cylinder without the spring accumulator part.<br>
It is not necessary to build the pilot edge for the second and third valves from the gasket, which also acts as guide for the plunger rod of the SABC. It can also be provided by a sealing body, independent of the gasket, which can take over the function of the pilot edge.<br>
It is obviously possible to do away with the second valve and the third valve also in case of a combined SABC and service brake cylinder. The respiration of the pressure medium chamber of the SABC from the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder happens then independent of the fact, whether the pressure medium chamber of the SABC is impacted by pressure medium or is without pressure. The valve, functioning as respiratory valve, is in its open position for so long as the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder is ventilated. By letting in pressure in the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder, the valve attains its closed position.<br>
For a configuration of the respirator)' device as per the invention, in which the first valve. serving as the respiratory valve, with a second valve and. if necessary, with a third valve function together, the additional chamber of the first valve can also be done away with. The switching behaviour of the first valve then is. however, no more so good as of a valve, which is equipped with this additional chamber.<br>
The casing of the respirator)' valve must never be made from the wall of the plunger rod or from a part of the spring accumulator plunger. The respiratory valve of course can have a casing of its own, in which the valve body is placed in a movable way and which has<br>
15<br><br>
working ports and a control port. Such a stand alone valve can then be placed on the plunger rod or on the plunger or in a suitable hole or recess made in the plunger rod or in the plunger or also in or on a part, which is attached to the plunger or the plunger rod. In this configuration for the respiratory device, the valve preferably is placed at the front side of the plunger rod of the SABC, this side facing the pressure medium chamber of the service brake cylinder, or at least in the region of this front side of the plunger rod.<br>
