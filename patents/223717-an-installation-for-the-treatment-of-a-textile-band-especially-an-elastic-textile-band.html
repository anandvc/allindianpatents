especially an elastic textile band Technical field<br>
The invention relates to an installation for the treatment of a textile band, especially an elastic textile band, according to the preamble of claim 1. In the simplest case, the invention is suitable for the finishing of a textile band. However, the invention is particularly advantageous for dyeing a textile band.<br>
Prior art<br>
An installation of the type mentioned at the beginning is disclosed, for example, by EP 0 134 914 A. The deflection elements in the steaming station are formed by an open reel arranged in the upper section and a drying cylinder arranged in the lower region, -over which the textile band is guided in band turns located beside one another. The drawback is the lower drying cylinder, on which the textile band sections rest firmly on the drying cylinder over a relatively long distance. As a result of the contact, the textile band sections are prevented from shrinking freely, so that only a limited amount of shrinkage of the textile band is possible during steaming and drying, so that the finally treated textile band exhibits an unfavorable residual shrinkage value, which has a disagreeably detrimental effect on the end user. The fact that the textile band rests on the drying cylinder- also has a detrimental.effect during dyeing.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an. object of the invention to improve an installation of the type mentioned at the beginning.<br><br>
;- -- ::;dir.z ~o the invention, the object is achieved by<br>
tae characterizing features of claim 1.. Forming the<br>
lower deflection element as an open reel results in<br>
substantial improvements. The open reel offers only<br>
small supporting areas to the textile band to be.<br>
treated, so that the textile band is blocked less in<br>
the longitudinal direction, and forms a greater area of<br>
attack for the treatment medium than in the prior art,<br>
which means that the treatment is more intensive and<br>
more effective. As a result of the position of the<br>
support rods, which can be varied at an angle with<br>
respect to the axis of the open reel, and the rotatable<br>
support sleeves on the support rods, the shortening of<br>
the length of .the textile band which is necessary<br>
during shrinkage is possible without hindrance. This<br>
makes it possible for adjacent support sleeves to have<br>
different rotational speeds and, as a result, to adapt<br>
to the length, and the circumferential speed of the<br>
textile band with progressive steaming.. and,<br>
respectively, drying, and therefore to the level of<br>
shrinkage.	j<br>
The open reel also permits the accommodation of a greater length of the textile band in the station with * a reduced overall height, which means that the throughput and therefore the performance of the installation are improved. The lower overall height and therefore the compact design have an advantageous effect on the operability and the energy behavior of the station. The insertion of the textile band into the station and the monitoring are made easier. The compact design permits a more uniform temperature in the station.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are described in claims 2 to 10.<br>
A refinement as claimed in claim 2 is particularly advantageous  if the  inclination  of the  roll with<br><br>
;:■=•. zzcz "o -:".e axis of the open reel is adjustable. As a. result:, nor only can the run of the individual band turns of the textile band along the open reel be improved but, in particular, also the shrinkage of the textile band, since, as the distance from the roll to the open reel is reduced, the lengths of the individual band turns of the textile band decrease, caused by the level of shrinkage. This also facilitates substantially free shrinkage of the textile band and therefore also a reduction in the residual shrinkage value of the finished textile band at the end user.<br>
The adjustment of the inclination of the roll and of the support rods of the open reel can be carried out independently of one another or else in combination with one another.<br>
A development as claimed in claim 3 is advantageous, the individual band turns of the textile band being given improved guidance and alignment by the guide rods engaging between these.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if, as claimed in claim 4, the steaming station and/or the drying station is/are arranged in a closed housing. The performance of the installation may be increased if, according to claim 5, a second open reel and a second roll for the textile band to be treated are arranged in the steaming station and/or the drying station. In this case, it is advantageous if, according to claim 6, the second open reel has a drive which can be controlled individually by a drive of the first open reel, preferably by means of a dancer, in order to adapt the second open reel to the level of shrinkage of the textile band. The development according to claim 7 is particularly preferred, the steam supply in the steaming station being arranged in the lower region and the textile band being fed in and removed from the floor side. By means of this arrangement, a concentrated dome of steam can<br><br>
-■e :?r£&amp;: cur unif crr.Iy, so zhs.z a low-oxygen space is produced. These are ideal, dyeing conditions, since the band is surrounded by intensive steam in the steamer during the entire fixing time, and the dyestuff can in this way penetrate optimally into the textile band and fix- This results in more intensive dyeing of the textile band and a better color yield.<br>
In the simplest case, the installation is configured as claimed in claim 8, the treatment station being constructed as a finishing station which is followed by a drying station.<br>
Particular advantages result if, as claimed in claim 9, the installation is configured for dyeing a textile band, the treatment station being constructed as a dyeing station, which is followed by a steaming station, a washing station, if appropriate a finishing station, and also a drying station. A particularly compact configuration of the installation results, as claimed in claim 10, if the steaming station and the drying station are arranged above the washing station.<br>
Although the installation is in principle designed for the treatment of a single textile band, if appropriate two or three textile bands can also be processed beside one another, in particular if the textile bands are very narrow.<br>

Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Figures 1 to 3 show an installation for dyeing a textile band, preferably an elastic textile band,; which has an inlet 2 for the textile band 4. The textile band passes first through a dyeing station 6, then passes into a steaming station 8, from which it runs into a washing 'Station 10 having three washing baths 10a, 10b, 10c. The textile band 4 further passes through a finishing station 12 before it gets into a drying station 14 and is guided from there into an outlet 16, which can be followed by further individual stations as required. The dyeing station 6, the washing station 10 and the finishing station 12 are of conventional design and will not be described in detail.<br>
As also emerges in particular from figures 4 and 5, both the steaming station 8 and the drying station 14 have a driven open reel 17, which is assigned a roll 18 above. The open reel 17 contains a number of support rods 20 which are distributed in the peripheral direction and which are connected via radial arms 22 to<br><br>
rJrive shaft- 24. The support rods 20 connected to the arms 22 have a plurality of support sleeves 26 (three here) distributed over the length, which are in each case freely rotatably mounted on the support rods 20, so that adjacent support sleeves can have different rotational speeds, in order to facilitate the free shrinkage of the textile band. The roll 18 arranged above the open reel 17 likewise comprises an axle 30, which is fixed to the frame 32, specifically in such a way that its angle a with respect to the open reel 17 is adjustable, as emerges from figures 2 and 4. In a manner analogous to the support rods 20, the roll 18 is provided with freely rotatable support sleeves 34 which are distributed over its length and which permit individual free rotation of the support sleeves 34. As a result, account is likewise taken of the different shrinkage behavior of the textile band. Arranged between the open reel 17 and the-roll 18 are guide rods 36 which engage between each band turn in order to guide the band turns in a manner suitable for operation. The guide rods can be matched to various band widths and, if appropriate, band spacings.<br>
As emerges from figures 2 and 3, in the steaming station 8 the roll 18 is inclined downward toward the open reel 17, as a result of which not only is the band path of the individual loops of the textile band 4 supported from the inlet side; that is to say the left-hand side here, to the outlet side, which is the right-hand side here, but at the same time account is also taken of the level of shrinkage of the textile band. In the drying station 14, the roll 18 is inclined in the opposite manner, that is to say its spacing on the right-hand side of the open reel is greater than on the left-hand side. The right-hand side of the drying station is the inlet side and the left-hand side is the outlet side for the textile band from the drying station. Both for the steaming station 8 and for the _ drying station 14, dancers 38, 40 are provided, which<br><br>
z ir.tr cl ~;.-3 criv^e cf the oper. reel I*7. ret specifically illustrated, in order to adapt said drive to the run of the textile band 4.<br>
The steaming station 8 and the drying station 14 each have a housing 42, 44. A steam generator 48 is arranged on the floor 46 of the steaming station 8. The band inlet 50 for the steaming station 8 is likewise located on the floor 46, as a result of which the textile band is supplied directly to the region of the steam dome of the steam generator 48 and therefore receives intensive and uniform steaming, which is advantageous for the fixing of the color. The band outlet 52 is likewise located on the floor 42 of the steaming station 8. By means of this arrangement, steam losses and therefore also energy losses are avoided.<br>
According to figure 4, the support rods 20 of the open reel 17 can be adjusted by the angle (3 with respect to the drive shaft 24. If p = 0, then the support rods 20 are aligned parallel to the drive shaft 24. In the case of a value differing from zero, the open reel 17 assumes a conical shape. The conical shape of the open reel 17 can be effective on its own or in addition to a roll 18 set at an angle.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show a further exemplary embodiment of an installation for dyeing, in which the steaming station 8a and the drying station 14a each have a second open reel 17a and a second roll 18a. This permits a higher output from the stations and modified band guidance 54 through the steaming station 8a, the washing station 10 and the drying station 14a, as emerges from figures 6 and 7. If appropriate, it is also possible to provide only one of the stations with a second open reel 17a and a second roll 18a.<br><br>
According to a simplified exemplary embodiment of the invention, the installation can be constructed only for the finishing of a band. In this case, instead of the dyeing station 6 of figure 1, the finishing station 12 can come into use, simply following a drying station 14, 14a.<br><br>
