OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to introduce the application of natural compounds Caryophyllene oxide, Caryophyllene and Limonene derived from plant specie Spilanthes Calava D.C. in agriculture field as a pest repellant and insecticide. This plant specie has properties which can be utilized as a pest repellant and insecticide for the all crops, vegetables, horticulture, gardening, forestry and floriculture plants. Plant Spilanthes Calava D.C has natural Compounds Caryophyllene oxide, Caryophyllene and Limonene which have pest repellant and insecticide properties against specific and damaging pest and pathogens. Its effects on non targeted and benefitting insect and animals like honey bee, fish, birds and mammals is nil as compared to the other commonly used pesticides, some insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill. For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake insecticide granules on the ground for food and eat it. The proposed use of Spilanthes Calava D.C has none of the above described ill effects. Other commonly used existing insecticide and pest repellant products are very toxic to mammals and are serious environment pollutant and are relatively expensive. The proposed invention is very safe for mammals and does not contribute to environment pollution as the constituents are harmless compounds like Caryophyllene oxide, Caryophyllene and Limonene. This product is also very cost effective as the constituent compounds are synthesized naturally from the single plant Spilanthes calava D.C. The flower head of the plant is rich in Caryophyllene oxide 24.14%, Caryophyllene 22.19%, Limonene 21.79% and the said plant is wild plant and has no commercial use till date.<br>
The main difference between the commonly used existing pesticides and insecticides and proposed product is that the currently used existing product interrupts growth of plant through the cytotoxic effect, as well as endogenous hormonal imbalance which results in poorer yield of plant. The proposed compounds are derived from natural plant and does not effect the plant growth or cause any kind of chemical imbalance in the crop but only checks and control the insects and pest infestation.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Application of compounds Caryophyllene oxide, Caryophyllene and Limonene derived from plant specie Spilanthes Calava D.C. in agriculture field as a pest repellant and insecticide. This plant specie has properties which can be utilized as a pest repellant and insecticide for the all crops, vegetables, horticulture, gardening, forestry and floriculture plants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pest control is as old as agriculture, as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests. In order to maximize food production, it is advantageous to protect crops from competing species of plants, as well as from herbivores<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Caryophyllene oxide, Caryophyllene and Limonene derived from plant specie Spilanthes Calava D.C. in agriculture field as a pest repellant and insecticide. This plant specie has properties which can be utilized as a pest repellant and insecticide for the all crops, vegetables, horticulture, gardening, forestry and floriculture plants.<br>
These compounds can be easily be extracted from the flower head of said plant and plant parts through the aqueous solvent system These three compounds are found together in one plant specie Spilanthes calava D.C, it has to be used in combination to make aerosol for imparting the knockdown effect. These compounds have three mode of action on the pest, like contact poisoning, nerve poisoning and feeding poisoning.<br>
Spilanthes Calava D.C. - It has innumerable medicinal properties and thus it finds its use on a daily basis. The plant when boiled in water is used to treat dysentery. The decoction is also given as a diuretic and lithotriptic and used as a bath for relieving rheumatism and as a lotion for scabies and psoriasis. The juice .from this Indian medicinal plant is a vulnerary. The pounded herb is used as a poultice to dress wounds. The pungent flower heads are chewed to relieve toothache and affections of the gums and throat, and paralysis of the tongue.<br>
Caryophyllene &amp; Caryophyllene oxide — It's a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene that is a constituent of many essential oils, especially clove oil, the oil from the stems and flowers of Syzygium aromaticum (cloves). The essential oil of hemp Cannabis sativa and rosemary Rosmarinus oficinalis.<br>
Role of Caryophyllene&amp; Caryophyllene oxide - Caryophyllene is an electron transport inhibitor, and cause interference with glucose uptake or utilization. Carycphyllene oxide thus acts as a nerve poison to pest via sodium channel modulators.<br>
Limonene- Limonene is a hydrocarbon, classified as a cyclic terpene. It is a colourless liquid at room temperatures with an extremely strong smell of oranges. It is commonly used in cosmetic products, biofuel thereof. D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, example bitter alkaloids, as a flavoring; it is also used as botanical insecticide. It is added to cleaning products such as hand cleansers to give a lemon-orange fragrance (see orange oil). In contrast, L-limonene has a piney, turpentine-like odor.<br>
Limonene is increasingly being used as a solvent for cleaning purposes, such as the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It also serves as a paint stripper when applied to painted wood. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues.<br>
Role of Limonene- Limonene is Phagostimulant disruptor which inhibits and breaks the developed resistant power against pesticide in the pests. The mechanism is that it acts as pesticide and insecticide , Disturbing or inhibiting the development of the eggs, larvae, or pupae, Blocking the molting of larvae or nymphs, Disturbing mating and sexual communication , Repelling larvae and adults. Deterring females from laying eggs, Sterilizing adults, Deterring feeding. As an insecticide bmonene destroys the wax that coats the inside of the insect's respiratory system. Limonene used as an insecticide is effective as a contact spray only and has no residual effect.<br>
