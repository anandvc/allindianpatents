				<td>THYRISTOR CONTROLLED SERIES CAPACITOR MODULE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the<br>
configuration of thyristor controlled series capacitors<br>
and more specifically to a thyristor controlled series<br>
capacitor module having a reduced number of components.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSC) are used<br>
in power systems as controllable devices connected in<br>
series with a power line. The control offered by TCSC is<br>
an "impedance" type control used for controlled series<br>
compensation.<br>
A prior art TCSC module is shown in Fig. 1. The TCSC<br>
module comprises a capacitor 2 connected in series with<br>
a power line 4. In parallel with the capacitor 2 there<br>
is provided a thyristor valve 6 in series with an<br>
inductor 8. The thyristor valve in itself consists of<br>
two anti-parallel thyristors 6a, 6b in order to provide<br>
bi-directional functionality.<br>
The TCSC module can operate in essentially three<br>
different, modes. In a so-called bypassed mode, the<br>
thyristors are gated for full conduction and the TCSC<br>
module is slightly inductive because of the inductor in<br>
series with the thyristor valve. In a so-called inserted<br>
mode, the capacitor 2 is inserted by turning off the<br>
thyristor valve, i.e., blocking all gating signals to<br>
the thyristors. When the capacitor is inserted, the<br>
thyristors can be gated near the end of each half cycle<br>
in a manner that can circulate controlled amount of<br>
 <br>
inductive current through the capacitor, thereby<br>
increasing the effective capacitive reactance of the<br>
module. This concept is referred to as vernier control.<br>
In order to provide for bypassing of the TCSC module,<br>
three disconnectors 7-9 are provided as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The term disconnector is intended in this description to<br>
refer to devices normally not capable of interrupting a<br>
current. In normal operation, the first and second<br>
disconnectors 7 and 8 are closed and disconnector 9 is<br>
open. In these positions, the disconnectors effectively<br>
connect the TCSC module in series with the power line 4.<br>
The TCSC module shown in Fig. 1 can be exposed to short<br>
circuit currents during line faults, resulting in<br>
stresses on the capacitor. To cope with this situation,<br>
a first breaker 10 is provided in parallel with the<br>
thyristor valve 6. The term breaker is intended in this<br>
description to cover devices capable of breaking or<br>
interrupting a current. During short circuit faults, the<br>
first breaker 10 is closed in order to ensure that the<br>
inductance 8 is included for limitation of capacitor<br>
discharge current. The current path in this situation<br>
through the breaker 10 and thyristor valve 6 is shown in<br>
the figure with a dashed line.<br>
To allow permanent bypass of the module in cases of<br>
internal fault or during maintenance, a second breaker<br>
12 is provided in parallel with the capacitor 2. This<br>
second breaker, when closed, effectively bypasses the<br>
capacitor. The current path in this situation through<br>
the breaker 12 is shown in the figure with a continuous<br>
line. After the breaker 12 has been closed, the dis-<br>
 <br>
connector 9 is closed whereupon the breaker 12 is<br>
opened. Then, with all current flowing through dis-<br>
connector 9 and no current through the TCSC module, the<br>
disconnectors 7 and 8 are opened. In this way, the TCSC<br>
is effectively disconnected from the power line 4.<br>
Finally, the TCSC module shown in Fig. 1 comprises a<br>
varistor 14 connected in parallel with the capacitor 2.<br>
The varistor, being a power surge protection device,<br>
protects the capacitor in case of a voltage spike<br>
appearing across the capacitor.<br>
TCSC modules as many other power line components are<br>
subject to cost-reduction demands. Thus, the provision<br>
of two different breakers contributes to the overall<br>
cost of the TCSC module and is in itself a problem.<br>
Also, as the number of components included in the TCSC<br>
module increases, so is the probability of internal<br>
faults.<br>
A further problem with the configuration of Fig. 1 is<br>
the fact that when operating in thyristor bypass mode,<br>
the fault current will flow through the inductor 8,<br>
resulting in magnetic energy and voltage drop.<br>
A special difficulty arises when restoring normal<br>
operation and line current shall be commutated from<br>
breaker 12 to breaker 10, since the breaker 10 path<br>
includes the inductor 8. In order to be able to open<br>
breaker 12 this breaker has to have sufficient breaking<br>
capability; a disconnect switch would not be sufficient.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a TCSC<br>
module having a reduced number of components as compared<br>
to prior art TCSC modules.<br>
The invention is based on the realization that by<br>
reconfiguring the other components of the TCSC module,<br>
one of the prior art breakers can be dispensed with.<br>
The above object, among others, is according to the<br>
invention attained by a TCSC module as defined by<br>
appended claim 1.<br>
Thus there is provided a thyristor controlled series<br>
capacitor module, comprising: a capacitor connectable in<br>
series with a power line; a thyristor valve connected in<br>
parallel with the capacitor; a breaker connected in<br>
parallel with the thyristor valve; and an inductor;<br>
which is characterized in that the inductor is connected<br>
in series with the capacitor; and the serial connected<br>
capacitor and inductor are connected in. parallel with<br>
the thyristor valve.<br>
Further preferred embodiments are defined by the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
By providing the inductor in series with the capacitor<br>
and by connecting the capacitor and inductor in parallel<br>
with the thyristor valve, the above mentioned problems<br>
are avoided or at least mitigated. A module is provided<br>
which comprises just one breaker, reducing cost and in-<br>
creasing reliability. Also, the problem with commutating<br>
currents from one breaker to another is also avoided<br>
since there is just one breaker.<br>
 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is now described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a prior art TCSC module,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a TCSC module according to the present<br>
invention, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of a TCSC module<br>
according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following a detailed description of preferred<br>
embodiments of a TCSC module according to the present<br>
invention will be given.<br>
Fig. 1 has been covered in the background section of the<br>
description and will not be described further herein.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a TCSC module according to the present<br>
invention. It is in many aspects similar to the prior<br>
art module of Fig. 1. Thus, the TCSC module comprises a<br>
capacitor 102 connected in series with a power line 104.<br>
In parallel with the capacitor 102 there is provided a<br>
thyristor valve 106. The thyristor valve in itself<br>
consists of two anti-parallel thyristors 106a, 106b in<br>
order to provide bi-directional functionality. Like<br>
prior art modules, the TCSC module of Fig. 2 can operate<br>
in essentially three different modes: bypassed mode,<br>
inserted mode, and under vernier control.<br>
The TCSC module is connected to the power line 104 by<br>
means of two disconnectors 107, 108. A third<br>
 <br>
disconnector 109 is provided in series with the power<br>
line.<br>
Also the TCSC module shown in Fig. 2 can be exposed to<br>
short circuit currents during line faults, resulting in<br>
stresses on the capacitor. To cope with this situation,<br>
a breaker 110 is provided in parallel with the thyristor<br>
valve 106. During short circuit faults, the breaker 110<br>
is closed. The current path in this situation through<br>
the breaker 110 and thyristor valve 106 is shown in the<br>
figure with a dashed line. The inductance 108 is in this<br>
situation included in the path of the capacitor<br>
discharge current and thereby limits this current to<br>
avoid detrimental current peaks.<br>
To allow permanent bypass of the module in cases of<br>
internal fault or during maintenance, the breaker 110 is<br>
provided in parallel with the capacitor 102, too. By<br>
this configuration, the breaker, when closed,<br>
effectively bypasses the capacitor. The current path in<br>
this situation through the breaker 110 is shown in the<br>
figure with a continuous line.<br>
In other words, when the breaker is closed, the path<br>
through the breaker forms a current path both during<br>
short circuit faults on the power line and during bypass<br>
operation of the module.<br>
Like in the prior art module shown in Fig. 1, the TCSC<br>
module shown in Fig. 2 comprises a varistor 114<br>
connected in parallel with the capacitor 102 to protect<br>
it in case of power surges.<br>
 <br>
The configuration of Fig. 2 consequently allows simpli-<br>
fication of the bypass breaker arrangement. Furthermore,<br>
the voltage stresses during a line fault are reduced<br>
when operating in thyristor bypass mode since the<br>
inductor is not included in the line current path.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of a TCSC module according<br>
to the invention, which is shown in Fig. 3, the varistor<br>
has been provided directly in parallel with the capa-<br>
citor. This provides the benefit of increased protection<br>
for the capacitor. In all other aspects, this embodiment<br>
is identical to the embodiment shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Preferred embodiments of a TCSC module according to the<br>
present invention has been described. A person skilled<br>
in the art realizes that these could be varied within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br>
