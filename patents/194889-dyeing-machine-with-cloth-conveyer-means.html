				<td>The present invention relates to dyeing machine with cloth conveyor means More particularly,  it relates to a dyeing machine, which comprises a conveyor and a set of cloth guide rollers for delivering cloth through a cloth passage for dyeing<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
According to conventional dyeing machines, the inserted piece of cloth is carried through a receiving chamber by the flowing force of provided dyeing solution and the gravity of the inserted piece of cloth Because the piece of cloth to be dyed is carried forwards by dyeing solution, much dyeing solution must be provided. When much dyeing solution is provided, much waste water will be produced When the inserted piece of cloth is circulated though the receiving chamber, it may easily be forced to angle. When dyeing different cloth, the flow rate must be properly controlled so that inserted cloth can be smoothly delivered so that inserted cloth can be smoothly delivered through the receiving chamber<br>
However, it is not easy to control the flow rate subject to the nature of the cloth to be dyed When a thick piece of cloth is put in the dyeing machine, it cannot be moved forwards smoothly Further, when the inserted piece of cloth is moved in the receiving chamber, it may be forced to rub against the inside wall of the receiving chamber, causing the fabric structure to be damaged<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished to provide a dyeing machine, which eliminates the aforesaid problems. According to one aspect of the<br>
2<br><br>
present invention, the dyeing machine compnses a receiving chamber, a cloth passage disposed in combination with the receiving chamber through which a piece of cloth is inserted and dyed, a jet nozzle suspended above a front end of the cloth passage and controlled to spray a dyeing solution for coloring the inserted piece of cloth, and a cloth guide roller suspended above said jet nozzle and turned to guide the inserted piece of cloth from the front end of the cloth passage through the jet nozzle toward a rear end of the cloth passage, wherein a motor-driven cloth conveyor is mounted within the receiving chamber at a bottom side and controlled to deliver the inserted piece of cloth through the cloth passage, a detector is mounted inside the receiving chamber to detect the movement of the inserted piece of cloth, and to cut off power supply from the motor-driven cloth conveyor when the inserted piece of cloth is jammed<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, two cloth guide means are mounted inside the receiving chamber adjacent to two opposite ends of the motor-driven cloth conveyor for guiding the inserted piece of cloth from the front end of the cloth passage to the cloth conveyor and from the cloth conveyor to the rear end of the cloth passage. According to still another aspect of the present invention, the cloth guide means can be cloth guide plates, or auxiliary belt conveyors<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings<br>
Fig 1 is a side plain view of a dyeing machine according to the present invention<br>
3<br><br>
Fig. 2 is a side plain view of an alternate form of the present invention, and<br>
Fig 3 is a front view in section of another alternate form of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a dyeing machine in accordance with the present invention is generally comprises a cylindrical receiving chamber 2, a cloth passage 3, a jet nozzle 1 suspended on the inside at the top, and a cloth guide roller 5 disposed in front of the jet nozzle 13 When a piece of cloth 7 is inserted into the dyeing machine, it is circulated through the cloth passage 3 and dyed<br>
Referring to figure 1 again; a cloth conveyor means 6 is mounted inside the receiving chamber 2 at the bottom, and controlled to deliver the inserted piece of cloth 7 The cloth conveyor means 6 comprises a set of means rollers 61, a mam conveying bell 62 mounted around the rollers 61. and a motor drive (not shown) driven to turn the main rollers 61 When the main rollers 61 are rotated by the motor drive, the main conveying belt 62 is turned to deliver the piece of cloth 7 A fixed front cloth guide plate 63 and a movable rear cloth guide plate 64 are installed in the receiving chamber 2 near two opposite ends of the cloth conveyor 6 The front cloth guide plate<br>
63 is fixedly fastened to the inside wall of the dyeing machine  The rear<br>
cloth guide plant 64 is pivoted to the inside wall of the dyeing machine The<br>
front cloth guide plate 63 is adapted to guide the inserted piece of cloth 7<br>
from the cloth passage 3 to the conveying belt 62 The rear cloth guide plate<br>
64 is adapted to guide the inserted piece of cloth 7 away from the conveying<br>
4<br><br>
belt 62 to the cloth passage 3.<br>
Further, a detector 65 is mounted inside the dyeing machine adjacent the fixed front cloth guide plate 63 If the inserted piece of cloth 7 is wrinkled and gathered together at the rear cloth guide plate 64 and unable to be delivered smoothly forwards, the rear cloth guide plate 64 will be forced by the inserted piece of cloth 7 to tilt to a certain angle When the rear cloth guide plate 64 tilts over a predetermined angle, the detector 65 is immediately triggered to cut off power supply from the motor drive of the cloth conveyor 6, permitting the wrinkled cloth section of the inserted piece of cloth 7 to be delivered forwards by the cloth guide roller 5 As soon as the inserted piece 7 is pulled straight, the rear cloth guide 64 immediately returns to its former position, and the detector 65 is triggered again to turn on the motor drive of the cloth conveyor 6, for permitting the inserted piece of the cloth 7 to be smoothly delivered through the cloth passage 3<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternate form of the present invention, in which two cloth guide means (63, 64) are mounted inside the receiving chamber 2 and obliquely aimed at two opposite ends of the cloth conveyor 6, and adapted to guide the inserted piece of cloth 7 from the front end of the cloth passage 3 to the conveying belt 62 and from the conveying belt 62 to the rear end of the cloth passage 3 continuously Each cloth guide means (63, 64) is comprised of two auxiliary rollet 66, and an auxiliary conveying belt 62 mounted around the roller 66<br>
Figure 3 shows another alternate form of the present invention, in which the receiving chamber, icferenced by 4, has an arched configuration, and the<br>
5<br><br>
rollers 61 of the cloth conveyor 6 are arranged along the smoothly curved bottom wall of the receiving chamber 4<br>
It is to be understood that the drawings are designed for purposes of illustration only, and are not intended as a definition of the limits and scope of the invention disclosed.<br>
