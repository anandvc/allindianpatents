				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A STEREO SIGNAL WITH<br>
ENHANCED PERCEPTUAL QUALITY<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to the creation<br>
of a stereo signal with enhanced perceptual quality and in<br>
particular, to how a signal represented by a mid-signal and<br>
a side-signal can be processed to create a stereo-signal<br>
with improved characteristics.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Recently, it has become feasible to store and playback lar-<br>
ger amounts of music on portable devices. As a consequence,<br>
the use of such devices became very popular, especially as<br>
the musical content can be played back via headphones eve-<br>
rywhere. Normally, the content to be played back has been<br>
mixed in stereo, i.e., to two independent channels. How-<br>
ever, the production has been performed for a playback via<br>
loudspeakers, using a common two-channel stereo-equipment.<br>
That is, the stereo-channels have been mixed in a music-<br>
studio such as to provide maximum reproduction quality,<br>
and, as far as possible, the spatial perception of the<br>
original auditory scene using two loudspeakers. However,<br>
listening to such stereo recordings via headphones leads to<br>
in-head localization of the sound, that is to a strongly<br>
disturbing spatial impression. In other words, virtual<br>
sound sources, which are meant to be localized somewhere<br>
between the two loudspeakers, are localized inside the lis-<br>
tener's head due to psychoacoustic properties of the human<br>
auditory system. This is the case since no crosstalk and no<br>
reflexions are perceived, which irritates the auditory sys-<br>
tem such that the sound sources is localized in the lis-<br>
tener's head. The irritation is caused since the auditory<br>
system is used to those signal properties, when content is<br>
played back via loudspeakers, or, more generally, transmit-<br>
ted via a "real" environment.<br>
Several methods and devices have been proposed to address<br>
this problem by processing the left and right channels<br>
prior to the playback via headphones. However, these ap-<br>
proaches, as for example the use of head related transfer<br>
functions, are computationally very complex. These ap-<br>
proaches try to stimulate the human auditory system to lo-<br>
calize the sound sources outside the head when playing back<br>
music with headphones by simulating the listening situation<br>
of loudspeakers in a room. That is, for example, a cross-<br>
talk sound path and the reflections of the room's walls are<br>
artificially added to the signal. To achieve a realistic<br>
simulation, filtering has to be applied to the left and the<br>
right channel to further take into account the properties<br>
of the listener's torso, head and pinnae. The more accurate<br>
this kind of simulation is, the more computational re-<br>
sources are required. When fairly well-sounding results are<br>
to be received with reduced complexity, those models are,<br>
for example, reduced to cross-talk, and, in some cases, to<br>
a very small number of wall reflections, which can be im-<br>
plemented by low-order filtering. The influence of the hu-<br>
man body itself can also be approximated by low order fil-<br>
ters. However, these filters have to be used on the di<br>
signal as well as on each of the reflected signals(as<br>
described in M.R. Schroeder: An Artificial Stereophonic<br>
feet Obtained from Using a Single Signal, 9th annual nv<br>
ing of the AES, preprint 14, 1957).<br>
Other methods have been proposed to provide a stereopher<br>
listening experience, even when only a monophonic signal<br>
provided. One approach is to feed the input signal (mono-<br>
phonic) to both channels and to create an attenuated and<br>
delayed representation of the signal, which is then added<br>
to the first channel and subtracted from the second chan-<br>
nel.<br>
Often, stereo signals are also transformed in to a mid-side<br>
representation containing a mid-signal (sum-signal) and a<br>
side-signal (difference signal). The sum-signal is formed<br>
by summing up the right channel and the left channel and<br>
the difference signal is formed by building the difference<br>
of the left channel and the right channel. In most musical<br>
stereo-signals, the virtual sound sources of highest rele-<br>
vance are those localized in front of the listener. This is<br>
the case, since these commonly represent the leading voice<br>
or the leading instrument in the recording. As these sound<br>
sources are intended to be localized between the loudspeak-<br>
ers of a two-channel setup, these signal components are<br>
present in the left channel as well in the right channel.<br>
Therefore, these important signals are mainly represented<br>
by a sum-signal (mid-signal) and hardly by a different sig-<br>
nal (side-signal). Therefore, when attempting to achieve a<br>
localization out of a listener's head, such a mid-side rep-<br>
resentation has to be processed with great care.<br>
In conventional out-of-head signal processing based on sum<br>
and difference signals, the sum-signals remain either un-<br>
processed, or are individually processed or filtered by<br>
specific filters. However, simply filtering the sum signal<br>
and the side signal separately, and redistributing the sig-<br>
nals to the left and right channels leads to an increase of<br>
the out-of-head localization or the perceived spatial width<br>
at the cost of an unadvantageously high computational com-<br>
plexity. Furthermore, an adding (subtracting) of a filtered<br>
sum signal to the difference signal, as performed by a con-<br>
ventional mid-side-upmixer, results in a shift of the per-<br>
ceived position of the virtual sound sources within the<br>
output signal.<br>
The international application 2005/098825 A1 relates to the<br>
task of increasing the encoding efficiency in a mid/side<br>
coding scheme at the cost of a moderate decrease in audio<br>
quality. The authors propose to not transmit the full side<br>
signal and to recover the missing portions of the side sig-<br>
nal from the mid signal within the decoder.<br>
The International Application 2004/030410 A1 relates to a<br>
method for processing audio signals and to an audio proc-<br>
essing system. In order to compensate for drop-outs in a<br>
side-signal of a mid-side representation, a portion of a<br>
mid-signal is extracted from the mid-signal, decorrelated<br>
and added to the side-signal prior to the reproduction.<br>
The US-Application 2004/0136554 A1 relates to a method and<br>
a device to process signals for stereo widening. In order<br>
to increase the quality of the signal, portions of a left-<br>
channel are decorrelated and added to the right-channel and<br>
portions of the right channel are decorrelated and added to<br>
the left channel prior to submission of the such altered<br>
audio signal.<br>
Given the conventional generation of stereo-signals and the<br>
changed playback habits, the need exists to provide a con-<br>
cept for the generation of a stereo signal with enhanced<br>
perceptual quality, which can be efficiently implemented.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Several embodiments of the present invention allow for the<br>
creation of a stereo signal with an enhanced perceptual<br>
quality based on a mid-signal (sum-signal) and a side-<br>
signal (difference signal). The out-of-head localization<br>
and the stage width of the sound signal is increased, when<br>
a signal portion of the mid-signal is mixed with a repre-<br>
sentation of the side-signal, provided that the signal por-<br>
tion of the mid-signal and the representation of the side-<br>
signal are, to a certain extent, mutually decorrelated. By<br>
performing the combination, an enhanced side-signal can be<br>
derived, which can be used as an input for a mid-side-<br>
upmixer creating a stereo-output-signal to be played back<br>
via headphones. By mixing parts of the mid-signal to the<br>
side-signal prior to upmixing, the perceptual width of the<br>
virtual audio sources in front of a listener's head can be<br>
increased, as a part of the signal is distributed to the<br>
side-channel containing information of sound sources not<br>
directly in front of the listener. However, in order to<br>
avoid a perceived left- or right-shift of the auditory<br>
scene or of the virtual sound sources, the signals to be<br>
combined are mutually decorrelated, in order to distribute<br>
constructive or destructive interference of the signal ir-<br>
regularly within the spectrum. To be more precise, after<br>
the decorrelation of the signal, different parts of the<br>
spectrum of the signals interfere differently. In order to<br>
achieve this, a decorrelator is adapted to generate a<br>
decorrelated representation of at least a portion of the<br>
mid-signal and/or a decorrelated representation of at least<br>
a portion of the side-signal.<br>
By using decorrelated representations of parts of the sig-<br>
nals which are mixed together with the side signal, the<br>
played back stereo signal has an enhanced perceptual qual-<br>
ity, in that the signal is no longer localized within the<br>
head, when listened to with headphones. In order to achieve<br>
the effect, a decorrelated representation of a portion of<br>
the mid-signal may be provided and mixed to the side-<br>
signal.<br>
According to further embodiments, a decorrelated represen-<br>
tation of at least a portion of the sum-signal is provided<br>
as well as a decorrelated representation of at least a por-<br>
tion of the side-signal. Both decorrelated representations<br>
are combined (mixed) with the side-signal or with a repre-<br>
sentation of the side-signal derived by modifying the pro-<br>
vided side-signal.<br>
According to a further embodiment, a portion of the mid-<br>
signal is combined with a representation of the side-signal<br>
wherein at least a portion of the side-signal is decorre-<br>
lated with respect to the portion of the mid-signal. This<br>
may be achieved by creating a decorrelated representation<br>
of the portion of the side-signal before combining the thus<br>
created decorrelated representation with the side-signal.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the high-frequency por-<br>
tions of the signals are decorrelated, in order to process<br>
only those frequency portions of an audio-signal, that<br>
cause, due to the relatively short wavelength, significant<br>
reflection-induced-effects to a listener. This avoids in-<br>
troduction of disturbing artifacts into low-frequency-parts<br>
of the signal.<br>
In further embodiments, audio processors implementing the<br>
above concept are used within audio decoders, such that a<br>
mid-side-representation of a two-channel signal created as<br>
an intermediate signal in a decoder can be directly proc-<br>
essed enhancing the perceptual quality of the generated<br>
stereo-signal. To this end, further embodiments of the pre-<br>
sent invention are adapted to process the mid-signal and<br>
the side-signal in a frequency domain, such that frequency<br>
representations of the respective signals can be directly<br>
processed without the need of retransforming them into a<br>
time domain representation. This can be of great benefit<br>
when, for example, audio decompressor are used, which pro-<br>
vide an intermediate signal being a mid-side-representation<br>
of an underlying stereo-signal within the frequency domain.<br>
That is, embodiments of the invention may be efficiently<br>
implemented within, for example, MP3 and AAC-decoders, or<br>
the like, such as to increase the perceptual quality of mo-<br>
bile playback devices providing the signal to headphones.<br>
That is, an audio decoder for generating a stereo signal<br>
with enhanced perceptual qualities comprising may comprise<br>
a signal provider for providing a mid-signal and a side-<br>
signal, the mid-signal representing a sum of original left<br>
and right channels and the side-signal representing a dif-<br>
ference of the original left and right channels; and an<br>
audio processor according to one of the embodiments de-<br>
scribed herein.<br>
Further embodiments of audio decoders may utilize a signal<br>
provider comprising an audio decompressor for generating<br>
the mid-signal and the side-signal by decompressing a com-<br>
pressed audio data stream.<br>
To summarize, several embodiments of the present invention<br>
use a novel audio processing method for generating stereo<br>
signals, which avoids localization inside the head when the<br>
generated signal is played back via headphones. The method<br>
yields this high perceptual quality, that is, the possibil-<br>
ity of generating a stereo signal with an advanced percep-<br>
tual quality, while keeping other properties of the signal,<br>
such as the spectral distribution and the transient behav-<br>
ior, perceptually unaffected. Furthermore, the spatial per-<br>
ception is improved in terms of out of head localization<br>
and stage width while preserving the distribution of the<br>
sound sources. Due to the low computational complexity, em-<br>
bodiments of the invention can be easily used on portable<br>
music playback devices, in spite of the limited processing<br>
power and power supply of those devices.<br>

Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of an audio processor 2 for gen-<br>
erating a stereo signal with enhanced perceptual quality 4,<br>
comprising a right-channel 4a and a left-channel 4b. The<br>
stereo signal 4 is generated based on a mid-signal 6a and a<br>
side-signal 6b, provided to the audio processor 2. It<br>
should be noted, that here and in the context of this ap-<br>
plication, the mid- and side-signals M and S are understood<br>
to be either the M- and S-signals created by summing up and<br>
building the difference of an original left and right chan-<br>
nel, or being a signal based on those M- and S-signals,<br>
that is, being modifications of same signals. The modifica-<br>
tions, however, are only based on the original mid- and<br>
side-signals. That is, a modified side-signal is generated<br>
using only the side-signal and a modified mid-signal is<br>
generated using only the mid-signal. To this end, modified<br>
mid-signals and side-signals are also referred to as repre-<br>
sentations of the mid-signal MR and the side-signal Sr.<br>
The audio processor 2 comprises a decorrelator 8, a signal<br>
combiner 10 and a mid-side-upmixer 12. The decorrelator 8<br>
receives the mid-signal 6a and the side-signal 6b as an in-<br>
put, or alternatively, representations of same signals. Al-<br>
ternatively, the decorrelator 8 may in some embodiments de-<br>
rive a representation of the mid-signal and side-signal 6b<br>
itself. The decorrelator is adapted to generate a decorre-<br>
lated representation of at least a portion of the mid-<br>
signal and/or a decorrelated representation of at least a<br>
portion of the side-signal. According to some embodiments,<br>
the portion of the signals, which is decorrelated, is a<br>
high-pass-filtered part of the original signals, such as to<br>
provide the processing only in those frequency ranges,<br>
where the processing yields a perceptual improvement.<br>
In alternative embodiments, optional representation genera-<br>
tors 42 and 44 may be present, which receive the original<br>
mid-signal 6a and the original side-signal 6b as an input<br>
and which create the representations of the mid-signal (MR)<br>
and the side-signal (SR) as well as the representations m<br>
and s provided to the decorrelators.<br>
The decorrelated representations derived by the decorrela-<br>
tor 8 are input into the signal combiner 10, which further-<br>
more receives the side-signal or a representation of the<br>
side signal SR. The signal combiner 10 derives an enhanced<br>
side-signal 14, based on a combination of the signals pro-<br>
vided to the signal combiner. According to one embodiment,<br>
the combination can be performed using the representation<br>
of the side-signal SR and a decorrelated representation of<br>
a portion of the mid-signal m+. According to a further em-<br>
bodiment, the combination can be based on the side-signal<br>
SR, a decorrelated representation of a portion of the side-<br>
signal s+ and a decorrelated representation of a portion of<br>
the mid-signal m+. According to a further embodiment, the<br>
combination can be based on the side-signal SR, a portion<br>
of the mid-signal m (which is not decorrelated) and a<br>
decorrelated representation of at least a portion of the<br>
side-signal s+.<br>
According to some embodiments, the portion of the sum-<br>
signal and the portion of the side-signal are corresponding<br>
signal portions, that is, for example, represent the same<br>
frequency range. That is, in deriving those portions, high-<br>
pass-filters using the same filter characteristics are<br>
used.<br>
The signal combiner 10 thus derives an enhanced side-signal<br>
14 (S'), which has a contribution of the mid-signal. This<br>
contribution and the side-signal are mutually decorrelated<br>
(at least in the frequency range of interest) such that<br>
possible constructive or destructive interferences are dis-<br>
tributed irregularly within the spectrum when the signal<br>
portions are combined subsequently in the mid-side upmixer<br>
12. The mid-side-upmixer 12 receives on the one hand the<br>
enhanced side-signal 14, and, on the other hand, the mid-<br>
signal Mr or a representation of the mid-signal 6a as an<br>
input. The mid-side upmixer derives the stereo signal 4<br>
having the enhanced perceptual quality, especially when<br>
played back by headphones.<br>
In several embodiments of the invention, the upmixer uses<br>
an upmixing rule, according to which the left-channel of<br>
the stereo signal is created by summing up the enhanced<br>
side-signal and the mid-signal. In these embodiments, the<br>
right-channel 4a is formed by building the difference be-<br>
tween the mid-signal 6a (or the representation of the mid-<br>
signal MR) and the enhanced side-signal 14.<br>
With the embodiment of an audio processor disclosed in Fig.<br>
1, signal portions of the mid-signal are distributed to the<br>
side-signal prior to an upmix. In other words, the process-<br>
ing of the mid-signal and the side-signal in the mid-side-<br>
signal-domain is interleaved, resulting in an out-of-head<br>
localization of the thus processed signal, which is hardly<br>
achievable using conventional mid-side-signal processing<br>
techniques when the computational complexity is an issue.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of conventional signal processing<br>
in which a stereo signal 20 (having a left channel 20a and<br>
a right channel 20b) is transformed into a mid-signal 22a<br>
and a side-signal 22b, using a conventional mid-side-<br>
synthesizer 24. The mid-signal 22a is filtered using a<br>
first filter 26a and the side-signal 22b is filtered using<br>
a second filter 26b. The filtered representations of the<br>
mid-signal 22a and the side-signal 22b are upmixed using a<br>
mid-side-upmixer 28 to derive a processed stereo-signal 30<br>
(having a left-channel L' 30a and a right-channel R' 30b.<br>
However, as the processing is not interleaved, a perceptual<br>
widening of the auditory scene or a localization out of a<br>
listener's head can hardly be achieved without signifi-<br>
cantly increasing the computational complexity of the sig-<br>
nal processing.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of the invention using a decor-<br>
related representation of a part of the mid-signal as well<br>
as a decorrelated representation of a part of the side-<br>
signal. The original stereo-signal 40 is transformed into a<br>
representation having a mid-signal 6a and a side-signal 6b,<br>
using a mid-side-synthesizer 24.<br>
The signal processor 2 operates on the mid-signal 6a and<br>
the side-signal 6b thus provided. The signal processor 2<br>
comprises a first representation generator 42 for the side-<br>
signal 6b and a second representation generator 44 for the<br>
mid-signal 6a. A signal combiner 4 6 of the audio processor<br>
2 comprises a first summation-node 4 6a and a second summa-<br>
tion-node 46b. The audio processor further comprises a mid-<br>
side upmixer 48, generating the stereo signal with enhanced<br>
perceptual quality 50 at the output of the audio processor<br>
2.<br>
The representation generators 42, 44 use their respective<br>
input signals, i.e., the mid-signal 6a and the side-signal<br>
6b to generate representations MR and Sr of those signals<br>
by adding or subtracting a high-pass-filtered signal por-<br>
tion of the input signals to the input signals themselves,<br>
thereby emphasizing or attenuating the high-frequency-<br>
portions of those signals. To this end, the first represen-<br>
tation generator 42 comprises a high-pass-filter 52, a<br>
first signal scaler 54a and a second signal scaler 54b, and<br>
a summation node 56. The second representation generator 44<br>
comprises a high-pass-filter 62, a third signal scaler 64a<br>
and a fourth signal scaler 64b, as well as a summation node<br>
66.<br>
The signal scalers 54a, 54b and 64a, 64b are operative to<br>
scale the signals at their inputs, i.e., to apply a scale<br>
factor to the signals by multiplying the signals with the<br>
scale factor. The high-pass-filter 52 of the first repre-<br>
sentation generator 42 receives a copy of the side-signal<br>
6b as its input and provides a high-pass-filtered signal<br>
portion SHi at its output. The high-pass-filtered signal<br>
portion SHi is input into the first signal scaler 54a,<br>
whereas the side-signal 6b, or a copy of the signal is in-<br>
put into the second signal scaler 54b.<br>
The scaling factors of the signal scalers 54a and 54b can<br>
be predetermined or may, in further embodiments, be subject<br>
to a user interaction. The summation node 56 receives the<br>
scaled high-pass-filtered signal portion SHi and the scaled<br>
side-signal to sum these signals, so as to provide a repre-<br>
sentation of the side-signal SR 70 at the output of the<br>
summation node 56 (the output of the first representation<br>
generator 42). In an analogous manner, the second represen-<br>
tation generator 44 provides a representation of the mid-<br>
signal MR 72 as its output.<br>
The audio processor further comprises a first decorrelation<br>
circuit 74 and a second decorrelation circuit 76. The first<br>
decorrelation circuit 74 comprises a scaler 74a, a decorre-<br>
lator 74b and a delay-circuit 74c and the second decorrela-<br>
tion circuit 76 comprises a sixth signal scaler 76a, a<br>
decorrelator 76b and a delay circuit 76c.<br>
It should be emphasized that the decorrelation structures<br>
74 and 76 are to be understood as mere examples of possible<br>
decorrelation structures or decorrelators. In particular, a<br>
delay structure (delay circuits 76c and 74c) is not neces-<br>
sarily required. Instead, the decorrelators 74b and 76b can<br>
implement a certain amount of delay itself. According to<br>
further embodiments, the delay may be omitted. As already<br>
indicated in the previous paragraphs, the signal portions<br>
to be combined should be mutually decorrelated. Therefore,<br>
the decorrelators 74b (decorr 2) and 76b (decorr 1) may be<br>
different, in order to provide mutually decorrelated sig-<br>
nals.<br>
The scale factors of the signal scalers 74a and 76a can be<br>
predetermined or be subject to user manipulation. The<br>
decorrelators 74b and 76b generate a signal, which is, to a<br>
certain extent, decorrelated from the signal at their in-<br>
put. That is, a maximum of the absolute value of the nor-<br>
malized cross-correlation between a signal at the input of<br>
the decorrelator and the signal output by the decorrelator<br>
will be significantly lower than 1. It may be noted that<br>
the precise implementation of the decorrelators is of minor<br>
importance, instead, different implementations of decorre-<br>
lators known in the art can be used and also arbitrary com-<br>
binations thereof. For example, various allpass-filters may<br>
be used. For example, a concatenation of second order IIR-<br>
filters could be used to provide a decorrelated representa-<br>
tion of the high-pass-filtered portion of the mid-signal<br>
and the side-signal. Each filter may have arbitrary filter<br>
characteristics, which could, for example, be generated us-<br>
ing a random generator. The decorrelation may be achieved<br>
with different kinds of decorrelators, as for example using<br>
reverberation algorithms, including for example, feedback<br>
delay networks. Feed-forward comb-filters and feed-back<br>
comb-filters may be used as well as allpass-filters, which<br>
could, for example, be combined from feed-forward and feed-<br>
back comb-filters. Another implementation could, for exam-<br>
ple, use random noise to filter the signals at the input of<br>
the decorrelators, so as to provide decorrelated signals.<br>
The decorrelation circuits 74 and 76 furthermore comprise<br>
delay-circuits 74c and 76c, which may apply an optional ad-<br>
ditional delay to the decorrelated signals generated by the<br>
decorrelators 74b and 76b. The decorrelation circuit 76<br>
provides a decorrelated representation of a high-pass-<br>
filtered-signal portion of the mid-signal M+ 82, whereas<br>
decorrelation circuit 74 provides a decorrelated represen-<br>
tation of a high-pass filtered signal portion of the side-<br>
signal s+ 84. In the particular example shown in Fig. 3,<br>
the signal combiner 46 combines the representation of the<br>
side-signal 70, the decorrelated representation of the por-<br>
tion of the side-signal 84 as well as the decorrelated rep-<br>
resentation of the portion of the mid-signal 82 by summing<br>
up these three components using the summation nodes 4 6a and<br>
46b. In the particular example of Fig. 3, the decorrelated<br>
representation of the portion of the mid-signal 82 and the<br>
decorrelated representation of the portion of the side-<br>
signal 84 are combined first, e.g. by summing both signals<br>
using summation node 4 6a. Then the thus combined signal is<br>
combined with the representation of the side-signal 70,<br>
e.g. by summing both signals using summation node 46b. It<br>
may be noted that summing up could also be modified by<br>
scaling of the signals to be summed up prior to the combi-<br>
nation (summation). By scaling with negative values, summa-<br>
tion could effectively also result in building a differ-<br>
ence. When deriving the enhanced side-signal 90, further<br>
decorrelation measures may additionally be implemented<br>
within the two summation nodes 46a and 46b.<br>
In order to avoid evenly spaced constructive or destructive<br>
interference for all parts of the spectrum and in order to<br>
widen the perceptual impression of the audio scene, decor-<br>
relator 74b is used to provide the decorrelated representa-<br>
tion of the side-signal 84 prior to the combination with<br>
the representation of the side-signal 70. In order to<br>
achieve the effect of out-of-head localization and spatial<br>
widening, the portion of the mid-signal, which is combined<br>
with the representation of the side-signal in order to form<br>
the enhanced side-signal, shall be decorrelated from the<br>
corresponding portion of the representation of the side-<br>
signal. This means that, when combining a high-pass-<br>
filtered portion MHi of the mid-signal with a high-pass-<br>
filtered portion SHi of the side-signal, the high-frequency<br>
portion SHi of the side-signal and the high-frequency por-<br>
tion MHi of the mid-signal should be decorrelated from each<br>
other. Optionally, both portions may be mutually decorre-<br>
lated from the representation of the Side-signal 70.<br>
However, alternate embodiments may directly combine the<br>
decorrelated representation of the mid-signal 82 with the<br>
representation of the side-signal 70, as these are mutually<br>
decorrelated due to decorrelator 76b.<br>
Furthermore, alternative embodiments may combine the high-<br>
pass-filtered signal portion MHi directly with a represen-<br>
tation of the side-signal, when the high-frequency portion<br>
of the representation of the side-signal is decorrelated,<br>
such as to provide mutual decorrelation of the respective<br>
signal parts.<br>
Given the previous alternatives, the filter characteristics<br>
of the high-pass-filters 52 and 62 may be identical as well<br>
as different.<br>
Furthermore, the scale factors of the signal scalers 54a,<br>
54b, 64a, 64b, 74a and 76a may vary within a wide scope.<br>
According to some embodiments, the scale factors are chosen<br>
such that the total energy of the signals M and S, i.e.,<br>
the side-signal and the mid-signal is preserved within the<br>
generation of the representation of the mid-signal 72 and<br>
the enhanced side-signal 90.<br>
When the effects of widening and out-of-head localization<br>
shall be increased, the scale factors may be chosen such<br>
that the enhanced side-signal 90 contains more energy or is<br>
louder than the side-signal 6b. In such a scenario the de-<br>
mand for energy preservation may require to attenuate the<br>
mid signal, i.e. to choose scale factors smaller than one.<br>
In case the phase shall be altered, appropriate scale fac-<br>
tors may be smaller than zero.<br>
Using an embodiment of an inventive audio processor, such<br>
as the one described in Fig. 3, a decorrelation of the high<br>
frequency part of the side-signal leads to a simple and ef-<br>
ficient simulation of cross-talk and the diffused sound<br>
field of a virtual listening room.<br>
According to some embodiments, it is, depending on the<br>
scale factor chosen, furthermore possible to reduce the<br>
low-frequency part of the mid-signal. This being a simple<br>
simulation of the cross-talk at low frequencies, where the<br>
sound waves are diffracted around the head of the listener.<br>
The incorporation of portions of the mid-signal into the<br>
out-of-head processing leads to a spatial extension of the<br>
front sources. Mixing of the decorrelated mid-signal m+ to<br>
the side-signal S allows improved widening of a stereo im-<br>
age. Furthermore, the processing is extremely efficient,<br>
while leading to naturally sounding out-of-head processing<br>
of high perceptual quality and low complexity. The effi-<br>
ciency may be even further increased when the decorrelation<br>
of the portion of the mid-signal M and the side-signal S is<br>
combined, as detailed in the subsequent and preceding em-<br>
bodiments.<br>
Summarizing, a specific embodiment of a signal processor<br>
can, in other words, be described as follows:<br>
Provide a mid-signal M and a side-signal S. These may be<br>
provided externally, or internally within the signal proc-<br>
essor, where original stereo signals or stereo channels L<br>
and R are summed up, such as to build the sum signal M and<br>
a difference signal S.<br>
Then, create a high-pass-filtered signal path Shi. Add an<br>
scaled (attenuated or amplified) copy of the high-pass-<br>
filtered signal path SHi to the attenuated main path S.<br>
Scale and decorrelate a copy of the high-pass-filtered sig-<br>
nal path SHi and/or delay this signal prior to adding it to<br>
the main path.<br>
Further, process the sum-signal M as follows:<br>
Create a high-pass-filtered signal path MHi of the mid-<br>
signal M. Attenuate a copy of the high-pass-filtered signal<br>
MHi and add same to the attenuated main path M. Attenuate<br>
and decorrelate a further copy of MHi and/or delay the<br>
same.<br>
Then combine the signals by adding the attenuated, decorre-<br>
lated and possibly delayed signal portion MHi to the main<br>
path of the different signal S.<br>
Finally, synthesize or create the output signals "L" and<br>
"R" by computing the sum or the difference of the main sig-<br>
nal path S and the main signal path M.<br>
As depicted in Fig. 4, the decorrelation of the high-<br>
frequency parts Mm, SHi may be partially processed in one<br>
step. That is because the embodiments utilize signals which<br>
are mutually decorrelated, whereas different setups to re-<br>
sult with decorrelated signals may be utilized.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the decorrelated signal portions m+ 82<br>
and s+ 84 of the high-frequency filtered signal portion MHi<br>
and Shi may be added by means of a summation node 4 6a prior<br>
to the application of a third decorrelator 92, which could<br>
furthermore be optionally followed by a delay circuit 94.<br>
The combination to form the enhanced side-signal may then<br>
be performed after a combination of the decorrelated sig-<br>
nals, as shown in Fig. 4. In order to guarantee mutually<br>
correlated signal portions, one of the three decorrelators<br>
74b, 76b, or 92 may be omitted in further embodiments of<br>
the further invention.<br>
A further decorrelation scheme is depicted in Fig. 5, util-<br>
izing a decorrelator 100 with multiple inputs. Using a<br>
decorrelator 100 with multiple inputs allows to provide the<br>
high-pass-filtered signal components MHi and SHi directly to<br>
the input of the decorrelator 100, which then performs the<br>
correlation and the combination of the generated signals,<br>
in accordance with, for example, the processing of Fig. 4 .<br>
To this end, the decorrelator 100 could be understood to be<br>
a black-box, implementing, for example, the signal process-<br>
ing of Fig. 4. The decorrelator 100 could furthermore be<br>
followed by a delay-circuit 94, if a delay functionality is<br>
not included within the decorrelator 100.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a decorrelator 92 or 100 may<br>
provide multiple outputs being decorrelated with respect to<br>
each other, i.e., multiple mutually decorrelated outputs.<br>
In such a scenario, the output signals may, according to<br>
further embodiments, be directly fed to the left and right<br>
channels or to the representation of the mid-signal or the<br>
enhanced side-signal.<br>
According to further embodiments, the decorrelation is per-<br>
formed in the spectral domain, such that the out-of-head<br>
processing, that is, the application of the inventive audio<br>
processors, can be efficiently included in the decoding of<br>
compressed audio signals, such as MP3 or AAC.<br>
This may be highly beneficial, when a mid-side-<br>
representation of a stereo-channel signal is generated<br>
within the decoding process and/or when the decoding is<br>
performed in the spectral domain or in the spectral repre-<br>
sentation of the signals. A typical application scenario<br>
would be the implementation of embodiments of signal proc-<br>
essors into portable music playback devices, such as for<br>
example, mobile phones or special multimedia playback de-<br>
vices.<br>
One example of such an implementation is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, music-data is stored or provided in an<br>
encoded representation 110 to a decoder 112, which decodes<br>
or decompresses music-data 110 to provide an input signal,<br>
which could, depending on the specific implementation, be a<br>
stereo signal comprising a left-channel and a right-channel<br>
or a mid-side-representation having a mid-channel and a<br>
side-channel. Furthermore, these representations can be<br>
provided in a time domain as well as in a spectral domain.<br>
In the signal processing or the reconstruction of audio<br>
data shown in Fig. 6, a user control allows access to some<br>
parameters of the system, as described below.<br>
The input signal 114 is input into a bypass circuit, which,<br>
depending on the user input of the user control 116, by-<br>
passes an embodiment of an inventive signal processor 2, or<br>
feeds or forwards the signal 140 to the signal processor 2.<br>
The signal processor 2 provides the possibility to enhance<br>
the perceptual quality of the stereo signal, independent of<br>
its parameterization, i.e., regardless of the operation in<br>
the time- or the frequency-domain. When the signal is fed<br>
along a bypass-path 120, the unprocessed signal may be in-<br>
put into an optional equalizer 122, used to modify the sig-<br>
nal dependent on user parameters provided by user control<br>
116, so as to provide a headphone signal 124 at the output<br>
of the device. If, however, the bypass steers the signal to<br>
be input into the signal processor 2, out-of-head process-<br>
ing can be performed to derive a perceptually enhanced ste-<br>
reo-signal.<br>
According to the embodiment of Fig. 6, the operation pa-<br>
rameters such as scale factors or the threshold frequencies<br>
of high-pass filters of the signal processor 2 may be in-<br>
fluenced or controlled by a user control 116, providing the<br>
control or steer values to a control value processing cir-<br>
cuit 126, which may be implemented to cross-check the user<br>
input and to furthermore modify the user input parameters,<br>
such as to, for example, provide energy preservation of the<br>
processing.<br>
After having been processed by the signal processor 2, an<br>
optional post-processing may be performed by a post-<br>
processor 128, which is optionally steerable by a user in-<br>
put provided via user control 116. Such post-processing,<br>
for example, comprises equalization or dynamics processing<br>
such as dynamic range compression or the like.<br>
Summarizing, implementing signal processors into portable<br>
devices, in which musical content is usually stored in a<br>
compressed manner has several major advantages. After de-<br>
coding of the compressed audio content, embodiments of in-<br>
ventive signal processors may be used, either to the PCM-<br>
data or to a frequency representation of same. Alterna-<br>
tively, the method can be integrated into the decoding of<br>
the compressed audio signals directly, either in the spec-<br>
tral or in the time domain. Optionally, a possibility to<br>
control the method or the signal processor may be imple-<br>
mented such as to switch the processing by the signal proc-<br>
essor on and off. Furthermore, the parameters such as the<br>
scale factors used by the signal processors, may be adjust-<br>
able by the user. To this end, a suitable set of control<br>
values may be provided, which are converted into the appro-<br>
priate parameters by a processing step, that is, by a con-<br>
trol value processor 126.<br>
Furthermore, an optional post-processing, such as equaliza-<br>
tion or dynamics processing, may be applied to the improved<br>
signal. If the device itself provides a user-controlled<br>
equalization algorithm, this algorithm may additionally be<br>
applied to the output of the signal processor and/or to the<br>
output of the optional post-processing.<br>
The output of the complete process chain, i.e., the output<br>
of an embodiment of a signal processor, or of the post-<br>
processing and/or the user-controlled equalization, is pro-<br>
vided to the headphone plug of the music playback device.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an embodiment of a method for generating a<br>
stereo signal 4 with enhanced perceptual quality, using a<br>
mid-signal 6a and a side-signal 6b. In a decorrelation step<br>
150, a decorrelated representation of at least a portion of<br>
the mid-signal 152 and/or a decorrelated representation of<br>
at least a portion of the side-signal 154 is created.<br>
In an enhancement step 160, an enhanced side-signal 162<br>
(S') is created, combining a representation (SR) of the<br>
side-signal 164 with the decorrelated representation of the<br>
portion of the mid-signal 152, with the decorrelated repre-<br>
sentation of the portion of the mid-signal 152 and the<br>
decorrelated representation of the portion of the side-<br>
signal 154, or with the portion of the mid-signal 168 and<br>
the decorrelated representation of the portion of the side-<br>
signal 154.<br>
In an upmixing step 169, the stereo signal 4 with enhanced<br>
perceptual quality is derived, using in the enhanced side-<br>
signal 162 and a representation of the mid-signal MR.<br>
In an optional representation generation step 148, a repre-<br>
sentation of the mid -and/or the side-signals MR and SR as<br>
well as signal portions m and s of the mid-signal 6a and<br>
the side-signal 6b may be generated. Alternatively, the<br>
generation of those signal portions may be directly imple-<br>
mented within the remaining processing steps operating on<br>
the not pre-processed signals. That is, the step of the<br>
representation generation may be implemented within other<br>
steps of the method for generating a stereo signal.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be per-<br>
formed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disk, DVD or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system such that the inventive methods are per-<br>
formed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore, a<br>
computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer pro-<br>
gram product runs on a computer. In other words, the inven-<br>
tive methods are, therefore, a computer program having a<br>
program code for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>

decorrelated representation of the portion of the<br>
side-signal; and<br>
upmixing (169) the representation of the mid-signal<br>
and the enhanced side-signal to derive the stereo<br>
signal with enhanced perceptual quality (180).<br>
19. Method for generating a stereo signal with enhanced<br>
perceptual quality (4) using a mid-signal (6a) and a<br>
side-signal (6b), the mid-signal representing a sum of<br>
original left and right channels and the side-signal<br>
representing a difference of the original left and<br>
right channels, comprising:<br>
generating a decorrelated representation (150) of at<br>
least a portion of the mid-signal and/or a<br>
decorrelated representation of at least a portion of<br>
the side-signal;<br>
generating a representation of the side-signal (148)<br>
using the side-signal and a high-pass-filtered signal<br>
portion of the side-signal;<br>
generating an enhanced side-signal (160) combining a<br>
representation of the side-signal with the<br>
decorrelated representation of the portion of the mid-<br>
signal; and<br>
upmixing (169) the representation of the mid-signal<br>
and the enhanced side-signal to derive the stereo<br>
signal with enhanced perceptual quality.<br>
20. Computer program having a program code for performing,<br>
when running on a computer, a method for generating a<br>
stereo signal with enhanced perceptual quality in<br>
accordance with claims 18 or 19.<br>
<br>
A stereo signal with enhanced perceptual quality using a<br>
mid-signal and a side-signal, can be generated, when a enhanced<br>
side signal is created prior to the upmix of the<br>
stereo signal. A decorrelated representation of at least a<br>
portion of the sum signal and/or a decorrelated representation<br>
of at least a portion of the side-signal is generated.<br>
The enhanced side-signal is generated combining a representation<br>
of the side-signal with the decorrelated representation<br>
of the portion of the mid signal, with the decorrelated<br>
representation of the side-signal and the decorrelated<br>
representation of the portion of the mid-signal or<br>
with the portion of the mid-signal and the decorrelated representation<br>
of the portion of the side-signal. The stereo<br>
signal with enhanced perceptual quality is created using a<br>
representation of the mid-signal and the enhanced side-signal.</td>
