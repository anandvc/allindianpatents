FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a load interrupter for an encapsulated<br>
gas-insulated switchgear having at least one contact system<br>
that comprises a fixed contact arrangement as well as a moving<br>
contact arrangement, and a permanent magnet system assigned to<br>
the fixed contact arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Such a load interrupter is disclosed in EP 0 296 915 B1. The<br>
rotary load interrupter disclosed there comprises two<br>
diametrically opposite stationary contacts as fixed contact<br>
arrangement and, as moving contact arrangement, a rotating<br>
knife arranged on a switching shaft. In the case of this rotary<br>
load interrupter, permanent magnets are arranged in each case<br>
as permanent magnet system in the fixed contacts. This<br>
arrangement of the permanent: magnets effects a displacement of<br>
an arc that is produced during opening of the contact system,<br>
doing so in such a way that a base of the arc is displaced by a<br>
magnetic blowout into a shadow position on the fixed contact<br>
arrangement, thus preventing reignition after the natural quenching of the arc<br>
after a current zero.<br><br>
GB2224885 describes an arc interrupter mounted in a housing between two<br>
conductors , and comprises a fixed contact , a movable contact mounted for<br>
guided movement between a make position and a break position, a fixed arcing<br>
electrode connected to each of the fixed and movable contacts one or more<br>
further fixed electrodes positioned between the other two electrodes and one<br>
or more arc-driving permanent magnets which are coaxial with arcing surfaces<br>
of the electrodes . The contacts are located outside their respective electrodes .<br>
During opening of the interrupter an arc is struck between contacts after which<br>
it moves between surfaces then progressively also between the other opposite<br>
arcing surfaces until it terminates on surface . The permanent magnets produce<br>
magnetic flux which interacts with the arc between the arcing surfaces so that<br>
the arc is driven around the axis . The movement of the arc assists in<br>
extinguishing the arc at an appropriate current zero.<br>
GB2218262 teaches an electric switch which has an arc interrupter mounted in a<br>
housing between two main conductors . The interrupter comprises a fixed<br>
contact, a fixed electrode which forms part of contact defining a first arcing<br>
surface, a second fixed or pivotable electrode defining a second arcing surface,<br>
a permanent magnet and a movable contact which may also comprise the<br>
second electrode, the arcing surfaces and the permanent magnet<br><br>
being coaxial with one another when the contacts, are open, and the contact<br>
being mounted for angular movement, about a pivot axis between a make<br>
position and a break position. During opening of the interrupter, an arc is struck<br>
between the contacts after which it moves between arcing surfaces. The<br>
permanent magnet produces magnetic flux which interacts with the arc so that<br>
the arc is driven around an axis in the annular gap between the surfaces . The<br>
movement of the arc assists in extinguishing the arc at an appropriate current<br>
zero.<br>
EP0088167 describes a gas-filled switch with an improved arc extinguishing<br>
characteristics. Such gas-filled switch comprises a gas-filled casing, a pair of<br>
electrodes disposed in the casing, a conductive retaining ring which encircles at<br>
least one of the electrodes, a permament magnet of a cylindrical configuration<br>
mounted on the retaining ring, a conductive cylindrical body disposed in one end<br>
opening of the retaining ring, and an arc-drive coil encircling the conductive<br>
cylindrical body and having one end connected to the conductive cylindrical body<br>
and other end connected to the electrode.; Due to such construction, one root of<br>
an arc generated between the electrodes is moved from one electrode to the<br>
conductive cylindrical body so that the other root of the arc is subjected to the<br>
magnetic flux of the permanent magnet while the previous<br><br>
one root of the arc is subjected to the magnetic flux of the arc-drive coil so as to<br>
extinguish the arc during the rotation of the arc.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to design a load<br>
interrupter of the type mentioned at the beginning that has a<br>
simple and cost effective design in conjunction with a high<br>
switching capacity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by virtue of<br>
the fact that the permanent magnet system is kept electrically<br>
connected to the fixed contact arrangement on its outside in<br>
such a way that<br><br>
an arc produced during opening of the load interrupter extends<br>
to the permanent magnet system.<br>
In the case of such an arrangement of the permanent magnet<br>
system on the fixed contact arrangement, an arc quenching<br>
device for the load interrupter is designed in a simple way<br>
because the permanent magnet system is fitted on the outside on<br>
the fixed contact arrangement without a special configuration<br>
of the latter.<br>
In a further preferred refinement, the permanent magnet system<br>
is arranged with its bottom side facing an arc produced during<br>
opening of the contact system. Such an arrangement ensures an<br>
interaction of the arc with the magnetic field of the permanent<br>
magnet system in a simple way.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment,the permanent magnet system is<br>
arranged on the outside of the fixed contact arrangement in a<br>
region between a first limit position determined by a movement<br>
path of the moving contact arrangement, and a second limit<br>
position determined by the fixed contact arrangement. Such an<br>
arrangement ensures a simple transfer of the arc from the fixed<br>
contact arrangement to the permanent magnet system.<br>
In another advantageous refinement, the ring-shaped permanent<br>
magnet is arranged in such a way that it encloses the fixed<br>
contact. In the case of such an arrangement, as well, a<br>
transfer of the arc from the fixed contact arrangement to the<br>
permanent magnet system is easily enabled.<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, the permanent<br>
magnet system is arranged at an angle between 65° and 75° to<br>
the alignment of the fixed contact arrangement. A number<br><br>
of experiments have determined that such an angle is<br>
particularly advantageous for the transfer of the arc from the<br>
fixed contact arrangement to the permanent magnet system.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a follow on contact is<br>
arranged articulated on the moving contact arrangement, an<br>
electrical connection being formed between the follow on<br>
contact and the permanent magnet system up to an opening limit<br>
angle between the fixed contact arrangement and the moving<br>
contact arrangement, and in the event of a larger angle than<br>
the opening limit angle, the electrical connection between the<br>
follow on contact and the permanent magnet system is<br>
interrupted. Such a follow or contact advantageously ensures<br>
burning of the arc between the permanent magnet system and the<br>
follow on contact.<br>
In a further refinement, with closed contact system the follow<br>
on contact bears against the fixed contact arrangement and,<br>
upon opening of the contact system with retention of the<br>
electrical connection to the fixed contact arrangement, changes<br>
to the permanent magnet system, and cancels the electrical<br>
connection when the opening limit angle is reached. In the case<br>
of such an arrangement, a removal of material on the fixed<br>
contact arrangement by the arc is advantageously completely<br>
avoided.<br>
In a preferred refinement, with closed contact system the<br>
follow on contact bears against the permanent magnet system<br>
and, when the opening limit angle is reached, it cancels the<br>
electrical connection. Such a design advantageously completely<br>
prevents the fixed contact arrangement from being loaded by the<br>
arc.<br><br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in a further<br>
variant by virtue of the fact that a follow on contact with<br>
permanent magnet system arranged thereon is arranged<br>
articulated on the moving contact arrangement, an electrical<br>
connection being formed between the follow on contact and the<br>
fixed contact arrangement up to an opening limit angle between<br>
the fixed contact arrangement and the moving contact<br>
arrangement, and in the even" of a larger angle than the<br>
opening limit angle, the electrical connection between the<br>
follow on contact and the fixed contact arrangement is<br>
interrupted. An arc quenching device for the load interrupter<br>
is formed in a simple way with the aid of such an arrangement<br>
of the permanent magnet system on the fixed contact<br>
arrangement, because the permanent magnet system is arranged on<br>
the follow on contact in a simple way without a special<br>
configuration of the fixed contact arrangement. In the case of<br>
this embodiment, the arc advantageously does not load the<br>
moving contact arrangement at all.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the permanent magnet system<br>
comprises a rotationally symmetrical permanent magnet that lies<br>
in a covering made from conducting material. Such a permanent<br>
magnet advantageously forms a magnetic field that has regions<br>
with a field running parallel to the surface of the magnet, as<br>
a result of which a Lorenz force acts on the arc produced<br>
during opening of the contact system in such a way that the arc<br>
is caused to rotate along the rotationally symmetrical<br>
permanent magnet, and in this case the covering prevents<br>
destruction of the permanent magnet in a simple way, on the one<br>
hand, and on the other hand the electrical connection to the<br>
fixed contact arrangement is easily formed.<br><br>
In a preferred refinement, the covering is a pan formed from a<br>
nonmagnetic metal, and shields the permanent magnet at the<br>
sides facing the arc. Nonmagnetic metals, for example copper or<br>
zinc, are advantageous for forming a shield that protects the<br>
permanent magnet against destruction by the arc and is<br>
electrically connected to the fixed contact arrangement.<br>
In an expedient refinement, the pan is closed on a side averted<br>
from the arc by means of a closing plate. Such a closing plate,<br>
which is preferably formed from iron, offers a simple, cost<br>
effective possibility of closing the pan for the purpose of<br>
protecting the permanent magnet. In addition, the closing plate<br>
magnifies the effective magnetic field by means of the magnetic<br>
yoke.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the covering is of toroidal<br>
design and accommodates a ring-shaped permanent magnet. Such a<br>
covering advantageously shields the sides of the permanent<br>
magnet that face the arc, in order to prevent destruction of<br>
the permanent magnet.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a fastening means has a<br>
fastening region for holding the permanent magnet system on the<br>
respective fixed contact arrangement, and a support region for<br>
the covering of the permanent magnet system, the support region<br>
comprising an arc movement path. Such a fastening means is<br>
particularly advantageous, because it means that, on the one<br>
hand, an electrical connection between the covering of the<br>
permanent magnet system and the fixed contact arrangement is<br>
enabled and that, on the other hand, an arc movement path has<br>
already been formed in a particularly advantageous fashion by<br>
the support<br><br>
region such that the permanent magnet system and, in<br>
particular, the covering are protected by the arc movement path<br>
of the support region against being burned by the arc.<br>
In a further refinement, the covering comprises a basic part<br>
having a base and a cylindrical wall as well as a cover plate<br>
with a smaller diameter than that of the hollow cylindrical<br>
wall, a central through opening being provided in the basic<br>
part and in the cover plate. Such a covering advantageously<br>
creates a magnetic yoke for the permanent magnet system such<br>
that a strong radial magnetic field is formed for accelerating<br>
a base of an arc. This is supported with particular advantage<br>
as a result of the cover plate and hollow cylindrical wall<br>
having different radii such that a gap is formed between them<br>
that further amplifies the radial magnetic field. The covering<br>
is fastened on the fastening means in a simple way by means of<br>
the central through opening.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, provided for the permanent<br>
magnet system is an insulating cover that comprises a collar<br>
with a cutout, and a lid part, which are a capable of latching<br>
tightly on the fastening means with the aid of latching means.<br>
Such an insulating cover provides a further advantageous<br>
protection of the permanent magnet system and the covering,<br>
because no arc can burn on the insulating cover made from a<br>
plastic, and in this case the cutout that is located in the<br>
region of the fixed contact arrangement in the mounted state<br>
advantageously facilitates the transfer to the arc movement<br>
path of an arc produced upon a separation of the moving<br>
contacts from the fixed contacts.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the permanent magnet is a ring-<br>
shaped magnet with axial magnetization. Such a magnet is cost<br>
effective, and advantageously has a magnetic field that<br>
comprises a number of regions with field lines running parallel<br>
to the surfaces of the magnet. <br>
In another preferred embodiment, the permanent magnet is a<br>
ring-shaped magnet with radial magnetization. Such a magnet has<br>
a magnetic field with regions of field lines running parallel<br>
to the surfaces of the magnet.<br>
In an advantageous refinement, the permanent magnet is formed<br>
from a neodymium boron iron compound. Such a permanent magnet<br>
advantageously offers a high value of the magnetic field<br>
strength and a large demagnetization resistance.<br>
In another preferred refinement, the permanent magnet is formed<br>
from a samarium cobalt compound. Such a permanent magnet can<br>
advantageously be used at relatively high temperatures.<br>
In a further preferred refinement, the permanent magnet is<br>
formed from a hard ferrite. Hard ferrites are advantageously<br>
cost effective in forming permanent magnets. Strontium ferrite<br>
or barium ferrite are particularly preferred hard ferrites.<br>
The invention further relates to a permanent magnet system for<br>
a load interrupter that is provided for an encapsulated gas<br>
insulated switchgear having at least one contact system that<br>
comprises a fixed contact arrangement as well as a moving<br>
contact<br><br>
arrangement, which permanent magnet system is assigned to the<br>
fixed contact arrangement.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop such a<br>
permanent magnet system in such a way that it enables a simple<br>
and cost effective design of the load interrupter in<br>
conjunction with a high switching capacity.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in a<br>
permanent magnet system by virtue of the fact that the<br>
permanent magnet system has an external fastening means for<br>
holding the permanent magnet system on the respective fixed<br>
contact arrangement and for electrical connection to the fixed<br>
contact arrangement.<br>
Such an arrangement of the permanent magnet system on the fixed<br>
contact arrangement easily forms an arc quenching device for<br>
the load interrupter, because the permanent magnet system is<br>
fitted on the outside on the fixed contact arrangement.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a fastening means has a fastening<br>
region for holding the permanent magnet system on the<br>
respective fixed contact arrangement, and a support region for<br>
the covering of the permanent magnet system, the support region<br>
comprising an arc movement path.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a covering comprises a basic<br>
part having a base and a hollow cylindrical wall as well, as a<br>
cover plate with a smaller diameter than that of the hollow<br>
cylindrical wall, a central through opening being provided in<br>
the basic part and in the cover plate.<br><br>
In a further refinement of the invention, provided for the<br>
permanent magnet system is an insulating cover that comprises a<br>
collar with a cutout, and a lid part, which are capable of<br>
latching tightly on the fastening means with the aid of<br>
latching means.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows an inventive load interrupter 1 for a gas<br>
insulated switchgear, in particular having SF6 or SF6 mixtures<br>
as insulating gas, the encapsulation of which is not<br>
illustrated in the figure, having a fixed contact arrangement 2<br>
that comprises fixed contacts 3, 4 and 5. The fixed contacts 3,<br>
4 and 5 are mounted on a carrier 6, a conducting connection<br><br>
being formed to a busbar arrangement (not illustrated in thefigure). The load<br>
interrupter 1 further comprises a moving contact arrangement 7 with moving<br>
contacts 8, 9, 10. The moving contacts 8, 9 and 10 in the present exemplary<br>
embodiment are designed as double knife moving contacts and are fastened on<br>
a switching shaft 11 that is rotatably supported on a carrier 12<br>
and is driven by means of a drive apparatus (not illustrated).<br>
Further-<br><br>
more, a grounding contact arrangement 13 is provided with<br>
grounding contacts 14, 15 and 16. The fixed contacts 3, 4 and 5<br>
are fully rounded on their sides 17, 18, 19 facing the moving<br>
contacts 8, 9 and 10, just as are the grounding contacts 14,<br>
15, 16 on their sides 20, 21, 22, and so it is easily possible<br>
to close the contact system composed of the fixed contact<br>
arrangement 2 and moving contact arrangement 7, and of the<br>
grounding contact arrangement 1.3 and moving contact arrangement<br>
7. Provided on the fixed contact arrangement 2 is a permanent<br>
magnet system 23 with permanent magnets 24, 25, 26 that are<br>
respectively shielded on their sides facing the moving contact<br>
arrangement 7 by means of coverings in the form of pans 27, 28,<br>
29, and are closed on their side averted from the moving<br>
contact arrangement 7 by means of closing plates 30, 31, 32<br>
that are produced from iron, for example. The pans 27, 28, 29<br>
are connected to the fixed contacts 3, 4, 5 in an electrically<br>
conducting fashion with the aid of fastening means 33, 34, 35.<br>
The position, illustrated in figure 1, of the load interrupter<br>
corresponds to a disconnected position in which the moving<br>
contact arrangement 7 is not connected in a conducting fashion<br>
either to the fixed contact arrangement 2 or to the grounding<br>
contact arrangement 13. By means of the drive apparatus (not<br>
illustrated in the figure), the moving contact arrangement 7<br>
can be pivoted via the switching shaft 11 between a position in<br>
which the moving contact arrangement 7 forms a conducting<br>
connection with the fixed contact arrangement 2, and a position<br>
in which the moving contact arrangement 7 forms a conducting<br>
connection to the grounding contact arrangement 13.<br>
If, with a closed contact system with a conducting connection<br>
between the fixed contact arrangement 2 and the moving contact<br>
arrangement 7, there is triggered via the drive apparatus and<br>
the switching shaft 11 a switching operation in the case of<br>
which the moving contact arrange-<br><br>
ment 7 is disconnected from the fixed contact arrangement 2, an<br>
arc is produced during this disconnection operation between the<br>
moving contacts 8, 9, 10 and the fixed contacts 3, 4, 5. This<br>
arc is quenched during a following current zero. The quenching<br>
of the arc, and thus the switching capacity of the load<br>
interrupter 1, are ensured in this case by the permanent magnet<br>
system 23 on the fixed contact system 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows a detail view of a contact system of the load<br>
interrupter 1 from figure 1, with the fixed contact 3 and the<br>
moving contact 8, as well as the permanent magnet system 23<br>
with the associated permanent magnet 24, which is arranged in<br>
the pan 27. The permanent magnet 24 is covered by the closing<br>
plate 30 on its side averted from the moving contact 8. The pan<br>
27 with the closing plate 30 is fastened with the aid of the<br>
fastening element 33 on the fixed contact 3, to which it is<br>
electrically connected. In the position of figure 2, the<br>
operation disconnecting the moving contact 8 and fixed contact<br>
3 is already so far advanced that an arc initially burning<br>
between the moving contact 8 and the fixed contact 3 has<br>
already jumped over to the pan 27 and continues to burn<br>
thereon. Owing to the permanent magnet 24 arranged in the pan<br>
27 and to its magnetic field, there acts on the arc a force<br>
that causes it to rotate on a circular track. Owing to the<br>
rotation of the arc along the circular surface, a local erosion<br>
or a local removal of material is greatly reduced and reliable<br>
quenching at the next current zero is ensured.<br>
Figure 3 shows a ring-shaped permanent magnet 24 with axial<br>
magnetization, the respective poles of which are denoted by S<br>
and N, and corresponding field lines of the magnetic field<br><br>
are denoted by M. As is to be seen from figure 3, in the case<br>
of such an arrangement three regions I, II, III are formed in<br>
which the field lines run parallel to the surface of the<br>
permanent magnet 24. If a current flows in a direction of the<br>
permanent magnet as, for example, in the case of a burning arc,<br>
this current is subjected by means of the magnetic field to a<br>
Lorenz force that effects a rotation of the arc about the<br>
rotation axis of the permanent magnet 24. Instead of the ring-<br>
shaped permanent magnet 24 with axial magnetization, it is also<br>
possible to use a ring-shaped permanent magnet with a radial<br>
magnetization that likewise has regions with field lines<br>
running parallel to the surface of the permanent magnet.<br>
By way of example, figure 4 shows various fastening positions<br>
of the permanent magnet system 23 on the fixed contact 3 which,<br>
in figure 4, is conductingly connected to the moving contact 8.<br>
Denoted by C and illustrated by dashes is the movement path of<br>
the moving contact 8 during a switching operation in the case<br>
of which the contact system composed of the fixed contact 3 and<br>
moving contact 8 is disconnected. This movement path C<br>
determines a lower first limit position D that defines the<br>
position nearest the moving contact 8 for the permanent magnet<br>
system 23. The fixed contact 3 defines a second limit position<br>
E in which the permanent magnet system 23 can be fastened to<br>
the nearest fixed contact 3. In the positions D and E, the<br>
permanent magnet system is illustrated with a line that is dash<br>
and dotted or dashed, respectively. F denotes a fastening<br>
position for the permanent magnet system 23 at an angle a to a<br>
horizontal axis of the load interrupter.<br><br>
The position F defined by the angle a constitutes a preferred<br>
arrangement position for the permanent magnet system 23<br>
relative to the alignment of the fixed contact 3 of the fixed<br>
contact arrangement 2, it being possible to select the angle a<br>
between 65° and 75° to the alignment of the fixed contact<br>
arrangement 2.<br>
Illustrated in figure 5 is a further embodiment for fastening<br>
the permanent magnet system 23 on the fixed contact 3 in the<br>
case of which the ring-shaped permanent magnet 24 is shielded<br>
in the direction of the moving contact 8 or the movement path C<br>
of the moving contact 8 by a toroidal covering 27, bearing<br>
against the ring-shaped permanent magnet, both on its outside,<br>
on its bottom side and also on its inside.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of an inventive load<br>
interrupter 1 in the case of which a follow on contact 36 is<br>
arranged articulated on the moving contact 8 by means of an<br>
articulation 37. Illustrated by dashes is the moving contact<br>
for a closed contact system, and the solid illustration relates<br>
to an open contact system. In this case, the follow on contact<br>
36 is attached by means of a suitable spring mechanism (not<br>
illustrated in the figure), for example a compression spring,<br>
that cooperates with a stop element on the moving contact 8<br>
such that, in the event of a. disconnection operation of the<br>
contact system composed of the moving contact 8 and fixed<br>
contact 3, the follow on contact 36 maintains via the spring<br>
element an electrical connection between the moving contact 9<br>
and the fixed contact 3, while the moving contact 8 or the free<br>
end thereof is already removed from the fixed contact 3.<br>
Finally, during the movement of the moving contact 8 along the<br>
movement path C the follow on contact 36 is hindered in its<br>
further movement by means of the stop element (not illustrated<br>
in the figure) , such that when a specific limit angle is<br>
reached the electrical<br><br>
connection between the follow on contact 36 and the fixed<br>
contact 3 or the permanent magnet system 23 is also<br>
interrupted. In this case, the arc burns between the follow on<br>
contact 36 and the permanent magnet 23 and is quenched in the<br>
next current zero.<br>
Figure 7 shows a further embodiment of an inventive load<br>
interrupter in a side view and a front view in the case of<br>
which a follow on contact 38 is arranged on the moving contact<br>
8 by means of an articulation 39 and of the abovementioned<br>
spring elements (not illustrated) and stop elements. Arranged<br>
at a lateral spacing on the fixed contact 3 is a permanent<br>
magnet system 40 that is electrically connected to the fixed<br>
contact 3 via a fastening bush 41. As in the case of the<br>
exemplary embodiment of figure 6, during the disconnection<br>
operation the contact is firstly maintained via the follow on<br>
contact 38 and the pan of the permanent magnet system 40, while<br>
upon a limit angle being exceeded during the disconnection<br>
between the moving contact 8 and fixed contact 3 the follow on<br>
contact 38 is also finally disconnected from the permanent<br>
magnet system 40, and the arc burns between the permanent<br>
magnet 40 and the follow on contact 38 and is quenched at the<br>
next current zero.<br>
A further refinement of the follow on contact of figure 6 is<br>
illustrated in figure 8, the follow on contact 42 in figure 8<br>
likewise forming a conducting connection to the permanent<br>
magnet system 23 and, upon an opening limit angle between the<br>
moving contact 8 and the fixed contact 3 being exceeded during<br>
a disconnection operation, this electrical connection is<br>
disconnected and an arc burns between the follow on contact 42<br>
and the permanent magnet system 23 and is quenched at the next<br>
current zero. Illustrated by dashes is the moving contact 8 in<br>
the case of a closed contact<br><br>
system, and the solid illustration relates to an open contact<br>
system.<br>
Figure 9 shows a further embodiment of an inventive load<br>
interrupter in the case of which a permanent magnet system 4 4<br>
encloses the fixed contact 3 in the shape of a ring, the<br>
permanent magnet 44 being once again shielded at least on its<br>
sides facing the moving contact 8 or the movement path C of the<br>
moving contact 8 by means of a pan 45. In the case of this<br>
arrangement, as well, the magnetic field generated by the<br>
permanent magnet 44 acts on an arc in such a way that the<br>
latter is caused to rotate and is finally quenched at the next<br>
current zero.<br>
Illustrated in figure 10 is a further embodiment of an<br>
inventive load interrupter in the case of which a follow on<br>
contact 4 6 is arranged on the moving contact 8 via an<br>
articulation 47 and (not illustrated in the figure) spring<br>
elements and stop elements. Fastened on the follow on contact<br>
4 6 is a permanent magnet system 48 with a permanent magnet 4 9<br>
and a pan 50 for shielding the permanent magnet in the<br>
direction of the fixed contact 3. In this embodiment, when the<br>
moving contact 8 and fixed contact 3 are disconnected an arc is<br>
struck between the fixed contact 3 and the permanent magnet<br>
system 48 and, because of the magnetic field generated by the<br>
permanent magnet 4 9, likewise rotates along the surface of the<br>
pan 50 and is quenched at the next current zero. Illustrated by<br>
dashes is the follow on contact 46 with the permanent magnet<br>
system in the case of a closed contact system, while solid<br>
lines illustrate the case of an open contact system.<br>
Figures 2 and 4 to 10 illustrate arrangements of an inventive<br>
load interrupter by way of example, for<br><br>
the sake of simplicity in each case only one contact system<br>
composed of a fixed contact and a moving contact being<br>
illustrated.<br>
Figure 11 shows an exploded illustration of an inventive<br>
permanent magnet system 23 as arranged, for example, on the<br>
fixed contacts 17, 18 and 19 in figure 1. The fastening means<br>
33 has a fastening region 51 for holding the permanent magnet<br>
system 23 on the respective' fixed contact arrangement, and a<br>
support region 52. The fastening region 51 is formed in this<br>
case from two fastening lugs 53, 54 that have fastening<br>
openings 55 and 56, with the aid of which the fastening means<br>
33 is screwed on the respective fixed contact. Furthermore,<br>
there are provided on the fastening region 51 cutouts 57, 58<br>
that are provided for holding a lid part described further<br>
below. The support region 52 of the fastening means 33<br>
comprises a ring-shaped region 59 that is designed as an arc<br>
movement path 59. The arc movement path 59 is connected via<br>
lugs 60, 61 to the fastening region 51, there being formed in<br>
the lugs 60, 61 latching cutouts of which only one latching<br>
cutout 62 is to be seen in the figure. The permanent magnet 24<br>
is held in a covering made from a basic part 63 with a base 64<br>
and a hollow cylindrical wall 65 and a cover plate 66 such that<br>
the permanent magnet 24 is substantially fully covered by the<br>
covering, the covering composed of the basic part 63 and cover<br>
plate 66 being formed from iron such that a magnetic yoke for<br>
the permanent magnet system is formed by the covering. The<br>
cover plate 66 in this case has an outside diameter that is<br>
smaller than the inside diameter of the hollow cylindrical wall<br>
65 in such a way that there is formed in the gap remaining<br>
between the cover plate 66 and hollow cylindrical wall 65 a<br>
magnified radial magnetic field that provides maximum drive for<br>
a<br><br>
base of the arc on the arc movement path 59. A collar 67 and a<br>
cover part 68, both of which are formed from a plastics<br>
material, are provided as protective covering for the permanent<br>
magnet system 23. To this end, the cover plate 66, the<br>
permanent magnet 24 and the basic part 63 have central through<br>
openings 69, 70, 71 through which there extends a latching<br>
means 72 of the cover part 68, which latching means 72 engages<br>
in the cutouts 57, 58 of the fastening region 51 of the<br>
fastening means 33 and enables the entire arrangement to be<br>
held on the fastening means 33. By means of latching hooks 73,<br>
74, the collar 67 is likewise latched on the fastening means<br>
33, on the latching cutouts 62 thereof, such that a protective<br>
covering of the permanent magnet system is formed by means of<br>
the collar 67 and the cover part 68, the collar 67 having a<br>
front opening 75 with a radius that corresponds to the external<br>
radius of the arc movement path 59, and the cover part 68 has a<br>
radius that corresponds to the internal radius of the arc<br>
movement path 59 such that the collar 67 and the cover part 68<br>
cover the permanent magnet system 63 with the exception of the<br>
arc movement path 59.<br>
Figure 12 shows a perspective view from above of the assembled<br>
permanent magnet system on the fastening means 33,the latching<br>
means 72 of the cover part 68 being latched in the cutouts 57<br>
and 58, and the collar 61 being latched with the aid of its<br>
latching hooks 73 and 74 in the latching cutouts 62 of the lugs<br>
60, 61.<br>
Figure 13 shows a perspective view from below of the assembled<br>
permanent magnet system, the arc movement path 59 formed by the<br>
support region 52 being visible between the collar 67 and the<br>
cover part 68. To be seen in figure 13 is a cutout 76 of the<br>
collar 67 that is located in the mounted state<br><br>
in the region of the fixed contact arrangement, and which<br>
facilitates the transfer of an arc produced during a<br>
disconnection of the moving contacts 8, 9, 10 from the fixed<br>
contacts 17, 18, 19 to the arc movement path.<br><br>
