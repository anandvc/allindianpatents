				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
SURFACE-TREATED STEEL SHEET, METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME, AND<br>
RESIN-COATED STEEL SHEET<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to surface-treated steel sheets<br>
which are used principally for containers such as cans after being<br>
coated with resin in such a manner that resin films or the like<br>
are laminated on the surface-treated steel sheets or resin-<br>
containing paints are applied onto the surface-treated steel<br>
sheets. The present invention particularly relates to a surface-<br>
treated steel sheet having high adhesion (hereinafter referred to<br>
as wet resin adhesion) to resin applied thereto in a high-<br>
temperature humid environment, a method for producing the surface-<br>
treated steel sheet, and a resin-coated steel sheet produced by<br>
coating the surface-treated steel sheet with resin.<br>
The present invention further relates to a surface-treated<br>
steel sheet that exhibits high corrosion resistance even if resin<br>
applied thereto is peeled therefrom, a method for producing the<br>
surface-treated steel sheet, and a resin-coated steel sheet<br>
produced by coating the surface-treated steel sheet with resin.<br>
Background Art<br>
Tin-plated steel sheets and electrolytically chromated steel<br>
sheets referred to as tin-free steel sheets are used for various<br>
metal cans such as beverage cans, food cans, pail cans, and 18-<br>
litter cans. In particular, the tin-free steel sheets are produced<br>
by electrolyzing steel sheets in a plating bath containing<br>
hexavalent chromium and have the advantage of having excellent wet<br>
resin adhesion to resin such as paint.<br>
In recent years, the use of hexavalent chromium has tended to<br>
be restricted worldwide in response to growing environmental<br>
awareness. Alternatives to the tin-free steel sheets, which are<br>
produced using such a plating bath containing hexavalent chromium,<br>
have been needed. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2004-285380 discloses a steel sheet,<br>
electrolyzed in a tungstic acid solution, for containers. Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-220685<br>
discloses a surface-treated steel sheet, coated with a phosphonate<br>
layer, for containers. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2002-355921 discloses a steel sheet, coated with a<br>
surface treatment layer containing one or both of Sn and Ni, for<br>
containers, the surface treatment layer being overlaid with a<br>
resin layer which contains one or both of tannic acid and acetic<br>
acid and Ti, Zn, or one or more of compounds thereof and which has<br>
a phenol structure. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2006-009046 discloses a surface-treated metal<br>
material having an organic surface treatment layer and an<br>
inorganic surface treatment layer which contains no phosphate ion<br>
but principally contains T, 0, and/or F.<br>
Various types of metal cans have been conventionally<br>
manufactured in such a manner that metal sheets such as tin-free<br>
steel sheets are painted and then formed into can bodies. In<br>
recent years, the following method has been widely used to reduce<br>
the amount of industrial waste: a method in which a resin-coated<br>
metal sheet that is not painted but is coated with resin such as a<br>
resin film is formed into a can body. For the resin-coated metal<br>
sheet, the resin needs to strongly adhere to the metal sheet. In<br>
particular, resin-coated metal sheets used for beverage or food<br>
cans need to have high wet resin adhesion such that no resin is<br>
peeled therefrom even in high-temperature humid environments,<br>
because the beverage or food cans are subjected to retort<br>
sterilization steps in some cases after contents are packed in the<br>
beverage or food cans.<br>
Furthermore, the resin-coated metal sheets need to have high<br>
corrosion resistance such that the cans are prevented from being<br>
perforated by corrosion due to the contents of the cans even if<br>
resin is partly peeled from the cans by scratching.<br>
The following sheets and material have insufficient wet resin<br>
adhesion when being used in a retort atmosphere: the steel sheet<br>
electrolyzed in the tungstic acid solution as disclosed in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-285380,<br>
the surface-treated steel sheet coated with the phosphonate layer<br>
as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 2001-220685, the steel sheet having the resin layer having the<br>
phenol structure as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-355921, and the surface-treated<br>
metal material having the organic surface treatment layer and the<br>
inorganic surface treatment layer principally containing T, 0,<br>
and/or F as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2006-009046.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a surface-<br>
treated steel sheet which contains no Cr, which has excellent wet<br>
resin adhesion, and which can be used as an alternative to a tin-<br>
free steel sheet; a method for producing the surface-treated steel<br>
sheet; and a resin-coated steel sheet produced by coating the<br>
surface-treated steel sheet with resin.<br>

is disposed on at least one surface of the steel sheet and which<br>
contains Ti and at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn. The ratio of the total amount of Co,<br>
Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn to the amount of Ti contained therein is<br>
0.01 to ten on a mass basis.<br>
2. In the surface-treated steel sheet specified in Item 1, the<br>
adhesive layer has a thickness of 20 to 800 nm and also has bumps<br>

lower surface of the adhesive layer to the bumps in a cross-<br>
sectional profile of the layer observed with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM), and the line density of the bumps is<br>
defined as the number of the bumps per unit length. The number<br>
thereof is determined on the assumption that one of the bumps is<br>
present when one or more intersections of an upper-level<br>
horizontal line and a profile curve are present between two<br>
intersections of a lower-level horizontal line and the profile<br>
curve. The upper- and lower-level horizontal lines are ±10 nm<br>
apart from a center line located at a position given by the<br>

the lower surface of the adhesive layer to the bottom of a<br>
recessed portion.<br>

density of the bumps of the adhesive layer is defined as the<br>
number of the bumps that are 0.005 µm higher than an average line<br>

JIS B 0601: 2201 and determined in such a manner that a cross-<br>
sectional curve is derived from three-dimensional data obtained<br>
with a SEM and then filtered at a cut-off wavelength of 1.0 µm.<br>

cross-sectional profile of the layer observed with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM). The line density of the bumps is<br>
defined as the number of the bumps per unit length. The number<br>
thereof is determined on the assumption that one of the bumps is<br>
present when one or more intersections of an upper-level<br>
horizontal line and a profile curve are present between two<br>
intersections of a lower-level horizontal line and the profile<br>
curve. The upper- and lower-level horizontal lines are ±10 nm<br>
apart from a center line located at a position given by the<br>
formula (H + L) / 2, where L represents the minimum height from<br>
the lower surface of the adhesive layer to the bottom of a<br>
recessed portion.<br>

is disposed on at least one surface of the steel sheet, which has<br>
a thickness of 20 to 800 nm, which contains Ti, and which has<br>

average roughness (Ra) is 1.3 or less. The root-mean-square<br>
roughness and the arithmetic average roughness are specified in<br>
JIS B 0601: 2201 and determined in such a manner that a cross-<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The inventors have conducted intensive research on surface-<br>
treated steel sheets which contain no Cr, which have excellent wet<br>
resin adhesion, and which can be used as alternatives to tin-free<br>
steel sheets and have then obtained findings below.<br>
(1) Extremely excellent wet resin adhesion can be achieved by<br>
forming an adhesive layer containing Ti and an element such as Co,<br>
Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, or Zn on a steel sheet.<br>
(2) In order to achieve extremely excellent wet resin<br>
adhesion, an adhesive layer having a large number of fine bumps<br>
arranged uniformly is preferably formed.<br>
The present invention has been made on the basis of these<br>
findings. The contents of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
(1) Surface-treated steel sheet<br>
A surface-treated steel sheet according to the present<br>
invention includes an adhesive layer which is disposed on at least<br>
one surface of the surface-treated steel sheet and which contains<br>
Ti and at least one selected from the group consisting of Co, Fe,<br>
Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn.<br>
An ordinary steel sheet, such as a low-carbon steel sheet or<br>
an ultra-low-carbon steel sheet, for cans can be used as a raw<br>
steel sheet.<br>
A steel sheet coated with an adhesive layer containing Ti or<br>
an adhesive layer which contains Ti and at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn has<br>
excellent wet resin adhesion.<br>
The reason for this is unclear at present and is probably that<br>
a strong intermolecular force is present between resin and a layer<br>
which is composed of an oxide of Ti and which has high molecular<br>
weight or that the above metal element is taken in the layer<br>
containing Ti and therefore the layer has surface irregularities<br>
which are densely and uniformly distributed.<br>
The ratio of the total amount of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn<br>
to the amount of Ti in the adhesive layer needs to be 0.01 to ten<br>
on a mass basis. This allows the adhesive layer to have surface<br>
irregularities which are densely and uniformly distributed,<br>
thereby achieving excellent wet resin adhesion. The mass ratio<br>
thereof is preferably 0.1 to two. The content of the metal<br>
elements in the adhesive layer can be determined by energy-<br>
dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) or electron energy loss<br>
spectroscopy (EELS) in TEM observation below.<br>
In view of an increase in wet resin adhesion, the adhesive<br>
layer preferably further contains 0. The presence of 0 probably<br>
allows the adhesive layer to be composed of an oxide of Ti to<br>
generate a strong intermolecular force between the adhesive layer<br>
and resin.<br>
The amount of Ti in the adhesive layer is preferably 3 to 200<br>
mg/m2 per one surface. When the Ti amount is 3 mg/m2 or more and<br>
200 mg/m2 or less, the effect of improving wet resin adhesion is<br>
sufficiently obtained. When the Ti amount is greater than 200<br>
mg/m2, a further improvement of wet resin adhesion is not obtained<br>
and high cost arises. The amount of Ti in the adhesive layer can<br>
be determined by X-ray fluorescence surface analysis. The amount<br>
of 0 therein is not particularly limited and the presence of 0 can<br>
be confirmed by surface analysis using an XPS (X-ray photoelectron<br>
spectrometer).<br>
In order to achieve more excellent wet resin adhesion, the<br>
adhesive layer preferably has a thickness of 20 to 800 nm and also<br>
has bumps arranged with a line density of one or more per µm. When<br>
the thickness thereof is 20 nm or more, more excellent wet resin<br>
adhesion is achieved. When the thickness thereof is 800 nm or less,<br>
the adhesive layer is not fragile and has excellent wet resin<br>
adhesion.<br>
The reason why the presence of the bumps, arranged with a line<br>
density of one or more per µm, in the adhesive layer leads to an<br>
increase in wet resin adhesion is probably as described below.<br>
Figs. 1A and 1B each schematically show an adhesive layer, in<br>
cross section, included in a surface-treated steel sheet according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The adhesive<br>
layer has bumps which are uniformly and densely arranged. In<br>
particular, the bumps are arranged with a line density of one or<br>
more per µm; hence, the adhesive layer has an increased surface<br>
area and an increased contact area with resin as compared to<br>
layers, included in surface-treated steel sheets schematically<br>
shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, having nonuniform, sparse bumps. The<br>
presence of the bumps uniformly and densely arranged leads to an<br>
increase in an anchoring effect. Therefore, extremely excellent<br>
wet resin adhesion is achieved. When the line density of the bumps<br>
is less than one per µm, the contact area with resin is small and<br>
the anchoring effect is insufficient. Therefore, the above effect<br>
is not exhibited and the effect of increasing wet resin adhesion<br>
is small.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B show results obtained by observing thin-film<br>
samples with a TEM (transmission electron microscope), the thin-<br>
film samples being prepared by processing a cross-sectional<br>
surface of a surface-treated steel sheet of an example (No. 8 of<br>
an example below) and a cross-sectional surface of a surface-<br>
treated steel sheet of a comparative example (No. 1 of a<br>
comparative example below) by a focused ion beam (FIB) process.<br>
The sample shown in Fig. 3A has a layer having bumps which are<br>
more uniformly and densely arranged as compared to those shown in<br>
Fig. 3B.<br>
The thickness of an adhesive layer and the line density of<br>
bumps of the adhesive layer are defined on the basis of a cross-<br>
sectional profile of the adhesive layer, observed with a TEM,<br>
shown in Fig. 3A or 3B as described below. Any cross-sectional<br>
profile of the adhesive layer observed in an arbitrary in-plane<br>
direction of the adhesive layer can be used herein.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic view illustrating the thickness of an<br>
adhesive layer of a surface-treated steel sheet according to the<br>
present invention and the line density of bumps of the adhesive<br>
layer. The thickness of the adhesive layer is defined as the<br>
maximum height H from the lower surface of the adhesive layer to<br>
the bumps in a cross-sectional profile of the layer observed with<br>
a TEM. The line density of the bumps is defined as the number of<br>
the bumps per unit length, the number thereof being determined on<br>
the assumption that one of the bumps is present when one or more<br>
intersections of an upper-level horizontal line and a profile<br>
curve are present between two intersections of a lower-level<br>
horizontal line and the profile curve, the upper- and lower-level<br>
horizontal lines being +10 nm apart from a center line located at<br>
a position given by the formula (H + L) / 2, wherein L represents<br>
the minimum height from the lower surface of the adhesive layer to<br>
the bottom of one of recessed portions.<br>
The thickness of the adhesive layer may be determined in such<br>
a manner that the highest protruding portion is selected from the<br>
TEM cross-sectional profile of the layer and the height from the<br>
lower surface of the layer is measured. The minimum height L from<br>
the lower surface of the adhesive layer to the bottom of one of<br>
the recessed portions may be determined in such a manner that the<br>
deepest recessed portion is selected from the cross-sectional<br>
profile of the layer and the height from the lower surface of the<br>
layer to the bottom of the deepest recessed portion is measured.<br>
In the present invention, the distribution of bumps present in<br>
an adhesive layer can be defined as an area density of 16 or more<br>
per µm2 in such a manner that a surface image of the adhesive layer<br>
observed with a SEM is three-dimensionally analyzed. Figs. 5A and<br>
5B show a SEM image of an example (No. 8 of an example below) of<br>
the present invention and a SEM image of a comparative example (No.<br>
1 of a comparative example below), respectively. The example shown<br>
in Fig. 5A has a layer having bumps which are more uniformly and<br>
densely arranged as compared to those of the comparative example<br>
shown in Fig. 5B. The presence of the uniformly and densely<br>
arranged bumps leads to an increase in surface area, an increase<br>
in contact area with resin, and an increase in anchoring effect<br>
due to the recessed and bumps as described above; hence, extremely<br>
excellent wet resin adhesion is probably achieved.<br>
The area density of the bumps in the adhesive layer can be<br>
determined to be the number of the bumps that are 0.005 µm higher<br>
than an average line of the recessed and bumps that is determined<br>
in such a manner that the SEM image (a 6 µm x 4.5 µm region) shown<br>
in Fig. 5A or 5B is three-dimensionally analyzed and swells are<br>
eliminated by filtering at a cut-off wavelength of 1.0 µm.<br>
For the density of the bumps in the adhesive layer, the line<br>
density determined from the cross-sectional profile of the TEM<br>
cross-sectional profile of the layer and the area density<br>
determined by three-dimensionally analyzing the SEM surface image<br>
of the layer are separately specified above. The reason for this<br>
is that the former has a problem that it takes a long time to<br>
prepare or measure a sample although the adhesive layer can be<br>
directly observed and the latter is simple and speedy in<br>
measurement although it takes a long time to remove a resin layer<br>
when the resin layer is present on the layer. According to the<br>
present invention, it has been confirmed that the wet resin<br>
adhesion defined by the line density is equivalent to that defined<br>
by the area density.<br>
The ratio (Rq / Ra) of Rq to Ra is preferably 1.3 or less<br>
because the distribution of the bumps is uniform and dense, Rq and<br>
Ra being specified in JIS B 0601: 2201 and being determined in<br>
such a manner that a cross-sectional curve is derived from three-<br>
dimensional data obtained with a SEM and then filtered at a cut-<br>
off wavelength of 1.0 urn. Furthermore, Rsk or Rku is preferably<br>
0.6 or less or four or less, respectively, because the adhesive<br>
layer has a large surface area when being coated with resin,<br>
endures a pressure for forming a rigid interface, and exhibits an<br>
anchoring effect, Rsk and Rku being specified in JIS B 0601: 2201<br>
and being determined in such a manner that a cross-sectional curve<br>
is derived from three-dimensional data obtained with a SEM and<br>
then filtered at a cut-off wavelength of 1.0 (am.<br>
A process for forming the adhesive layer is preferably as<br>
follows: a steel sheet coated with a corrosion-resistant layer is<br>
cathodically electrolyzed or immersed in an aqueous solution<br>
containing Ti and ions of at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn. Preferred examples of<br>
an aqueous solution containing Ti include aqueous solutions<br>
containing fluorotitanate ions and aqueous solutions containing<br>
fluorotitanate ions and fluorides. Examples of compounds producing<br>
fluorotitanate ions include fluorotitanic acid, ammonium<br>
fluorotitanate, and potassium fluorotitanate. Examples of the<br>
fluorides include sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, silver<br>
fluoride, and tin fluoride. In particular, the steel sheet coated<br>
with the corrosion-resistant layer is preferably cathodically<br>
electrolyzed in an aqueous solution containing potassium<br>
fluorotitanate or an aqueous solution containing potassium<br>
fluorotitanate and sodium fluoride, because the adhesive layer can<br>
be uniformly formed with high efficiency.<br>
Examples of compounds producing ions of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn,<br>
or Zn include cobalt sulfate, cobalt chloride, iron sulfate, iron<br>
chloride, nickel sulfate, copper sulfate, vanadium oxysulfate,<br>
zinc sulfate, and manganese sulfate.<br>
The mass ratio of the metal ions to the Ti ions in the aqueous<br>
solution may be adjusted such that the mass ratio of the metal<br>
elements to Ti in the adhesive layer is 0.01 to ten. The current<br>
density and electrolysis time of cathodic electrolysis or the time<br>
of immersion may be appropriately determined depending on the<br>
necessary amount of Ti. The content of the metal elements in the<br>
layer can be measured by energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) or<br>
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in TEM observation as<br>
described above.<br>
The corrosion-resistant layer includes at least one selected<br>
from the group consisting of a Ni layer, a Sn layer, a Fe-Ni alloy<br>
layer, a Fe-Sn alloy layer, and a Fe-Ni-Sn alloy layer. After the<br>
corrosion-resistant layer is formed on at least one surface of the<br>
steel sheet, the adhesive layer is formed on the corrosion-<br>
resistant layer. This allows the surface-treated steel sheet to<br>
have increased corrosion resistance.<br>
The corrosion-resistant layer, which is disposed on the steel<br>
sheet, needs to include the Ni layer, the Sn layer, the Fe-Ni<br>
alloy layer, the Fe-Sn alloy layer, the Fe-Ni-Sn alloy layer, or<br>
some of these layers so as to be tightly bonded to the steel sheet<br>
and so as to allow the steel sheet to have excellent corrosion<br>
resistance even if resin is partly peeled from the steel sheet by<br>
scratching or the like.<br>
The corrosion-resistant layer can be formed by a known process<br>
depending on a metal element contained therein.<br>
(2) Resin-coated steel sheet (laminated steel sheet)<br>
A resin-coated steel sheet can be produced by coating the<br>
surface-treated steel sheet according to the present invention<br>
with resin. The surface-treated steel sheet according to the<br>
present invention has excellent wet resin adhesion as described<br>
above; hence, the resin-coated steel sheet has excellent corrosion<br>
resistance and work-ability.<br>
The resin used to coat the surface-treated steel sheet<br>
according to the present invention is not particularly limited and<br>
may be a resin film for lamination or a resin paint for painting.<br>
Examples of the resin include various thermoplastic resins and<br>
thermosetting resins. Examples of the resin film for lamination<br>
include olefin resin films made of polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
ethylene-propylene copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers,<br>
ethylene-acrylic ester copolymers, ionomers, or the like;<br>
polyester films made of polybutylene terephthalate or the like;<br>
polyamide films made of nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 11, nylon 12, or<br>
the like; and thermoplastic resin films such as polyvinyl chloride<br>
films and polyvinylidene chloride films. These films may be<br>
unstretched or biaxially stretched. Preferred examples of an<br>
adhesive used for lamination (laminate) include urethane adhesives,<br>
epoxy adhesives, acid-modified olefin resin adhesives, copolyamide<br>
adhesives, and copolyester adhesives (a thickness of 0.1 to 5.0<br>
µm) . A thermosetting lacquer may be applied onto the surface-<br>
treated steel sheet or the film so as to form a layer with a<br>
thickness of 0.05 to 2 (am.<br>
Examples of the lacquering include thermoplastic and<br>
thermosetting paints such as modified epoxy paints including<br>
phenol epoxy paints and amino-epoxy paints; vinyl chloride-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers; saponified vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymers; vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride<br>
copolymers; vinyl paints; modified vinyl paints including epoxy-<br>
modified vinyl paints, epoxy amino-modified vinyl paints, and<br>
epoxy phenol-modified vinyl paints; acrylic paints; and synthetic<br>
rubber paints including styrene-butadiene copolymers. These<br>
lacquers may be used alone or in combination.<br>
In the present invention, a resin layer preferably has a<br>
thickness of 3 to 50 µm and more preferably 5 to 40 µm. When the<br>
thickness thereof is less than the above range, the corrosion<br>
resistance thereof is insufficient. When the thickness thereof is<br>
greater than the above range, a work-ability problem is likely to<br>
occur.<br>
In the present invention, the resin layer can be formed on or<br>
above the surface-treated steel sheet by an arbitrary process.<br>
When the surface-treated steel sheet is coated with resin by<br>
lamination, the following process can be used: for example, an<br>
extrusion-coating process, a cast film heat-bonding process, or a<br>
biaxially stretched film heat-bonding process. For the extrusion-<br>
coating process, the surface-treated steel sheet may be extrusion-<br>
coated with molten resin, which is then heat-bonded thereto. That<br>
is, resin is melted and kneaded in an extruder and then extruded<br>
into a thin film from a T-die, the extruded molten thin film is<br>
fed between a pair of lamination rollers together with the<br>
surface-treated steel sheet, and the thin film and the surface-<br>
treated steel sheet are pressed against each other under cooling<br>
conditions so as to be unified and are then quenched. In the case<br>
where a multilayer resin coating is formed by extrusion coating, a<br>
plurality of extruders for sub-layers are used and flows of resins<br>
are discharged from the extruders, are joined in a multilayer die,<br>
and may then be subjected to extrusion coating in the same manner<br>
as that used for a single-layer resin. Alternatively, the surface-<br>
treated steel sheet is fed perpendicularly to a pair of lamination<br>
rollers and a molten resin web is supplied to both sides thereof,<br>
whereby resin coating layers can be formed on both surfaces of the<br>
surface-treated steel sheet.<br>
The resin-coated steel sheet produced as described above can<br>
be used for three-piece cans with side seams and seamless cans<br>
(two-piece cans). The resin-coated steel sheet can be used for<br>
lids of stay-on-tab type easy-open cans and lids of full open type<br>
easy-open cans.<br>
Described above are merely examples of embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Various modifications may be made within the<br>
scopes of the claims.<br>
(3) Method for producing surface-treated steel sheet<br>
A producing method according to the present invention is as<br>
described below: a corrosion-resistant layer including at least<br>
one selected from the group consisting of a Ni layer, a Sn layer,<br>
a Fe-Ni alloy layer, a Fe-Sn alloy layer, and a Fe-Ni-Sn alloy<br>
layer is formed on at least one side of a steel sheet and an<br>
adhesive layer is formed on the corrosion-resistant layer in such<br>
a manner that the steel sheet is cathodically electrolyzed in an<br>
aqueous solution containing ions of Ti and ions of at least one<br>
selected from the group consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and<br>
Zn.<br>
The adhesive layer can be formed in such a manner that the<br>
steel sheet is cathodically electrolyzed in the aqueous solution,<br>
which contains the Ti ions and the ions of at least one selected<br>
from the group consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn. The<br>
content of Ti in the aqueous solution is preferably 0.008 to 0.07<br>
mol/1 and more preferably 0.02 to 0.05 mol/1. The molar ratio of<br>
at least one selected from the group consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V,<br>
Cu, Mn, and Zn to Ti in the aqueous solution is preferably 0.01 to<br>
10 and more preferably 0.1 to 2.5, because the adhesive layer can<br>
be formed so as to have surface irregularities densely and<br>
uniformly distributed and excellent wet resin adhesion is achieved.<br>
Preferred examples of an aqueous solution containing Ti<br>
include aqueous solutions containing fluorotitanate ions and<br>
aqueous solutions containing fluorotitanate ions and fluorides.<br>
Examples of compounds producing the fluorotitanate ions include<br>
fluorotitanic acid, ammonium fluorotitanate, and potassium<br>
fluorotitanate. Examples of the fluorides include sodium fluoride,<br>
potassium fluoride, silver fluoride, and tin fluoride. In<br>
particular, the steel sheet coated with the corrosion-resistant<br>
layer is preferably cathodically electrolyzed in an aqueous<br>
solution containing potassium fluorotitanate or an aqueous<br>
solution containing potassium fluorotitanate and sodium fluoride,<br>
because the layer can be uniformly formed with high efficiency.<br>
Examples of compounds producing ions of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn,<br>
or Zn include cobalt sulfate, cobalt chloride, iron sulfate, iron<br>
chloride, nickel sulfate, copper sulfate, vanadium oxysulfate,<br>
zinc sulfate, and manganese sulfate.<br>
In order to allow the content of Ti in the aqueous solution to<br>
be 0.008 to 0.07 mol/1 and preferably 0.02 to 0.05 mol/1 and in<br>
order to allow the molar ratio of at least one selected from the<br>
group consisting of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn to Ti to be 0.01<br>
to 10 and preferably 0.1 to 2.5, the mass ratio of Ti to at least<br>
one of these metals in the aqueous solution may be adjusted. In<br>
cathodic electrolysis, the current density and the electrolysis<br>
time are preferably 5 to 20 A/dm2 and 2 to 10 sec, respectively.<br>
Examples<br>
Corrosion-resistant layers are formed on both surfaces of each<br>
cold-rolled low-carbon steel sheet (a thickness of 0.2 mm) used to<br>
produce a tin-free steel sheet by one of Processes A to D below in<br>
Plating Bath a or b shown in Fig. 1 (Nos. 30 and 31 are excluded).<br>
A: A cold-rolled steel sheet is annealed at about 700°C, temper-<br>
rolled at an elongation rate of 1.5%, degreased by alkali<br>
electrolysis, pickled with sulfuric acid, and then plated with Ni<br>
in Plating Bath a, whereby corrosion-resistant layers including Ni<br>
layers are formed.<br>
B: A cold-rolled steel sheet is degreased by alkali electrolysis,<br>
plated with Ni in Plating Bath a, annealed at about 700°C in an<br>
atmosphere containing ten volume percent H2 and 90 volume percent<br>
N2 such that Ni platings diffuse to permeate the steel sheet, and<br>
then temper-rolled at an elongation rate of 1.5%, whereby<br>
corrosion-resistant layers including Fe-Ni alloy layers are formed.<br>
C: A cold-rolled steel sheet is degreased by alkali electrolysis,<br>
plated with Ni in Plating Bath a, annealed at about 700°C in an<br>
atmosphere containing ten volume percent H2 and 90 volume percent<br>
N2 such that Ni platings diffuse to permeate the steel sheet,<br>
temper-rolled at an elongation rate of 1.5%, degreased, pickled,<br>
plated with Sn in Plating Bath b, and then subjected to heat<br>
melting by heating the steel sheet to a temperature higher than<br>
the melting point of tin. This process allows corrosion-resistant<br>
layers including Fe-Ni-Sn alloy layers and Sn layers disposed<br>
thereon to be formed.<br>
D: A cold-rolled steel sheet is degreased by alkali electrolysis,<br>
annealed under the same conditions as Conditions A, temper-rolled<br>
under the same conditions as Conditions A, plated with Sn in<br>
Plating Bath b, and then subjected to heat melting by heating the<br>
steel sheet to a temperature higher than the melting point of tin.<br>
This process allows corrosion-resistant layers including Fe-Sn<br>
alloy layers and Sn layers disposed thereon to be formed.<br>
In Processes C and D, the Sn platings are partly alloyed. The<br>
net amount of Sn remaining without being alloyed is shown in<br>
Tables 3 and 4 together with the amount of Ni and the amount of Sn<br>
in each corrosion-resistant layer.<br>
The corrosion-resistant layers formed on both surfaces of each<br>
steel sheet are cathodically electrolyzed under conditions shown<br>
in Tables 2 to 4 and then dried such that adhesive layers are<br>
formed on the corrosion-resistant layers, whereby Surface-treated<br>
Steel Sheet Nos. 1 to 31 shown in Tables 2 to 4 are prepared. The<br>
adhesive layers of Surface-treated Steel Sheet Nos. 1, 16, 19, 22,<br>
and 29 contain none of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn and therefore<br>
these sheets are comparative examples.<br>
The amount of Ti in each adhesive layers is determined by X-<br>
ray fluorescence spectrometry in comparison with a calibration<br>
sheet in which the amount of each deposited metal is determined by<br>
chemical analysis in advance. The amount of deposited Co, Fe, Ni,<br>
V, Cu, Mn, and Zn is determined by a technique selected from the<br>
group consisting of the same X-ray fluorescence spectrometry as<br>
that used to determine the amount of Ti, chemical analysis, Auger<br>
electron spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The<br>
mass ratio of Co, Fe, Ni, V, Cu, Mn, and Zn to that of Ti in the<br>
adhesive layer is then evaluated. The presence of O in each of<br>
Surface-treated Steel Sheet Nos. 1 to 31 can be confirmed by XPS<br>
surface analysis.<br>
For some of the surface-treated steel sheets, the thickness of<br>
each adhesive layer and the line density of bumps are measured in<br>
such a manner that a thin film sample is prepared by processing a<br>
cross-sectional surface of the layer using an FIB and a cross-<br>
sectional profile of the sample is observed with a TEM. In this<br>
operation, an evaluation region of the sample is determined by SEM<br>
observation in advance, a protective layer is formed thereon, and<br>
the thin film sample is prepared by processing the cross-sectional<br>
surface using the FIB and Ga ions so as to have a thickness of<br>
about 0.1 µm and is then observed with the TEM. In the present<br>
invention, the FIB is obtained with SMI-3050 MS2 manufactured by<br>
SII-NT and the TEM is JEM-2010F manufactured by JOEL Ltd.<br>
A SEM image is obtained with a SEM that can measure the shape<br>
of irregularities. In the present invention, a high-resolution SEM,<br>
ERA-8800FE, manufactured by Elionix Inc. is used. This instrument<br>
includes four secondary electron detectors and can display an<br>
image in which a difference in composition is emphasized or an<br>
image which shows irregularities viewed in a specific direction<br>
from sum signals and/or difference signals of secondary electrons.<br>
The adhesive layers of some of the surface-treated steel sheets<br>
are calculated for Rq, Ra, Rsk, and Rku on the basis of obtained<br>
SEM images using an image-processing program attached to this<br>
instrument. The area density of bumps is calculated in such a<br>
manner that the SEM image obtained with the SEM is analyzed using<br>
a three-dimensional surface analyzing program, "SUMMIT", developed<br>
by Yanagi laboratory in Nagaoka University of Technology. Au is<br>
vapor-deposited on each sample to a thickness of about 10 nm in<br>
advance of observation. The resulting sample is observed with the<br>
SEM at a magnification of 20000 times and an acceleration voltage<br>
of 5 kV. The sample is analyzed in arbitrary five fields of view<br>
and the obtained data is averaged, whereby the area density of the<br>
bumps and the like are determined. For the calculation of Rq, Ra,<br>
Rsk, and Rku, 100 or more cross-sectional curves are taken in each<br>
field of view and evaluation values are obtained by averaging<br>
values determined by evaluating roughness curves extracted' from<br>
the cross-sectional curves and then averaged in five fields of<br>
view.<br>
Films which are made of polyethylene terephthalate<br>
copolymerized with isophthalic acid and which have the following<br>
properties are prepared: a draw ratio of 3.1 x 3.1, a thickness of<br>
25 µm, a copolymerization ratio of 12 mole percent, and a melting<br>
point of 224°C. The films are laminated on both surfaces of each<br>
of Surface-treated Steel Sheet Nos. 1 to 31 such that the degree<br>
of biaxial orientation (BO value) of the films is 150 under the<br>
following lamination conditions: a steel sheet feed rate of 40<br>
m/min, a nip length of 17 mm, and a time lag between pressing and<br>
water cooling of one second. This allows Laminated Steel Sheet Nos.<br>
1 to 31 to be prepared. The term "nip length" means the length of<br>
a contact portion of a rubber roller with each steel sheet in the<br>
feed direction of the steel sheet. Laminated Steel Sheet Nos. 1 to<br>
31 are evaluated for wet resin adhesion as described below.<br>
Wet resin adhesion: Humid resin adhesion is evaluated by a 180°<br>
peeling test in a retort atmosphere having a temperature of 130°C<br>
and a relative humidity of 100%. The 180° peeling test is a film-<br>
stripping test in which a test piece (a size of 30 mm x 100 mm,<br>
the front and rear surfaces being each n = 1, each laminated steel<br>
sheet being n = 2) that includes a steel sheet 1 having a notched<br>
portion 3 and a film 2 attached thereto as shown in Fig. 6A is<br>
used, a weight 4 (100 g) is attached to an end of the test piece,<br>
and the test piece is folded 180° over the film 2 as shown in Fig.<br>
6B and then left for 30 minutes. A strip length 5 shown in Fig. 6C<br>
is measured and then evaluated. The strip lengths (n = 2) of the<br>
front and rear surfaces of each laminated steel sheet are averaged.<br>
The smaller the strip length 5, the better the wet resin adhesion.<br>
When the strip length 5 is less than 10 mm, the test piece is<br>
evaluated to be excellent in wet resin adhesion as targeted in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The evaluation results are shown in Tables 5 and 6. Laminated<br>
Steel Sheet Nos. 2 to 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 23 to 28, which are<br>
examples of the present invention, have excellent wet resin<br>
adhesion. In contrast, Laminated Steel Sheet Nos. 1, 16, 19, 22,<br>
and 29, which are comparative examples, have poor wet resin<br>
adhesion.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, a surface-treated<br>
steel sheet which contains no Cr and which is excellent in<br>
wet resin adhesion can be produced. The surface-treated<br>
steel sheet according to the present invention can be used<br>
as an alternative to a conventional tin-free steel sheet<br>
with no problem and can be used for containers for storing<br>
oils, organic solvents, or paints without being coated with<br>
resin. If a resin-coated steel sheet produced by coating<br>
the surface-treated steel sheet with resin is formed into<br>
cans or can lids and the cans or can lids are exposed to a<br>
retort atmosphere, no resin is peeled off.<br>
