				<td>The     present     invention     relates     to     (co)polymers     obtained     by (co)polymerization.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD A   subject-matter    of   the   present   invention    is   a,p,p-trisubstituted<br>
hydroxylamines, hereafter denoted by alkoxyamines, obtained in particular from p-phosphorated nitroxides, which can be used as initiators for radical polymerizations.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
FR 2 789 991 Al discloses alkoxyamines resulting from p-phosphorated nitroxides, such as N-(tert-butyl)-N-(l-diethoxyphosphoryl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)-0-(l-methyl-l-(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl)hydroxylamine, .which, used as initiators for polymerizations or copolymerizations of at least one monomer which can be polymerized by the radical route, provide excellent control of the polydispersity while ensuring a good rate of polymerization or of copolymerization.<br>
However, the Applicant Company has found that there were some disadvantages to the use of the said alkoxyamines in the polymerization or the copolymerization of certain monomers which can be polymerized by the radical route.<br>
Thus, it is difficult to achieve, high molar masses. In addition, risks• of runaway of the polymerization are observed with monomers having high propagation constants (kp), such as certain acrylates, when these initiators are used alone.<br>
Without the Applicant Company being committed to any one explanation,,it believes that, at the very start of the initiation of the polymerization of monomers having high kp values, in the presence of the said alkoxyamines, there is production of R' hydrocarbonaceous radicals which propagate very quickly to result in very high masses: This initial propagation reaction is very exothermic and runaway of the radical polymerization occurs. The persistent nitroxide radical &gt;NO*, formed from the homolytic cleavage of an alkoxyamine &gt;N—0—A according to the reaction scheme:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
with an excessively low kinetic dissociation constant kd with respect to kp, can no longer control the polymerization reaction as it is found to be in an insufficient concentration to control the growth of the chains and thus the evolution of heat.<br>
In order to overcome this disadvantage, some authors have added, at the beginning of polymerization, in addition to the alkoxyamine, a nitroxide (b; Benoit et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 121, pages 3904-3920,1999).'<br>
It is unsatisfactory to proceed in this way industrially as the alkoxyamine/nitroxide ratio has to be constantly adjusted to the type of monomer or mixture of monomers to be polymerized and to the polymerization temperature.<br>
Furthermore, it is very difficult, when using the said alkoxyamines, to control the polymerization of alkyl methacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate (MM'A), or the copolymerization of mixtures of monomers comprising high proportions of alky! methacrylates.<br>
ACCOUNT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Applicant Company has now found that the use of certain alkoxyamines derived in particular from p-phosphorated nitroxides as intiators for polymerizations or copolymerizations of at least one monomer which can be polymerized by the radical route makes it possible to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
A subject-matter of the invention is thus the use of alkoxyamines1 of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 3, R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a residue:<br>
in which R3 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 20, and R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched<br>
..-!•<br>
alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 8, a phenyl radical, an<br>
alkali metal, such as Li, Na or K, H^N", Bu4N+ or BusHN*, exhibiting a kinetic<br>
dissociation constant kd, measured at 120°C by EPR, of greater than 0.05 s"1 arid<br>
preferably of greater than 0.1 s"1.	<br>
It is preferable, among the alkoxyamines of formula (I), to use very particularly those in which R= CH3-, R1 = H and R2 =-H, CH3-,,(CH3)3C-, Li and Na..<br>
The alkoxyamines of formula (I) in which R1 = Hand R2 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 6 are known.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is thus the alkoxyamines-of formula (I), with the exception of the alkoxyamines of formula (I) in which R1 - H and R2<br>
	.<br>
represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging<br>
f rom 1 to 6.	        .<br>
The alkoxyamines of formula (I) can be prepared according tb.methods known in --the literature. The commonest method involves the coupling of .a carbonaceous radical with a nitroxide radical.<br>
Use will preferably be made, among all these methods,-for the preparation^<br>
the compounds of formula (I), of the method involving the ATRA (Atom Transfer<br>
Radical Addition) reaction, as disclosed in FR 2 791 979 Al incorporated in the<br>
present document by reference.	<br>
This method consists in reacting a nitroxide of formula:<br>

-	l,5,9-trimethyl-l,5,9-triazacyclododecane,<br>
-	l,4,8,ll-tetramethyl-l,4,8,ll-tetraazacyclotetradecane,<br>
by mixing a metal salt MA, the ligand L, the halogenated derivative (III) and the nitroxide (II) according to a molar ratio (III)/(II) ranging from 1 to 1.4 with' stirring in the organic solvent and by keeping the reaction medium stirred at a temperature of between 20°C and 40°C until the nitroxide (II) has completely disappeared, by then recovering the organic phase, which is washed with water, and by then isolating the alkoxyamine (I) by evaporation of the organic solvent under reduced pressure.<br>
Use will preferably be made, as organic solvents, of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, alkyl chlorides, and in particular CH2CI, and/or ethers.<br>
The metal salt used is preferably CuBr.<br>
It is also possible to introduce CuBr (in which the copper is in the 1 oxidation stage) and copper into the reaction medium.<br>
The alkali metal salts of the alkoxyamines (I) (R2 = Li, Na, i

or as a mixture of at least two abovementioned monomers.<br>
The alkoxyamines (I) can be introduced into the. polymerization ,or<br>
copolymerization medium at contents generally ranging from 0.005% to 40% by<br>
weight with respect to the monomer(s) employed and, preferably, at contents ranging<br>
from 0.01% to 10%.	<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is therefore the functional<br>
(cp)polymers obtained by.a (co)polymerization process using the.^koxyamines of<br>
formula (I) as initiators. .	<br>
There are numerous advantages to the use of the alkoxyamines (£) of the<br>
invention.	x .<br>
They make it possible to obtain high molar masses with good control .and a low<br>
polydispersity index. No runaway of the polymerization is observed, in particular in<br>
the cas
absence of free nitroxide. They'make possible (partial) control of the. polymerization<br>
of al.kyl methacrylates, such as MMA, in particular in the case of a mixture of<br>
monomers comprising at least 85% of alkyl methacrylate. .	,<br>
In the case where R2 is a hydrogen, an alkali metal-or a tert-butyl radical,<br>
they also make it possible to obtain functional (co)polymers exhibiting reactive<br>
functional'groups which make it possible to carry out chemical conversions;..such as<br>
grafting or coupling.	.	v&gt;<br>
These chemical conversion processes preferably involve esterification,<br>
transesterification, amidation, transamidation and epoxide opening reactions, fi would<br>
not be departing from the scope of the invention if an acid chloride were-used as<br>
intermediate in the esterification or amidation reactions. ,	<br>
Esterification processes can in particular be advantageously used for preparing polymeric polyalkoxyamines from polymeric monoalkoxyamiRes.according to the following scheme:<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
where A represents a polyvalent structure and P a sequence of monomers, such as styrene and substituted styrenes, dienes, acrylic monomers, such as acrylic acid or alkyl acrylates, methacrylic monomers, such as methacrylic acid .or' alkyl methacrylates, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, vinylpyrrolidinone or a mixture of at least two abovementioned monomers.<br>
.Esterification and amidation processes can also be advantageously used for condensing polymers which are not obtained by radical polymerisatioh'-such as polyesters, polyamides or polyepoxides. These reactions thus make possible access to<br>
7<br>
multiple block copolymer structures, such as polystyrene-polyester, pofystyrehe-polyamide, polystrene-polyepoxide, polyacrylate-polyester, polyacrylate-polyamide or polyacrylate- polyepoxide.<br>
• • The alkoxyamines of formula (I) of the preserit invention additionally exhibit the advantage of being stable solids which can be easily puriffed. Without the Applicant Company being committed to any one explanation, it is believed that this state results from the fact that, in the alkoxyamine of formula" (I), the carbon carrying, the R and R2 radicals is not asymmetric, in contrast to the epoxyamines mentioned in FR 2 789 991 Al.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention.	<br>

&gt;	Procedure:<br>
Cuprous bromide CuBr, copper Cu(0) and anhydrous benzene, are placed in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum. The solution is subsequently deoxygenated by sparging with nitrogen for 10 minutes. N,N,N',N',N"-Pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) is subsequently introduced under an inert atmosphere. Sparging with nitrogen is maintained for an additional 10 minutes.<br>
The a-brominated ester and the nitroxide SG1 are placed in anhydrous<br>
benzene in another round-bottomed flask. The solution is also degassed by sparging<br>
with nitrogen for 10 minutes. This solution is subsequently transferred into the first<br>
round-bottomed flask under an inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture, cooled using<br>
a water/ice mixture, is kept stirred magnetically for 15 min and then at ambient<br>
temperature for 45 min. The solution is subsequently filtered through celite and the<br>
precipitate is washed with ether. The filtrate is washed with ice-cold water until a<br>
colourless aqueous phase is obtained. The organic phase is dried over MgSC&gt;4 at 0°C<br>
and evaporated, to start with on a Rotavapor rotor evaporator and .then on. a<br>
0.08 mbar reduced pressure line.	.<br>
