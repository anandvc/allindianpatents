COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
The disclosure relates to a detergent. More particularly, the invention relates to a detergent composition including methyl ester sulphonate and a method of manufacturing the same.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Conventional dry mix detergent product formulations are based on synthetic soda ash. Dry detergent compositions are formed by mixing soda ash with one or more surfactants. In addition to soda ash arid surfactants, other additives such as builders, brighteners, soil release agents, perfumes etc are also added to detergents. However, since soda ash has to be manufactured, the cost of manufacturing soda ash adds to the cost of the detergent.<br>
There have been attempts to use methyl ester sulphonate as an active detergent. As methyl ester sulphonate is easily obtainable from renewable sources such as natural oil or fats and due to its biodegradable nature, it may be preferable over other surfactants conventionally used in detergent formulations. Furthermore, the use of certain commercial grades of methyl ester sulphonate as active detergent may result in a considerably low price detergent formulation.<br>
However, methyl ester sulphonate present in conventional detergent formulations hydrolyzes in the presence of moisture and high pH detergent components including builders such as carbonates, an<i bases such as sodium hydroxide. chemical instability of methyl ester sulphonate in an alkaline environment>9.0) results in poor detergency performance and reduced application flexibility. Moreover, as methyl ester sulphonate tends to form lumps it cannot be effectively niixed with the other detergent constituents and thus, addition of methyl ester sulphonate as such in the detergent deteriorates the free flowing nature of the detergent.<br>
In view of the above, there is a need to formulate a detergent composition enabling effective and maximum utilization of methyl ester sulphonate as an active detergent. Moreover, the detergent should be free flow and have good lather and foam generation property, improved detergency performance and should be cost effective.<br>

In accordance with an aspect, the detergent composition contains 25 to 40 weight % of crushed refined soda fines and preferably the detergent composition contains about 30 weight % of crushed refined soda fines.<br>
Crushed refined soda fines included in the detergent formulation may act as a bicarbonate source so as to control the pH of the detergent formulation at higher range (&gt; pH 9) and to stabilize methyl ester sulphonate, which is prone to degradation at higher pH. In the detergent formulation, generation of hydroxyl ions occurs due to dissolution of alkaline salts in water and these ions may affect the effectiveness of methyl ester sulphonate. The bicarbonate present in the detergent formulation provides a buffering effect. The bicarbonate ions react with hydroxyl ion<br>
8<br><br>
(generated from salt hydrolysis) to form carbonate ion and water (II). This allows methyl ester sulphonate to be effective even at higher pH levels.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Incorporation of methyl ester sulphonate in the manner as described above in the detergent formulation improoves the deter gency performance. The detergent formulation is also found to exhibit improved hard water cleaning performance, and thus allows the detergent to be used in a wider variety 0f cleaning applications. The hard water tolerance is also beneficial because hard water is used in any areas of the world for cleaning.<br>
The use of crusne refined soda fines provides a substitute for synthetic soda ash used in conventional detergent formulation. The use of micronized methyl ester sulphonate including a flow aid shows higher solubility in water, thereby exhibiting improved detergency performance compared to the conventional detergent formulations using methyl ester sulphonate.<br>
The dispersion of me micronized methyl ester sulphonate in the manufacture of the detergent along with the use of secondary surfactant generates the lather and foam required for improved cleaning performance. The present detergent formulation based on methyl ester sulphonate and crushed; refined soda fines are effective in both hard and soft water system. In addition, the dispersioh of methyl ester sulphonate helps in efficient mixing of micronized methyl ester sulphonate wim the other constituents of the detergent thereby leading to better cleaning performance compared to conventional detergents using methyl ester sulphonate.<br>
The use of crushed refined soda fines as a bicarbonate source also helps in preventing degradation of methyl ester sulphonate at higher pH, thereby maximizing the utilization of methyl ester sulphonate in the detergent. Moreover, the beneficiated crushed refined soda fines<br>
17<br><br>
used in the detergent formulation are also less expensive compared to synthetic soda ash used in conventional detergents.<br>
Previously, the effluent generated from the trona soda washery is disposed in nearby lands. An attempt has been made to address the problem of effluent disposal by the way of re-utilizing the wastes in the manufacture of consumer goods, such as detergents. In addition, as linear alkylbenzene sulphonic acid and methyl ester sulphonate used in the present composition are straight chain structures, they confer bio degradability i.e. environment friendliness to the detergent.<br>
Use of economical grade methyl ester sulphonate in detergent formulation contributes to the reduction in formulation cost and particle size distribution has been controlled to increase product uniformity. Special enzymes, added to the detergent, serve specific purposes like removal of blood and sweat stains. Thus, the detergent composition in accordance with an aspect is capable of providing a complete packaged product to the consumers of detergent powder for their daily requirement of fabric wash.<br>
