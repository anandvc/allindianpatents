The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present Invention relates to a thin film for an optical -information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has stable film" amorphous nature, is superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, has a high transmission factor, and is composed with a non-sulfide system* whereby the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer can be suppressed. The present invention also relates to; a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, ZnS-Si02 generally and primarily used as a protective layer of a phase change optical information recording medium has superior characteristics such as in optical characteristics, heat characteristics, and adhesiveness with the recording layer, and is being widely used.<br>
Nevertheless, rewritable DVDs in the present day as represented by Blu-ray discs are strongly demanded of more write cycles, greater capacity, and faster recording.<br>
As one reason for deterioration in the write cycles of an optical information recording medium, there is the diffusion of a sulfur constituent from the ZnS-Si02 to the recording layer material disposed in between the protective layers formed from<br>
ZnS-SiO2.<br>
Further, although pure Ag or Ag alloy having high thermal conduction properties with a high reflection ratio is being used as the reflective layer material for realizing high capacity and high-speed recording, this kind of reflective layer is also disposed to come in contact with the protective layer material of ZnS-Si02.<br>
2<br><br>
Therefore, in this case also, as a result of diffusion of the sulfur constituent from the ZnS-SiO2, the pure Ag or Ag alloy reflective layer material is subject to corrosive degradation, and would cause the characteristic degradation in the reflection ratio of the optical information recording medium.<br>
As a measure for preventing the diffusion of such sulfur constituent, attempts have-been made to provide an intermediate layer having nitrides or carbides as its primary component between the reflective layer and protective layer, and between the recording layer and protective layer. - Nevertheless, this results in an increased number of layers, and there is a problem in that that throughput will deteriorate and costs will increase.<br>
In order to overcome the foregoing problems, there is a pressing need to substitute the material with an oxide material that does not contain sulfides in the protective layer material, or discover a material having optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to or better than ZnS-Si02.<br>
In light of the above, an oxide protective layer material, a transparent conductive material and on optical *thin film have been proposed (refer to Patent Documents 1 to 3).<br>
-However, Patent Documents 1 to 3 have a problem in that they contain areas that are inferior in optical characteristics and amorphous nature.<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H01-317167 [Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2000-90745 [Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2003*166052<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has stable film amorphous nature, is superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, has a high transmission factor, and is composed with a non-sulfide system, whereby the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer can be suppressed. The present invention also provides a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein. As a result, the present invention is able to improve the rewriting characteristics of<br>
3<br><br>
the optical information recording medium.<br>
In order to overcome the foregoing problems, as a result of intense study, the present inventors discovered that, by substituting the conventional protective layer material ZnS-SiO2 with an oxide material presented below that does not contain sulfides, it is possible to ensure optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to or better than ZnS-SiO2 while improving the rewriting characteristics of the optical information recording medium.<br>
Based on the foregoing discovery, the present invention provides 1) a sputtering target comprised of Y2O3, Al2O3 and SiO2; 2) a sputtering target comprised of 10 to 60mbl% of Y2O3 10 to 40moi% of Al2O3, and 30 to"80mol% of Si02; and 3) the sputtering target according to 1) or 2) above, wherein the relative density is 95% or higher.<br>
The present invention further provides 4)An optical information recording medium and a manufacturing method thereof, wherein the optical information recording medium form a part of an optical information recording medium structure at least as a thin film by using the sputtering target according to any one of1) to 3) above; and 5)An optical information recording medium and a manufacturing method thereof, wherein the optical information recording medium forma part of an optical information recording medium structure at least as a thin film by using the sputtering target according to any one of 1) to 3) above, and is disposed adjacent to a recording layer or a reflective layer.<br>
As a result of the above, by substituting the protective layer material ZnS-SiO2 with an oxide material that does not contain sulfides, it is possible to suppress the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer caused by sulfur, and to provide a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has superior characteristics such as having optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to or better than ZnS-SiO2, being superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, and having a high transmission factor, as well as a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein.<br>
Further, by using this material, a superior effect is yielded in that it is possible to improve the rewriting characteristics of the optical information recording medium. In particular, since it is possible to improve the-transmission factor of shorter wavelengths, this material can be suitably used as a protective layer material for a<br><br>
blue laser phase*change recording medium.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention is comprised of a material having Y2O3, AI2O3 and Si02 as its primary components. SiO2 which is a glass-forming oxide stabilizes the amorphous material. In order to obtain this effect, it is desirable that the Si02 content is 30mol% or more. Nevertheless, if the SiO2 content exceeds 80m0l%, there is a problem in that the optical characteristics {refractive index) will become inferior, and it is desirable to make the. upper limit 80mol% in order to obtain favorable characteristics.<br>
The addition of AI2O3 has the effect of lowering the sintering temperature. By lowering the sintering temperature, it is possible to Increase the density-and realize stable manufacture. In order to achieve this effect, it is desirable to make the AI2O3 content 10mol% or more. Nevertheless, the addition of large amounts of AI2O3  will deteriorate the amorphous nature and cause the thermal conductivity to become too great, and, therefore, it is desirable to make the AI2O3 content 40mol% or less.   The remainder is Y2O3; that is, the Y2O3 content is 10 to 60mol%.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to make the relative density of the sputtering target to be 95% or higher, and manufacture a stable and high-density sputtering target.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention can be used to form a thin film, which is a part of an optical information recording medium structure. Further, the sputtering target of the present invention can be used to form a thin film, which is a part of an optical information recording medium structure, and is disposed adjacent to a recording layer or a reflective layer.<br>
This material has stable optical characteristics and amorphous nature of the film, and is suitable as a protective layer of a phase-change optical recording medium. .Radio frequency sputtering is used for the deposition.<br>
Since this material has stable amorphous nature and is able to improve the transmission factor as described above, it is suitable as a protective layer material for a phase change recording medium or a blue laser phase change recording medium with a fast rewriting speed.<br>
Further, the sputtering target of the present invention is able to achieve a relative density of 95% or higher.   The improvement in density yields an effect of<br>
5<br><br>
improving the uniformity of the sputtered film and inhibiting the generation of particles during sputtering.<br>
An optical information recording medium can be provided as a thin film in forming a part of an optical information recording medium structure by using the sputtering target described above.<br>
Further, ah optical information recording medium-that forms a part of the optical information recording medium structure as a thin film, and that is disposed adjacent to a-recording layer or a reflective layer by using the foregoing sputtering target can be formed.<br>
Moreover, the thin film formed- using the flittering target of the present invention forms a part of the optical information recording medium structure and is disposed adjacent to the recording layer or reflective layer, but as described above, since ZnS is not used, there is no contamination by S, there is no diffusion of the sulfur constituent to the recording layer material disposed between the protective layers; and there is a significant effect in that the deterioration of the recording layer can be prevented thereby.<br>
Further, when using pure Ag or Ag alloy having high ^thermal conduction properties at a high reflection ratio as adjacent reflective layers for realizing high capacity and high-speed recording, diffusion of the sulfur constituent to such adjacent reflective layers will not occur, and a superior effect is yielded in that the cause of the reflective layer material being subject to corrosive degradation and causing characteristic degradation in the reflection ratio of the optical information recording medium can be cleared out<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention can be manufactured-by subjecting the oxide powder of the respective constituent elements in which the average grain size is 5pm or less, to pressureless sintering or high temperature pressure sintering. It is thereby possible to obtain a sputtering target having a relative density of 95%.or higher.<br>
In such a case, it is desirable to calcinate the oxide powder having yttrium oxide as its primary component at a temperature of 1000 to 1400°C before sintering. After this calcinations, the resultant powder is pulverized to 3/im or less and used as the raw material for sintering.<br>
In the present invention, the addition of AI2O3 has a significant effect. As described above, by adding Al2O3, a superior effect is yielded in that it is possible to<br><br>
lower the sintering temperature.<br>
in a two component system of Y2O3-SiO2 although the optical characteristics and amorphous nature are favorable, in certain cases it is necessary to raise the temperature to 1700°C or higher in order to increase the density sufficiently, and there is a problem in that stable manufacture is difficult. The present invention is able to Slower the sintering temperature to 1600*C or lower, and a significant effect is obtained in that optical characteristics and amorphous nature could be satisfied with high density.<br>
Further, by using the sputtering target of the present invention, a significant effect is-yielded in that it is possible to-improve the productivity obtain-a high-quality material; and stably manufacture an optical recording medium having an optical disk protective film at low costs.<br>
Improvement in-the density of the sputtering target of the present invention reduces holes and miniaturizes crystal grains, and enables the sputtered face of the target to become uniform and smooth. As a result, a significant result is yielded in that particles and nodules generated-during sputtering can be reduced, the target life can be extended, and the mass productivity can be improved with minimal variation in the quality. Examples<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples of the present Invention are now explained. These Examples are merely illustrative, and the present invention shall in no way be limited thereby. In other words* the present invention shall only be, limited by the scope of the present invention, and shall include the. various modifications other than the Examples of this invention. (Examples 1 to 4)<br>
SiO2 powder,-Y2O3 powder and AI2O3 powder equivalent of 4N and 5μm or less were prepared; and these powders were mixed to achieve the composition shown in Table 1, subject to wet blending, dried, and thereafter calcinated at 1100°C. Further, after subjecting the calcinated powder to wet pulverization up to an average grain size equivalent to 1μm, a binder was added and this was granulated with a spray dryer. This granulated powder was subject to cold pressure forming, thereafter subject to pressureless sintering under oxygen atmosphere (flow) at 1200 to 1600°C, and this sintered material was formed into a target with machining process.<br><br>
The sintering temperature of Examples 1 to 4 was 1400°C, 1550°C, 1250°C, ^ and 140G°C1 respectively.   Incidentally, roughly the same sintering results were obtained with the sintering temperature within the foregoing temperature range.<br>

Amorphous nature was represented with the maximum peak strength against an undeposited glass substrate In a range of 2θ = 20-60°4n the XRD measurement of the deposition sample subject to anneal processing (600°C x 30min, Ar atmosphere). Further, o represents 1.0 to 1.5, ‚ represents, 1 ;5 to 2.0, -and x represents 2.0 or more.<br>
The foregoing 6-Inch Φ size target subject to finish processing -was used to perform sputtering. The sputtering conditions were RF sputtering, sputtering power of 1000W, and Ar gas pressure of 0.5Pa, and deposition was performed at a target film thickness of 1500Ǻ.<br>
Results of the measured transmission factor (wavelength 405nm)%, refractive index (wavelength 405n m), and amorphous nature (represented with the maximum peak strength against an undeposited glass substrate in a range of 26 = 20-60° in the XRD measurement-(Cu-Ka, 40kV, 30mA) of the deposition sample<br><br>
subject to anneal processing (600°C x 30min, Ar atmosphere)) are collectively shown in Table 1.<br>
As a result of the above, the sputtering target of Examples 1 to 4 achieved a relative density of 95% or higher, and stable RF sputtering could be performed.<br>
Further, the transmission factor of the sputtered film achieved 95 to 96% (405nm), the refractive index was 1.7 to 1.9; no specific crystal peak could be observed, and possessed a stable amorphous nature (1 ;0 to 1.5),<br>
Since the targets Of the Examples do not use ZnS, there is no characteristic degradation in the optical information recording medium caused by the diffusion or contamination of sulfur, further in comparison to the; Comparative example described later, the transmission factor, refractive index, and amorphous stability all showed favorable numerical values. (Comparative Examples 1 to 4)<br>
As shown in Table 1, materials having components and compositions of raw material powder that are different from the conditions of the present invention were prepared, and, particularly in Comparative Example 4, ZnS raw material powder was prepared, the sintering temperature was set to be 15006C to 1800*C, and targets were prepared with these materials under the same conditions as the Examples, and such targets were used to form a sputtered film. The sintering temperature for Comparative Examples 1 to 4 was 1650°C, 1550oC, 1750°C, and 1000°C (via hot pressing), respectively.<br>
The results are similarly shown in Table 1.<br>
With respect to the components and compositions of the Comparative Examples that deviate from the composition ratio of the present invention; for instance regarding Comparative Example 1, since it contained too much Al203 at 60mol%, the amorphous nature showed inferior results.<br>
With Comparative Example 2, since it contained insufficient amounts of Y203 and Al203, and contained too much Si02, it was out of balance and the refractive index deteriorated below standard.<br>
With Comparative Example. 3, since it contained too much Y203 and contained insufficient amounts of Si02, it was out of balance and sufficient density could not be achieved, and the sputtering characteristics showed inferior results.<br>
With Comparative Example 4, although the refractive index was high and the density was high, since it contained large amounts of ZnS, it was a material with a<br>
9<br><br>
risk of being contaminated by sulfur, and the transmission factor also showed inferior results.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Since the thin film formed by using a sputtering target of the present invention forms a part of the structure of the optical information recording medium and does not use ZnS, it yields a significant effect in that diffusion of the sulfur constituent to the recording layer material twill not occur, and deterioration of the recording layer can be prevented thereby further whom using pure Ag or Ag alloy having high thermal conduction properties at a high reflection ratio as adjacent reflective layers, diffusion of the^ sulfur constituent to such reflective-layers will not occur, and superior effect is yielded in that the cause of the reflective flayer being subject to corrosive degradation and causing characteristic degradation can be cleared out.<br>
Further, in addition to the amorphous nature becoming stabilized, the target will be provided with conductivity, sintering with a relatively low temperature will be enabled, and the targets can thereby be manufactured stably. -Moreover, since it is possible to make the relative density a high density of 95% or higher, stable RF sputtering is enabled. In addition, there is a significant effect in that he  controllability of sputtering can be facilitated, and the sputtering efficiency can also be improved. Further still, there is significant effect in that it is possible to reduce the particles (dust) or nodules arising during sputtering upon performing deposition, improve the mass productivity with little variation in quality, and stably manufacture an optical recording medium having an optical disk protective film at low costs.<br>
