				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the production of acetic acid by<br>
methanol carbonylation.<br>
The Related Art<br>
An important process for the production of acetic acid is the carbonylation of methanol<br>
with carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction medium. The reaction is generally carried out in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, e.g., a Group VIII metal catalyst such as rhodium, a halogen containing<br>
catalyst promoter, e.g., methyl iodide, and water. An ionic catalyst stabilizer/co-promoter such<br>
as lithium iodide may also be present. A disadvantage of this process is that, in addition to the<br>
desired acetic acid, various amounts of undesirable impurities are also produced, e.g.<br>
permanganate reducing compounds (PRC"s) including carbonyl compounds such as<br>
acetaldehyde, unsaturated aldehydes such as crotonaldehyde and 2-ethylcrotonaldehyde,<br>
saturated aldehydes other than acetaldehyde such as butyraldehyde and 2-ethylbutyraldehyde,<br>
and ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, all of which are involved in the<br>
determination of "permanganate time," an important commercial test which the acetic acid<br>
product must pass for many end uses. Other undesirable impurities produced in the methanol<br>
carbonylation process are propionic acid which reacts similarly to acetic acid in the production<br>
of products such as vinyl acetate but often has an adverse effect on the properties of such<br>
products, and when methyl iodide is used as a catalyst promoter, higher alkyl iodides, e.g., C2-<br>
C12 alkyl iodides such as ethyl iodide and hexyl iodide which are more difficult to remove from<br>
acetic acid by distillation than methyl iodide and which among other adverse effects, poison the<br>
catalysts generally used in the production of vinyl acetate from acetic acid.<br>
It is believed that, in addition to reducing the selectivity to acetic acid of the methanol<br>
carbonylation process, the acetaldehyde formed in the reaction is instrumental in the formation<br>
of several of the foregoing impurities by undergoing further reaction. Thus, acetaldehyde under<br>
typical reaction conditions may form various hydroxyaldehydes by aldol condensation and cross-<br>
aldol condensation, which are then dehydrated to form unsaturated aldehydes such as<br>
crotonaldehyde and 2-ethylcrotonaldehyde. Moreover, because of the presence of hydrogen in<br>
the reaction section due to the water gas shift reaction, some of the acetaldehyde may be reduced<br>
to ethanol, which is then carbonylated to propionic acid. Finally, when methyl iodide is present<br>
as a catalyst promoter and/or an ionic iodide such as lithium iodide is used as a catalyst<br>
stabilizer/co-promoter, such compound may react with acetaldehyde or a carbonyl compound<br>
synthesized from acetaldehyde to form one or more C2-C12 alkyl iodides which are more difficult<br>
to separate from acetic acid than is methyl iodide.<br>
In view of the reduction of selectivity to acetic acid caused by the formation of<br>
acetaldehyde and the adverse effects resulting from the presence in the acetic acid product of<br>
even small amounts of acetaldehyde and compounds formed from acetaldehyde both during the<br>
methanol carbonylation reaction, and the purification of the acetic acid product, a method for<br>
reducing the amount of acetaldehyde in any part of the reaction and/or purification sections of<br>
the system is desirable.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,769,329 discloses a process for the production of acetic acid by the<br>
carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst system comprising<br>
rhodium and a halogen component wherein the halogen is iodine or bromine.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 5,001,259; 5,026,908; and 5,144,068 disclose processes for the<br>
production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide in a liquid<br>
medium containing a rhodium catalyst stabilized with an iodide salt along with an alkyl iodide,<br>
an alkyl acetate and an unusually low concentration of water.<br>
Various methods for reducing impurity levels in acetic acid production processes have<br>
been disclosed. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,155,265, 5,155,266, and 5,202,481 disclose the purification<br>
of acetic acid made by low water carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide and<br>
containing iodide, unsaturates and carbonyl impurities, by treating the final product with ozone.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,625,095 discloses a process for the production of acetic acid by the<br>
carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a rhodium catalyst, iodide<br>
salts and methyl iodide wherein the acetaldehyde concentration in the reaction liquid is<br>
maintained at 400 ppm or lower by contacting the liquid containing the carbonyl impurities with<br>
water to separate and remove such impurities.<br>

and the other predominately organic.<br>

ends distillation column. Optionally, the overhead from the last column may be subjected to an<br>
aqueous extraction to recover residual methyl iodide for recycle before sending the extract<br>
containing acetaldehyde to waste treatment.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process and a system for producing acetic acid by the<br>
catalytic carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide to obtain a reaction product stream<br>
comprising acetic acid and a minor amount of acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde in the reaction<br>
product stream is partially converted by oxidation to acetic acid or further to CO2 and H2O. The<br>
stream may then be directed to the purification section, the reaction section, or both, thereby<br>
reducing the deleterious effects of acetaldehyde. In conventional systems, acetaldehyde is<br>
isolated for removal as a waste stream component. One of the advantages of the present<br>
invention over conventional processes is the elimination of at least one waste stream or reducing<br>
the quantity of waste produced. Additionally, the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid<br>
through the oxidation process increases the efficiency of the overall process.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the process of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTON<br>
Processes for the synthesis of acetic acid by the catalytic carbonylation of methanol with<br>
carbon monoxide are well known in the art as exemplified by the disclosures of the previously<br>
cited references. Methanol and CO are reacted in the presence of a catalyst system which may<br>
comprise, for example, a Group VIII metallic element, particularly Rh, Ir, Co, Ni, Ru, Pd or Pt,<br>
and most often Rh or Ir, a halogen promoter, most often a hydrogen halide or organic halide,<br>
particularly an alkyl iodide such as methyl iodide, a stabilizer/copromoter, which is a salt of a<br>
metal of Group IA or IIA of the Periodic Table, or a quaternary ammonium or phosphosium salt,<br>
particularly an iodide or acetate salt and most often lithium iodide, or lithium acetate. The active<br>
catalyst may be a complex of the Group VET metal, and in some cases may be added to the<br>
reaction section as a pre-formed complex rather than the described individual catalyst<br>
components. The catalyst system is dissolved or dispersed in a liquid medium comprising<br>
methyl acetate, acetic acid, a finite amount of water, e.g., at least about 0.1 wt.% and up to about<br>
15 wt.% or higher, and any other solvent component compatible with the other compounds<br>
present.<br>
A suitable catalyst system for the process includes rhodium as the Group VIII metal,<br>
methyl iodide as the halogen catalyst promoter, lithium iodide as catalyst stabilizer/copromoter,<br>
all dissolved or dispersed in a liquid medium comprising methyl acetate, acetic acid, and a<br>
relatively low amount of water in the range of about 0.1 wt.% to about 8 wt.% based on the total<br>
weight of reaction liquid.<br>
During a period of active reaction, methanol and CO are continuously fed to a reactor<br>
containing reaction liquid in which a desired partial pressure of CO is maintained. As<br>
mentioned previously and discussed hereinafter, the reaction liquid may contain small amounts<br>
of undesirable impurities in addition to the desired components identified previously, e.g.,<br>
acetaldehyde and other carbonyl containing PRC"s, and propionic acid.<br>
To prevent the accumulation of inert gases, a gaseous purge is withdrawn from the top of<br>
the reactor and treated to recover valuable condensables such as methyl iodide and methyl<br>
acetate. The remaining gases are sent to a flare. Reaction liquid is withdrawn from the reactor<br>
and fed to a flasher where a reduction in pressure results in the vaporization of the lighter<br>
components from the reaction mixture, the remainder of the reaction mixture comprising acetic<br>
acid and the Group VIII metal catalyst may be recycled to the reactor. The vapors from the<br>
flasher are fed to a light ends or splitter column from which a crude acetic acid product is<br>
withdrawn as a liquid side draw or base product (as described in U.S. Patent 5,144,068) and sent<br>
to further purification and the overhead vapors are condensed and separated into a light aqueous<br>
phase and a heavy organic phase. The light aqueous phase contains a preponderance of water, a<br>
lower but significant amount of acetic acid, and much smaller amounts of methanol, methyl<br>
iodide, and methyl acetate. Acetaldehyde and other PCR"s, which are by-products of the initial<br>
reaction or are formed subsequently from further reaction of acetaldehyde, are also present. The<br>
heavy organic phase contains predominately methyl iodide with some methyl acetate, a minor<br>
amount of water, and a typically smaller percentage of acetaldehyde, than the light aqueous<br>
phase. The heavy organic phase is either recycled directly to the reaction section or recycled<br>
aiter further processing, including optionally processing via oxidation.<br>
The light aqueous phase of the overhead condensate of the light ends column is typically<br>
used as reflux and a portion is recycled directly to the reaction section. As used herein, the<br>
phrase "reaction section" refers to the reactor and flasher components of the system collectively.<br>
In some processes, the light aqueous phase is first fed to an acetaldehyde removal system as<br>
disclosed, for example, in previously cited U.S. Patent No. 6,143,930 and U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,769,329. In one variation of an acetaldehyde removal system the light aqueous phase of the<br>
light ends column overhead condensate is fed to a first distillation column, termed an<br>
"acetaldehyde concentrator", which serves to separate most of the acetaldehyde, methyl iodide,<br>
and methyl acetate as overhead from a heavier fraction comprising acetic acid and water, which<br>
is recycled to the purification section. The latter overhead is then fed to a second distillation<br>
column, termed an "acetaldehyde stripper", which serves to separate most of the acetaldehyde in<br>
this stream, from a heavier fraction comprising methyl iodide and methyl acetate, which is<br>
recycled to the purification section. The latter overhead comprising an increased concentration<br>
of acetaldehyde and some heavier components such as methyl iodide is then subjected to an<br>
extraction with water to obtain an aqueous extract comprising most of the acetaldehyde and an<br>
organic raffinate comprising the less water-soluble components of the stream such as methyl<br>
iodide, which is recycled to the purification section. The aqueous acetaldehyde stream is<br>
disposed of as waste. As used herein, the phrase "purification section" refers to the distillation<br>
and separator/decanter components of the system collectively.<br>
The present invention provides a process in which the need to isolate and dispose of<br>
acetaldehyde as a waste stream is eliminated. However, it is understood that the present<br>
invention may be used in conjunction with a process including acetaldehyde isolation and<br>
removal as waste. In one embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of the acetaldehyde in<br>
the light aqueous phase of the overhead of the light ends column is oxidized to convert the<br>
acetaldehyde to acetic acid, or further to CO2 and H2O, before recycling to the purification<br>
section or forwarding to the reaction section. Alternatively, the oxidized portion of the light<br>
phase stream may be split and returned to both the reaction section and the purification section.<br>
Wherever it is stated herein that a stream is forwarded to the reaction section or the purification<br>
section, the path to the reaction section or purification section may not be direct but may be by<br>
way of an intermediate point such as for further purification or treatment before the significant<br>
components of the stream actually enter the reaction section. Such light aqueous phase may<br>
contain about 0.05 to about 5 wt.% of acetaldehyde, about 0.1 to about 5 wt.% of methyl iodide,<br>
about 0.1 to about 10 wt.% of methyl acetate, about 10 to about 45 wt.% of acetic acid, and the<br>
balance is water. Typically the light aqueous phase from the light ends column overhead<br>
contains about 0.5 to 2 wt.% of acetaldehyde, about 2 wt.% of methyl iodide, about 6 wt.% of<br>
methyl acetate, about 2 wt.% of methanol, about 20 wt.% of acetic acid, and the balance is water.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, depending on the configuration of the<br>
process equipment, streams or portions of streams other than the light aqueous phase may be<br>
oxidized to reduce acetaldehyde content. In other words, any post reaction stream, or a portion<br>
thereof, containing acetaldehyde may be oxidized to convert the acetaldehyde to acetic acid or<br>
further to CO2 and H2O. One reason for converting acetaldehyde in the light phase is to<br>
eliminate the need to isolate and dispose of the acetaldehyde as a waste product. Another reason<br>
is to convert unwanted acetaldehyde to the desired product, acetic acid. A third reason is to<br>
prevent the formation of other undesirable impurities from further reaction of acetaldehyde.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is to oxidize the aqueous extraction of<br>
acetaldehyde from the acetaldehyde stripper overhead stream before such extract is recycled to<br>
the reaction section. Such an extract, before oxidation, will contain from about 20 to about 25<br>
wt.% of acetaldehyde, from about 2 to about 5 wt.% of dimethyl ether, from about 65 to about<br>
75 wt.% of water, and from about 0.5 to about 1 wt.% of methyl iodide. In a typical process, the<br>
aqueous extract may contain about 25 wt.% of acetaldehyde, about 3 wt.% of dimethyl ether,<br>
about 70 wt.% of water, and about 1 wt.% of methyl iodide. The oxidized stream may then be<br>
recycled to the purification section or forwarded to the reaction section.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a stream, which may be subjected to the<br>
oxidation treatment, is the dry organic stream from the overhead of the acetaldehyde stripper.<br>
This stream may contain from about 45 to about 75 wt.% of acetaldehyde, from about 5 to about<br>
15 wt.% of dimethyl ether, and from about 20 to about 40 wt.% of methyl iodide. In a typical<br>
process, this stream is, for example, about 60 wt.% of acetaldehyde, about 10 wt.% of dimethyl<br>
ether, and about 30 wt.% of methyl iodide. The oxidized stream may then be recycled to the<br>
purification section or forwarded to the reaction section rather than subjected to an extraction<br>
treatment.<br>
In another embodiment, the overhead stream of the acetaldehyde concentrator is<br>
subjected to an oxidation treatment in accordance with the present invention. This stream may<br>
contain, for example, from about 5 to about 10 wt.% of acetaldehyde, from about 0.1 to about 40<br>
wt.% of methyl iodide, from about 45 to about 65 wt.% of methyl acetate, and about 2 to about 5<br>
wt.% of water, In a typical process, this stream may have a composition of about 8 wt.% of<br>
acetaldehyde, about 34 wt.% of methyl iodide, about 54 wt.% of methyl acetate, and about 4<br>
wt.% of water. The oxidized stream may then be recycled to the purification section or<br>
forwarded to the reaction section rather than being fed to the acetaldehyde stripper.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, and not shown in Figure 1,<br>
acetaldehyde can be extracted from the heavy phase recycle, 20, into a separate circulating<br>
aqueous phase. This separate aqueous phase is forwarded to the oxidation reactor, 15. The<br>
extractor, wherein these streams are contacted, serves a dual purpose. First, it allows the<br>
circulating aqueous phase to extract acetaldehyde from the heavy phase recycle, 20. Second, it<br>
allows oxidation reaction products to be extracted by the heavy phase recycle from the<br>
circulating aqueous stream and thus recycled to the carbonylation reactor, 3. It may also be<br>
desirable to purge the circulating aqueous phase to further minimize the accumulation of<br>
oxidation reaction products. Any aqueous recycle stream within the carbonylation process or<br>
water from and outside source, may serve as a source for such a purge.<br>
This alternative embodiment of the invention thus involves a process for the production<br>
of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol, in a system comprising a reaction section and a<br>
purification section, comprising the steps of: (a) producing a reaction section product stream<br>
comprising acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and water in a reaction section comprising a reactor and a<br>
flasher; (b) directing at least a portion of the reaction section product stream to a purification<br>
section comprising a light ends distillation column to separate the reaction section product<br>
stream into component streams comprising a heavy phase stream and a light phase stream<br>
wherein the heavy phase stream is comprised of acetic acid, acetaldehyde and water; (c)<br>
directing at least a portion of the heavy phase stream to an extractor means to extract<br>
acetaldehyde from the heavy phase stream and forming an aqueous phase stream comprising<br>
some acetaldehyde; (d) directing and circulating at least a portion of the aqueous phase stream<br>
to an oxidizing means to oxidize at least a portion of the aqueous phase stream and forming an<br>
oxidized effluent stream; (e) circulating at least a portion of the effluent stream between an<br>
extractor means and the oxidizing means; (f) withdrawing at least a portion of the oxidized<br>
aqueous phase stream from the extractor means and directing the withdrawn portion of the<br>
oxidized aqueous phase stream to a portion of the system selected from the group consisting of<br>
the reaction section, the purification section, and both the reaction section and the purification<br>
section.<br>
Another option is to directly oxidize the heavy phase recycle, 20. The heavy phase<br>
recycle, 20, may be forwarded to the oxidation reactor, 15, and the effluent directed to the<br>
carbonylation reactor, 3. However, oxidation reaction byproducts, such as iodine, may form and<br>
be operationally problematic.<br>
This alternate embodiment to directly oxidize the heavy phase involves a process for the<br>
production acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol, in a system comprising a reaction<br>
section and a purification section, comprising the steps of: (a) producing a reaction section<br>
product stream comprising acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and water in a reaction section comprising<br>
a reactor and a flasher; (b) directing at least a portion of the reaction section product stream to a<br>
purification section comprising a light ends distillation column to separate the reaction section<br>
product stream into component streams comprising a heavy phase stream and a light phase<br>
stream wherein the heavy phase stream is comprised of acetic acid, acetaldehyde and water; (c)<br>
directing at least a portion of the heavy phase stream to an oxidation means to oxidize at least a<br>
portion of the heavy phase stream; and (d) withdrawing at least a portion of the oxidized heavy<br>
phase stream from the oxidizing means and directing the withdrawn portion of the oxidized<br>
heavy phase stream to a portion of the system selected from the group consisting of the reaction<br>
section, the purification section, and both the reaction section and the purification section.<br>
The oxidation of the acetaldehyde in any stream to be treated in accordance with this<br>
invention may be accomplished with any oxidizing agent capable of converting acetaldehyde to<br>
acetic acid or further to CO2 and H2O.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents may be gaseous at normal temperature and pressure ("NTP").<br>
Examples of such oxidizing agents are air or pure oxygen. Alternatively oxygen diluted with air<br>
or an inert gas such as nitrogen or even air diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen is suitable.<br>
Other examples of suitable oxidizing agents, which are gaseous at NTP, are ozone or ozone<br>
diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
When a gaseous oxidant such as ozone, oxygen, or air is employed, the oxidation may be<br>
carried out by bubbling the oxidant through a volume of the stream being treated. The oxidation<br>
step may take place in the presence of oxidation catalysts which do not adversely react with any<br>
of its components.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents may also be liquid at NTP. Oxidation with liquid oxidants<br>
such as peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxide may be carried out by mixing the stream being<br>
treated with the oxidant in a stirred reaction section. The effective molar ratio of the oxidants to<br>
the acetaldehyde in the oxidation step is over a wide range. Generally, molar ratios of 0.5 to 10<br>
are suitable, with ratios of 0.5 to 4 being more likely for most equipment and oxidants.<br>
Whether the oxidant is a liquid or gas, the temperature and pressure of the oxidation is<br>
not critical as long as flammability or explosion limits are not exceeded. In this regard,<br>
particular care should be exercised when using oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide<br>
which can be explosive at elevated temperatures. Generally, oxidation processes in accordance<br>
with the present invention will take place at temperatures within the range of about 15° C to<br>
about 250° C and at pressures in the range of about 1 Bar to about 25 Bars, with most processes<br>
taking place at a temperature of oxidation within the range of about 50° C to about 200° C and<br>
pressure within the range of about 1 Bar to about 10 Bars. However, oxidation may take place at<br>
much higher pressures, particularly when using oxidants which are gaseous at NTP. Oxidation<br>
pressures of 70 Bars or more are useful with gaseous oxidants, with pressures up to 40 Bars<br>
being more likely for most process equipment and oxidants. The temperature and pressure at<br>
which oxidation occurs is dependent on the particular oxidant. Generally, residence times for<br>
the oxidation process will be within the range from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours, with<br>
most processes being within the range from about 1 hour to about 3 hours.<br>
For most processes and equipment using peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide as<br>
oxidants, the oxidation temperature will fall within the range of from about 15° to about 75° C.<br>
For most processes and equipment using oxygen and/or air as oxidants, the oxidation<br>
temperature range will be from about 100° to about 250° C. When ozone is used as an oxidant,<br>
in most processes and equipment, the oxidation temperatures will range form about 15° to about<br>
75° C.<br>
The oxidation treatment of this invention may be carried out on substantially the entire<br>
amount or only a portion of the acetaldehyde in any of the streams described previously, either<br>
by oxidizing substantially all the acetaldehyde in only a portion of the stream, or oxidizing only a<br>
portion of the acetaldehyde in the entire stream, or a combination of the two approaches.<br>
Moreover, it may be desirable in some instances to practice the oxidation treatment of the<br>
invention on more than one of the described acetaldehyde containing streams. Obviously,<br>
depending on how the process is specifically designed, carrying out an oxidation treatment on<br>
any of the described acetaldehyde containing streams will generally eliminate the need for units<br>
of an acetaldehyde removal system downstream of the stream subjected to such oxidation<br>
treatment or allow for reduced capacity of such downstream units thereby reducing or entirely<br>
eliminating a waste stream. The oxidation treatment method also results in an improved overall<br>
efficiency in the production of acetic acid by converting acetaldehyde to acetic acid.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, continuous streams of methanol and carbon monoxide are fed<br>
through lines 1 and 2 respectively into stirred reactor 3 containing a reaction liquid comprising<br>
an acetic acid solution of rhodium as catalyst, methyl iodide as halogen promoter, lithium iodide<br>
as salt copromoter/stabilizer, water, unreacted methanol and carbon monoxide and impurities<br>
such as acetaldehyde and other PRC"s, and higher alkyl iodides. Quantities of reactant streams<br>
entering, and catalyst components in the reaction section, as well as process parameters such as<br>
temperature, pressure and residence time, are within the ranges well known in the art for the<br>
carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide to produce acetic acid. Gases formed in the<br>
reaction section are withdrawn through line 4 and are sent to vent recovery for the separation of<br>
components suitable for recycle to the reaction. Reaction liquid is continuously withdrawn from<br>
reactor 3 through line 5 and is fed to flasher 6 where a reduction of pressure causes a portion of<br>
the acetic acid and most of the lower boiling compounds to be flashed off as vapor leaving a<br>
solution of the heavier components of the catalyst system. The liquid remaining in flasher 6 is<br>
recycled through line 7 to reactor 3 while the vapors from flasher 6 are fed through line 8 to light<br>
ends or "splitter" column 9 where most of the lower boiling components including methyl<br>
iodide, methyl acetate, and acetaldehyde, and a portion of the water are removed overhead. A<br>
crude aqueous acetic acid liquid is withdrawn from light ends column 9 through line 10 and sent<br>
to the acetic acid recovery system (not shown). A bottoms fraction comprising some acetic acid<br>
and higher boiling components is withdrawn from light ends column 9 through line 11 and<br>
recycled to the reaction section. The overhead vapor stream from the light ends column is<br>
condensed and fed through line 12 to separator/decanter 13, where the condensate separates into<br>
a light aqueous phase containing a preponderance of water, a substantial although minor<br>
proportion of acetic acid and much lower amounts of methyl iodide, methyl acetate and<br>
methanol, and a heavy organic phase containing a minor amount of water, a much larger<br>
percentage of methyl iodide and a smaller percentage of acetaldehyde than are present in the<br>
light aqueous phase. The light aqueous phase is fed through line 14 to oxidation vessel 15, to<br>
which is also fed an oxidizing agent through line 16 which oxidizes most of the acetaldehyde in<br>
the light aqueous phase to acetic acid or further to CO2 and H2O. Oxidation vessel 15 may be<br>
selected from a number of types of reactors such as a continuously stirred reactor or a co-current<br>
or counter current flow reactor in which any can be used with a catalyst. The reactor may also be<br>
a stirred vessel reactor or co-current or counter current reactor which may contain a fixed bed of<br>
oxidation catalyst. If the oxidizing agent is fed as a gas, or a gas by-product such as CO2 is<br>
produced, then the spent gas may be withdrawn through line 17, scrubbed to remove compounds<br>
such as methyl iodide and methyl acetate which may be recycled to the purification section or<br>
forwarded to the reaction section and a portion of the scrubbed gas is vented to remove inert<br>
gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide and a portion may be recycled to oxidation vessel 15<br>
with makeup oxidizing gas. The treated light aqueous phase is withdrawn from oxidation vessel<br>
15 and recycled to the purification section through line 19 or forwarded to the reaction section<br>
through line 18, or to both the purification section and the reaction section, while the heavy<br>
organic phase from separator/decanter 13 is directly recycled through line 20 to the reaction<br>
section.<br>
The following detailed examples illustrate the practice of the present invention in various<br>
forms. The principles of the invention and modifications thereof will be understood in view of<br>
the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-11<br>
Examples 1-11 (Run No. 1-11) set forth in Table I demonstrate control experiments<br>
using nitrogen and the use of air as an oxidizing agent in accordance with the present invention<br>
over various temperatures and pressures. Specifically, Examples 1-2 are comparative examples<br>
demonstrating the low levels of acetaldehyde conversion in the absence of an oxidizing agent<br>
used in accordance with the present invention. The words "Example" and "Runs" or "Run No."<br>
and "Example No." are used interchangeably herein<br>
Examples 1 -11 are experiments using a batch autoclave conducted on light phase streams<br>
removed from a separator/decanter 13 from the overhead condensate of light ends column 9<br>
shown in Figure 1 and employed in the purification of the product of a typical process for<br>
producing acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide utilizing a<br>
rhodium catalyst, methyl iodide as halogen promoter, and lithium iodide as salt<br>
stabilizer/copromoter.<br>
Table IV identifies the composition of the light phase stream used in each Run and the<br>
conditions (including temperature, pressure, and oxidation run time) under which each<br>
experiment was conducted. Table I also reports the acetaldehyde conversion as a percentage<br>
decrease of the acetaldehyde concentration in the light phase stream following the oxidation<br>
process. All compositions were determined by GC analysis.<br>
Examples 1-2 are control runs showing the level conversion of acetaldehyde ("AcH") in<br>
the absence of an oxidizing agent, ha these runs, nitrogen, rather than air, was charged in the<br>
batch autoclave reaction section. These experiments resulted in acetaldehyde conversion levels<br>
12% and 23% for inns 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
Examples 3-11 demonstrate acetaldehyde conversion levels ranging from 46% to 99%<br>
when air, as the oxidizing agent, is charged to the system at the various temperatures and<br>
pressures set forth in Table I. At an air pressure of 14.4 Bars, a temperature of 150° C, and a<br>
reaction time of one hour, 46% of the acetaldehyde was converted in Example 4. In Example 8,<br>
at an air pressure of 34.6 Bars, a temperature of 175° C, and a reaction time of two hours, 99%<br>
of the acetaldehyde was converted.<br>
EXAMPLES 12-23<br>
Examples 12-23 (Runs 12-23) set forth in Table II demonstrate the use of hydrogen<br>
peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidizing agent in accordance with the present invention over various<br>
temperatures and concentrations.<br>
Runs 12-23 are experiments using the batch autoclave conducted, again, on light phase<br>
streams removed from a separator/decanter 13 from the overhead condensate of light ends<br>
column 9 shown in Figure 1 and employed in the purification of the product of a typical process<br>
for producing acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide utilizing a<br>
rhodium catalyst, methyl iodide as halogen promoter, and lithium iodide as salt<br>
stabilizer/copromoter.<br>
Table IV identifies the composition of the light phase stream used in each run. Table II<br>
sets forth the conditions under which each run was conducted. Table II also reports the<br>
acetaldehyde conversion as a percentage decrease of the acetaldehyde concentration in the light<br>
phase stream following the oxidation process. All compositions were determined by GC<br>
analysis.<br>
The data in Tables II demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide is effective to convert<br>
acetaldehyde in acetic acid production process streams. It is seen that the percent conversion of<br>
acetaldehyde generally rises with increasing hydrogen peroxiderAcH mole ratio, time of<br>
reaction, and temperature.<br>
EXAMPLES 24-35<br>
Examples 24-35 (Runs 24-35) set forth in Table IE demonstrate the use of peracetic acid<br>
("ACO2H") as an oxidizing agent in accordance with the present invention over various<br>
temperatures and concentrations.<br>
Runs 24-35 are experiments using the batch autoclave conducted, again, on light phase<br>
streams removed from a separator/decanter 13 from the overhead condensate of light ends<br>
column 9 shown in Figure 1 and employed in the purification for the product of a typical process<br>
of producing acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide utilizing a<br>
rhodium catalyst, methyl iodide as halogen promoter, and lithium iodide as salt<br>
stabilizer/copromoter. Table IV identifies the composition of each light phase stream used in<br>
each run.<br>
Table III sets forth the conditions under which each run was conducted. Table III also<br>
reports the acetaldehyde conversion as a percentage decrease of the acetaldehyde concentration<br>
in the light phase stream following the oxidation process. All compositions were determined by<br>
GC analysis.<br>
As shown by the data in Table III, under certain conditions, peracetic acid is a more<br>
effective liquid oxidant of acetaldehyde than is hydrogen peroxide. At an AcO2H:AcII mole<br>
ratio of 2.1, most of the acetaldehyde is converted at reaction times less than 24 hours at 25°C,<br>
end substantially all the acetaldehyde is converted at 60°C. At ACO2H: AcH mole ratios of at<br>
least 4.14, 100% of the acetaldehyde was converted at less than 24 hours regardless of the<br>
temperature.<br>
The Examples described above demonstrate that higher levels of acetaldehyde<br>
conversion may generally be achieved by increasing the concentration of oxidizing agents, the<br>
temperature, total pressure, or residence time or a combination of these four variables. For<br>
example, comparing Examples 4 and 5 demonstrates the dependence of the acetaldehyde<br>
conversion on residence time. With all variables being held constant except for residence tune,<br>
the percent of acetaldehyde conversion increases from 46% to 95% by increasing the residence<br>
time from one to two hours. Comparing Examples 4 and 6 demonstrates an increase of<br>
acetaldehyde conversion from 46% to 82% by increasing the temperature from 150° C to 175°<br>
C. Likewise, comparing Examples 7 and 8, an increase in acetaldehyde conversion from 92% to<br>
99% was achieved by increasing pressure from 14.4 Bars to 34.6 Bars.<br>
As mentioned above, the process of the present invention is operative over a wide range<br>
of temperatures and pressures. By changing the process parameters set forth in Table I, one can<br>
optimize the conversion of acetaldehyde over this wide range of temperatures, pressures, and<br>
residence times. Of course, it is understood that most commercial processes will be designed to<br>
achieve a balance among the parameters that is economically attractive. Additionally, when<br>
using potentially explosive and flammable oxidizing agents such as oxygen and, peroxide,<br>
considerable care should be observed when operating at high temperatures and pressures.<br>
The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention are illustrative and explanatory<br>

the spirit and scope of the Claimed invention.<br>
