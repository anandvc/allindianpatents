				<td>RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Swedish application number 0202287-9, filed on July 19,2002, and U.S. provisional application 60/426,240, filed on November 14,2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for their preparation, as well as to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Many disorders and conditions of the central nervous system are influenced by the serotonergic neurotransmitter system. For example, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) has been implicated in a number of disorders and conditions that originate in the central nervous system. The serotonin receptors are divided into seven main classes 5-HT1- 5-HT7. Additionally, the 5-HT2 family of serotonin receptors is subdivided into the S-HTJA, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2c receptor subtypes. For reviews dealing with tlie classification and function characteristics of serotonin receptors, see for example; Hoyer, D. et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994,46,157-203; Saxena, P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995,66,339-368; Barnes, N.M. et al. Neuropharmacol. 1999,38,1083-1152; Roth, B.L. et al. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998,79, 231-257.<br>
The 5-HT2A receptor subtype is expressed in the human brain, including many cortical, limbic, and forebrain regions and is postulated to be involved in the modulation of higher cognitive and affective functions. The 5-HT2A receptor subtype is also expressed on mature blood platelets where it mediates, in part, platelet aggregation, one of the initial steps in the process of vascular thrombosis. Several lines of evidence strongly implicate the 5-HT2A receptor subtype in the etiology of such medical conditions as hypertension, thrombosis, migraine, vasospasm, ischemia, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, sexual<br><br>
function disorders, sleep disorders, and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. They may further be effective in the lowering of intraocular pressure and may therefore be benefiC1al in treatmg glaucoma (cf. T. Mano et al. and H. Takaneka et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis SC1. 1995,36,719 and 734, respectively). The compound (+)-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ethyl]-4-piperidinemethanol (also known as M-100907) has been shown to be a potent antagonist of human 5-. HT2A receptors and is described in WO 91/18602.<br>
The 5-HT2A receptor subtype has further been suggested to be involved in<br>
urological disorders such as diabetic nephropathy and urinary incontinence (diabetic nephropathy, see: Ishimura, E. et al. Nephron 1997, 76,227-229; urinary incontinence, including coexisting diabetes, see: Kodama, M. et al. Int. J. Urol 2000, 7,231-235 and Ichiyanagi, N. et al. J. Urol. 2002,168,303-307).<br>
Compounds that have an effect on the 5-HT2A receptor may therefore have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of disorders like those mentioned above.<br>
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE<br>

The said A"-alkylation reaction may be carried out in the presence of sodium iodide or potassium iodide in cases where Y in formula (VI) is other than iodine.<br>
For compoimds of formula (I) where R1 is H, R1 in the intermediate of formula (V) is a suitable protecting group, preferably fert-butoxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or trityl.<br>
The intermediates of formula (IV) may be prepared according to the methodology described in WO 00/76984 and as described in Example 54, Step 1, and Example 55, Step 1.<br>
Whan R1 is a nitrogen protecting group, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl (^BOC) or trityl, the subsequent iV-deprotection is carried out by conventional methods such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.<br>
An obtained compound of formula (I) above may be converted to another compound of formula (I) by methods well known in the art. Different groups may be<br><br>
introduced, such as C1-6-alkyl groups for R1 in the fonnula (I). The conditions may be those described in Example 52, Step 2; Example 53, Step 2; and Examples 60-63.<br>
The chemicals used in the above-described synthetic routes may include, for example, solvents, reagents, catalysts, protecting group and deprotecting group agents. The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described speC1fically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups m order to ulttinately allow synthesis of the compounds of any of the formulae described above, their salt forms, or compositions that include the compounds or their salt forms. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing applicable compounds of the fonnula (I) are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3   Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); L. Fieser and M.

Examples of addition salt forming aC1ds are maleic aC1d, malic aC1d, fumaric aC1d, sucC1nic aC1d, methanesulfonic aC1d, acetic aC1d, oxalic aC1d, benzoic aC1d, hydrochloric aC1d, sulphuric aC1d, phosphoric aC1d, and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and they may therefore be obtamed in the form of optical isomers, e.g. as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers (racemate) or as a mixture containing diastereomers. The separation of mixtures of optical isomers to obtain pure enantiomers is well known in the art and may, for example, be achieved by fractional<br><br>
crystallization of salts with optically active (chiral) aC1ds or by chromatographic separation on chiral colunms.<br>
The necessary starting materials for preparing the compounds of formula (I) are either known or may be prepared in analogy with the preparation of known compounds.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the compounds of formula (I), in the form of free bases or salts with physiologically acceptable aC1ds, can be brought into suitable galenic forms, such as compositions for oral use, for injection, for nasal spray administration or the like, in accordance with accepted pharmaceutical procedures. Such pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprise an effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) in assoC1ation with compatible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials, or diluents, as are well known in the art.

PREPARATION OF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
EXAMPLE: Preparation of tablets<br><br>
The active ingredient 1 is mixed with ingredients 2,3,4 and 5 for about 10 minutes. The magnesium stearate is then added, and the resultant mixture is mixed for about 5 minutes and compressed into tablet form with or without film-coating.<br>
Pharmacological methods<br>
The ability of a compound of the invention to bind or act at speC1fic 5-HT receptor subtypes can be determined using in vitro and in vivo assays known in the art. The biological activity of compounds prepared in the Examples was tested using different tests.<br><br>
Affinity assay<br>
The 5-HT2A receptor affinity of compounds in the Examples was detemiined in competition experiments, where the ability of each compound in serial dilution to displace 3H-labeled lysergic diethyl amide (LSD), bound to membranes prepared from a transfected CHO cell line stably expressing the human 5-HT2A receptor protein, was measured after rapid filtration through glass fiber filters. Non-speC1fic binding was defined using mianserin (5 µM). The 5-HT2A receptor affinity values are expressed as Ki values. Results obtained for exemplary compounds of the invention are illustrated in Table 1 below. The K, values for the compounds towards the human 5-HT2A realtor were in the range 0.1-1500 nM.<br>
Table 1. Human 5-HT2A receptor Affinity<br><br>
In vitro functional assay<br>
The antagonist activity at the 5-HT2A receptor of the compounds in the Examples of the present invention was judged from their inability to mobilise intracellular calC1um in transfected CHO cells, stably expressing the human 5-HT2A receptor protein, using the calC1um-chelating fluorescent dye FLUO-3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) at a substrate concentration of 1 pM. Additionally, the antagonist activity at the 5-HT2A receptor of the said compounds could be verified by<br><br>
their ability to inhibit 5-HT-induced calC1um release in transfected CHO cells, stably expressing the human 5-HT2A receptor protein, using cumulative dose-response<br>
techniques. From these experiments, the apparent functional inhibitory constant Kb could be estimated.<br><br><br>
