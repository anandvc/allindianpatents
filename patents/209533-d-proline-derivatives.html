Compounds of formula I-A and I-B are novel compounds with the exception of (R)-1-[(R)- and (R)-l-[(S)-3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl]-pyrrolidine-2-carboxilic acid. These compounds are described in WO 97/10225, having antibacterial activity against B. fragilis. Furthermore, they are described in J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. (1987), 1(2) 133-42 in a theoretical study of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.<br>
The compounds of formulae I-A or I-B may contain 4 or 2 asymmetric carbon atoms. Accordingly, the present invention includes all sterioisomeric forms of the compounds of formula I-A or I-B, including each of the individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the D-prolines of formula I-A and I-B can be used in the treatment or prevention of all forms of central and systemic amyloidosis, which is a disorder of protein metabolism in which normally soluble autologous proteins are deposited in the tissues as abnormal insoluble fibrils, which cause structural and functional disruption. The most common disorders associated with amyloidosis are Alzheimer's disease (AD), maturity onset diabetes mellitus, or amyloidosis<br>
-	as a significant cause of non-ischaemic heart failure,<br>
-	as complication of long term haemodialysis in renal failure,<br>
-	as complication of monoclonal gammopathies,<br>
-	from chronic inflammatory disorders,<br><br>
-	from chronic infections or<br>
-	from certain types of cancer.<br>
Furthermore, amyloidosis comprises many different diseases such as forms of hereditary amyloidosis most common familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), scrapie and Kreuzfeld-Jakob disease.<br>
The common pathological feature is extracellular deposition of so called amyloid proteins in b-structured fibers and the same staining characteristics.<br>
Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a normal plasma protein and the precursor of amyloid component, a universal constituent of the abnormal tissue deposits in amyloidosis. It is resistant to proteases and therefore plays a key role in the persistance of amyloid in vivo. For therapy pharmaceutically active compounds have to be found which would prevent the interaction of SAP with amyloid fibrils. This interaction has been demonstrated to be a protein fiber interaction, rather than an interaction with more general fiber components such as glycosaminoglycans.<br>
SAP consists as a pentamer of 5 identical non-covalently associated subunits. Two pentamers can non-covalently associate to a decamer with the two pentameric disk-like rings interacting face to face. SAP is a calcium-dependent ligand binding protein. It is produced and degraded exclusively in hepatocytes and extremely stabile outside the liver.<br>
The participation of SAP in the pathogenesis od amyloidosis in vivo confirms that inhibition of binding to amyloid fibrils is an attractive therapeutic target in a range of serious human diseases.<br>
Objects of the present invention are the aforementioned compounds of formula I-A and I-B and salts and esters thereof per se and as therapeutically active substances, their manufacture and their use for therapeutic purposes and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments as well as medicaments containing a compound of formula I-A and I-B or a salt thereof and the production of such medicaments for the said purpose.<br><br>
The term "lower alkyl" denotes straight-chain or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbon residues, preferably with 1-4 C atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 2-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl.<br>
"Halogen" denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine.<br>
5	Compounds of formula I-A and I-B can form salts with metals, e.g. alkali<br>
metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts or alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium salts, with organic bases, e.g. salts with amines such as N-ethylpiperidine, procaine or dibenzylamine, or salts with basic amino acids such as salts with arginine or lysine. These salts can be formed<br>
I    and isolated by methods well known in the art.<br>
The compounds can also be used in the ester form, such esters being aliphatic or aromatic, such as, for example alkyl and phenolic esters. The most preferred esters are alkyl esters derived from C1A alkanols, especially methyl and ethyl esters.<br>
The compounds of formulae I-A and I-B can also be used in form of their prodrugs at either one or both carbonyl functions. Examples are esters, intramolecular esters, phosphate esters, double esters, glycolamide esters, glyceride conjugates, dihydropyridine derivatives or 8-(hydroxymethyl)-l-naphthylmethyldisulfide esters. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain. (WO 9514705; H.

Compounds of formula I-A and I-B have been tested by the following method:<br>
Test method<br>
Binding of SAP (serum amyloid P) to human amyloid AfiQ-42) fibrils Nunc Flouro Polysorp 96 well plates were coated with 0.5 pg/well of AB1-42, which had been aged for 7 days at 37 °C. Plates were dried for 3 days at 37 °C, washed with 2 x 150 pi of TC (10 mM tris, 138 mM NaCl, 6 mM CaCl2, 0.05%<br>
NaN3 pH 8.0) with 1% bovine serum albumin. Then 50 pi TC containing 8%<br>
bovine serum albumin, 25 pi compound in TC and 25 pi 40 nM [1251] serum amyloid protein in TE (10 mM EGTA instead of Ca) were added per well. Incubation was performed over night at room temperature and wells were washed twice with 180 pi of TC containing 1% bovine serum albumin. To determine radioactivity 100 pi Microscint 40 were added per well and radioactivity was measured in a TopCount (Packard).<br>
The IC50 (pM) of preferred compounds of formula I-A and I-B are in the range ofaboutO.2-2.0.<br>
The compounds of formula I-A and I-B and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, their mono-and diesters and cyclic imides thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharma-ceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions, or nasally.<br><br>
For the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations the compounds of formulae I-A and I-B and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and esters thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oil, waxes, fats, semi-solid and hquid polyols and the Hke. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the Hke.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formulae I-A or I-B or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt or mono-and diesters thereof and a therapeutically inert varrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their manufacture which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I-A and I-B and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and mono-and diesters thereof into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
In accordance with the invention compounds of general formula I-A and I-B as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and mono-and diesters thereof can be used used in the treatment or prevention of central and systemic amyloidosis. The most common disorders associated with amyloidosis are Alzheimer's disease (AD), maturity onset diabetes mellitus, or amyloidosis<br><br>
-	as a significant cause of non-ischaemic heart failure,<br>
-	as complication of long term haemodialysis in renal failure,<br>
-	as complication of monoclonal gammopathies,<br>
-	from chronic inflammatory disorders,<br>
-	from chronic infections and<br>
-	from certain types of cancer.<br>
Furthermore, amyloidosis comprises many different diseases such as forms of hereditary amyloidosis most common familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), scrapie and Kreuzfeld-Jakob disease.<br>
Furthermore, the present compounds can be used for the manufacture of corresponding medicaments. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage lies in a range of about 0.1 mg per dosage to about 5000 mg per day of a compound of general formulae I-A or I-B or the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt or mono- and diesters thereof, although the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is shown to be indicated.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the present invention in more detail. However, they are not intended limit its scope in any manner. All temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
