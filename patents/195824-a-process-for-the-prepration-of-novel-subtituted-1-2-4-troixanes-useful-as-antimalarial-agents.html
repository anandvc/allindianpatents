More particularly the present invention provides preparation of 1,2,4-trioxanes of general formula 7 wherein X represents hydrogen, halo groups selected from bromo, chloro R1 and R2 represent hydrogen, alkyl group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl and decyl, aryl group selected from phenyl, or part of a cyclic system such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, substituted cyclohexane, cyclo(2.2.1)heptane, adamantane. These trioxanes are novel compounds and are useful as antimalarial agents. Some of these compounds have been tested against multi-drug resistant malaria in mice and have shown promising antimalarial activity. The invention, thus relates to pharmaceutical industry.<br>
The trioxanes of the general formula 7 are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel substituted 1,2,4-trioxanes useful as antimalarial agents.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel substituted 1,2,4-trioxanes useful as antimalarial agents of general formula 7 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein X repreents hydrogen, halo groups selected from bromo and chloro, R1 and R2 represent hydrogen alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl, aryl selected from phenyl or R1f R2 together represent part of a cyclic system such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, substituted cyclohexanes, bicyclo (2.2.1) heptane, adamantane which comprises reacting aryl methyl kenone of formula 1 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein X represents hydrogen, halo groups selected from bromo or chloro with haloacetate such as ethylbromoacetate or ethylchloroacetate and Zn in presence of catalytic amount of l2 in an aprotic solvent at a temperature ranging from room temperature to refluxing temperature to give p-hydroxyester of formula 2 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein X has the same meaning as above, dehydrating the above said p-hydroxyester using a dehydrating catalyst in an aprotic<br>
solvent at a temperature ranging from room temperature to refluxing temperature to give a,p-unsaturated ester of the formula 3 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein X has the same meaning as above, reducing the above said ester with a metal hydride in an ether solvent at a temperature ranging from 0°C to refluxing to obtain allylic alcohol of formula 4 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein X has the same meaning as above, photoxygenating the above said allylic alcohol in presence of a sensitizer in an organic solvent such as herein described at a temperature ranging from -10°C to room temperatures to obtain p-hydroxyhydroperoxide of the formula 5 of the drawing accompanying the specification with an aldehyde/ketone of the general formula 6 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein R1 and R2 represent hydrogen, alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and decyl, aryl selected from phenyl, and part of a cyclic system selected from group consisting of cyclopentane, cyclohexane, bicyclo (2.2.1) heptane, adamantane, in presence of an acid catalyst in an aprotic organic solvent at a temperature ranging from 0°C to room temperature, isolating and purifying by known methods to furnish novel substituted 1,2,4-trioxanes.<br>
In the process aryl methyl ketone of formula 1 of the drawing accompanying the specification are reacted with haloacetate such as ethyl bromoacetate or ethyl chloroacetate and Zn in presence of catalytic amount of I2 in an aprotic organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran to furnish p-hydroxy ester of formula 2.<br>
These p-hydroxy ester of formula 2 of the drawing accompanying the specification can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as column chromatography or can be used without purification in the next step, p-hydroxy ester of formula 2 where X=Br, CI are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier. Hydroxy ester of formula 2 where X=H is a known compound [Farmaco. Ed. Sci 1978,33(12),992-8 (Ital)].<br>
In the process dehydration of p-hydroxy ester of formula 2 of the drawing accompanying the specification may be effected in aprotic organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, CHCI3 in the presence of a dehydrating agent selected from l2, P2O5 p-toluene sulfonic   acid,   H2S04 or Amberlyst-15 (cation exchanger) to furnish α,ß-<br>
unsaturated esters of formula 3. These unsaturated esters can be isolated and punned by standard laboratory methods such as column chromatography using silica gel as an adsorbent and hexane/ethyl acetate as eluant. The α.ß-unsaturated ester of formula 3 where X=Br. CI are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier. The α. ß-unsaturated ester of formula 3 where X=H is a known compound [ Chemical Abstract. 1976, 86: P106177d].<br>
In the process reduction of a, ß-unsaturated ester of formula 3 is effected with a complex metal hydride such as UAIH4 in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, to furnish allylic alcohol of the formula 4. These allylic alcohol of formula 4 can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as crystallization or column chromatography on silica gel. The allylic alcohol of formula 4 are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process photooxygenation of allylic alcohol of formula 4 may be effected by passing oxygen gas or air in the solution of the alcohol in an organic solvent and in the presence of a dye and a light source which provides visible light for a period in the range of 2 :o 5 h, to furnish ß-hydroxyhydroperoxide of formula 5. These P-hydroxyhydroperoxide for formula 5 which are new chemical entities can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as crystallization or column chromatography or can be used in situ, without purification, in the next step. The dye which acts as a sensitizer i.e. converts 302 to highly reactive 'O2. may be selected from methylene blue, Rose Bengal, tetraphenylporphine and the like. Organic solvent used may be selected from CH2CI2, benzene, CH3CN, acetone, ethanol and the like.<br>
In the process reaction of P-hydroxyhydroperoxide of formula 5 with aldehyde/ketones of formula 6 is done in an aprotic solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst to furnish tnoxanes of formula 7. The aldehyde and ketones used may be such as benzaldehyde, acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, decyl methyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, bicyclic ketone such as norcamphor and tricyclic ketones such as 2-adamantanone. The acid catalyst used may be selected from HC1, p-toluenesulfonic acid, H2SO4, acidic resin like Amberlyst-15. The aprotic solvents used may be selected from CH2CI2, CHCI3, benzene, CH3CN. These tnoxanes of formula 7 can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as column chromatography and crystallization. These tnoxanes are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. Some of the tnoxanes of formula 7 have been tested against malarial parasites in mice and show promising antimalarial activity.In our copending patent application nf-159/02 ,we have claimed a process for preparation of novel tnoxanes<br>

ANTIMALARIAL ACTIVITY<br>
The antimalarial  activity of the test compounds was evaluated in rodent using multidrug<br>
resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii Nigeriensis in swiss mice.<br>
General  Procedure:   Random  bred  swiss  mice  of either  sex  (20+2gm)  were  inoculated<br>
intraperitoneally with lx105   P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero.   The treatment with test<br>
compounds were administered to group of 5 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 24-<br>
96 mg/kg/day. The treatment was administered via intramuscular route for 4 consecutive days (day<br>
0-3).<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular intervals till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the present suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated.<br>
For determining the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develop during the observation period has been reported as the curative dose. The anti-malarial data is summarized in table 4.<br>
