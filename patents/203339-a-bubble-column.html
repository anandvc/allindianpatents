A bubble column and the use thereof<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a bubble column wttich can be operated in counter-current flow, comprising horizontally disposed perforated trays in its middle part and to the use thereof for carrying out gas-liquid reactions. One special use is oriented towards the oxidation stage of the anthraquinone process for the production of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Bubble columns are columnar vessels in which a gas in the form of bubbles comes into contact with a liquid, wherein substances are mostly transferred from one phase into the other phase. Accordingly, bubble columns are also used for chemical reactions between components in a liquid phase and components in a gaseous phase.  In order to intensify mass transfer between the phases and to reduce back-mixing effects, a plurality of perforated trays disposed one above another can also be used in bubble columns (Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 5th Ed. (1992), Vol. 24, 276-278).<br>
The perforated trays of large-scale industrial bubble columns, namely those with a diameter of at least 1 m, are usually sieve plates with a hole diameter between 2 and 5 mm or dual flow trays with a hole diameter of up to 20 mm. Grids with a thin layer of customary packing material situated thereon are also used instead of sieve plates. The space-time yield of gas-liquid reactions is strongly dependent on the gas content in the gas-liquid mixture flow ing through the column. When employing bubble columns with the aforementioned sieve plates, it has not<br><br>
proved possible to increase the gas content above certain limiting values, and the space-time yield has thereby oeen limited. Therefore, there has been no lack of investigations aimed at increasing the space-time yield by means of other built-in components and/or by means of special injection means for the gas. However, the construction of bubble columns is made considerably more costly on an industrial scale by the use of the other built-in components mentioned above, for instance static mixers.<br>
DE 694 03 618 T2, which is a translation of EP 0 659 474 Bl, teaches at a method of for bringing a gas stream into contact with a liguid phase and an apparatus therefor. The apparatus comprises a column with perforated sieve trays, wherein the total surface area of the perforations is between one 1/40 and 1/300 of the cross-section which is available for perforations. The height of the liquid layer which is retained on the sieve trays and which is adjusted by means of weirs for example, preferably falls within the range from 200 to 600 mm. The cross-sectional area of the individual perforations falls within the range from 0.5 to 3.5 mm2.<br>
AT-PS 236 346 teaches special, perforated trays for columns such as those which are used for distillation and absorption processes. In addition to vertical apertures, the trays additionally contain a small number of apertures with walls which are inclined at a slant to the main face. The cross-sectional area of the apertures is a given as 0.155 to 31.7 mm2, and the surface area is 0.363 mm2, for example. In operation, a liquid flows over the trays. This document does not: teach that the column is operated as a bubble column.<br><br>
3<br>
DE-AS 10 28 096 teaches a method for the continuous reaction of finely distributed solids with liquids and/or gases. A column is used which is operated in co-current flow, which is completely filled with liquid and which comprises sieve trays, the holes in which have a diameter of less than 1 mm. A gas cushion inhibits the passage of liquid. The column does not a comprise devices for operation in counter-current flow.<br>
The bubble col umn cascade reactor according to DE-OS 2] 57 737 is substantially equivalent to the reactor acknowledged above. The total free hole area is preferably less than 5 % of the reactor cross-section, and there the hole diameters which are quoted in the examples are 2 or 4 mm (=0.78 to 12.56 mm2). This document does not mention counter-current operation and devices therefor.<br>
One large-scale industrial process based on a gas-liquid reaction is the oxidation stage in the anthraquinone process (AO process) for the production of hydrogen peroxide. As is known, this process comprises a hydrogenation stage, an oxidation stage and an extraction stage - a review is given in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 5th Ed. (1989), Vol. A13, 447-457. In the hydrogenation stage, a reaction medium which is based on one or more 2-alkylanthraquinones and/or tetrahydro derivatives thereof, and which is dissolved in a solvent system, is partially hydrogenated to form the corresponding hydroquinones, and in the oxidation stage the hydroquinones contained in the hydrogenated working solution are re-oxidised to quinones by a gas con taining O2, generally air, with the formation of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction in the oxidation stage shoulc be as quantitative as possible with the avoidance of decomposition reactions of components of the working<br><br>
4<br>
solution. Moreover, it should consume as little energy as possible and it should be capable of being conducted with a high space-time yield.<br>
In the AO process, oxidation is first conducted in gasification towers disposed in series, using fresh air in each case. This is both costly on an industrial scale and relatively uneconomic. According to US Patent Specification 3,073,680V the rate of oxidation can in fact be increased by maintaining defined bubble sizes, which can be obtained by means of fine-pored gas distributor elements such as frits, and by maintaining defined conditions of cross-sectional loading. However, problems arise with the separation of the resulting foam and with gas-liquid phase separation.<br>
According to German Patent Specification 20 03 268, the aforementioned problems associated with the AO process can be solved by means of an oxidation column which is subdivided into two to six sections. In each section of this column, the working solution and the oxidising gas are passed from the bottom to the top in co-current flow, but in the column as a whole the gas and the liquid move in countercurrent flow in relation to each other. In order to achieve intimate mixing, the individual sections contain suitable built-in components such as sieve plates or meshes, or are packed with packing elements.<br>
As an attempt to reduce the pressure drop in the aforementioned cascade-type arrangement of columns, European Patent Specification 0 221 931 proposes that oxidation be conducted in a tubular co-current reactor,<br>
which cor.tains no built in components apart from a special gas distributor element. This gas distributor element results in the formation, from the working solution and the oxidising gas, of a system in which<br><br>
5<br>
bubbles are inhibited from coalescing and which has a high gas content. If the gas content is too high and/or if the gas bubbles are particularly small, problems can  arise with gas-liquid separation. It has been shown in practice that the specific reactor volume to be gasified (in m3 per tonne H2O2) is quite larqe, which results in  a reduced space-time yield and also results in a high holdup of costly working solution.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a bubble column comprising perforated trays and which can be operated in counter-current flow,with which gas-liquid reactions can be conducted with a higher space-time yield than when using columns comprising customary sieve plates. The bubble column should be of simple, construction. A further object is oriented towards the use of the bubble column in the oxidation stage of the AO process for the production of hydrogen peroxide, wherein the conversion is improved compared with known processes, the space-time yield with respect to the reactor volume and the volume of working solution is improved, and the formation of a gas-liquid mixture which is difficult to separate is avoided.<br>
This object is achieved by a bubble column comprising a columnar vessel (1) having a bottom (2), middle (3) and top part (4), one or more perforated trays (5) horizontally disposed in the middle part, and devices for feeding and discharging a liquid phase (9 and 10) and a gas phase (11 and 12) in order to-operate the bubble column in co-current flow or counterflow, which is characterised in that the perforated trays (5) have a substantially uniform distribution of holes over the cross-section of the column, the cross-sectiona] area of the individual holes is 0.003 to 3 mm2, and the open area of the trays is 2 to 20 %. The subsidiary claims are<br><br>
6<br>
oriented towards preferred embodiments of the bubble column.<br>
Compared with bubble columns comprising conventional sieve plates, the bubble columns according to the invention are characterised by trays with fine holes or fine slits.  The trays preferably contain holes with a cross-sectional area of 0.01 to 1 mm2, particularly 0.05 to 0.5 mm2, the open area preferably falls within the range from 3 to 15 %, particularly 2 to 10 %, most preferably 3 to 7 %. The shape of the holes is arbitrary, but the holes are usually of round, triangular to semi-elliptical, or slit-shaped construction. The trays comprising fine holes or fine slits can be constructed as complete column trays, but usually consist of a supporting grid and of a plate which is fixed thereon, which comprises fine holes or fine slits and which is of the desired plate thickness and degree'of perforation. Plates of this type comprising fine holes or slits are in fact used in sieving and filtration technology and as fluidising bases in fluidised bed technology. Their use as trays in bubble columns has never been considered previously, however.<br>
As determined by their manufacture, the holes in the plates are preferably of tapered construction in the direction of passage of the gas and/or the holes are inclined in addition for the purpose of achieving a directed flow during the passage of the gas. A directed flow can additionally be effected by the scale which is formed on the surface of the plate due to the manufacture thereof.<br>
The bubble column is divided by the finely perforated trays into a plurality of zones, which in the operating state in the middle part of the bubble column, with the<br><br>
7<br>
exception of a thin gas cushion, are completely filled with liquid or with the liquid-gas mixture. So that operation without problems can be ensured when using counter-current flow, the bubble column comprises, on each tray, at least one tubular or well-shaped liquid passageway (6), termed a downcomer, between adjacent zones. These passageways, which advantageously begin directly on the tray, and which therefore make a weir unnecessary, dip into the liquid in the zone below the respective tray or are connected thereto. They are designed so that: no gas Mows through them in the operating state. This is achieved, for example, by arranging for the downcomers to be in the form of round pipes or segment-shaped wells which are disposed on the perforated tray, and for a corresponding free cross-section thereof to lead into an immersion pocket. Alternatively, external pipes which each connect two adjacent zones can also be used.<br>
The bubble column is usually constructed so that it can be operated in counter-current flow, wherein a liquid is fed in at the top and a gas is fed in at the bottom. In the presence of the device (6)for the passage of liquid, the bubble column can also be operated in co-current flow, wherein the liquid-gas mixture flows from the bottom to the top.<br>
The tray spacing in the bubble column according to the invention depends on the specific application and on the diameter-to-height ratio of the bubble column. In general, the tray spacing falls within the range from 0.1 to 10 times, particularly 0.5 to 5 times, the tray diameter. In large-scale industrial bubble columns, such as those which are employed in the use according to the invention for the production of hydrogen peroxide for example, the tray spacing of the trays comprising fine<br><br>
8<br>
holes or fine slits advantageously falls within the range -from 0.5 times to twice the tray diameter.<br>
Apart from said trays, which for operation in countercurrent flow are advantageously each equipped with at least one tubular or well-like liquid passage, the middle part of the column can be free from built-in components. According to one preferred embodiment, however, it is also possible for heat exchangers to be disposed between individual trays. These are advantageously plate heat exchangers comprising vertically placed plates. Bubble columns of this type, which are equipped with trays comprising fine holes and with heat exchangers, can be used particularly advantageously for carrying out gas-liquid reactions for which the enthalpy of reaction is high. The bubble columns according to the invention can be equipped in the manner familiar to one skilled in the art for operation in co-current or countercurrent flow, preferably in countercurrent flow. A cascade-like arrangement is also possible.<br>
As can be seen from the examples according to the invention and from the comparative examples, extraordinary, unforeseeable advantages are achieved due to the design according to the invention comprising perforated trays in the bubble column:<br>
o	gasification of a liquid situated above the plates<br>
comprising fine holes or slits is extremely uniform;<br>
o	small bubbles with a narrow range of diameters are<br>
produced uniformly over the entire cross-sect ion cf the bubble column;<br><br>
9<br>
o	the efficiency of the intensive mass transfer which is<br>
due to the trays enables the specific gasification<br>
volume (= effective reactor volume) to be reduced<br>
compared with bubble columns comprising sieve plates;<br>
o	the gas content of the gas-liquid mixture which can be<br>
attained in practice is significantly greater than the<br>
gas contents which can be obtained when using<br>
conventional sieve plates and in other gasification<br>
techniques, without this result ing in problems in gas-<br>
liquid phase separation;<br>
o	the mass transfer area, and the extent of mass transfer<br>
which is achieved therewith, is very high;<br>
o	compared with conventional columns, the hold-up of the<br>
liquid phase is significantly reduced; in particular,<br>
this is a considerable advantage if the liquid phase is<br>
a costly multi-component mixture, for instance the<br>
working solution of the AO process;<br>
o	a higher reaction conversion is achieved per m3 of<br>
reactor volume compared with competing processes;<br>
o	a higher reaction conversion is achieved per m3 of<br>
liquid phase {e.g. the working solution in the AO<br>
process);<br>
o	the pressure drop across the trays is about '300 to 500<br>
Pa (3-5 mbar) per  tray, and is therefore low compared<br>
with the hydrostatic pressure drop in the column; a gas<br>
cushion with a depth of only 1 to 5 cm is formed under<br>
the trays, so that practically the complete apparatus<br>
volume (= the middle part of the column) can be<br>
utilised for the reaction.<br><br>
10<br>
The Figure is a diagram of a preferred bubble column 1 according to the invent ion, which is particularly suitable for countercurrent flow operation and which in its middle part 2 contains three heat exchangers 16 in addition to six trays comprising fine holes 5. Apart from the gasified middle part 2, the column comprises a bottom part 3 with a cap-shaped gay dist. ributor device 8 and a top part 4 with a device 7 for distributing the liquid phase and a qas-liquid separation device connected to 14. A well-snapcc element 6 in trie shape of a segment for the passage of liquid is disposed on each finely perforated tray in the zone below the tray. The liquid phase is supplied via line 9 at the top of the column and is discharged via line 10 at the bottom part. The gas is supplied via line 11 to the gas distributor device 8, from which fine gas bubbles emerge. After passing through the column, the gas is separated from the liquid phase in the gas separation device, which is schematically illustrated as a centrifugal separator here, and is discharged as an off-gas via line 12. It is possible to check whether foam has been formed in the region of the column top by means of the sight glasses 15. The flow and return lines 17; 18 of each heat exchanger supply the heat exchanger with a heat transfer medium.<br>
The bottom and- top parts of the bubble column can be designed in any desired manner. In particular, customary units can be incorporated for supplying a gas and a liquid and for phase separation.<br>
The bubble column according to the invention can be used for carrying out reactions between a component of a gas phase and a component of a 1iquid phase. Gas-1iquid reactions such as these can comprise oxidation, reduction, addition or neutralisation reactions, for<br><br>
11<br>
example, wherein the liquid phase can be aqueous or organic. During the reaction, the two phases can be brought into contact with each other in co-current flow or in countercurrent flow, preferably in countercurrent flow, in the bubble column. At the same time, a plurality of bubble columns can be connected in series in the form of a cascade. Apart from one or more reaction components, the liquid phase can additionally contain a catalyst in dissolved or suspended form. When substances are suspended in the liquid phase, their particle diameters must be significantly smaller than the diameter of the holes in the trays comprising fine holes or fine slits.<br>
According to one preferred use, the bubble column according to the invention is employed in the oxidation stage of the anthraquinone process for the production of hydrogen peroxide. The liquid phase here is a hydrogenated working solution which contains one or more reaction media from the 2-alkylanthrahydroquinone and 2-alkyltetrahydroanthrahydroquinone series, and the gas phase is an oxygen-containing gas such as air, oxygen, or an oxygen-air mixture. The two phases are preferably brought into contact in countercurrent flow for oxidation, wherein the gas phase is supplied by means of a customary gas distributor device disposed in the bottom part of the bubble column, for example a perforated cap, and the liquid phase is supplied in the top part by means of a customary liquid distributor device. Distribution of the liquid is preferably effected by irrigating a considerable part of the column cross-section. This procedure makes it possible reliably to avoid problems of foaming at the top of the bubble column, such as the problems which occur when using other types of bubble columns, particularly columns disposed in cascade which are described in the prior art, and which can result in<br><br>
12<br>
losses of working solution due to the discharge thereof with the oxidation off-gas.<br>
Moreover, by using a bubble column according to the invention which comprises integrated heat exchanger plates, it is possible to conduct the oxidation stage almost isothermally. This has a positive effect on the reaction conversion. Furthermore, it also avoids the"need to remove working solution from the oxidation stage for the purpose of external cooling. As is shown in the following examples and comparative examples, a considerably higher space-time yield is achieved in the process for the production of hydrogen peroxide by employing a bubble column according to the invention in the oxidation stage. It has been shown that this increase is possible even if the process is operated at a low temperature and under a reduced pressure. By keeping the conditions of temperature and pressure constant, it is thus possible to obtain a further increase in space-time yield (STY). As an alternative to increasing the space-time yield, or in addition thereto, the cost of compressing the oxidising air can be minimised and a saving in energy can thus be achieved.<br>
Apart from their use as reaction columns, bubble columns comprising separating trays according to the invention can also be used for rectification, absorption and desorption processes. Due to the uniform gas distribution, to the small bubbles and, if need be, to the directed gas flow from the fine holes, very good rates of mass transfer and high extents of loading are possible.<br><br>
13<br>
Examples 1 to 3<br>
The oxidation stage of the anthraquinone process for the production of hydrogen peroxide was conducted in a large-scale industrial bubble column using a bubble column according to the invention as -shown in Figure, and using air as the oxidising gas. The working solution (WS) contained, as the reaction medium, a mixture stemming from many years of operation based on 2 ethyl- and 2-amylanthraquinono and on the tetrahydroanthraqua nones thereof in a solvent mixture which was essentially based on an aromatic petroleum compound and tet rabutylurea.<br>
The bubble column comprised six trays comprising fine holes, which had a cross-sectional area of about 0.05 mm2/hole and an open area of about 5 %, three plate heat exchangers, a cap-shaped perforated gas distributor device, an irrigation device at the top of the column and a centrifugal separation device for phase separation at the top of the column.<br>
The essential operating data and the results of Examples 1 and 2 are given in Table 1. Data on Example 3 were obtained from a comparative assessment trial and are given in Table 2 by comparison with corresponding data from the comparative examples.<br><br>
14<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Comparative example 1<br>
Oxidation of a hydrogenated working solution was conducted in an installation according to EP-B 0 221 931, i.e. the oxidising gas and the working solution were mixed directly by means of a mixer element and were introduced into the bottom part of a column which was free from built-i n components and which constituted a system in which bubble coalescence was inhibited. The working solution used in t.his operation contained a reaction medium based on 2-ethylanthraquinone and '?.-<br><br>
15<br>
ethyltetrahydroanthraquinone in a solvent mixture with the same basis as that used in Example 1.<br>
The essential operating data, and the space-time yield with respect to 1 m3 of working solution, arc given in Table 2. The gas content and the space-time yields of the gas-liquid mixture were less than those in the Example<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Comparative example 2<br>
A working solution analogous to that of comparative example 1 was oxidised with air in a three-stage cascade according to DE 20 03 268. Each of the three bubble columns contained a sieve plate with a hole diameter of 3 mm in the middle part of the column. The essential operating data and the space-time yields are given in Table 2..The gas content and the STY were less than those in the example according to the invention.<br><br>
