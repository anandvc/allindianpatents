DEVICE TO PRODUCE CUSHION-SHAPED, PREFERABLY STUFFED, HOLLOW<br>
BODIES<br>
The invention relates to a device to produce cushion-shaped hollow bodies which are restricted at opposite ends through squeezed or crimped edges.<br>
The production of edible hollow articles is known from Patent Document EP 774 209 Bl and/or WO 02/071848 Al.<br>
The EP 774 209 Bl discloses the production of edible hollow articles from extruded chocolate tubes, which can be shaped by kneading. The tube passes after extrusion through two stationary squeezing tools which are alternately activated, and which cut the respective end sections of the tube protruding from the extruder, thereby producing horizontally and/or vertically squeezed edges.<br>
Patent Document WO 02/071848 Al reveals the production of edible hollow articles from a hollow dough which can be shaped by kneading. The dough is conveyed in longitudinal direction by a horizontal transport path, along the two length-wise stretched-out squeezing devices, which are provided such that they mutually overlap each other. These devices have squeezing/crimping tools, movable in longitudinal direction of the transport path, and which come into action alternately at the start of the conveyor path/belt. These tools fragment the hollow dough placed on the conveyor belt alternately by generating a horizontal and vertical squeezed edge.<br>
In both cases the performance efficiency is not very high. In order to achieve a long-lasting closure of the ends as a result of the squeezed edges, it is necessary to have in all squeezing tools a marked delaying of the squeezing process through which the crimped edges are generated immediately before the final separation through cutting of the respective area of the tube which is already flattened by pressing. This presupposes a slow, or a relative movement delayed by a pause, of both the squeezing jaws, executing the squeezing operation. However, the quantity of cushion-shaped hollow bodies produced per time-unit is considerably restricted.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention proposes a device to produce simultaneously several cushion-shaped hollow bodies, which are limited or restricted at the opposed ends by squeezed or crimped edges. The device encompasses a feeding system for the tube and a squeezing device which fragments the tube into cushion-shaped hollow bodies. The device is equipped with a drop shaft or tunnel, which conveys the tube cross-wards to its longitudinal direction of the squeezing device. The squeezing device includes a length-wise stretched-out squeezing system, aligned to the longitudinal direction of the tube. The squeezing device may also have two or more length-wise stretched-out squeezing systems, arranged adjacent to each other and respectively aligned to the longitudinal direction of the tube. Each squeezing system has a series of squeezing tools, arranged longitudinally one after the other, which are fixed stationary on the frame, and has one each of a stationary squeezing jaw fixed to the frame, and a movable squeezing jaw positioned opposite in cross direction, fixed to a carriage on the frame capable of moving backward and forward in transverse direction.<br>
Under the invention-based device the tube passes the drop-shaft and reaches transverse to its longitudinal direction a long stretched-out squeezing system of the squeezing device, in which the movable squeezing jaw in cross direction is withdrawn and the squeezing tools are open. In order to fragment the tube, the movable squeezing jaws are moved forward in cross-direction with the help of the carriage which carries them, and the squeezing tools are closed. Thereby all squeezing tools of a squeezing system are always closed simultaneously. The tube brought into an open squeezing system is fragmented in one single operation to multiple hollow bodies following each other in longitudinal direction.<br>
In the invention-based device the squeezing procedure of the squeezing tools is executed by the carriage which carries the movable squeezing jaw of the squeezing tool. This squeezing procedure is controlled by the movement of the relevant carriage. The movement of the carriage can be combined with a longer pause.<br>
In the invention-based device the squeezing tools of the long stretched-out squeezing systems are always activated simultaneously. The movable squeezing jaws of a squeezing system can be arranged on two or more transverse moving movable carriages, which are moved in order to activate the squeezing tools, synchronously backward and forward. The movable squeezing jaws<br><br>
of a 'squeezing system can be arranged on a single, in cross-direction maneuverable carriage, which fragments a tube in the squeezing system with its carriage movement into multiple, cushion-shaped hollow bodies. A carriage in the frame of the device maneuverable in cross direction can carry the movable squeezing jaws of two or more adjoining squeezing systems. With the movement of this carriage the tubes in the squeezing systems are then fragmented simultaneously into multiple, cushion-shaped hollow pieces.<br>
According to the invention, each squeezing system can have two tool holders extending in longitudinal direction, and in cross-direction opposed to each other, with one of the tool holders carrying the stationary squeezing jaws of the squeezing tools of the squeezing system and being fixed/anchored in the frame, and the other tool holder carrying the movable squeezing jaws of the squeezing tools of the squeezing system arranged in the framework such that it can be moved in transverse direction.<br>
The usage of tool holders makes the replacement of squeezing jaws and the change of products easier. For a product change, only the tools of the respective tool holders corresponding to the hitherto product need to be removed and replaced by tool holders corresponding to the respective new product. Thereby the tool holders having straight/linear, vertically aligned squeezing edges can be exchanged with tool holders fitted with squeezing jaws with differently-formed or differently-aligned edges. Tool holders where squeezing jaws carry identically aligned vertical or slanted edges can be exchanged with tool holders having squeezing jaws which carry edges alternately twisted against each other.<br>
According to the invention a squeezing system can have successive squeezing tools in longitudinal direction, where the squeezing jaws carry squeezing edges which are preferably twisted by 90° against each other. This formation enables the production of hollow bodies which have at the opposed ends twisted, preferably by 90°, against each other twisted end edges.<br>
With the invention-based device, a squeezing device can be visualized with two squeezing systems, which are placed on two lengths-wise stretched, adjacently arranged in transverse direction, and which can be operated alternately through a carriage which can be moved in cross/transverse direction, where the movable squeezing jaws of one of the squeezing systems are arranged in the inner squeezing device back to back with the stationary squeezing jaws of the other squeezing system, and the movable squeezing jaws of both the systems on the carriage. In<br><br>
these' devices two tubes can be simultaneously fragmented into individual hollow bodies, thus enabling a higher output of hollow bodies.<br>
With the invention-based device a squeezing device can be visualized with two squeezing systems, which are placed on two length-wise stretched, and adjacently in transverse direction arranged, and which can be operated alternately through a carriage which can be moved in transverse direction, where the movable squeezing jaws of both systems are arranged in the inner of the squeezing device back-to-back and anchored to the carriage, and the opposite stationary squeezing jaws of the two squeezing systems are anchored to the frame of the squeezing device. The alternating actuation of both squeezing systems enable to drastically enlarge/extend the time gap available for sealing the respective flat-pressed positions of the tube in both squeezing systems without major reduction in the output of hollow bodies.<br>
According to the invention, both squeezing systems can have respectively two lengths-wise extended juxtaposed tool holders, where stationary squeezing jaws of the squeezing systems are foreseen as outer tool holders anchored on the frame, and for the movable squeezing jaws of the squeezing system as inner tool holders anchored on the carriage. This design simplifies and makes it easy to exchange and maintain the squeezing tools of the squeezing system.<br>
According to the invention the carriage maneuverable in cross direction can have a cover hood, which divides the drop-shaft or chute of the squeezing device into two partial chutes adjacentl&gt; placed in cross direction.<br>
According to the invention each squeezing system can be specifically assigned with a hood: one stationary hood anchored to the frame for the stationary squeezing jaws of the squeezing system and one transverse movable hood for the movable squeezing jaws of the squeezing system, providing between these two hood-parts of a squeezing system an entry-slit/slot for the tubes.<br>
The invention-based device may be equipped with one hood for both the squeezing systems adjacently arranged and operable through a carriage which can be moved crosswards and one hood side anchored to the frame for the stationary squeezing jaws of both squeezing systems, and a central hood-part arranged between the side hood-parts and anchored to the carriage and having a convex or gable shaped top side for the squeezing jaws of both squeezing systems anchored to the carriage where for each squeezing system an entry slit for the tube is provided.<br><br>
Under the invention-based device, the drop-shaft, conveying the tubes crosswise to their longitudinal direction of a squeezing device, can be limited on at least one of its front sides by a piloting device assigned to the ends of the tubes. This piloting device supports the conveying of the tubes to the squeezing device.<br>
According to the invention, every piloting device can be arranged on a transverse running front wall of the drop-shaft and can have an endless tape, around the front wall of the drop-shaft, and restricts the drop-shaft at the front side.<br>
As per the invention, the piloting device can be designed as stripping device, with a circulating endless band or tape which strips the filling mass emerging from the ends of the tubes and conveys it to a tape cleansing device provided outside of the drop-shaft.<br>
This design is advantageous for the processing of filled tubes as cushion-shaped hollow bodies.<br>
According to the invention squeezing tools which can be heated can be provided, where preferably at least stationary squeezing jaws can be electrically heated. This formation is advantageous for durable closing of the squeezing edges bordering the cushion-shaped hollow bodies produced by the squeezing tools.<br>
According to the invention an infrared radiator can be provided on each squeezing system on top of the squeezing tools for heating up the squeezing tools.<br>
The invention is explained in the following paragraphs with the help of several design examples illustrated in the drawings.<br>

Description of design examples:<br>
Fig. 1-3 show a device to produce simultaneously several, cushion-shaped hollow bodies from kneadable, filled or un-filled tubes. The tubes R are fed crosswise to their longitudinal axis to a squeezing device, in which they are fragmented into single hollow pieces, which then fall downwards out of the device.<br>
The device has a feeding equipment 1 for the tube R. The feeding equipment 1 provides an inclined slide 2 and a drop-shaft 3 connected to it. The tube is conveyed crosswise to its longitudinal axis via the slide 2 to the drop-shaft 3. The drop-shaft 3 conducts the tube R crosswise to its longitudinal axis to a squeezing device 4. This has a squeezing system 6, stationarily arranged on a frame 5 with a lengthwise stretched working/processing area aligned to the tube's longitudinal axis. Along the working area, several squeezing tools 7 are provided consecutively in longitudinal direction respectively in cross direction aligned. The squeezing tools 7 are stationary on the frame 5.<br>
Each squeezing tool 7 foresees a stationary fixed squeezing jaw 8 in frame 5 positioned opposite to a movable squeezing jaw 9 in cross-direction. The movable squeezing jaw 9 is mounted on carriage 10 which can move on the frame 5 crosswise bi-directionally. In order to open the squeezing tool 7, the movable squeezing jaw 9 is carried/pulled away back from the stationary squeezing jaw 8 through the movement of the carriage 10. In order to activate the squeezing tool 7, the movable squeezing jaw 9 is moved forward, to the stationary squeezing jaw 8 through the movement of the carriage 10. The movements of the carriage 10 are generated by a working cylinder 11 connected to it.<br><br>
For each squeezing tool 7 a carriage of its own which can move up and down can be provided.<br>
The squeezing system in Fig. 1-3 has only one, in crosswise bi-directionally movable carriage. The carriage 10 carries the movable squeezing jaws 9 of all squeezing tools 7 arranged successively in longitudinal direction in the squeezing system 6. Due to the bi-directional movement of the carriage 10, all squeezing tools 7 of the squeezing system 6 are always activated simultaneously.<br>
During the operation state of the device in Fig. 1-3, tube R is brought via the feeding equipment i into the squeezing system 6 where it is fragmented in crosswise direction, through the activation of the squeezing tools 7. The resultant cushion-shaped hollow pieces fall downwards out of the squeezing system 6. Tube R reaches via slide 2 and the drop-shaft 3 the working area of the squeezing system 6 opened through the withdrawing of the carriage 10. There it lands between the separately driven squeezing jaws 8, 9 of the squeezing tools 7. In the open squeezing system 6 the tube R is captured by two bottom support arms 12, each of which is arranged adjacent to a front end of the squeezing system 6. Subsequently the squeezing system 6 is activated. The cylinder 11 pushes the carriage 10 in cross-direction forward. The movable squeezing jaws 9 fixed to the carriage 10 push the tube R on the lower supporting arms 12 lying crosswise direction forward. The movable squeezing jaws 9 push the tube R towards stationary squeezing jaws 8 attached to the frame 5. During this movement of the carriage, the tube R is kneaded by each of the tools 7, in certain areas pressed flat and separated at the flattened area. After the separation of the flattened areas of the tube R, the carriage 10 is again withdrawn by the working cylinder 11 in cross direction in order to open the squeezing system 6. Now the next tube R can be brought into the open squeezing system 6 and a new work cycle of carriage 10 activating the squeezing tools 7 can start.<br>
The squeezing system 6, depicted in Fig. 1-3 has in longitudinal direction consecutive squeezing tools 7, 7' with squeezing edges 8a, 9a and 8a', 9a' alternatingly distorted against the vertical and/or by 45° to the right. Thereby cushion-shaped hollow bodies 13 with flattened squeezing edges with an off-set of 90° to each other (Fig. 6) are generated.<br>
The squeezing system 6 has two juxtaposed tool holders 14 and 15 (Fig. 4,5). The tool holder 14 firmly fixed in frame 5 carries in line arranged successively, stationary squeezing jaws 8, 8' of the<br><br>
squeezing tool 7. The tool holder 15 anchored to the carriage 10 carries the movable squeezing jaws 9, 9' of the squeezing tools 7 arranged in a line successively.<br>
The squeezing device 4 is provided with a hood which is assigned to the squeezing system 6. The hood has a stationary cover-part 16 fixed to the frame 5 and covers the stationary squeezing jaws 8 of the squeezing system 6. Moreover the hood has a movable cover-part 17 fixed to the carriage 10 of the squeezing system 6 which can move in cross direction and covers the movable squeezing jaws 9 of the squeezing system 6. The two cover-parts 16, 17 form a downwards tapering flute or channel for the entry of the tube R into the working area of the squeezing system 6. This flute at its bottom end converges with an entry slit running along the working area of the squeezing system 6, which is bordered by opposite edges of the two cover-parts 16, 17. The entry slit is opened and closed by the hood 17 mounted on the carriage 10, itself moving with the carriage.<br>
A further design form of a device to produce simultaneously multiple, cushion-shaped hollow bodies foresees a squeezing device with two or more extended squeezing systems aligned respectively to the longitudinal direction of the tube, arranged in cross direction side by side. With this device the tube is conveyed to the squeezing device via a feeding equipment, which has feed sections assigned to the individual squeezing systems and is equipped with a drop-shaft. The squeezing systems have work areas extended in length and aligned to the longitudinal direction of the tube together with consecutively arranged squeezing tools. The squeezing tools are respectively formed from a stationary squeezing jaw and a movable squeezing jaw. For neighboring systems the stationary squeezing jaws of a squeezing system are arranged back to back with the movable squeezing jaws of the neighboring squeezing system. The movable squeezing jaws of the squeezing system are mounted on a carriage which can be moved up and down in cross direction, which activates simultaneously the squeezing systems of the squeezing device. In order to ensure a consistent squeezing operation at all tools activated by the carriage simultaneously, the squeezing jaws can be supported on the frame or carriage with a spring action.<br>
Fig. 7-9 show a squeezing device 19 mounted on a frame 18, with two adjacently stretched-out squeezing systems 20, 21. On the frame 18 the squeezing systems 20, 21 are bordered at their opposite outer edges by carriers/beams 18a, 18b running parallel in longitudinal direction. The squeezing systems 20, 21 have working areas 22, 23 parallel to each other with squeezing tools in<br><br>
longitudinal direction arranged consecutively. The squeezing tools have juxtaposed squeezing jaws, aligned cross-ward to the longitudinal direction of the tubes R, of which the outer, stationary squeezing jaws 24, 25 are arranged on the outer borders of the squeezing systems 20, 21, whereas the inner, movable squeezing jaws 26, 27 are fixed to the carriage moving up and down transverse to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 20, 21 in the interior of the squeezing device 19. The outer squeezing jaws 24, 25 stick out respectively towards the inside from an outer/external tool holder 24a, 25a, which is fixed to the beam 18a or 18b of the frame 18 at the outer border of the squeezing system 20, 21. The inner squeezing jaws 26, 27 stick out towards outside from an inner tool holder 26a, 27, fixed to the carriage 28. The inner tool holders 26a, 27a of the two squeezing systems 20, 21 are anchored to the carriage 28 facing away fron each other. This is moved bi-directionally in the frame transverse to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 20, 21 by an associated working cylinder 29.<br>
In squeezing device 19 a hood consisting of several hood-parts 30, 31, 32 covers the outer and the inner tool holders of both squeezing systems 20, 21. The outer tool holders 24a, 25a of the squeezing systems 20, 21 are respectively covered by a, stationary side cover-part 30, 31, which is fastened to the frame 18. Between the two stationary cover-parts 30, 31 a center cover-part 32 is planned, which is mounted to the carriage 28 and there covers the inner tool holders 26a, 27a of the two squeezing systems 20, 21. In each squeezing system 20, 21 the stationary side cover-part 30, 31, together with the center cover-part 32 mounted to the carriage 28, forms a downwards tapering flute, which at its bottom runs into an entry slit for the tube R allocated to the working area 22, 23 of the squeezing system 20, 21.<br>
The two squeezing systems 20, 21 have successive longitudinally arranged squeezing tools, in which the squeezing edges are twisted alternately 45° against the vertical to the left and 45° to the right (Fig. 8, 9). Both squeezing systems 20, 21 produce cushion-shaped hollow bodies, having flat and mutually twisted/distorted by 90°end edges.<br>
In the squeezing device 19 the two squeezing systems 20, 21 are alternately activated by carriage 28 alternately moving up and down through the help of the working cylinder 29 and the tube R alternately conveyed to the squeezing system 20, 21 is respectively fragmented into single, cushion-shaped hollow pieces.<br><br>
Fig. 7 and 9 show the squeezing device 19 with a carriage 28 shifted towards the right, after the activation of the right squeezing system 21. If carriage 28 in Fig. 7, 9 is shifted towards the left, the left squeezing system 20 is activated and the right squeezing system 21 is opened. In the left squeezing system 20 the movable squeezing jaws 26 are moved towards the stationary squeezing jaws 24 and the tube R placed between them is locally pressed flat and partitioned into hollow bodies. Together with carriage 28 the central cover-part 32 moves towards the left. Thereby the entrance slit of the left squeezing system 20 located on the left of the center cover-part 32 is closed and the entrance slit of the right squeezing system 21 on the right of the center cover-part 32 is opened. The movable squeezing jaws 27 at the right squeezing system 21 are moved with the carriage 28 towards the left and are moved away from the stationary squeezing jaws 25. After the activation of the left squeezing system 20, the carriage 28 is shifted to the left in the squeezing device 19 and assumes the position shown in Fig. 8. The tube R is conveyed to the open, right squeezing system 21. If carriage 28 in Fig. 8 is shifted towards the right, then the right squeezing system 21 is activated and the left squeezing system 20 is opened. At the right squeezing system 21 the movable squeezing jaws 27 are moved towards the right to the stationary squeezing jaws 25 and the tube R placed between the squeezing jaws 25, 27 is locally pressed flat and is partitioned into cushion-shaped hollow bodies. Together with the carriage 28 the central or middle cover-part 31 is moved towards the right. Thereby the entrance slit of the squeezing system 21 arranged at the right side of the center cover-part 32 is closed and the entrance slit of the left squeezing system 20 arranged on the left side of the central cover-part 32 is opened. Simultaneously, at the left squeezing system 20 the movable squeezing jaws 26 are moved towards the right and away from the stationary squeezing jaws 24.<br>
With the squeezing device 19, compared to the one in Fig. 1-3, approximately double the amount of time is available to achieve a permanent connection between the adjoining walls of the tubes on the areas of the tube flat pressed by the squeezing tools assuming the same through put of tubes.<br>
Figures 10-12 show a device, in which tubes R which can be shaped by kneading are conveyed in longitudinal direction to a squeezing device 33 where they are processed alternately in two length-wise stretched-out, adjacent lying squeezing systems 34, 35. The tubes R are cut in the squeezing systems 34, 35 transverse to their longitudinal direction and are divided into cushion-shaped hollow bodies 36, which fall downwards out from of the respective squeezing system 34, 35.<br><br>
The tubes R are brought to the squeezing device 33 through a feed device 37 extending itself in longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 34,35 and from there to the processing area of the squeezing device 33, where the two squeezing systems 34, 35 are arranged adjacently transverse to their longitudinal direction. The feeding equipment foresees an inclined slide 38 and a downstream drop-shaft 39. The slide 38 is arranged upstream of the squeezing device 33. The drop-shaft is arranged above the working area of the squeezing device 33. The tubes glide or slide in longitudinal direction on the slide 38 into the drop-shaft 39, in which they are conveyed to the squeezing systems 34, 35 transverse to their longitudinal direction.<br>
The squeezing device 33 is placed in a box-shaped frame 40, which limits on the sides the working area of the squeezing device 33 with two carriers/beams 41, 42 running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 34, 35, the two squeezing systems 34, 35 are arranged adjacently transverse to their longitudinal direction. The beams 41, 42 are connected to the front wall 43 and the back wall 44 of the frame 40. They form respectively the outer border of the immediate neighboring squeezing system 34, 35. The squeezing systems 34, 35 are alternately activated by a carriage 45 capable of moving up and down in the frame 40 transverse to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 34, 35.<br>
The squeezing systems 34, 35 have working areas running parallel to each other with squeezing tools arranged in longitudinal direction successively. The squeezing tools have vertically aligned squeezing jaws opposite to each other. On the outer borders/edges of the squeezing systems 34, 35 stationary squeezing jaws aligned inwards are provided, and the movable squeezing jaws inside the squeezing device 33 and aligned to the outer are located opposite to them. The outer squeezing jaws are formed by the stretched-out, outer tool-bars 46, 47, which are fastened to the beams/carriers 41, 42 of the frame 40 forming the outer border of each of the squeezing systems 34, 35. The inner squeezing jaws are formed by the long stretched-out, inner tool-bars 48, 49, which are anchored/fixed facing opposite each other at a middle supporting beam/bracket 50 of the carriage 45. This supporting beam 50 runs parallel to the longitudinal direction of both squeezing systems 34, 35 in the inside of the squeezing device 33.<br>
The carriage 45 has two side supporting beams 51, 52, which are, in the context of Fig. 10, arranged at the left and right of the working area of the squeezing device 33. The central supporting beam 50 and both sidewards supporting beams 51, 52 are connected to each other<br><br>
through longitudinal beams 53, 54, which are neighboring the front wall 43 and the back wall 44 outside of the frame 40. In each the front wall 43 and the back wall 44 of the frame 40 lengthwise stretched-out passage-openings 55 for the supporting beams 50, 51, 52 respectively are provided in the moving direction of the carriage 45.<br>
The carriage 45 is alternately moved up and down in the frame 40 by the moving organs 56, 57 gripping at the supporting beams 51, 52 on the sides of the carriage. The moving organ gripping on the left, side supporting beam 51 supports itself in the frame 40 on the left side end-wall 58. The moving organ 57 gripping on the right, side supporting beam 51, supports itself in the frame 40 on the right, side end-wall 59.<br>
At the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45 a long stretched -out covering hood 60 is attached. The covering hood 60 covers the inner tool bars 48, 49 of both the squeezing systems 34, 35. The covering hood 60 extends till the upper side of the drop-shaft 39 and divides this into partial shafts 39a, 39b assigned to each of the squeezing system 34, 35. The upper side of the covering hood 60 is slanted or chamfered towards to the partial shafts 39a, 39b.<br>
The carriage 45 carries vertical body plates 61,61 running parallel to the covering hood 60. These plates 61, 62 border the partial shafts 39a, 39b at their outer side. The plates 61, 62 are fastened to bars 63, 64 firmly jointed with the longitudinal beams 53, 54 of the carriage 45 running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 34, 35.<br>
The carriage 45 carries located at its longitudinal beams 53, 54 guide devices 65, 66 for the ends of the tubes R and allocated to the face side of the partial shafts 39a, 39b. The guide devices 65, 66 are arranged at the front/face sides of the squeezing systems 34, 35. Each guide device 65, 66 provides an endless belt 67. This is lead around the longitudinal beams 53, 54 of the carriage 45 carrying the guide device 65, 66. The belt is assigned with a belt drive 68 and a belt clamping device 69. Belt drive 68 and belt clamping device 69 are mounted on the external side of the longitudinal beams 53, 54. The belt can also be provided with a belt cleansing equipment attached to the external side of the longitudinal beam 53, 54. The belt 67 on the inner side of the longitudinal beams 53, 54 is lead through a deflecting or steering roll, parallel to the longitudinal beams 53, 54 and which neighbors the face side ends of the inner tool bars 48, 49 of the squeezing systems 34, 34 and is located on the central beam 50 of the carriage 45.<br><br>
Under the frame 40 a circulating conveyer belt is visualized, which captures and further conveys the hollow bodies 36 falling from the squeezing systems 34, 35 removing them.<br>
Fig. 10 and 11 show the squeezing device 33 with a carriage 45 shifted to the right. In this state of the squeezing device 33, the inner tool bars 48, 49 of the two squeezing systems 34, 35 and the covering hood 60 together with the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45 located in the drop-shaft 39 are shifted towards the right in the working area of the squeezing device 33. The left squeezing system 34 is open. The right squeezing system 35 is closed. The left partial shaft 39a is aligned/oriented towards the slide 38. The right partial shaft 39b is blocked by the covering hood 60.<br>
The tube R lead to the slide 38 is diverted by the covering hood 60 to the left partial shaft 39a and falls into the left squeezing system 34, where it is caught by two lower supporting beams 71, 72 and with the activation of the squeezing system 34 is fragmented into cushion-shaped hollow bodies 36, which then fall downwards on the conveyer belt 70.<br>
In order to activate the left squeezing system 34, the moving organs 57 gripping the right supporting beam 52 of the carriage 45, are activated and the carriage 45 is moved towards the left in the Fig. 10 and 11. Thereby the inner tool bars 48, 49 of both squeezing systems 34, 35 and the covering hood 60 together with the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45 located in the drop-shaft 39 are moved to the left in the working area of the squeezing device 33. In the left squeezing system 34 the tube R lying on the lower supporting beams 71, 72 is moved to the left by the inner tool bar 48 anchored to the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45, and is pushed towards outer tool bar 46 located at the at the left border of the squeezing system 34 and fastened to the beam 41 of the frame 40. At the right squeezing system 35 the inner tool bar 49 is pushed away to the left by the outer tool bar 47provided at the right border of the squeezing system 35and attached to the beam 42 of the frame 40. In the drop-shaft 39, the covering hood 60 is pushed to the left.<br>
After activating the left squeezing system 34 the right partial shaft 39b is aligned/oriented towards the slide 38 and the covering hood 60 blocks the left partial shaft 39a.<br>
The tube R conveyed subsequently via the slide 38 is diverted by the covering hood 60 into the right partial shaft 39b and falls into the open, right squeezing system 35, where it is caught by two<br><br>
lower supporting beams. With the operation of the squeezing system 35 the tube is fragmented into cushion-shaped hollow bodies 36, and falls downwards on to the conveyer belt 70.<br>
In order to activate the right squeezing system 35 the moving organs 56 gripping the left supporting beam 51 of the carriage 45 are actuated and the carriage 45 is pushed to the right into in the Fig. 10 and 11 as shown in position. Thereby the inner toolbars 48, 49 of both squeezing systems 34, 35 and the covering hood 60 together with the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45 located in the drop-shaft 39 are moved to right in the working area of the squeezing device 33. In the right squeezing system 35 the tube R lying on the lower supporting beams is pushed towards the right inner tool bar 49 anchored to the central supporting beam 50 of the carriage 45, and is pushed towards the outer tool bar 47 located at the right border of the squeezing system 35 and fastened to the beam 42 of the frame 40. At the left squeezing system 34 the inner tool bar 48 is pushed away to the right by the outer toolbar 46 provided at the left border of the squeezing system 34 arranged at the beam 41 of the frame 40. In the drop-shaft 39 the covering hood 60 is pushed to the right side.<br>
After activating the right squeezing system 35 the left partial shaft 39a is again oriented/aligned towards the slide 38 and the covering hood 60 blocks again the right partial shaft 39b.<br>
The tool bars 46, 47, 48, 49 of the two squeezing systems 34, 35 carry squeezing jaws with straight/linear, vertically aligned squeezing edges. They can be exchanged against toolbars with different squeezing edges or against toolbars with differently aligned squeezing edges in order to produce cushion-shaped hollow bodies with different end edges. For this, no other modifications in the squeezing device 33 other than the exchange of the tool bars of the squeezing systems 34, 35, are necessary.<br>
Fig. 13 and 14 show a further device, in which tubes R, which can be shaped by kneading, are conveyed in longitudinal direction to a squeezing device 73 and are processed there in two stretched-out, adjacently lying squeezing systems 74, 75. In the squeezing systems 74, 75 the tubes R are cut transverse to their longitudinal direction and partitioned in cushion-shaped hollow bodies. The squeezing systems 74, 75 are alternately activated by carriage 67 moving transverse to their longitudinal direction. The squeezing device 73 corresponds to a large extent to the squeezing device 33 of Fig. 10-12.<br><br>
In the squeezing device 73 the working area together with the drop-shaft 77 lies between two beams 78, 79 of the frame 80 running in longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75. These beams 78, 79 are arranged to the right of the frame 80. They carry on their face sides, the external toolbars 81, 82 of the two squeezing systems 74, 75.<br>
The inner tool bars 83, 84 of the squeezing systems 74, 75 are arranged back to back in the inside of the working area of the squeezing device 73.<br>
The inner tool bars 83, 84 are carried by a supporting beam 85 of the carriage 67 parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75. This supporting beam 85 is arranged in the right half of the carriage 76. The carriage 76 has two supporting beams 86, 87 located in its left half tightly adjoining each other and parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75 on which the working cylinder, which pushes the carriage 76 in fig 13 and 14 to the left and right, grips.<br>
The supporting beams 85, 83, 87 of the carriage 76 cross through the front wall 88 and the back wall 89 of the frame 80. They are part of the carriage's supporting frame and are connected to each other outside of the frame 80 by supporting beams 90, 91 of the carriage 67 running transverse to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75.<br>
Both the left supporting beams 86, 87 of carriage 76 are arranged in the frame 80 between a right transverse wall 78a and a left end-wall 92 in neighborhood of beam 78. On the left side of the right frame transverse wall 78a two hydraulic working cylinders 93 are mounted, which push the carriage to the left into the position shown in fig 13 and 14. These working cylinders 93 grip with their working pistons 93a at the right side of the first, left supporting beam 86 of the carriage 76. On the right side of the left frame end wall 92 two hydraulic working cylinder 95 are mounted, which move the carriage away from its position shown in fig 13 and 14 towards the right side. The working cylinders 95 grip with their working pistons 95a at the left side of the second, left supporting beam 87 of the carriage 76.<br>
In the working area of the squeezing device 73 above the two inner tool bars 83, 84 of the squeezing systems 74, 75 a covering hood 96 with a convex or gable-shaped upper side is provided. The covering hood 96 is designed as a single piece with two toolbars 83, 84. The toolbars 83, 84 and the covering hood form a length-wise stretched-out block, which sit astride<br><br>
on the right supporting beam 85 of the carriage 76 parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75. This block divides the drop-shaft 77 into two partial shafts. On the two longitudinal sides of the block running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems 74, 75 successive squeezing jaws of the two inner tool bars 83, 84 are arranged running in longitudinal direction. For cleansing purposes or in order to exchange the inner tool bars 83, 84 the block needs only to be removed from the right supporting beam 85 of the carriage 76. The cleansed block or a block with different toolbar is put on the supporting beam 85 of the carriage 76.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a further device to process tubes R into cushion-shaped hollow bodies. The tubes are conveyed to a squeezing device 96 in longitudinal direction, which has four stretched-out squeezing systems 97, 98, 99, 100, in which the tubes are cut through and are fragmented into cushion-shaped hollow bodies respectively crosswise to their longitudinal direction. The squeezing device 96 has two adjacent areas 101, 102 with a small interval, which are arranged in sections of the squeezing device 96 designed as mirror image of each other. In each working section 101 and/or 102 two long stretched-out squeezing systems 97, 98 and/or 99, 100 are arranged adjacently crosswise to their longitudinal direction. Each working area 101 and 102 is assigned to a carriage 103 and/or 104 capable of moving crosswise to the longitudinal direction of the squeezing systems, which alternately activates the two squeezing systems 97, 98 and/or 99, 100 of the respective working area 101 and/or 102. The left section of the squeezing device 96 corresponds to the squeezing device of Fig. 13 and 14. The right section of the squeezing device 96 is designed as its mirror image. The carriages 103, 104 of the two working areas 101, 102 move independent of each other. The two carriages 103, 104 can also be replaced by one single carriage, which then activates respectively the left squeezing systems 97, 99 of the two working areas 101, 102 and the right squeezing systems 89, 100 of the two working areas 101, 102 simultaneously.<br>

On the tool bar 108 the squeezing jaws are arranged in the center and at the two ends of the tool bar 108. In a squeezing system with this tool holder, each tube is pressed with one side against the flat tool bar 109, closed at both ends closed through a squeezing edge and in the center first locally pressed flat and then fragmented at the flat pressed area, such that two cushion-shaped hollow bodies are obtained.<br>
Fig. 20 shows a further tool holder with two similarly designed tool bars 110, 111. In both tool bars 110, 111 there is a perpendicular squeezing jaw each projecting at the two endings and in the enter. In a squeezing system provided with this tool holder, each tube is fragmented into two hollow bodies which are respectively closed at the ends by squeezing edges.<br>
