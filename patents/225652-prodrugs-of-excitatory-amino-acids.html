				<td>Prodrugs of Excitatory Amino Acids<br>
This invention relates to synthetic excitatory amino<br>
acid prodrugs (and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts)<br>
and processes for their preparation. The invention further<br>
relates to methods of using, and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising, the compounds for the treatment of neurological<br>
disorders and psychiatric disorders.<br>
Treatment of neurological or psychiatric<br>
disorders, such as anxiety disorder, have been linked to<br>
selective activation of metabotropic excitatory amino acid<br>
receptors such as (+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-<br>
dicarboxylic acid, also known as LY354740, which is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,750,566 (the '566 patent)<br>
issued May 12, 1998 is an active MGLUR2 receptor agonist,<br>
CNS Drug Reviews, 5, pgs. 1-12 (1999).<br>
The present invention provides for a prodrug form of<br>
LY354740, which enhances the in vivo potency of LY354740,<br>
producing higher oral exposure of the parent compound. In<br>
addition, when compounds of the present invention are<br>
administered, no circulating level of prodrug was detected<br>
with high in vitro bioconversion to the parent molecule.<br>
Further, the peptide prodrugs are stable under all ranges of<br>
pH and are nontoxic. Compounds of the present invention<br>
represent the best approach for maintaining LY354740-like<br>
safety and efficacy in humans with increased oral<br>
bioavailability. Preclinical studies with, (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-<br>
[(2'S)-(2'-Amino)-propionyl]amino-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-<br>
dicarboxylic acid hydrochloride, the compound of the present<br>
invention, has shown greatly enhanced oral potency in the<br>
treatment of anxiety without the attendant problems of<br>
toxicity, instability at desired pH ranges and low in vivo<br>
conversion.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound<br>
of formula I<br>
wherein<br>
R13, R14 and R17 are hydrogen;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Compounds of the invention have been found to be useful<br>
prodrugs for LY354740 a selective agonist of metabotropic<br>
glutamate receptors and are therefore useful in the<br>
pharmaceutical treatment of diseases of the central nervous<br>
system such as neurological diseases, for example<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, and as antipsychotic,<br>
anxiolytic, drug-withdrawal, antidepressant, anticonvulsant,<br>
analgesic and anti-emetic agents.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula<br>
(I) contain at least four asymmetric carbon atoms, three<br>
being in the cyclopropane ring and one being at the a-carbon<br>
of the amino acid group. Accordingly, the compounds of the<br>
invention may exist in and be isolated in enantiotnerically<br>
pure form, in racemic form, or in a diastereoisomeric<br>
mixture.<br>
The amino acid moiety preferably has the natural amino<br>
acid configuration, i.e. the L-configuration relative to D-<br>
glycerol aldehyde.<br>
The present invention includes pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the compound of formula I. These salts<br>
can exist in conjunction with the acidic or basic portion of<br>
the molecule and can exist as acid addition, primary,<br>
secondary, tertiary, or quaternary ammonium, alkali metal,<br>
or alkaline earth metal salts. Generally, the acid addition<br>
salts are prepared by the reaction of an acid with a<br>
compound of formula I. The alkali metal and alkaline earth<br>
metal salts are generally prepared by the reaction of the<br>
hydroxide form of the desired metal salt with a compound of<br>
formula I.<br>
Some particular salts provide certain formulation<br>
advantages due to their crystalline form. Non-crystalline<br>
forms of compounds may be amorphous and hygroscopic.<br>
Crystalline forms of pharmaceutical compounds are sometimes<br>
more desirable because they are not amorphous..<br>
A particular pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the<br>
peptide of formula I is (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-[(2'5)-(2'-Amino)-<br>
propionyl] amino-bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane-2, 6-dicarboxylic acid<br>
hydrochloride salt.<br>
Another particular pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
the peptide of formula I is (1S, 2S, SR, 6S) -2- [(2' S) - (2'-<br>
Amino) -propionyl] amino-bicyclo [3.1. 0] hexane-2, 6-dicarboxylic<br>
acid methane sulfonate salt.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form such salts include<br>
inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>
nitric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids, or with organic<br>
acids, such as organic carboxylic acids, for example,<br>
glycollic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric,<br>
citric, salicyclic, o-acetoxybenzoic, or organic sulphonic,<br>
2-hydroxyethane sulphonic, toluene-p-sulphonic, methane-<br>
sulfonic or naphthalene-2-sulphonic acid.<br>
In addition to pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, other<br>
salts are included in the invention. They may serve as<br>
intermediates in the purification of compounds or in the<br>
preparation of other, for example pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable, acid addition salts, or are useful for<br>
identification, characterization or purification.<br>
A variety of physiological functions have been shown to<br>
be subject to influence by excessive or inappropriate<br>
stimulation of excitatory amino acid transmission. The<br>
formula I compounds of the present invention are believed to<br>
have the ability to treat a variety of neurological<br>
disorders in mammals associated with this condition,<br>
including acute neurological disorder such as cerebral<br>
deficits subsequent to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting,<br>
stroke, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma,<br>
perinatal hypoxia, cardiac arrest, and hypoglycemic neuronal<br>
damage. The formula I compounds are believed to have the<br>
ability to treat a variety of chronic neurological<br>
disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's Chorea,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AIDS-induced dementia, ocular<br>
damage and retinopathy, cognitive disorders, and idiopathic<br>
and drug-induced Parkinson's. The present invention also<br>
provides methods fcr treating these disorders which<br>
comprises administering to a patient in need thereof an<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula I or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The formula I compounds of the present invention treat<br>
a variety of other neurological disorders in patients that<br>
are associated with glutamate dysfunction, including<br>
muscular spasms, convulsions, migraine headaches, urinary<br>
incontinence, pain, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD),<br>
psychosis, (such as schizophrenia), drug tolerance and<br>
withdrawal (such as nicotine, opiates and benzodiazepines) ,<br>
anxiety and related disorders, emesis, brain edema, chronic<br>
pain, and tardive dyskinesia. The formula I compounds are<br>
also useful as antidepressant and analgesic agents.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also provides methods for<br>
treating these disorders which comprise administering to a<br>
patient in need thereof an effective amount of the compound<br>
of formula I,- or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A compound of Formula I may be made by a process which<br>
is analogous to one known in the chemical art for the<br>
production of structurally analogous heterocyclic compounds<br>
or by a novel process described herein. Such processes and<br>
intermediates useful for the manufacture of a compound of<br>
Formula I as defined above are provided as further features<br>
of the invention and are illustrated by the following<br>
procedures in which, unless otherwise specified, the<br>
meanings of the generic radicals are as defined above.<br>

The term "nitrogen protecting group," as used herein,<br>
refers to those groups intended to protect or block the<br>
nitrogen group against undesirable reactions during<br>
synthetic procedures. Choice of the suitable nitrogen<br>
protecting group used will depend upon the conditions that<br>

Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991)) .<br>
The term "carboxy-protecting group" as used herein<br>
refers to one of the ester derivatives of the carboxylic<br>
acid group commonly employed to block or protect the<br>
carboxylic acid group while reactions are carried out on<br>
other functional groups of the compound. Particular values<br>
include, for example, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, benzyl,<br>
methoxymethyl, trimethylsilyl, and the like. Further<br>
examples of such groups" may be found in T.W. Greene and<br>
P.G.M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in. Organic Synthesis, 3rd.<br>
Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1999)).. The ester is<br>
decomposed by using a conventional procedure which does not<br>
affect another portion of the molecule.<br>
Whereafter, for any of the above procedures, when a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula I<br>
is required, it is obtained by reacting the acid of Formula<br>
I with a physiologically acceptable base or by reacting a<br>
basic compound of Formula I with a physiologically<br>
acceptable acid or by any other conventional procedure.<br>

As used herein the term "effective amount" refers<br>
to the amount or dose of the compound, upon single or<br>
multiple dose administration to the patient, which<br>
provides the desired effect in the patient under<br>
diagnosis or treatment.<br>
An effective amount can be readily determined by<br>
the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art,<br>
by the use of known techniques and by observing results<br>
obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining<br>
the effective amount or dose of compound administered,<br>
a number of factors are considered by the attending<br>
diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the<br>
species of mammal; its size, age, and general health;<br>
the specific disease involved; the degree of or<br>
involvement or the severity of the disease; the<br>
response of the individual patient; the particular<br>
compound administered; the mode of administration; the<br>
bioavailability characteristics of the preparation<br>
administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of<br>
concomitant medication; and other relevant<br>
circumstances. For example, a typical daily dose may<br>
contain from about 25 mg to about 300 mg of the active<br>
ingredient. The compounds can be administered by a<br>
variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, bucal or<br>
intranasal routes. Alternatively, the compound may be<br>
administered by continuous infusion.<br>
As used herein the term "patient" refers to a<br>
mammal, such as a mouse, guinea pig, rat, dog or human.<br>
It is understood that the preferred patient is a human.<br>
The term "treating" (or "treat") as used herein<br>
includes its generally accepted meaning which<br>
encompasses prohibiting, preventing, restraining, and<br>
slowing, stopping, or reversing progression of a<br>
resultant symptom. As such, the methods of this<br>
invention encompass both therapeutic and prophylactic<br>
administration.<br>
If not commercially available, the necessary starting<br>
materials for the above procedures may be made by procedures<br>
which are selected from standard techniques of organic and<br>
heterocyclic chemistry, techniques which analogous to the<br>
syntheses of known, structurally similar compounds, and the<br>
procedures described in the Examples, including novel<br>
procedures.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides for<br>
a method of administering an effective amount of a compound<br>
of formula II, where R13 and R14 are both hydrogen (a di-<br>
acid), which comprises administering to a patient requiring<br>
modulated excitatory amino acid neurotransmission a<br>
phartnaceutically-effective amount of a compound of formula<br>
I.<br>
Compounds of formula I are converted via enzymatic or<br>
hydrolytic process in vivo, to form compounds of formula II,<br>
where R13 and R14 are both hydrogen (a di-acid), as shown in<br>
Scheme 1 below.<br>
Scheme 1: In Vivo Conversion<br>
In particular, a crystalline form of a compound of<br>
formula I may be prepared according to the route outlined in<br>
Scheme 2 below in which each of R13 and R14, respectively,<br>
represents a value defined for the groups R13 and R14. The<br>
process described in Scheme 2 is a synthesis method for the<br>
preparation of a crystalline hydrochloride salt form of a<br>
compound of formula I and a methanesulfonate salt form of a<br>
compound of formula I.<br>
Scheme 2: Process for Preparation of Particular Salt<br>
In scheme 2 above, the monohydrate of II, where R13 and<br>
R14 are both hydrogen (a di-acid), is treated with thionyl<br>
chloride and methanol affording the corresponding di-ester<br>
of II. Alternatively, catalytic hydrochloric acid may be<br>
used in place of thionylchloride. The di-ester, formula II,<br>
is amidated with a compound of formula III using<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) , 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI) or isobutyl chloroformate as a<br>
coupling agent to afford a di-ester protected peptidyl<br>
compound of formula I. This transformation could also be<br>
achieved using the acid chloride or by using a variety of<br>
other peptide coupling reagents, for example, diphenyl<br>
chlorophosphate and 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine<br>
(CDMT), bis{2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride and<br>
benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate.<br>
The hydrolysis of the di-ester protected peptidyl<br>
compound of formula I with a suitable base such as lithium<br>
hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in THF affords the di-acid<br>
protected peptidyl compound of formula I, where R13 and R14<br>
are both hydrogen (a di-acid). The di-acid protected<br>
peptidyl compound of formula I may be deprotected with a<br>
mineral or organic acid in a suitable solvent. Such<br>
conditions may produce the corresponding acid salt of the<br>
di-acid peptidyl compound of formula I as an amorphous solid<br>
or, directly, a crystalline solid. In the case of an<br>
amorphous solid, subsequent crystallization may occur from<br>
suitable solvents. For example, a di-acid protected<br>
peptidyl compound of formula I when treated hydrogen<br>
chloride gas in ethyl acetate provides the deprotected<br>
hydrochloride salt as an amorphous solid. The amorphous<br>
hydrochloride compound may then be crystallized from acetone<br>
and water to afford the crystalline hydrochloride salt<br>
compound of formula I. In the case of a crystalline solid<br>
which is formed directly, filtration of the reaction mixture<br>
may afford the crystalline salt. The zwitterionic compound<br>
of formula I is afforded by treatment of the crystalline<br>
hydrochloride salt of formula I with sodium hydroxide. It<br>
will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that<br>
a compound of formula I may be prepared in one procedure<br>
where the indicated intermediates are not isolated.<br>
The ability of compounds to modulate metabotropic<br>
glutamate receptor function may be demonstrated by examining<br>
their ability to influence either cAMP production (mGluR 2,<br>
3, 4, 6, 7 or 8) or phosphoinositide hydrolysis (mGluR 1 or<br>
5) in cells expressing these individual human metabotropic<br>
glutamate receptor {mGluR) subtypes. (D. D. Schoepp, et<br>
al., Neuropharmacol., 1996, 35, 1661-1672 and 1997, 36, 1-<br>
11).<br>
The ability of formula I compounds to treat anxiety or<br>
a related disorder may be demonstrated using the well known<br>
fear potentiated startle and elevated plus maze models of<br>
anxiety described respectively in Davis, Psyche-pharmacology,<br>
62:1;1979 and Lister, Psychopharmacol, 92:180-185; 1987<br>
In Vitro Receptor Binding<br>
To study the ability to affect receptor binding of<br>
compounds of the present invention in comparison to<br>
LY354740, displacement of a high affinity mGluR2 antagonist<br>
radioligand [3H] LY341495 to cell membranes from human<br>
mGluR2, human mGluR3, and native rat brain tissues was<br>
determined. (See, Ornstein P. L., Arnold M. B., Bleisch T.<br>

As shown in Table 1 below, LY354740 displaced<br>
[3H]LY341495 binding to rat forebrain membranes with a<br>
potency similar to that observed in human recombinant<br>
receptors. In contrast, the compound of formula I did not<br>
appreciably displace [3H]LY341495 binding to rat forebrain<br>
membranes at up to 10,000 nM.<br>
In Vivo Actions in Rat Fear Potentiated Startle Anxiety<br>
Model<br>
To study the oral potencies of compounds of the present<br>
invention in comparison to LY35474 0 in an mGlu2/3 receptor<br>
linked therapeutic animal model, studies in the rat fear-<br>
potentiated startle assay were performed. This model was<br>
specifically chosen, as it is highly sensitive to tnGlu2/3<br>
agonists such as LY35474 0 and compounds of the present<br>
invention. (See, Helton D.R., Tizzano J.P., Monn J.A.,<br>
Schoepp D.D., and Kallman M.J., Anxiolytic and side-effect<br>
profile of LY354740: A potent, high selective, orally active<br>
agonist for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 284: 651-660 (1998)). To verify that<br>
the actions of a cqmpound of formula I in this model were<br>
mGlu2/3 receptor mediated, as has been shown previously for<br>
LY354740 (See, Tizaano, J.P., Griffey K.I., Ornstein P.L.,<br>
Monn J.A., and Schoepp D.D., Actions of mGlu receptor<br>
agonists on fear-conditioning versus fear-expression in<br>
rats, Neuropharmacology, 38:A45 (#144) (1999)), the ability<br>
of LY341495 (an raGlu2/3 receptor antagonist) (See, Kingston<br>
A.E., Ornstein P.L., Wright R.A., Johnson B.G., Mayne N.G.,<br>
Burnett J.P., Belagaje R., Wu S., and Schoepp D.D., LY341495<br>
is a nanomolar potent and selective antagonist for group II<br>
metabotropic glutamate receptors, Neuropharmacology, 37: 1-<br>
12 (1998)) to block compound-mediated suppression of fear-<br>
potentiated startle was also determined. As a positive<br>
control in each experiment, diazepam (0.6 mg/kg i.p.) was<br>
used. All experiments were performed in fed rats.<br>
In the fear potentiated startle model, animals are<br>
exposed to a neutral stimulus such as light (conditioned<br>
stimulus) with an aversive stimulus such as a shock<br>
(unconditioned stimulus). Following conditioning, when the<br>
animals are presented with a loud acoustic stimulus, larger<br>
startle responses are elicited when the startle stimulus is<br>
preceded by light.<br>
Diazepam and buspirone hydrochloride, which are<br>
clinically proven anxiolytics, are effective at reducing the<br>
fear (increased startle response) associated with the<br>
presentation of light in the fear potentiated startle model,<br>
and in reducing the fear of open spaces in the elevated plus<br>
maze model.<br>
Male Long Evans rats (180-400 g) or male NIH Swiss<br>
mice (18-35 g) were obtained from Harlan Sprague-<br>
Dawley, Cumberland, IN, USA and acclimated at least 3<br>
days before testing. Animals were housed at<br>
23+2°C(relative humidity 30% to 70%) and given Purina<br>
Certified Rodent Chow and water ad libitum. The<br>
photoperiod was 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark,<br>
with dark onset at approximately 1800 hours.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in a vehicle of<br>
purified water and neutralized with 5 N NaOH to a pH of<br>
7-8 when applicable. Diazepam (Sigma Chemical Company,<br>
St. Louis, MO) was suspended in purified water by the<br>
dropwise addition of Tween 80. Control animals<br>
received the respective vehicle.<br>
SL-LAB (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA)<br>
chambers were used for conditioning sessions and for<br>
the production and recording of startle responses. A<br>
classical conditioning procedure was used to produce<br>
potentiation of startle responses. Briefly, on the<br>
first 2 days, rats were placed into dark startle<br>
chambers in which shock grids were installed.<br>
Following a 5-minute acclimation period, each rat<br>
received a 1mA electric shock (500ms) preceded by a 5<br>
second presentation of light (15 watt) which remained<br>
on for the duration of the shock. Ten presentations of<br>
the light and shock were given in each conditioning<br>
session, rats were gavaged with a solution of test<br>
compound of water and startle testing sessions were<br>
conducted. A block of 10 consecutive presentations of<br>
acoustic startle stimuli (110 dB, non-light-paired)<br>
were presented at the beginning of the session in order<br>
to minimize the influences of the initial rapid phase<br>
of habituation to the stimulus. This was followed by<br>
20 alternating trials of the noise alone or noise<br>
preceded by the light. Excluding the initial trial<br>
block, startle response amplitudes for each trial type<br>
(noise-alone vs. light+noise) were averaged for each<br>
rat across the entire test session.<br>
As shown in the first row of Table 2, below, when given<br>
orally to fed rats, compounds of the present invention were<br>
active in the rat fear-potentiated startle test at 300 times<br>
lower doses when compared to LY354740. If this in vivo<br>
animal model data directly predicts human anxiety responses,<br>
compounds of the present invention would produce anxiolytic<br>
effects in humans at 300 fold lower doses than the parent<br>
compound. Furthermore, the ability to produce a longer<br>
duration at lower doses when compared to parent may allow<br>
for once-a day dosing, as opposed to twice a day dosing.<br>
In Vivo Exposure as Measured by Rat Plasma Concentration<br>
To study the in vivo exposure of LY354740 following<br>
oral dosing of compounds of the present invention in<br>
comparison to LY354740, studies measuring the plasma<br>
concentrations of LY354740 in rats were performed.<br>
Mature Fischer 344 male rats (190-270 gram) were<br>
obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Cumberland, IN, USA<br>
and acclimated in the study housing for 3 days. On day 4,<br>
test compounds were dissolved in buffered water (1mg/ml =<br>
test compound/20mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH=2) and<br>
given orally as a single 5mg/kg dose. Blood samples were<br>
collected through orbital sinus or cardiac puncture (last<br>
time point) at 0.5 and 1 hour or, alternatively, 1 and 3<br>
hours. Plasma samples were stored at -20°C in the presence<br>
of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor,<br>
prior to analysis. Plasma samples and internal standard<br>
compounds were pretreated by solid phase extraction (SAX<br>
support, methanol/water/dilute acetic acid). As shown in<br>
the second row of Table 2, below, the plasma concentrations<br>
(ng/ml) of LY354740 for each test compound were determined<br>
by LC/MS/MS and are presented as a sum of the concentrations<br>
at the 0.5 and 1 hour or, alternatively, 1 and 3 hour sample time points.<br>
As shown above in Tables 1 and 2, in vitro studies show<br>
that the compounds of the present invention had no<br>
appreciable affinity per se for mGlu2/3 receptors. This<br>
indicates that the in vivo pharmacology of this compound in<br>
rats and humans would likely reflect the conversion of the<br>
prodrug to the parent molecule, LY354740, which then acts at<br>
mGlu2/3 receptors to produce a therapeutic effect. Further,<br>
in fact, when given orally to rats, the compounds of the<br>
current invention exhibit a 15 fold increase in plasma<br>
concentration of LY354740 when compared to LY354740. This<br>
demonstrates compounds of the present invention are<br>
converted to LY35474 0 in vivo.<br>

hydrochloride<br>
Thionyl chloride (807 mL, 11.1 mol) was added to methanol<br>
(9.5 L) over a period of 1 h while maintaining the<br>
temperature between 2-20 °C. The solution was maintained<br>
for 30 min, then (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-amino-bicyclo[3.l.0]hexane-<br>
2,6-dicarboxylic acid monohydrate (1.61 kg, 7.92 mol) was<br>
added. The resulting solution was heated to 47 °C and<br>
maintained between 47 - 50 DC for 17 h. Approximately 7.3 L<br>
of methanol was then removed by vacuum distillation (47 - 50<br>
°C, 240 - 275 mm Hg). The remaining methanol was removed by<br>
azeotropic distillation with t-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) at<br>
atmospheric pressure [added MTBE (10 L), removed 8.5 L;<br>
added MTBE (10 L), removed 8-5 L; added MTBE (8 L), removed<br>

(1S, 2S, 5R, 6S) -2-Amino-bicyclo [3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic<br>
acid dimethyl ester hydrochloride with N-BOC-(L)-aminoacids.<br>
The starting dimethyl ester hydrochloride salt (1.0 equiv),<br>
the product of Example Preparation 2, was suspended in dry<br>
dichloromethane (0.1 M solution) under nitrogen. The<br>
corresponding N-BOC-aminoacid (1.5 equiv), N-ethyl-N',N'-<br>
dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC, 1.5 equiv) and 1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt, 1.5 equiv) were added in one<br>
portion, followed by triethyl amine(1.0 equiv) via syringe<br>
and, finally, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.1 equiv). The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature,<br>
then hydrolyzed by addition of IN hydrochloric acid (20 ml /<br>
mmol) and diluted with methylene chloride (10 ml / mmol).<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (5<br>
ml / mmol) and the combined organic layers washed twice with<br>
1 N hydrochloric acid (10 ml / mmol), and finally with water<br>
and brine (10 ml / mmol each). After drying over sodium<br>
sulfate and evaporation under vacuum the crude residue was<br>
purified by silica gel chromatography using the appropriate<br>
eluent (typically mixtures hexanes/ethyl acetate).<br>

rinsed with methylene chloride, and the filtrate was washed<br>
with 0.1 M NaHCO3 followed by 1.0 N hydrochloric acid. The<br>
organic phase was dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated<br>
to afford the title compound as an oil.<br>

bicyclo[3.l.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid tnonohydrate (85<br>
g, 418 mmol) and MeOH (850 mL) was cooled to 10 ºC. Thionyl<br>
chloride (199 g, 1.67 mol) was added at a rate such that the<br>
temperature did not exceed 20 °C. The solution was then<br>
heated to 50 °C and stirred for 6 h. Upon completion of the<br>
reaction, the solution was cooled to room temperature and<br>
concentrated to approximately 170 mL total volume under<br>
reduced pressure at 20 - 30 °C. Water (850 mL) was added,<br>
and the pH of the solution was adjusted to approximately pH<br>
2.0 with 1.0 N NaOH (300 mL). The solution was concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure until the temperature reached<br>
approximately 40 ºC. Methylene chloride (850 mL) was then<br>
added, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 8 with<br>
1.0 N NaOH (180 mL). The phases were separated, and the<br>
aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (425 mL). The<br>
combined organic phases containing the corresponding<br>
dimethyl ester were concentrated to approximately 425 mL<br>
total volume, and held for further processing.<br>
In a separate reaction vessel a solution of N-t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl-L-alanine (83.2 g, 439 mmol) and 4-<br>
methylmorpholine (44.4 g, 439 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (712 mL) was<br>
cooled to -5 - -10 ºC. Isobutyl chloroformate (59.9 g, 439<br>
mmol) was then added at rate such that the temperature did<br>
not exceed -5 ºC. Upon completion of the addition, the<br>
solution was stirred for 15 min. Simultaneously, CH2Cl2 (20<br>
mL) was added to the dimethyl ester solution previously<br>
prepared, and this solution was cooled to -5 °C. The<br>
dimethyl ester solution (445 mL) was then added to the<br>
isobutyl mixed anhydride mixture. The cooling bath was<br>
removed, and the corresponding mixture was stirred for 30<br>
min. A solution of 1.0 N HCl (445 mL) was then added. The<br>
phases were separated, and the organic phase was washed with<br>
1.0 N HCl (445 mL). The organic phase was concentrated to<br>
approximately 180 mL total volume. THF (450 mL) was then<br>
added, and the resulting solution was concentrated to<br>
approximately 180 mL total volume. To this solution was<br>
added 1.0 N NaOH (1.67 L, 1.67 mol). The resulting mixture<br>
was heated to 40 ºC, stirred for 1.5 h then cooled to room<br>
temperature. Ethyl acetate (2.4 L) was added, and the pH of<br>
the aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 2.1 with concentrated<br>
HCl (150 mL). The phases were separated, and the aqueous<br>
phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (800 mL). The<br>
combined organic phases were dried with MgSO4, filtered and<br>
washed with EtOAc (2 x 320 mL). The resulting solution was<br>
then concentrated to approximately 400 mL total volume.<br>
Ethyl acetate (800 mL) was added, and the solution was<br>
concentrated to 400 mL). This ethyl acetate<br>
addition/concentration was repeated again, then heptane (640<br>
mL) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h,<br>
filtered and washed with a 2 : 1 mixture of heptane-ethyl<br>
acetate (2 x 320 mL) to afford 115.5 g (78% yield) of<br>
