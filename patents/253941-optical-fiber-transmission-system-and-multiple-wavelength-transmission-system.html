				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber that suppresses the occurrence of<br>
Simulated Brillouin Scattering (hereinafter referred to as SBS) to allow transmission with<br>
higher-power signals. The present invention also relates to a transmission system and a<br>
wavelength division multiplexing system using this optical fiber.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-308359 filed on<br>
October 22, 2004, Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-55669 filed on March 1, 2005,<br>
and Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-208687 filed on July 19,2005, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Nowadays, a fiber to the home (hereinafter referred to as FTTH) service is<br>
available in which optical fibers are extended to individual homes to be used for<br>
exchange of various information.<br>
As one form of FTTH that transmits various information, there is a system in<br>
which a broadcast signal and another communication signal are simultaneously<br>
transmitted in different systems by means of a single optical fiber (ITU-T<br>
Recommendation G.652). Generally in this system, the broadcast signal is often an<br>
analog signal or a baseband signal.<br>
The characteristics of the system having an optical fiber as a transmission<br>
medium are as follows:<br><br>
-	FTTH is typically a double-star type PON (Passive Optical Network), and has a large<br>
distribution loss (typically, up to 32 branches are assumed).<br>
-	Since FTTH transmits an analog signal or a baseband signal, a CNR (Carrier Noise<br>
Ratio) in the receiver is required to be high, and the required minimum signal light power<br>
in the light receiving portion is larger compared with the case of digital transmission used<br>
for communication.<br>
From the viewpoint described above , in this system, the signal light power in<br>
the signal input portion needs to be large.. Especially in consideration of attenuation and<br>
distribution loss during transmission of a signal light, higher power is required in a line<br>
with a longer distance or more branches. If a signal can be transmitted as far as possible<br>
and distributed to many subscribers at a time, it is more advantageous from various<br>
points of view (construction costs, maintainability, system design, etc.).<br>
However, in an optical transmission using an optical fiber, even if light with<br>
more than a certain power is intended to be injected into an optical fiber, SBS, which is<br>
one type of non-linear phenomenon, allows the entrance of light with a certain amount of<br>
power(hereinafter, referred to as SBS threshold power) or less and the rejected light is<br>
returned to the entrance light side as backscattered light. This phenomenon sometimes<br>
puts restrictions on signal light power in the input portion, thus posing a problem (for<br>
example, see Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
Conventionally, as methods for achieving SBS suppression, techniques for<br>
modifying optical characteristics in the longitudinal direction, the dopant concentrations,<br>
and the residual stress have been reported (see, for example, Patent Document 1 and<br>
Non-Patent Document 2).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereunder is a description of embodiments of the present invention with<br>
reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram showing one embodiment of the optical fiber according to<br>
the present invention. An optical fiber 1 of this embodiment comprises an inner core 2<br>
that is made from silica glass doped with germanium and fluorine, an outer core 3 that is<br>
provided at the outer periphery of the inner core 2 and is made from silica glass doped<br>
with germaniµm, or silica glass that is doped with germanium and fluorine wherein the<br>
dope amount of fluorine is smaller than the dope amount of fluorine in the inner core 2,<br>
and a cladding 4 that is provided at the outer periphery of the outer core 3. This structure<br>
can suppress the occurrence of SBS that is problematic in transmission through optical<br>
fibers, increase the SBS threshold power, and allow transmission with higher-power<br>
signals.<br>
Preferably, the concentration of germanium is in a range between 4% and 15%<br>
by mass in terms of germanium oxide, and the concentration of fluorine is in a range<br>
between 0.2% and 5% by mass, in the inner core 2. If the concentrations of germanium<br>
and fluorine in the inner core 2 are greater than the above ranges, the transmission loss in<br>
the optical fiber 1 is increased due to an increase in the Rayleigh scattering, which may<br>
become problematic in practice. In contrast, the concentrations of germanium and<br><br>
fluorine in the inner core 2 are smaller than the above ranges, the advantage of increasing<br>
SBS threshold power may become smaller, which may hinder achieving the objects of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, it is desired that the ratio of the inner core diameter and the outer<br>
core diameter be in a range between 0.10 and 0.85. By setting the ratio of the inner core<br>
diameter and the outer core diameter within the above range, an SBS threshold power of<br>
about 1.5 times higher than those of typical single-mode optical fibers (hereinafter<br>
referred to as typical SM optical fibers) can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, it is more preferable that the ratio of the inner core diameter and<br>
the outer core diameter be in a range between 0.25 and 0.70. By setting the ratio of the<br>
inner core diameter and the outer core diameter within the above range, it becomes<br>
possible to increase the SBS threshold power about 2 times higher than those of typical<br>
SM optical fibers.<br>
Furthermore, it is desired that the optical refractive indices of the inner core 2<br>
and the outer core 3 be substantially the same. If the optical refractive indices of the<br>
inner core 2 and the outer core 3 are different, the waveguide dispersion (also known as<br>
structure dispersion) in the optical fiber shifts to the longer-wavelength side, which may<br>
make controlling optical characteristics within desired ranges difficult. Here, "optical<br>
refractive indices are substantially the same" assumes that each difference of refractive<br>
indices is about 0.07% or less in terms of relative refractive index difference (Δ).<br>
However, since the inner core 2 and the outer core 3 may have some degree of<br>
unevenness of the refractive indices in the radial direction caused by non-uniformity in<br>
manufacturing. It should be noted that making comparisons among average refractive<br>
indices of the inner core 2 and the outer core 3 is appropriate. It should be also noted<br>
that, here, a "desired range" means a range that satisfies the requirements of ITU-T<br><br>
Recommendation G.652, for example. Among the characteristics defined by G.652, at<br>
least having the comparative chromatic dispersion characteristic is very important when<br>
designing transmission lines. In other cases, it would be suffice that no considerable<br>
deviation from the optical characteristics of existing optical fibers in various types is<br>
introduced by adapting a structure according to the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, in order to obtaining optical characteristics satisfying the<br>
requirements of ITU-T Recommendation G.652, it is required that the average value of<br>
the optical refractive index of the entire core region, including the inner core 2 and the<br>
outer core 3, be in a range between 0.30% and 0.40% as a relative refractive index<br>
difference with respect to the cladding 4, and that the outer core diameter be in a range<br>
between 7.5 µm and 11 µm.<br>
Optical fibers that have the above-described structure of the present invention<br>
and exhibits optical characteristics satisfying the requirements of ITU-T<br>
Recommendation G.652 have an advantages in that they can be used in the same manner<br>
as conventional optical fibers since they have the same optical characteristics as those of<br>
optical fibers constituting existing transmission paths, except for having higher SBS<br>
threshold power.<br>

an inner core 2 that has higher refractive index in the vicinity of the outer periphery than<br>
in the center, an inner core 3 that is provided at the outer periphery of the inner core 2<br>
and has higher refractive index in the vicinity of the outer periphery, and a cladding 4<br>
that is provided at the outer periphery of the outer core 3 and is made from silica glass.<br>
An optical fiber having the refractive index profile shown in FIG. 3E comprises<br>
an inner core 2 that has an approximately indented refractive index profile in which the<br>
refractive index is smaller in the center portion, an outer core 3 that is provided at the<br>
outer periphery of the inner core 2 and has the refractive index profile in which the<br>
refractive index of the outer periphery portion is gradually decreased, and a cladding 4<br>
that is provided at the outer periphery of the outer core 3 and is made from silica glass.<br>
An optical fiber having the refractive index profile shown in FIG. 3F comprises<br>
an inner core 2 having a wedge-shaped low-refractive index portion at the center portion,<br>

2 and is gradually decreased towards the outer periphery, and a cladding 4 that is<br>
provided at the outer periphery of the outer core 3 and is made from silica glass.<br>
The present invention also provides a transmission system using the optical fiber<br>
according to the present invention described above.<br>
An advantage of using the above-described optical fiber of the present invention<br>
is that a signal light with higher power can be introduced. Therefore, performing an<br>
analog transmission or baseband transmission that requires comparatively high power by<br>
used of the optical fiber of the present invention enables a longer-distance transmission<br>
with more branches, and thus great benefits can be obtained. Especially in a system<br>
with a transmission distance of 15 km or longer and/or 32 branches or more, the greatest<br>
benefits can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, by use of the optical fiber according to the present invention,<br>
wavelength division multiplexing can also be performed in which another transmission<br>
can be performed simultaneously with the above-described analog transmission or<br>
baseband transmission. As for wavelength division multiplexing, one form of FTTH<br>
shown in ITU-T G.983.3, CWDM, or the like can be conceived. Especially in a system<br>
with a transmission distance of 15 km or longer and/or 32 branches or more, the greatest<br>
benefits can be obtained.<br>
Obviously, there is no need to limit the optical fiber of the present invention to<br>
these applications in a transmission system. For example, it can be used not only in a<br>
typical public data communication, but also in a digital, long-distance relay-free<br>
transmission system, an intelligent transportation system (ITS), a sensor, a remote laser<br>
cutting system, etc.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
First Embodiment<br>
Optical fibers according to a first embodiment of the present invention were<br>
prototyped. Tables 1-3 show Examples Nos. 2-25 of optical fibers prototyped, together<br>
with their structures and optical characteristics. Furthermore, a typical SM optical fiber<br>
(compliant with ITU-T Recommendation G.652) is also shown in Table 1 in No. 1 as a<br>
comparative example. It should be noted that, in Tables 1-3, "Ge concentration"<br>
indicates concentrations of germanium doped into the inner core or the outer core (in<br>
terms of germanium oxide), and "F concentration" indicates concentrations of fluorine<br>
doped into the inner core or the outer core. Furthermore, as for the optical fiber of each<br>
of Examples Nos. 2-25, "rel. Brillouin gain" shows relative values of the SBS light<br>
intensity measured in the optical fiber of each Example when the value of the SBS light<br>
intensity measured in the optical fiber of the comparative example was taken as 1.<br>
Similarly, "threshold power" shows relative values of the SBS threshold power measured<br>
in the optical fiber of each Example when the value of the SBS threshold power<br>
measured in the optical fiber of the comparative example was taken as 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The results in Tables 1-3 indicate that the occurrence of SBS were reduced and<br>
relatively higher SBS threshold power was obtained in the optical fibers of Examples<br>
Nos. 2-25 compared to the typical SM optical fiber of the comparative example, which<br>
allowed transmission with higher-power signals than in the typical SM optical fiber of<br>
the comparative example. This is because they were configured to have an inner core<br>
containing germanium and fluorine and an outer core containing only germanium or<br>
germanium and a small amount of fluorine.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the relationship among the ratios of inner core diameter/outer core<br>
diameter, the inner core Ge concentrations, and the threshold power obtained in the<br>
optical fibers prototyped in this embodiment.<br>
FIG. 2 indicates that the desired threshold power was obtained when the<br>
above-described parameter range is satisfied,<br>
second embodiment<br><br>
A second embodiment is related to an SM optical fiber that has an MFD at a<br>
wavelength of 1310 nm of about 8.6 µm. Such optical fibers have been commercialized<br>
as optical fibers that reduce bending loss in the range satisfying ITU-T Recommendation<br>
G.652. The concentration profiles of dopants (Ge and F) and the relative refractive<br>
index difference of such an optical fiber that is designed using conventional techniques<br>
are shown in FIGS. 4A-C and Table 4.<br><br>
Such a refractive index profile can provide optical fibers having optical<br>
characteristics described below:<br>
Fiber cut-off: 1.26 µm.<br>
MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm: 8.59 µm.<br>
MFD at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 9.56 µm.<br>
Zero-dispersion wavelength: 1305.8 nm.<br>
Chromatic dispersion at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 17.1 ps/nm/km.<br>
Dispersion slope at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 0.057 ps/nm2/km.<br>
Bending loss at a bending diameter of 30 mm at a wavelength of 1310 nm: 
Bending loss at a bending diameter of 30 mm at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 1.89*10-2<br>
dB/m.<br>
The optical fiber based on the refractive index profile shown in FIGS. 4A-C<br>
improved the bending loss by having an MFD smaller than those of the typical SM<br><br>
optical fiber shown as Example 1 or the comparative example. However, reduction in<br>
the MFD may be problematic since it may deteriorate the SBS threshold power.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the relative Brillouin gain spectrum obtained in the refractive<br>
index profile shown in FIGS. 4A-C. The data was standardized by assuming the<br>
maximum value of the Brillouin gain of the optical fiber of Example 1, the comparative<br>
example, as 1. The maximum relative Brillouin gain became 1.18, and the SBS<br>
threshold power became 0.7 dB smaller.<br>
FIGS. 6A-C and Table 5 show Example 26 of the optical fiber based on a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Compared to the example based on the conventional techniques, the<br>
concentrations of Ge and F in the inner core region were higher. However, the relative<br>
refractive index difference A remained the same, and optical characteristics, such as the<br>
MFD and the chromatic dispersion, were the same as those of the optical fiber with the<br>
refractive index profile shown in FIGS. 4A-C.<br>
FIG. 7 shows the relative Brillouin gain spectrum of the optical fiber of the<br>
refractive index profile shown in FIGS. 6A-C. Similar to FIG. 5, the optical fiber of<br>
Example 1 or the comparative example was taken as a reference. The maximum relative<br>
Brillouin gain became 0.55, and the SBS threshold power was 2.6 dB improved.<br>
In addition to exhibiting optical characteristics satisfying ITU-T<br>
Recommendation G.652, the optical fiber of this embodiment is an optical fiber with a<br><br>
low bending loss and a high SBS threshold power, and has excellent characteristics as an<br>
optical fiber for FTTH.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>

characteristic.<br>
FIGS. 8A-C show an example of a low-bending-loss optical fiber based on the<br>
conventional techniques. This optical fiber has the concentration profiles and refractive<br>
index profile shown in Table 6.<br><br>
Such a refractive index profile can provide optical fibers having optical<br>
characteristics described below:<br>
Fiber cut-off : 1.26 µm.<br>
MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm: 7.36 µm.<br>
MFD at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 8.19 µm.<br>
Zero-dispersion wavelength: 1319.2 nm.<br>
Chromatic dispersion at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 17.4 ps/nm/km.<br>
Dispersion slope at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 0.060 ps/nm2/km.<br>

Bending loss at a bending diameter of 30 mm at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 
Bending loss at a bending diameter of 15 mm at a wavelength of 1310 nm: 
Bending loss at a bending diameter of 15 mm at a wavelength of 1550 nm: 
 <br>
Although the MFD at a wavelength of 1310 nm was 7.36 µm, which was<br>
somewhat small, the bending loss was improved with almost no increase in loss even<br>
when wound in a diameter of 15 mm. However, reduction in the MFD deteriorates the<br>
SBS threshold power. FIG. 9 shows the relative Brillouin gain spectrum of optical fiber<br>
of this example. Similar to FIG. 5, Example 1 or the comparative example was taken as<br>
a reference. The maximum relative Brillouin gain became 1.7, and the SBS threshold<br>
power became 2.3 dB smaller.<br>
FIGS. 10A-C and Table 7 show Example 27 of the optical fiber based on a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Although the Ge and F concentrations were higher in the inner core than the<br>
example based on the conventional techniques, the relative refractive index difference A<br>
was the same and optical characteristic, such as the MFD and the chromatic dispersion,<br>
became the same as those of the refractive index profile shown in FIGS. 8A-C.<br>
FIG. 11 shows the relative Brillouin gain spectrum of the optical fiber of the<br>
refractive index profile shown in FIGS. 10A-C. Similar to FIG. 5, Example 1 or the<br>
comparative example was taken as a reference. The maximum relative Brillouin gain<br>
became 0.67, and the SBS threshold power was 1.7 dB improved.<br>
In addition to exhibiting optical characteristics comparative to ITU-T<br>

low bending loss and a high SBS threshold power, and has excellent characteristics as an<br>
optical fiber for FTTH.<br>

signal can be demodulated into the signal of the original broadcast wave in a receiver<br>
portion of the broadcast system on the subscriber side. Therefore, a conventional<br>
television set can be used as it is.<br>
The system of FIG. 26 transmits a data signal and an analog signal (image<br>
signal) through the single the optical fiber 1. However, in the transmission system of<br>
the present invention, an optical fiber for a data signal and an optical fiber for an analog<br>
signal, separate from each other, may be used. In such a system, using the optical fiber<br>
of the present invention offers an advantage such as an extension in transmission<br>
distance.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described<br>
above, these should not be considered to be limitative of the invention. Addition,<br>
omission, and replacement of the constituents, and other modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The present invention is not<br>
limited by the descriptions above, but is limited only by the appended claims.<br><br>
