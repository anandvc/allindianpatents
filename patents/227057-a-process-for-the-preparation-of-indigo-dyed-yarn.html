				<td>This invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of indigo dyed yarn for use for manufacturing of knit fabric.<br>
The process of indigo dyed is well established in the prior art. Indigo dyeing is achieved by the process of surface dyeing wherein the dyeing of yarn is continuous on the surface only because of oxidation during the process. In this process the core of the yarn remains un-dyed and is always in its natural shape. The indigo dyeing is performed at room temperature and at the normal pressure. The yam is dyed in the form of a rope containing 240-400 ends throughout its length and is dyed by using a rope dyeing machine through a continuous process where a yarn is passed through a number of baths containing colour solution depending upon the shade required. It is an open bath system and yam gets air oxidation which is required for surface dyeing for indigo dyed yarn. The rope with 240-400 ends is prepared by a warping machine having full control of stop motion to avoid missing ends. The dyed rope obtain after the process of dyeing is delivered into a big synthetic Can which can accommodate 100 Kg. of rope at a time.<br>
The rope is then fed to the LCB beamer to convert the rope into a warper beam with required number of ends. The warper beam is further processed to get dyed yam for use for preparation of knit fabric. According to a process and as disclosed in the U.K. Patent No. 2140834 A and B, the dyed yarn from the dyed rope of yarn is received on the warper beam from a beamer directly. The machine is well equipped with warper stop motion and the drive to the warper beam is provided through friction roller driven by a<br>
motor. This machine also has vibrator to open the rope into individual ends for warping. The yarn is wound on intermediate spools (eight in number) from the warper beam. The spools are fixed on a swift like warping machine. Each spool receives 40 ends through a separator by feeding a yarn from the warper beam. The intermediate spools which are driven by motor are mounted on a swift like warping machine. The yarn is further wound as a single yarn on individual spool from intermediate spool of 40 ends. That is one intermediate spool feeds 40 spool having individual yarn to be wound for each of them. The individual spools are driven by a motor mounted on a tripod with shaft and bearing.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional process for indigo dyed yarn. One of the main disadvantage is that if one of the individual yarn thread breaks the whole machine has to be stopped instantly to the two ends and hence chances of yarn entanglement with other yarn is very high as a warper beam having dia 1000 mm is not stopped immediately due to its momentum. Thus, it not only affects the quality of the product but also affect the operation of the machine as a lot of time is wasted to trace the broken end of the yarn.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the beam is very heavy and thus the tension on the yam is very high due to volume of the beam and therefore heavy breakages during the process causes missing ends, bad quality and low production.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that 40 individual spools are fed from a single intermediate spool which causes problems during the process as the process is continuous process and is performed without stop motion and control spools.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that for individual cone each spindle of Cone winder is required with all arrangement of stop motion and guides for yarn having 40-45 spindle. Thus if one yarn breaks the cone and respective spool feeding a cone have to be stopped instantly to avoid missing ends or entanglement and such arrangement is unpracticable and it is very difficult to maintain the same.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional process used for converting a cone package of single yarn from a full width beam produced out of dyed rope is not healthy and is full of problems and is not useful for a commercial purpose.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a novel process for the preparation of indigo dyed yarn and which obviates the disadvantages associated with the conventional process.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel process wherein the use of warper beam to receive a dyed yarn from a dyed rope has been avoided.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a novel process for the preparation of indigo dyed yarn wherein the use of individual spool for receiving each yarn from the intermediate spools are not required.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a novel process wherein undesirable conventional process steps for converting a spool package of single yarn from a dyed rope has been totally avoided.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of indigo dyed yarn comprising receiving a dyed yarn from a dyed rope on a set of spools being fitted on the warper beam being driven by a friction drum adapted to be driven by a motor independently, each spool of said set of spools being provided for receiving a plurality of yarns through a warper comb and separator being provided with the machine, said spools for receiving said yarns being mounted on a tripod provided with bearings and shaft for feeding a reeling machine provided for preparing individual hank from the respective individual end of the spool, said hank being adapted to be mounted individually on an individual hank holder of hank to cone winding machine for converting said hank into cone of single yarn with desired weight.<br>
The process for the preparation of indigo dyed yarn according to a preferred embodiment of this invention is herein described in detail in the following description.In accordance with the process of this invention a dyed yarn from a dyed rope is received directly on a set of spools preferably a set of six spools instead of a warper beam in the conventional process. The spools are fitted on a warper beam shaft and are driven by a friction drum which is driven by a motor independently. Each spool receives 36 ends through warper comb and separator fitted suitably on the machine provided for this purpose. The machine is folly equipped with rope vibrator to open the rope into individual yarn and to stop motor so as to avoid in missing end. Six spools of 36 ends are Produced at a time with 12-13 Kg. of weight of yarn on each spool. The spools are mounted on a tripod with bearings and shaft to feed a reeling machine to prepare individual hank from individual end of the spool. The spool is self driven with the yarn tension inserted by yarn process while making hank on swift of reeling machine. In total 36 hanks are produced. Each hank is of 500 grams. This machine is equipped with yarn separators to avoid entanglement of yarn and is driven by motor. The hank is mounted individually on individual hank holder of hank to cone winding machine to convert hank into cone of single yarn with desired weight. These machines are well equipped with stop motions for hank as well as for cone for end breakage and works instantly. Each cone is driven individually through a friction roller driven by motor. In the present case, receiving the material (yarn) directly on 6 spools in place of warper beam is the development/invention and which totally avoids other undesirable process for converting a cone package of single yarn from dyed rope of 216 ends.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
