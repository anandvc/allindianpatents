The compounds of general formula I are prepared by methods known in principle. The following methods have proved particularly suitable for preparing the compounds of general formula I according to the invention:<br><br>
a) In order to prepare compounds of general formula (I) wherein A1 and A2 have the meanings given hereinbefore with the exception of an optionally alkyl-substituted amino group:<br>
coupling a carboxylic acid of general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ala and A2a have the meanings given hereinbefore for A1 and A2 with the exception of an optionally alkyl-substituted amino group and R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined,<br>
with a compound of general formula<br><br>
wherein R is as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The coupling is preferably carried out using methods known from peptide chemistry (cf. e.g. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. 15/2), for example using carbodiimides such as e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIC) or ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, 0-(lH-benzotriazol-1-yl)- N,N-N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) or -tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) or lH-benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP).

It has also proved satisfactory to carry out the acidolysis of compounds of general formula (XXVI) with methanolic hydrochloric acid solution under reflux conditions, although experience has shown that an attack on carboxamide and ester functions cannot be entirely ruled out, which is why the trifluoroacetic acid variant is generally the method of choice.<br>
n) In order to prepare compounds of general formula (I) wherein one of the two groups A1 and A2 denotes the hydrogen atom and the other denotes the group<br><br>
wherein R3 and Z are as hereinbefore defined and R4 denotes a branched or unbranched alkyl group comprising 1 to 7 carbon atoms which is substituted in the a position by an amino or an {{{[1,4']bipiperidinyl-1'-yl}-acetyl}amino} group and in the m position by a free amino group:<br>

The acidolysis is carried out with hydrogen bromide in organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid, pivalic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, but preferably in acetic acid, and at temperatures between 0 and 4 0°C, but preferably at room temperature, and preferably in the presence of excipients such as anisole, thioanisole, pentamethylbenzene or dimethylsulphide.<br>
The new substituted piperidines of general formula (I) according to the invention contain at least one chiral centre. If one of the groups R, A1 or A2 is also chiral, the compounds may occur in the form of two diastereomeric pairs of antipodes. The invention includes the individual isomers and the mixtures thereof.<br>
The diastereomers may be separated on the basis of their different physico-chemical properties, e.g. by fractional crystallisation from suitable solvents, by high pressure .liquid or column chromatography, using chiral or preferably non-chiral stationary phases.<br>
Racemates covered by general formula (I) may be separated for example by HPLC on  suitable chiral stationary phases (e.g.<br><br>
 Chiral AGP', Chiralpak AD) . Racemates which contain a basic or acidic function can also be separated via the diastereomeric, optically active salts which are produced on reacting with an optically active acid, for example (+) or (-)-tartaric acid, (+) or (-)-diacetyl tartaric acid, (+) or (-)-monomethyl tartrate or ( + )- camphorsulphonic acid, or an optically active base, for example with (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine, (S)-(-)-l-phenylethylamine or (S)-brucine.<br>
According to a conventional method of separating isomers, the racemate of a compound of general formula (I) is reacted with one  of the abovementioned optically active acids or bases in equimolar amounts in a solvent and the resulting crystalline, diastereomeric, optically active salts thereof are separated using their different solubilities. This reaction may be carried out in any type of solvent provided that it is sufficiently different in terms of the, solubility of the salts. Preferably, methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof, for example in a ratio by volume of 50:50, are used. Then each of the optically active salts is dissolved in water, neutralised with a base such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide solution or potassium hydroxide solution and in this way the corresponding free compound is obtained in the (+) or (-) form.<br>
The (R) or (S) enantiomer alone or a mixture of two optically active diastereomeric compounds covered by general formula I may also be obtained by performing the syntheses described above with a suitable reaction component in the (R) or (S) configuration.<br>
The starting compounds of general formula (III) may be obtained analogously to methods known from the literature from a-amino-y-oxo-arenobutanoic acids (cf. for example: J. E. Nordlander,<br><br>
M. J. Payne, F. G. Njoroge, V. M. Vishwanath, G. R. Han, G. D. Laikos and M. A. Balk, J. Org. Chem. 50, 3619 (1985)) or {3-<br>

The starting compounds of general formula (IV) which are not known from the literature or even commercially obtainable, may be obtained according to the processes described in WO 98/11128 and DE 199 52 146. Starting compounds of general formula (V) may be prepared from compounds of general formula (III) by derivatisation in the usual way. The carboxylic acids of general formula (VI) required as starting compounds are commercially obtainable or may be prepared by known methods. The starting compounds of general formulae VII and VII' may be obtained by the process e) described hereinbefore.

The starting materials of general formula XVIII may be obtained from the compounds of general formulae VII or VII' described hereinbefore by reaction, in the presence of triethylamine, for example, with mainly commercially obtainable compounds of general formula<br><br>
wherein X denotes a halogen atom, such as chlorine, bromine or iodine. The starting compounds of general formulae (XX) and (XX') may be obtained by the methods given in DE 199 52 146, but may also be formed in  situ  from suitably substituted 4-aryl-4-oxobutyric acid piperidides which all carry an amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group in the 2 position. The starting compounds of general formulae (XXI) and (XXVII) come under the definition of general formula (I) and can be prepared using the processes described hereinbefore. The starting compounds of general formula (XXIII) may easily be prepared, for example, from those compounds of general formula (I) wherein A1 or A2 denotes an optionally alkyl-substituted amino group, by reacting with suitable acid chlorides or bromides in known manner. The starting compounds of general formula (XXV)<br><br>
are also prepared from compounds of general formula (I) by reaction with suitably substituted carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives which are commercially obtainable or easily produced by known methods under the conditions of process c) or d).<br>
The compounds of general formula I obtained may, if they contain basic functions, be converted, particularly for pharmaceutical use, into their physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Suitable acids include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
Moreover, the new compounds of formula (I), if they contain an' acid function, for example a carboxy group, may if desired be converted into the addition salts thereof with inorganic or organic bases, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable addition salts thereof. Suitable bases for this include, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia, cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
The new compounds of general formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have CGRP-antagonistic properties and exhibit good affinities in CGRP receptor binding studies. The compounds display CGRP-antagonistic properties in the pharmacological test systems described hereinafter.<br><br>
The following experiments were carried out to demonstrate the affinity of compounds of general formula I for human CGRP-receptors and their antagonistic properties:<br>
A. Binding studies with SK-N-MC cells (expressing the human CGRP receptor)<br>
SK-N-MC cells are cultivated in "Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium". The medium is removed from confluent cultures. The cells are washed twice with PBS buffer (Gibco 041-04190 M) , detached by the addition of PBS buffer, mixed with 0.02% EDTA, then detached again and isolated by centrifuging. After resuspension in 20 ml of "Balanced Salts Solution" [BSS (in mM): NaCl 120, KCl 5.4, NaHC03 16.2, MgS04 0.8, NaHP04 1.0,<br>
CaCl2 1.8, D-glucose 5.5, HEPES 30, pH 7.40] the cells* are<br>
centrifuged twice at 100 x g and resuspended in BSS. After the number of cells has been determined, the cells are homogenised using an Ultra-Turrax and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 x g. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is recentrifuged in Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2/ 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.40), enriched with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% bacitracin) and resuspended (1 ml / 1000000 cells). The homogenised product is'frozen at -80°C. The membrane preparations are stable for more than 6 weeks under these conditions.<br>
After thawing, the homogenised product is diluted 1:10 with assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA,<br>
pH 7.40) and homogenised for 30 seconds with an Ultra-Turrax. 230 μl of the homogenised product are incubated for 180 minutes<br>
at ambient temperature with 50 pM 125I-iodotyrosyl-Calcitonin-<br><br>
Gene-Related Peptide (Amersham) and increasing concentrations of the test substances in a total volume of 250 /zl. The incubation is ended by rapid filtration through GF/B-glass fibre filters treated with polyethyleneimine (0.1%) using a cell harvester. The protein-bound radioactivity is measured using a gamma counter. Non-specific binding is defined as the bound radioactivity in the presence of 1 /zM human CGRP-alpha during incubation.<br>
The concentration binding curves are analysed using computer-aided non-linear curve matching.<br>
The compounds of general formula I show IC50 values £  1000 0 nM in the test described.<br>
B. CGRP Antagonism in SK-N-MC cells<br>
SK-N-MC cells (1 million cells) are washed twice with 250	/zl<br>
incubation buffer (Hanks' HEPES, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-l-<br>
methylxanthine, 1% BSA, pH 7.4) and pre-incubated at 37°C	for<br>
15 minutes. After the addition of CGRP (10 /zl) as agonist	in<br>
increasing concentrations (10-11 to 10~6 M), or additionally the substance in 3 to 4 different concentrations, the mixture is incubated for another 15 minutes.<br>
Intracellular cAMP is then extracted by the addition of 20 /zl of 1M HC1 and centrifugation (2000 x g, 4°C, for 15 minutes). The supernatants are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C.<br>
The cAMP contents of the samples are determined by radioimmunoassay (Messrs. Amersham) and the pA2 values of<br>
antagonistically acting substances are determined graphically.<br><br>
The compounds of general formula I exhibit CGRP-antagonistic properties in the in vitro test model described, in a dosage range of between 10-11 to lO-5 M.<br>
In view of their pharmacological properties the compounds of general formula I and the salts thereof with physiologically acceptable acids or bases are thus suitable for the acute and prophylactic treatment of headaches, particularly migraine or cluster headaches. Moreover, the compounds of general formula I also have a positive effect on the following diseases: non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ("NIDDM"), cardiovascular diseases, morphine tolerance, skin diseases, particularly thermal and radiation-induced skin damage including sunburn, inflammatory diseases, e.g. inflammatory diseases of the joints (arthritis), inflammatory lung diseases, allergic rhinitis, asthma, diseases accompanied by excessive vasodilatation and consequent reduced circulation of blood through the tissues, e.g. shock and sepsis. The symptoms of menopausal hot flushes in oestrogen-deficient women caused by vasodilatation and increased blood flow are favourably affected by the CGRP-antagonists of the present application in a preventive and acute-therapeutic capacity, this therapeutic approach being distinguished from hormone replacement by the absence of side effects. Furthermore, the compounds of general formula I have an alleviating effect on pain in general.<br>
The dosage required to achieve a corresponding effect is conveniently 0.001 to 30 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.01 to 5 mg/kg of body weight, when administered intravenously or subcutaneously and 0.01 to 50 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.1 to 30 mg/kg of body weight when administered orally, nasally or by inhalation, 1 to 3 x a day in each case.<br><br>

The dosage of these active substances is expediently 1/5 of the lowest recommended dose to 1/1 of the normally recommended dose, i.e. for example 2 0 to 100 mg of sumatriptan.<br><br>
  The invention further relates to the use of the compounds of general formula I as valuable adjuvants for the production and purification (by affinity chromatography) of antibodies as well as, after suitable radioactive labelling, for example by direct labelling with 125j or 131j or by tritiation of suitable precursors, for example by replacing halogen atoms with tritium, in RIA and ELISA assays and as a diagnostic or analytical adjuvant in neurotransmitter research.<br>
