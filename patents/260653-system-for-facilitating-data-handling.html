				<td>Title    SYSTEMS AND MET HODS THAT DETERMINE INTENT OF DATA AND RESPOND TO THE DATA BASED ON THE INTENT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) This application claims the benefit of U S Provisional Patent Application Serial No 60/549,075 filed on March 1, 2004, and entitled "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DFTERMINING, INFERRING, OR PREDICTING INTENT OF AN ITEM HAVING CONTENT," the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to computer systems, and mors particularly to systems and methods that receive one or more sets of data, analyze the data to determine a corresponding intent, and perform an,action based on the intent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With the growth of computer and information systems and related net vork technologies such as wireless and Internet communications, ever increasing amounts of electronic information are communicated, transferred and subsequently processed by users and/or systems  As an example, electronic mail programs have become a popular application among computer users for generating and receiving such information   With the advent of the Internet, for example, exchanging e-mail has become an important factor influencing why many people acquire computers   Within many corporate environments, e-mail has become almost a de facto standard by which coworkers exchange information  However, with the heightened popularity of e-mail and other information transfer systems, problems have begun to appear in regard to managing and processing increasing amounts of information from a plurality of sources<br>
Among these problems, many users now face a deluge of e-mail and/nr other information from which to sort through and/or respond, such that the capability of being able to send, receive and process information has almost become a hindrance to being productive   For example, some users report receiving over 100 e-mail messages a day With such large numbers of e-mail and other electronic information, 't has thus become<br><br>
difficult to manage information according to what is important and what is not as important without substantially expending valuable time to make a personal determination as to the importance As an example of these determinations, users may have to decide whether messages should be responded to immediately, passed over to be read at a later time, or simply deleted due to non-importance (e g, junk mail)<br>
Attempts have been directed at resolving information management problems  For example, attempts have been made to curtail the amount of junk or promotional e-mail (e g, spam) that users receive  Additionally, some electronic mail programs provide for the generation of rules that govern how e-mail is managed within the program  For example, a rule providing, "all e-mails from addresses" are to be placed in a special folder  Such attempts generally are not directed at the basic problem behind e-mail and other information transfer/reception systems  That is, conventional systems often cause users to manually peruse and check at least a portion of some if not all of their received messages in order to determine which messages should be reviewed or further processed As described above, this takes time from more productive activities  Thus, with the large quantities of information being received, there is a need for a system and methodology to facilitate efficient processing of electronic information while mitigating the costs of manual interventions associated therewith<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention  This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention  It is intended to neither identify key or cntical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the invention   Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods that respond to received data (e g, email, voice, graphics   ) based on intent of the data  In general, the systems and methods analyze and categonze received data, extract the data related to intent and/or discard any data unrelated to intent, and determine the intent from this extracted set of data  If it is determined that the intent warrants a response, the data is further scrutinized<br>
and reformulated to generate a description that is indicative of the intent  Such description can be vanously presented to a user, for example, visually and/or audibly The novel systems and methods described herein employ various combinations of features based on shallow linguistic analysis (e g, function word frequencies, part of speech tngrams   ) and deep linguistic analysis (e g, context free grammar production frequencies and features derived from semantic graphs) to yield improved accuracy in attributing a short random text sample to a specific source<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a system is provided that determines intent and generates actions and/or notifications based thereon  The system includes a data manager that can employ various techniques to determine an associated intent of the data In one instance, the data manager utilizes information such as metadata, properties, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, extrinsic information such the source of the data, the time of day and/or day of week the data was transmitted and/or received, cost/benefit of handling the data, etc to group data into one or more sets of data with similar characteristics  The data manager can extract data related to the intent and/or discard data unrelated to the intent  The data indicative of the intent can be analyzed to determine whether to respond to the data  When it is determined that a response should be provided, respective data can be further refined, reformulated, and employed to generate a suitable response such as automatically performing an action and/or notifying a user, for example  The data manager can include various components such as an analyzer that performs an initial analysis of received data, a parser that separates the data into various groupings, an extractor the reduces the data to a set of data related to the intent, a classifier that generates the intent from the reduced set of data, a decision component (thresholder) that determines whether the intent warrants a response, and an action engine that performs related actions and/or notifies a user(s)<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for determining intent of data  Such intent can be determined via analyzing and categorizing the data, extracting features from the categorized data, and classifying the data based on the features to ascertain, infer and/or predict the intent  The data in which the intent was identified can then be transformed to a representation that can be provided to a user<br>
As used in this application, the terms "component," "system," "engine," and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution   For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer  By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers<br>
In addition, the term "inference" generally refers to the process of reasomng about or inferring states of the system, environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data  Inference can be employed to identify a specif c context or action, or can generate a probability distnbution over states, for example  The inference can be probabilistic - that is, the computation of a probability distnbution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events   Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources<br>
The present invention is descnbed with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout   In the following descnption, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention   It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details  In<br>
other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate descnbing the present invention<br>
FIG 1 illustrates a system 100 that determines intent and generates actions and/or notifications based thereon  The system 100 includes a data manager 110 and an interface component 120  The data manager 110, upon receiving data via the interface component 120, can employ various techniques to determine an associated intent of the data  In one instance, the data manager 110 utilizes information associated with the data such as metadata, properties, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, etc to group the data into one or more sets of data, wherein respective sets have similar charactenstics   Such sets of data can be further processed to increase decision resolution or granularity  The data manager 110 can extract information from the resultant sets and utilize the extracted information to decipher intent<br>
The data manager 110 can analyze the intent to determine whether to respond to the data  When it is determined that a response should be provided, respective sets of data can be further refined and employed to generate a suitable response   Suitable responses include automatically performing an action and/or notifying a user, for example   Automatic responses can include answenng questions, providing requested information, activating a device, scheduling a meeting, recasting a project, etc, and notifying the user can include inserting an item into the user's schedule, providing the user with a list of things to do, contacting the user (e g, pager, cell phone, hand held   ), etc  In addition, user notifications can be conveyed to a messaging service and/or stored in memory for queuing and/or subsequent viewing by the user<br>
The interface component 120 can be utilized to couple the data manager 110 to essentially any entity that transmits data For example, the interface component 120 can couple the data manager 110 to email systems, word processors, voice capture applications, telephones systems, video recorders/players, etc  Thus, the data can be in the form of email, a document, voice, and an image, for example, and vanously formatted (e g, structured and unstructured)   In addition, the data can be transmitted to the interface component 120 and/or retneved by the data manager 110 through the interface component 120  Such data can be conveyed directly to the interface component 120<br>
and/or stored (e g , locally or remotely) and subsequently provided to the interface component 120   In another instance, the interface component 120 can retrieve the data from a source and/or transmit a signal to the source to indicate that it is available to receive data  Moreover, such conveyances can be over a hardwired and/or wireless network and/or bus communication channel, for example<br>
FIG 2 illustrates the data manager 110 in accordance with an aspect of the invention  As depicted, the data manager 110 can include an intent determining component 210, a storage component 220, a decision-making component 230 and an action engine 240  The intent determining component 210 can receive data such as email, messages, documents, audio, graphics, etc  Such data can be provided as one or more data bursts, a data stream, and a plurality of data packets, for example, and encrypted, encoded, compressed, and/or modulated within an envelope, for example  In addition, such data can be saved in the storage component 220   Saved data can be utilized to generate statistics and/or training sets, provide temporary storage, and/or maintain a copy to facilitate data error checking and error recovery<br>
The intent-determmmg component 210 can employ various techniques to determine an associated intent of the data For example, the intent-determining component 210 can categorize the data based on metadata, location within the data, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, etc  In addition, extrinsic information such the source of the data, the time of day and/or day of week the data was transmitted and/or received, cost/benefit of handling the data, etc can be utilized to facilitate categonzing the data  The mtent-determming component 210 can scrutinize the categorized data to determine the intent of the data  It is to be appreciated that such intent can be intent to do something {e g, perform some action) or nothing (e g, data associated with frivolous information)<br>
Upon determining the intent, the data or subset thereof, the analysis and/or the intent can be saved to the storage component 220 and/or provided to the decis.on-making component 230  The intent can be represented in essentially any known format  For example, the intent can be provided as a binary indicator, a gray scale value, a percentage, confidence level, and/or a probability, for example  The decision-making component 230 can determine whether the intent warrants a response  For example, the<br>
decision-making component 230 can utilize a threshold to compare with the intent  The threshold can be user defined, default and/or automatically set based on past user responses  In addition, the threshold can be manually and/or automatically adjusted in real-time (dynamically) to adapt to various users and/or circumstances  Moreover, the threshold can be set based on inferences, predictions, probabilities, etc<br>
If after evaluating the intent it is determined that no further action is desired, the data can be discarded or forwarded to its destination   If it is determined that a response is desired, the data, the intent and/or any associated information can be conveyed to the action-engine 240  The conveyed information can be further analyzed and transformed into a linguistic representation, which can be utilized to generate a description  Such description can be utilized to automatically respond and/or notify a user via a visual and/or audible notification<br>
FIG 3 illustrates the data manager 110 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention  The data manager 110 comprises the intent determining component 210, the storage component 220, the decision-making component 230 and the action engine 240  In this example, the intent-determining component 210 includes the following components an analyzer 310, a parser 320, an extractor 330, and a classifier 340   Data such as email, messages, documents, audio, graphics, etc transmitted to the data manager 110 can be received by the analyzer 310 and/or the storage component 220 Such data can be provided via various techniques and formats, as described above  The analyzer 310 can scrutinize and categorize the data (eg, parse into respective bms) Such categorization can include distinguishing between header, body, salutation, etc The analyzer 310 can categorize the data based on metadata, location of a subset of data within the data, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, extrinsic information such the source of the data, the time of day and/or day of week the data was transmitted and/or received, cost/benefit of handling the data, etc<br>
The parser 320 can scrutinize the categorized data and separate the data into logical structures such as stnngs, words, sentences, paragraphs       Similar to the analyzer 310, the parser 320 can utilize information such as metadata, location of the set of data within the data, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules,<br>
demarcations, and/or other criteria to increase decision resolution or refine decision granularity   For respective structures, the extractor 330 can extract features<br>
The features can be conveyed to the classifier 340, which can determine intent Such intent can be intent to do something (e g, perform some action) or nothing {e g, data associated with frivolous information) and can be provided as a binary indicator (e g, "yes" or "no," "1" or "0,"   ), a sliding scale, a percentage, confidence level, and/or a probability, for example  It is to be appreciated that the classifier can be any classifier such as a Support Vector Machine, Bayesian, knowledge-engineered classifier Training sets can be manually and/or automatically generated and utilized during training-time to train the classifier  In addition, the classifier can be dynamically updated during run-time  In one aspect of the invention, the training sets at least include information related to data properties and linguistic structure<br>
As described above, the intent can be provided to the decision component 230, which can compare the intent with a threshold  For non-bmary indicia, a threshold can be defined and utilized to render a decision such as respond or do not respond  For non-bmary decisions, various circumstances can be considered to determine an appropriate cut-off point  For example, one user may decide it is better to err on the cautious side and have the system respond when there is a slightest chance that an action should be performed, whereas another user may decide that the cost of responding outweighs the cost of discarding data<br>
If after evaluating the intent it is determined that no further action is desired, the data can be discarded or forwarded to its destination  If it is determined that a response is desired, the data, the intent and/or any associated information can be conveyed to the action-engine 240, where it can be reformulated  For example, the data can be further analyzed, transformed into a logical representation, and utilized to generate a description Such reformulated data can be in the form of words, phrases, fragments sentences, etc and utilized to automatically respond and/or notify a user via a visual and/or audible notification<br>
FIGs 4-5 illustrate a flow diagram and methodology, respectively, in accordance with the present invention  While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the flow diagram and methodology are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be<br>
understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the acts, as some acts can, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and descnbed herein  Moreover, not all illustrated acts are required to implement the flow diagram and methodology in accordance with the present invention  The invention can be descnbed in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more components  Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, data structures, etc that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types  Typically the functionality of the program modules can be combined or distnbuted as desired in vanous embodiments<br>
FIG 4 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram 400 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention  At reference numeral 410, it is determined whether data is present If not, the system continues to wait  It is to be appreciated that the system can penodically poll for data and/or can be notified when data is ready to be conveyed  If it is determined data is available, at 420 one or more feature sets are obtained from the data In addition, features can be extracted based on metadata, content, context, keywords, history, heunstics, inferences, rules, demarcations, extnnsic information such the source of the data, the time of day and/or day of week the data was transmitted and/or received, cost/benefit of handling the data, etc<br>
At reference numeral 430, the features can be conveyed to a machine-learned classifier to determine intent  Such intent can be intent to do something (e g, perform some action) or nothing (e g, data associated with frivolous information)   At 440, if it is determined that the intent does not require any further action, the system transitions back to an idle or wait state at 410  However, if at 440 it is determined that further action is required, then at 450 the data is reformulated  Such reformulation can include further refining of the data and generation of data useful to appnsing a user  At reference numeral 460, such data can be presented to the user, for example, within a graphical user interface and/or audio information<br>
FIG 5 illustrates an exemplary methodology 500 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention   At reference numeral 505, data such as email, messages, documents, audio, graphics, etc is obtained  At 510, the data is scrutinized and<br>
categorized  Such categorization can include distinguishing between header, body, salutation, etc, based on metadata, location of a subset of data within the data, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, extrinsic information such the source of the data, the time of day and/or day of week the data was transmitted and/or received, cost/benefit of handling the data, etc  At 515, the categorized data can be parsed into linguistic structures (e g, strings, words, sentences, paragraphs   ) and further delineated to achieve greater resolution   Such refinement can be facilitated by metadata, location of the set of data within the data, content, context, keywords, history, heuristics, inferences, rules, demarcations, and/or other criteria to increase decision resolution or refine decision granularity<br>
At 520, features can be extracted from respective structures The features can be utilized to train classifiers that determine intent  Suitable classifiers include support vector machines, Bayesian classifiers, knowledge-engineered classifiers, for example  At reference numeral 525, the classifier determines the intent  At 530, it can be determined whether there is the intent to do something or merely an idle intent  Such determination can be based on a comparison with predefined threshold  If at 530 it is determined that no further action is desired, the data can be discarded or forwarded to its destination  If at 530 it is determined that a response is desired, the data, the intent and/or any associated information can be utilized to generate a logical form at 535   At 540, a description can be generated based on the logical form  At 5 45, descnption can be presented *o user via a user interface<br>
FIG 6 illustrates, a data manager 600 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention  The data manager 600 includes a data-receiving component 610 that receives an item (e g, data) including content as well as extrinsic data/evidence  An extraction component 620 parses the received item, for example based in part on the extrinsic data/evidence   The extraction component 620 removes extraneous features associated with the item in connection with facilitating the data manager 600 to reformulate the item as part of converging on intent of the item  A data store 630 can store information from the receiving component 610 and/or the extraction component 620, as well as rules, tables, indices, algorithms, historical data, schemas, etc, to facilitate determining, inferring and/or predicting intent in accordance with the invention as well as taking<br>
action, scheduling action, not taking action, etc  The data manager 600, for example, can facilitate taking proactive measures to mitigate negative consequences associated with inaction in connection with an item<br>
More particularly, the data manager 600 can parse content associated with an item - the content can be text, audio, graphical, etc and using various techniquss (language processor, image recognition, voice recognition   ) identify extraneous features of the content and remove them and/or discount them as part of a reformulation process to converge on intent of the item   For example, the data manager 600 can identify or infer parts of an item that corresponds to task(s) and trim away extraneous features  As part of the reformulation process, for example, pronouns can be recast as names or other explicit references and implicit dates ("tomorrow", "next week") can be recast as explicit dates ("February 20,2005")  The data manager 600 understands linguistics and/or semantics of a language as part of performing logical reconstruction  The data manager 600 can include a classifier or other machine learning system in connection with understanding linguistics and/or semantics of content<br>
Thus, the data manager 600 provides for a rich analysis system that couples feature extraction with linguistic understanding of content to determine, infer ard/or predict intent of an item   In accordance with one specific exemplary implementation of the data manager 600, a real natural language processor can be employed that parses the item in connection with reformulation to converge on intent - logical construction  The reformulation can also be used to retranslate intent into another language as well as different format for conveying intent (e g, via graphical-based message)  Moreover, the data manager 600 can take action based on the determined intent (e g, prioritizing, calendaring, automated action   )<br>

FIG 8 illustrates a methodology 800 in accordance with the present invention While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and descnbed as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the acts, as some acts can, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and descnbed herein  Moreover, not all illustrated acts can be required to implement the methodology in accordance with the present invention  The invention can be descnbed in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more components   Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, data structures, etc that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types  Typically the functionality of the program modules can be combined or distributed as desired in vanous embodiments<br>
Proceeding to FIG 8, at 810 data is received  At 820, relevant features of the data are identified and parsed   At reference numeral 830, the parsed content is analyzed and a reformulation of the content is performed to converge on intent   Such reformulation can include a linguistic analysis as well as feature analysis, for example  At 840, a determination is made as to optimal action to be taken based on the reformulation For example, data can be moved to a specific folder, or if the item corresponds to a task, further reformulation can be performed to determine, infer and/or predict the task to be performed as well as the necessary action to be taken (e g, calendar a meeting, send an e-mail, notify someone, send a document, cancel a meeting   )  At reference numeral 850, a suitable action is performed<br>
FIGs 9-11 illustrate exemplary user interfaces that facilitate the invention descnbed herein  As discussed in detail above, upon receiving data, intent can be determined and a corresponding action can be performed   By way of example, after receiving an email message, a superficial analysis of the email can be performed to distinguish sections within the email   For example, the email can be delineated via the following a header, a message body, and forwarded sections  The identified message body can be separated by sentences  For respective sentence, features can be extracted<br>
and processed by a machine-learned classifier in order to obtain an estimate of a probability that a sentence is a "Task " If the sentence is a "Task," the sentence can be analyzed to produce a logical form   The logical form can be transformed and utilized to generate a "Task" description, which can be presented to a user via a user interface  Such presentation can occur by automatically adding it to the user's task list  FIG 9 depicts an exemplary user interface 900 for such an email system  FIG 10 shows various emails that have been identified (as descnbed herein) at 1010  In addition, FIG 10 shows highlighted data within an email at 1020 and extracted and reformulated data (e g, strings) at 1030  FIG 11 illustrates a task list being populated via reformulated data selected by the user and/or automatically<br>
FIG 12 provides an example illustrating various training and run-time aspects of the subject invention   At 1200 and 1210, email sentences and new email sentences, respectively, are received  At 1220, an annotated data set is generated from the received email via a manual and/or automatic technique  At 1230, the training sets are fed into a machine-learning algorithm, which is utilized to construct a machine-learned classifier At 1240, the machine-learned classifier employs the algorithm to render a probability that received data includes a task (e g, P(Task))   If at 1240, the probability exceeds a predefined threshold, then at 1270, the email is reformulated and automatically added to the user's task list<br>
The following paragraphs illustrate exemplary training and run time techniques in accordance with aspects of the present invention<br>
Exemplary Feature Extraction<br>
At both training time and run-time, email messages can be similarly processed For example, the systems descnbed herein can identify a header, forwarded sections, and a message body of the email In one instance, the header can be identified by searching for keywords such as "To," "CC," "From," and "Subject," for example The forwarded sections can be identified by searching for expressions such as the presence of line-initial "&gt;" symbols or identifying matenal that typically follows text such as "Onginal Message " The message body can be identified by searching for new content of the message, for example, defined as anything that is not the header or a forwarded section<br>
Upon identifying such information, salient features can be obtained   For example, information such as the number of addressees, the total size of the message, the message priority, and whether the message had an attachment can be obtained   In addition, the message body can be broken into sentences using any known sentence separator  For respective sentences in the body, a feature vector can be built, wherein the feature vector can include the message-level features extracted and the identified salient features of the sentence   Such information can be indicative of whether the sentence appears to be the sender's name or an abbreviation of the sender's name and linguistic features, such as words that occur in the sentence, word bigrams that occur in the sentence, word tngrams from the sentence, features that result from a linguistic analysis, including syntactic structure and properties and logical form structure and properties  It is to be appreciated that the set of features to employ can be an open research question as descnbed in detail below  It is further to be appreciated that any suitable machine-learned classifiet can be used, such as, for example, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a knowledge engineered component (e g, hand-written code that considered the features extracted and that then predicted Task vs Non-task)<br>
Exemplary training data and model training<br>
In order to create training data for a machine-learned classifier, a human annotator can review respective sentences in the message body of respective messages in a training set  For such sentences, the annotator can decide whether the sentence should be classified as a task or not   The annotator's judgment can be referred to as the target value or target class  Features can be automatically extracted for respective sentences and paired with the target value A machine-learned classifier can be trained to distinguish tasks from non-tasks with respect to the automatically extracted features<br>
Exemplary Run-Time Application<br>
At run-time, the systems descnbed herein can process a given email message in the manner descnbed herein  For respective sentences in the message body, the associate feature vector can be presented to the machire-learned classifier, which produces an estimate of a probability that a sentence is a task (e g, P(Task))   If a sentence is deemed a task (e g, the P(Task) exceeds a threshold), the sentence can be analyzed to produce a<br>
logical form   The logical form can be reformulated and utilized to generate a task description from the logical form  The generated task description can be provided to the user, for example, by automatically adding it to a user's task list of a user interface<br>
Exemplary Reformulation of a task<br>
The systems described herein can perform a rule-based post-processing of extracted task sentences in order to reformulate them as task-like imperatives  For example, the sentence "Oh, by the way, could you just send me a few sentences by EOD Friday7" can be reformulated to "Just send Rich a few sentences by EOD Feb 20 " Such reformulation can involve various acts  For example, one act can include producing a logical form for an extracted sentence  Another act can include identifying the part of the sentence that includes the task  Yet another act can include (in essentially any order) focusing on the identified part and removing from the logical form extraneous material, normalizing certain elements of the sentence whose reference vanes with the speaker or time, and, where appropriate, labeling the fragment as an imperative sentence   Still another act can include passing the resulting structure to a sentence-realization component, which can generate a sentence from the structure    The following sections discuss the foregoing acts in more detail<br>
As briefly noted above, one act can include producing a logical form for an extracted sentence  This can comprise producing a representation that shows the semantic and deep syntactic relations among the various parts of the sentence  This representation can be a graph, whose nodes represent the parts of the sentence being analyzed, and whose edges represent the relations among those parts  Additionally, the nodes themselves can be annotated with additional information having to do with its interpretation, such as whether it is a question or command, for example<br>
A sentence containing a task can have non-task content As such, heuristics can be utilized when identifying the part of the logical form that corresponds to the task  This can include the whole sentence or any sub-part of the sentence   The heuristics utilized can facilitate locating features relevant to tasks, such as whether the sentence is imperative, whether the subject of a sentence is "you", whether modality words such as<br>
"please" or a modal verb is used, etc  Further processing can be performed on the identified logical form, wherein remaining portions can be ignored<br>
Words, phrases and/or clauses deemed unnecessary to task formulation can be removed from the logical form  Such information can include modal words such as "please" and/or various auxiliary verbs such as "must," "could," etc, as well as certain subordinate clauses and adverbial modifiers  For example, in the sentence "Oh, by the way, could you just send me a few sentences by EOD Friday?," the phrase "oh, by the way" and the auxiliary verb "could" can be lemoved from the logical form   In addition, certain deictic elements (/ e , words or phrases whose reference changes depending on who is speaking or being spoken to, or when or where a sentence is uttered or written) can be normalized  For example, they can be replaced by non-deictic elements with constant reference  For example, a first person pronoun, which refers differently for different speakers, can be replaced by the name of the sender of the email or by a third person pronoun that unambiguously refers to the sender  Similarly, a deictic time expression such as "Friday," which may refer to a different date depending on the week that it is spoken, can be replaced by a specific date (e g, "Feb 20")  Moreover, if the logical form has certain features that indicate it could be formulated as an imperative (eg ,a command) sentence, it can be annotated as an imperative<br>
A sentence can be regenerated by passing the resulting logical form, or structure to a sentence-realization component   Such component can utilize known technology that underlies the suggestion of rewrites in grammar checkers<br>
Exemplary Customization<br>
A user can be provided an ability to define (e g, by adjusting a slider) the tradeoff between precision and recall of tasks, for example, in order to specify whether they would rather see all predicted tasks, no matter how minor, or only the tasks predicted with the highest confidence  Other customization can include configuring the system to automatically add tasks to the user's task list, visually indicate (e g by displaying a special icon or by colonng a message) that an email message contains one or more tasks, which can be filtered to only see messages that contain tasks, display, in the preview of a message, tasks present in the message rather than displaying the first n bytes, highlight<br>
sections of a message that correspond to tasks, and, when a user opens a message, display a list of tasks extracted from the message, which allows the user to check messages to add them to their task list or to move them to a shared set of tasks (eg.ona SharePoint team site or to assign the task to someone else)<br>
