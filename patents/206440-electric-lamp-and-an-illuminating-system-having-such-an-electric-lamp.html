Electric lamp and an illuminat5.ng system having such an electric lamp<br>
The invention relates to an electric lamp   and  to  an<br>
illuminating system having such a lamp.<br>
I. Prior art<br>
Such an electric lamp is disclosed, for example, in the International Patent Application WO 97/25733. This laid-open application describes an electric incandescent  lamp,  in  particular  a  motor  vehicle<br>
headlight lamp, having an incandescent filament enclosed in a vitreous lamp bulb, and a lamp cap consisting of metal parts and plastic parts. The pinch foot, sealed in a gas-tight fashion, of the lamp bulb is fixed in a metal holder part which is, for its part, connected directly or via an intermediate ring to a metal, ring-shaped support sleeve. The metal support sleeve  is anchored in the plastic cap part, equipped with the electric terminals of the lamp, of the lamp cap. To mount the lamp in the opening, designed as a lampholder, of a reflector, the ring-shaped support sleeve has three reference noses which are arranged in one plane, are distributed equidistantly over the circumference of the support sleeve and engage in the lamp mounting opening of the reflector, and a press-on spring, acting radially outwards, which bears with a clamping fit against the edge of the lamp mounting opening of the reflector. Below the three reference noses, the support sleeve respectively has a point of contact with the edge of the lamp mounting opening of the reflector. One of these points of contact is formed by the press-on spring. The three reference noses are situated on  the  inner  side  of  the  reflector.  The<br>
- 2 -<br>
sealing, of the lamp mounting opening, designed as a lampholder, of the reflector is performed by means of a silicone sealing ring Which is arranged between the reflector outer side and the plastic cap part of the lamp cap. This lamp cap, constructed from metal parts and plastic parts, ensures, on the one hand, by means of its metal holder parts for the lamp bulb an exact adjustment of the position of the incandescent filament with respect to the reference plane defined by the three reference noses and, by means of its plastic cap part, adequate sealing of the lamp cap and the reflector against moisture. However, a burr, formed during the production of the reflector, on the outer edge of the lamp mounting opening of the reflector has an unfavourable influence on the mounting position of the lamp, and causes an undesired maladjustment of the incandescent filament with respect to the optical axis of the reflector.<br>
II, Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide an electric lamp having an improved lamp cap, in the case of which the disadvantage of the lamps in accordance with the prior art is avoided. In particular, the aim is for the lamp according to the invention to be capable of being mounted without any problem with the correct position of the incandescent filament with reference to the optical axis of the reflector despite any possible formation of burrs on the lamp mounting opening of the reflector.<br>
The electric lamp according to the invention has a lamp cap, a transparent lamp bulb and at least one luminous<br>
- 3 -<br>
means surrounded by the lamp bulb. The lamp cap has a metal holder part in which the lamp bulb is fixed, and a metal, ring-shaped support sleeve connected to the holder part, as well as a plastic cap part which is provided with the electric terminals of the lamp and in which the support sleeve is anchored. The ring-shaped support sleeve has three reference noses lying in a common plane arranged perpendicular to the ring axis, which serve to engage in a mounting opening, designed as a lampholder, of a reflector, and a press-on spring which acts radially outwards and serves to fix the lamp in the opening, designed as a lampholder, of the reflector, the press-on spring being arranged below a first reference nose. According to the invention, on its outer side, below the second and third reference nose, the ring-shaped support sleeve in each case has a depression or a cutout at a distance from the reference noses. Consequently, any possible burr on the lamp mounting opening of the reflector has no points of contact with the lamp cap. The maladjustment of the position of the luminous means with reference to the reflector axis is prevented in this way, since the three points of contact of the support sleeve with the edge of the lamp mounting opening of the reflector are arranged outside the region of the lamp mounting opening which is possibly affected by a burr.<br>
In addition to the lamp with the features described above, the illuminating system according to the invention has a reflector which has a reflector inner side facing the lamp bulb and a reflector outer side averted from the lamp bulb, as well as a light exit opening and a lamp mounting opening designed as a lampholder. This lamp mounting opening is delimited by an edge which has an inner edge on the reflector inner side and an outer edge on the reflector outer side. The reference noses of the lamp engage in the lamp mounting opening and bear against the reflector on the reflector inner side. The press-on spring bears against the edge<br>
- 4 -<br>
of the lamp mounting opening and defines a first point of contact between the lamp cap and the edge of the lamp mounting opening. The support sleeve bears against the. edge of the mounting opening below the second and third reference noses, and defines two further points of contact between the lamp cap and Che edge of the lamp mounting opening. The depressions in the outer side of the support sleeve, and/or the cutouts in the support sleeve are arranged such that they are arranged at the same level as the outer edge of the edge of the lamp mounting opening. These measures ensure that the previously named outer edge is arranged free from contact with the lamp cap, and that any possible formation of burrs on the outer edge causes no maladjustment of the lamp in the mounting opening, designed as a lampholder, of the reflector.<br>
III. Description of the preferred exemplary embodiment<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with the aid of a preferred exemplary embodiment.  In the&gt;<br>
drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the preferred exemplary embodiment of the lamp according to the invention and having a reflector, partially sectioned,<br>
Figure 2 shows a top view of the connection between the support sleeve of the lamp of Figure 1 and the lamp .mounting opening of the reflector, with the lamp inserted in the reflector, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross section through the lamp cap and the reflector, along the line of section A-A of Figure 2.<br>
- 5 -<br>
The preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention is a single-filament halogen incandescent lamp which is provided for use in a motor vehicle headlight.  This lamp has a vitreous, essentially cylindrical lamp bulb 10 with a pinch foot 10a sealed in a gas-tight fashion. The dome 10b of the lamp bulb 10 is provided with a light-absorbing coating. Serving as light source is an incandescent  filament 11,  which is  aligned parallel with the axis of the lamp bulb and connected in an electrically conducting fashion to two supply leads 12, 13 which are led out of the pinch foot 10a and comprise molybdenum wire. The pinch foot 10a of the lamp bulb 10 is fixed in a metal holder which comprises a cup-shaped holder part 14a,  the intermediate ring 14 e and the ring-shaped support sleeve 14b.  In addition to the metal holder 14a, 14b, the lamp cap also has a plastic cap  part  15  which  is  provided  with  the  electric terminals 16,  17 of the lamp and in which the ring-shaped  metal  support  sleeve  14b  is  anchored.  The support sleeve 14b has three reference noses 14c, lying in one plane, and a press-on spring 14d for mounting the  lamp  in  the  reflector  20  of  a motor vehicle headlight. The sealing of the reflector 20 is performed by means of a silicone sealing ring 19 which bears against the outer wall 20b of the reflector 20 and against the plastic cap part 15. Figure 1 represents the  structure  of  the  lamp  in  accordance  with  the preferred exemplary embodiment, and its insertion in a headlight.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show details of the arrangement of the lamp in the reflector 20 of the motor vehicle headlight. The three reference noses 14c engage in the mounting opening 21, designed as a lampholder, of the reflector 20, and bear against the inner side 20a of the reflector 20. They 14c are distributed equidistantly over the circumference of the ring-shaped support sleeve 14b. The press-on spring 14d of the support sleeve 14b is arranged below a first reference<br>
- 6 -<br>
nose 14c and bears resiliently against the edge 22 of the lamp mounting opening 21. The outer side of the support sleeve 14b respectively has a depression 14 f below the other two reference noses 14c. The depressions 14f are respectively arranged at a distance of approximately 2:4 nun below the reference noses 14c. The reflector wall has a thickness of 3 mm in the region of the lamp mounting opening 21. The inner edge 22al, which delimits the edge 22 on the reflector inner side 20a, and the outer edge 22a2, which delimits the edge 22 on the reflector outer side 20b, therefore have a spacing of 3 mm. The depressions 14f in the outer side of the support sleeve 14b are arranged at the same level as the outer edge 22a2 of the opening edge 21. In the region of the two above-named other reference noses 14c, the edge 22 of the lamp mounting opening 21 of the reflector 20 respectively has a prismatic bearing surface 22a. The outer side of -the support sleeve 14b of the lamp cap bears against these two prismatic bearing surfaces 22a with a clamping fit. The clamping action is produced by means of the press-on spring 14d. The contact surfaces between the support sleeve 14b and bearing surfaces 22a are located below the reference noses 14c and above the depressions 14f. Because of the depressions 14f, the outer edge 22a2, possibly affected by a burr, of the -edge 22 of the mounting opening 21 is arranged free from contact with the lamp cap and, in particular, with the support sleeve 14b.<br>
The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment described in more detail above. For example, instead of the two depressions 14f, the support sleeve 14b can also have in its outer wall a groove which is in the shape of a ring segment and is arranged in the region of the prismatic bearing surfaces 22e at the same level as the outer edge 22a2. Instead of depressions 14f, the support sleeve 14b can also have cutouts, that is to say holes in the support sleeve wall.<br>
