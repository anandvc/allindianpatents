				<td>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
End-users are becoming increasingly aware That<br>
undesirable skin conditions can be caused or aggravated by<br>
inherent, skin oil or by oils found in various products<br>
including cosmetics. one of the most undesirable skin<br>
conditions is acne.<br>
Prior art skin cleansing compositions have<br>
attempted to absorb oil and debris from skin surfaces<br>
These skin cieansing compositions can be described<br>
variously as oil-based, emulsion-type or water-based<br>
surfactant systems.<br>
Oil-based skin cleansing compositions contain a<br>
mixture of oils and esters. These compositions can be an<br>
irritant particularly when used on sensitive skin, because<br>
they may contain surfactants and because they tend to<br>
leave a greasy film over the skin. Emulsion-type skin<br>
cleansvng compositions are usually based on a class of<br>
surfactants known as emulsifiers. Any surfactants can be<br>
irritant, especially when used around the eyes.<br>
Oil-in-water emulsions are the most common, but<br>
water-in-oil emulsions are also available. Emulsion-type<br>
preparations contain oil and/or waxes and tend to leave a<br>
greasy feel on the skin.<br>
To alleviate this problem, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,480,633 attempts to provide for an aqueous skin rinse<br>
formulation for soap and surfactant residues. The claim is<br>
made that the facial rinse provided by the invencion is<br>
effective in reducing the deposition of soap and<br>
surfactants from the skin.<br>
There exists products which attempt to visibly<br>
control oily facial shine via oil-absorbing powders. These<br>
products do not possess antiseptic properties, and<br>
furthermore, are aesthetically unappealing by virtue of<br>
their viscous, chalky appearance, and/or lack of<br>
homogeneity.<br>
The present invention provides for non-oily<br>
leave-on skin cleansing compositions having astringent,<br>
antiseptic, oil-stripping properties with long lasting oil<br>
control.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for leave-on skin<br>
cleanser compositions having astringent, antiseptic and<br>
oil stripping properties. The compositions comprise as<br>
essential ingredients an oil-absorbing powder, thickening<br>
and keratolytic agents and alcohol. The compositions of<br>
the invention also comprise water, fragrances, colorants,<br>
an emollient and a humectant. The oil-absorbing powder is<br>
in an amount from about 1 to about 3 wt %, the thickening<br>
agent in an amount from about 0.1 to about 1 wt. %, the<br>
keratolytic agent in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2<br>
wt. % and the alcohol in an amount from about 10 to about<br>
40 wt. %.<br>
The invention also provides for a method of<br>
preparing the compositions of the invention. The oil-<br>
adsorbing powder and the thickening agent are admixed in<br>
water to form a suspension. The pH of the suspension is<br>
adjusted to from about 3 to about 4. The keratolytic agent<br>
is dissolved in alcohol to form an acid-alcohol mixture<br>
and the pH of the mixture adjusted to from about 3 to<br>
about 4. The suspension and the acid-alcohol mixture are<br>
combined and the pH adjusted to from about 3 to about 4. A<br>
humectant is admixed with the suspension and an emollient<br>
is mixed with the acid-alcohol mixture.<br>
The invention further provides for a method for<br>
cleansing the skin. The method comprises the step of<br>
applying to the skin an effective amount of the<br>
compositions of the invention, allowing the applied<br>
composition to dry completely and then leaving the dried<br>
compositions on the skin area for continual oil absorbancy<br>
and shine control.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED-EMBODIMENTS<br>
The novel compositions of this invention provide<br>
for an aqueous topical formulation having astringent,<br>
antiseptic and oil stripping properties.<br>
The novel compositions comprise four classes of<br>
essential ingredients in a suitable carrier. The four<br>
classes are generally defined as oil absorbing powders,<br>
thickening agents, keratolytic agents and a lower alkyl<br>
alcohol.<br>
The oil absorbing powder is any substance which<br>
is capable of removing oil secretions from the skin.<br>
Exemplary oil absorbing powders include cornstarch,<br>
oatmeal, talc, silica coated mica, titanium dioxide coated<br>
mica and hectorite type-clay. The oil absorbing powder is<br>
present in an amount from about 1 to about 3 wt. %,<br>
preferably in an amount from about 1.8 to about 2.2 wt. %.<br>
The term "hectorite-type clay" as used herein<br>
includes both naturally occurring and synthetic hectorite<br>
clays such as those available commercially from Southern<br>
Clay Products, Inc., under the trade name Laponite XLS and<br>
XLG. They are already known in the art and are used in<br>
the personal care and cosmetic areas, namely in such<br>
products as shampoos, face masks, moisturizing creams and<br>
makeups. Some of the advantages of Laponite include<br>
improving the application and feel of lotions and creams,<br>
stabilizing emulsions, suspensions and solutions, reducing<br>
the oily feel of emulsions and acting as an absorbent for<br>
grease and oil. Laponite is a preferred oil-absorbing<br>
powder because it not only contributes to a better feel of<br>
the composition but provides immediate visible perception<br>
of absorption of skin oil.<br>
The compositions of this invention also include<br>
a thickening agent. Exemplary thickening agents include<br>
those made from bentonite, carbomer, carrageenan,<br>
ozokerite, dextrin, gelatin and a cellulose resin such as<br>
xanthan gum. The thickening agent is present in an amount<br>
from about 0.1 to about 1 wt. %, preferably in an amount<br>
from about 0.23 to about 0.27 wt. %.<br>
Xanthan gum is available commercially under the<br>
trade name Keltrol. Xanthan gum is a high molecular weight<br>
polysaccharide which has been used in food and<br>
pharmaceutical applications. As provided commercially,<br>
xanthan gum particles typically range in size from 75 to<br>
250 microns. Xanthan gum is a preferred thickening agent<br>
for maximum suspension activity with minimal viscosity.<br>
Compositions of this invention also include a<br>
keratolytic agent. Exemplary agents are salicylic acid,<br>
boric acid and methyl salicylate. The keratolytic agent is<br>
present in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2 wt. %,<br>
preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5 wt. %.<br>
Salicylic acid is known as a topical keratolytic<br>
agent and externally as an antiseptic and antifungal<br>
agent. Salicylic acid acts as an astringent and<br>
accelerates the removal of horny cells by decreasing their<br>
stickiness or cohesion. Salicylic acid is a preferred<br>
keratolytic agent as it combines maximum efficacy with<br>
antisepsis while offering ease of solubilization.<br>
Alcohol is an essential ingredient on the novel<br>
compositions of the invention, particularly lower alkyl<br>
alcohols. Exemplary alcohols are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl<br>
alcohol and mixtures thereof. The alcohol is suitable as a<br>
vehicle for the keratolytic agent and acts as an<br>
antiseptic and astringent. The alcohol is present in the<br>
compositions in an amount from about 10 to about 40 wt. %,<br>
preferably from about 20 to about 30 wt. %.<br>
In addition to the essential ingredients, the<br>
compositions of this invention can also contain<br>
nonessential ingredients. These are generally humectants,<br>
emollients, colorants, fragrances and the like.<br>
Emollients which can be included in the<br>
compositions of the invention function by their ability to<br>
remain on the skin surface or in the stratum corneum to<br>
act as lubricants, to reduce flaking, and to improve the<br>
skin appearance. Typical emollients include fatty esters,<br>
fatty alcohols, mineral oil, polyether siloxane copolymers<br>
and the like. Examples of emollients include but are not<br>
limited to PPG-15 stearyl ether, PPG-10 cetyl ether,<br>
steareth-10, oleth-8 and PPG-4 lauryl ether. The emollient<br>
is preferably PPG-15 stearyl ether and can be present in<br>
an amount up to about 5 wt %, preferably up to about 2.5<br>
wt. %.<br>
Humectants of the polyhydric alcohol-type can be<br>
included in the compositions of the invention. The<br>
humectants aid in increasing the effectiveness of the<br>
emollient, reduce scaling, stimulate removal of built-up<br>
scale and improve skin feel. Typical polyhydric alcohols<br>
include glycerol (also known as glycerin), polyalkylene<br>
glycols, and more preferably alkelene polyols and their<br>
derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene<br>
glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and<br>
derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol,<br>
hexylene glycol, 1,3-dibutylene glycol, 1,2,6,-<br>
hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol<br>
and mixtures thereof. For best results, the humectant is<br>
preferably 1,3-dibutylene glycol and can be present in an<br>
amount up to about 5 wt. %, preferably up to about 2.5 wt.<br>
%.<br>
Additional nonessential components include well<br>
known colorants such as FD&amp;C Blue #1 and D&amp;C Yellow #10<br>
and fragrances such as eucalyptus oil, camphor synthetic,<br>
peppermint oil and clove oil. For best results, colorants<br>
may be present as needed, in an amount up to about 1 wt.<br>
%, preferably up to about 0.5 wt. %. Fragrances may be<br>
present as needed in an amount up to about 0.5 wt. %,<br>
preferably up to about 0.36 wt. %.<br>
According to the present invention, the oil<br>
absorbing powder, thickening agent and keratolytic agent<br>
are admixed with a suitable vehicle or carrier system.<br>
Preferred carriers include water for the oil-absorbing<br>
powder and the thickening agent. The water is admixed in<br>
an amount as needed and the keratolytic agent is admixed<br>
with the alcohol. The nonessential components are admixed<br>
where needed in a suitable vehicle or carrier system.<br>
Preferred carriers include water for the humectant and<br>
alcohol for the emollient and fragrances.<br>
The oil-absorbing powder and thickening agent<br>
are first admixed in water to form a suspension.<br>
Optionally, a humectant can also be admixed. Following<br>
admixing, the pH is adjusted to from about 3 to about 4<br>
using art-known acids. A preferred acid is citric acid.<br>
The keratolytic agent is admixed in alcohol to<br>
form an acid-alcohol mixture. Optionally, the emollient<br>
and fragrances can also be admixed with the acid-alcohol<br>
mixture. Following admixing, the pH is adjusted to from<br>
about 3 to about 4 using art-known bases. A preferred base<br>
is potassium hydroxide.<br>
The water suspension and the acid-alcohol<br>
mixture are combined. Optionally, colorants can be admixed<br>
and the pH adjusted to from about 3 to about 4, preferably<br>
to from about 3.3 to about 3.5.<br>
The novel compositions of the invention result<br>
in a skin cleansing astringent, antiseptic and oil-<br>
stripping formulation. The formulation is in the form of<br>
an aqueous suspension which can be applied as a leave-on<br>
skin cleanser. The compositions of the invention are<br>
applied to the face (or other skin surface) and the<br>
applied composition is allowed to dry completely. The<br>
dried composition is left on the skin surface for<br>
continual oil absorbancy and shine control.<br>
The invention will now be further described with<br>
reference to the following example:<br>
The abbreviation "q.s." is a standard dispensing<br>
nomenclature which means "as needed" or "as sufficient".<br>
Phase A:<br>
Laponite is dispersed in the water at room<br>
temperature and mixed for a sufficient time until<br>
dispersed. Xanthan gum is then added to the dispersion<br>
also at room temperature and mixed therein for a<br>
sufficient time until the dispersion thickens.<br>
Alternatively, xanthan gum can be first dispersed and then<br>
the Laponite added. Optionally, 1,3-dibutylene glycol can<br>
be added during dispersion formation. The pH of the<br>
dispersion is adjusted with an acid to a pH of from about<br>
3 to about 4.<br>
Phase B:<br>
The salicylic acid and the alcohol are mixed at<br>
room temperature until the acid dissolves in the alcohol.<br>
Optionally, PPG-15 stearyl ether and the fragrances can be<br>
added. The pH is. adjusted with a base to from about 3 to<br>
about 4.<br>
Phase A+B<br>
Phases A and B are mixed and optionally,<br>
colorants can be added. The pH can be adjusted by addition<br>
of an acid or a base where appropriate to a pH of from<br>
about 3.3 to about 4. The target pH at the time of<br>
manufacture is about 3.5.<br>
While this specification describes       the<br>
principles of the present invention, it is to       be<br>
understood that other aspects, advantages       and<br>
