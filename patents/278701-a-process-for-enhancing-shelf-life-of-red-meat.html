				<td>This invention relates to a process for enhancing shelf life of red meat FIELD OF INVENTION: -<br>
The invention particularly relates to a process for enhancing shelf life of red meat exemplified by pork, beef, veal, lamb and goat. More particularly it provides a process that maintains the newly slaughtered meat fresh and unspoiled for extended period by arresting or retarding growth of microorganisms including but not limiting to bacteria, fungi, viruses pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic. Still more particularly, the process of this invention helps extending the shelf life of meat under chilling as well as at ambient temperature conditions. Further, the process extends the shelf life and robustness of the meat without negatively affecting the appearance and without causing substantial organoleptic depreciation of meat. An attempt has been made to use naturally occurring, &amp; physiologically acceptable components that are considered as generally regarded as safe (GRAS) there by maintaining taste properties and nutritional values of the meat intact. Additionally the components used also help preventing meat juice from flowing out. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Meat is a highly perishable commodity compared to other foods. It shows visible signs of spoilage within 16-18 hrs and 6-8 days under ambient and chilling temperature conditions respectively. During or after slaughter the meat may becomes contaminated with undesirable microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. It is also likely that the meat is already contaminated through food chain reaction or some other means even before slaughter. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for the spoilage of meat are: favourable pH, redox potential, highly nutritious composition, water activity and storage<br>
ambience as well as temperature etc. Hence, suitable preservative treatments are required to<br>
either delay or arrest the microbial and chemical spoilage.<br>
In accordance with the present practices meats are rapidly frozen or refrigerated<br>
immediately after slaughter and transported in frozen or refrigerated conditions to the<br>
destination. This necessitates the need for frozen storage at -180Â°C and cold chain from<br>
slaughter onwards, till it reaches consumer, which is quite impossible with the present<br>
energy scenario. Apart from this, the freezing/frozen storage affects the eating quality of<br>
mutton due to excessive drip, textual alterations, fat rancidity etc.<br>
US patent No.6521275 describes the use of mixture of carbon monoxide and helium as<br>
preservant for meat. It requires special type of packaging systems and also low temperature<br>
storage, which adds on to the cost.<br>
In order to improve the problems and disadvantages inherent in the conventional methods<br>
there have been proposed a variety of methods for preservation &amp; enhancing shelf life of<br>
meat.<br>
The prior art known to the inventor includes UK Patent No. 209158, which advocates<br>
hardening the meat superficially by exposing the same to formaldehyde for increased<br>
storage ability. The product may have low profile acceptability by the consumer.<br>
Australian Patent No. 430208 teaches storing meat under atmosphere deficient in oxygen<br>
(not more than 7%) under chilled conditions. Apart being cost extensive the process appears<br>
to be not feasible on commercial scale.<br>
Japanese patent No. JP3049644 describes a process that involves preserving meat using<br>
fermented soya bean paste (MISO KOJI) usually for 1-2 weeks. The patent claims that the<br>
meat is storable at normal temperature. The process appears to be cumbersome, difficult to<br>
use on commercial scale, and interdependent on fermentation of soya bean paste.<br>
Japanese Patent JP 62236470 discloses a process for preserving meat with SAKE lees that<br>
are steamed and softened.<br>
US Patent 6,824,802 advises maintaining low pH condition  i.e. between 3 to 5 so as to<br>
avoid spoilage due to microbial growth. The acidulant is chosen from unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids like citric, fumaric malic acetic tartaric. However, this reduces the<br>
acceptance by the consumers.<br>
According to US Patent 5,354,568, the carcasses are treated with trialkali orthophosphates<br>
at pH 11.5 to retard bacterial growth without appreciably changing the colour of the meat.<br>
US Patent No. 5,939,112 basically relates to processed meat and meat products.   The<br>
animal meat is treated by a solution containing salt and alkali in high concentration. The<br>
salt content varies from 0.2.to5.0 parts and alkali ranges from 0.1 to 6.0 parts by wt. each<br>
with respect to 100 parts by wt. of meat.<br>
One of the most relevant known processes described in US patent No. 4416909 makes use<br>
of a combination of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium carbonate and sodium metabisulfite to<br>
prevent meat and poultry. The following are the limitation/disadvantages of the above<br>
reported preservatives:<br>
They are chemical in nature.<br>
They interact with vitamins specially thiamine.<br>
They are suitable only for storing at chilled condition.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a process, which provides solution to the problems of the<br>
existing art. Further the process should be simple, feasible at industrial level, cost effective<br>
and eco-friendly. It is imperative to use a natural, safe, physiologically acceptable<br>
component to preserve the red meat particularly, under chilling and ambient temperature<br>
conditions for an extended period without affecting organoleptic properties of the meat. As<br>
a result of extensive study including sensory tests, it is found that clove oil, food grade<br>
ethanolic spice extract of sage, thyme, cinnamon, which are natural ingredients can be<br>
successfully employed to enhance the shelf life of red meat. Hence, an attempt has been<br>
made to enhance the shelf life of the red meat, using natural preservatives as herein<br>
mentioned above at normal as well as low temperature without adversely affecting the<br>
physico-chemical and microbiological quality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a process for enhancing<br>
shelf life of red meat<br>
The other object of this invention is to provide a process for enhancing shelf life of red<br>
meat exemplified by pork, beef, veal, lamb and goat obviating the drawbacks of the prior<br>
art substantially.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process that maintains the newly<br>
slaughtered meat fresh and unspoiled for extended period by arresting or retarding growth<br>
of microorganisms including but not limiting to bacteria, fungi, and viruses.<br>
Yet other object of this invention is to provide a process that helps extending the shelf life<br>
of meat under chilling as well as at ambient temperature conditions.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process, which extends the shelf life and<br>
robustness of the meat without negatively affecting the appearance (colour, texture and<br>
flavour) and without causing substantial organoleptic depreciation of meat.<br>
Still other object of this invention is to provide a process that uses naturally occurring, &amp;<br>
physiologically acceptable components, as herein above mentioned, that are considered as<br>
'generally regarded as safe' (GRAS) there by maintaining taste properties and nutritional<br>
values of the meat intact by preventing meat juice from flowing out. Meat thus treated using<br>
ingredients in a well-balanced manner meets the threshold of acceptability by the consumer.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process to preserve raw meat wherein<br>
use of chemicals and high concentration of salts and or acids is eliminated.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process to preserve raw mutton<br>
both under chilling as well as ambient temperature conditions in a cost effective manner.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a process to preserve raw meat both under<br>
chilling as well as ambient temperature condition by which the meat need not be frozen for<br>
transportation there by eliminates need for stringent operating conditions and skilled<br>
personnel. Also the process does not requires sophisticated machineries.<br>
The term red meat applies to whole meat such as cuts of meat as well as whole carcasses.<br>
Robustness refers to the ability to offer an effective anti-microbial effect during storage.<br>
The enhanced or extended shelf life refers to relative ability to increase life time when<br>
stored under microbiologically sensitive conditions of storage as compared to protected<br>
conditions.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for enhancing shelf life of red meat<br>
comprises contacting the surfaces of pre-cleaned meat with conventional acidulant selected<br>
from carboxylic acids, their salts or source their of in solution form, followed by applying<br>
physiologically acceptable components that are considered as 'generally regarded as safe'<br>
(GRAS) and selected from clove oil, food grade ethanolic spice extract of sage, thyme,<br>
cinnamon.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention is that the red meat such as carcasses may be<br>
surface cleaned using potable water preferably under pressure of 10 psi to remove dart<br>
completely. Further, it is preferable to drain the excess water prior to contacting with a<br>
mixture of acids.<br>
In other embodiment of this invention contacting may be carried out by physically applying<br>
the acidulant, mechanically spraying the acidulant on the surface, dipping the carcasses or<br>
organs in the acidulant, preferably dipping the meat in the acidulant.<br>
Further, lactic acid and glacial acetic acid or their salts in combination may be used as<br>
acidulant preferably in 1:1 ratio and the individual component used may be lto 2 % with<br>
respect to acid contents. The contacting may be conducted so as to achieve the drop in<br>
surface pH to a level ranging from 3.5 to 3.8 or for about 5 to 10 seconds. The meat may<br>
preferably be surface dried by any conventional methods such as blowing air, or draining<br>
water by hanging vertically before applying the physiologically acceptable and GRAS<br>
components such as herein before described.<br>
The physiologically acceptable and GRAS components selected from clove oil, food grade<br>
ethanolic spice extract of sage, thyme, cinnamon preferably clove oil may be applied<br>
physically or mechanically by spraying the meat uniformly. The clove oil used may be<br>
commercial grade.<br>
The physiologically acceptable and GRAS components selected from clove oil, food grade<br>
ethanolic spice extract of sage, thyme, cinnamon may be used in solution form using food<br>
grade ethanol. The clove oil used may be 5 to 20% v/v ethanolic solution. The meat may be<br>
applied with ehanolic clove oil in the ratio of 10:ltol0: 2 w/v.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
According to present invention a process has been provided to preserve red meat preferably<br>
raw mutton (carcasses) or parts thereof to maintain the newly slaughtered meat fresh and<br>
unspoiled for extended period by arresting or retarding growth of microorganisms including<br>
pathogens at 25Â±2Â°C and at 5Â±2Â°C. The process comprising the following steps:<br>
Surface sanitization of raw mutton: The carcasses are washed thoroughly in potable water<br>
under pressure (10 psi) to remove surface dart completely. Washed carcasses are dipped in<br>
a solution containing about 1-2% each of lactic acid and glacial acetic acid at 60-70Â°C for<br>
5-10 seconds, so that the surface pH drops in the range of 3.5-3.8. The mutton to dip<br>
solution ratio is maintained at around 1:3. After acid treatment the carcass was hanged<br>
vertically for 1 hour to drain excess water or surface dried using air blower preferably the<br>
water is allowed to drain out by hanging.<br>
Treatment of the raw mutton with clove oil: The carcasses are subjected to clove oil spray<br>
treatment as follows: 5-20% solution of clove oil is prepared in distilled alcohol (V/V). The<br>
carcasses from step (a) are sprayed uniformly with clove oil solution in the ratio of 10:1 to<br>
10:2 (W/V), which is applied twice in an interval of 1 hour.<br>
After the above treatment the carcass was stored for 4 days at 25Â±2Â°C (RH 85Â±2%) and one<br>
month at 5Â±2Â°C (RH 80Â±5%). During the storage period, the microbiological, chemical and<br>
sensory changes were monitored and the product was found to retain the organoleptic and<br>
nutritional properties as illustrated in Tables 1 to 3.<br>
Table 1 describes the Sensory attributes of meat treated in accordance with the process of this invention when stored at ambient temperature. Table 2 shows effect of clove oil on microbiological profile of meat at ambient temperature. Table 3 indicates the effect of clove oil on cadavarine and biogenic amines index of raw meat during storage at ambient temperature. Lactic acid helps in bleaching the colour and keeping the texture of the meat. Use of saturated carboxylic acids as against unsaturated acids being used in the prior art may help in regulating pH in effective manner particularly while maintaining the texture and taste of the meat. Ethanolic clove oil or other spice extract maintains the acceptability by the sensory glands.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by non-limiting examples. Though the process of this invention is illustrated with reference to clove oil it can be extended to other components as herein before described. EXAMPLE 1:<br>
The mutton carcass weighing 6 kg was washed in potable water under pressure (8 psi). The washed carcass was hanged vertically for 30-40 minutes to remove water content. The carcass was dipped in a solution containing 1.5% each of lactic and glacial acetic acid at 65Â°C for 8 seconds. Then the carcass was hanged vertically for 50 minutes. The carcass was subjected to clove oil solution spray treatment (5% V/V clove oil in ethyl alcohol was sprayed on carcass in the ratio 10:1 W/V). EXAMPLE 2:<br>
The mutton carcass weighing 8 kg was washed in potable water under (5 psi). The washed carcass was hanged vertically for 30-40 minutes to remove water content. The carcass was dipped in a solution containing 1.75% each of lactic and glacial acetic at 70Â°C for 8<br>
seconds. Then the carcass was hanged vertically for 50 minutes. The carcass was subjected to clove oil solution spray treatment (10% V/V clove oil in ethyl alcohol was sprayed on carcass in the ratio 10:1 W/V). EXAMPLE 3:<br>
The mutton carcass weighing 10.5 kg was washed in potable water under (8 psi). The washed carcass was hanged vertically for 30-40 minutes to remove water content. The carcass was dipped in a solution containing 1.25% each of lactic and glacial acetic at 68Â°C for 9 seconds. Then the carcass was hanged vertically for 50 minutes. The carcass was subjected to clove oil solution spray treatment (15% V/V clove oil in ethyl alcohol was sprayed on carcass in the ratio 10:1 W/V).<br>
