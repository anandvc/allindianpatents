[0021] Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in the following Examples. All fractions and percentages set forth below in the Examples are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
[0022] General Sample Preparation Procedure: The level of silver-containing copolymer in the bath solution was maintained at 181 ppm silver to provide 300 ppm of silver on the dried fabric. The bath was made using tap water that was pH adjusted using 28% NH4OH to a pH of 9.5-9.9, prior to the addition of the silver-containing copolymer. Other ingredients were added at appropriate levels - the solution was mixed using a standard air mixer until homogeneous. The substrate to be treated was passed through the bath solution and then passed through two nips rolls to express excess solution. The treated substrate is tentered and dried 2-3 min @ 149-163°C. The treated, dried substrate is washed as noted, and then submitted for Ag content and/or efficacy testing.<br>
[0023] Samples were prepared with a silver-containing copolymer which had 45 wt% BA monomer units, 45 wt% VI monomer units and 10% AA monomer units, and which contained 11% silver, and/or with the epoxy resins/polyurethanes indicated in the tables below added to the treatment water. The amount of epoxy resin was measured in equivalents epoxy group/equivalent of VI unit in the silver-containing copolymer. The fabric substrate used for the testing was 100% polyester knit fabric, 3.5 oz/yd (125 g/m ) basis weight.<br>
