Alternatively, the distillate fractions above may be treated with an appropriate molecular sieve. In addition, the azeotropic distillate fraction may be separated by rectification, with a suitable rectification column, into its component alcohol or alcohol-rich fraction and the solvent fraction, which solvent may be returned to the reaction system to recycle it, thereby the reaction equilibrium may be effectively shifted toward the desired product.<br>
