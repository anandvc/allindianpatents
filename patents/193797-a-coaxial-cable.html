				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a coaxial cable having a foam insulating layer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a coaxial cable having a foam insulating layer prepared from an insulating material.<br>
Traditionally, insulating wires having a foam insulating layer on<br>
conductors, which is formed by foam extrusion of a polymer composition,<br>
have been widely used. The polymer composition used for such foam<br>
extrusion comprises, for example, a polyolefm resin such as polyethylene, a<br>
thermally	decomposable	compound	such	as	4,4'-<br>
oxybisbenzenesulfonylhydrazide (OBSH) and azodicarbonamide (ADCA) as a nucleator, and a foaming agent such as chlorofluorocarbon.<br>
When a composition containing a polyolefm resin and OBSH as a nucleator is used, however, water is produced during thermal decomposition of OBSH and remains in foamed articles, which in turn adversely affects transmission performance and the like. To avoid this, the obtained tbam insulating layers need to be dried, for example, vacuum drying, which is problematic from industrial aspects.<br>
When a composition containing ADCA as a nucleator is used, moreover, a residue from thermal decomposition of ADCA, such as biurea, cyanuric acid and urazol, is produced to cause dielectric loss in high frequency regions due to the polarization thereof which noticeably increases the dissipation factor (hereinafter to be referred to as tan 5) of the obtained foam insulating layer, thereby degrading the electric property of the insulating layer. The decomposition residue<br><br>
also causes high water absorption of the foam insulating layer, and the foamed article therefore requires storage in a low humidity atmosphere.<br>
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 348141/1992 discloses a composition for foam extrusion which comprises a base resin containing a polyolefin resin capable of heat-melt extrusion, and a low polarity boron compound powder non-decoraposable at a foaming temperature as a nucleator.<br>
Japanese Patent Application No. 12983/1995 discloses a composition for foam extrusion which comprises a base resin containing a polyolefin resin capable of heat-melt extrusion and a specific boron nitride as a nucleator.<br>
The composition containing boron nitride provides a foamed article far superior to foamed articles obtained by conventional foamable compositions containing a known nucleator such as ADCA, in various properties, specifically electric property (e.g., tan 5). Yet, such foamed article also has defects in that it has larger cell diameter than in the foamed articles obtained from conventional materials to disqualify itself for such use as requires mechanical strength or hardness, and that it is costly.<br>
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 279739/1990 and 64335/1991 teach a method for producing a foamed article which comprises heating a mixture of a thermoplastic resin and a fluorocarbon powder or a nucleator for plasticization, and adding a foaming agent.<br>
The above-mentioned two gazettes relate to a foamed article for thermal insulation and do not suggest a foamable composition (insulating material) suitable for forming a foam insulating layer of coaxial cables, which is capable of producing a foamed article particularly superior in electric properties, and a coaxial cable having an insulating layer obtained from said composition.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an insulating material for economical coaxial cables, which is capable of producing foamed articles having fine and uniform cells and a high expansion ratio, and which obviates drying steps of foamed articles.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a coaxial cable having an insulating layer superior in electric properties, which layer being obtained from said insulating material.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing the above-mentioned coaxial cable.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a coaxial cable comprising a foam insulating layer prepared from an insulating material for coaxial cables, which material comprising a polyolefin resin heat-melt extrudable and a fluororesin powder as a nucleator, and being foam extrudable in the presence of a foaming agent, wherein the polyolefin resin is a high density polyethylene, a low density polyethylene or a mixture of a high density polyethylene and a low density polyethylene.<br>
The insulating material of the said coaxial cable contains a foaming agent. The polyolefin resin includes a high density polyethylene, a low density polyethylene or a mixture of a high density polyethylene and a low density polyethylene. The fluororesin powder having an average particle size of 0.1 - 100 \xm, is a member selected from the group consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene powder, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer powder and ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer powder and the fluororesin powder is added in a proportion of 0.01 - 10 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin resin.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of the production apparatus of the coaxial cable of the present invention, wherein 1 is a conductor supply<br><br>
device, 2 is a preliminary heater, 3 is a pump, 4 is a primary extruder, 5 is a secondary extruder, 6 is a die, 8 is a conductor and 9 is an extruder head.<br>
The insulating material of the present invention comprises, as a base resin, a polyolefm resin capable of heat-melt extrusion.<br>
Examples of the polyolefm resin capable of heat-melt extrusion include polyethylenes [e.g., high density polyethylene (HDPE), middle density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and a mixture of HDPE and LDPEj,   polypropylene, and propylene-ethylene<br><br>
copolymer wherein propylene and ethylene have been randomly or block copolymerized. In particular, polyethylene, specifically HOPE and a mixture of HDPE and LDPE, are preferably used for superior expansion ratio. The proportion of HDPE and LDPE in the mixture of HDPE and LDPE is generally 10-900 parts by weight, preferably 12.5-400 parts by weight, and more preferably 100-400 parts by weight of LDPE relative to 100 parts by weight of HDPE.<br>
As used herein, LDPE means those having a density of not less than 0.910 g/cm^ and not more than 0.925 g/cm^; MDPE means those having a density exceeding 0.925 g/cm^ and not more than 0.940 g/cm^; and HDPE means those having a density exceeding 0.940 g/cra^ and not more than 0.965 g/cm^<br>
The preferable range of melt flow rate (hereinafter to be abbreviated as MFR) of the polyolefin resin to be used in the present invention is, for example, 0.5-10 g/10 min, preferably 0.6-8 g/10 min for polyethylene, and 1-20 g/10 min, preferably 1.5-15 g/10 min for polypropylene, wherein MFR is determined according to JIS K 7210. The determination conditions are load 2.16 kg, temperature 190'C for polyethylene and load 2.16 kg, temperature 230'C for polypropylene.<br>
The base resin may contain, besides the above-mentioned polyolefin resin, other resins such as polystyrene to the extent that the accomplishment of the object of the present invention is not prevented. When other resins are added, the content thereof is preferably not more than 20% by weight of the base resin.<br>
In the present invention, fluororesin powder is used as a nucleator of the insulating material for coaxial cable.<br>
Examples of the fluororesin powder include, but not limited to, powders of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer (PFA), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE), tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP), tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) and chlorotrifluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer (ECTFE), with preference given to PTFE powder, PFA<br><br>
ppwder and ETFE powder, and particular preference given to PTFE powder.<br>
The average particle size of the fluororesin powder is not particularly limited, but it is preferably 0.1 - TOO ym,  more preferably 0.5 - 50μm in terms of uniformity of the cell and expansion ratio.<br>
The average particle size is determined by laser beam diffraction method (microtrack particle size analyzer). The particle size is determined by adding about 100 mg of a test sample (fluororesin powder) in an ethanol/water (1:1) solution, uniformly dispersing same in an ultrasonic washer (28 KHz) for 5 minutes, and subjecting the dispersion to the determination by a Laser Granulometer Model 715 (CILAS).<br>
While the shape of the fluororesin powder is not particularly limited, it is preferably spherical to achieve better uniformity of the cell and desired expansion ratio.<br>
The content of the fluororesin powder is subject to no particular limitation, but it is preferably 0.01 - 10 parts by weight, more preferably 0.02 - 0.2 part by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the base resin. When the content of the fluororesin powder is within this range, a formed article can have good appearance, a high expansion ratio and a suitable cell size.<br>
It is possible to add a nucleator other than fluororesin powder, which is conventionally known in the pertinent field, to the extent that the characteristic features of the present invention are not impaired. Examples of such nucleator include fine powder of inorganic compound such as boron nitride, alumina, zirconia and talc, and organic foamable compound such as ADCA and OBSH. When a nucleator other than fluororesin powder is used, the content thereof is preferably not more than 50% by weight of the nucleator as a whole.<br>
The foaming agent may be appropriately selected depending on the forming temperature, foaming conditions, method of foaming and the like. For example, a complete foam insulating layer is to be prepared simultaneously with forming, an inert gas may be used, such as nitrogen, carbon gas, helium and argon; hydrocarbon such as methane, propane.<br><br>
.butane and pentane; and halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichlorodifluoromethane, dichloromonofluoromethane, monochloro-difluoromethane, trichloromonofluoromethane, monochloropentafluoroethane and trichlorotrifluoroethane.<br>
Of these foaming agents, chlorofluorocarbon containing hydrogen atom (e.g., HCFC 22, HCFC 123, HCFC 124 and HCFC 142b), fluorocarbon without chlorine atom, and inert gas such as nitrogen, hydrocarbon gas and argon, are particularly preferable, since they can afford foamed articles having uniform and fine cells and a high expansion ratio. Being nondestructive to the ozon layer, they are also desirable from the aspects of environmental protection. Particularly preferred is argon.<br>
While the content of the foaming agent is not particularly limited, it is generally 0.2 - 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 - 10 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the base resin.<br>
The insulating material of the present invention may contain copper inhibitor, antioxidant and coloring agent on demand. The content of such additive is preferably 0.05 - 2.0 parts by weight, more preferably 0.1 - 1.0 part by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the base resin.<br>
The insulating material of the present invention is treated in the presence of a foaming agent when being delivered onto a conductor by extrusion of the material for forming an insulating layer on the conductor, whereby a foam insulating layer can be completed simultaneously with the forming.<br>
The foaming agent may be added to the insulating material before feeding into an extruder, or may be added from a foaming agent supply unit mounted on an extruder separately from the supply unit for the insulating material.<br>
One embodiment of the production apparatus of the coaxial cable of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
A mixture of a polyolefin resin and a nucleator, which was fed into the primary extruder 4, is melted in the primary extruder 4. A foaming agent is press injected into the primary extruder 4 via a pump 3 and<br><br>
thoroughly mixed with the melt. Then, the mixture of the polyolefin resin, the nucleator and the foaming agent sufficiently mixed in the primary extruder 4 is transferred to the secondary extruder 5.<br>
The extrusion temperature of the secondary extruder 5 is preferably adjusted to a temperature lower than that of the primary extruder 4 and slightly higher than the melt temperature of the polyolefin resin to be used. For example, when a mixture of HOPE and LDPE is used, the temperature and the pressure in the primary extruder 4 are preferably adjusted to 180 - 210°C, 50 - 150 atm; and the temperature and the pressure in the secondary extruder 5 are preferably adjusted to 130 -140r, 50 - 150 atm.<br>
The conductor 8 to be fed from the conductor supply 1 is preheated in a preliminary heater 2. The mixture in the secondary extruder 5 is extruded from the head 9 of the extruder into the die 6, passed through the axial core part of the die 6 and is press-adhered to the periphery of the conductor 8 thus fed. The mixture foams while adhering to the periphery of the conductor. Then, the foamed mixture is gradually cooled to form a foam insulating layer.<br>
The foam insulating layer thus formed is not necessarily in the final state and may undergo a subsequent treatment of, for example, crosslinking and post-foaming treatment.<br>
There is no particular limitation imposed on the structure of the coaxial cable of the present invention. In general terms, a foam insulating layer is formed from the insulating material of the present invention on the periphery of the inner conductor, an outer conductor layer is formed thereon, and a coating layer is further formed thereon.<br>
The thickness of the respective layers mentioned above is not limited. The diameter of the inner conductor is generally about 5-18 mm, that including the inner conductor and the insulating layer is about 11 - 45 mm, that further including the outer conductor is about 15 - 47 mm, and the outer diameter of the cable is about 17-51 mm.<br>
The conductor to be used in the present invention is preferably one made from a metallic material such as copper, aluminum and tin, with<br><br>
preference given to copper in terms of conductivity. The conductor may¬be a wire or a tube.<br>
The insulating material for coaxial cable of the present invention can afford a foamed article having fine and uniform cells, fine appearance and a high expansion ratio. The foamed article is superior in electric properties [small s   (effective dielectric constant) and tan d J  particularly small tan 6 ]. Addition of excess nucleator does not result in poor electric properties, but rather, in improved electric properties. The foamed article is advantageous in that it can be produced at lower costs than conventional articles.<br>
The foamed article prepared from the insulating material of the present invention has superior electric properties, and the material can be used for the insulating layer of communication antenna feeder line, ITV transmission line, CATV transmission line, and particularly for coaxial cable for high frequency waves of about 1.5 - 2.5 GHz.<br>
