Solution impregnation method is employed for manufacturing UD (Uni-Directional) prepreg tape. The scheme of rovings and prepreg transport in the UD prepreg production line is shown in figure 1. Manufacturing UD prepreg tape involves a complex series of operations, including unwinding of rovings, convergence of the rovings, impregnation with resin solutions, convective-radiative drying, and winding of prepreg along with release film onto the bobbins. The multiple rovings (2) unwind from the creels mounted in the stand (1) and pass through a convergent stand (3) and finally through a collimator (4) to form a free-rovings web of required width. The free-rovings web comes to the impregnation bath (5) containing the resin solution, inside which stationary rolls [(14) &amp; (15)] are mounted. Then impregnated tape is squeezed through dies (16) to form the tape to required thickness and width. The tape goes to the drying tower (6), where the organic solvent vapours are removed and the resin gelling occurs.<br>
Drawing of the tape with the required tension along the line is performed by means of the special puller device (7), which is equipped with a speed-stabilized drive. Release film (9) is fed from the roll to the driving shaft of the winding unit (8). Finally the prepreg along with the release film is wound on the bobbins mounted on the winding unit. Once the resin mix nears to exhaustion, fresh quantity of resin mix is fed Into the impregnation bath manually or automatically from feeding vessel.<br>
Now referring to figure 1 an apparatus for producing uni-directional prepreg tapes by solution impregnation method consists of the following units 1. Roving dispensing unit, 2. Roving convergence unit, 3. Impregnation unit,<br><br><br>
4. Drying unit, and 5. Winding unit. Now referring to figure 2 of the accompanying specification, which is the roving dispensing unit. This unit includes unique stacking of roving creels (10) which, dispenses the fiber through tensioners (11) at required speed and with out any overlapping of the said fibers. The said tensioners (11) impart required tension in each of roving. The creels are arranged on a creel mounting stand (1) so that roving do not get abraded with each other during their passage. The said creel stand (1) is designed to dispense ail fibers in perfect juxtaposition with out any climbing effect. The creel stand was designed to take care of varying number of roving required for manufacturing different tape width.<br>
Now referring to figure 3 and 4 of the specification, which is, roving convergence unit consists of convergence stand (3) and collimator (4) placed after the roving dispensing unit as shown in fig.2. The said roving unit brings all roving to required width and to impart required equal tension to all roving. The convergence stand and collimator (4) are arranged to avoid sharp transition in the fiber path and intermingling of the roving.<br>
The convergent stand (3) consists of a board having number of holes to which smooth bush (12) is attached. The bush may be made up of ceramic or any other suitable material. The function of the bush is to reduce the friction between the fibre and the bush, there by reducing the fiber damage.<br>
The said reed (13) is having a comb like structure consisting of a frame having number of smooth wires (chrome plated steel or any other suitable material) between which converged roving pass through. The inclination of the collimator with respect to process line is very important as it decides the final roving convergence. The angle should be preferably kept around 25 - 30° with respect to the process line.<br>
4<br><br>
Now referring to figure 5, which is the impregnation unit. The said unit consists of (14) Guide roller (15) Impregnation roller and (16) Squeeze die. The said unit impregnates the converged fibre with uniform resin pick up and gives the desired resin content very precisely. The resin/hardener/solvent ratio is accurately controlled to give desired viscosity suitable for achieving controlled resin pick up. Smooth Die (16) (chrome-plated steel or any other suitable material) used ensures required thickness, width and uniform resin distribution in the tapes. The resin level in the impregnation bath has to be maintained 30 - 60mm from the center of impregnation roller (15). It is to be noted that higher or lower resin level changes the resin pick up which in turn leads to variation of resin content in prepreg.<br>
The said guide roller (14) is to properly direct converged rovings to the impregnation roller (15). The impregnated roving passes through the sqeeze die (16) assembly. The said squeeze die assembly consists of two smooth blocks (chrome-plated steel or any other suitable material) which can adjusted by means of a spring mechanism to various width and thickness depending on the tape dimension required.<br>
Now referring to figure 8, which is Drying Unit, consists of Stand (24), Insulation block (25), Thermocouple (26), Embedded heating element (27) and Blower (28). As seen in figure 8 precisely controlled inverted U curing tower bakes prepreg tapes to the required degree of B-staging. The inverted U tower is mounted on stand (24). The said tower consists of multiple zones and each zone is having separate temperature controls. The number of zones can be varied to process various resin systems. The temperature in each zone is sensed by thermocouple (26) that is connected to controller. Each temperature zone is having insulation blocks (25) with embedded heating element (27). The power control provided maintains the desired temperature profile accurately with in ± 3° C. The temperature of each zone<br>
5<br><br>
can be varied from 40 to 250 °C that makes it possible to process various resin systems. Each zone has doors for conveniently passing rovings at start of the process and to take corrective action when required. Inside the curing tower, four anti-stick guide rollers are provided to direct the impregnated tape. Three blowers (28) are provided in the said tower for continuous removal of solvent during B-stage curing. Two glass windows are also , ^ provided to continuously monitor the prepreg quality.<br>
Now referring to figure! 6, which shows pulling roller assembly (7), which consists of Pulling rollers (17), Bearing housing (18), Nip adjusting screw (19). Figure 7 shows Spool (22) and Spool mounting stand (23). The prepreg along with the release film is wound on the said spool (22) mounted on the winding unit. Unique Speed-stabilized DC drive is provided both for puller device and final winding through a chain driving system. There is also a provision to incorporate AC speed control and timer belt drive mechanism instead of above said DC speed control and chain drive mechanism. This drive provides uniform winding of the tapes along with the release film without any humps, wrinkles or folds. The S-wrap puller consists of two anti-stick rollers. The upper roller rotates in anti-clockwise direction where as the bottom roller rotates in clockwise direction. This mechanism gives the pulling action for prepreg tape. The nip gap of the rollers is adjusted by nip adjusting screws (19) to give the required tension to the prepreg tape (20). Break system can also be provided to the rollers to achieve the required tension in the prepreg tape. Since the prepreg tape is tacky, it is wound along with release film (21) from roll (9) on to a spool (22) mounted on spool mounting stand (23). For non-tacky i.e. dry prepreg tapes, release film will not be used. S-wrap puller is also provided with chilling arrangement, either by internal circulation of chilling media inside the rollers or by chilling pads on the rollers,<br>
