				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the separation of lignin from black liquor waste of paper mills. More particularly it relates to an improved method for separation of lignin and colouring matter from black liquor effluent from paper mill waste.<br>
According to the widely accepted concept lignin may be defined as an amorphous polyphenolic material arising from an enzyme mediated dehydrogenative polymerization of three phenyIpropanoid monomers, of e.g. coniferyl, sinapyl and p—coumaryl alcohols. Lignin (from the latin lignum, wood) is after cellulose, the principal. constituent of woody structure of higher plants in part deposited in the xylem cell walls, in part located in the intercellular spaces.<br>
The sulfite waste liquors from paper mills contain upto 3 to 6*/. lignin which is not easily biodegradable. This lignin may act as a source of vanillin, syringic aldehyde, can be used as extender for phenolic plastics as well as to strengthen the rubber, as oil mud additive to stabilize asphalt, as emulsions to precipitate proteins.<br>
Lignin also can be converted to pure low molecular weight chemicals; it may serve as an important feedstock for the chemical industry. At present only vanillin and dimethyl sulfide are produced commercially, taut economically competitive processes for conversion to phenolic and aromatic chemicals are real possibilities.<br><br>
Until the past 2--3 decades or so, large amounts of lignin were discarded into streams and waterways as dilute aqueous solutions which is not tolerated now and almost all waste streams containing lignin are concentrated and burned.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines, a number of primary and secondary treatment systems to control effluents are installed, treatment comprises clarifiers to remove 85—100 wt. 'A of solids such as clarifiers in first treatment and lagoons aerated or otherwise, trickling filters, modified biological systems, charcoal treatment etc. to remove as 90—95*/. of BOD, most solids, most of the toxicity except very little colour. Ultra filtrations also has been tried and found futile to remove total dissolved  solid s comp1ete1y.<br>
The pulp and paper industry uses large amounts of water which is recycled and reused resulting in temperature rise and dissolution of more solids in water enhancing problems e.g. corrosion , slime and other deposits. Directly ar indirectly all of these viz. BOD color and toxicity may effect aquatic life.<br>
Total dissolved solids are removed and used as energy source in fuel. Biomethanation has also been attempted.Al1 these do not meet the standards of pollution control. Therefore it become* very essential to remove color, total dissolved solids with negligible quantity of BOD and COD.<br>
in the prior art following methods are used for the separation of lignin from black liquor in paper industry. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief hereinbelow :<br>
This is mainly useful to minimise industrial pollution due to the black liquor.<br>
PURIFICATION OF WASTE WATERS FROM INSTALLATIONS FOR BLEACHING SULFATE PAPER<br>

The lignin and other organic matter are mostly precipitated from waste water by addition of mineral acid and by filtration. The filtered waste water is treated with feebly alkaline ion exchange resin activated with acid and then resin is eluted with alkali to remove adsorbed lignin. The eluate together with solution of original precipitate in alkali are recycled to the sulfate pulp process, preferably by burning in the black liquor recovery process.<br>
DESULFURIZATION OF WASTE GAS WITH PULP WASTE LIQUOR<br>
Suyama A; Hayashi, H [Mitsubishi Kausha Ltd. Toyo Tokushi Kogyo K.K.3 Jap. Kokai 76, 20, 089 17 Feb. 1976. CA 85:67527a (1976) Fibre-free black liquor is used for waste gas desulfurization and lignin in waste liquor is precipitated as a lignin sulfate. The  fibre is removed by boiling.  Thus 1100 ppm SO   containing<br>
diesel. oil boiler flue gas was desulfurized with  bailed  black liquor  (pH  12) to desul. furize 93%..  The spent liquor  was  air<br>
oxidised  and  coagulant  was added to  precipitate  lignin  and others.<br>

Methylolated lignin til is manufactured from black Kraft liquor residues by initially oxidizing black kraft liquor containing [I]1 and salt in situ methylolat ion of [I] with an aldehyde followed by lowering the pH of the black kraft liquor residue to precipitate methylolated [i] and finally recovering the precipitated methylolated t. 11 from black liquor residue. Thus a black kraft  residue  tpH  131 was oxidized with air  until  the  Na B<br>
content was  1%. and then stirred with 31b/mole HCHO/1000 lb I at<br>
70  for  2h.   The black, liquor containing  methylolated  I  was<br>
acidified  with HSQ  to pH „  The methylolated I. was  coagulated<br>
4       4 a at  85 , filtered, washed with water.  The  methylolated  slurry<br>
was then treated with triethanolamine to pH 7 and then sulfonat-<br>

Wang, W, Faming, Z; Bhenging G. Bhouming S. CN 1,094,106 '2h Oct. 1994. Appl. 94, 104, 572 05 May 1994. CA 1.23:343940 n<br>
The agglutinant for recovering alkali and lignin from black liquor of a paper waste comprises a mixture of a waste Al, an acid mixture, a polymer selected from polys, (dimethy1aminometh-yl) acrylamide3 polyaci'y 1 amde derives, poly vinyl sulfonate, and Na aglinate a coal dust, a Mg based inorganics salt and lime.<br>
In hitherto known processes main drawbacks are the use of acidic media which involve problems of corrosion, filtration due to collidal particles and incomplete removal of organic as well as inorganic matter in the effluent water, colored effluent water due to organics mainly lignin.<br>
There is continuing interest on the development of new improved process for separation of lignin, organic matters, inorganic compound's from the black liquor produced in the paper  industry.<br>
It is known fact that lignin in effluents is not biodegradable and hence disposal problems in the environment.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the tratment of black liquor waste from paper mills more particularly the separation of lignin, organic and inorganic coloured matters from black liquor waste produced in the processing of paper mill to the environment standards for treated effluents.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which does not use acidic conditions for the treatment of effulents, thereby reducing the hazards of corrosion and other problems mentioned earlier.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the separation of lignin from black liquor waste of paper mills which comprises a process for the separation of lignin from black liquor waste of paper mills, characterized in that treating the black liquor under stirring with a mixture of calcium chloride, alum and common earth at a ratio ranges from 0.1-1% to 0.1-1% to 0.1-1% for a period of atleast 5 minutes, separating the lignin by known methods.In an embodiment of the present invention 0.1 to 1 wt */♦ of commercial calcium chloride, 0.1 to 1 wt% commercial alum and 0.1 to 1 wt 'A of common earth  with respect to effluent.<br>
The  separation of lignin may be effected by known methods  such<br>
f i 11 r a t ian,  dec an t a t i on.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the ion  exchange<br>
resin used may be selected from anion/cat ion exchange resin<br>
wh i ch are commerciaI1y available.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the treated effluent was found to be passing BOD, COD and all other parameters of effluent treated water required by  environmental agencies.<br>
In another feature of the present invention all operations in this process are done at room temperature without the use of mineral acid etc. to make all the effluents free from organics and inorganics, the treated water can be recycled to the process. The resins used in the process can be regenerated with known methods.<br>
The invention is described hereinbelow with reference to	follow<br>
ing examples which are illustrative only and should	not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention	in any<br>
manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
500 ml black pulp liquor industrial effluent containing 3X lignin was treated with calcium chloride (3 g) alum (3 g) and earth (3 g) under stirring for 0.5 h and filtered without suction to remove lignin. The filtrate was adjusted to pH ~8 by adding 10%. NaOH solution (0.6 ml) and treated with regenerated washed Indion resin to bring pH 2-3 with stirring (10 ml). This was repeated once again finally the solution was passed through activated charcoal column with light suction to give colorless water with no organic matter.<br>
Initial  COD was 1,20000 which was brought down to 230  mgs/lit. BOD was found 25.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
500 ml black pulp liquor industrial effluent containing 3% lignin was treated with calcium chloride (3 g) alum (1.5 g) and earth (1.5 g) under stirring for 0.5 h and filtered without suction to remove lignin. The pH of filtrate was adjusted to about 8 by adding 10'/. NaOH solution (0.5 ml) and treated with regenerated washed Indion resin with stirring to bring the pH of solution to ~2-3 (10 ml). This was then filtered and the filtrate was passed through Tulsan resin column (80 g) when the pH of the eluate changed to neutral. This was then passed through charcoal column to remove colour, when a clear water was obtained with no organic or inorganic matter.<br>
COD  which was 1,30000 initially reduced to 200 mg/lit  and  BOD also reduced to 20.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
500 ml black liquor industrial effluent was treated with calcium chloride (1 g) alum (1 g) and earth (1 g) with stirring for 15 min. A muck settled (~100 ml) after about 4 h, supernatant clean solution was decanted and the liqnin sludge was filtered through fluted filter paper. Decanted clear solution and the filtrate were combined and treated with Indian (10 ml regenerated and washed) resin with stirring and filtered through fluted filter paper. The filtrate was then passed through activated charcoal column (5 g) when clear water was obtained with no organic or inorganic: matter.<br>
Initial COD was 80,000 which was reduced to 180 ml/lit BOD  also was reduced to 27.<br><br><br><br><br>
