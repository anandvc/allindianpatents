THE PATENTS ACT. 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See section 10; Rule 13]<br>
FOLDABLE CARTON ABLE TO COLLAPSE FROM AN ERECTED CONDITION;<br>
MAXWELL JULIEN AN AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL OF 5 MARION STREET, MIDLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA.<br><br><br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to collapsible packaging such as cartons and the like which are generally formed from blanks formed from a substantially rigid sheet material whereby the blanks are folded to form the carton.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The cartons to which the invention relates are used in a wide variety of circumstances and one particular example of the application of the cartons relates to the forms of packaging used with take-away food items. It is a common characteristic of such cartons that they are not capable of accommodating liquid contents without the utilisation of a supplementary containment means. As a result, in the event of any spillage within the carton the liquid contents of the carton will leak and can create an undesirable circumstance for customers.<br>
In the past, attempts have been made to provide cartons which can to some degree overcome this problem. One example of such a carton is disclosed in US patent specification 4471904 which provides a carton whereby the floor is held in a raised position from the lower limit of the carton. However, in order for the carton to be foldable there is no closed junction between the floor panel and the end and side panels. As a result, there is still the likelihood of leakage therebetween. A further example comprises that which is disclosed in US patent specification 2430755. However, the carton disclosed in that specification is not one that which is capable of being folded and providing a closed junction between the floor and the side panels.<br>
It is desirable to provide a carton which when assembled from a blank can be folded to lie in a substantially flat condition and which can be readily unfolded into an erect condition whereby when in the erect condition no further action or<br><br><br>
containment means need be provided in order to prevent the leakage of the contents of the carton escaping from the base of the carton.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly the invention resides in a collapsible carton which is formed from a single blank which when formed from the blank is capable of being folded between a folded flat condition and an erect condition whereby when in the erect condition the carton has a floor, two opposed end panels and two opposed side panels to define a generally rectangular prismatic shaped space, the end panels and the side panels having substantially the same height, wherein the floor panel is formed of a single panel and the junction between the floor and each of the end panels and each of the side panels is defined by a closed fold line there between, the end panels each having a pair of first diagonal fold lines extending from the junction between the sides of the floor and the sides of the respective end panel and converging to terminate at a transverse central axis of the end panel, said first diagonal fold lines being substantially perpendicular to each other, said end panels have a height greater than the termination of the diagonals, whereih the floor is provided with a first central fold line which is substantially centrally located and which extends between the end panels and is adapted to permit the floor to fold inwardly into the space about the first central fold line while the first diagonal fold lines fold , said end panels being provided with a second central, fold line extending centrally from the floor to the opposed edge of the end panel, each end panel and each side panel is formed with an extension panel, said extension panels being of substantially the same height and being hingedly supported from the respective end or side panel, wherein in the erected carton the abutting edges of adjacent extension panels are defined by a closed fold line, the extension panel of each end panel being formed with a pair of second diagonal fold lines extending between the junction between the end panel and the extension panel at the sides thereof and converging to terminate at the junction of the second fold line with the outer edge of the extension panel, whereby on the erection of the carton the extension panels can each fold about the second diagonal fold lines<br><br><br>
and the junction with the end panel to cause the extension panels of the side panels to fold over the space to close the space.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention the termination of the diagonals defines the height of the side panel.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention the carton is formed from a blank where the end and side panels are each hingedly supported from the edge of the floor through a fold line.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the above feature in the blank the adjacent sides of adjacent end and side panels are interconnected by a web having an edge which is substantially at 45° to the adjacent edges of the adjacent end and side panels and which has a further diagonal fold line extending from the junction of the adjacent end and side panels which bisects the angle therebetween.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention in the blank the side panels are hingedly supported from the floor and the end panels are hingedly supported from the side panels.<br>
According to a further preferred feature of the previous feature in the blank one end panel is supported from one of the side panels and the other end panel is supported from the other side panel.<br>
According to an alternative preferred feature of the previous feature in the blank each side panel supports a portion of an end panel whereby the portions of the end panels co-operate to define the end panels when the blank is folded to an erect condition.<br>
According to each preferred feature of the invention wherein in the blank at least one of a pair of edges of the end and side panels which are to become interengaged when the carton is formed are provided with glue flaps.<br>
The invention will be more fully understood in the light of the following description of several specific embodiments.<br><br><br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Each of the embodiments are directed to cartons which are formed from a stiff sheet material such as cardboard where the sheet materia! is formed into a blank and which can be folded to form a carton whereby when the carton has been formed it can be readily folded into a substantially flat condition and can be subsequently erected from the folded flat condition to provide a carton defining a generally rectangular prismatic shaped space whereby the junctions between the floor panel and the side panels and end panels and the junctions between the end panels and the side panels are closed and are resistant to the leakage of the contents. In forming the carton from the blank the formed carton may initially take the form of the folded carton which can then be erected into the carton when it is required. Alternatively in forming the carton from the blank it may initially take the form of the erected carton to be then capable of being folded into a substantially flat condition for transportation and/or storage and subsequent unfolding into an erected carton when required. If desired the internal face of the carton may be lined with a suitable lining such as greaseproof paper or the like which will further resist the flow of liquid materials through the body of the carton.<br><br><br>
The first embodiment as shown at Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 comprises a carton which is formed of a blank shown at Figure 1 where the carton has a floor panel 11, two end panels 12 and 13 and two side panels 14 and 15. Each of the end panels 12 and 13 and each of the side panels 14 and 15 are provided with an outer extension panel 16, 17, 18 and 19 respectively which when the carton is erected combine to provide the closure for the carton. Each of the end panels 12 and 13 and the side panels 14 and 15 are formed integrally with the floor panel 11 and are connected to the floor panel 11 by a fold line whereby they can be folded to be substantially perpendicular to the floor panel 11 which will bring their adjacent side edges into abutment with each other.<br>
The side edges of the side panels 14 and 15 and their extension panels 18 and 19 are provided with glue flaps 20 which are adapted to be able to overlie the edge portions of the inner faces of the adjacent end panels 12 and 13 and their respective extension panels 16 and 17 when the side panels and end panels are folded along their fold line with the floor panel 11 as described above. The glue flaps 20 may be rendered self adherent such that they will adhere to the edge portions of end panels 12 or 13 or may have an adhesive applied thereto prior to folding to effect such adhesion. As a result of the fixing of the glue flaps 20 to the end panels 12 and 13 and their respective extension panels 16 and 17 the junctions between the end panels12 and 13 and the side panels 14 and 15 and between the respective extension panels are sealingly closed.<br>
Each of the end panels 12 and 13 are provided with a pair of first diagonal fold lines 21 and 22 which extend from the junction between the adjacent edges of the end panel and the adjacent side panel and terminate at the central axis of the end panel whereby the diagonal fold lines 21 and 22 are perpendicular to each other.<br>
In addition in the case of the first embodiment the floor panel 11 is provided with a first central fold line 23 which is centrally located and extends between the end panels 12 and 13. Each of the end panels 12 and 13 and the respective extension panels 16 and 17 are formed with a second central fold line 24 which is<br><br><br>
co-linear in the folded blank shown at Figure 1 with the first central fold line of the floor panel 11.<br>
In addition each of the extension panels 16 and 17 on the end panels 12 and 13 are provided with a pair of second diagonal fold lines 25 and 26 which are parallel to the first diagonal fold lines 21 and 22. The second diagonal fold lines 25 and 26 extend from the junction between the respective end pane! and the extension panel to converge and terminate at the outer edge of the extension panel<br>
In the formation of the carton from the blank, the side panels 14 and 15 and the end panels 12 and 13 are folded to be substantially perpendicular to the floor panel 11 which brings the glue flaps 20 into face to face engagement with the adjacent edge portions of the inner faces of respective end panels 12 and 13 and their extension panels 16 and 17. Figure 2 illustrates the carton partially erected where one end panel 12 and its extension panel 16 has been folded with the adjacent side panel 14 and its extension panel 18 to be perpendicular to the floor panel 11. The glue flaps 20 on the side panels 14 and 15 and their extension panels 18 and 19 are then bonded to the respective end panels 12 and 13 and their extension panels 16 and 17 to define a substantially cubic carton as shown at Figure 3 where the extension panels 16, 17, 18 and 19 are open. . Once erected the side panels, end panels and floor panel of the formed carton define a liquid tight space whereby the folded junctions between the floor panel and each of the side panels and end panel is substantially continuous and is closed and the junctions between the side panels and the end panels are also continuous and sealed.<br>
Furthermore, the carton can be readily folded to a substantially flat condition as shown at Figure 6. This is effected by causing the first central fold line 23 of the floor panel 11 to fold such that the first central fold line 23 moves inwardly. In addition the first diagonal fold lines 21 and 22 of each of the end panels to move inwardly to lie between the side panels 14 and 15 to overlie the portions of the floor panel 11 to each side of the first central fold line 23 and the portion of the<br><br><br>
second central fold line 24 between the junction of the first diagonal fold lines 21 and the junction between the respective end panel 12 and 13 and the floor panel 11 moves to overlie the first central fold line 23. In addition the portion of the second central fold line 24 between the junction of the first diagonal fold line 21 and the outer edge of the extension panel 16 and 17 folds such that it moves inwardly to lie between the side panels 14 and 15. This action brings the side panels together with the folded floor panel 11 and folded end panels 16 and 17 located there between as shown at Figure 6.<br>
When the carton is in the erected condition as shown at Figure 3 the carton can be closed by causing the second diagonal fold lines to fold such that the inner faces of the extensions 17 and 16 end panels to each side of the second diagonal fold lines 25 and 26 fold inwardly about the second diagonal fold lines towards each other as shown at Figure 4. As a result the extensionsl 7 and 16 of the end panels fold outward from each end of the carton which serves to bring the extensions 18 and 19 on the side panels 14 and 15 towards each other to overlie the space created by the carton between the floor panel, the side panels and the end panels. The folded extensions of the end panels can then be folded downwardly about the fold line defined between the junction of each end panel 12 and 13 and its respective extension 16 and 17 whereby the folded extension lies closely adjacent and substantially parallel to the outer face of the respective end panel as shown at Figure 5.<br>
In the case of the second embodiment as shown at Figures 7 to 11 the carton is of a generally similar form to that of the first embodiment with the exception that in the case of the side panels 214 and 215 the edges are not provided with glue flaps but rather the edges of the end panels 212 and 213 are interconnected with the adjacent edges of the adjacent side panels 214 and 215 by a web element 227 which has an outer edge which is disposed at substantially 45° to the edges of the respective end panel and side panel. In addition.the webs 227 are each provided with a third diagonal fold line 228 which extends from the junction between the adjacent edge"s of"the adjacent end panel and side panel where the<br><br><br>
third diagonal fold line 228 bisects the angle between the adjacent end panel and side panel.<br>
In addition the side edges of the extensions 216 and 217 of the end panels 212 and 213 are provided with glue flaps 220 which are adapted to be able to overlie the edge portions of the inner faces of the adjacent extension panels 218 and 219 of the side panels 214 and 215 when the side panels and end panels are folded along their fold line with the floor panel 211. The glue flaps 220 may be rendered self adherent such that they will adhere to the edge portions of extension panels 218 and 219 of the side panels 214 and 215 or may have an adhesive applied thereto prior to folding to effect such adhesion. As a result of the fixing of the glue flaps 220 to the extension panels 218 and 219 the junctions between the extension panels on the side panels 214 and 215 and the end panels 212 and 213 are sealingly closed.<br>
In folding the blank to form the erected carton as shown in Figure 8 each web 227 is folded about the junction between the respective end panel and side panel and the third diagonal fold line 228 is caused to fold and move inwardly such that the web is folded and lies within the carton adjacent the respective side wall, to be bonded thereto.<br>
The erected carton can then be folded into flat condition as shown at Figure 11 in the same manner as has been described in relation to the first embodiment. In addition the erected carton can be closed in the same manner as has been described in relation to the first embodiment and as shown at Figures 9 and 10.<br>
The third embodiment as shown at Figures 12 to 16 is of generally similar form to the first and second embodiment in terms of the configuration of the erected carton as shown at Figure 13. The difference in relation to the third embodiment relates to the configuration of the blank as shown at Figure 13 in that the end panels 412 and 413 are interconnected with one or the other side panel 418 or 419 respectively.  When the carton has been formed from the blank as shown at<br><br><br>
Figure 13 it can be folded and collapsed in a similar manner to that of the first and second embodiment as shown at Figure 16 and can be closed in a similar manner to that of the first and second embodiment as shown at Figures 14 and 15.<br>
The fourth embodiment of Figures 17 to 21 comprises a carton which is of generally similar form to the first and second embodiment in terms of the configuration of the erected carton as shown at Figure 18. The carton is formed from a blank where each of the side panels 614 and 615 and their extensions supports a portion of each end panel and their extensions which when the carton is erected combine to form the end panels. When the carton has been formed from the blank as shown at Figure 18 it can be folded and collapsed in a similar manner to that of the first, second and third embodiment as shown at Figure 21 and can be closed in a similar manner to that of the first and second embodiment as shown at Figures 19 and 20.<br>
The fifth embodiment of Figures 22 to 26 is of a similar form to that of the third embodiment of Figures 17 to 21 with the exception that the adjacent edges of the portions of the end panels 712a, 712b, 713a and 713b and the floor panel 711 are interconnected by web members 727 having an edge which is at 45 degrees to the respective edges of the portion of the respective end panel and the floor panel. Each web 727 is provided with a third diagonal fold line 728 extending from the junction between the respective portion of the end panel and the floor panel and which bisects the angle therebetween. In formation of the carton the web panels 727 are folded inwardly as a result of the third diagonal fold line folding inwardly into the interior of the carton whereby on the carton being erected the folded web 727 lies against the end panel and is glued thereto. When the carton has been formed from the blank as shown at Figure 23 it can be folded and collapsed in a similar manner to that of the first, second, third and fourth embodiment as shown at Figure 26 and can be closed in a similar manner to that of the first and second embodiment as shown at Figures 24 and 25.<br><br><br>
The sixth embodiment of Figures 27 and 28a to 28g is of very similar form to the first embodiment as shown at Figures 1 to 6 and the same reference numerals have been used in respect of corresponding features. The only difference is that the sixth embodiment includes a transverse fold line 30 formed in each of the end panels 12 and 13 and which extends from the point of intersection of the first diagonal fold lines 21 and 22 to one side of each end panel 12 and 13. The transverse fold line facilitates the folding of the blank to form a carton. The steps involved in forming the carton are illustrated at Figures 28a to 28g.<br>
The first step involves folding the glue flaps 20 provided on the side panel 15 and extension panel 19 which are remote from the transverse fold line 30 inwardly such that they overlie the respective panel 15 and 19 respectively as shown at Figure 28a. The second step involves folding each end panel 12 and 13 about the first diagonal folds line 21 and 22 and simultaneously folding the end panel 12 and 13 about the transverse fold line 30 to cause the outer portion of each end panel to underlie the portion of the end panel defined by the first diagonals 21 and 22 as shown at Figure 28b. The third step involves folding the glue flaps 20 provided on the side panel 14 and extension panel 18 which are proximate the transverse fold line 30, inwardly such that they overlie the respective panel 14 and 18 respectively as shown at Figure 28c. The fourth step involves folding each end panel 12 and 13 about the junction with the floor panel 11 such that the end panels 12 and 13 in their entirety overlie the floor panel 11 as shown at Figure 28d. The fifth step involves folding the side panel 15 which is remote from the transverse fold line 30 about the junction with the floor panel 11 after the exposed faces of the glue flaps 20 of that side panel and it"s extension panel 19 have been rendered such that they will adhere to the opposed faces of the end panels 12 and 13 as shown at Figure 28e. The sixth step involves folding the blank as folded to that point in time about the central fold line 23 in the floor panel 11 as shown at figure 28f. The final step involves folding the side panel 14 which is proximate the transverse fold line 30 about the junction with the floor panel 11 after the exposed faces of the glue flaps 20 of that side panel and it"s extension panel 18 have been rendered such that they will adhere to the opposed faces of<br><br><br>
the end panels 12 and 13 as shown at Figure 28g. The resultant folded blank will take the form as shown at Figure 6 in relation to the first embodiment and can be opened to form an erected carton as shown at Figure 3 in relation to the first embodiment and can be folded in the same manner as is described in regard to the first embodiment and as shown at Figures 4 and 5.<br>
The above folding sequence in relation to the sixth embodiment is given by way of example only. The folding sequence can vary depending upon the nature of the folding facilities that are available<br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>
It should be appreciated that the scope of the present invention need not be limited   to   the   particular   scope   of   the   embodiments   described   above.<br><br><br>

when formed from the blank is capable of being folded between a folded flat condition and an erect condition whereby when in the erect condition the carton has a floor, two opposed end panels and two opposed side panels to define a generally rectangular prismatic shaped space, the end panels and the side panels having substantially the same height, wherein the floor panel is formed of a single panel and the junction between the floor and each of the end panels and each of the side panels is defined by a closed fold line therebetween, the end panels each having a pair of first diagonal fold lines extending from the junction between the sides of the floor and the sides of the respective end panel and converging to terminate at a transverse central axis of the end panel, said first diagonal fold lines being substantially perpendicular to each other, said end panels have a height being equal to or greater than the termination of the diagonals, wherein the floor is provided with a first central fold line which is substantially centrally located and which extends between the end panels and is adapted to permit the floor to fold inwardly into the space about the first central fold line while the first diagonal fold lines fold , said end panels being provided with a second central fold line extending centrally from the floor to the opposed edge of the end panel, each end panel and each side panel is formed with an extension panel, said extension panels being of substantially the same height and being hingedly supported from the respective end or side panel, wherein in the erected carton the abutting edges of adjacent extension panels are defined by a closed fold line, the extension panel of each end panel being formed with a pair of second diagonal fold lines extending between the junction between the end panel and the extension panel at the sides thereof and converging to terminate at the junction of the second fold line with the outer edge of the extension panel, whereby on the erection of the carton the, extension panels can each fold about the second<br><br>
diagonal fold lines and the junction with the end panel to cause the extension panels of the side panels to fold over the space to close the space.<br>
2.	A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 1 wherein the termination<br>
of the diagonals defines the height of the side panels.<br>
l3..  ■    .	A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 1 wherein the carton is<br>
formed from a blank in which the side panels are each hingedly supported from the edge of the floor through a fold line.<br>
«4.	A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 1 or 5 wherein in the blank<br>
the adjacent sides of adjacent end and side panels are interconnected by a web having an edge which is substantially at 45° to the adjacent edges of the adjacent end and side panels and which has a further diagonal fold line extending from the junction of the adjacent end and side panels which bisects the angle therebetween.<br>
5« • _ A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 1 or 5 wherein in the blank the second side panels are hingedly supported from the floor and the end panels are hingedly supported from the side panels.<br>
6.	A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 7 wherein in the blank one end panel is supported from one of the side panels and the other end panel is supported from the other side panel.<br>
7.	A collapsible carton as claimed at claim 7 wherein in the blank each side panel supports a portion of an end panel whereby the portions of the end panels co-operate to define the first panels when the blank is folded to an erect condition.<br><br><br>
8. ""■ v ." A collapsible carton as claimed at any one of the preceding claims wherein in the blank at least one of a pair of edges of adjacent side and end panels which are to become interengaged when the carton is formed are provided with glue flaps.<br>
