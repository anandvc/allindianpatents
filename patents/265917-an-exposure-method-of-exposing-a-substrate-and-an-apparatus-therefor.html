POSITION MEASUREMENT METHOD, POSITION CONTROL METHOD,<br>
MEASUREMENT METHOD, LOADING METHOD, EXPOSURE METHOD<br>
AND EXPOSURE APPARATUS, AND DEVICE MANUFACTURING<br>
METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to position measurement<br>
methods, position control methods, measurement methods,<br>
loading methods, exposure methods and exposure apparatus, and<br>
device manufacturing methods, and more particularly to a<br>
position measurement method in which position information of<br>
a plate mounted freely detachable on a moving body is measured,<br>
a position control method that uses the position measurement<br>
method, a measurement method in which information related to<br>
a plate where an opening is formed in order to mount an object<br>
is measured, a loading method that uses the measurement method,<br>
an exposure method that utilizes the loading method and an<br>
exposure apparatus suitable for performing each of the methods<br>
described above, and a device manufacturing method that uses<br>
the exposure apparatus or the exposure method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, in a lithography process for<br>
manufacturing electronic devices such as a semiconductor<br>
device (an integrated circuit or the like), a liquid crystal<br>
display device, or the like, a reduction projection exposure<br>
apparatus (the so-called stepper) by the step-and-repeat<br>
2<br><br>
method that transfers a pattern formed on a mask or a reticle<br>
(hereinafter generally referred to as a 'reticle') onto a<br>
photosensitive object such as a wafer or a glass plate<br>
(hereinafter generally referred to as a 'wafer') on which a<br>
resist (a photosensitive agent) is coated, or a projection<br>
exposure apparatus (the so-called scanning stepper) by the<br>
step-and-scan method is mainly used.<br>
Due to higher integration and finer circuit patterns of<br>
the semiconductor devices, in order to improve the resolution<br>
of the projection optical system equipped in the projection<br>
exposure apparatus, the wavelength of the exposure light<br>
(exposure wavelength) is becoming shorter while the numerical<br>
aperture (NA) of the projection optical system is gradually<br>
increasing. Meanwhile, depth of focus is becoming smaller,<br>
due to such shorter exposure wavelength and increasing<br>
numerical aperture (larger NA). The exposure wavelength is<br>
presumed to be shorter in the future, and if such a situation<br>
continues, the depth of focus may become so small that margin<br>
shortage may occur during the exposure operation.<br>
Therefore, as a method of substantially shortening the<br>
exposure wavelength while increasing (widening) the depth of<br>
focus when compared with the depth of focus in the air, the<br>
exposure apparatus that utilizes the immersion exposure<br>
method is beginning to gather attention. As the exposure<br>
apparatus that utilizes the liquid immersion method, an<br>
exposure apparatus that performs exposure in a state where<br>
the space between the lower surface of the projection optical<br>
system and the wafer surface is locally filled with liquid<br>
such as water or an organic solvent is known (refer to, for<br>
3<br><br>
example, Patent Document 1).  In the exposure apparatus<br>
according to Patent Document 1, the resolution is improved<br>
utilizing the fact that the wavelength of the exposure light<br>
in the liquid becomes 1/n of the wavelength in the air (n is<br>
the refractive index of the liquid which is normally around<br>
1.2 to 1.6), and also the depth of focus is substantially-<br>
increased n times when compared with the case where the same<br>
resolution is obtained by a projection optical system<br>
(supposing that such a projection optical system can be made)<br>
that does not employ the liquid immersion method. That is,<br>
the depth of focus can be substantially increased n times than<br>
in the air.<br>
Recently, in wafer stages of the exposure apparatus, a<br>
proposal has been made of disposing a freely detachable plate<br>
that forms a flat section substantially flush with the wafer<br>
in the periphery of the wafer held by the wafer stage. In the<br>
case of using such a detachable plate in the wafer stage, the<br>
position of the plate has to be precisely known.<br>
In addition, in the case of using such plate in the wafer<br>
stage, an opening (such as an opening with a circular shape<br>
in the case of a semiconductor wafer) for positioning the wafer<br>
has to be formed in the center of the plate. However, for<br>
example, in the case the degree of roundness of the circular<br>
opening of the plate is low and the circular shape is deformed<br>
or in an ellipse, the gap between the circumferential surface<br>
of the wafer and the inner circumference surface of the opening<br>
becomes uneven, and inconveniences could occur, such as the<br>
wafer coming into contact with the inner wall surface of the<br>
opening of the plate, or not being able to insert the wafer<br>
4<br><br>
into the opening of the plate.<br>
In addition, because the gap between the inner wall<br>
surface of the opening of the plate and the wafer is extremely<br>
small, smooth loading operation of the wafer will be difficult<br>
if the relative position of the wafer and the plate is not<br>
accurately aligned when loading the wafer.<br>
In addition, in the case of the exposure apparatus that<br>
utilizes the liquid immersion method, there was the risk of<br>
the liquid flowing into parts where the gap between the inner<br>
circumference edge of the opening of the plate and the outer<br>
circumferential edge of the wafer is large.<br>

Publication No. WO99/49504.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a first position measurement method in which<br>
position information of a plate of a predetermined shape<br>
detachably mounted on a moving body is measured, the position<br>
measurement method comprising: an outer periphery edge<br>
position obtaining process where a part of the plate is<br>
detected while a position of the moving body is measured by<br>
a measurement unit that sets a movement coordinate system of<br>
the movement body, and position information of an outer<br>
periphery edge of the plate is also obtained, based on<br>
detection results of the plate and measurement results of the<br>
measurement unit corresponding to the detection results.<br>
According to this method, a part of the plate is detected<br>
5<br><br>
while the position of the moving body on which the plate with<br>
a predetermined shape is detachably mounted is measured by<br>
the measurement unit that sets the movement coordinate system<br>
of the movement body, and based on the detection results and<br>
the measurement results of the measurement unit corresponding<br>
to the detection results, the position information of the outer<br>
periphery edge of the plate is obtained. Therefore, the<br>
position of the outer periphery edge of the plate can be<br>
controlled on the movement coordinate system set by the<br>
measurement unit.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a position control method in which the<br>
position of a moving body where a plate is detachably mounted<br>
is controlled, wherein the position of the moving body is<br>
controlled, based on position information of the outer<br>
periphery edge of the plate measured using the position<br>
measurement method according to the present invention.<br>
According to this method, because the position of the<br>
moving body is controlled based on the position information<br>
of the outer periphery edge of the plate measured using the<br>
position measurement method according to the present<br>
invention, the position of the object can be controlled taking<br>
into consideration the position of the outer periphery edge<br>
of the plate.<br>
The position control method of the present invention can<br>
be used, for example, to control the position of a moving body<br>
on which an object subject to exposure is placed in an exposure<br>
apparatus. Accordingly, it can also be said from a third<br>
aspect that the present invention is a first exposure apparatus<br>
6<br><br>
that uses the position control method of the present invention.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a measurement method in which information<br>
on a plate where an opening is formed to place an object, the<br>
plate being detachably mounted on a moving body, is measured,<br>
the measurement method comprising: an inner periphery edge<br>
position obtaining process where a part of the plate is<br>
detected and position information of an inner periphery edge<br>
of the opening is obtained, based on detection results of the<br>
plate.<br>
According to this method, a part of the plate where the<br>
opening is formed to place the object is detected, the plate<br>
being detachably mounted on the moving body, and based on the<br>
detection results the position information of the inner<br>
periphery edge of the opening is obtained. Therefore, based<br>
on the position information on the inner periphery edge, it<br>
becomes possible to calculate the position and the shape of<br>
the opening.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a first loading method in which an object<br>
is loaded on a moving body where a plate that has an opening<br>
to place an object is detachably mounted, wherein the object<br>
is loaded into the opening of the plate on the moving body,<br>
based on position information of the inner periphery edge of<br>
the opening of the plate obtained using the measurement method<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
According to this method, the object is loaded into the<br>
opening of the plate on the moving body, based on the position<br>
information of the inner periphery edge of the opening of the<br>
7<br><br>
plate obtained using the measurement method of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, it becomes easy to load the object<br>
to the opening of the plate on the moving body.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a first exposure method in which an object<br>
is exposed, the exposure method comprising: a loading process<br>
in which the object is loaded into an opening in the plate<br>
on a moving body using the loading method according to the<br>
present invention; and an irradiation process in which an<br>
exposure beam is irradiated on the object loaded on the moving<br>
body.<br>
According to this method, the object is loaded into the<br>
opening of the plate on the moving body using the first loading<br>
method of the present invention, and exposure is performed<br>
irradiating the exposure beam on the object loaded on the<br>
moving body.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a second loading method in which an object<br>
subject to processing is loaded into a depressed section on<br>
an upper end section of a moving body, the loading method<br>
comprising: a placing process in which an object is placed<br>
in the depressed section on the moving body; and an obtaining<br>
process in which information on a position relation between<br>
an inner periphery edge of the depressed section and the object<br>
placed within the depressed section is obtained.<br>
In this case, 'object' is a concept that includes the<br>
object subject to processing. More specifically, in the<br>
placing process, an object subject to processing may be placed<br>
within the depressed section on the moving body, or other<br>
8<br><br>
objects, such as an object used only for the purpose of<br>
obtaining the position relation described above may be placed.<br>
In any case, in the obtaining process, the information<br>
on the position relation between the inner periphery edge of<br>
the depressed section and the object placed within the<br>
depressed section is obtained. Accordingly, based on the<br>
position relation that has been obtained, it becomes possible<br>
to load the object in the depressed section of the moving body<br>
at a predetermined positional relation.<br>
According to an eighth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a second exposure method in which an object<br>
subject to processing is exposed, the exposure method<br>
comprising: a placing process in which the object subject to<br>
processing is placed within a depressed section of a moving<br>
body using the second loading method according to the present<br>
invention; and an irradiation process in which an exposure<br>
beam is irradiated on the object subject to processing placed<br>
within the depressed section of the moving body.<br>
According to this method, the object subject to<br>
processing is placed into the depressed section on the moving<br>
body using the second loading method of the present invention,<br>
and exposure is performed irradiating the exposure beam on<br>
the object subject to exposure placed in the depressed section<br>
of the moving body.<br>
According to a ninth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a second exposure apparatus that irradiates<br>
an exposure beam on an object, the exposure apparatus<br>
comprising: a first stage on which a plate of a predetermined<br>
shape is detachably mounted a position measurement system that<br>
9<br><br>
measures a position of the first stage; a detection unit that<br>
can detect a part of the first stage; and an outer periphery<br>
edge position obtaining unit that detects a part of the plate<br>
using the detection unit while measuring a position of the<br>
first stage using the position measurement system, and based<br>
on detection results of the plate and measurement results of<br>
the position measurement system corresponding to the<br>
detection results, obtains position information of an outer<br>
periphery edge of the plate.<br>
According to this apparatus, the outer periphery edge<br>
position obtaining unit detects a part of the plate using the<br>
detection unit, while measuring the position of the first stage<br>
on which the plate having a predetermined shape is detachably<br>
mounted using the position measurement system, and also<br>
obtains the position information of the outer periphery edge<br>
of the plate based on the detection results and the measurement<br>
results of the position measurement system corresponding to<br>
the detection results. Therefore, it becomes possible to<br>
control the position of the outer periphery edge of the plate<br>
mounted on the first stage on a movement coordinate system<br>
set by the position measurement system.<br>
According to a tenth aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a third exposure apparatus that irradiates<br>

predetermined shape having an opening formed where the object<br>
is placed is mounted; a position measurement system that<br>
measures a position of the exposure stage; a detection unit<br>
that can detect a part of the exposure stage; and an inner<br>
10<br><br>
periphery edge position obtaining unit that detects a part<br>
of the plate using the detection unit while measuring a<br>
position of the exposure stage using the position measurement<br>
system, and based on detection results of the plate and<br>
measurement results of the position measurement system<br>
corresponding to the detection results, obtains position<br>
information of an inner periphery edge of the opening.<br>
According to this apparatus, the inner periphery edge<br>
position obtaining unit detects a part of the plate using the<br>
detection unit, while measuring the position of the exposure<br>
stage using the position measurement system, and also obtains<br>
the position information of the inner periphery edge of the<br>
opening based on the detection results and the measurement<br>
results of the position measurement system corresponding to<br>
the detection results. Therefore, it becomes possible to<br>
obtain the information of the position and shape of the opening,<br>
based on the position information of the inner periphery edge.<br>
In the lithography process, by using the first to third<br>
exposure apparatus of the present invention, a pattern can<br>
be formed on an object with good precision, which allows<br>
microdevices to be manufactured with good yield. Similarly,<br>
in the lithography process, by using the first and second<br>
exposure methods of the present invention, a pattern can be<br>
formed on an object with good precision, which allows<br>
microdevices to be manufactured with good yield. Accordingly,<br>
further from another aspect, the present invention can also<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
below, referring to Figs. 1 to 17B.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic configuration of an exposure<br>
apparatus 100 in an embodiment that is suitable for performing<br>
a position measurement method, a position control method, a<br>
measurement method, a loading method, and an exposure method<br>
14<br><br>
related to the present invention. Exposure apparatus 100 is<br>
a projection exposure apparatus by the step-and-scan method,<br>
that is, the so-called scanning stepper (also called a scanner) .<br>
Exposure apparatus 100 is equipped with an illumination system<br>
10, a reticle stage RST that holds reticle R, a projection<br>
unit PU, a stage unit 150 that has a wafer stage WST and a<br>
measurement stage MST, a control system for these parts, and<br>
the like.  On wafer stage WST, a wafer W is to be mounted.<br>
As is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No.2001-313250<br>
and its corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication<br>
No.2003/0025890 description or the like, illumination system<br>
10 includes an illuminance uniformity optical system, which<br>
includes parts such as a light source and an optical integrator<br>
(a fly-eye lens, an internal reflection type integrator, a<br>
diffractive optical element, and the like).  Illumination<br>
system 10 also includes a beam splitter, a relay lens, a<br>
variable ND filter, a reticle blind, and the like (all of which<br>
are not shown). As long as the national laws in designated<br>
states or elected states, to which this international<br>
application is applied, permit, the above disclosures of the<br>
publication and the U.S. Patent application publication<br>
description are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In illumination system 10, a slit-shaped illumination<br>
area set by the reticle blind on reticle R is illuminated with<br>
a substantially uniform illuminance by an illumination light<br>
(exposure light) IL. In this case, for example, an ArF excimer<br>
laser beam (wavelength: 193 nm) is used as illumination light<br>
IL.<br>
15<br><br>
On reticle stage RST, reticle R on which a circuit<br>
pattern or the like is formed on its pattern surface (the lower<br>
surface in Fig. 1) is fixed, for example, by vacuum suction<br>
or the like. Reticle stage RST is driven by a reticle stage<br>
drive system 11 (not shown in Fig. 1, refer to Fig. 6), which<br>
includes parts such as linear motors, and the stage can be<br>
finely driven within an XY plane perpendicular to the optical<br>
axis of illumination system 10 (coincides with an optical axis<br>
AX of a projection optical system PL that will be described<br>
later) . Reticle stage RST is also drivable at a designated<br>
scanning speed in a predetermined scanning direction (in this<br>
case, a Y-axis direction, which is the lateral direction of<br>
the page surface in Fig. 1) .<br>
The position (including rotation around a Z-axis) of<br>
reticle stage RST within a stage movement plane is constantly<br>
detected at a resolution of, e.g., around 0.5 to 1 nm, by a<br>
reticle laser interferometer (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
'reticle interferometer') 116, via a movable mirror 15 (in<br>
actual, a Y movable mirror that has a reflection surface<br>
orthogonal to the Y-axis direction and an X movable mirror<br>
that has a reflection surface orthogonal to an X-axis direction<br>
are arranged). The measurement values of reticle<br>
interferometer 116 are sent to a main controller 20 (not shown<br>
in Fig. 1, refer to Fig. 6) , and based on the measurement values,<br>
main controller 20 calculates the position of reticle stage<br>
RST in the X-axis direction, the Y-axis direction, and a 9z<br>
direction (rotation direction around the Z-axis), as well as<br>
control the position (and speed) of reticle stage RST by<br>
controlling reticle stage drive system 11, based on the<br>
16<br><br>
calculation results. Instead of movable mirror 15, the end<br>
surface of reticle stage RST may be mirror polished so as to<br>
form a reflection surface (corresponding to the reflection<br>
surface of movable mirror 15).<br>
Above reticle R, a pair of reticle alignment detection<br>
systems RAa and RAb, each constituted by a TTR (Through the<br>
Reticle) alignment optical system, is arranged in the X-axis<br>
direction at a predetermined distance. With this system, the<br>
light of the exposure wavelength is used to observe a pair<br>
of reticle alignment marks on reticle R and a pair of fiducial<br>
marks on measurement stage MST corresponding to the reticle<br>
alignment marks (hereinafter referred to as 'a first fiducial<br>
mark') at the same time, via projection optical system PL.<br>
As reticle alignment detection systems RAa and RAb, systems<br>
having a structure similar to the ones disclosed in, for<br>
example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication) No. 7-17 64 68 and the corresponding U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,646,413, are used. As long as the national laws in<br>
designated states (or elected states), to which this<br>
international application is applied, permit, the above<br>
disclosures of the publication and the U.S. Patent are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Projection unit PU is arranged below reticle stage RST<br>
in Fig. 1. Projection unit PU includes a barrel 40 and<br>
projection optical system PL, which consists of a plurality<br>
of optical elements held in a predetermined positional<br>
relation within barrel 40. As projection optical system PL,<br>
a dioptric system is used, consisting of a plurality of lenses<br>
(lens elements) that share an optical axis AX in the Z-axis<br>
17<br><br>
direction. Projection optical system PL is, for example,<br>
both-side telecentric, and has a predetermined projection<br>
magnification (such as one-quarter or one-fifth times).<br>
Therefore, when illumination light IL from illumination<br>
system 10 illuminates the illumination area on reticle R,<br>
illumination light IL that has passed through reticle R forms<br>
a reduced image of the circuit pattern within the illumination<br>
area on reticle R (a partial reduced image of the circuit<br>
pattern) on wafer W whose surface is coated with a resist<br>
(photosensitive agent), on an area (exposure area) conjugate<br>
with the illumination area, via projection unit PU (projection<br>
optical system PL).<br>
In exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment, because<br>
exposure is performed by applying the liquid immersion method,<br>
the opening on the reticle side becomes larger with the<br>
substantial increase of the numerical aperture NA. Therefore,<br>
in a dioptric system consisting only of lenses, it becomes<br>
difficult to satisfy the Petzval condition, which tends to<br>
lead to an increase in the size of the projection optical system.<br>
In order to prevent such an increase in the size of the<br>
projection optical system, a catodioptric system that<br>
includes mirrors and lenses may also be used.<br>
In addition, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
because exposure is performed by applying the liquid immersion<br>
method, in the vicinity of a lens 91 (hereinafter also referred<br>
to as a 'tip lens') that constitutes a part of projection<br>
optical system PL located closest to the image plane (close<br>
to wafer W) , a liquid supply nozzle 51A and a liquid recovery<br>
nozzle 51B that constitute a part of a liquid immersion<br>
18<br><br>
mechanism 132 is arranged.<br>
To liquid supply nozzle 51A, a supply pipe (not shown)<br>
that has one end connecting to a liquid supply unit 88 (not<br>
shown in Fig. 1, refer to Fig. 6) is connected, whereas to<br>
liquid recovery nozzle 51B, a recovery pipe (not shown) that<br>
has one end connecting to a liquid recovery unit 92 (not shown<br>
in Fig. 1, refer to Fig. 6) is connected.<br>
Liquid supply unit 88 includes a tank for the liquid,<br>
a compression pump, a temperature control unit, valves for<br>
controlling the supply/suspension of the liquid to the supply<br>
pipes, and the like. As the valves, for example, it is<br>
desirable to use flow control valves so that not only the<br>
supply/suspension of the liquid but also the flow rate of the<br>
liquid can be adjusted. The temperature control unit adjusts<br>
the temperature of the liquid in the liquid tank so that the<br>
temperature of the liquid is substantially around the same<br>
level as the temperature within the chamber (not shown) where<br>
the exposure apparatus main body is housed.<br>
Exposure apparatus 100 does not have to be fully equipped<br>
with the tank for the liquid, the compression pump, the<br>
temperature control unit, the valves, and the like, and at<br>
least a part of such components can be substituted by the<br>
equipment in the factory where exposure apparatus 100 is<br>
installed.<br>
Liquid recovery unit 92 includes a tank for the liquid<br>
and a suction pump, and valves for controlling the<br>
recovery/suspension of the liquid via the recovery pipes, and<br>
the like. As the valves, it is desirable to use flow control<br>
valves, corresponding to the valves on the liquid supply unit<br>
19<br><br>
88 side.<br>
Exposure apparatus 100 does not have to be fully equipped<br>
with the tank for the liquid, the suction pump, the valves,<br>
and the like, and at least a part of such components can be<br>
substituted by the equipment in the factory where exposure<br>
apparatus 100 is installed.<br>
As the liquid above, in this case, pure water<br>
(hereinafter, simply referred to as 'water' except for cases<br>
when further reference is necessary) that transmits the ArF<br>
excimer laser beam (light having the wavelength of 193 nm)<br>
will be used.  Pure water can be obtained easily by large<br>
quantity in a semiconductor manufacturing site or the like,<br>
and is also good for the photoresist on the wafer and the<br>
optical lenses because there are no adverse effects.<br>
Refractive index n of the water to the ArF excimer laser<br>
beam is approximately 1.44. In such water, the wavelength of<br>
illumination light IL is shortened to 193 nm x 1/n = around<br>
134 nm.<br>
Liquid supply unit 88 and liquid recovery unit 92 are<br>
each equipped with a controller, and the controllers operate<br>
under the control of main controller 20 (refer to Fig. 6) .<br>
In response to the instructions from main controller 20, the<br>
controller of liquid supply unit 88 opens the valve connecting<br>
to the supply pipe to a predetermined degree, and then supplies<br>
the water between tip lens 91 and wafer W (or a plate that<br>
will be described later) via liquid supply nozzle 51A. In<br>
addition, at this point, the controller of liquid supply unit<br>
92 opens the valve connecting to the recovery pipe to a<br>
predetermined degree in response to the instructions from main<br>
20<br><br>
controller 20, and then recovers the water from between tip<br>
lens 91 and wafer W into liquid recovery unit 92 (the liquid<br>
tank) via liquid recovery nozzle 51B. At this point, main<br>
controller 20 gives instructions to the controller of liquid<br>
supply unit 88 and the controller of liquid recovery unit 92<br>
so that the amount of water supplied between tip lens 91 and<br>
wafer W from liquid supply nozzle 51A and the amount of water<br>
recovered via liquid recovery nozzle 51B is constantly equal.<br>
Accordingly, a constant amount of water Lq (refer to Fig. 1)<br>
is held between tip lens 91 and wafer W. In this case, water<br>
Lq held between tip lens 91 and wafer W is constantly<br>
circulated.<br>
As is obvious from the description so far, liquid<br>
immersion mechanism 132 is a local liquid immersion mechanism<br>
that includes liquid supply unit 88, liquid recovery unit 92,<br>
supply pipes, recovery pipes, liquid supply nozzle 51A, liquid<br>
recovery nozzle 51B, and the like, and in the case of exposing<br>
wafer W, a liquid immersion area is formed on a part of wafer<br>
W.<br>
Even in the case measurement stage MST is located below<br>
projection unit PU, it is possible to fill in the water between<br>
measurement table MTB (to be described later) and tip lens<br>
91 as in the description above.<br>
In the description above, only one liquid supply nozzle<br>
and one liquid recovery nozzle were arranged for the sake of<br>
simplicity. However, the arrangement is not limited to this,<br>
and for example, an arrangement that has a plurality of nozzles<br>
may be employed, as is disclosed in the pamphlet of<br>
International Publication No. WO99/49504. The point is, any<br>
21<br><br>
arrangement may be employed as long as the liquid can be<br>
supplied between optical member (tip lens) 91 at the tip of<br>
projection optical system PL and wafer W.  For example, the<br>
liquid immersion mechanism disclosed in the pamphlet of<br>
International Publication No. WO2004/053955, or the liquid<br>
immersion mechanism disclosed in the European Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 1420298 description may also be<br>
applied to the exposure apparatus in this embodiment.<br>
Stage unit 150 is equipped with a frame caster FC, a base<br>
platform 12 arranged on frame caster FC, wafer stage WST and<br>
measurement stage MST arranged above the upper surface of base<br>
platform 12, an interferometer system 118 (refer to Fig. 6)<br>
that includes interferometers 16 and 18 for measuring the<br>
positions of stage WST and stage MST, and a stage drive system<br>
124 (refer to Fig.6) for driving stages WST and MST.<br>
As is obvious from Fig. 2, which is a perspective view<br>
of stage unit 150, frame caster FC is composed of a roughly<br>
plate-shaped member, on which protruding sections FCa and FCb<br>
whose longitudinal direction is in the Y-axis direction are<br>
integrally formed in the vicinity of the edge sections on both<br>
sides in the X-axis direction.<br>
Base platform 12 is composed of a plate-shaped member,<br>
which is also referred to as a surface table, and is arranged<br>
on an area between protruding sections FCa and FCb of frame<br>
caster FC. The degree of flatness of the upper surface of base<br>
platform 12 is extremely high, and the upper surface serves<br>
as a guide surface when wafer stage WST and measurement stage<br>
MST move.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2, wafer stage WST is equipped with<br>
22<br><br>
a wafer stage main body 28 arranged above base platform 12,<br>
and a wafer table WTB mounted on wafer stage main body 28 via<br>
a Z-tilt drive mechanism (not shown) . In actual, Z-tilt drive<br>
mechanism includes three actuators (e.g., voice coil motors)<br>
or the like that support wafer table WTB on wafer stage main<br>
body 28, and Z-tilt drive mechanism finely drives wafer table<br>
WTB in directions of three degrees of freedom, in the Z-axis<br>
direction, a 9x direction (rotation direction around the<br>
X-axis), and a 9y direction (rotation direction around the<br>
Y-axis).<br>
Wafer stage main body 2 8 is composed of a hollow member<br>
extending in the X-axis direction that has a rectangular framed<br>
sectional shape . On the lower surface of wafer stage main body<br>
28, a plurality of (e.g., four) gas hydrostatic bearings (not<br>
shown) such as air bearings is arranged, and wafer stage WST<br>
is supported in a non-contact manner via the bearings, via<br>
a clearance of around several μm above the guide surface<br>
previously described.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2, above protruding section FCa of<br>
frame caster FC, a Y-axis stator 8 6 is arranged, extending<br>
in the Y-axis direction. Similarly, above protruding section<br>
FCb of frame caster FC, a Y-axis stator 87 is arranged,<br>
extending in the Y-axis direction. Y-axis stators 8 6 and 87<br>
are supported by levitation by the gas hydrostatic bearings<br>
(not shown) such as air bearings arranged on the lower surface<br>
of the stators, via a predetermined clearance with respect<br>
to the upper surface of protruding sections FCa and FCb. In<br>
the embodiment, Y-axis stators 8 6 and 87 are each configured<br>
by a magnetic pole unit that has a plurality of permanent<br>
23<br><br>
magnets arranged along the Y-axis direction at a predetermined<br>
distance.<br>
Inside wafer stage main body 28, a mover 90 is installed,<br>
consisting of a magnetic pole unit whose cross-sectional shape<br>
resembles the letter U and having a plurality of permanent<br>
magnets arranged along the X-axis direction at a predetermined<br>
distance.<br>
In the space inside mover 90, an X-axis stator 80<br>
extending in the X-axis direction is inserted. X-axis stator<br>
80 is configured by an armature unit that has a plurality of<br>
armature coils arranged along the X-axis direction at a<br>
predetermined distance.  In this case, mover 90 consisting of<br>
the magnetic pole unit and X-axis stator 80 consisting of the<br>
armature unit constitute a moving magnet type X-axis linear<br>
motor that drives wafer stage WST in the X-axis direction.<br>
Hereinafter, the X-axis linear motor will be appropriately<br>
referred to as an X-axis linear motor 80, using the same<br>
reference numeral as its stator (the stator for the X-axis) ,<br>
X-axis stator 80. As the X-axis linear motor, a moving coil<br>
type linear motor may also be used, instead of the moving magnet<br>
type linear motor.<br>
On both ends of X-axis stator 80 in the longitudinal<br>
direction, for example, movers 82 and 83 consisting of armature<br>
units incorporated with a plurality of armature coils arranged<br>
along the Y-axis direction at a predetermined distance are<br>
respectively fixed. Movers 82 and 83 are each inserted into<br>
Y-axis stators 8 6 and 87 from the inside. That is, in the<br>
embodiment, movers 82 and 83 consisting of the armature units<br>
and Y-axis stators 8 6 and 87 consisting of the magnetic pole<br>
24<br><br>
units constitute two Y-axis linear motors of a moving coil<br>
type. Hereinafter, the two Y-axis linear motors will be<br>
appropriately referred to as Y-axis linear motor 82 and Y-axis<br>
linear motor 83, using the same reference numerals as the<br>
movers, Y-axis movers 82 and 83. As the Y-axis linear motors<br>
82 and 83, linear motors of the moving magnet type may also<br>
be used.<br>
That is, wafer stage WST is driven in the X-axis<br>
direction by X-axis liner motor 80, and is also driven in the<br>
Y-axis direction integrally with X-axis linear motor 80 by<br>
the pair of Y-axis linear motors 82 and 83.  In addition, by<br>
slightly changing the drive force in the Y-axis direction<br>
generated by Y-axis linear motors 82 and 83, wafer stage WST<br>
can also be rotationally driven in the 0z direction.<br>
As is shown in the planar view of Fig. 4, wafer table<br>
WTB is virtually a square shape in a planar view, and on the<br>
upper surface, a wafer holder WH by the pin chuck method that<br>
holds wafer W and a plate holder PH is arranged.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 4, wafer holder WH is equipped with<br>
a plurality of first pins 32 arranged at a predetermined<br>
distance within a circular area of a predetermined dimension<br>
in the center of the upper surface of wafer table WTB, a first<br>
rim section 30 consisting of a ring-shaped protruding section<br>
that surrounds the circular area in which the plurality of<br>
first pins are arranged, three cylindrical shaped second rim<br>
sections 35A, 35B, and 35C that are respectively projecting<br>
at the apex positions of a virtually equilateral triangle where<br>
the distance from the center of the circular area (holder<br>
center) is the same, and the like. The tip of each of the first<br>
25<br><br>
pins 32 and the upper end surface of the second rim sections<br>
35A, 35B, and 35C are set at substantially the same height.<br>
In each of the inner circumference of the second rim<br>
sections 35A, 35B, and 35C, a through hole 39 that has a<br>
circular shape in a planar view is formed, and inside through<br>
holes 39, vertical movement pins (center ups) 34a, 34b, and<br>
34c that have a columnar shape are respectively arranged<br>
movable in the vertical direction (the Z-axis direction, which<br>
is the direction orthogonal to the page surface of Fig. 4).<br>
The three center ups 34a to 34c can be moved up and down in<br>
the vertical direction (the Z-axis direction, which is the<br>
direction orthogonal to the page surface of Fig. 4)<br>
simultaneously by the same amount, via a vertical movement<br>
mechanism (not shown) that constitutes a part of stage drive<br>
system 124 (refer to Fig.6). On wafer loading/unloading, by<br>
center ups 34a to 34c being driven by the vertical movement<br>
mechanism, wafer W can be supported from below by center ups<br>
34a to 34c, or can be vertically moved in the supported state.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 4, in the circular area surrounded<br>
by the first rim section 30 on the upper surface of wafer table<br>
WTB, a plurality of exhaust ports 36 are formed, arranged<br>
radially (in three radial line directions spaced apart at a<br>
center angle of substantially 120°) from the center of the<br>
circular area (holder center) at a predetermined distance.<br>
Exhaust ports 36 are formed at positions that do not interfere<br>
with the first pins 32. Each exhaust port 36 connects to<br>
exhaust paths 38A, 38B, and 38C, which are formed inside wafer<br>
table WTB, via the piping directly under the ports, and exhaust<br>
paths 38A, 38B, and 38C connect to a first vacuum exhaust<br>
26<br><br>
mechanism 44 (refer to Fig. 6) , via vacuum exhaust piping 41a,<br>
41b, and 41c, respectively.<br>
In the embodiment, when wafer W is loaded on wafer holder<br>
WH on wafer table WTB, main controller 2 0 begins a vacuum<br>
exhaust operation via the first vacuum exhaust mechanism 44.<br>
And, by this operation, a negative state is created inside<br>
the space surrounded by wafer W, the first rim section 30,<br>
and the three second rim sections 35A, 35B, and 35C, and wafer<br>
W is held by suction by the plurality of the first pins 32,<br>
the first rim section 30, and the three second rim sections<br>
35A, 35B, and 35C.<br>
On the upper surface of wafer table WTB on the outer side<br>
of the first rim section 30, a third rim section 45 is formed,<br>
consisting of a ring-shaped protruding section concentric<br>
with the first rim section 30. On the outer side of the third<br>
rim section 45, a depressed section 49 is formed whose inner<br>
side is divided by the third rim section 45 and the outer side<br>
is surrounded by an outer partition wall 48 of wafer table<br>
WTB . On the inner bottom surface of depressed section 49,<br>
a plurality of second pins 53 whose tips are substantially<br>
the same height as the third rim section 45 and outer partition<br>
wall 48 is arranged at a predetermined distance. In this case,<br>
the height of the upper end surface of the third rim section<br>
45 and outer partition wall 48 is set a little lower than the<br>
height of the first rim section 30. And, on the third rim<br>
section 45, outer partition wall 48, and the plurality of<br>
second pins 53 that are configured as is described above, a<br>
substantially square liquid-repellent plate (e.g., a<br>
water-repellent plate) 50 that has a circular opening 50a in<br>
27<br><br>
the center is detachably mounted. Liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
is mounted on wafer table WTB in a state where the entire outer<br>
periphery of liquid-repellent plate 50 projects outward a<br>
little than outer partition wall 48. That is, plate holder<br>
PH by the pin chuck method that holds liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 is configured including the third rim section 45, outer<br>
partition wall 48, and the plurality of second pins 53 that<br>
are arranged on the upper surface of wafer table WTB.<br>
In the area constituting a part of plate holder PH,<br>
divided by the third rim section 45 and outer partition wall<br>
48 where the plurality of second pins 53 are arranged, a<br>
plurality of exhaust ports (not shown) are arranged similarly<br>
to wafer holder WH described above at a predetermined distance,<br>
and each exhaust port connects to exhaust paths (not shown)<br>
formed inside wafer table WTB, via the piping directly under<br>
the ports, and these exhaust paths connect to a second vacuum<br>
exhaust mechanism 5 6 shown in Fig. 6, via the respective vacuum<br>
exhaust piping (not shown).<br>
In the embodiment, main controller 2 0 vacuum suctions<br>
the inside of the space surrounded by liquid-repellent plate<br>
50, the third rim section 45, and the outer partition wall<br>
48 (the inner space of depressed section 49) via the second<br>
vacuum exhaust mechanism 5 6, so that the liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 is held by suction by plate holder PH.  In order to<br>
make liquid-repellent plate 50 easily detachable, for example,<br>
vertical movement pins similar to center ups 34a to 34c may<br>
be arranged within the space above, and main controller 20<br>
may control the drive mechanism of the vertical movement pins.<br>
In the embodiment, the height of each parts that<br>
28<br><br>
respectively constitute wafer holder WH and plate holder PH<br>
is set so that the upper surface of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 held by suction on plate holder PH described above and the<br>
surface of wafer W held by suction on wafer holder WH are<br>
substantially flush (refer to Fig. 1) . In addition, the inner<br>
circumferential edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 substantially coincides with the inner circumference wall<br>
of the third rim section 45, when liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
is in a state held by plate holder PH. That is, in the<br>
embodiment, on the inner side of the third rim section 45 and<br>
the inner wall surface of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50, a depressed section 140 where wafer W is loaded is formed,<br>
and in depressed section 140, wafer holder WH is arranged.<br>
In addition, the shape and size of opening 50a is set so that<br>
the clearance between the outer circumferential edge of wafer<br>
W and the inner circumferential edge of opening 50a of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is a value around 0.1 to 0.4 mm.<br>
In addition, in a state where wafer W is held by wafer holder<br>
WH, a surface that appears to be completely flat is formed<br>
on the upper surface of wafer table WTB.<br>
Wafer table WTB is made of a material that has a low<br>
thermal expansion rate, such as ceramics or the like, which<br>
has a certain level of elasticity, and by etching the surface<br>
of a substantially square material such as ceramics, the first<br>
rim section 30, the second rim sections 35A, 35B, and 35C,<br>
the third rim section 45, the plurality of first pins 32, and<br>
the plurality of second pins 53 are integrally formed.<br>
On the surface of liquid-repellent plate 50, a<br>
liquid-repellent treatment (in this case, water-repellent<br>
29<br><br>
treatment such as water-repellent coating) that uses<br>
fluorine-containing material is applied, and a<br>
liquid-repellent surface (a water-repellent surface) is<br>
formed. The liquid-repellent (water-repellent) surface of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is generally sensitive to light in<br>
the far ultraviolet region or the vacuum ultraviolet region,<br>
and the irradiation of exposure light (illumination light)<br>
IL deteriorates the liquid-repellent (water-repellent)<br>
performance.  In addition, because traces of liquid (such as<br>
water marks) may be formed on the upper surface of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50, liquid-repellent plate 50 is made<br>
easily detachable (exchangeable).  Incidentally, besides<br>
than the vacuum suction method, liquid-repellent plate 50 may<br>
also be held by other methods such as the electrostatic suction<br>
method.<br>
In addition, a resist (a photosensitive agent) is coated<br>
on the surface of wafer W.  In the embodiment, as an example,<br>
a photosensitive agent for the ArF excimer laser that has<br>
liquid repellency (water repellency, contact angle 80° to 85°)<br>
is used as the photosensitive agent. As a matter of course,<br>
a material for forming a topcoat layer that has liquid<br>
repellency (contact angle to the liquid, 90° to 120°) may be<br>
coated on this photosensitive agent.  Incidentally, the<br>
surface of wafer W does not necessarily have to be<br>
liquid-repellent, and a resist whose contact angle to the<br>
liquid is around 60° to 80° may also be used.  In addition,<br>
the liquid-repellent treatment may be applied also to the side<br>
surface and a part of the back surface of wafer W. Similarly,<br>
the liquid-repellent treatment may be applied also to at least<br>
30<br><br>
a part of wafer holder WH and plate holder PH.<br>
The position of wafer table WTB configured in the manner<br>
described above is measured by interferometer system 118<br>
(refer to Fig. 6).  Details on the measurement will be<br>
described later in the description.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2, measurement stage MST is<br>
configured combining a plurality of components such as a Y<br>
stage 81 whose longitudinal direction is the X-axis direction.<br>
Measurement stage MST is supported in a non-contact manner<br>
via a clearance of several μm above the upper surface (guide<br>
surface) of base platform 12 via a plurality of gas hydrostatic<br>
bearings such as air bearings arranged in the lowest surface<br>
(the lower surface of the member closest to base platform 12) .<br>
As is obvious from the perspective view in Fig. 3,<br>
measurement stage MST is equipped with a measurement stage<br>
main body 81c that has a rectangular plate shape extending<br>
narrowly in the X-axis direction, Y stage 81 that has a pair<br>
of protruding sections 81a and 81b respectively fixed on both<br>
ends of the upper surface of measurement stage main body 81c<br>
in the X-axis direction, a leveling table 52 arranged above<br>
the upper surface of measurement stage main body 81c, and<br>
measurement table MTB installed on leveling table 52.<br>
On the end surface of both one end and the other end of<br>
measurement stage main body 81c, which constitutes a part of<br>
Y stage 81, in the X-axis direction, movers 84 and 85 consisting<br>
of armature units that incorporate a plurality of armature<br>
coils arranged along the Y-axis direction at a predetermined<br>
distance are respectively fixed. Movers 84 and 85 are<br>
inserted inside Y-axis stators 86 and 87, respectively. That<br>
31<br><br>
is, in the embodiment, movers 84 and 85 consisting of armature<br>
units and Y-axis stators 8 6 and 87 consisting of magnetic pole<br>
units in which movers 84 and 85 are respectively inserted<br>
constitute two moving coil type Y-axis linear motors.<br>
Hereinafter, the two Y-axis linear motors described above will<br>
be appropriately referred to as Y-axis linear motor 84 and<br>
Y-axis linear motor 85, using the same reference numerals as<br>
the movers 84 and 85.  In the embodiment, Y-axis linear motors<br>
8 4 and 85 drive the entire measurement stage MST in the Y-axis<br>
direction. As the Y-axis linear motors 82 and 83, linear<br>
motors of the moving magnet type may also be used.<br>
On the bottom surface of measurement stage main body 81c,<br>
the plurality of gas hydrostatic bearings is arranged. On the<br>
upper surface of measurement stage main body 81c on both one<br>
side and the other side in the X-axis direction on the edge<br>
near the +Y side, the pair of protruding sections 81a and 81b<br>
is fixed facing each other. In between protruding sections<br>
81a and 81b, stators 61 and 63 each extending in the X-axis<br>
direction within the XY plane are installed, arranged in the<br>
Z-axis direction (vertically) at a predetermined distance.<br>
On the end surface of leveling table 52 on the +X side,<br>
a mover of an X voice coil motor 54a is arranged, and the stator<br>
of X voice coil motor 54a is fixed to the upper surface of<br>
measurement stage main body 81c. Further, on the end surface<br>
of leveling table 52 on the -Y side, movers of Y voice coil<br>
motors 54b and 54c are respectively arranged, and the stators<br>
of Y voice coil motors 54b and 54c are fixed to the upper surface<br>
of measurement stage main body 81c. X voice coil motor 54a<br>
is configured of, for example, a mover composed of a magnetic<br>
32<br><br>
pole unit and a stator composed of an armature unit, and a<br>
drive force in the X-axis direction is generated by an<br>
electromagnetic interaction between the mover and the stator.<br>
In addition, Y voice coil motors 54b and 54c are also similarly<br>
configured, and a drive force in the Y-axis direction is<br>
generated. That is, leveling table 52 is driven in the X-axis<br>
direction with respect to Y stage 81 by X voice coil motor<br>
54a, as well as in the Y-axis direction with respect to Y stage<br>
81 by Y voice coil motors 54b and 54c. In addition, by slightly<br>
changing the drive force generated by Y voice coil motors 54b<br>
and 54c, leveling table 52 can also be rotationally driven<br>
around the Z-axis (the 6z direction) with respect to Y stage<br>
81.<br>
Inside leveling table 52, three Z voice coil motors<br>
(drawing omitted) are arranged that generate a drive force<br>
in the Z-axis direction.<br>
That is, leveling table 52 is finely drivable in a<br>
non-contact manner in directions of six degrees of freedom<br>
(in the X, Y, Z, 0x, 9y, and 9z directions) by X voice coil<br>
motor 54a, Y voice coil motors 54b and 54c, and the Z voice<br>
coil motors (not shown) arranged inside leveling table 52.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 3, measurement table MTB is<br>
equipped with a measurement table main body 59, and movers<br>
62 and 64 that are fixed to the surface of measurement table<br>
main body 59 on the +Y side in a vertical arrangement, the<br>
movers having a rough sectional shape of a letter U whose<br>
longitudinal direction is the X-axis direction.<br>
Mover 62 is equipped with a mover yoke that has a rough<br>
U-shape in a YZ section, and a permanent magnet group<br>
33<br><br>
consisting of a plurality of sets of an N-pole permanent magnet<br>
and a S-pole permanent magnet alternately arranged at a<br>
predetermined distance along the X-axis direction on the inner<br>
surface (the upper and lower surface) of the mover yoke, and<br>
is in a state engaged with stator 61 previously described.<br>
In the inner space of the mover yoke of mover 62, an alternating<br>
magnetic field is formed along the X-axis direction. Stator<br>
61, for example, consists of an armature unit that incorporates<br>
a plurality of armature coils arranged at a predetermined<br>
distance along the X-axis direction. That is, stator 61 and<br>
mover 62 constitute a moving magnet type X-axis linear motor<br>
LX that drives measurement table MTB in the X-axis direction.<br>
Mover 64 is equipped with a mover yoke that has a rough<br>
U-shape in the YZ section, and an N-pole permanent magnet and<br>
a S-pole permanent magnet arranged one by one on the inner<br>
surface (the upper and lower surface) of the mover yoke, and<br>
is in a state engaged with stator 63 previously described.<br>
In the inner space of the mover yoke of mover 64, a magnetic<br>
field is formed in the +Z direction (or the -Z direction) .<br>
Stator 63 is equipped with an armature coil, which is arranged<br>
in an arrangement where the current flows only in the X-axis<br>
direction in a magnetic field formed by the N-pole magnet and<br>
the S-pole magnet. That is, mover 64 and stator 63 constitute<br>
a moving magnet type Y voice coil motor VY that drives<br>
measurement table MTB in the Y-axis direction.<br>
As is obvious from the description so far, in the<br>
embodiment, Y-axis linear motors 82 to 85, X-axis linear motor<br>
80, Z-tilt drive mechanism (not shown) that drives wafer table<br>
WTB, and each of the motors described above on measurement<br>
34<br><br>
stage MST (54a to 54c, LX, VY, and the Z voice coil motor (not<br>
shown)) constitute stage drive system 124 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The various drive mechanisms that constitute stage drive<br>
system 124 operate under the control of main controller 20<br>
shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Measurement table MTB is further equipped with<br>
measurement instruments for performing various measurement<br>
related to exposure. More particularly, as is shown in Fig.<br>
3, on the upper surface of measurement table main body 59,<br>
a plate 101 made of glass material such as Zerodur (brand name<br>
of Schott Corporation) or fused silica glass is arranged. On<br>
plate 101, chrome is coated on substantially the entire surface,<br>
and on plate 101, an area for the measurement instruments,<br>
a high and low reference reflecting surface area used when<br>
measuring reticle transmittance or the like, and a fiducial<br>
mark area on which a plurality of fiducial marks are formed<br>
like the ones disclosed in, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication) No. 5-21314 and the corresponding<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,243,195 description, or in Kokai (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 10-050600 and<br>
the corresponding U.S. Patent No. 6,243,158 description, are<br>
arranged. The fiducial mark area constitutes a measurement<br>
member. The surface of plate 101 is a flat plane. As long<br>
as the national laws in designated states (or elected states) ,<br>
to which this international application is applied, permit,<br>
the above disclosures of the publications and the U.S. Patent<br>
descriptions are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the area for the measurement instruments, patterning<br>
is performed, and various measurement aperture patterns are<br>
35<br><br>
formed. As the measurement aperture patterns, for example,<br>
patterns such as an aerial image measurement pattern (e.g.,<br>
a slit-shaped aperture pattern), an irregular illumination<br>
measurement pinhole aperture pattern, an illuminance<br>
measurement aperture pattern, a wavefront aberration<br>
measurement aperture pattern, and the like are formed.<br>
Inside measurement table main body 59 under the aerial<br>
image measurement pattern, a light-receiving system is<br>
arranged, which receives exposure light (illumination light)<br>
IL via the aerial image measurement pattern, irradiated on<br>
plate 101 via projection optical system and the water. The<br>
light-receiving system constitutes an aerial image<br>
measurement instrument, which measures the light intensity<br>
of an aerial image (projected image) of a pattern projected<br>
by projection optical system PL. The details of the<br>
instrument are disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 2002-14005 and<br>
the corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br>
2002/0041377 Description. As long as the national laws in<br>
designated states (or elected states), to which this<br>
international application is applied, permit, the above<br>
disclosures of the publication and the U.S. Patent application<br>
description are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Further, inside measurement table main body 59 under the<br>
irregular illumination measurement pinhole aperture pattern,<br>
a light-receiving system that includes a light-receiving<br>
element is arranged. The light-receiving system including<br>
the light-receiving element constitutes an irregular<br>
illuminance measurement instrument, which has a<br>
36<br><br>
pinhole-shaped light-receiving section that receives<br>
illumination light IL on the image plane of projection optical<br>
system PL. The details of the instrument are disclosed in,<br>
for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication) No. 57-117238 and the corresponding U.S. Patent<br>
Publication No. 4,465,368 Description. As long as the<br>
national laws in designated states (or elected states), to<br>
which this international application is applied, permit, the<br>
above disclosures of the publication and the U.S. Patent<br>
description are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Further, inside measurement table main body 59 under the<br>
illuminance measurement aperture pattern, a light-receiving<br>
system that includes a light-receiving element is arranged.<br>
The light-receiving system including the light-receiving<br>
element constitutes an illuminance monitor, which has a<br>
light-receiving section of a predetermined area that receives<br>
illumination light IL on the image plane of projection optical<br>
system PL via the water. The details of the instrument are<br>
disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication) No. 11-16816 and the corresponding<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0061469<br>
Description. As long as the national laws in designated<br>
states (or elected states), to which this international<br>
application is applied, permit, the above disclosures of the<br>
publication and the U.S. Patent application description are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Further, inside measurement table main body 59 under the<br>
wavefront aberration measurement aperture pattern, for<br>
example, a light-receiving system that includes a microlens<br>
37<br><br>
array is arranged. The light-receiving system including the<br>
microlens array constitutes a wavefront aberration<br>
measurement instrument. The details of the instrument are<br>
disclosed in, for example, the pamphlet of International<br>
Publication No. WO99/60361, and the corresponding European<br>
Patent Publication No. 1,079,223 Description. As long as the<br>
national laws in designated states (or elected states), to<br>
which this international application is applied, permit, the<br>
above disclosures of the publication and the European Patent<br>
description are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In Fig. 6, the aerial image measurement instrument, the<br>
irregular illumination measurement instrument, the<br>
illuminance monitor, and the wavefront aberration measurement<br>
instrument described above are shown as measurement<br>
instrument group 43.<br>
In the embodiment, in response to the immersion exposure<br>
where wafer W is exposed by exposure light (illumination light)<br>
IL via projection optical system PL and the water, the<br>
instruments used for measurement as in the illuminance monitor,<br>
the irregular illumination measurement instrument, the aerial<br>
image measurement instrument, and the wavefront aberration<br>
measurement instrument described above that use illumination<br>
light IL will receive illumination light IL via projection<br>
optical system PL and the water . Therefore, a water-repellent<br>
coating may be performed on the surface of plate 101.  In<br>
addition, in each of the measurement instruments described<br>
above, only a part of each measurement instrument, such as<br>
the optical system, may be installed in measurement stage MST,<br>
or the whole instrument may be arranged in measurement stage<br>
38<br><br>
MST. In addition, all of the aerial image measurement<br>
instrument, the irregular illumination measurement<br>
instrument, the illuminance monitor, and the wavefront<br>
aberration measurement instrument described above do not<br>
necessarily have to be equipped, and only a part of the<br>
instruments may be equipped as necessary.<br>
The position of measurement stage MST (measurement table<br>
MTB) that has the arrangement described above is measured by<br>
interferometer system 118 (refer to Fig. 6), which will be<br>
described later in the description.<br>
In addition, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
as the holding member that holds projection unit PU, an<br>
off-axis alignment system (hereinafter shortly referred to<br>
as 'alignment system') ALG as is shown in Fig. 1 is arranged.<br>
As alignment system ALG, for example, a sensor of an FIA (Field<br>
Image Alignment) system based on an image-processing method<br>
is used. This sensor irradiates a broadband detection beam<br>
that does not expose the resist on the wafer on an object mark,<br>
picks up an image of the object mark formed on the<br>
photodetection surface by the reflection light from the object<br>
mark and an image (not shown) of an index (an index pattern<br>
on an index plate arranged within alignment system ALG) with<br>
a pick-up device (such as a CCD), and outputs the imaging<br>
signals.  Details on such a system are disclosed in, for<br>
example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication) No.2001-257157 and its corresponding U.S . Patent<br>
Application Publication No.2001/0023918 description, Kokai<br>
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication)<br>
No.8-213306 and its corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,783,833<br>
39<br><br>
description, or the like. The imaging signals from alignment<br>
system ALG are sent to main controller 20 in Fig. 6. As long<br>
as the national laws in designated states or elected states,<br>
to which this international application is applied, permit,<br>
the above disclosures of the publications and the U.S. Patent<br>
application publication description and the U.S. Patent are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As alignment system ALG, the system is not limited to<br>
the FIA system, and it is naturally possible to use an alignment<br>
sensor that irradiates a coherent detection light on an object<br>
mark and detects the scattered light or diffracted light<br>
generated from the object mark, or a sensor that detects two<br>
diffracted lights (for example, the same order) generated from<br>
an object mark that are made to interfere independently, or<br>
appropriately combined.<br>
For members arranged in the vicinity of the movement<br>
plane of wafer table WTB on which the liquid may adhere when<br>
the liquid disperses, such as the optical elements of alignment<br>
system ALG or the holding member that holds the optical<br>
elements, a waterproof cover may be arranged. In addition,<br>
in a gap where there is a risk of the liquid entering inside<br>
alignment system ALG such as between an optical element and<br>
a holding member that holds the optical element, a seal member<br>
such as an O-ring is arranged. Furthermore, the surface of<br>
the optical members arranged in the vicinity of the movement<br>
plane of wafer table WTB, such as the surface of the optical<br>
element at the tip (lower end) of alignment system ALG and<br>
the surface of the mirror used by the interferometer fixed<br>
to alignment system ALG, is coated with a liquid-repellent<br>
40<br><br>
material, which not only prevents the water from adhering,<br>
but also allows the operator to easily wipe off the water when<br>
the water adheres.<br>
Furthermore, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
although it is omitted in Fig. 1, a multiple point focal<br>
position detection system based on an oblique method including<br>
an irradiation system 90a and a photodetection system 90b<br>
(refer to Fig. 6) , similar to the one disclosed in, for example,<br>
Kokai (Japanese Patent Unexamined Application Publication)<br>
No. 6-283403 and the corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,448,332<br>
description, is arranged.  In the embodiment, as an example,<br>
irradiation system 90a is supported by suspension on the -X<br>
side of projection unit PU by a holding member that holds<br>
projection unit PU, while photodetection system 90b is also<br>
supported by suspension under the holding member on the +X<br>
side of projection unit PU. That is, irradiation system 90a<br>
and photodetection system 90b, and projection optical system<br>
PL are attached to the same member, and the positional relation<br>
between the two is constantly maintained. As long as the<br>
national laws in designated states or elected states, to which<br>
this international application is applied, permit, the above<br>
disclosures of the publication and the U.S. Patent description<br>
are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Next, the configuration and the operation of<br>
interferometer system 118 will be described.<br>
The end surfaces of wafer table WTB are mirror-polished<br>
on the -X side and the -Y side, and as is shown in Fig. 2,<br>
reflection surfaces 17X and 17Y are formed. In addition, the<br>
end surfaces of measurement table MTB are mirror-polished on<br>
41<br><br>
the -X side, and the +Y side and the -Y side, and reflection<br>
surfaces 117X, and 117Y1 and 117Y2 are formed.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 5, interferometer system 118 includes<br>
Y-axis interferometers 16, 18, and 78, and X-axis<br>
interferometers 46, 66, and 76.<br>
Y-axis interferometers 16 and 18 both have measurement<br>
axes that are parallel to the Y-axis connecting the projection<br>
center of projection optical system PL (optical axis AX) and<br>
the detection center of alignment system ALG. Y-axis<br>
interferometers 16 and 18 are both multi-axis interferometers<br>
that have at least three optical axes, and the output values<br>
of each optical axis can be independently measured.  In<br>
addition, X-axis interferometer 4 6 has measurement axes that<br>
perpendicularly intersect with the measurement axes of Y-axis<br>
interferometers 16 and 18 at the projection center of<br>
projection optical system PL.  In addition, X-axis<br>
interferometer 66 has measurement axes that perpendicularly<br>
intersect with the measurement axes of Y-axis interferometers<br>
16 and 18 at the detection center of alignment system AGL.<br>
X-axis interferometers 46 and 66 are both multi-axis<br>
interferometers that have at least two optical axes, and the<br>
output values of each optical axis can be independently<br>
measured. The output values (measurement values) of the above<br>
four interferometers 16, 18, 46, and 66 are sent to main<br>
controller 20 shown in Fig. 6. For example, in the state shown<br>
in Fig. 5, the interferometer beam (measurement beam) from<br>
Y-axis interferometer 16 is projected on reflection surface<br>
117Y1 of measurement table MTB while the interferometer beam<br>
(measurement beam) from Y-axis interferometer 18 is projected<br>
42<br><br>
on reflection surface 17Y of wafer table WTB, and the<br>
interferometer beam (measurement beam) from X-axis<br>
interferometer 46 is projected on reflection surface 117X of<br>
measurement table MTB while the interferometer beam<br>
(measurement beam) from X-axis interferometer 66 is projected<br>
on reflection surface 17X of wafer table WTB. And by<br>
respectively receiving the reflection beams of the<br>
measurement beams of the optical axis of each interferometer<br>
from each reflection surf ace, interferometers 16, 18, 46, and<br>
66 measure the displacement for each optical axis in the<br>
measurement direction from the reference position (normally,<br>
a fixed mirror is arranged on the side surface of projection<br>
unit PU or off-axis alignment system ALG (refer to Figs. 6<br>
and 5) , which serves as a reference plane) of each reflection<br>
surface.<br>
In the case of Fig. 5, based on the output values of Y-axis<br>
interferometer 18, main controller 20 measures not only the<br>
position of wafer table WTB in the Y-axis direction (the Y<br>
position), but also the rotation amount around the X-axis<br>
(pitching amount) and the rotation amount around the Z-axis<br>
(yawing amount). In addition, based on the output values of<br>
Y-axis interferometer 16, main controller 20 measures not only<br>
the position of measurement table MTB in the Y-axis direction<br>
(the Y position), but also the rotation amount around the<br>
X-axis (pitching amount) and the rotation amount around the<br>
Z-axis (yawing amount).  Further, based on the output values<br>
(measurement values) of X-axis interferometer 66, main<br>
controller 20 measures not only the position of wafer table<br>
WTB in the X-axis direction (the X position), but also the<br>
43<br><br>
rotation amount around the Y-axis (rolling amount).<br>
Furthermore, based on the output values (measurement values)<br>
of X-axis interferometer 46, main controller 20 measures the<br>
X position and the rolling amount of measurement table MTB.<br>
As is obvious from Fig. 5, in the embodiment, the<br>
interferometer beam from Y-axis interferometer 18 is<br>
constantly projected on a movable mirror 17Y in the entire<br>
movement range of wafer stage WST on alignment and on exposure,<br>
whereas the interferometer beam from Y-axis interferometer<br>
16 is constantly projected on a movable mirror 117Y1 in the<br>
entire movement range of measurement stage MST. Accordingly,<br>
for the Y-axis direction, the Y position of stages WST and<br>
MST is controlled by main controller 20 based on the<br>
measurement values of Y-axis interferometers 18 and 16, except<br>
for the case when wafer stage WST moves to the wafer exchange<br>
position shown by the double-dotted line in Fig. 5.<br>
Meanwhile, as is obvious from Figs. 2 and 5, main<br>
controller 20 controls the X position of wafer table WTB (wafer<br>
stage WST) based on the output of X-axis interferometer 4 6<br>
within the range where only the interferometer beam from X-axis<br>
interferometer 46 irradiates reflection surface 17X, while<br>
controlling the X position of measurement table MTB<br>
(measurement stage MST) based on the output of X-axis<br>
interferometer 4 6 within the range where only the<br>
interferometer beam from X-axis interferometer 46 irradiates<br>
reflection surface 117X.  In addition, main controller 20<br>
controls the X position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST)<br>
based on the output of X-axis interferometer 66 within the<br>
range where only the interferometer beam from X-axis<br>
44<br><br>
interferometer 66 irradiates reflection surface 17X, while<br>
controlling the X position of measurement table MTB<br>
(measurement stage MST) based on the output of X-axis<br>
interferometer 66 within the range where only the<br>
interferometer beam from X-axis interferometer 66 irradiates<br>
reflection surface 117X.<br>
In addition, in the range including where the<br>
interferometer beams from both X-axis interferometer 46 and<br>
X-axis interferometer 66 irradiate reflection surface 17X,<br>
main controller 20 controls the X position of wafer table WTB<br>
(wafer stage WST) on wafer alignment using X-axis<br>
interferometer 66, whereas main controller 20 also controls<br>
the X position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) on exposure<br>
using X-axis interferometer 46. Accordingly, on both wafer<br>
alignment and on exposure, the X position of wafer table WTB<br>
(wafer stage WST) can be controlled without any Abbe errors.<br>
The remaining X-axis interferometer 76 and Y-axis<br>
interferometer 78 are interferometers that are used to control<br>
the position of wafer stage WST when wafer stage WST is located<br>
in the vicinity of the wafer exchange position, which is<br>
outside the control of interferometers 46, 66, and 18. Main<br>
controller 20 controls the position of wafer table WTB (wafer<br>
stage WST) based on the measurement values of interferometers<br>
76 and 78, during the period when the X position cannot be<br>
controlled based on the output values of interferometers 46,<br>
66, and 18.<br>
In addition, when measurement stage MST is at a waiting<br>
position further on the +Y side than the state in Fig. 5, the<br>
interferometer beams of both X-axis interferometer 66 and<br>
45<br><br>
X-axis interferometer 46 do not irradiate reflection surface<br>
117X. When measurement stage MST moves from this state in the<br>
-Y direction, immediately after the point when the<br>
interferometer beam of X-axis interferometer 4 6 begins to<br>
irradiate reflection surface 117X from the state where it does<br>
not irradiate reflection surface 117X, main controller 20<br>
resets X-axis interferometer 4 6, which has not been used so<br>
far for control, and thereinafter, controls the X position<br>
of measurement table MTB (measurement stage MST) using X-axis<br>
interferometer 46. The other interferometers can perform<br>
reset (seamless reset) operation using the output<br>
(measurement values) of adjacent interferometers. That is,<br>
immediately before resetting each interferometer, at the<br>
point where the measurement beams from adjacent two<br>
interferometers simultaneously begins to irradiate the<br>
reflection surface, by resetting (presetting) the<br>
interferometer subject to reset with the measurement values<br>
of the X-axis interferometer or the Y-axis interferometer that<br>
has been used for position control of wafer stage WST or<br>
measurement stage MST carried over, the position of wafer stage<br>
WST and measurement stage MST can be controlled using the<br>
interferometer that has been reset without any problems. As<br>
a matter of course, when measurement table MTB is at a waiting<br>
position, an interferometer for measuring the X-axis position<br>
of measurement table MTB may be added.<br>
Furthermore, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
the wafer exchange position (the loading position) is decided<br>
at a position in the movable range of wafer stage WST in the<br>
vicinity of the edge section on the +X side and the vicinity<br>
46<br><br>
of the edge section on the -Y side, and reticle alignment and<br>
baseline measurement of alignment system ALG are to be<br>
performed when wafer stage WST is located at the wafer exchange<br>
position. When wafer stage WST is at the wafer exchange<br>
position, because the interferometer beam (measurement beam)<br>
from Y-axis interferometer 18 irradiates reflection surface<br>
117Y2 of measurement table MTB, main controller 20 resets the<br>
measurement values of Y-axis interferometer 18 prior to the<br>
irradiation. And then, main controller 20 begins the series<br>
of operations related to reticle alignment and baseline<br>
measurement of alignment system ALG, while controlling the<br>
position of measurement table MTB using the Y-axis<br>
interferometer 18 that has been reset and X-axis<br>
interferometer 46. This is because by measuring the baseline<br>
using fiducial mark area FM on measurement table MTB previously<br>
described while controlling the position of measurement table<br>
MTB using Y-axis interferometer 18, which is used for measuring<br>
the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) on wafer<br>
alignment and exposure, and by performing position control<br>
of wafer table WTB on exposure using the baseline that has<br>
been measured, position errors caused by the difference in<br>
interferometers used for control can be kept from occurring.<br>
In the embodiment, on reticle alignment, main controller<br>
20 controls the open/close operation of each valve in liquid<br>
supply unit 8 8 and liquid recovery unit 92 of liquid immersion<br>
mechanism 132 as is previously described, and water Lq is<br>
constantly filled in the space between tip lens 91 of<br>
projection optical system PL and fiducial mark area FA of<br>
measurement table MTB. Then, main controller 2 0 detects the<br>
47<br><br>
relative position (a first relative position) between at least<br>
a pair of reticle alignment marks on reticle R and at least<br>
a pair of first fiducial marks on fiducial mark area FM, using<br>
reticle alignment detection systems RAa and RAb, and then after<br>
the detection, moves measurement table MTB based on the design<br>
values of the baseline until fiducial mark area FM comes<br>
directly under alignment system ALG. Then, in a state where<br>
water Lq does not exist on fiducial mark area FM, main<br>
controller 20 detects a second fiducial mark on fiducial mark<br>
area FM using alignment system ALG, and the relative position<br>
(a second relative position) between the detection center of<br>
alignment system ALG and the second fiducial mark. Then, main<br>
controller 20 calculates the baseline of alignment system ALG,<br>
based on the first relative position, the second relative<br>
position, the design values of the baseline, and the positional<br>
relation between the pair of first fiducial marks and the<br>
second fiducial mark.<br>
In the embodiment, the three Y-axis interferometers 16,<br>
18, and 78 and the three X-axis interferometers 46, 66, and<br>
7 6 constitute interferometer system 118. However, the<br>
configuration of such an interferometer system is a mere<br>
example, and the present invention is naturally not limited<br>
to this.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, in exposure apparatus 100, a<br>
carrier arm 70 is arranged that carries wafer W to wafer stage<br>
WST. Carrier arm 7 0 may be an arm by a slide method or a robot<br>
arm of a horizontal multijoint type, as long as it carries<br>
the wafer between a pre-alignment unit (not shown) that detects<br>
the center position and the rotation angle of the wafer and<br>
48<br><br>
wafer stage WST located at the wafer exchange position. In<br>
the embodiment, a carrier system 72 (refer to Fig. 6) that<br>
carries the wafer to wafer stage WST is configured, including<br>
carrier arm 70, the pre-alignment unit (not shown), a carrier<br>
section that carries the wafer to the pre-alignment unit from<br>
the outside, and the like.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the main configuration of a control system<br>
of exposure apparatus 100. The control system is mainly<br>
composed of main controller 20, which is made up of a<br>
microcomputer (or a workstation) that has overall control over<br>
the entire apparatus.<br>
As is described above, the position of wafer table WTB<br>
and measurement table MTB within the XY plane can be measured<br>
at a resolution of 0.5 to 1 nm by each interferometer of<br>
interferometer system 118, however, because there are no<br>
reference marks for position measurement on liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 in the embodiment, for example, it becomes difficult<br>
to restore wafer table WTB to a reference state (or to a state<br>
before the last interferometer beam moves away from wafer table<br>
WTB) after at least one interferometer has been reset, after<br>
the interferometer beams from all the Y-axis interferometers<br>
or all the X-axis interferometers move off the reflection<br>
surface of wafer table WTB. In addition, in the embodiment,<br>
because the periphery of liquid-repellent plate 50 projects<br>
outside wafer table WTB (reflection surface) , it is difficult<br>
to control the position of wafer table WTB so that the outer<br>
periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 does not touch<br>
other members. It is difficult to control the position of<br>
wafer table WTB, especially immediately after when<br>
49<br><br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is exchanged. In consideration of<br>
such points, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment, main<br>
controller 20 measures the position of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 in the manner described below, and controls the position<br>
of wafer table WTB based on the measurement results.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an example of a flowchart of a processing<br>
algorithm of (the CPU inside) main controller 20 when the<br>
restoring operation of wafer table WTB to a reference state<br>
is performed, after liquid-repellent plate 50 has been<br>
exchanged. The processing algorithm is to begin when wafer<br>
stage WST moves to the position shown in Fig. 8, immediately<br>
after the measurement values of interferometer 18 have been<br>
reset. At this stage, the position of wafer table WTB is<br>
controlled by main controller 2 0 based on the measurement<br>
values of interferometers 18 and 76. The rotation error of<br>
wafer table WTB itself in the 0z direction is to be small enough<br>
to be ignored. In addition, as is previously described, when<br>
wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) or the like moves, seamless<br>
preset of the measurement values of the interferometers<br>
previously described is performed, however, in the<br>
description of the processing algorithm below, in order to<br>
simplify the description, the description or the like related<br>
to the seamless preset of the measurement values of the<br>
interferometers will be omitted, and the position of wafer<br>
stage WST (wafer table WTB) is to be controlled on a stage<br>
coordinate system (X, Y) set by the measurement axes of<br>
interferometer system 118. There are no serious problems to<br>
such a premise, because the measurement values of adjacent<br>
X-axis interferometers and Y-axis interferometers are<br>
50<br><br>
sequentially carried over by the seamless preset.<br>
First of all, in step 202 in Fig. 7, a counter value n<br>
of a first counter that shows the measurement point number<br>
on the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 is<br>
initialized to 1 (n
subject to measurement, N, or to be more precise, 4 areas in<br>
this case, that is, the points in the center of each edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 vertically and horizontally are to<br>
be set.<br>
In the next step, step 204, wafer stage WST is moved so<br>
that the nth (in this case, the 1st) measurement point on the<br>
outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 is<br>
positioned directly under alignment system ALG, while the<br>
position of wafer table WTB is measured using interferometer<br>
system 118.<br>
Fig. 9A shows the situation when the position of the 1st<br>
measurement point on the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 on wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST)<br>
is set directly under alignment system ALG. In Figs. 9B to<br>
9D, the reference ALG' indicates the imaging field of alignment<br>
system ALG.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 7, in step 206, the nth (in this<br>
case, the 1st) measurement point on the outer periphery edge<br>
is picked up using alignment system ALG, and the imaging data<br>
(imaging signals) is loaded, along with the measurement values<br>
of interferometer system 118 at this point. Both data are made<br>
to correspond with each other, and are stored in memory (not<br>
shown).<br>
In the next step, step 208, the judgment is made whether<br>
51<br><br>
or not counter value n of the first counter has reached N (in<br>
this case, N=4) or not. In this case, since n=l, the judgment<br>
here is denied, and the procedure then moves to step 210 where<br>
counter value n of the first counter is incremented by 1, and<br>
then the procedure returns to step 204.<br>
Hereinafter, the loop processing of steps 204 —&gt; 206 —&gt;<br>
208 —&gt; 210 is repeated until the judgment in step 208 is affirmed.<br>
Accordingly, from the position shown in Fig. 9A, wafer table<br>
WTB is seguentially positioned to each of the positions shown<br>
in FIGS 9B, 9C, and 9D, and the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is picked up using alignment system<br>
ALG, and the imaging data (imaging signals) is stored in memory<br>
with the position information (the measurement values of<br>
interferometer system 118) of wafer table WTB corresponding<br>
to the imaging data.<br>
Then, when loading of the imaging data or the like of<br>
the edge on the -X side of liquid-repellent plate 50 shown<br>
in Fig. 9D is completed, the judgment in step 208 turns positive,<br>
and the procedure then moves to step 212.<br>
In step 212, the position information of the 1st to Nth<br>
(in this case, the 4th) measurement point on the outer periphery<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 is obtained by an image processing<br>
method, based on the imaging data (imaging results) of each<br>
edge stored memory and the corresponding measurement results<br>
of interferometer system 118.<br>
In the next step, step 214, based on the position<br>
information of the outer periphery edge at the obtained N<br>
points (in this case, 4 points), the position information or<br>
the like of liquid-repellent plate 50 such as for example,<br>
52<br><br>
a predetermined reference point (e.g., the center point) of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 on the stage coordinate system (X,<br>
Y) is calculated, and then after such calculation, the<br>
processing in step 216 is performed when necessary, and then<br>
the processing shown in Fig. 7 is completed.<br>
Then, based on the position information of the outer<br>
periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 or the position<br>
information of liquid-repellent 50 measured in the matter<br>
described above, main controller 20 performs position control<br>
of wafer table WTB.  For example, main controller 20 controls<br>
at least one of the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage<br>
WST) and the position of measurement stage MST based the<br>
position information of the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 or the position information of<br>
liquid-repellent 50, so that the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 does not touch measurement stage<br>
WST.<br>
In the case of performing the processing in step 216<br>
above, the position information of a part of the wafer holder<br>
is to be obtained as in the position information of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 previously described, and based on<br>
the position information and the position information of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 obtained in step 212 or step 214<br>
above, the position relation between wafer holder WH (wafer<br>
table WTB) and the liquid-repellent plate is to be calculated.<br>
In the case, for example, the 6z rotation of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is also measured, the measurement<br>
points on the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 are to be set at a plurality of points on at least one edge<br>
53<br><br>
(that is, 5 or more in total) , and then the processing is to<br>
be performed according to a flow chart similar to the one in<br>
Fig. 7 previously described.  Fig. 10A shows the situation<br>
where wafer table WTB is moved when sequentially measuring<br>
the position information of the plurality of measurement<br>
points on the edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 on the +Y side<br>
edge section. And, in this case, in step 214 previously<br>
described, as the position information of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50, in addition to the position information of the<br>
reference point described above, the 0z rotation of the edge<br>
(that is, the rotation angle of liquid-repellent plate 50 with<br>
respect to the stage coordinate system) may also be calculated<br>
based on position information of at least two points on the<br>
edge where the plurality of points subject to measurement are<br>
set.<br>
In this case, the 0z rotation of each edge can be obtained<br>
by setting the plurality of measurement points on each of the<br>
four edges of liquid-repellent plate 50. For example, as in<br>
the pattern shown in Fig. 10B, three measurement points can<br>
be set on each of the four edges and the average value of the<br>
0z rotation for each edge that has been obtained can be obtained.<br>
In actual, imaging field ALG' of alignment system ALG is fixed<br>
and wafer table WTB moves, however, Fig. 10B shows as if imaging<br>
field ALG' moves with respect to wafer table WTB, which is<br>
fixed for the sake of convenience.<br>
In the embodiment, the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is imaged at a plurality of points<br>
including two points symmetry to the virtual center of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50. The imaging places, however, are<br>
54<br><br>
not limited to this, and do not have to be two places symmetry<br>
to the virtual center of liquid-repellent plate 50. For<br>
example, the outer periphery edge may be imaged at a plurality<br>
of points including one point on one edge of the outer periphery<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 and another point on the opposite<br>
edge of the one edge. In this case, because a substantially<br>
symmetric image of at least two outer periphery edges that<br>
oppose each other can be obtained, position information (such<br>
as the center position) of liquid-repellent plate 50 can be<br>
calculated.<br>
Next, a series of processing performed in exposure<br>
apparatus 100 of the embodiment from when the liquid-repellent<br>
plate on wafer table WTB is exchanged until the next exchange<br>
of the liquid-repellent plate is performed is described, based<br>
on the flowchart in Figs. 11 and 12 that show the processing<br>
algorithm of (the CPU inside) main controller 20 while<br>
referring to other drawings as appropriate.  In the<br>
description of the processing algorithm below, descriptions<br>
on seamless preset of the measurement values of the<br>
interferometers previously described will be omitted, and the<br>
position of wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) is to be<br>
controlled on the stage coordinate system (X, Y) set by the<br>
measurement axes of interferometer system 118.<br>
First of all, in step 222 in Fig. 11, a subroutine for<br>
measuring the position information of the inner periphery edge<br>
of the opening of the liquid-repellent plate is performed.<br>
In the subroutine of step 222, firstly, in step 302 in<br>
Fig. 13, a counter value m of a second counter that shows the<br>
order of the measurement points of the inner periphery edge<br>
55<br><br>
of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 is initialized<br>
to 1 (m
case, eight points, which are intersecting points of eight<br>
lines that radially extend in eight directions including the<br>
horizontal and vertical directions at a center angle of 45°<br>
from the center of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
and the inner periphery edge, are decided.<br>
In the next step, step 304, wafer table WTB (wafer stage<br>
WST) is moved so that the mth (in this case, the 1st) measurement<br>
point on the inner periphery edge of opening 50a of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is positioned directly under<br>
alignment system ALG, while the position of wafer table WTB<br>
is measured using interferometer system 118.<br>
Fig. 15A shows the situation when the position of the<br>
1st measurement point is set within the imaging field of<br>
alignment system ALG.  In Figs. 15A to 15D and Figs. 16A to<br>
16D, the reference ALG' indicates the imaging field of<br>
alignment system ALG.<br>
In the next step, step 306, the mth (in this case, the<br>
1st) measurement point on the inner periphery edge of opening<br>
50a is picked up using alignment system ALG, and the imaging<br>
data (imaging signals) is loaded, along with the measurement<br>
values of interferometer system 118 at this point. Both data<br>
are made to correspond with each other, and are stored in memory<br>
(not shown).<br>
In the next step, step 308, the judgment is made whether<br>
or not counter value m of the second counter has reached M<br>
(in this case, M=8) or not.  In this case, since m=l, the<br>
judgment here is denied, and the procedure then moves to step<br>
56<br><br>
310 where counter value m of the second counter is incremented<br>
by 1, and then the procedure returns to step 304.<br>
Hereinafter, the loop processing of steps 304 —&gt; 306 —&gt;<br>
308 —&gt; 310 is repeated until the judgment in step 308 is affirmed.<br>
Accordingly, from the position shown in Fig. 15A, wafer table<br>
WTB is sequentially positioned to each of the positions shown<br>
in FIGS 15B, 15C, 15D, 16A, 16B, 16C, and 16D, and the inner<br>
periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
is picked up using alignment system ALG, and the imaging data<br>
(imaging signals) is stored in memory with the position<br>
information (the measurement values of interferometer system<br>
118) of wafer table WTB corresponding to the imaging data.<br>
Then, when loading of the imaging data or the like of<br>
the 8th measurement point on the inner periphery edge of opening<br>
50a shown in Fig. 16D is completed, the judgment in step 308<br>
turns positive, and the procedure then moves to step 314. As<br>
is modeled in Fig. 17A, the imaging data of the eight points<br>
on the inner periphery edge of opening 50a and the position<br>
information of wafer table WTB corresponding to the imaging<br>
data are stored in memory. In actual, imaging field ALG' of<br>
alignment system ALG is fixed and wafer table WTB moves,<br>
however, Fig. 17A shows as if imaging field ALG' moves with<br>
respect to wafer table WTB, which is fixed for the sake of<br>
convenience.<br>
In step 314, after the position information of the 1st<br>
to the Mth (in this case, the 8th) measurement points on the<br>
inner periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 is obtained by the image processing method, based on the<br>
imaging data (imaging results) of the M points (eight, in this<br>
57<br><br>
case) on the inner periphery edge of opening 50a and<br>
measurement results of interferometer system 118<br>
corresponding to the imaging data that are stored in memory,<br>
the processing in the subroutine is completed, and the<br>
subroutine returns to step 224 (refer to Fig. 11) in the main<br>
routine.<br>
In step 224, based on the position information of the<br>
M points (in this case, eight points) on the inner periphery<br>
edge of opening 50a, for example, position information of<br>
opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 such as the position<br>
information of a predetermined reference point (e.g., the<br>
center point) of opening 50a on the stage coordinate system<br>
(X, Y) is calculated (that is, based on the position<br>
information of the inner periphery edge, the position relation<br>
between the stage coordinate system set by interferometer<br>
system 118 and opening 50a is decided) by the least squares<br>
method or the like, and then the procedure then moves on to<br>
step 226.<br>
In step 226, based on the position information of the<br>
M points (in this case, eight points) on the inner periphery<br>
edge of opening 50a described above, the shape information<br>
(the shape information includes at least the roundness of<br>
opening 50a) of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 is<br>
calculated by a predetermined calculation. Roundness, in<br>
this case, refers to an evaluation amount that shows the<br>
deviation of opening 50a from an ideal perfect circle, and<br>
it can be defined as the difference between the maximum radius<br>
and the minimum radius of the outline of opening 50a with<br>
respect to the center of opening 50a. The center of the circle,<br>
58<br><br>
which is to be the reference of such roundness, may be a center<br>
calculated in one of the methods described below.<br>
a.	minimum zone circle (MZC) method: the center where when<br>
two concentric circles are positioned enclosing the outline<br>
of the opening, the radial departure of the concentric circles<br>
becomes a minimum<br>
b.	least squares mean circle (LSC) method: the center of a<br>
least squares mean circle (a circle whose sum of the squares<br>
of the deviation from a reference circle is minimized)<br>
c.	minimum circumscribed circle (MCC) method:  the center of<br>
a smallest possible circle which can be fitted around the<br>
outline of the opening<br>
d.	maximum inscribed circle (MIC) method: the center of a<br>
circle of maximum radius that is totally enclosed by the<br>
outline of the opening.<br>
In the next step, step 228, the judgment is made whether<br>
or not the roundness calculated in step 226 above is below<br>
a first threshold value or not. A value within in the limit<br>
of use as a liquid-repellent plate is decided as the first<br>
threshold value. Accordingly, in the case the judgment in<br>
step 228 is denied, then it means that liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 is a plate whose level of roundness of the opening formed<br>
is insufficient and cannot be used in the exposure apparatus.<br>
Therefore, the procedure moves to step 264 in Fig. 12 where<br>
a notice, such as, for example, 'liquid-repellent plate defect<br>
(exchange required)' is shown on the display (not shown) so<br>
that the liquid-repellent plate defect is notified to the<br>
operator, and then the processing of the routine is completed.<br>
Then, by confirming the notice (display), the operator stops<br>
59<br><br>
the operation of exposure apparatus 100, and then manually<br>
performs the exchange of liquid-repellent plate 50. In the<br>
case the exposure apparatus is equipped with a robot that can<br>
be used for exchanging liquid-repellent plate 50, main<br>
controller 20 can show the exchange period on the display,<br>
as well as stop the operation of the apparatus and then exchange<br>
the liquid-repellent plate, using the robot.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case the judgment in step 228 is<br>
affirmed, the procedure then moves to the next step, step 230<br>
where the judgment is made of whether the roundness calculated<br>
in step 226 above is below a second threshold value or not.<br>
And, in the case the judgment is denied, the procedure then<br>
moves to step 234 where a tool wafer Wl (refer to Fig. 17B)<br>
is loaded onto wafer holder WH inside opening 50a of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50, using carrier arm 70 in carrier<br>
system 72 and center-ups 34a to 34c previously described.<br>
Then, the procedure moves to step 236 where a subroutine of<br>
measuring position information of the outer periphery edge<br>
of the object in the opening is performed. In this case, tool<br>
wafer Wl is a tool wafer that has a diameter (outer diameter)<br>
slightly smaller than that of wafer W, which is the object<br>
subject to processing used in device manufacturing. On the<br>
contrary, in the case the judgment is affirmed in step 230,<br>
the procedure then moves to step 232 where wafer W is loaded<br>
on wafer WH inside opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50,<br>
using carrier arm 70 in carrier system 72 and center-ups 34a<br>
to 34c previously described. Then, the procedure moves on to<br>
the subroutine in step 236. On this loading, the position of<br>
at least one of wafer table WTB and carrier arm 70 is controlled,<br>
60<br><br>
based on the position information of the inner periphery edge<br>
of opening 50a obtained in step 222 or the position information<br>
of opening 50a obtained in step 224.<br>
As is described, the second threshold value is decided<br>
for determining whether to choose tool wafer Wl or wafer W.<br>
In the case the roundness of opening 50a is high, then wafer<br>
W used in device manufacturing can be loaded without any<br>
problems on wafer holder WH inside opening 50a, however, in<br>
the case the roundness of opening 50a is low, when wafer W<br>
is to be loaded onto wafer WH inside opening 50a, the<br>
possibility is high of wafer W to come into contact with the<br>
inner periphery edge of opening 50a, and the loading may be<br>
difficult. Accordingly, in the latter case, tool wafer Wl<br>
whose diameter is smaller than wafer W is to be loaded on wafer<br>
holder WH.<br>
In the subroutine in step 236, first of all, in step 322<br>
in Fig. 14, a count value k of a third counter that shows the<br>
order of the measurement points of the outer periphery edge<br>
of the object inside opening 50a (tool wafer Wl or wafer W,<br>
hereinafter, representatively referred to as tool wafer Wl<br>
as appropriate) is initialized to 1 (k
points, K points, or in this case, eight points, which are<br>
intersecting points of eight lines that radially extend in<br>
eight directions including the horizontal and vertical<br>
directions at a center angle of 45° from the center of tool<br>
wafer Wl and the outer periphery edge of tool wafer Wl, are<br>
decided.<br>
In the next step, step 324, wafer table WTB (wafer stage<br>
WST) is moved so that the kth (in this case, the 1st) measurement<br>
61<br><br>
point on the outer periphery edge of tool wafer Wl within<br>
opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 is positioned<br>
directly under alignment system ALG, while the position of<br>
wafer table WTB is measured using interferometer system 118.<br>
In the next step, step 326, the kth (in this case, the<br>
1st) measurement point on the outer periphery edge of tool wafer<br>
Wl is picked up using alignment system ALG, and the imaging<br>
data (imaging signals) is loaded, along with the measurement<br>
values of interferometer system 118 at this point. Both data<br>
are made to correspond with each other, and are stored in memory<br>
(not shown).<br>
In the next step, step 328, the judgment is made whether<br>
or not counter value k of the third counter has reached K (in<br>
this case, K=8) or not. In this case, since k=l, the judgment<br>
here is denied, and the procedure then moves to step 330 where<br>
counter value k of the third counter is incremented by 1, and<br>
then the procedure returns to step 324.<br>
Hereinafter, the loop processing of steps 324 —&gt; 326 —&gt;<br>
328 -&gt; 330 is repeated until the judgment in step 328 is affirmed.<br>
Accordingly, as is shown in Fig. 17B, wafer table WTB is<br>
sequentially positioned to a position where each of the eight<br>
measurement points is positioned within imaging field ALG'<br>
of alignment system ALG, and the outer periphery edge of tool<br>
wafer Wl is picked up at each position-setting position using<br>
alignment system ALG, and the imaging data (imaging signals)<br>
is stored in memory with the position information (the<br>
measurement values of interferometer system 118) of wafer<br>
table WTB corresponding to the imaging data.<br>
Then, when the imaging data of the eighth point of the<br>
62<br><br>
outer periphery edge has been loaded, the judgment in step<br>
328 is affirmed, and then the procedure moves to step 332.<br>
In step 332, after the position information of the 1st<br>
to the Kth (in this case, the 8th) measurement points on the<br>
outer periphery edge of the object inside opening 50a is<br>
obtained by the image processing method, based on the imaging<br>
data (imaging results) of the K points (eight, in this case)<br>
on the outer periphery edge of the object inside opening 50a<br>
and measurement results of interferometer system 118<br>
corresponding to the imaging data that are stored in memory,<br>
the processing in the subroutine is completed, and the<br>
subroutine returns to step 240 (refer to Fig. 12) in the main<br>
routine.<br>
In step 240, the position relation between the inner<br>
periphery edge of opening 50a and the object inside opening<br>
50a is obtained. More specifically, based on the position<br>
information of the K points (in this case, eight points) on<br>
the outer periphery edge of the object in opening 50a, such<br>
as, based on the position information of the object (position<br>
information of the center of the object on the stage coordinate<br>
system (X, Y)) calculated by the least squares method or the<br>
like and the position information of opening 50a ((position<br>
information of the center of opening 50a on the stage<br>
coordinate system (X, Y)) of liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
obtained in step 224 previously described, the position<br>
relation between the inner periphery edge of opening 50a and<br>
the object within 50a, such as the information on deviation<br>
between the center of opening 50a and the center of the object<br>
(tool wafer Wl or wafer W) is obtained.<br>
63<br><br>
In the next step, step 242, wafer stage WST is moved to<br>
the wafer exchange position, and the object (tool wafer Wl<br>
or wafer W) is unloaded from wafer holder WH, using carrier<br>
arm 70 of carrier system 72 and center-ups 34a to 34c.<br>
In the next step, step 244, exposure of a lot (wafers<br>
of a predetermined number) begins.<br>
In step 244, wafer W serving as a first substrate subject<br>
to exposure on which pre-alignment (center detection and<br>
rotation adjustment) has been performed by the pre-alignment<br>
unit (not shown) constituting a part of carrier system72 is<br>
carried using carrier arm 70, to a position above wafer stage<br>
WST, located at the wafer exchange position. Then, by taking<br>
into consideration the information on position relation of<br>
the inner periphery edge of opening 50a and the object inside<br>
opening 50a obtained in step 240 described above, such as the<br>
information on deviation previously described, the position<br>
relation between carrier arm 70 and wafer stage WST is adjusted<br>
and wafer W is loaded onto wafer holder WH arranged on wafer<br>
table WTB from carrier arm 70. In this case, the adjustment<br>
of the, position relation between carrier arm 70 and wafer stage<br>
WST is performed by adjusting both or either one of the<br>
positions of carrier arm 70 and wafer stage WST. Accordingly,<br>
by loading wafer W after the position relation of carrier arm<br>
70 and wafer stage WST on loading wafer W is adjusted, normally,<br>
it becomes possible to load wafer W on wafer holder WH inside<br>
the inner periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 above wafer table WTB (inside the depressed section<br>
on the upper surface of wafer table WTB) in a manner that the<br>
outer periphery edge of wafer W and the inner periphery edge<br>
64<br><br>
(the inner periphery edge of depressed section 140 on the upper<br>
surface of wafer table WTB) of liquid-repellent plate 50a do<br>
not come into contact, and the outer periphery edge of wafer<br>
W and the inner periphery edge of opening 50a are also distanced<br>
at a predetermined value, such as, less than around 0.3mm.<br>
In the next step, step 246, wafer stage WST is moved so<br>
that it is located under alignment system ALG.<br>
In the next step, step 248, the distance between the<br>
inner periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 and (the outer periphery of) wafer W is measured across<br>
the entire circumference of wafer W in the same procedure as<br>
the position measurement of the outer periphery edge of wafer<br>
W and the like previously described, using alignment system<br>
ALG. In this case, it is especially important to arrange at<br>
least a plurality sets of measurement points that are in<br>
directions different from that of the eight directions from<br>
the wafer center on measuring the outer periphery edge or the<br>
wafer or the inner periphery edge of the opening as is<br>
previously described.<br>
Then, in the next step, step 250, the judgment of whether<br>
the distance across the entire circumference of the wafer is<br>
within a permissible range or not is made, based on the<br>
measurement results in step 248 above. As is previously<br>
described, normally, because wafer W is loaded on wafer holder<br>
WH so that the outer periphery edge of wafer W and the inner<br>
periphery edge (the inner periphery edge of depressed section<br>
140 on the upper surface of wafer table WTB) of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50a do not come into contact, and the<br>
outer periphery edge of wafer W and the inner periphery edge<br>
65<br><br>
of opening 50a are also distanced at, such as, less than around<br>
0.3mm, the judgment made in step 2 50 is affirmative, and the<br>
procedure then moves on to the next step, step 252.<br>
Meanwhile, the judgment made in step 250 based on the<br>
measurement results of step 248 may turn out to be negative,<br>
due to the outer diameter error or the like of wafer W.<br>
Accordingly, in the case the judgment in step 250 results<br>
negative, the procedure then moves to step 242 previously<br>
described, and the first wafer W is unloaded from the wafer<br>
holder. Then, the operations of steps 224, 246, 248, and 250<br>
are performed on the second wafer W as is previously described.<br>
In this case, in step 244, when the second wafer W is loaded<br>
onto the wafer stage (wafer holder), the position relation<br>
between the carrier arm and the wafer stage is adjusted taking<br>
into consideration the measurement results related to the<br>
first wafer W obtained in step 248. And, when the judgment<br>
related to the second wafer W in step 250 is affirmed, the<br>
procedure then moves to step 252.<br>
In step 252, alignment marks on wafer W are detected<br>
using alignment system ALG, and by detecting the position<br>
information of the alignment marks based on the detection<br>
results and the measurement values of interferometer system<br>
118 on detection, wafer alignment, such as Enhanced Global<br>
Alignment (EGA) , is performed.<br>
In the next step, step 254, based on the position<br>
information of a plurality of shot areas on wafer W obtained<br>
as the results of the wafer alignment referred to above, the<br>
latest baseline measurement results of alignment system ALG<br>
and the like, the movement operation in between shots in order<br>
66<br><br>
to move wafer stage WST to the scanning starting position<br>
(acceleration starting position) of each shot area and the<br>
scanning exposure operation for transferring the pattern<br>
formed on reticle R onto each shot area by the scanning exposure<br>
method are repeatedly performed, and exposure of a plurality<br>
of shot areas on wafer W by the step-and-scan method is<br>
performed. On this exposure, water is constantly supplied to<br>
the space below tip lens 91 of projection optical system PL.<br>
In the next step, step 256, the judgment of whether or<br>
not exposure of all the wafers in one lot has been completed<br>
is made. And, when the judgment turns out to be negative, the<br>
procedure then moves on to step 2 62 where wafer W held on wafer<br>
holder WH of wafer table WTB that has been exposed is exchanged<br>
with a new wafer, and then the procedure moves to step 252<br>
where the processing in the loop of steps 252 -&gt; 254 —» 256<br>
—&gt; 2 62 is hereinafter repeated until the judgment in step 256<br>
is affirmed.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case the judgment in step 256 referred<br>
to above is affirmed, the procedure then moves on to step 258.<br>
In the next step, step 258, the judgment of whether or<br>
not the timing of exchange of the liquid-repellent plate is<br>
due is made, referring to, for example, the irradiation record<br>
of illumination light IL. In the embodiment, the relation<br>
between the deterioration of the water-repellent coating on<br>
the surface of liquid-repellent plate 50 and the integrated<br>
energy amount irradiated on the surface of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 is obtained in advance by experiment, and based on<br>
the relation and the irradiation record of illumination light<br>
IL, the judgment that the timing of exchange of<br>
67<br><br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is due is to be made just before<br>
the water-repellent coating deteriorates.<br>
Then, in the case when the judgment is made that the<br>
timing of exchange is due, the procedure then moves to step<br>
2 64 previously described, and when the judgment is made that<br>
the timing has not come yet, the procedure moves on to the<br>
processing of the next lot.<br>
In the manner described above, the series of processing<br>
from exchanging the liquid-repellent plate to the next<br>
exchange is executed.<br>
As is obvious from the description so far, in the<br>
embodiment, main controller 20, or to be more precise, the<br>
CPU inside main controller 20 and the software executed by<br>
the CPU make up at least a part of each unit such as an outer<br>
periphery edge position obtaining unit, an inner periphery<br>
edge position obtaining unit, a decision-making unit, a shape<br>
calculation unit, an object outer periphery edge position<br>
obtaining unit, a distance measurement unit, a stage<br>
controller, a controller, and the like. However, it is a<br>
matter of course that at least a part of the components made<br>
up by such software may also be constituted by hardware.<br>
As is described above, according to exposure apparatus<br>
100 of the embodiment, main controller 20 detects a part of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 using alignment system ALG while<br>
measuring the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST)<br>
on which liquid-repellent plate 50 is detachably installed<br>
using interferometer system 118. And then, based on the<br>
detection results and the measurement results of<br>
interferometer system 118 corresponding to the detection<br>
68<br><br>
results, the position information of the outer periphery edge<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 is obtained (steps 204 to 210) .<br>
Therefore, it becomes possible to control the position of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50, or in other words, the position<br>
of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) on the movement coordinate<br>
system (stage coordinate system) set by the interferometer<br>
system based on the position information of the outer periphery<br>
edge of liquid-repellent plate 50, even if there are no marks<br>
for position measurement on wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST)<br>
as in the embodiment.<br>
In addition, in the case the outer periphery of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 projects outward than wafer table<br>
WTB as in the embodiment, the position of wafer table WTB wafer<br>
stage WST) can be controlled so that the outer periphery edge<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 does not touch other members (such<br>
as measurement stage MST).<br>
It is also a matter of course that the position<br>
information of the outer periphery of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 can be obtained in the manner described above, even in the<br>
case when marks for position measurement are arranged on wafer<br>
table WTB (wafer stage WST) or liquid-repellent plate 50 or<br>
when the outer periphery of liquid-repellent plate 50 does<br>
not project outward than wafer table WTB.<br>
In addition, according to exposure apparatus 100 of the<br>
embodiment, main controller 20 detects a part of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 using alignment system ALG while<br>
measuring the position of wafer table WTB using interferometer<br>
system 118. And then, based on the detection results and the<br>
measurement results of interferometer system 118<br>
69<br><br>
corresponding to the detection results, the position<br>
information of the inner periphery edge of opening 50a of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 is obtained (step 222) . Therefore,<br>
it becomes possible to calculate the position and the shape<br>
of opening 50a (refer to steps 224 and 226), based on the<br>
position information of the inner periphery edge.<br>
In addition, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
in the case, for example, when the roundness is below the second<br>
threshold value, main controller 20 loads wafer W on wafer<br>
holder WH (step 232) inside opening 50a of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 on wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) via carrier system<br>
72, based on the position information of the inner periphery<br>
edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 . Accordingly,<br>
it becomes easier to load wafer W inside opening 50a of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 on wafer stage WST than when the<br>
information related to the inner periphery edge of opening<br>
50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 is not take into<br>
consideration.<br>
In addition, in exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
in the case the position relation between the inner periphery<br>
edge of opening 50a and the object inside opening 50a (tool<br>
wafer Wl or wafer W) is obtained (refer to step 240), main<br>
controller 20 loads the wafer adjusting the position relation<br>
of carrier arm 70 and the wafer table by controlling at least<br>
either wafer table WTB or carrier arm 70 of carrier system<br>
72 taking into consideration the position relation referred<br>
to above, when carrying wafer W to wafer table WTB by carrier<br>
system 72 (refer to step 244). Accordingly, based on the<br>
position relation that has been obtained, it becomes possible<br>
70<br><br>
to load the wafer within the depressed section 140 of wafer<br>
table WTB, that is, within the inner periphery edge of opening<br>
50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 at a desired position relation.<br>
In this case, it becomes possible to load wafer W on wafer<br>
holder WH within the inner periphery edge (within the depressed<br>
section on the upper surface of wafer table WTB) of opening<br>
50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 above wafer table WTB, so<br>
that the outer periphery edge of wafer W and the inner periphery<br>
edge (the inner periphery edge of the depressed section on<br>
the upper surface of wafer table WTB) of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50a do not come into contact, and the outer periphery edge<br>
of wafer W and the inner periphery edge of opening 50a are<br>
also distanced at a predetermined value, such as, less than<br>
around 0.3mm.<br>
In the operations described referring to Figs. 11 and<br>
12, when tool wafer Wl is mounted on the wafer holder, the<br>
first threshold value and the second threshold value are set<br>
with respect to the shape (roundness) of opening 50a. However,<br>
the judgment of whether to mount tool wafer Wl on the wafer<br>
holder or not can be made using only one of the threshold values.<br>
In this case, tool wafer Wl can be a wafer with a smaller<br>
diameter than that of wafer W subject to exposure, or a wafer<br>
that has substantially the same diameter as wafer W subject<br>
to exposure.<br>
In addition, in the operations described referring to<br>
Figs. 11 and 12, tool wafer Wl is mounted on the wafer holder<br>
after the shape information of opening 50a is obtained, however,<br>
such a process of obtaining shape information can be omitted.<br>
In this case as well, a wafer with a smaller diameter than<br>
71<br><br>
that of wafer W subject to exposure or a wafer that has<br>
substantially the same diameter as wafer W subject to exposure<br>
can be used as tool wafer Wl.<br>
In addition, in the operations described referring to<br>
Figs. 11 and 12, tool wafer Wl is mounted on the wafer holder<br>
after the position information and the shape information of<br>
opening 50a are obtained, however, obtaining the position<br>
information and the shape information of opening 50a can be<br>
omitted, and the position information of the opening and the<br>
position relation (including the distance) of the inner<br>
periphery edge of the opening and the outer periphery edge<br>
of tool wafer Wl can be obtained, after tool wafer Wl is mounted<br>
on the wafer holder. As a matter of course, the shape<br>
information of opening 50a can be obtained if necessary.  In<br>
this case, as tool wafer Wl, it is desirable for the wafer<br>
to be a wafer whose diameter is smaller than that of wafer<br>
W subject to exposure, however, the wafer may be a wafer of<br>
substantially the same diameter as wafer W subj ect to exposure .<br>
In addition, in the operations described referring to<br>
Figs. 11 and 12, the position relation (distance) between the<br>
inner periphery edge of opening 50a and wafer W is measured<br>
when wafer W serving as a first substrate subject to exposure<br>
is mounted on the wafer holder. However, in the case wafer<br>
W serving as the substrate subject to exposure can be loaded<br>
onto the predetermined position within opening 50a, the<br>
measurement operation (steps 246, 248, and 250) can be omitted.<br>
In addition, in the operations described referring to<br>
Figs. 11 and 12, in step 258, the judgment is made whether<br>
or not to exchange liguid-repellent plate 50 after the exposure<br>
72<br><br>
processing of one lot has been completed. Step 258, however,<br>
may be omitted, and the judgment can be made at a predetermined<br>
time interval, or the liquid-repellent plate may be exchanged<br>
after the elapse of a predetermined period, without making<br>
any judgment of whether or not the exchange is necessary.<br>
And, according to exposure apparatus 100, exposure of<br>
wafer W mounted within the inner periphery edge (within the<br>
depressed section on the upper surface of wafer table WTB)<br>
of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 above wafer table<br>
WTB as is described above is performed (step 254), by<br>
irradiating illumination light IL on wafer W. Accordingly,<br>
leakage of liquid (water) Lq from the space between wafer W<br>
and liquid-repellent plate 50 can be suppressed during<br>
exposure, and by the immersion exposure, since exposure is<br>
performed with high resolution and a greater depth of focus<br>
compared with when exposure is performed in the air, the<br>
pattern of reticle R can be transferred with good precision<br>
on the wafer, and for example, with an ArF excimer laser beam,<br>
a fine pattern that has a device rule of around 45 to 100 nm<br>
can be transferred.<br>
According to exposure apparatus 100 of the embodiment,<br>
since only minimum component members required for exposing<br>
the wafer, such as the wafer holder, need to be arranged on<br>
wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) , the size and weight of wafer<br>
stage WST can be reduced, which makes it possible to reduce<br>
the size of the drive mechanism (motors) that drive the wafer<br>
stage as well as reduce the heat generated from the motors,<br>
which in turn can suppress the thermal deformation of wafer<br>
stage WST and degradation of exposure to the utmost.<br>
73<br><br>
In the embodiment above, the case has been described<br>
where a plurality of measurement points is set on the outer<br>
periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 and the position<br>
information is obtained for the measurement points. The<br>
present invention, however, is not limited to this, and for<br>
example, at a position on the inner side of the outer periphery<br>
edge position on the upper surface of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50, a mark whose position relation with the outer periphery<br>
edge is known, such as a line-shaped mark parallel to the outer<br>
periphery edge at a position a predetermined distance<br>
(referred to as D) away from the outer periphery edge, can<br>
be formed. And, at least one measurement point can be set on<br>
the mark and the position information measured, and the<br>
position of the outer periphery edge can be obtained based<br>
on the measurement results and distance D described above.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 18, on liquid-repellent plate 50 in the<br>
vicinity of the edge, there are many cases where there is a<br>
curved surface (or an oblique surface) of a width d and height<br>
h, and because height h is approximately 0.1 mm, the image<br>
of the edge may be blurred in the case the depth of focus of<br>
alignment system ALG is shallow. In such a case, the<br>
line-shaped mark referred to above can be set at a position<br>
where D is greater than d (D&gt;d) , and the line-shaped mark can<br>
be imaged by alignment system ALG. As a matter of course, the<br>
mark is not limited to the line-shaped mark described above,<br>
and the mark may be of any shape, as long as the position<br>
relation with the outer edge periphery is known.<br>
Similarly, for the inner periphery edge of opening 50a<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50, a mark whose position relation<br>
74<br><br>
with the inner periphery edge is known can be formed in advance,<br>
and the position information of at least one measurement point<br>
on the mark may be obtained.  For example, a line of a circle<br>
concentric with opening 50a may be formed a predetermined<br>
distance outside the inner periphery edge of opening 50a.<br>
In addition, on detecting the position information such<br>
as the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50, it<br>
is desirable to use a focal point detection system that<br>
alignment system ALG has.  In the case, however, when the<br>
detection beam of the focal point detection system of alignment<br>
system ALG moves away from liquid-repellent plate 50, it is<br>
desirable to perform the so-called shift focus operation where<br>
the position of the measurement points is set within the<br>
imaging field of alignment system ALG after focus alignment<br>
is performed once at a position where the detection beam can<br>
be irradiated on the surface of liquid-repellent plate 50.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the position information of each measurement<br>
point is obtained by the image processing method using the<br>
imaging results of the image of the outer periphery of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50, the inner periphery edge of opening<br>
50a, or the outer periphery edge of tool wafer Wl or wafer<br>
W picked up using alignment system ALG consisting of a sensor<br>
by the FIA system. However, as the detection unit, sensors<br>
other than the FIA system, such as a unit that detects<br>
reflection light or scattered light may also be used.  Further,<br>
in the case of using the FIA system, the method of detecting<br>
the reflected light from the object by downward illumination<br>
may naturally be used, however, it is also possible to<br>
75<br><br>
illuminate the edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 from below<br>
and detect the transmitted light above liquid-repellent plate<br>
50.<br>
In the embodiment descried above, at least one of the<br>
exchange operation of liquid-repellent plate 50 and the<br>
various measurements of liquid-repellent plate 50 may be<br>
performed in a state without liquid Lq on the image plane side<br>
of projection optical system PL, or the operation may be<br>
performed in a state with liquid Lq held in the space between<br>
measurement table MTB and projection optical system PL.  In<br>
the case of keeping liquid Lq held in the space between<br>
measurement table MTB and projection optical system PL,<br>
because the tip surface of projection optical system PL can<br>
be maintained in a wet state, not only can water marks or the<br>
like be kept from being generated but also the operation of<br>
total recovery and re-supply of liquid Lq can be omitted.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment described above, the case<br>
has been described where wafer table WTB constitutes the first<br>
stage (and a moving body) on which the plate whose position<br>
information of the outer periphery edge is detected is<br>
detachably mounted, and measurement stage MST constitutes the<br>
second stage. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to this, and measurement table MTB may constitute the first<br>
stage (and the moving body) . That is, the position<br>
information of the outer periphery edge of a plate detachably<br>
mounted on measurement table MTB may be obtained.  In this case,<br>
the movement of measurement table MTB can be controlled based<br>
on the position information of the outer periphery edge.  In<br>
this case, at least one of the plate exchange operation of<br>
76<br><br>
measurement table MTB and the various measurements of the plate<br>
may be performed in a state without liquid Lq on the image<br>
plane side of projection optical system PL, or the operation<br>
may be performed in a state with liquid Lq held in the space<br>
between wafer table WTB and projection optical system PL.<br>
The exchange operation of liquid-repellent plate 50 of<br>
wafer table WTB or the measurement operation of the outer<br>
periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 and the inner<br>
periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50<br>
may be performed in a state where liquid Lq is held in the<br>
space between measurement table MTB and projection optical<br>
system PL.<br>
More specifically, when liquid-repellent plate 50 is<br>
exchanged on the side of wafer table WTB, the position of<br>
measurement table MTB is controlled so that liquid Lq is<br>
positioned above measurement table MTB, as is shown in Fig.<br>
19A. Then after the exchange of liquid-repellent plate 50 has<br>
bee completed, the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 on the side (the +Y side) of measurement table MTB<br>
(measurement stage MST) is measured, using alignment system<br>
ALG, as is shown in Fig. 19B. With this operation, it becomes<br>
possible to move wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) closer to<br>
measurement table MTB (measurement stage MST).<br>
Next, the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 on the -X side and the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 on the +X side are sequentially<br>
measured using alignment system ALG, as is shown in Figs. 19C<br>
and 19D.<br>
Then, based on the position information of the three<br>
77<br><br>
points on the outer periphery edge of liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 obtained in the manner described above or the position<br>
information of liquid-repellent plate 50 obtained from the<br>
position information above, main controller 20 subsequently<br>
performs position control of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) .<br>
After the position information of the outer periphery<br>
edge of liquid-repellent plate 50 is measured as is described<br>
above, for example, wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST<br>
are integrally moved while maintaining a state where<br>
(liquid-repellent plate 50 of) wafer table WTB and measurement<br>
table MTB come into contact with (or are close to) each other,<br>
and the inner periphery edge of opening 50a of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50 on the +Y side is measured using alignment system<br>
ALG, as is shown in Fig. 20A. Next, both stages WST and MST<br>
are sequentially moved integrally, while maintaining the<br>
state where (liquid-repellent plate 50 of) wafer table WTB<br>
and measurement table MTB come into contact with (or are close<br>
to) each other, and the inner periphery edge of opening 50a<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 on the -X side and the inner<br>
periphery edge on the +X side are sequentially measured using<br>
alignment system ALG, as is shown in Figs. 20B and 20C.  In<br>
this case, since there is no wafer mounted on wafer table WTB,<br>
liquid Lq cannot be positioned at the point where the wafer<br>
is mounted, however, because the inner periphery edge can be<br>
measured as is shown in Figs. 20A to 20C, it is possible to<br>
load wafer on wafer holder WH in a manner similar to the<br>
embodiment above based on the measurement results.<br>
As is described above, by performing the exchange<br>
operation of liquid-repellent plate 50 of wafer table WTB and<br>
78<br><br>
the measurement operation of the outer periphery edge of<br>
liquid-repellent plate 50 or the inner periphery edge of<br>
opening 50a of liquid-repellent plate 50 in a state with liquid<br>
Lq held in the space between measurement table MTB and<br>
projection optical system PL, the recovery operation and the<br>
supply operation of the liquid will not be necessary, which<br>
means that the time required for the operations can be cut,<br>
which in turn makes it possible to increase the throughput<br>
in the exposure process.<br>
As is described above, after the outer periphery edge<br>
of liquid-repellent plate 50 and the inner periphery edge of<br>
opening 50a are measured and the wafer is loaded on wafer holder<br>
WH, the movement range in a state where liquid-repellent plate<br>
50 of wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) on which the wafer<br>
is loaded and measurement table MTB come into contact with<br>
each other broadens . That is, it becomes possible to position<br>
liquid Lq on the entire surface of wafer table WTB.<br>
Accordingly, measurement using the measurement method<br>
according to the flowcharts in Figs. 7, 11, and 12 described<br>
in the above embodiment may be performed again. Such an<br>
arrangement makes it possible to perform measurement with high<br>
precision.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the measurement points for position<br>
information are set at a plurality of areas symmetry to the<br>
center for each of the outer periphery of liquid-repellent<br>
plate 50, the inner periphery of opening 50a, and the outer<br>
periphery edge of tool wafer Wl or wafer W. Such an arrangement<br>
was employed, however, merely because an improvement in the<br>
79<br><br>
measurement accuracy could be expected by the averaging effect<br>
when calculating the position of each center point, and it<br>
is a matter of course that the present invention is not limited<br>
to this.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the shape of liquid-repellent plate 50 is<br>
substantially a square and opening 50a is a circle. The shape<br>
of the plate, however, may be a circle, a polygon, or any other<br>
shape, and the opening also may be of any shape as long as<br>
the shape corresponds to the object subject to processing.<br>
For example, in the case a liquid crystal display device is<br>
the object subject to processing, the shape of the opening<br>
can be a square according to the shape of the glass plate,<br>
serving as the object subject to processing.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where plate 50 is detachable to wafer table WTB,<br>
however, plate 50 may be formed integral with wafer table WTB.<br>
In this case as well, the position information of the inner<br>
periphery edge of the depressed section formed in order to<br>
mount wafer W on wafer table WTB can be detected, as is shown<br>
in Figs. 11 and 13.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the series of<br>
operations including measuring the position information of<br>
the outer periphery edge of the plate described using Fig.<br>
7 and the series of operations including measuring the position<br>
information of the inner periphery edge of the opening of the<br>
plate described using Fig. 11 do not necessarily have to be<br>
performed together, and performing only one of the series of<br>
operations is acceptable.<br>
80<br><br>
In the embodiment above, the case has been described<br>
where the present invention is applied to a liquid immersion<br>
exposure apparatus, however, the scope of the present<br>
invention is not limited to this, and the present invention<br>
can be suitably applied to a typical scanning stepper which<br>
is not of the immersion type. In this case, instead of the<br>
liquid-repellent plate, a plate that does not have a<br>
liquid-repellent surface formed can be used.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the stage unit is equipped with a wafer stage<br>
and a measurement stage. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this, and the stage unit may be equipped with<br>
at least one wafer stage for holding the wafer, without being<br>
equipped with the measurement stage. In the case the stage<br>
unit is equipped with a plurality of wafer stages, at least<br>
one of the plate exchange operation and the various measurement<br>
operations on one of the stages may be performed in a state<br>
without liquid Lq on the image plane side of projection optical<br>
system PL, or the operation may be performed in a state where<br>
the other stage is arranged below projection optical system<br>
PL (on the image plane side) and liquid Lq is held in the space<br>
between the projection optical system and the other wafer<br>
stage.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the arrangement of leveling table 52 having<br>
six degrees of freedom and measurement table MTB having three<br>
degrees of freedom are employed. The present invention,<br>
however, is not limited to this, and the arrangement of<br>
leveling table 52 having three degrees of freedom and<br>
81<br><br>
measurement table MTB having three degrees of freedom may also<br>
be employed. Further, the arrangement of measurement table<br>
MTB having six degrees of freedom, without arranging leveling<br>
table 52, may also be employed.<br>
In the embodiment above, pure water (water) is used as<br>
the liquid, however, as a matter of course, the present<br>
invention is not limited to this. As the liquid, a liquid that<br>
is chemically stable, having high transmittance to<br>
illumination light IL and safe to use, such as a fluorine<br>
containing inert liquid may be used. As such as a<br>
fluorine-containing inert liquid, for example, Fluorinert<br>
(the brand name of 3M United States) can be used. The<br>
fluorine-containing inert liquid is also excellent from the<br>
point of cooling effect.  In addition, as the liquid, a liquid<br>
which has high transmittance to illumination light IL and a<br>
refractive index as high as possible, and furthermore, a liquid<br>
which is stable against the projection optical system and the<br>
photoresist coated on the surface of the wafer (for example,<br>
cederwood oil or the like) can also be used. Further, in the<br>
case the F2 laser is used as the light source, fomblin oil may<br>
be chosen.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the liquid that<br>
has been recovered may be reused. In this case, it is desirable<br>
to arrange a filter for removing impurities from the liquid<br>
that has been recovered in the liquid recovery unit, in the<br>
recovery pipes, or the like.<br>
In the embodiment above, the optical element of<br>
projection optical system PL closest to the image plane side<br>
is tip lens 91. The optical element, however, is not limited<br>
82<br><br>
to lenses, and it may be an optical plate (parallel plane plate)<br>
used for adjusting the optical properties of projection<br>
optical system PL such as aberration (such as spherical<br>
aberration, coma, or the like) , it may simply be a cover glass.<br>
The surface of the optical element of projection optical system<br>
PL closest to the image plane side (tip lens 91 in the<br>
embodiment above) may be smudged by coming into contact with<br>
the liquid (water, in the embodiment above) due to scattered<br>
particles generated from the resist by the irradiation of<br>
illumination light IL or adherence of impurities in the liquid.<br>
Therefore, the optical element is to be fixed freely detachable<br>
(exchangeable) in the lowest section of barrel 40, and may<br>
be exchanged periodically.<br>
In such a case, when the optical element that comes into<br>
contact with the liquid is a lens, the cost for replacement<br>
parts is high, and the time required for exchange becomes long,<br>
which leads to an increase in the maintenance cost (running<br>
cost) as well as a decrease in throughput. Therefore, the<br>
optical element that comes into contact with the liquid may<br>
be, for example, a parallel plane plate, which is less costly<br>
than lens 91.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described where the present invention is applied to a scanning<br>
exposure apparatus by the step-and-scan method or the like.<br>
It is a matter of course, that the present invention is not<br>
limited to this, and more specifically, the present invention<br>
can also be applied to a projection exposure apparatus by the<br>
step-and-repeat method, an exposure apparatus by the<br>
step-and-stitch method, an exposure apparatus by the<br>
83<br><br>
proximity method, and the like.<br>
As the usage of the exposure apparatus, it is not limited<br>
to exposure apparatus for manufacturing semiconductor devices,<br>
and for example, the present invention can be widely applied<br>
to an exposure apparatus for manufacturing liquid crystal<br>
displays which transfers a liquid crystal display deice<br>
pattern onto a square shaped glass plate, and to an exposure<br>
apparatus for manufacturing organic EL, thin-film magnetic<br>
heads, imaging devices (such as CCDs), micromachines, DNA<br>
chips, and the like.  In addition, the present invention can<br>
also be suitably applied to an exposure apparatus that<br>
transfers a circuit pattern onto a glass substrate or a silicon<br>
wafer not only when producing microdevices such as<br>
semiconductors, but also when producing a reticle or a mask<br>
used in exposure apparatus such as an optical exposure<br>
apparatus, an EUV exposure apparatus, an X-ray exposure<br>
apparatus, or an electron beam exposure apparatus.<br>
The light source of the exposure apparatus in the<br>
embodiment above is not limited to the ArF excimer laser, and<br>
a pulsed laser light source such as a KrF excimer laser (output<br>
wavelength 248 nm) , an F2 laser (output wavelength 157 nm),<br>
an Ar2 laser (output wavelength 126 nm) , and Kr2 laser (output<br>
wavelength 14 6 nm), or the like, or an ultra high-pressure<br>
mercury lamp that generates a bright line such as the g-line<br>
(wavelength 436 nm) or the i-line (wavelength 365 nm) can also<br>
be used. In addition, a harmonic generating unit or the like<br>
of a YAG laser can also be used. In addition, a harmonic wave<br>
may also be used that is obtained by amplifying a<br>
single-wavelength laser beam in the infrared or visible range<br>
84<br><br>
emitted by a DFB semiconductor laser or fiber laser, with a<br>
fiber amplifier doped with, for example, erbium (or both erbium<br>
and ytteribium), and by converting the wavelength into<br>
ultraviolet light using a nonlinear optical crystal.  Further,<br>
the projection optical system is not limited to a reduction<br>
system, and the system may be either an equal magnifying system<br>
or a magnifying system.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment above, the case has been<br>
described of an exposure apparatus that uses a mask (reticle)<br>
of the light transmitting type, which is a substrate of the<br>
light transmitting type where a predetermined light-shielding<br>
pattern (or a phase pattern or an extinction pattern) is formed.<br>
However, the present invention can also be applied to an<br>
exposure apparatus that uses an electronic mask (a variable<br>
shaped mask) which forms a transmittance pattern, a reflection<br>
pattern, or an emission pattern, based on the electronic data<br>
of the pattern that is to be exposed as is disclosed in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 6,778,257, instead of the reticle<br>
above.<br>
In addition, as is disclosed in the pamphlet of<br>
International Publication No. WO2001/035168, by forming<br>
interference fringes on wafer W, the present invention can<br>
also be applied to an exposure apparatus (a lithography system)<br>
that forms line-and-space patterns on wafer W.<br>
In the embodiment above, the case has been described<br>
where the position measurement method, the measurement method,<br>
and the loading method of the present invention are applied<br>
to an exposure apparatus. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this, and the position measurement method of<br>
85<br><br>
the present invention can be applied to a unit as long as the<br>
unit is equipped with a moving body on which a plate of a<br>
predetermined shape is detachably mounted, and the<br>
measurement method and the loading method of the present<br>
invention can be applied to a unit as long as the unit is<br>
equipped with a moving body on which a plate that has an opening<br>
formed for placing an object is detachably mounted.<br>
Semiconductor devices are manufactured through the<br>
following steps: a step where the function/performance design<br>
of a device is performed; a step where a reticle based on the<br>
design step is manufactured; a step where a wafer is<br>
manufactured using materials such as silicon; a lithography<br>
step where the pattern formed on the mask is transferred onto<br>
a photosensitive object by the exposure apparatus described<br>
in the embodiment above; a device assembly step (including<br>
processes such as dicing process, bonding process, and<br>
packaging process); inspection step, and the like.  In this<br>
case, in the lithography step, because the exposure apparatus<br>
and the exposure method in the embodiment above are used,<br>
exposure with high precision can be achieved for over a long<br>
period of time. Accordingly, the productivity of<br>
high-integration microdevices on which fine patterns are<br>
formed can be improved.<br>
