DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a heat exchange cooler used for, for<br>
example, cooling equipment in a box which stores heat generating<br>
equipment such as a cellular phone base station, and a power circuit driving<br>
device used for the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, this type of heat exchange cooler includes an<br>
internal air passage for sucking the internal air of a heat generating<br>
element storing box, passing the sucked air through a heat exchanging<br>
element for the purpose of heat exchange, and again, returning the air into<br>
the heat generating element storing box, thereby circulating the air. The<br>
heat exchange cooler also includes an outside air passage for collecting the<br>
outside air, passing the collected air through a heat exchanging element for<br>
the purpose of heat exchange, and again, discharging the air outside.<br>
These air passages are separated by a partition plate and independent of<br>
each other, and each of the air passages internally includes a fan for<br>
transferring the air. This type of cooler is commonly known (for example,<br>
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-156478).<br>
Generally, a heat exchange cooler having such a configuration is<br><br><br>
used for cooling a cellular phone base station or the like, and low voltage DC<br>
power converted from commercial power is supplied from main body side of<br>
the cellular phone base station to the heat exchange cooler for the purpose of<br>
driving a fan or the like mounted with a DC motor.<br>
	The operation of conventional heat exchange cooler 100 will be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 17. As shown in Fig. 17, the air heated in<br>
heat generating element storing box 101 (hereinafter called inside air) is<br>
sucked from inside air suction port 102 of heat exchange cooler 100 by<br>
means of indoor fan 104 mounted with indoor DC brushless motor 103, and<br>
 passed through heat exchanging element 105, and again returned into heat<br>
generating element storing box 101 from internal air discharge port 106,<br>
thereby forming a circulation passage.<br>
On the other hand, the outside air sucked from outside air suction<br>
port 109 by means of outdoor fan 108 mounted with outdoor DC brushless<br>
 motor 107 is passed through heat exchanging element 105, and again<br>
discharged outside from outside air discharge port 110. The inside air<br>
passage and the outside air passage are separated from each other by<br>
partition plate 111 in a state of being generally air-tight so as to be<br>
independent of each other, and at the intersection of the inside air passage<br>
 and the outside air passage is disposed heat exchanging element 105 for<br>
exchanging sensible heat of the outside air and inside air. Heat exchange<br>
cooler 100 collects the low-temperature outside air, and performs heat<br>
exchange with the hot air in heat generating element storing box 101 by<br>
means of heat exchanging element 105, thereby discharging the warmed<br>
 outside air and feeding the cooled air into heat generating element storing<br><br>
box 101.<br>
Also, indoor DC brushless motor 103 and outdoor DC brushless<br>
motor 107 are usually equipped with a pole sensor such as a Hall element.<br>
Electronic control unit 112 as a controller for driving and controlling these<br>
indoor DC brushless motor 103 and outdoor DC brushless motor 107 is<br>
installed in the inside air passage of heat exchange cooler 100 to as to be<br>
free from the influence of lowtemperature outside air or dust in a place<br>
where the base station is installed, and is connected to outdoor DC<br>
brushless motor 107 exposed to the outside air by using long relay power<br>
lead 114 and sensor signal lead 115. Driving power is supplied to<br>
electronic control unit 112 as a controller from relatively low voltage DC<br>
power 116 (see Fig. 20) installed in heat generating element storing box 101<br>
or the like.<br>
In such a conventional configuration, when heating in heat<br>
generating element storing box 101 is less and the outside air temperature<br>
is low, a heat exchange rate due to heat exchanging element 105 lowers, so<br>
that outdoor DC brushless motor 107 disposed at the outside air passage is<br>
often exposed to the low-temperature outside air. Accordingly, when a<br>
magnetic sensor such as a Hall element is installed in DC brushless motor<br>
107, it is necessary to install heat exchange cooler 100, for example, in a<br>
place where the ambient temperature is higher than - 30 oC so that the<br>
magnetic sensor is reliably operated. Also, since outdoor DC brushless<br>
motor 107 and electronic control unit 112 as a controller disposed at the<br>
inside air passage side are connected to each other with a long relay lead,<br>
there exists a fear of faulty operation of signal lead 115 for sensor signal as<br><br>
it is affected by noise. Also, the internal wiring of heat exchange cooler 100<br>
is complicated taking much time for the work, and a problem of high costs<br>
for heat exchange cooler 100 arises.<br>
A power circuit driving device used for heat exchange cooler 100 will<br>
be described in the following. Conventionally, a power circuit driving<br>
device using switching power based on a high-frequency switching system is<br>
commonly known as a power circuit driving device of this type. It is<br>
described with reference to Fig. 18, Fig. 19 and Fig. 20.<br>
Fig. 18 shows heat generating element storing box 101, and heat<br>
exchange cooler 100 for cooling heat generating element storing box 101.<br>
Also, Fig. 19 shows heat exchange cooler 100, heat exchanger 105 as a heat<br>
exchanging means for discharging the inside air heat into the open air,<br>
electronic control unit 112 as a controller mounted with a microcomputer,<br>
and DC fan motor 119 driven and controlled by electronic control unit 112.<br>
Also, inside air passage flow N19 and outside air passage flow G19 are<br>
shown in the figure.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 20, DC power 116 supplied from heat<br>
generating element storing box 101 (see Fig. 17, Fig. 18) is the voltage<br>
source of heat exchange cooler 100, and DC voltage is also supplied to<br>
electronic control unit 112 and DC fan motor 119. Also, heat exchange<br>
cooler 100 is supplied with AC voltage from commercial AC power source<br>
122 as auxiliary power supplied from heat generating element storing box<br>
101. The supplied AC voltage is connected to switching power source<br>
(AC/DC) 124 based on a high-frequency switching system for converting AC<br>
voltage to DC voltage via noise filter (N/F) 123. Specified DC voltage<br><br>
converted to DC voltage is collected from the output side of switching power<br>
source (AC/DC) 124, and the collected DC voltage is supplied to electronic<br>
control unit 112 and DC fan motor 119.<br>
In the above configuration, as to DC power 116 as main power<br>
usually supplied, for example, even when DC power 116 is not supplied as a<br>
result of activation of DC power breaker (not shown) of heat generating<br>
element storing box 101, power will be continuously supplied from<br>
commercial power source 122. In this way, DC fan motor 119 is driven<br>
according to the instruction of electronic control unit 112 with the<br>
predetermined DC voltage converted by switching power source (AC/DC)<br>
124. Thus, the outside air and the inside air are circulated, discharging the<br>
inside air heat into the outside air, in order to cool heat generating element<br>
storing box 101.<br>
Also, as a power circuit driving device used for a heat exchange<br>
cooler of this type, commonly known is the one provided with a selector<br>
switch and a plurality of taps at the primary side of a commercial power<br>
transformer in order to cope with so-called 200V type commercial power,<br>
ranging from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage used in many countries and<br>
districts in the world.<br>
The power circuit driving device used for the heat exchange cooler is<br>
described in the following with reference to Fig. 21. As shown in Fig. 21,<br>
commercial power source 122 as auxiliary power supplied to heat exchange<br>
cooler 100 from heat generating element storing box 101 is connected with<br>
select switch 120 for switching to nominal voltage (generally 200V, 208V,<br>
220V, 230V, 240V, 250V). Select switch 120 is provided with, for example,<br><br>
six taps in order to cope with the levels of nominal voltages disposed at the<br>
primary side of commercial power source 121. DC voltage rectified and<br>
smoothed by the first diode bridge 117 and the first capacitor 118 is<br>
generated at the secondary side output of commercial power source 121.<br>
The DC voltage is supplied to electronic control unit 104 and DC fan motor<br>
119.<br>
In this configuration, in the installation of heat exchange cooler 100<br>
is installed, when the knob of select switch 120 is turned to make the<br>
adjustment to the level of nominal voltage of commercial AC power source<br>
122, the contact of select switch 120 is manually connected to a tap suited<br>
for the rated voltage of commercial power source 122 of commercial power<br>
transformer 121, thereby making a predetermined DC voltage. Here, even<br>
when no DC voltage is supplied, for example, because of activation of a<br>
breaker (not shown) of heat generating element storing box 101, DC power<br>
source 116 usually supplied as main power is supplied from commercial<br>
power source 122. Accordingly, DC fan motor 119 can be operated<br>
according to the instruction of electronic control unit 112 with<br>
predetermined DC voltage VI. Thus, the outside air and the inside air are<br>
circulated, the inside air heat is discharged into the outside air, and thereby,<br>
heat generating element storing box 101 is cooled (see Fig. 17, Fig. 18).<br>
In the case of a power circuit driving device for a conventional heat<br>
exchange cooler using such a switching power source based on a<br>
high-frequency switching system, a problem that high frequency electric<br>
waves of noise are continuously radiated during the switching operation<br>
arises. In a heat generating element storing box for communication<br><br>
equipment, continuously radiated high frequency electric waves of noise<br>
must be reduced to such a level that the communication is not affected.<br>
For example, in 800MHz band of cellular phone communication frequency,<br>
according to the limit value of interference waves of technical information<br>
equipment, CISPR (International Special Committee on Radio Interference)<br>
22, there is a fear of trouble with the equipment when the level exceeds<br>
37dB U V/m in a 10m method, and it is required to be greatly lower than the<br>
level.<br>
Also, in a type compatible with multiple power sources, the input<br>
voltage of switching power source is generally in a range form 90V to 264V.<br>
Taking into account ± 10% of voltage variation of 200V type commercial<br>
power whose nominal voltage ranges from 200V to 250V, it is required to<br>
cover a range of 180V to 275V.<br>
Also, in a power circuit driving device used for a conventional heat<br>
exchange cooler using a select switch for switching a plurality of taps at the<br>
primary side of the commercial power transformer, it is necessary to<br>
manipulate the select switch in accordance with the nominal voltage of<br>
commercial AC power supplied by the person in charge of installation<br>
during the installation work, and a problem of increase in man hour for the<br>
installation work arises. Consequently, it is required to reduce the man<br>
hour for the work.<br>
Also, when a power circuit driving device is installed in a heat<br>
exchange cooler, a problem of wrong setting of the select switch, and it is<br>
desired to prevent occurrence of human errors arises.<br>
Also, in case a commercial AC power is supplied, for example,<br><br>
exceeding the range of + 10% of nominal voltage due to a trouble with the<br>
distribution equipment or the like, a problem that the DC voltage output exceeds<br>
the specified range in case of fixed tap connection arises. Accordingly, it is<br>
required not to exceed the specified DC voltage even in case the commercial AC<br>
power exceeds the range of + 10% of nominal voltage due to a trouble with the<br>
distribution equipment or the like.<br>
EP 1 085 272 A describes a heating-element accommodating-box cooling<br>
apparatus which includes: an indoor air passage for fetching air in a heating-<br>
element accommodating box and returning it to the heating-element<br>
accommodating box; an outdoor air passage for fetching outdoor air and<br>
exhausting the fetched outdoor air to the outside; a partition plate provided so<br>
that both of the air passages become independent of each other; a fan unit for<br>
conveying air in the outdoor air passage and the indoor air passage; and a heat<br>
exchange element disposed at a point of intersection between the two passages<br>
to exchange the sensible heat of the outdoor air and the indoor air; wherein the<br>
heating-element accommodating-box cooling apparatus is mounted exteriorly on<br>
a panel of the heating-element accommodating box. Consequently, it is possible<br>
to effect cooling of the heating-element accommodating box with energy saving,<br>
and the space for installation of the cooing apparatus in the box is not required.<br>
EP 1473 823 A describes a motor driving apparatus which comprises an inverter<br>
circuit for converting an output voltage of a power supply into a three-phase AC<br>
and outputting the same to the brushless motor; a rotor position estimation unit<br>
for estimating a rotor position of the brushless motor; and an inverter control<br><br>
unit for controlling the inverter circuit so that the brushless motor is driven by a<br>
current based on the estimated rotor position. The inverter control unit<br>
determines an advance angle of the current supplied to the brushless motor with<br>
respect to the estimated rotor so as to minimize a deviation between a command<br>
rpm and an actual rpm. Therefore, it is possible to perform stable weak field<br>
control for the brushless motor, independently from the input voltage of the<br>
inverter circuit, without using predetermined control variables such as table<br>
values.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The heat exchange cooler of the present invention is intended to solve such a<br>
conventional problem, and an object is to realize the reliability improvement and<br>
cost reduction of the heat exchange cooler, eliminating the influences of<br>
temperature conditions in the place of installation, by using a sensor-less type<br>
DC brushless motor as an outdoor DC brushless motor. Also, a low-cost heat<br>
exchange cooler by reducing the man hour for the installation work is provided.<br>
Also, the power circuit driving device used for the heat exchange cooler of the<br>
present invention automatically performs the switching pf a plurality of taps<br>
installed in the power transformer, thereby reducing the man hour for the<br>
installation work, improving the reliability, and reducing the cost.<br>
The heat exchange cooler of the present invention employs a sensor-less DC<br>
brushless motor as an outdoor DC brushless motor for driving the outdoor fan.<br>
Since no magnetic sensor such as a Hall element which is a electronic part in the<br>
motor is included in the structure, it is possible to install the outdoor DC<br>
brushless motor in the low-temperature 	<br><br>
outside air and to eliminate the influences of temperature conditions in the<br>
place of installation.<br>
Further, since it is not necessary to use the relay lead for sensor<br>
signal used for connection with the controller disposed at the inside air<br>
passage side, it is possible to provide a highly reliable heat exchange cooler<br>
capable of eliminating the problem of intrusion of noise into the sensor<br>
signal line and faulty operation. In addition, because no lead wire is<br>
needed, it is not necessary to carry out the work for relay lead connection.<br>
As a result, the man hour for the installation work can be reduced, so that it<br>
is possible to provide a low-cost heat exchange cooler.<br>
Still further, the heat exchange cooler of the present invention<br>
employs a sensor-less DC brushless motor as the indoor side motor similar<br>
to that for the outside. As a result, the driving devices of sensor-less DC<br>
brushless motors at the outdoor side and indoor side can be controlled in the<br>
same method, so that it is possible to obtain a low-cost heat exchange cooler.<br>
Yet further, the heat exchange cooler of the present invention<br>
detects the current flowing in the inverter circuit, thereby configuring a<br>
position detecting section for the sensor-less DC brushless motor. As a<br>
result, even when the sensor-less DC brushless motor is connected to the<br>
controller with a long power lead, there is no problem of trouble such as<br>
voltage drop in the lead wire, enabling reliable position detection of the<br>
sensor-less DC brushless motor, so that it is possible to obtain a highly<br>
reliable heat exchange cooler.<br>
Furthermore, the heat exchange cooler of the present invention<br>
detects the current flowing in the shunt resistor connected to the negative<br><br>
potential terminal of lower arm transistor of three-phase full-bridge inverter<br>
circuit, thereby configuring a position detecting section for the sensor-less<br>
DC brushless motor. As a result, the current detection means can be<br>
formed at a low cost, and it is possible to obtain a low-cost heat exchange<br>
cooler.<br>
v'	As described above, the heat exchange cooler of the present<br>
invention employs a sensor-less type DC brushless motor as the DC<br>
brushless motor for driving the outdoor fan. In this way, it is possible to<br>
eliminate the influences due to the temperature conditions of the place<br>
where the heat exchange cooler is installed. Also, because the use of a long<br>
sensor signal line is not needed, it is possible to provide a highly reliable<br>
and low-cost heat exchange cooler.<br>
Also, the power circuit driving device of the present invention used<br>
for a heat exchange cooler is provided with a commercial power transformer<br>
as a voltage transforming unit which transforms AC voltage supplied from<br>
the heat generating element storing box to the predetermined range of<br>
voltage. Also, the device has a tap switching unit for automatically<br>
switching a plurality of taps of the commercial power transformer coil as a<br>
unit for keeping commercial AC voltage within the predetermined range of<br>
output voltage.<br>
Using the commercial power transformer which transforms the<br>
voltage at a commercial power frequency, it is possible to eliminate a trouble<br>
such as continuous radiation of high-frequency noise waves. Also, since the<br>
plurality of taps disposed at the power transformer are automatically<br>
switched, the man hour for the installation work can be reduced, so that it is<br><br>
possible to eliminate operational mistakes during the installation work.<br>
Also, it is possible to obtain a heat exchange cooler capable of making<br>
automatic adjustment to the predetermined output voltage corresponding to<br>
the variation of commercial AC power.<br>

detection unit.<br>

an input AC voltage detection unit for detecting a relatively wide range of<br>
commercial AC voltage ranging from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage<br><br>
supplied from the heat generating element storing box to the tap switching<br>
unit which automatically switches a plurality of taps of the commercial<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in the following with reference to the drawings.<br>
Preferred embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic structure diagram of a heat exchange cooler 13<br><br>
in the preferred embodiment 1 of the present invention. In Fig. 1, outdoor<br>
sensor-less DC brushless motor 1 drives outdoor fan 2. When outdoor fan 2<br>
operates, the outside air around heat generating element storing box 18 of a<br>
cellular phone operating base station or the like is sucked from outside air<br>
t suction port 14 at the bottom of heat exchange cooler 13.<br>
The sucked air is passed through heat exchanging element 12 and<br>
discharged from outside air discharge port 15 at the top of heat exchange<br>
cooler 13. Indoor fan 4 is driven by indoor DC brushless motor 3, and sucks<br>
the heated air in heat generating element storing box 18 from inside air<br>
suction port 16 at the top of heat exchange cooler 13. The sucked air is<br>
passed through heat exchanging element 12 and discharged from inside air<br>
discharge port 17 disposed at the bottom of heat exchange cooler 13.<br>
The outside air moved by rotation of outdoor fan 2 is represented by<br>
flow F2, and the inside air moved by rotation of indoor fan 4 is represented<br>
by flow F4. Heat exchange is performed when the cool outside air and the<br>
warmed inside air pass through heat exchanging element 12. The outside<br>
air is warmed and discharged into the atmosphere, then the inside air is<br>
cooled and circulated to the indoor side, thereby making it possible to cool<br>
the inside of heat generating element storing box 18. The outside air<br>
passage and the inside air passage are cut off from each other in heat<br>
exchanging element 12, so as to prevent the air in the outside air passage<br>
from flowing into the inside air passage of heat exchange cooler 13.<br>
Control box 9 is installed in the inside air passage of heat exchange<br>
cooler 13. Control box 9 includes rotor position detector 5 of outdoor<br>
sensor-less DC brushless motor 1 shown in Fig. 2, and controller 6 which<br><br>
outputs driving signal to inverter circuit 7 according to the rotor position<br>
detected by rotor position detector 5. Also, inverter circuit 7 is supplied<br>
with a relatively low power voltage from DC power source 10 disposed at<br>
heat generating element storing box 18, and performs switching of<br>
transistors in accordance with driving signals from controller 6 in order to<br>
drive outdoor sensor-less DC brushless motor 1 via driving lead 11. Also,<br>
control box 9 is equipped with an indoor control unit and indoor inverter<br>
circuit for driving indoor DC brushless motor 3 to operate and control indoor<br>
fan 4.<br>
In this configuration, even when heat exchange cooler 13 is installed<br>
in the lowtemperature outside air, outdoor sensor-less DC brushless motor<br>
1 disposed at the low-temperature outside air passage, without a magnetic<br>
sensor such as a Hall element whose operation is unstable at low<br>
temperatures, can be operated according to the rotor position detected by<br>
sensor-less rotor position detector 5. As a result, it is possible to obtain<br>
stable operation by avoiding the influence of the outside air temperature of<br>
the installation place. Also, since no magnetic sensor signal line is<br>
required for making the connection between controller 6 in control box 9<br>
disposed at the inside air passage side, the influence of noise can be avoided,<br>
and it is possible to obtain highly reliable motor drive. Accordingly, no<br>
wiring for signal line is needed, and it is possible to provide a low-cost heat<br>
exchange cooler.<br>
In the preferred embodiment 1, an ordinary magnetic sensor built-in<br>
DC brushless motor is employed as indoor DC brushless motor 3. However,<br>
a motor, which is similar to that at the outdoor side, that is, a sensor-less<br><br>
DC brushless motor which is not equipped with a magnetic sensor may be<br>
employed. In that case, configurations of the position detector, the<br>
controller, and inverter circuit can be the same. In this way, the man hour<br>
for design development can be decreased, and it is possible to provide a<br>
lower-cost heat exchange cooler.<br>
Preferred embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic configuration diagram of a power circuit driving<br>
device used for the preferred embodiment 1 or inverter circuit 7 in<br>
particular in the preferred embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
Inverter circuit 7 is structured by transistors TR1 to TR6 having a switching<br>
function, and a three-phase full-bridge inverter circuit formed of diodes Dl<br>
to D6 connected to the transistors in a reverse parallel fashion. Transistor<br>
TR1 (TR3, TR5) forms an upper arm together with diode Dl (D3, D5).<br>
Transistor TR2 (TR4, TR6) forms a lower arm together with diode D2 (D4,<br>
D6). Shunt resistor 8 is connected between negative potential terminal<br>
GND1 of the lower arm of inverter circuit 7 and negative potential terminal<br>
GND2 of DC power source 10. Voltage generated in shunt resistor 8 is<br>
detected by position detector 5 from the current flowing in inverter circuit 7,<br>
that is, the current flowing in the motor. In this way, the rotor position of<br>
the motor is detected, and controller 6 outputs the driving signal of the<br>
motor to inverter circuit 7 in accordance with the detected rotor position.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram of position detector 5 and controller 6 in the<br>
preferred embodiment 2. Position detector 5 amplifies the voltage across<br>
shunt resistor 8 by amplifier 20 and performs AD (analog to digital)<br><br>
conversion by means of AD converter 21. After that, it is compared with<br>
the current waveform in the predetermined power phase stored in waveform<br>
memory 22 in advance by means of comparator 23. Subsequently,<br>
according to the result of comparison, power changeover timing determining<br>
unit 24 of controller 6 determines whether the timing is good or not, and<br>
changes the timing so that the power is changed over in best timing.<br>
Power changeover timing determining unit 24 outputs a drive signal to<br>
drive circuit 25 to switch the power of inverter circuit 7. In this way, it is<br>
possible to realize the operation for sensor-less position detection in the<br>
predetermined power phase.<br>
Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B are explanatory diagrams showing a sensor-less<br>
position detecting method by detecting the current. Particularly, it shows<br>
current waveforms in power changeover by keeping 60 degree of electric<br>
angle in the case of 120-degree power system. In Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B,<br>
current waveforms 40a and 40b show ideal currents in case of operation in<br>
the specified power phase, and current waveforms 42a and 42b show<br>
currents in actual operation detected by AD converter 21.<br>
Current waveform 42a in Fig. 4A shows the case where power<br>
changeover is slower as compared with the specified power phase. In such<br>
a case, making the power changeover timing faster, it is possible to<br>
approach current waveform 40a and to operate in the specified power phase.<br>
Current waveform 42b in Fig. 4B shows the case where power<br>
changeover is faster as compared with the specified power phase. In such a<br>
case, making the power changeover timing slower, it is possible to approach<br>
current waveform 40b and to operate in the specified power phase.<br><br>
Through the above control, it is possible to detecting the sensor-less<br>
position by current detection. Also, because the motor and the controller<br>
are apart from each other, driving lead 11 for connecting the motor to the<br>
position detector is required to be longer, however it is possible to eliminate<br>
the influence of voltage drop generated in the lead wire and to perform<br>
highly reliable position detection. Also, in case the heat generating<br>
element is a cellular phone base station for example, the DC power used is a<br>
relatively low direct current (DC) power voltage such as 24V and 48V in<br>
many cases. In that case, the motor is driven in a state of flowing of<br>
greater current as compared with the case of being driven with DC power<br>
whose voltage is as high as 141V. Accordingly, the reliability of current<br>
detection is further enhanced, and the operation for position detection is<br>
further improved in reliability. Also, since the current detection can be<br>
performed by using one shunt resistor, it is possible to reduce the size of the<br>
control unit and to obtain a lowcost configuration.<br>
In the preferred embodiments 1 and 2, a method of position<br>
detection by comparing current waveforms in a 120-degree power system<br>
has been discussed. However, the power system is not always required to<br>
be a 120-degree power system, and a 150-degree or 180-degree power system<br>
or other power system may be used. Also, for the method of position<br>
detection, instead of a method of position detection by comparing current<br>
waveforms, for example, a method of position detection by working out an<br>
equation of voltage may be used.<br>
In the preferred embodiment 2 of the present invention, instead of<br>
employing a method of sensor-less position detection using induction voltage,<br><br>
the method is preferable to be a method utilizing current detection.<br>
Preferred embodiment 3<br>
The preferred embodiments 3 to 11 relate to a power circuit driving<br>
device used for a heat exchange cooler. Also, the heat generating element<br>
storing box (not shown) and heat exchange cooler 302 shown in the<br>
preferred embodiments 3 to 11 respectively correspond to heat generating<br>
element storing box 18 and heat exchange cooler 13 described in the<br>
preferred embodiment 1.<br>
In the preferred embodiment 3, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, heat<br>
exchange cooler 302 (corresponding to heat exchange cooler 13 in Fig. 1) for<br>
cooling the heat generating element storing box (not shown) (corresponding<br>
to heat generating element storing box 18 in Fig. l) is supplied with power<br>
from DC power source 306 that is the main power source, and commercial<br>
AC power source 307 that is the auxiliary power source. DC power source<br>
306 is supplied to DC fan motor 305 having a function as an air circulating<br>
means of heat exchange cooler 302 and electronic control unit 304 mounted<br>
with micro-computer 201 having a function as a controller of the cooler.<br>
One phase 307a of commercial AC power source 307 is connected to<br>
common terminal 210c of first relay 210. First relay 210 has a function as<br>
a tap switching unit for automatically switching a plurality of taps disposed<br>
at primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311. For the first<br>
relay 210, a 1C contact type switch element can be employed. Normal<br>
closed terminal 210a of first relay 210 is connected to one of the plurality of<br>
taps disposed at primary coil 31 lp of commercial power transformer 311.<br><br>
Normal open terminal 210b of first relay 210 is connected to common<br>
terminal 212c of second relay 212 prepared as a tap switching unit. For<br>
second relay 212, 1C contact type switch element can be used as well as first<br>
relay 210. Normal closed terminal 212a of second relay 212 is connected to<br>
one of other plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 212b of second relay 212 is<br>
connected to one of remaining plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p<br>
of commercial power transformer 311.<br>
The other phase 307b of commercial AC power source 307 is<br>
connected to common terminal 311pc of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Secondary coil 311s of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 is connected to first diode bridge 312 for full-wave<br>
rectification of output voltage. First capacitor 313 is connected to first<br>
diode bridge 312, and smoothed DC voltage V1 is generated in first capacitor<br>
313. DC voltage V1 is supplied for driving DC fan motor 305 and electronic<br>
control unit 304.<br>
Electronic control unit 304 has a function as an output voltage<br>
detection unit of commercial power transformer 311, and includes first<br>
resistor 203, second resistor 204, and micro-computer 201 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, when AC voltage is applied to primary coil 311p<br>
of commercial power transformer 311 from commercial AC power source 307,<br>
DC voltage V1 is generated at the common connection of first diode bridge<br>
312 and first capacitor 313 connected to secondary coil 311s thereof. DC<br>
voltage V1 is divided by first resistor 203 and second resistor 204, and is<br>
applied to analog input terminal AIN of micro-computer 201. In case the<br><br>
voltage of analog input terminal AIN exceeds the first threshold, for<br>
example, DC voltage V1 is higher than 29V, micro-computer 201 transmits a<br>
command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that first relay 210 is<br>
immediately turned ON. In this case, when common terminal 210c of first<br>
relay 210 is switched to normal open terminal 210b, the circuit is switched<br>
to a tap for increasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of<br>
commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding<br>
ratio of the tap.<br>
The voltage level of commercial AC power source 307 varies with the<br>
level of DC voltage V1. When the voltage of analog input terminal AIN<br>
exceeds the first threshold, microcomputer 201 (electronic control unit 304)<br>
transmits a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that second relay<br>
212 is immediately turned ON. In this case, when common terminal 212c<br>
of second relay 212 is switched to normal open terminal 212b, the circuit is<br>
switched to a tap for further increasing the number of windings of primary<br>
coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side<br>
voltage of commercial power transformer 311 decreases in output depending<br>
upon the winding ratio.<br>
When DC voltage V1 varies due to the voltage alteration of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes lower than the second threshold, for example, DC voltage V1 is<br>
lower than 20V, microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay<br>
driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF.<br>
In this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is<br><br>
switched to normal closed terminal 212b, the circuit is switched to a tap for<br>
decreasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial<br>
power transformer 311 increases in output depending upon the winding<br>
ratio. Microcomputer 201 is provided with a program such that the divided<br>
voltage of DC voltage V1 is monitored, and when it exceeds the first<br>
threshold, first relay 210 and second relay 212 are sequentially turned ON<br>
until the voltage becomes lower than the first threshold through drive and<br>
control, and when it is lower than the second threshold, second relay 212<br>
and first relay 210 are sequentially turned ON until the voltage becomes<br>
higher than the second threshold through drive and control.<br>
In this way, by using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br>
high-frequency noise waves. The level of DC voltage V1 varies in<br>
accordance with the variation of input voltage of commercial AC power 307,<br>
however first relay 210 and second relay 212 are controlled according to the<br>
level of DC voltage V1, and a plurality of taps disposed at commercial power<br>
transformer 311 are automatically switched, and thereby, DC voltage V1<br>
can be kept within the range of specified output voltage, 20 to 29V for<br>
example.<br>
In the preferred embodiment 3, the number of taps of commercial<br>
power transformer 311 is three for the convenience of description, however<br>
four or more taps may be used. These are applicable for the following<br>
preferred embodiments.<br><br>
Preferred embodiment 4<br>
Same reference numerals are given to the same components as in<br>
the conventional example and the preferred embodiment 3. As shown in<br>
Fig. 7, DC power source 306 is connected to DC fan motor 305 having a<br>
function as an air circulating unit installed in heat exchange cooler 302 and<br>
electronic control unit 304 mounted with microcomputer 201 having a<br>
function as the controller of the cooler. Also, commercial AC power source<br>
307 is connected to primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311,<br>
and secondary coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311 is provided<br>
with a tap switching unit for automatically switching a plurality of taps.<br>
The tap switching unit has first relay 210 provided with 1C contact<br>
type switch element for example. One of the taps is connected to normal<br>
closed terminal 210a of first relay 210, and common terminal 212c of second<br>
relay 212 is connected to normal open terminal 210b of first relay 210.<br>
Second relay 212 has 1C contact type switch element the same as for first<br>
relay 210, and it is provided with a function as a tap switching unit for<br>
automatically switching a plurality of taps disposed at secondary coil 311s of<br>
commercial power transformer 311.<br>
Normal closed terminal 212a of second relay 212 is connected to one<br>
of other plurality of taps disposed at secondary coil 311s of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Normal closed terminal 212b of second relay 212 is<br>
connected to one of the remaining plurality of taps disposed at secondary<br>
coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311. Common terminal 210c of<br>
first relay 210 and common terminal 311sc of the secondary coil of<br><br>
commercial power transformer 311 are connected to first diode bridge 312.<br>
First capacitor 313 is connected to the output side of first diode bridge 312,<br>
and smoothed DC voltage V1 is generated in first capacitor 313. DC<br>
voltage V1 is supplied to DC fan motor 305 and electronic control unit 304.<br>
The AC voltage applied from commercial AC power source 307 to the<br>
primary side of commercial power transformer 311 causes the generation of<br>
DC voltage V1 from the secondary side thereof. DC voltage V1 is divided<br>
by first resistor 203 and second resistor 204 and applied to analog input<br>
terminal AIN of microcomputer 201. In case the voltage of analog input<br>
terminal AIN exceeds the first threshold, for example, DC voltage V1 is<br>
higher than 29V, microcomputer 201 (electronic control unit 304) sends a<br>
command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that first relay 210 is<br>
immediately turned ON.<br>
When common terminal 210c of first relay 210 is switched to normal<br>
open terminal 210b, the circuit is switched to a tap for increasing the<br>
number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer<br>
311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial power transformer 311<br>
decreases in output depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies due to voltage alteration of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN exceeds the first threshold, microcomputer 201 sends a command signal<br>
to relay driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned<br>
ON.<br>
When common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to<br>
normal open terminal 212b, the circuit is switched to a tap for further<br><br>
increasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies due to the voltage alteration<br>
of commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes lower than the second threshold, for example, DC voltage V1 is<br>
lower than 20V, microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay<br>
driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF. In<br>
this case, when the contact of second relay 212 is switched to normal closed<br>
terminal 212b, the circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing the number of<br>
windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311, then<br>
the secondary side voltage of commercial power transformer 311 increases<br>
depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
In this way, by using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br>
high-frequency noise waves. The level of DC voltage V1 varies in<br>
accordance with the variation of input voltage of commercial AC power<br>
source 307. However, first relay 210 and second relay 212 are operated and<br>
controlled according to the level of DC voltage V1, and a plurality of taps<br>
disposed at commercial power transformer 311 can be automatically<br>
switched. In this way, DC voltage V1 that is a specified output voltage can<br>
be kept within a specified range from 20 to 29V for example.<br>
Preferred embodiment 5<br><br>
The same components as for the conventional example and the<br>
preferred embodiment 3 are given same reference numerals. As shown in<br>
Fig. 8, one phase 307a of commercial AC power source 307 is connected to<br>
common terminal 210c of first relay 210.<br>
First relay 210 is prepared as a tap switching unit for automatically<br>
switching a plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311, which can be, for example, formed of 1C contact<br>
type switch element. Normal closed terminal 210a of first relay 210 is<br>
connected to one of the plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p of<br>
commercial power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 210b of first<br>
relay 210 is connected to one of the plurality of taps disposed at primary coil<br>
311p of commercial power transformer 311. Other phase 307b of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 is connected to common terminal 311pc of<br>
the primary coil of commercial power transformer 311.<br>
Second relay 212 has a function as a tap switching unit for<br>
automatically switching a plurality of taps disposed at secondary coil 311s of<br>
commercial power transformer 311, which is, for example, formed of 1C<br>
contact type switch element. Normal closed terminal 212a of second relay<br>
212 is connected to one of the taps. Normal open terminal 212b of second<br>
relay 212 is connected to one of the remaining plurality of taps disposed at<br>
secondary coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311.<br>
Common terminal 212c of second relay 212 and common terminal<br>
311sc of secondary coil of commercial power transformer 311 are connected<br>
to first diode bridge 312. When AC voltage is taken out by secondary coil<br>
311s of commercial power transformer 311 and full-wave rectified by first<br><br>
diode bridge 312, and further, smoothed by first capacitor 313, then DC<br>
voltage V1 is generated. DC voltage V1 is supplied to DC fan motor 305<br>
and electronic control unit 304.<br>
In the above configuration, DC voltage V1 is generated from AC<br>
voltage applied from commercial AC power source 307 to commercial power<br>
transformer 311, and DC voltage V1 is divided by first resistor 203 and<br>
 second resistor 204 and is applied to analog input terminal AIN of<br>
microcomputer 201.<br>
When the voltage of analog input terminal AIN exceeds the first<br>
threshold, for example, DC voltage V1 is higher than 29V, microcomputer<br>
201 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that first relay<br>
210 is immediately turned ON. In this case, when common terminal 210c<br>
of first relay 210 is switched to normal open terminal 210b, the circuit is<br>
switched to a tap for increasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p<br>
of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding<br>
ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies due to the voltage alteration<br>
of commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes higher than the first threshold, microcomputer 201 (electronic<br>
control unit 304) sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that<br>
second relay 212 is immediately turned ON. In this case, when common<br>
terminal 211c of second relay 212 is switched to normal open terminal 212b,<br>
the circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing the number of windings of<br>
secondary coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311, then the<br><br>
secondary side voltage of commercial power transformer 311 increases<br>
depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies due to the voltage alteration<br>
of commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes lower than the second threshold, for example, DC voltage V1 is<br>
lower than 20V, microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay<br>
driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF. In<br>
this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to<br>
normal closed terminal 212a, the circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing<br>
the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
In this way, using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br>
high-frequency noise waves. DC voltage V1 varies with the variation of<br>
input voltage of commercial AC power source 307. However, first relay 210<br>
and second relay 212 are controlled according to the level of DC voltage V1,<br>
and thereby, a plurality of taps disposed at commercial power transformer<br>
311 can be automatically switched, and it is possible to keep DC voltage V1,<br>
specified output voltage, within a specified range from 20V to 29V for<br>
example.<br>

element such as 1C contact type relay can be employed.<br>
Normal closed terminal 210a of first relay 210 is connected to one of<br>
the plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p of commercial power<br>
transformer 311. Normal open terminal 210b of first relay 210 is connected<br>
to common terminal 212c of second relay 212. Second relay 212 has a<br>
function of switching a plurality of taps disposed at primary coil 311p of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 the same as in first relay 210. Second<br>
relay 212 has a function as a switch element, and for example, 1C contact<br>
type relay can be employed. Normal closed terminal 212a of second relay<br>
212 is connected to one of other plurality of taps disposed at primary coil<br>
311p of commercial power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 212b of<br>
second relay 212 is connected to one of a plurality of taps disposed at the<br>
primary coil of commercial power transformer 311.<br>

is connected to first diode bridge 312 prepared for full-wave rectification,<br>
and first capacitor 313 is connected to first diode bridge 312. Smoothed DC<br>
voltage V1 is generated in first capacitor 313. DC voltage V1 is supplied to<br><br>
DC fan motor 305 and electronic control unit 304.<br>
The preferred embodiment 6 includes input voltage detector 206<br>
unlike the preferred embodiments so far described. Input voltage detector<br>
206 is prepared for the purpose of detecting the level of commercial AC<br>
voltage in a relatively wide range from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage.<br>
The input side of input voltage detector 206 is connected to<br>
commercial AC power source 307, and the output side thereof is connected<br>
to electronic control unit 304. Also, input voltage detector 206 includes, as<br>
shown in Fig. 10, voltage transformer 207 connected to commercial AC<br>
power source 307, second diode bridge 208 for rectifying the output voltage<br>
at the secondary side, and second capacitor 209. DC voltage V2 smoothed<br>
by second capacitor 209 is applied to analog input terminal AIN of<br>
microcomputer 201 installed in electronic control unit 304.<br>
In the above configuration, when the voltage of analog input<br>
terminal AIN of microcomputer 201 exceeds the first threshold, for example,<br>
the level of input voltage of commercial AC power source 307 becomes<br>
higher than 220V, then microcomputer 201 (electronic control unit 304)<br>
sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that first relay 210 is<br>
immediately turned ON. In this case, when common terminal 210c of first<br>
relay 210 is switched to normal open terminal 210b, the circuit is switched<br>
to a tap for increasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of<br>
commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding<br>
ratio. After that, DC voltage V1 varies in accordance with the change in<br>
voltage level of commercial AC power source 307, and when the voltage of<br><br>
analog input terminal AIN exceeds the first threshold, microcomputer 201 (<br>
electronic control unit 304) sends a command signal to relay driving circuit<br>
205 so that second relay 212 is turned ON. In this case, when common<br>
terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to normal open terminal 212b,<br>
the circuit is switched to a tap for further increasing the number of<br>
windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311, then<br>
the secondary side voltage of commercial power transformer 311 decreases<br>
depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V2 varies due to the voltage alteration<br>
of commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes lower than the second threshold, for example, the input<br>
voltage of commercial AC power source 307 is lower than AC 240V ,<br>
electronic control unit 304 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit<br>
205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF.<br>
In this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is<br>
switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the circuit is switched to a tap for<br>
decreasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial<br>
power transformer 311 increases depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
In this way, using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br>
high-frequency noise waves. DC voltage V1 changes in accordance with the<br>
variation of input voltage of commercial AC power source 307. However,<br>
setting the winding ratio of primary coil 311p and secondary coil 311s of<br><br>
commercial power transformer 311 to a specified output voltage, it is<br>
possible to operate and control first relay 210 and second relay 212<br>
according to the level of DC voltage V2 and to automatically switch a<br>
plurality of taps disposed at commercial power transformer 311. As a<br>
7<br>
result, it is possible to keep DC voltage V1, specified output voltage, within<br>
a specified range from 20 to 29V for example.<br>
Preferred embodiment 7<br>
The same components as in the conventional example and the<br>
preferred embodiments 3, 6 are given same reference numerals. As shown<br>
in Fig. 11, DC power source 306 is supplied to electronic control unit 304<br>
mounted with microcomputer 201, having a function of DC fan motor 305<br>
and cooler controller, as an air circulating unit installed in heat exchange<br>
cooler 302. Commercial AC power source 307 is connected to primary coil<br>
311p of commercial power transformer 311.<br>
First relay 210 and second relay 212 as tap switching unit for<br>
automatically switching a plurality of taps are connected to secondary coil<br>
311s of commercial power transformer 311. For the two relays, 1C contact<br>

are connected to first diode bridge 312 for the purpose of full-wave<br>
rectification.<br>
First capacitor 313 is connected to first diode bridge 312, and<br>
smoothed DC voltage V1 is generated in first capacitor 313. DC voltage V1<br>
is supplied to DC fan motor 305 and electronic control unit 304.<br>
Also, the preferred embodiment 7 includes input voltage detector<br>
206 the same as for the preferred embodiment 6. Input voltage detector<br>
206 as described above serves to detect the level of commercial AC voltage in<br>
a relatively wide range from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage. Commercial<br>

second capacitor 209. DC voltage V2 smoothed by second capacitor 209 is<br>
applied to analog input terminal AIN of microcomputer 201 installed in<br>
electronic control unit 304.<br>
In the above configuration, when the voltage of analog input<br>
terminal AIN of microcomputer 201 exceeds the first threshold, for example,<br>
the input voltage of commercial AC power source 307 is higher than 220V,<br>
electronic control unit 304 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit<br>
205 so that first relay 210 is turned ON. In this case, when common<br><br>
terminal 210c of first relay 210 is switched to normal open terminal 210b,<br>
the circuit is switched to a tap for increasing the number of windings of the<br>
primary coil of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side<br><br>
voltage of commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the<br>
winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies in accordance with the<br>
voltage alteration of commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of<br>
analog input terminal AIN becomes higher than the first threshold,<br>
electronic control unit 304 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit<br>
205 so that second relay 212 is turned ON. In this case, when common<br>
terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to normal open terminal 212b,<br>
the circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing the number of windings of<br>
primary coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary<br>
side voltage of commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon<br>
the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V2 varies due to the voltage alteration<br>
of commercial AC power 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal AIN<br>
becomes lower than the second threshold, for example, the input voltage of<br>
commercial AC power 307 is lower than AC 240V, electronic control unit 304<br>
(microcomputer 201) sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so<br>
that second relay 212 is turned OFF. In this case, when common terminal<br>
212c of second relay 212 is switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the<br>
circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing the number of windings of the<br>
primary coil of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side<br>
Yoltage of commercial power transformer 311 increases depending upon the<br><br>

In this way, using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br>
high-frequency noise waves. DC voltage V1 changes in accordance with the<br>
variation of input voltage of commercial AC power source 307. However,<br>
setting the winding ratio of primary coil 311p and secondary coil 311s of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 to a specified output voltage, it is<br>
possible to operate and control first relay 210 and second relay 212<br>
according to the level of DC voltage V2 and to automatically switch a<br>

thereby, it is possible to keep the specified DC voltage V1 within a<br>
predetermined range from 20 to 29V for example.<br>
Preferred embodiment 8<br>
The same components as in the conventional example and the<br>
preferred embodiments 3, 6 are given same reference numerals. As shown<br>

type switch element for example that is a tap switching unit for<br>
automatically switching a plurality of taps disposed at the primary coil of<br>
commercial power transformer 311. Normal closed terminal 210a of first<br>
relay 210 is connected to one of the plurality of taps disposed at primary coil<br>
311p of commercial power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 210b of<br>
first relay 210 is connected to the remaining plurality of taps disposed at the<br><br>
primary coil of commercial power transformer 311.<br>
The other phase 307b of commercial AC power source 307 is<br>
connected to common terminal 311ps of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Second relay 212 is prepared as a tap switching<br>
unit for automatically switching a plurality of taps disposed at secondary<br>
coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311, and one of the taps is<br>

contact type switch element for example.<br>
Normal open terminal 212b of second relay 212 is connected to one<br>
of the remaining plurality of taps disposed at secondary coil 311s of<br>
commercial power transformer 311. Common terminal 212c of second relay<br>
212 and common terminal 311sc of secondary coil 311s of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 are connected to first diode bridge 312. When AC voltage<br>
is full-wave rectified by first diode bridge 312 and smoothed by first<br>
capacitor 313, DC voltage V1 is generated. DC voltage V1 is supplied to<br>
DC fan motor 305 and electronic control unit 304.<br>
Also, for input voltage detector 206 as an input AC voltage detecting<br>
means for detecting the level of commercial AC voltage in a relatively wide<br>
range from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage, voltage transformer 207 is<br>
connected to commercial AC power source 307. The secondary side output<br>
voltage of voltage transformer 207 is smoothed by second diode bridge 208<br>
and second capacitor 209. The smoothed DC voltage V2 is applied to<br>
analog input terminal AIN of microcomputer 201 of electronic control unit<br>
304.<br>
In the above configuration, when the voltage of analog input<br><br>
terminal AIN of microcomputer 201 exceeds the first threshold, for example,<br>
the input voltage of commercial AC power source 307 is higher than 220V,<br>
then microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205<br>
so that first relay 210 is immediately turned ON.<br>
In this case, when common terminal 210c of first relay 210 is<br>
switched to normal open terminal 210b, the circuit is switched to a tap for<br>
increasing the number of windings of the primary coil of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the voltage of the secondary side of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V1 varies due to voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 for example and the voltage of analog<br>
input terminal AIN exceeds the first threshold, microcomputer 201 sends a<br>

coil 311p of commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side<br>
voltage of commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the<br>
winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V2 varies due to voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 for example and the voltage of analog<br>
input terminal AIN becomes lower than the second threshold, for example,<br>
the input voltage of commercial AC power 307 is lower than AC240V, a<br>
command signal is transmitted to relay driving circuit 205 so that second<br>
relay 212 is immediately turned OFF. In this case, when common terminal<br><br>
212c of second relay 212 is switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the<br>

upon the winding ratio.<br>
In this way, using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate continuous radiation of high-frequency noise waves.<br>
Also, DC voltage V1 changes in accordance with the variation of input<br>
voltage of commercial AC power source 307. However, setting the winding<br>
ratio of primary coil 311p and secondary coil 311s of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 to a predetermined output voltage in advance, it is possible<br>
to operate and control first relay 210 and second relay 212 according to the<br>

Electronic control unit 304 includes first resistor 203, second resistor<br>
204, and microcomputer 201 as an output voltage detection unit of<br>
commercial power transformer 311. Also, input voltage detector 206 is<br>
prepared as an input AC voltage detection unit for detecting the level of<br>
commercial AC voltage in a relatively wide range from 200V to 250V in<br>
nominal voltage.<br>
Input voltage detector 206 is, as described above, prepared for<br>
detecting the level of commercial AC voltage in a relatively wide range, for<br>
example, from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage. The input side of input<br>
voltage detector 206 is connected to commercial AC power source 307, and<br>
the output side thereof is connected to electronic control unit 304. Also,<br>

transformer 207. DC voltage V2 smoothed by second capacitor 209 is<br>
applied to analog input terminal AIN2 of microcomputer 201 installed in<br>
electronic control unit 304.<br>
In the above configuration, the divided voltage of DC voltage V1 and<br>
DC voltage V2 are applied to analog input terminals AIN1 and AIN2 of<br>
microcomputer 201. When the voltage of analog input terminal AIN2 of<br>
microcomputer 201 exceeds the first threshold, for example, the input<br>
voltage of commercial AC power source 307 is higher than 220V, then<br>
microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so<br><br>

increasing the number of windings of the primary coil of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V2 varies due to voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 for example and the voltage of analog<br>
input terminal AIN exceeds the first threshold, microcomputer 201 sends a<br>
command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is<br>

In this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is<br>
switched to normal open terminal 212b, the circuit is switched to a tap for<br>
further increasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of<br>
commercial power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of<br>
commercial power transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding<br>
ratio.<br>
After that, when DC voltage V2 varies due to voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 for example and the voltage of analog<br>
input terminal AIN2 becomes lower than the second threshold, for example,<br>
the input voltage of commercial AC power 307 is lower than AC240V,<br>
microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so<br>
that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF.<br>
In this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is<br>
switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the circuit is switched to a tap for<br><br>
decreasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311, then the voltage of the secondary side of commercial<br>
power transformer 311 increases depending upon the winding ratio. In<br>
this condition, when DC voltage V1 varies and the voltage of analog input<br>
terminal AIN1 exceeds the third threshold, for example, the voltage of DC<br>

After that, when DC voltage V1 changes due to voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal<br>
AIN becomes lower than the fourth threshold, for example, the voltage of<br>
DC voltage V1 is lower than 20V, microcomputer 201 sends a command<br>
signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately<br>
turned OFF. In this case, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212<br>
is switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the circuit is switched to a tap<br>
for decreasing the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial<br>
power transformer 311 increases in output according to the winding ratio.<br>

transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br><br>

Also, with first relay 210 and second relay 212 operated in accordance with<br>
the input voltage variation of commercial AC power source 307, and further,<br>
first relay 210 and second relay 212 readily operated and controlled in<br>
accordance with the variation of DC voltage V1, it is possible to<br>
automatically switch a plurality of taps disposed at commercial power<br>

of first relay 210 is connected to one of the taps of secondary coil 311s of<br>
commercial power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 210b of first<br>
relay 210 is connected to common terminal 212c of second relay 212. Each<br>
of first relay 210 and second relay 212 is prepared as a tap switching unit<br>
for switching a plurality of taps disposed at the secondary coil of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Also, these two relays can be formed by 1C contact<br>
type switch element.<br>

of other plurality of taps disposed at secondary coil 311p of commercial<br>
power transformer 311. Normal open terminal 212b of second relay 212 is<br>

Common terminal 210c of first relay 210 and common terminal<br>
311sc of secondary coil 311s of commercial power transformer 311 are<br>
connected to first diode bridge 312. The voltage full-wave rectified by first<br>
diode bridge 312 is smoothed by first capacitor 313, and DC voltage V1 is<br>
generated. DC voltage V1 is supplied to DC fan motor 305 and electronic<br>
control unit 304.<br>
Also, the preferred embodiment 10 includes input voltage detector<br>

detection unit for detecting the level of commercial AC voltage in a<br>
relatively wide range from 200V to 250V in nominal voltage. The input<br>

installed in electronic control unit 304.<br>
In the above configuration, the divided voltage of DC voltage V1 and<br>
DC voltage V2 are respectively applied to analog input terminals AIN1 and<br>

commercial AC power source 307 for example and the voltage of analog<br>
input terminal AIN2 becomes lower than the second threshold, for example,<br>
the input voltage of commercial AC power 307 is lower than AC240V, a<br>
command signal is transmitted to relay driving circuit 205 so that second<br>
relay 212 is immediately turned OFF. In this case, when common terminal<br>
212c of second relay 212 is switched to normal closed terminal 212a, the<br>
circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing the number of windings of the<br>
primary coil of commercial power transformer 311, then the output voltage<br><br>
of the secondary side of commercial power transformer 311 increases<br>
depending upon the winding ratio.<br>
In this condition, when DC voltage V1 varies and the voltage of<br>
analog input terminal AIN1 exceeds the third threshold, for example, the<br>
voltage of DC voltage V1 is higher than 29V, microcomputer 201 sends a<br>
command signal to relay driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is<br>
immediately turned ON.<br>
Also, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to<br>
normal open terminal 212b, the circuit is switched to a tap for increasing<br>
the number of windings of secondary coil 311s of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the second side voltage of commercial power<br>
transformer 311 decreases depending upon the winding ratio. After that,<br>
when DC voltage V1 changes due to voltage variation of commercial AC<br>
power source 307 and the voltage of analog input terminal AIN1 to become<br>
lower than the fourth threshold, for example, the voltage of DC voltage V1 is<br>
lower than 20V, microcomputer 201 sends a command signal to relay<br>
driving circuit 205 so that second relay 212 is immediately turned OFF.<br>
Also, when common terminal 212c of second relay 212 is switched to<br>
normal closed terminal 212a, the circuit is switched to a tap for decreasing<br>
the number of windings of primary coil 311p of commercial power<br>
transformer 311, then the secondary side voltage of commercial power<br>

In this way, using commercial power transformer 311 which<br>
transforms the voltage at the commercial power source frequency, it is<br>
possible to eliminate a trouble such as continuous radiation of<br><br>
high-frequency noise waves. Also, with first relay 210 and second relay 212<br>
operated and controlled in accordance with the input voltage variation of<br>
commercial AC power source 307, and further, first relay 210 and second<br>
relay 212 readily operated and controlled in accordance with the variation of<br>
