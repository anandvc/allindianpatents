SOLAR CONTROL MULTILAYER FILM<br>
Background<br>
The present invention generally relates to solar control multilayer film, The present invention more particularly relates to solar control multilayer film that includes infrared absorbing nanoparticles.<br>
Dyed and vacuum-coated plastic films have been applied to windows to reduce heat load due to sunlight. To reduce heat load, solar transmission is blocked in either the visible or the infrared portions of the solar spectrum (i.e., at wavelengths ranging from 400 run to 2500 nm or greater.)<br>
Primarily through absorption, dyed films can control the transmission of visible light and consequently provides glare reduction. However, dyed films generally do not block near-infrared solar energy and consequently are not completely effective as solar control films. Dyed films also often fade with solar exposure. In addition, when films are colored with multiple dyes,4he dyes often fade at different rates, causing an unwanted color changes over the life of the film,<br>
Other known window films are fabricated using vacuum-deposited grey metals, such as stainless steel, inconel, monel, chrome, or nichrome alloys. The deposited grey metal films offer about the same degrees of transmission in the visible and infrared portions of the solar spectrum. As a result, the grey metal films are an improvement over dyed films with regard to solar control. The grey metal films are relatively stable when exposed to lights oxygen, and/or moisture, and in those cases in which the transmission of the coatings increases due to oxidation, color changes are generally not detectable. After application to clear glass, grey metals block light transmission by approximately equal amounts of solar reflection and absorption.<br>
Vacuum-deposited layers such as silver, aluminum, and copper control solar radiation primarily by reflection and are useful only in a limited number of applications due to the high level of visible reflectance. A modest degree of selectivity (i.e., higher visible transmission than infrared transmission) is afforded by certain reflective materials, such as copper and silver.<br><br>
There is a need for improved solar control film that has a high visible light transmission and substantially blocks infrared radiation.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The solar control multilayer film of the present invention is believed to be applicable to a variety of applications needing solar control including, for example, architectural and transportation applications. In some embodiments, the solar control multilayer film article includes an infrared absorbing nanoparticle layer disposed on an infrared reflecting multilayer film. In other embodiments, the solar control multilayer film article includes an infrared reflecting multilayer film disposed between an infrared absorbing nanoparticle layer and an adhesive layer. The solar control film can be adhered to an optical substrate such as, for example, a glass substrate. These examples, and the examples discussed below, provide an appreciation of the applicability of the disclosed solar control multilayer film, but should not be interpreted in a limiting sense.<br>
The term "polymer" or "polymeric" will be understood to include polymers, copolymers (e.g., polymers formed using two or more different monomers), oligomers and combinations thereof, as well as polymers, oligomers, or copolymers. Both block and random copolymers are included, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing feature sizes, amounts, and physical properties used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the foregoing specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the teachings disclosed herein.<br>
Weight percent, wt%, percent by weight, % by weight, and the like are synonyms that refer to the concentration of a substance as the weight of that substance divided by the weight of the composition and multiplied by 100.<br>
The term "adjacent" refers to one element being in close proximity to another element and includes the elements touching one another and further includes the elements being separated by one or more layers disposed between the elements.<br><br>
The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers subsumed within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5) and any range within that range.<br>
As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a composition containing "a nanoparticle layer" includes two or more nanoparticle layers. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term "or" is generally employed in its sense including "and/or" unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
This disclosure generally describes multilayer film that includes an infrared absorbing nanoparticle layer disposed on polymeric multilayer film. In many embodiments, an infrared light reflecting multilayer film has alternating layers of a first polymer type and a second polymer type, and an infrared light absorbing nanoparticle layer is adjacent the multilayer film. The nanoparticle layer includes a plurality of metal oxide nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the multilayer film is disposed adjacent to an optical substrate such as glass to form a solar control article. In some embodiments, the multilayer film has an average visible light transmission of at least 45% and an average infrared transmission for 780 nm to 2500 nm light of less than 15%.<br>
FIGs. 1A-1C, 2 and 3 are optical transmission and reflection spectra of films prepared according to Examples 1-3.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates multilayer optical film 20. The film includes individual layers 22,24. The layers have different refractive index characteristics so that some light is reflected at interfaces between adjacent layers. The layers are sufficiently thin so that light reflected at a plurality of the interfaces undergoes constructive or destructive interference in order to give the film the desired reflective or transmissive properties. For optical films designed to reflect light at ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared wavelengths, each layer generally has an optical thickness (i.e., a physical thickness multiplied by refractive index) of less than about 1 micrometer. Thicker layers can, however, also be included, such as skin layers at the outer surfaces of the film, or protective boundary layers disposed within the film that separate packets of layers.<br><br>
The reflective and transmissive properties of multilayer optical film 20 are a function of the refractive indices of the respective layers (i.e., microlayers). Each layer can be characterized at least in localized positions in the film by in-plane refractive indices nx, ny, and a refractive index nz associated with a thickness axis of the film. These indices represent the refractive index of the subject material for light polarized along mutually orthogonal x-, y- and z-axes, respectively (see FIG. 4). In practice, the refractive indices are controlled by judicious materials selection and processing conditions. Film 20 can be made by co-extrusion of typically tens or hundreds of layers of two alternating polymers A, B, followed by optionally passing the multilayer extrudate through one or more multiplication dies, and then stretching or otherwise orienting the extrudate to form a final film. The resulting film is composed of typically tens or hundreds of individual layers whose thicknesses and refractive indices are tailored to provide one or more reflection bands in desired region(s) of the spectrum, such as in the visible, near infrared, and/or infrared.' In order to achieve high reflectivities with a reasonable number of layers, adjacent layers preferably exhibit a difference in refractive index (∆nx) for light polarized along the x-axis of at least 0.05. In some embodiments, if the high reflectivity is desired for two orthogonal polarizations, then the adjacent layers also exhibit a difference in refractive index (∆ny) for light polarized along the y-axis of at least 0.05. In other embodiments, the refractive index difference ∆ny can be less than 0.05 or 0 to produce a multilayer stack that reflects normally incident light of one polarization state and transmits normally incident light of an orthogonal polarization state,<br>
If desired, the refractive index difference (∆nz) between adjacent layers for light polarized along the z-axis can also be tailored to achieve desirable reflectivity properties for the p-polarization component of obliquely incident light. For ease of explanation, at any point of interest on a multilayer optical film the x-axis will be considered to be oriented within the plane of the film such that the magnitude of ∆nx is a maximum. Hence, the magnitude of ∆ny can be equal to or less than (but not greater than) the magnitude of ∆nx. Furthermore, the selection of which material layer to begin with in calculating the differences ∆n*, ∆ny&gt; ∆nz is dictated by requiring that ∆nx be non-negative. In other words, the refractive index differences between two layers forming an interface<br><br>
are ∆nj = njj - n2j, where j = x, y, or z and where the layer designations 1, 2 are chosen so that n!x &gt; n2x., i.e.. ∆n* &gt; 0.<br>
To maintain high reflectivity of p-polarized light at oblique angles of incidence, the z-index mismatch Anz between layers can be controlled to be substantially less than the maximum in-plane refractive index difference ∆nx, such that ∆nz

In such polymeric multilayer optical films, polymer materials are used predominantly or exclusively in the makeup of the individual layers. Such films can be compatible with high volume manufacturing processes, and may be made in large sheets and roll goods.<br>
The multilayer film can be formed by any useful combination of alternating polymer type layers. In many embodiments, at least one of the alternating polymer layers is birefringent and oriented. In some embodiments, one of the alternating polymer layer is birefringent and orientated and the other alternating polymer layer is isotropic. In one embodiment, the multilayer optical film is formed by alternating layers of a first polymer type including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or copolymer of polyethylene terephthalate (coPET) and a second polymer type including poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or a copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (coPMMA).

The nanoparticle layer described above can include a plurality of metal oxide nanoparticles. A partial listing of metal oxide nanoparticles includes tin, antimony, indium and zinc oxides and doped oxides. In some embodiments, the metal oxide nanoparticles include, tin oxide, antimony oxide, indium oxide, indium doped tin oxide, antimony doped indium tin oxide, antinomy tin oxide, antimony doped tin oxide or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the metal oxide nanoparticles include tin oxide or doped tin oxide and optionally further includes antimony oxide and/or indium oxide.<br><br>

In some embodiments, the metal oxide nanoparticles include antimony tin oxide or doped antimony tin oxide dispersed in a polymeric material. The polymeric material can be any useful binder material such as, for example, polyolefin, polyacrylate, polyester, polycarbonate, fluoropolymer, and the like.<br>
In many embodiments, the binder is a cured polymeric material that can function as a hardcoat Suitable polymeric binders to form the infrared light absorbing nanoparticle layer include the thermal and/or U.V.-polymerized (i.e., cured) products of acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers. A suitable cured binder is the thermal and/or U.V.-polymerized product of a brominated, alkyl-substituted phenyl acrylate or methacrylate (e.g., 4,6-dibromo-2-sec-butyl phenyl acrylate), a methyl styrene monomer, a brominated epoxy diacrylate, 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate, and a hexa-functional aromatic urethane acrylate oligomer, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,355,754, incorporated herein by reference. While most types of energy polymerizable telechelic monomers and oligomers are useful for forming these polymeric binders, acrylates are preferred because of their high reactivity. The curable binder composition should be of flowable viscosity that is low enough that air bubbles do not become entrapped in the composition. Reactive diluents can be mono- or di- functional monomers such as, for example, SR-339, SR-256, SR-379, SR-395, SR-440, SR-506, CD-611, SR-212, SR-230, SR-238, and SR-247 available from Sartomer Co., Exton, PA. Typical useful oligomers and oligomeric blends include CN-<br>
120, CN-104, CN-115, CN-116, CN-117, CN-118, CN-119, CN-970A60, CN-972, CN-973A80, CN-975 available from Sartomer Co,, Exton, PA and Ebecryl 1608, 3200, 3201, 3302, 3605, 3700, 3701, 608, RDX-51027, 220, 9220, 4827, 4849, 6602, 6700-20T available from Surface Specialties, Smyrna, GA. Additionally, a multi-functional crosslinker can assist in providing a durable, high crosslink density composite matrix. Examples of multi-functional monomers include SR-295, SR-444, SR-351, SR-399, SR-355, and SR-368 available from Sartomer Co., Exton, PA and PETA-K, PETIA and TMPTA-N available from Surface Specialties, Smyrna, GA. Multi-functional monomers can be used as crosslinking agents to increase the glass transition temperature of the binder polymer that results from the polymerizing of the polymerizable composition.<br><br>
In some embodiments, monomer compositions useful for forming the polymeric binder can have a melting point that is below about 50° C. The monomer composition can be a liquid at room temperature. Monomer compositions useful for forming the polymeric binder can be polymerized by conventional free radical polymerization methods. Examples of initiators include, organic peroxides, azo compounds, quinines, nitre compounds, acyl halides, hydrazones, mercapto compounds, pyrylium compounds, imidazoles, chlorotriazines, benzoin, benzoin alkyl ethers, di-ketones, phenones, and the like. Commercially available photoinitiators include, but not limited to, those available commercially from Ciba Geigy under the trade designations DARACUR 1173, DAROCUR 4265, IRGACURE 651, IRGACURE 1800, IRGACURE 369, IRGACURE 1700, and IRGACURE 907, IRGACURE 819. Phosphine oxide derivatives are preferred, such as LUCIRIN TPO, which is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoy diphenyl phosphine oxide, available from BASF, Charlotte, N.C. A photoinitiator can be used at a concentration of about 0.1 to 10 weight percent or about 0.1 to 5 weight percent.<br>
The polymerizable composition can form a hard resin or hardcoat. The term "hard resin" or "hardcoat" means that the resulting cured polymer exhibits an elongation at break of less than 50 or 40 or 30 or 20 or 10 or 5 percent when evaluated according to the ASTM D-882-91 procedure. In some embodiments, the hard resin polymer can exhibit a tensile modulus of greater than 100 kpsi (6.89x108 pascals) when evaluated according to the ASTM D-882-91 procedure. In some embodiments, the hard resin polymer can exhibit a haze value of less than 10 % or less than 5% when tested in a Taber abrader according to ASTM D 1044-99 under a load of 500g and 50 cycles (haze can be measured with Haze-Gai'd Plus, BYK- Gardner, MD, haze meter.<br>
In some embodiments, the metal oxide nanoparticles include indium tin oxide or doped indium tin oxide dispersed in a polymeric material. The nanoparticle layer can have any useful thickness such as, for example, from 1 to 10 or 2 to 8 micrometers. The nanoparticle layer can include nanoparticles at any useful loading or wt% such as, for example, 30 to 90 wt%, 40 to 80 wt%, or 50 to 80 wt%. In many embodiments, the nanoparticle layer is nonconducting. Nanoparticle compositions are commercially available from, for example, Advanced Nano Products Co., LTD., South Korea, under the tradenames TRB-PASTE™ SM6080(B), SH7080, SL6060. In another embodiment, the<br><br>
metal oxide nanoparticles include zinc oxide and/or aluminum oxide, such oxides are available from GfE Metalle und Materialien GmbH, Germany.<br>
The pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) layer described above can any type of adhesive that enables the solar control multilayer film to be affixed to the glass, In order to attach the solar control film to the glass, one surface of the solar control film, is coated with the pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and a release sheet is removed from the PSA before application of the film to the glass. Ultra-violet absorption additives can be incorporated into the PSA, In many embodiments, the PSA is an optically clear PSA film such as a polyacrylate pressure sensitive adhesive. The Pressure-Sensitive Tape Council has defined pressure sensitive adhesives as material with the following properties: (1) aggressive and permanent tack, (2) adherence with no more than finger pressure, (3) sufficient ability to hold onto an adherand, (4) sufficient cohesive strength, and (5) requires no activation by an energy source. PSAs are normally tacky at assembly temperatures, which is typically room temperature or greater (i.e., about 20°C to about 30°C or greater). Materials that have been found to function well as PSAs are polymers designed and formulated to exhibit the requisite viscoelastic properties resulting in a desired balance of tack, peel adhesion, and shear holding power at the assembly temperature. The most commonly used polymers for preparing PSAs are natural rubber-, synthetic rubber- (e.g., styrene/butadiene copolymers (SBR) and styrene/isoprene/styrene (SIS) block copolymers), silicone elastomer-, poly alpha-olefin-, and various (meth) acrylate- (e.g., acry late and methacrylate) based polymers. Of these, (meth)acrylate-based polymer PSAs have evolved as a preferred class of PSA for the present invention due to their optical clarity, permanence of properties over time (aging stability), and versatility of adhesion levels, to name just a few of their benefits.<br>

Examples Multilayer Film Preparation<br>
A multilayer film containing about 446 layers was made on a sequential flat-film making line via a coextrusion process. This multilayer polymer film was made from coPEN and PETG (available from Eastman Chemicals). The coPFN was polymerized with 90% PEN and 10% PET starting monomers. A feedblock method (such as that described by U.S. patent 3,801,429) was used to generate about 223 optical layers with an approximately linear layer thickness gradient from layer to layer through the extrudate.<br>
The coPEN was delivered to the feedblock by an extruder at a rate of about 132 lb/hr and the PETG at about 160 lb/hr. A portion of the PETG is used as protective boundary layers (PBL's) on each side of the extrudate with about 32 lb/hr flow total. The material stream then passed though an asymmetric two times multiplier with a multiplier design ratio of about 1.25. Multiplier concepts and function are described in U.S. Patents 5,094,788 and 5,094,793. The multiplier ratio is defined as the average layer thickness of layers produced in the major conduit divided by the average layer thickness of layers in the minor conduit. This multiplier ratio was chosen so as to provide a small overlap of the two reflectance bands created by the two sets of 223 layers. Each set of 223 layers has the approximate layer thickness profile created by the feedblock, with overall thickness scale factors determined by the multiplier and film extrusion rates. After the multiplier, skin layers were added at about 72 lbs/hour (total) that was fed from a third extruder. Then the material stream passed through a film die and onto a water cooled casting wheel.<br>
The PETG melt process equipment was maintained at about 500° F, the coPEN (both optics and skin layers) melt process equipment was maintained at about 525° F, and the feedblock, multiplier, skin-layer meltstream, and die were maintained at about 525° F, The feedblock used to make the film for this example was designed to give a linear layer thickness distribution with a 1.3:1 ratio of thickest to thinnest layers under isothermal conditions. Errors in this layer profile are corrected with the axial rod heater profile, as described in US 6,827,886, which is incorporated by reference herein. The casting wheel speed was adjusted for precise control of final film thickness, and therefore, final bandedge position.<br><br>
The inlet water temperature on the casting wheel was about 7 °CeIsius. A high voltage pinning system was used to pin the extrudate to the casting wheel. The pinning wire was about 0.17 mm thick and a voltage of about 6.5 kV was applied. The pinning wire was positioned manually by an operator about 3 to 5 mm from the web at the point of contact to the casting wheel to obtain a smooth appearance to the cast web. The cast web was continuously oriented by conventional sequential length orienter (LO) and tenter equipment. The web was length oriented to a draw ratio of about 3.8 at about 270 °F. The film was preheated to about 255 °F in about 15 seconds in the tenter and drawn in the transverse direction to a draw ratio of about 3.5 at 270 °F. The film was heat set in the tenter oven at a temperature of about 460 °F for about 30 seconds. The finished film had a final thickness of about 0.0035 inches.<br>
Example 1<br>
An ultrafine dispersion of Antimony doped Indium Tin Oxide (A-ITO) particles in Methyl Cellosolve available from Advanced Nano Products Ltd., South Korea under the designation TRB Paste SM6080 was mixed with Methyl Ethyl Ketone to reduce the solid content in the dispersion from 60 to 45%. This solution was coated on the multilayer film described above using an extrusion die coating process. For a complete description of the die coating technique see "Modern Coating and Drying Technology," Eds. E. D. Cohen, E. B. Gutoff, VCH Publishers, NY, 1992). The extrudate flow rate was set at 330 g/min. (measured using a Micromotion™ flow meter, Micro Motion Inc., Boulder, CO, USA), the web speed at 50 feet per minute and the coated width at 42 inches. The coating was dried to remove solvent from the dispersion at 93 degrees Celsius and cured using a Fusion UV lamp system fitted with type D lamp operating at 80% power setting. This process resulted in the cured coating having a coating weight of approx. 0.7 g/ft . The having dried and cured A-ITO was further with a pressure sensitive adhesive on the surface opposite to the A-ITO and a silicone coated release liner (available from CP Films, Martinsville, VA, USA) laminated to it. The release liner was removed and the optical transmission and reflection spectra measured using a Lambda 19 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). The spectra were imported into Optics5 and Window 5.2 programs available from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories for analyzing thermal<br><br>
and optical properties of glazing systems. The programs can be downloaded from http://windows.lbl.gov/software/, The reflection and transmission spectra of the coated film are shown in Fig. la. The characteristics of a glazing system prepared by laminating the above described film to a 3 mm clear glass (PPG clear glass, NFRC ID: 5009) with the adhesive side towards the light source (sun) is shown in Table 1. The transmission and reflection spectra after lamination to the 3 mm glass substrate are shown in Figures lb and lc. The same film was laminated with the A-ITO surface towards the sun and the glazing system recalculated using the same software. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

The coating was in-line dried at 95°C and UV-cured at 6.1 m/min using a Fusion Systems 6000 (600 W/in) W curing system fitted with D-bulb. The dried coating had a thickness of<br><br>
approximately 3.6 micrometer. The optical transmission and reflection spectra of this film measured as in example 1 are shown in Figure 3. The glazing system prepared by laminating this film to a 6 mm PPG clear glass is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
The TRB paste SL6060 was coated on multilayer film, described above, using a meyer bar coating technique using Meyer bar #5(example 4a), #8 (example 4b) and #14 (example 4c.) The coatings were dried in an oven at 93°C for 10 min and cured under Fusion UV lamps (300W/in at 20 fpm) and optical transmission spectra of the samples measured. The spectra were imported into Optics5 and Window 5.2. The optical and thermal characteristics of glazing systems prepared with 3 mm clear glass are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
A dispersion of Antimony Tin Oxide (Inframat Advanced Materials LLC, CT product desgination 50N-5190-2) in a multi-functional acrylate monomer mixture was prepared by milling together 30 g. of ATO, 7.5 g. of penta aerithritol tetra acrylate (Sartomer Company., PA, product designation SR295 and 7.5 g. of 1,6-hexanedio diacrylate (Sartomer Company, PA, product designation SR238) and l-methoxy-2-propanol. 0.15 g each of photo initiators Irgacure 819 and Irgacure 184 (both from CIBA<br><br>
Specialty Chemicals, Basel, Switzerland) were added to the above dispersion and coated on the multilayer polymer film described above. The coating process was conducted as described in Example 1. The coating was cured and the resulting cured coating was tested in a Taber abrader according to ASTM D 1044-99 under a load of 500g and 50 cycles. This resulted in a haze of less than 4% measured with Haze-Gard Plus (BYK- Gardner, MD) haze meter.<br>
