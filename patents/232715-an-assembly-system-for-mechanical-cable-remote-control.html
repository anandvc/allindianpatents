				<td>ADJUSTMENT AND ASSEMBLY SYSTEM FOR MECHANICAL CABLE REMOTE CONTROL<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The object of this invention is related to an adjustment and assembly system for mechanical cable remote control where the transmission of movements and of the control forces between the transmitter mechanical element and the receiver mechanical element is made through transmission cable; and specifically a system in which the adjustment and assembly are made simultaneously by a dented pin at one end of the cable, which fits in a corresponding dented profile made in the inner edges of an oblong hole located at the end of one of the mechanical elements connected by the cable, in such a way that the pin positions itself in the best position in respect to the oblong hole, facilitating the assembly.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As it is perfectly known, when a control movement has to be transmitted with a given force between the mechanical elements which are separated or apart from one another, a flexible cable is normally used in the art which allows the precise transmission of movements and of control forces, even in sinuous routes.<br>
We frequently find in the mechanical industry examples of utilization of remote control cables for the<br><br>
transmission of data, especially in the cases in which we intend to reduce at the minimum the vibration transmissions through the cable. In the automotive industry, it is traditional to use cables to transmit to the engine the control of pedals of the accelerator and the clutch and to transmit the control of gear level to the gear box, when these two elements are separated from one another, what happens when the motor is placed transversally to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.<br>
A transmission cable of the push-pull type which allows the transmission of reciprocal movements in two directions is constituted by a flexible internal cable, of special manufacture, which allows the transmission of traction and compression forces, and a flexible outside shield or sheath in which the cable slides with minimum play. The constant linear dimension of the two elements along the axis of the cable determine the precision of movement transmission.<br>
Normally the two ends of the inner cable have terminals which allow its articulated connection to the movement transmitter and to the movement receiver element, and the two ends of the external cover have means to fix them to the supports of the respective elements.<br>
Due to the structure and under the action of stresses and the wear of the materials caused by variation of temperature, the inner cable and the outer sheath are subject to small plastic deformations which change the length of the elements. In addition, the relative distance between the mechanical elements connected by the cable is subject to effects of tolerances of the whole set of components and supports existing between the elements, and may not be previously and precisely determined.<br><br>
The effects of the above mentioned factors create the need of a system which allows the regulation of the cable length upon the assembly and during the whole useful life thereof, in order to compensate the variations of length during the use.<br>
For such purposes, transmission cables with adjustable length are used, the adjustment system of which are usually constituted by a male and female thread system, with tightening lock nuts located in the terminal ends of the cable. The regulation is made by tightening and loosening the thread at the terminal of the cable, and fixing the position so adjusted tightening the lock nut.<br>
Besides the fact that such adjustable elements are more expensive, this type of adjustment offers difficulties, for it has to be made frequently in a place of difficult access. At this time, the adjustment of the nut, specially the tightening of the lock nut, requires the use of two tools, and the access of the operator hands is limited within the existing space, which makes such adjustment quite complex, time consuming and imprecise.<br>
The operation safety is quite difficult to determine, due to the difficulty of reaching the right tightening torque of the lock nut.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Therefore, there is the need for a system to adjust the length of the cables and to connect them to the respective mechanical elements in a fast and sure way, which offers also a guaranty against the possibility of losing the connections.<br><br>
The solution submitted herein is a system in which the adjustment is made by a dented pin mounted at the end of the cable, which fits in the corresponding dented profile made in the internal edges of an oblong hole located in the end of one of the mechanical elements connected by the cable.<br>
Upon the assembly of the control transmitting mechanical element and of the corresponding receiving mechanical element, with the transmission cable already installed and connected to one of the elements, the dented pin attached to the free end of the cable is automatically close to the dented oblong hole of the mechanical element in which the pin is to be assembled, in a position which, due to the hole size, is always in along the length of the dented portion of the oblong hole. This position represents a natural position of adjustment naturally undertaken by the materials when there are not strains.<br>
In this condition, it is quite easy for the operator to fit, with one single hand, the dented pin within the oblong hole of the element to be connected, therefore remaining always in the correct adjusting position between the mechanical elements. The tightening of the nut which fixes the dented pin within the element is also facilitated, for since the dented pin fits within the dented portion of the oblong hole, the pin may not turn and, therefore, the tightening operation of the nut requires the use of a single tool, and may be performed by a single hand.<br>
In summary, the main advantages of the system of this invention are as follows:<br>
it allows the adjustment and assembly of the system using one single hand and one single tool;<br><br>
the adjustment may be made fast for, once the mechanical elements to be connected are located, it is only necessary to fit the pin in the dented hole;<br>
it is always possible to see that the pitch of the dent in the pin and in the oblong hole is less than the acceptable positioning error; and<br>
the use of this system does not exclude the possibility of also inserting an adjustment system, where necessary.<br>
The advantages of the system with respect to the prior one, namely, the usual system of adjustment with threads, are quite evident.<br>
The adjustment becomes automatic and simultaneous to the assembly. The fitting of the dents or teeth eliminates the possibility of the slackening, and the consequent plays and loss of adjustment, which is a natural fact with the threaded adjustment when subject to vibration. The tightening of the nut of the dented pin requires a single wrench, and the torque is quite easily controlled by the operator, who uses one single hand to assemble and to tighten the nut.<br>
Besides the above mentioned advantages, this invention allows the use of simple cables, without the threaded adjustment system. The simple cables are more compact and quite economical. On the other hand, the increase in cost of the pin and of the hole due to the dented profile is insignificant.<br><br>
The result is a greater simplicity, speed and safety in the assembly and adjusting operations of the system, with the consequent reduction of cost. One of the best practical results is that the system allows the adjustment in tight places with more safety than prior.<br>

assembly elements which are characteristics of this invention; and<br>
Fig. 6 is the view of the end of a receiving element, as per view VI-VI of Figure 5, showing in details the dented oblong hole which is one of the characteristic parts of this invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In a more specific reference to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows how a turning movement of control 1 of the transmitting mechanical element 2 may be transmitted through the transmission cable set 3 to the receiving mechanical element 4, therefore causing the rotation 5 thereof.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 1, the transmitting mechanical element 2 is an arm connected to an axis 6 and the receiving mechanical element 4 is an arm bent as an angle piece connected to the axis 7. We should note that the rotation plans of elements 2 and 4 may have different positions in the space, and not only the one represented in Figs. 1 and 3.<br>
On the side of the angle piece, namely, at the upper end of the arm 4, a hole 19 receives the joint pin 8 which has a threaded bar which enters the hole and which is fixed to the arm 4 through a nut 9.<br>
The transmission cable set 3 represented in Fig. 1 is of adjustable type and is constituted by an outside flexible cover of sheath 10, the ends of which are attached to the equipment through supports 11 and an inner flexible cable 12, in which ends are fixed the terminals 13 and 14 which move, respectively, in the ends of the transmitting element 2 and of the receiving element 4 of the control.<br><br>
In order to allow the adjustment of the length of the inner cable 12, one of the terminals, which in the this case is the terminal 14, has an adjustment system formed by a threaded rod 16 which is threaded in a threaded busing 17 attached to the end of the internal cable 12. A lock nut 18 is tightened in the end of the adjusting, against the threaded bushing 17 in order to fix the adjusted length.<br>
The freedom of rotation and oscillation of the two ends of the transmission cable 12 with respect to the transmitting element 2 to the receiving element 4 is assured by the joints of the terminals 13 and 14 which, in the shown configuration, are each constituted by a joint pin 8 with spherical head which is fixed to the respective element 2 or 4, and a spherical seat 15 which is an integral part of the respective terminal 13 or 14. We should also note that the joints could be different: such as, the joint 13 could be formed by a cylindrical pin.<br>
The adjustment of the system is performed by placing the transmitter element 2 and the receiving element 4 in the respective neutral positions, which in the case of Figs. 1 and 3 are the central positions shown in the elements, and adjusting the length of the cable 12. The adjustment is normally made by tightening or loosening the threaded rod 16 of the terminal 14 within the threaded bushing 17, fixed to the cable 12, until the threaded rod of the joint pin 8 enters loosely in the hole 19 opened in the end of element 4. The lock nut 18 is then tightened against the threaded busing 17 in order to fix the performed adjustment.<br>
Once the length of the inner cable 12 is adjusted, the pin 8 is fixed to the receiving arm element or element 4 introducing the threaded rod of the pin in the hole 19 and placing and tightening the nut<br><br>
9.<br>
It should be noted that the above mentioned adjustment requires a given time to adjust the length of the cable, and another time to tighten the lock nut 18 on the threaded bushing 17. The tightening requires two wrenches operated in opposite direction. The tightening of the nut 9 and the pin 8 requires also two opposite wrenches, since before the tightening, the pin rotates freely within the hole 19 and within the spherical seat 15. All adjusting operations described above require the action of both hands of the operator.<br>
The system of this invention, shown in Figs. 3 to 6, eliminates the problems of adjusting which exist in the assembly mentioned above. Fig. 3 shows the transmission cable 3' with the inner cable 12', which, at this time, is of the simple type, of fixed length. The transmitting element 2 and the terminal 13 with the joint do not change, but the receiving arm 4 and the pin 8 were priory replaced, respectively, by the new receiving element 4' and the new pin 20.<br>
In Figs. 3 and 4 the terminal 30 with the new pin 20 fitted therein are shown in the act of being assembled in the new receiving element or arm 4'. It is possible to notice that when the transmitting element 2 and the receiving element 4' are in their central or neutral positions, the cable 12', when free, places itself naturally with its pin 20 in any point 26 of the length of the oblong hole 25, which is in the place of the prior hole 19.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the new pin 20, plus the sphere 21 and the threaded portion 22 which are<br><br>
in the prior pin 8, has a knurled or dented portion 23, the teeth of which will fit in the corresponding knurl or dented portion 24 of the inner surface of the oblong hole 25, located at the end of the new receiving element 4'.<br>
The knurled or dented circular portion 23 of the new pin 20 may fit any point of the knurled or dented portion 24 of the oblong hole 25. In Fig. 6 there are, shown in dotted lines, the extreme positions 27 in which the pin 20 may be positioned and the distance between the two outside points 27 represents the useful length 28 of the knurled portion 24.<br>
The correct point of fit of pin 20 in the hole 25 will depend on the differences which are in each assembly, between the length of the transmission cable 3' and the corresponding distance for the assembly of the devices in which there are assembled, respectively, the transmitting element 2 and the receiving element 4' of the control. The useful length 28 of the knurled or dented portion 24 is dimensioned in order to be longer than most differences in length actually found.<br>
In the example shown in Figs. 3 and 4, upon the assembly, the first parts to be mounted are the devices which include, respectively, the transmitting 2 and the receiving element 4' with the transmission cable 3' already installed on the transmitting element 2, and the elements are then placed in the respective neutral positions. In this condition, the inner cable 12' will be naturally fitted in such a way that its terminal 30 is close to the end of the receiving arm 4'.<br>
The pin 20, already fitted into the terminal 30, will remain also close to the oblong hole 25, in a<br><br>
position and in a distance which corresponds to the neutral position of the receiving element 4', which allows the right fitting of the dents 23 and 24 already in the right adjusted position.<br>
It is therefore easy for the assembler to unite, directly, with one single hand, the terminal 30 of the inner cable 12' with the end of the arm or receiving element 4' in the correct adjusting position. With the dented pin 20 not turning, due to the fitting of the teeth, it is easy for the assembler to place the washer 32 and the tightening nut 33 in the threaded portion 22 of the dented pin 20, and to tighten the nut with a single wrench, using one single hand. This ease of handling simplifies the service in places which are tight and of difficult access.<br>
The safety of the system herein submitted is assured by the fact that, due to the fitting of the teeth, there is no possibility of losing and loss of regulation of the length of cable, a fact which is present when we use the traditional adjustment by thread.<br>
The adjusting system of this invention allows the use of transmission cables with fixed length which are simpler and more economical and safe. Fig. 5 shows how the end of the internal cable 12' is fixed directly to the terminal 30. In the spherical joint shown in this example, the spherical seat 31, which fits the terminal 30, receives the spherical head 21 of the new dented pin 30.<br>
By the above, it becomes clear that the new characteristics submitted in this invention facilitate the assembly and regulation of the whole mechanical transmission of control through cables, specially in conditions of difficult access of the elements connected by the cable, offer more safety in the<br><br>
pperation of the control system, and allow a significant reduction in time and costs of labor and material.<br>
