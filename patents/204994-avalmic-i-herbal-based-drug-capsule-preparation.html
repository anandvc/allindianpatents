BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying figures are the patients suffering from HIV /AIDS and treated by the<br>
inventor.<br>
Duration	Dose<br>
Adults :	2-4 months or as required        200-Mg capsule-BD<br>
Children :	Age x 3 days	1/2 to 1 capsule- once or twice a day.<br>
Note: Absolute CD4 count increase<br>
Viral load (HIV-RNA-PCR-ULTRA-QUANT) decrease Patient No 1 : Male. Age-35 years:<br><br><br><br><br>
to cure human health disorders such as fflV/AIDS / Cancer The role of several medicinal plants is well documented.<br>
Attention is now directed to harness and harvest these natural sources to cure human health disorders. The present invention describes the method of use of therapeutic combination of plant material for the patients with dreaded diseases HIV/AIDS /Cancer and to develop immunity in the body system.<br>
Earlier studies carried out by this inventor during 1991 -1993 on patients infected by HIV / AIDS /Cancer provided important leads. The inventor in association with the hospitals namely King George Hospital- Vishakhapatnam. and Kakinada General Hospital, Andhra Pradesh, India conducted studies on HIV / AIDS/Cancer patients The medicine as absence of contra indication.<br>
The studijBS of the inventor helped the treatment of the patients to control * to bring normalcy   to achieve negativity     (Viral load zero) and to cure dreaded diseases.<br>
This invention thus deals with the use of medicinal plants namely Piper nigrum. Allium cepa , Pongamia pinnata, Cicer -arietinum, Plantago ovata, Acacia arebica, and Cassia auriculata for preparing medicines for the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS.<br>
All organs function properly<br>
"   Viral load (HIV-RNA-PCR-ULTRA-QUANT) In- range 
"*"   Elisa / Tri dot test, Western Blot test HIV-J, II all bands , Viral load (111V-RNA-PCR-ULTRA-QUANT) test - Undetected or Negative,<br>
The novelty of these medicines are all the ingredients will be mixed ,dried and bum uniformly in a clay pot covered by mud and sand to carbon form(not ash) when the mixture is burnt to carbon , chemical action will be taken place. Carbon is a source for coal tar from which sulphur drugs are derived. Normally no ayurveda doctor will do this type burning. So when all the ingredients mixture in a paste form put to bum chemical reaction takes place, there the formation of the above mixture will help in reducing the virus of the patient.<br>
The drugs kill HTV virus and repair the mucus membranes destroyed by vims and help the organs function normally, thereby immunity develops and the dmgs will allow vims<br>
Page 10 of 20<br><br>
to go further and continuously keep on destroy the virus. The drug purity and restore blood and regulates brain and nervous system. This is novehy of these drugs.<br>
Ayurvede lays importance on the holistic approach both in the attempt to understand the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases. Ayurveda considers Cancer of any kind in Any particular place or organ only as accumulation or epithelial cell or tissues as the Case may be in any area that becomes vulnerable to it due to the disturbed normalcy Of immune system. Therefore, ayurveda takes into consideration the INTERNAL milieu Of body and recommends treatment for the whole system and the local condition concurrently. In Ayurveda carcinoma and sarcoma are described Arbuda or valmeeka.<br>
Oncology is the study of tumors. Neoplasia means abnormal new growth, which May be benign or malignant. Benign tumors represent the accumulations of cells which Have been transformed to reproduce in abnormal numbers but under circumstances Where they remain with in the tissue of origin. Malignant tumors are comprised of Cells, which are capable of invading adjacent tissues and leaving the tissue of origin To disseminate and form metastases.<br>
This present invention boosts the vitality (immunity) of the individual body And thus promotes and maintains the immune mechanism at the optimum level. Even Modem science points out that it can be immune stimulant, raising the body s own Defense mechanism. More particularly this invention is an ideal therapy in all Immunological disorders including cancer, HIV/AIDS and degenerative changes of Tissues anywhere in the body<br>
This is a specially invented process through "Anubhuta" yoga" for preparing a Herbal based drug capsule with a unique combination of natural ingredients a which Enhances the natural immunity of the body it promotes and maintains the immune Mechanism. So this invention of the herbal is base is the drug of choice for HIV/ AIDS And early malignancies such as carcinoma, leukemia and early secondaries .<br>
The primary objective of the invention was to invent a navel herbal drug For treatment of HIV/ AIDS<br>
The other objective of the invention was to invent a herbal based drug with Would provide an effective drug therapy.<br>
Another objective of the invention was to invent a process for manufactunng Herbal based drug.<br>
Another objective of the invention was to invent a novel herbal based drug Which is available at the affordable cost and does not have side effects and has long self-life.<br>
Further objectives of the invention will be clear from the following description:<br>
Now the invention will be described in the following description in detail. The characteristic of the raw material and the proportion in which they are used in preparing<br>
