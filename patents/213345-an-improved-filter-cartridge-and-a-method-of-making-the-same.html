Background of the Invention<br>
Technical Field	<br>
5	The present indention relates generally to a filter cartridge. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to a retention strap for the filter cartridge and method of manufacturing the filter<br>
cartridge with the retention strap.<br>
Description of the Prilor Art<br>
Filter cartridges that have pleated filtration media for filtering particulates from a particulate<br>
10      laden fluid stream moving in one direction through the filter cartridge are known. Such a filter<br>
cartridge is often subjected to cleaning fluid pulses moving for short periods of time through the<br>
filtration  media in aditection opposite to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves.<br>
Such a filter cartridge is  referred to as a "pulse pleat" filter cartridge. Known retention straps encircle<br>
portions of the pulse p|eat filter cartridge to prevent the filtration media from excessive movement<br>
15      during exposure to the) cleaning fluid pulses.<br>
However, the known-retention straps for pulse pleat filter cartridges have drawbacks because<br>
they are difficult to install onto a filter cartridge and may not remain in the relative axial location they<br>
are initially placed in. for example, a known textile retention strap must be manually wrapped about<br>
the filtration media of the filter cartridge. The textile retention strap is typically tightened manually<br>
20      and the ends of the retention strap are overlapped. The ends of the retention strap are then adhered or<br>
fastened together while  a desired tension is manually maintained on the retention strap.<br><br>
WO 02/47789	PCT/US01/48709<br>
It is important that the retention strap remain in a desired relative axial location along the filter cartridge to assure that the strap properly protect the filtration media from excessive movement during exposure to the cleaning fluid pulses. This is typically accomplished by the use of an adhesive. However, such jan adhesive axial location device has been known to fair and the strap may 5      become incorrectly positioned axially along the filter cartridge.<br>

.  Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention is embodied in a filter cartridge 20 (Figs, 1 and 2) for removing<br>
particulates from a particulate laden fluid stream moving one direction through the filter cartridge.<br>
The filter cartridge 20 is particularly suitable for use in air pollution control applications. The filter<br><br>
cartridge 20 is a "pulse ple,at" type of filter cartridge that is periodically subject to pulsed cleaning<br>
fluid moving in an opposite direction to the direction that the particulate laden fluid stream moves, as<br>
is known. Such a filter cartridge 20 may be subjected to over 300,000 cleaning pulses per year over a<br>
typical expected service life of about two years. The filter cartridge 20 is operably attached to a tube<br>
sheet 22 (Fig. 2) in a plenum (not shown) of a known baghouse (not shown).<br>
The filter cartridg  20 includes filtration media 24 that is formed  into a generally tubular or<br>
cylindrical configuration, las illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3-4, with a longitudinal central axis A. The<br>
filtration media 24 has a plurality of pleats 26 which are circumferentially spaced about the<br>
circumference of the filter cartridge 20. Each pleat 26 has a tip 42 formed at its radially outermost<br>
location, as viewed in Figs, l.and 3-4, and a pair of sides 44 extending radially inward from the tip.<br>
The pleats 26 in the filtration media 24 are not necessarily stiff and strong, thus, the pleats are prone<br>
i<br>
to radially outward movement during a cleaning fluid pulse. Excessive radial outward movement of the filtration media 24 cah damage the filtration effectiveness of the filter cartridge 20. Adjacent pleats 26 may also "collapse" and temporarily engage one another during a cleaning pulse or during a<br><br>
WO 02/47789<br><br>
PCT/US01/48709<br><br>
filtration cycle. When<br>
adjacent pleats 26 engage one another, there is a chance that the cleaning pulse<br>
or filtration operation "will not he as effective as it should be because gas flow through that portion of the filtration media 24 can be temporarily blocked. Thus, it is desirable to prevent excessive radial movement of the filtration media 24 and collapse of the pleats 26.<br>
Mounting structure 62 (Figs. 1-2) is located at a first axial end portion of the filtration media<br>
24 and Filter cartridge pp. The mounting structure 62 is made of. an elastomeric material for mounting<br>
and sealing the filter cartridge 20 in an opening 64 (Fig. 2) in the tube sheet 22. A known suitable<br>
material for the mounting structure 62 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. An end cap 66 is located at anj axially.opposite second axial end portion of the filtration media 24 and filter cartridge 20. The end cap 66 is preferably made from a molded urethane material. The filtration media 24 is potted and maintained in the generally tubular configuration by the mounting structure 62 and the end cap 66. A permeable support 68 is located radially inward of the filtration media 24 to prevent inward collapse of the filtration media 24 during exposure to the particulate laden fluid stream that is to be filtered.<br>
•    The filter cartridge 20 also includes a retention device in the form of a plurality of retention straps 82, constructed according the present invention. The retention straps 82 limit radial movement of the filtration media 24 in the radially outward direction, opposite to the flow of the fluid stream to be filtered, when subjected to the periodical cleaning fluid. The retention straps 82 also serve to space apart and maintain adjacent pleats 42 spaced apart around the circumference of the filter cartridge 20.<br>
Each retention strap 82 embodying the present invention is preferably made from a thermoplastic elastomeric material having sufficient strength and fatigue resistance to prevent excessive radial mo ement of the filtration media 24 during a cleaning pulse and maintain the pleats<br><br>
26 spaced apart. The pretention strap 82 is also capable of withstanding the elevated operating<br>
i	"<br>
temperatures and operating environment, such as exposure to moisture and chemical degradation, that the filter cartridge 20 is typically exposed to and designed for. The retention strap 82 can be made<br><br>
WO 02/47789	<br>
PCTAJS01/48709<br>
from any suitable material Particularly suitable materials have been found to be Hytrel® 5556 or<br>
8238 thermoplastic polyester elastomer available from DuPont.	"<br>
The material of the retention strap 82 is selected for its strength and impact resistance at the relatively elevated operating temperatures that the retention strap will be exposed to. The material of 5      the retention strap .82 is also selected for its resistance to chemical and moistuVe degradation of its strength and impact resistance. The preferred thermoplastic polyester elastomer meets these design parameters. Incomplete testing has shown that the strap can withstand over 150,000 cleaning pulses<br><br>
and function while constantly exposed to at least 265oF, and in some case"s 350°F, without losing its<br>
strength and without moving axially along the filter cartridge from the position it was initially placed<br>
10      in,	<br>
The retention strap 82 engages and is adhered to at least some tip1 s 42 and perhaps some of<br>
the sides 44 of pleats 26 of the filtration media 24, as illustrated in Fig. 3" The engagement minimizes<br>
radially outward movement of the tips 42 of the pleats 26 and that the pleats are maintained spaced<br>
apart without collapsing against one another during exposure to the pressure and flow of the cleaning<br>
15      fluid or the particulate ladj^n air. The adherence assures that the retention strap 82 remains in the<br>
relative axial location it was originally placed in throughout its service life.<br>
I<br>
The retention stra|p 82 is preferably applied to the filter cartridge during an extrusion operation. The retention strap 82 is adhered to the filtration media 24 during the extrusion operation so it does not move alongj the filter cartridge in a direction parallel to the axis A. During the extrusion 20      operation, the retention strap 82 has portions 84 (Fig. 3) which are forceld to extend at least partially<br>
into the region between adjacent pleats 26. This assures that there is some structure located between<br>
i	,	■    ■<br>
the pleats 26 that prevent) adjacent pleats from engaging each other. Th"e retention strap 82 is also<br><br>
forced to engage and adhere to tips 42 and/or sides 44 of the pleats 26 to assure that "the retention<br>
strap remains in the axial position it was originally applied to the filter cartridge 20. Once the 25       material of the retention strap 82 "cures", it has a hardness and strength sufficient to withstand the operating environment it  will be exposed to for its service life and adheres to the filtration media 24.<br><br>
WO 02/47789<br><br>
7<br><br>
PCT/US01/48709<br><br>
The retention strap 82 according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention further includes reinforcement structure 86 (Fig. 4), The reinforcement structure 86 may be any suitable material but is contemplated to be textile reinforcement. The reinforcement structure 86 is introduced during the extrusion operation. The reinforcement structure 86 may be introduced during a single 5      extrusion pass and forced into the extrudate or introduced between two separate extrusion passes. The present invention is also directed to a method of making a filter cartridge 20 with the<br>
retention strap 82, as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. The method includes an extruder 102, a pivotable<br>
application roller 104, a cutoff mechanism 106 and an optional reinforcement applicator (not shown).<br>
The method of the present invention is described below.<br>
10	A filter cartridge 20 without any retention device is held in proximity to the extruder 102 by a<br>
support mechanism 122 The support mechanism 122 is adapted to hold and rotate the filter cartridge<br>
20 during the applicant of an extruded retention strap 82. The support mechanism 122 includes a<br>
mounting structure holder 124 and an end cap holder 126. The mounting structure holder 124 closely<br>
fits within and supportslthe mounting structure 62 of the filter cartridge 20. The end cap holder 126<br>
15      supports the end cap 66 of the filter cartridge 20. The support mechanism 122 positions the filter<br>
  cartridge 20 so the longitudinal central axis A of the filter cartridge extends in a direction normal to a<br>
barrel 142 of the extruder 102. Either or both of the holders 124 or 126 are operably connected with a<br>
drive mechanism (not, shown) to rotate the supported filter cartridge 20 under the barrel 142 of the   •<br>
extruder 102, in a clockwise direction as illustrated by the arrow R in Fig. 5.<br>
20	The filter cartridge 20 is rotated under the barrel 142 of the extruder 102 while a band of<br>
extrudate 144 is applied to the outer surface the filter cartridge 20. The application roller 104 is<br>
loaded to a predetermined force so the portions 84 of the uncured extrudate 144 is forced to deform in<br><br>
between adjacent pleats 26 of the filtration media 24. The application roller 104 also forces the<br>
extrudate 144 to contact tips 42 and sides 44 of pleats 26 to engage and adhere the retention strap 82<br>
25       to the filtration media 24. The extrudate 144 then is allowed to cure to form the retention strap S2.<br><br>
WO 02/47789<br><br>
8<br><br>
PCT/US01/48709<br><br>
In an alternate embodiment, reinforcement structure 84 may be introduced into the retention<br>
i	!<br>
strap 82. Textile reinforcement 84 is paid off the optional reinforcement  applicator. The textile<br>
reinforcement 84 is introduced into"the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 forces the textile<br>
!	■	!<br>
reinforcement 84 into the ejxtrudate 144. Optionally the textile reinforcement 84 could be placed<br><br>
between two separate layers of extrudate 144.<br>
When circumferentially opposite ends of the extrudate 144 overlap, the cutoff mechanism<br>
106 is activated to sever the extrudate 144. The application roller 104 then creates a unified one-<br>
	"<br>
piece retention strap 82 that  remains in its axial relative place and supports the pleats 26 and prevents<br>
engagement between adjacent pleats.<br>
