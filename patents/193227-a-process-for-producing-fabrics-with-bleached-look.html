FIELD OP INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for providing a bleached look in the colour density of the surface of dyed fabric, especially cellulosic fabric such as denim.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The most usual method of providing a bleached stone-washed look in denim fabric or jeans is by washing the denim or jeans made from such fabric in the presence of pumice stones to provide the desired localized lightening of the colour of the fabric. This is then followed by a bleaching process where the fabric is treated with sodium hypochlorite at 60°C and pH 11-12 for up to 20 min., followed by a neutralisation step and a rinsing. Use of hypochlorite is undesirable, both because chlorite itself is undesirable and because the neutralisation subsequently generates high amounts of salts leading to disposal and pollution problems.<br>
Bleaching enzymes such as peroxidases together with hydrogen peroxide or oxidases together with oxygen have also been suggested for bleaching of dyed textiles (see WO 92/18683), either alone or together with a phenol such as p-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenol, p-hydroxybenzene sulphonate, vanillin or p-hydroxybenzoic acid. The disclosed process is not efficient as can be seen from Example 1 of the i present invention.<br>
Thus there is still a need for providing a bleached look in dyed fabrics. The problem to be solved is not easy as many VAT-dyes, especially indigo, are not soluble in water and have a very compact structure on the fibre surface, making them difficult for an enzyme to attack.<br><br>
SUMMASY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that it is possible to create a very efficient process for providing a bleached look in the colour density of the surface of dyed fabric, the process comprising contacting, in an aqueous medium, a dyed fabric with a phenol oxidizing enzyme system and an enhancing agent of the following formula:<br><br>
in which formula X represents (-0-) or (-S-), and the substituent groups R1-R9, which may be identical or different, independently represents any of the following radicals: hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, formyl, carboxy, and esters and salts hereof, carbamoyl, sulfo, and esters and salts hereof, sulfamoyl, nitro, amino, phenyl, C^-C^-alkyl, C^-Cj-alkoxy,-carbonyl-C^-Cj-alkyl, aryl-C^-Cj-alkyl; which carbamoyl, sulfamoyl, and amino groups may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted once or twice with a substituent group R10; and which phenyl may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituent groups R10; and which C1-Cu-alkyl, C^-Cg-alkoxy, carbonyl-C^-Cj-alkyl, and aryl-C^Cj-alkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched, and may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituent groups R10;<br>
which substituent group R10 represents any of the following radicals: halogen, hydroxy, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts hereof, carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts hereof, sulfamoyl, nitro, amino, phenyl, aminoalkyl, piperidino, piperazinyl, pyrrolidin-1-yl, C^-Cj-alkyl, C^-Cj-alkoxy; which carbamoyl., sulfamoyl, and amino groups may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted once or twice with hydroxy, C^-Cj-alkyl, C^-Cj-alkoxy; and which phenyl may further-<br><br>
more be substituted with one or more of the following radicals: halogen, hydroxy, amino, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts hereof, carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts hereof, and sulfamoyl; and which C^-Cj-alkyl, and C^-Cj-alkoxy groups may furthermore be saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched, and may furthermore be substituted once or twice with any of the following radicals: halogen, hydroxy, amino, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts hereof, carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts hereof, and sulfamoyl;<br>
or in which general formula two of the substituent groups R1-R9 may together form a group -B-, in which B represents any of the following the groups: (-CHR10-N=N-), (-CH=CH-)n, (-CH=N-)n or (-N=CR10-NR11-) , in which groups n represents an integer of from 1 to 3, R10 is a substituent group as defined above and R11 is defined as R10.<br>

Industrial Applications<br>
The process of the present invention is typically used in industrial machines for making fabric look bleached. Normally, the process of the invention will be performed on fabric already stonewashed, but the process may also be applied to fabric which has not undergone a stonewashing process beforehand. Most commonly the fabric is added to the machine according to the machine capacity per the manufacturer's instructions. The fabric may be added to the machine prior to introducing water or the fabric may be added after water is introduced. The phenol oxidizing enzyme system and the enhancing agent of the invention may be present in the water prior to adding the fabric or they may be added after the fabric has been wetted. The phenol oxidizing enzyme system may be added simultaneously with the enhancing agent or they may be added separately. After the fabric has been contacted with the phenol oxidizing enzyme system and the enhancing agent of the invention it should be agitated in the machine—for a sufficient period of time to ensure that the fabric is fully wetted and to ensure the action of the enzyme system and the enhancing agent.<br><br>
We have found (see the examples below) that the optimum bleaching conditions might be a compromise between optimum stability of the enzymes, optimum activity of the enzyme, optimum stability of the radical of the enhancing agent, and optimum reactivity (oxidation potential) of the radical, as well as choice of buffering system (buffer capacity, buffer toxicity, costs of buffer etc.).<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing fabrics with bleached look in the colour density of dyes on the surface thereof said process comprising the steps of contacting in an aqueous medium, a dyed fabric with a phenol oxidizing enzyme system such as herein described and an enhancing agent of the following formula:<br><br>
in which formula X represents (-0-) or (-S-), and the substituent groups R1-R9, which may be identical or different, independently represents any of the following radicals; hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, formyl, carboxy, and esters and salts thereof carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts thereo£sulfamoyl, nitro, amino, phenyl, CrCi4-alkyl, Ci-C5-alkoxy, carbonyl-CrC5-alkyl, aryl -CrC5-alkyL; which carbamoyl, sulfamoyl and amino, groups may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted once or twice with a substitutent group R10; which phenyl may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted or substituted with one or more substituent groups R10; and which Cl-Ci4-alkyl, Cx-Cs-alkoxy, carbonyl-Ci-C5 alkyl, and aryl-Ci-C5<br><br>
alkyl groups are preferably saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched, and may furthermore be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituent groups R10; which substituent group R10 represents any of the following radicals: halogen, hydroxy, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts thereof carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts thereof sulfamoyl, nitro, amino, phenyl, aminoalkyl, piperidino, piperazinyl, pyrrolidino, CrC5-alkyl, CrC5-alkoxy; which carbamoyl, sulfamoyl, and amino groups may furthermore be unbstituted or substituted once or twice with hydroxy, CrC5-alkyl, CrC5-alkoxy; and which phenyl may furthermore be substituted with one or more of the following radicals; halogen, hydroxy, amino, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts thereof carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts thereof, and sulfamoyl; and which CiC5-alkyl, and CrCs-alkoxy groups may further more be saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched, any may furthermore be substituted once or twice with any of the following radicals; halogen, hydroxy, amino, formyl, carboxy and esters and salts hereof, carbamoyl, sulfo and esters and salts thereof, and sulfamoyl; or in which general formula two of the substituent groups R^R9 may together form a group -B-, in which B represents any of the following the groups: (-CHR10" N=N-), (-CH-CH-X or (-N=CR10-NR1!-), in which groups n represents an integer of from 1 to 3, R10 is a substituent group as defined above and R11 is defined as R10, to obtain a bleached fabric.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example, in which;<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Bleaching Denim with Laccase and Different Enhancing Agents<br>
The test procedure for denim bleaching was performed as described below:<br>
Enhancing agents: The enhancing agents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Janssen Chimica, Kodak, Tokyo Kasai Organic Chemicals, Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. or Boehringer Mannheim; N-methylated derivatives of phenothiazine and phenoxazine may be prepared by methylation with methyliodide as described by Cornel Bodea and loan Silberg in "Recent Advances in the Chemistry of Phenothiazines" (Advances in heterocyclic chemistry, 1968, Vol. 9, pp. 321-460); B. Cardillo &amp; G. Casnati in Tetrahedron, 1967, Vol. 23, p. 3771. Phenothiazine and phenoxazine propionic acids may be prepared as described xn J. Org. Chem. 15, 1950, pp. 1125-1130. Hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl derivatives of phenothiazine and phenoxazine may be prepared as described by G. Cauquil in Bulletin de la Society Chemicrue de France. 1960, p.1049.<br>
Enzyme:  Laccase derived from Trametes villosa  (SP 504, available from Novo Nordisk A/S) was used.<br>
Procedure: 18 ml 0.01 M B&amp;R (Britt &amp; Robinson) buffer (pH 4, 6, or 8) were added to a 50 ml conical flask. A magnet bar (4 cm)<br><br>
and a circular piece of stone washed denim (3.5 cm diameter 0.4 g) were added to the flask together with 1 ml of the stock solution of the enhancing agent to be tested and 1 ml of enzyme, giving a denim:liquor (w/w) ratio of 1:50; the final concentrations of the enhancing agent and the enzyme shown in Table 1-2 below.<br>
The flask was incubated for 2-3 hours on a magnet stirrer in a water bath  (50°C and approximately 200 rpm).  After the<br>
i<br>
enzymatic bleaching, the denim swatch was rinsed with distilled i water and air dried, whereafter it was evaluated for the degree of bleaching. The evaluation was performed visually and by using a Minolta Chroma Meter CR2 00 or a Minolta Chroma Meter CR300.<br>
Evaluation: A Minolta Chroma Meter CR200 or CR300 (available from Minolta Corp.) was used according to Manufacturer's instructions to evaluate the degree of bleaching as well as to estimate any discoloration using the change in the colour space coordinates L*a*b* (CIELAB-system) : L* gives the change in white/black at a scale of from 0 to 100, a* gives the change in green (-a*)/red (+a*) , and b* gives the change in blue (-b*)/yellow (+b*) . A decrease in L* means an increase in black colour (decrease of white colour) , an increase in L* means an increase in white colour (a decrease in black colour), a decrease in a* means an increase in green colour (decrease in red colour) , an increase in a* means an increase in red colour (a decrease in green colour), a decrease in b* means an increase in blue colour (a decrease in yellow colour), and an increase in b* means an increase in yellow colour (a decrease in blue colour) .<br>
The bleached stone washed denim swatches were compared to non-treated stone washed denim swatches.<br>
The Minolta Chroma Meter CR200 or the Minolta Chroma Meter CR300 was operated in the L*a*b* colour space (coordinate system) . The light source used was a CIE light standard C. Each measurement was an average of 3 measurements. The instrument was calibrated using a Minolta calibration plate (white). 10 non-treated denim swatches were measured 2 times each and the<br><br>
average of the coordinates L*a*b* were calculated and entered as a reference. The coordinates of the samples were then calculated as the difference (A) of the average of 3 measurements on each swatch from the reference value of the coordinates L*a*b*.<br>

Table 1 shows A (L*/a*/k&gt;*) between a swatch treated with<br>
« the tested system and a non-treated swatch at pH 4, 6 and 8.<br><br><br><br>
Visually a AL* around 5 gives a significant effect so it can be seen from the results presented in Table 1 that all the tested systems have a significant effect at pH 4-6 in bleaching denim.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Bleaching Denim with Laccase and Phenothiazine-10-Propionic Acid using Different Buffers.<br>
To illustrate the effect of different buffers on the<br>
denim bleaching performance the following tests have been made:<br>
11 different buffers and 3 types of water were<br>
i tested. Each buffer was prepared at a concentration of 0.01 M,<br>
and pH adjusted to pH 6.5 with NaOH or with the corresponding<br>
acid. 80 ml of the buffer in question was added to a 200 ml<br>
glass beaker together with a magnet bar (4 cm) , and 8 circular<br>
pieces of denim (3.5 cm in diameter ~ 0.4 g) , giving a<br>
denim:liquor ratio of 1:25.<br>
The glass beaker was incubated on a magnet stirrer<br>
(3 00 rpm) in a water bath at 60 °C, and a pH electrode was<br>
dipped into the liquor in the middle of the beaker in order to<br>
monitor and control pH at pH 6.5 (i.e. the experiments were run<br>
under pH-stat conditions using a Radiometer pH-stat (PHM 82 or<br>
PHM 62 pH meter, TTT 80 Titrator, ABU 80 Autoburette) with<br>
automatic titration with the corresponding acid (0.1 M) if and<br>
when pH increased above pH 6.5). Following equilibration at pH<br>
6.5, phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT), 0.02 M in 96%<br>
ethanol, was added to a final concentration of 250 ixM<br>

(20 LACU/ml in water, available from Novo Nordisk A/S) to a<br>
final concentration of 0.1 LACU/ml " 39 iig/g.  After 30 minutes<br>
the denim swatches were rinsed in tap-water and air dried on<br>
filter paper overnight, and the resulting degree of bleaching<br>
was determined as mentioned above in Example 1. The results are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br><br>

The results obtained in Table 3 are in accordance with results obtained. determining PPT radical stability (T1/2) in various<br><br>
buffers at various pH following the general correlation: A high radical stability will give a high bleaching performance, and a low radical stability will give a low bleaching performance.<br>

The glass beaker was incubated on a magnet stirrer (3 00 rpm) in a water bath at 50°C, and a pH electrode was dipped into the liquor in the middle of the beaker in order to monitor and control pH at the desired pH in the range 4.0-7.5 (i.e. the experiments were run under pH-stat conditions using a Radiometer pH-stat (PHM 82 or PHM 62 pH meter, TTT 80 Titrator, ABU 80 Autoburette) with automatic titration with 0.1 M oxalic acid if and when pH increased above set-point).<br>
Following equilibration at the desired pH, phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT), 0.02 M in 96% ethanol, was added to a final concentration of 83.3 /uM ' 2.1 /xmole/g together with laccase from Trametes villosa (TvL) or .

circular pieces of denim (3.5 cm in diameter " 0.4 g), giving a denim:liquor ratio of 1:25. The glass beaker was incubated on a magnet stirrer (3 00 rpm) in a water bath at the appropriate temperature, and a pH electrode was dipped into the liquor in the middle of the beaker in order to monitor and control pH at the desired pH (i.e. the experiments were run under pH-stat conditions using a Radiometer pH-stat (PHM 8 2 or PHM 62 pH meter, TTT 80 Titrator, ABU 80 Autoburette) with automatic} titration with 0.1 M oxalic acid if and when pH increased above set-point). Following equilibration at the desired pH, phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT), 0.02 M in 96% ethanol, was added to a final concentration of 83.3 nM ' 2.1 /Ltmole/g together with laccase from Trametes villosa (TvL) or Myceliopthora thermophila (MtL); TvL available from Novo Nordisk A/S and MtL produced as described in PCT/US95/06815. After 10 and 20 minutes PPT was added corresponding to 83.3 /nM " 2.1 iimole/q, giving a total amount of PPT of 6.3 Mmole/g. After 3 0 minutes the denim swatches were rinsed in tap-water and air dried on filter paper overnight, and the resulting degree of bleaching was determined as mentioned above in Example 1.

It can be seen from Table 6 that when using the above described conditions both enzymes exhibit a typical enzyme dosage response profile, and that the enzyme dosage optimum of the denim bleaching process for the T. villosa laccase is around 0.5 LACU/ml ' 195 vg/q and the enzyme dosage optimum of the denim bleaching process for the M. thermophila laccase is around 0.1 LACU/ml ' 54 M/g«<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The Bleach Response as a Function of Time in the Denim Bleaching Process.<br>
To illustrate the bleach response as a function of time in the denim bleaching process, a time profile was made in the following way:<br>
Two different buffers were used (B&amp;R buffer and oxalate buffer). Each buffer was prepared at a concentration of 0.01 M, and pH adjusted to the appropriate pH with NaOH or with the corresponding acid. 20 ml of the buffer in question was added to a 50 ml conical flask together with a magnet bar (4 cm), and 2 circular pieces of denim (3.5 cm in diameter<br><br>
0.4 g), giving a denim:liquor ratio of 1:25. The flasks were incubated on a magnet stirrer (3 00 rpm) in a water bath at 60°C. Following equilibration, phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) was added to a final concentration of 250 /xM (0.02 M in 96% ethanol) " 6.3 /imole/g together with laccase from Trametes villosa (TvL) to a final concentration of 0.1 LACU/ml " 39 /ig/g, TvL available from Novo Nordisk A/S. Following bleaching the denim swatches were rinsed in tap water and air dried on filter paper overnight, and the resulting degree of bleaching was determined as mentioned above in Example 1.<br>
6 identical flasks were made with each buffer system, and the degree of bleaching was determined after 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes respectively. The results are shown in Table 7.<br>

It can be seen from Table 7 that when using the above described conditions the bleaching process proceeds very fast for the first 10-15 minutes, and that the optimum bleaching time of the denim bleaching process for the T. villosa laccase is around 60 min. and around 45 min. when using B&amp;R buffer and oxalate buffer, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>

Experiments were performed in larger scale (3 00 ml scale) in a launder-ometer. A pH profile in 2 0 mM (NH4)2S04/NaHS04 was made.<br>
An Atlas LP2 launder-ometer was used. 3 00 ml 0.02 M (NH4)2S04/NaHS04 was adjusted to the appropriate pH in the range pH 1.5-7.0. 300 ml buffer was added to a 1200 ml beaker together with 12 g denim (in one piece), giving a denim:liquor ratio of 1:25; additionally 30 LACU " 469 jiq Trametes villosa laccase (TvL - available from Novo Nordisk A/S) and 0.02 0 g phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) were added resulting in a laccase concentration of 39 /ig/g and a PPT concentration of 6.2 /imole/g.<br>
The beakers were sealed and placed in the launder-ometer and processed for 55 minutes (15 minutes heating time 22"C-60°C, 40 minutes holding time). After processing, samples of the processing liquor were diluted in methanol (10-25 x) and analyzed for residual amount of PPT by HPLC.<br>
The KPLC method was based on the following: Column: Supelcosil LC-18-DB, RP C-18, 3.6x250 mm, Eluent: 70% methanol, 30% 25 mM P04 buffer pH 6.5, Flow: 1.0 ml/min, Detection: UV/Vis diode array (monitoring at 238, 296, and 600 nm), Injection: 20 pi,  Sample dilution: Methanol.<br>

and placed in the launder-ometer and processed for 55<br>
minutes (15 minutes heating time 22oC-60°C, 40<br>
minutes holding time).<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen from Table 8 that a high degree of bleaching is achieved at an initial pH in the range of from 3.3 to 5.1, the highest degree of bleaching being at an initial pH value of about 3.6.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Denim Bleaching in Larger Scale (3 00 ml) using acetate as buffer<br>
Experiments similar to the series using (NHJjSO^/NaHSO^ (see Example 7) were made in acetate buffer. Conditions: An Atlas LP2 launder-ometer was used. 300 ml 10 mM acetate buffer pH 3.5-6.5 was added to a 1200 ml beaker together with 12 g denim (in one piece), giving a denim:liquor ratio of 1:25. Additionally 30 LACU " 469 /xg Trametes villosa laccase (TvL) or 30 LACU " 652 fj.g Mvceliophthora thermophila laccase (MtL) - TvL available from Novo Nordisk A/S and MtL produced as described in PCT/US95/06815 - and 0.02 g phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) were added.

The results obtained are shown in Table 9-10 below.<br>

Conditions: 300 ml 0.01 M acetate buffer was added to a 1200 ml beaker together with 12 g denim (in one piece), 30 LACU TvL (to 0.1 LACU/ml), and 0.020 g PPT (to 250 fjLM) . The beakers were sealed and placed in the launder-ometer and processed for 40 minutes (10 minutes heating time 22°C-60°C, 30 minutes holdinct time) .<br><br>
It can be seen from Table 9 that a very high degree of bleaching is achieved at an initial pH value of about 5.5.<br>

Dosage Response with Respect to Phenothiazine-10-Propionic Acid (PPTT in Larger Scale (300 ml)<br>
To illustrate the dosage-response with respect to<br>
PPT,  a series of experiments in launder-ometer scale was<br>
performed. An Atlas LP2 launder-ometer was used. 300 ml 20 mM<br>
i (NH4)2S04/NaHS04 pH 5.4 was added to a 1200 ml beaker together<br>
with 12 g denim (in one piece), 3 0 LACU Trametes villosa (TvL) - available from Novo Nordisk A/S - (to 0.1 LACU/ml), and PPT in the range of from 50 pM to 500 /xM. The conditions were thus: a denim: liquor ratio of 1:25; 39 Mg/g denim TvL and 1.3 /imole/g denim - 12.5 /xmole/g denim PPT.<br>
The beakers were sealed and placed in the launder-ometer and processed for 55 minutes (15 minutes heating time 220C-60°C, 40 minutes holding time). The results obtained are shown in Table 11.<br>

Conditions: 3 00 ml  0.02 M (NH4) 2S04/NaHS04 pH 5.4 was added to a 1200 ml beaker together with 12 g denim (in one piece), 30 LACU TvL (to 0.1 LACU/ml), and PPT in the range 50 j*M - 500 /iM. The beakers were sealed and placed in the launder-ometer and processed for 55 minutes (15 minutes heating time 22°C-60°C, 40 minutes holding time).<br><br><br>
It can be seen from Table 11 that at the above given conditions the degree of bleaching is increased with the increased concentration of PPT.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Bleaching Denim with Peroxidase and Phenothiazine-10-Propionic Acid (PPT) using Different Buffers<br>
To illustrate the bleaching process using peroxidase comparison of 2 high-performance buffers was made using PPT as an enhancing agent.<br>
Method: Each buffer was prepared at a concentration of 0.01 M, and pH adjusted to pH 6.5 with NaOH or with the corresponding acid. 80 ml of the buffer in question was added to a 200 ml glass beaker together with a magnet bar (4 cm), and 8 circular pieces of denim (3.5 cm in diameter ~ 0.4 g) , giving a denim:liquor ratio of 1:25. The glass beaker was incubated on a magnet.,stirrer (300 rpm) in a water bath at 50°C, and a pH electrode was dipped into the liquor in the middle of the beaker in order to monitor and control pH at pH 6.5 (i.e. the experiments were run under pH-stat conditions using a Radiometer pH-stat (PHM 82 or PHM 62 pH meter, TTT 80 Titrator, ABU 80 Autoburette) with automatic titration with the corresponding acid (0.1 M) if and when pH increased above pH 6.5). Following equilibration at pH 6.5, PPT (0.02 M in 96% ethanol) was added to a final concentration of 250 /xM " 6.3 /xmole/g together with peroxidase from Coprinus cinereus (CiP, available from Novo Nordisk A/S) to a final concentration of 1 PODU/ml ~ 5 Mg/9' Reaction was started adding 0.1 ml H202 (0.1 M) corresponding to a final concentration of 0.125 mM H2Oz. The concentration of H202 was monitored using peroxide sticks (Merckoquant Peroxid-Test, Merck, art. 10011). When the sticks indicated that the concentration of H202 was below 2 mg/1 (0.059 mM), another 0.1 ml of H^ was added. However, the PPT radical seemed to interfere with the measurement in that the PPT radical itself (without the presence of H202) was able to colourize the sticks. But, for this purpose, only an indication<br><br>
of low concentration of H202 and low concentration of PPT radical was of interest, since no addition of hydrogen peroxide was needed even if the concentration was zero, as long as PPT radical was present. Only if the concentration of both H202 and PPT radical was low/zero, more H202 should be added. After 30 minutes the denim swatches were rinsed in tap water and air dried on filter paper overnight, and the resulting degree of bleaching was determined as mentioned above in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 12 below.<br>
Table 12<br>
Comparison of bleach performance in acetate and oxalate buffer using 250 /iM PPT and 1 PODU/ml peroxidase (CiP) at pH 6.5 and 50°C. H202 was added semi-continuously over time adding aliquots of 0.1 ml of a stock solution of 0.1 M H202.<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen from Table 12 that a high degree of bleaching can be achieved when using peroxidase, PPT and acetate or oxalate as buffers.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Large Scale Trials (40 Litres) .<br>
Large-scale trials (40 litres) with bleaching of denim using laccase and phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) have been performed giving the results shown below:<br>

40 litres of cold tap water was added together with 4000 LACU " 62500 jig Trametes villosa laccase (TvL - available from Novo Nordisk A/S), giving 0.1 LACU/ml or 39 ng/g denim of TvL; temperature was raised to and maintained at 60°C for a total processing time of 60 minutes, followed by a rinsing/inactivation step with Na2C03 (1 g/l) at 80'C for 15 minutes, followed by a rinse with tap water. After bleaching, the denim was dried in a conventional tumble dryer.<br>
The process resulted in a bleach level of AL*=16-17.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Absorbed Organic Halogens (AOX).<br>
As a result of the chlorine-free bleaching process, AOX was expected to be significantly lower using the enzymatic approach compared to the conventional hypochlorite based process. In Table 13 below, AOX data are shown for various bleach levels using the enzymatic approach and the conventional approach.<br>

Strength Loss.<br>
The enzyme/enhancing agent bleaching process of the present__J.nvention results in a very specific attack on indigo and does not result in a damage of the cotton. This is illustrated in the strength loss of the processed denim. Using the enzyme/enhancing agent bleaching process the strength loss<br><br>
is much lower than by using the conventional hypochlorite process, which is illustrated in Table 14 below.<br>
Stone washed denim was bleached to the same level using hypochlorite and using laccase/PPT, and the strength loss (tear strength of processed denim compared to tear strength of non-processed denim) determined. The results are shown in Table 14 below.<br>

Large-scale trials with bleaching of denim using laccase and phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) have been performed in a fulling machine (stainless steel drum of 1 m diameter and 0.4 m in dept operated at approx. 14 rpm) giving the results shown below: ■<br>
The denim (75x100 cm) was sewn into "legs" (denim cylinders) weighing approximately 350-375 g each (not stone washed). 4 stone washed denim "legs" weighing 1458 g total, 40.8 g Na2-oxalate, 12.0 g oxalic acid x 2 H20 and 1.82 g PPT was loaded into the fulling machine, and 20 litres of hot (55*C) tap water was added resulting in a pH of 5.5 increasing to 7.2 in 5 minutes. The liquor was heated^to 60*C and pH was adjusted to pH 5.6 with 2 ml of 72% H2S04, and 1824 LACU = 28500 ixq TvL (Trametes villosa laccase, available from Novo Nordisk A/S) was added.<br><br>
The conditions used were: 0.02 M oxalate buffer, pH 5.6-6.0, denim: liquor ratio = 1:14, 336 μM PPT = 4.6 μmole PPT/g denim, 0.09 LACU/ml = 19.5 fxg enzyme protein/g denim. The bleaching was stopped after 30 minutes, and the denim rinsed with 2x20 litres of hot (55°C) tap water for 1-2 minutes. Following bleaching, the denim was dried in a conventional tumble drier. The process resulted in a bleach level of AL*: 17-18.<br>

Denim (75x100 cm) was sewn into "legs" (denim cylinders) weighing approximately 350-375 g each (not stone washed). 4 stone washed denim "legs" weighing 1480 g total, 24.2 g Na2-oxalate, 12.5 g oxalic acid x 2 H20, and 1.75 g PPT was loaded into the fulling machine, and 14 litres of hot (55°C) tap water was added and heated to 60'C resulting"in a pH of 4.8. pH was adjusted to pH 5.7 with 1.5 ml 50% NaOH. 1755 LACU = 27422 μq TvL was added (TvL = Trametes villosa laccase, available from Novo Nordisk A/S).<br>
The conditions.used were: 0.02 M oxalate buffer, pH 5.7-5.9, denim:liquor ratio = 1:10, 461 /xM PPT = 4.4 /Limole PPT/g denim, 0.13 LACU/ml = 18.5 jug enzyme protein/g denim. The bleaching was stopped after 30 minutes, and the denim rinsed with 2x40 litres of hot (55°C) tap water for 1-2 minutes. After bleaching, the denim was dried in a conventional tumble drier. The process resulted in a bleach level of AL*: 14-15.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Industrial scale trials (450 litres).<br>
Industrial scale trials (450 litres) with bleaching of denim using laccase and phenothiazine-10-propionic acid (PPT) have been carried out in a front loaded wash extractor<br><br>
(type: "Cherry Tree"), using 50 kg of denim (60 pair of jeans) and 450 litres of water, giving a denim:liquor (w/w) ratio of 1:9. Conditions and dosages were as follows:<br>
Trial 1:  450 g sodium phosphate<br>
125 g di-sodium phosphate<br>
125 g PPT " 9.2 /μg/g denim<br>
90.000 LACU (= 1406 mg) Trametes villosa laccase,<br>
available from Novo Nordisk A/S " 29.2 μg/g denim<br>
30 minutes, pH=6.2, 60'C<br>
Trial 2:  1000 g di-sodium oxalate 175 g oxalic acid 125 g PPT " 9.2 fig/g  denim<br>
90.000 LACU (= 1406 mg) Trametes villosa laccase 29.2 μg/g denim 30 minutes, pH=5.5, 60'C<br>
Following bleaching, the denim was tumble dried. The process resulted in bleach levels of AL*=16 (trial 1) and AL*=21 (trial 2).<br><br><br>
