				<td>TREATMENT METHOD FOR OPTICAL FIBER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a treatment method for an optical fiber.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
After rendering optical fibers into a cable and laying the optical fiber cable, the<br>
transmission loss in a wavelength band of about 1400 nm of the optical fiber increases,<br>
and the transmission characteristics of the optical fiber degrade.<br>
In order to inhibit this degradation of the optical fiber transmission<br>
characteristics, a treatment method for optical fibers is applied in which an optical fiber is<br>
exposed to hydrogen or deuterium in advance.<br>
However, when carrying out a treatment method in which the optical fiber is<br>
exposed to hydrogen (hydrogen treatment), there is a problem in that the initial<br>
transmission loss of the optical fiber in a wavelength region of about 1383 nm increases.<br>
In contrast, when carrying out a treatment method in which the optical fiber is exposed to<br>
deuterium (deuterium treatment), no such problem occurs. Thus, the hydrogen<br>
treatment or the deuterium treatment must be selected and applied depending on the<br>
object<br>
Various methods have been proposed for applying a deuterium treatment to an<br>
optical fiber. In one method (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2003-137580), a gas that contains deuterium gas<br>
(hereinbelow, referred to as a "deuterium containing gas") continuously flows into a<br>
scalable treatment chamber, and the atmosphere in the treatment chamber is replaced by<br>
the deuterium containing gas. In another method (see, for example, Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-226979), after decreasing<br>
the pressure inside the treatment chamber, the inside of the treatment chamber is filled<br>
with the deuterium containing gas, and thereby the atmosphere inside the treatment<br>
chamber is replaced by the deuterium containing gas. In the latter method, recovery of<br>
the deuterium containing gas is possible.<br>
In addition, the hydrogen test method stipulated in IEC60793-2-50 is an<br>
example of a method for applying a hydrogen treatment to an optical fiber. In this<br>
hydrogen test method, an optical fiber is exposed to 1% hydrogen gas atmosphere or<br>
100% hydrogen gas atmosphere at room temperature until the transmission loss at a<br>
wavelength of 1240 nm is equal to or greater than 0.03 dB/km. However, in this<br>
hydrogen test method, specific conditions of the treatment methods (treatment<br>
conditions) are not stipulated.<br>
In the case in which a deuterium treatment is applied to an optical fiber, when<br>
using the method in which the deuterium containing gas continuously flows into the<br>
treatment chamber, the treatment is applied while eliminating deuterium containing gas<br>
until the inside of the treatment chamber reaches a predetermined deuterium<br>
concentration. Thus, each time the deuterium treatment is applied, it is possible to<br>
maintain a predetermined deuterium concentration in the treatment chamber.<br>
However, in order to increase the production efficiency, the treatment must be<br>
applied at one time to an optical fiber having a long length, and accompanying this, the<br>
volume of the treatment chamber for applying the treatment to the optical fiber becomes<br>
large. Depending on how large the volume of the treatment chamber becomes, the<br>
amount of deuterium containing gas necessary for replacing the atmosphere in the<br>
treatment chamber increases, and thereby the cost also increases.<br>
In contrast, when using the method in which the treatment chamber is filled with<br>
deuterium containing gas after the pressure in the treatment chamber has been reduced,<br>
because creating a complete vacuum inside the treatment chamber is difficult, air that<br>
remains in the treatment chamber from each treatment mixes with the deuterium<br>
containing gas. As the number of treatments increases, the deuterium concentration in<br>
the recovered deuterium containing gas becomes low.<br>
When the deuterium concentration in the deuterium containing gas becomes low,<br>
there are also concerns in mat not only is a long time required until the deuterium has<br>
sufficiently permeated the optical fiber, but also that the deuterium treatment may<br>
become inadequate. Thus, in order to prevent defective deuterium treatments, it is<br>
necessary to monitor the deuterium concentration when applying the deuterium treatment<br>
to the optical fiber.<br>
An inflammable gas detector, an optical gas densitometer, or the like are<br>
examples of devices that measure the deuterium concentration. When using an<br>
air-based deuterium containing gas, it is possible to measure the deuterium concentration<br>
by such measuring devices. Note that here, any gas whose composition ratios are<br>
similar to those of the atmosphere is referred to as "air".<br>
However, when air is mixed into the deuterium containing gas and the<br>
composition ratios of the gas differ from those of the atmosphere, it becomes impossible<br>
to measure the deuterium concentration correctly by using the measuring devices<br>
described above. In a combustion densitometer such as an inflammable gas detector,<br>
deuterium is combusted, and the deuterium concentration is calculated from the amount<br>
of heat generated during the combustion. Thus, in the case in which, instead of air, an<br>
inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium, or the like serves as the base, the combustion<br>
becomes poor, and thus the concentration cannot be correctly measured.<br>
In addition, in an optical densitometer such as an optical gas densitometer, the<br>
deuterium concentration is calculated from the relative index of refraction of the<br>
deuterium containing gas. Thus, in the case in which the composition ratio of the gas<br>
that serves as the base fluctuates, it is not possible to measure the deuterium<br>
concentration correctly.<br>
In addition, it is possible to measure the deuterium concentration by analyzing<br>
the molecules of the deuterium gas included in the deuterium containing gas. However,<br>
this is not preferable because the measurement takes time, and thus the production costs<br>
drastically increase.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In consideration of the problems described above, an object of the invention is to<br>
provide a treatment method for an optical liber that can correctly control a deuterium<br>
concentration even when a gas that serves as abase of a deuterium containing gas is a gas<br>
other than air, and a composition ratio of a gas that serves as a base fluctuates.<br>
The invention provides a treatment method for an optical fiber, including:<br>
accommodating an optical fiber inside a treatment chamber, introducing a deuterium<br>
containing gas into the treatment chamber; and in the deuterium treatment step, exposing<br>
the optical fiber to atmosphere of the deuterium containing gas, wherein, in the deuterium<br>
treatment step, a deuterium concentration D in the treatment chamber during the<br>
deuterium treatment is calculated from an initial value A of a deuterium concentration in<br>
the deuterium containing gas inside the treatment chamber, a concentration B of oxygen<br>
in an ambient atmosphere of the treatment chamber, and a concentration C of oxygen in<br>
the deuterium containing gas inside the treatment chamber, and the deuterium<br>
concentration in the treatment chamber is controlled based on the deuterium<br>
concentration D calculated.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber, the deuterium concentration D in<br>
the treatment chamber during the deuterium treatment step can be calculated using EQ. 1<br>
below:<br>
D-Ax(l-C/B) EQ. 1<br>
where A indicates the initial value of the deuterium concentration in the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside the treatment chamber, B indicates the concentration of oxygen in<br>
the ambient atmosphere (air) of the treatment chamber, and C indicates the concentration<br>
of oxygen in the deuterium containing gas inside the treatment chamber.<br>
The invention further provides a treatment method for an optical fiber,<br>
including: accommodating an optical fiber inside a treatment chamber; introducing a<br>
hydrogen containing gas into the treatment chamber, and in a hydrogen treatment step,<br>
exposing the optical fiber to atmosphere of the hydrogen containing gas, wherein, in the<br>
hydrogen treatment step, a hydrogen concentration 5 in the treatment chamber during the<br>
hydrogen treatment is calculated from an initial value a of a hydrogen concentration in<br>
the hydrogen containing gas inside the treatment chamber, a concentration β of oxygen in<br>
an ambient atmosphere of the treatment chamber, and a concentration γ of oxygen in the<br>
hydrogen containing gas inside the treatment chamber, and the hydrogen concentration in<br>
the treatment chamber is controlled based on the hydrogen concentration δ calculated.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber, the hydrogen concentration 6 in the<br>
treatment chamber during the hydrogen treatment step is calculated using EQ. 2 below:<br>
δ-αx(i-γ/β) EQ. 2<br>
where a indicates the initial value of the hydrogen concentration in the hydrogen<br>
containing gas inside the treatment chamber, β indicates the concentration of oxygen in<br>
the ambient atmosphere (air) of the treatment chamber, and y indicates the concentration<br>
of oxygen in the hydrogen containing gas inside the treatment chamber.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber described above, preferably the<br>
treatment chamber is a sealed chamber.<br>
In the treatment memod for an optical fiber described above, a reduced pressure<br>
state may preferably be created inside the treatment chamber before the deuterium<br>
containing gas is introduced Preferably, but not necessarily, pressure in the treatment<br>
chamber during the reduced pressure state is set within a range of equal to or greater than<br>
0.01 kPa to equal to or less than 75 kPa.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber described above, partial pressure of<br>
deuterium during the deuterium treatment step may preferably be set within a range of<br>
equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa to equal to or less than 5 kPa, and partial pressure of<br>
hydrogen during the hydrogen treatment step may preferably be set within a range of<br>
equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa to equal to or less than 4 kPa.<br>
In the treatment memod for an optical fiber described above, pressure in the<br>
treatment chamber during the deuterium treatment step or the hydrogen treatment step<br>
may preferably, but not necessarily, be set within a range of equal to or greater than 10.1<br>
kPa to equal to or less than 203 kPa.<br>
In the treatment memod for an optical fiber described above, temperature inside<br>
the treatment chamber may be maintained at a constant temperature within a range of<br>
equal to or greater man S'C to equal to or less than 40°C during the deuterium treatment<br>
step or the hydrogen treatment step.<br>
According to the treatment method for an optical fiber of the invention, in the<br>
case in which concentration control of the gas used in a treatment of an optical fiber is<br>
necessary, even in the case in which direct measurement of the concentration is not<br>
possible due to the capacity of the concentration measuring device, it is possible to<br>
measure the concentration of the oxygen mixed in the measured gas inside the treatment<br>
chamber and easily calculate the concentration of the measured gas from this oxygen<br>
concentration. Therefore, in order to determine the concentration of the measured gas,<br>
it is not necessary to extract the measured gas and analyze the measured gas by using a<br>
complicated analyzing apparatus such as gas chromatography. Thereby, it is possible to<br>
determine the concentration of the measured gas easily at that time. Thus, a treatment<br>
method for an optical fiber of the invention is an advantageous treatment method in terms<br>
of manufacture because it is possible to reduce cost and time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Below, a treatment method for an optical fiber mat applies embodiments of the<br>
invention will be explained in detail.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of the invention, first, during the<br>
fabrication step of the optical fiber, in order to annihilate non-bridging oxygen hole<br>
centers (hereinbelow, abbreviated "NBOHCs") generated in the optical fiber, a deuterium<br>
treatment or a hydrogen treatment is applied to the optical fiber (in the first embodiment<br>
to the fourth embodiment).<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic structural drawing showing an example of the optical fiber<br>
treatment apparatus that is used in the treatment method for an optical fiber according to<br>
the invention.<br>
In FIG. 1, reference symbol 1 denotes the optical fiber treatment apparatus,<br>
reference symbol 1a denotes a reaction chamber, reference symbol lb denotes a gas inlet,<br>
reference symbol 1c denotes a gas inlet opening and closing valve, reference symbol 1d<br>
denotes a gas supply piping, reference symbol 1 e denotes an outlet, reference symbol 1f<br>
denotes a discharge opening and closing valve, 1g denotes a discharge pump, reference<br>
symbol 1h denotes a differential pressure gauge, reference symbol 2 denotes an optical<br>
fiber, and reference symbol 3 denotes a bobbin. This example of an optical fiber<br>
treatment apparatus 1 includes at least the reaction chamber 1a. The reaction chamber<br>
1a is a scalable chamber that can accommodate therein the optical fiber 2, and has a<br>
vacuum state of about 0.1 kPa and a pressure resistance and sealing performance that can<br>
withstand a pressurized state from normal pressure to a pressure that is equal to or less<br>
than 250 kPa.<br>
The gas supply piping 1d is connected to the gas inlet lb of the reaction chamber<br>
la via the gas inlet opening and closing valve 1 c. The deuterium containing gas can be<br>
supplied into the reaction chamber 1a ffym the gas supply piping 1 d.<br>
Here, deuterium containing gas denotes deuterium gas alone or a mixed gas that<br>
contains deuterium gas.<br>
The discharge pump 1g is connected to the outlet 1e of the reaction chamber la<br>
via the discharge opening and closing vaqlve 1f. The deuterium containing gas or the<br>
like in the reaction chamber 1 a is discharged by this discharge pump 1 g.<br>
The differential pressure gauge1h is disposed in the reaction chamber la, and<br>
thereby the pressure inside the reaction chamber 1 a can be measured. Based on the<br>
values measured by the differential pressure gauge In, it is possible to adjust the supplied<br>
amount of deuterium containing gas and thereby create a deuterium containing gas<br>
atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a that has a predetermined pressure, or to start<br>
or stop the discharge pump 1g and thereby create a reduced pressure atmosphere inside<br>
the reaction chamber la that has a predetermined pressure.<br>
In addition, the reaction chamber 1a includes a temperature adjusting means (not<br>
shown) such as a heater or cooling mechanism, a thermometer (not shown), or a<br>
temperature adjusting portion (not shown). Thereby, by adjusting the internal<br>
temperature, it is possible to maintain a state of constant temperature within a range of<br>
5°C to 40°C inside the reaction chamber 1a.<br>
Note that instead of the gas inlet opening and closing valve 1 c, the reaction<br>
chamber 1a may include a solenoid valve (not shown) that is capable of adjusting the<br>
amount of the gas flow. However, any device that can adjust the amount of deuterium<br>
containing gas supplied into the reaction chamber 1 a may be used.<br>
Next, a first embodiment of the treatment method (NBOHC annihi1ation) for an<br>
optica] fiber according to the invention will be exp1ained with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of this embodiment, in a first step,<br>
an optical fiber 2 is exposed to the reduced pressure atmosphere as exp1ained below.<br>
First, the optical fiber 2 having a predetermined length is wound around the<br>
bobbin 3.<br>
Next, the optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 is p1aced in<br>
the reaction chamber 1 a of the treatment apparatus 1. The optical fiber 2 is not<br>
particu1arly limited as long as it is made of a silica g1ass or the like, and otherwise any<br>
type of optical fiber can be used.<br>
Next, after the discharge pump 1g, which is a vacuum pump, is activated, the<br>
discharge opening and closing valve 1f is opened, a reduced pressure atmosphere is<br>
created inside the reaction chamber 1a, that is, inside the space accommodating the<br>
optical fiber 2, is reduced by discharging the air inside the reaction chamber 1a, and<br>
thereby the optical fiber 2 is exposed to a reduced pressure atmosphere.<br>
Then, in a second step, following the first step, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to<br>
the deuterium containing gas atmosphere as described below.<br>
After the discharge opening and closing valve 1f is closed, the temperature<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is adjusted to provide a state of constant temperature<br>
within a range of 5°C to 40°C by using a temperature adjusting means (not shown), a<br>
thermometer (not shown), or a temperature adjusting portion (not shown). Next, the gas<br>
inlet opening and closing valve 1c is opened and the deuterium containing gas is supplied<br>
into the reduced pressure atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a. The deuterium<br>
containing gas is supplied until the inside of the reaction chamber 1a reaches a<br>
predetermined pressure and the atmosphere inside the space in the reaction chamber 1 a<br>
that accommodates the optical fiber 2 has been rep1aced by the deuterium containing gas.<br>
Then the inside of the reaction chamber 1a is sealed by closing the gas inlet opening and<br>
closing valve 1c. The optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium obtaining gas<br>
atmosphere inside this reaction chamber 1a. Thereby, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to<br>
the deuterium containing gas atmosphere, and by reacting the NBOHCs in the silica g1ass<br>
that forms the optical fiber 2 with the deuterium (D2) to produce deuterated hydroxyl<br>
groups (-OD), it is possible to prevent the generation of hydroxyl groups (-OH).<br>
Thereby, it is possible to shift the absorption wavelength region of the optical fiber 2<br>
from the 1.38 μm band, which is the absorption wavelength region of the hydroxyl group,<br>
to the 1.87 μm band, which is the absorption wavelength region of the deuterated<br>
hydroxyl group. That is to say, the wavelength absorption region is shifted outside of<br>
the optical communication wavelength region. Thus, it is possible to inhibit the<br>
degradation of the transmission characteristics of the optica] fiber 2 due to absorption<br>
loss caused by the hydroxyl groups in the silica g1ass.<br>
In addition, according to the treatment method for an optical fiber of this<br>
embodiment, the dispersion rate of the deuterium containing gas in the reaction chamber<br>
1a can be increased by creating a reduced pressure atmosphere inside the reaction<br>
chamber 1 a that accommodates the optical fiber 2 and supplying the deuterium<br>
containing gat into the reaction chamber 1a in this reduced pressure atmosphere state.<br>
Thereby, even when the optical fiber 2 is wound around the bobbin 3, the deuterium<br>
containing gas passes through the minute gaps between the wound optical fiber 2 and<br>
spreads quickly into proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to increase the probability of contact between the optical fiber 2 in proximity to the coil<br>
core of the bobbin 3 and the deuterium gas. Thus, it is possible to apply a sufficient<br>
(uniform) deuterium treatment throughout the entire length of the optical fiber 2.<br>
Because the NBOHCs easily bond to the deuterium to form deuterated hydroxy]<br>
groups, the reaction in which the NBOHCs and the deuterium bind to form deuterated<br>
hydroxyl groups (i.e., the reaction that annihi1ates NBOHCs) is greatly influenced by the<br>
probability of contact between the NBOHCs and the deuterium gas.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of this embodiment, as described<br>
above, at the optical fiber in proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3, it is possible to<br>
increase the probability of contact between the optical fiber 2 and the deuterium<br>
containing gas, and thereby it is possible to increase the reaction rate between the<br>
NBOHCs and the deuterium.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to increase the reaction rate between the NBOHCs and<br>
the deuterium throughout the entire optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the<br>
bobbin 3, and it is possible to annihi1ate NBOHCs throughout the entire optical fiber<br>
even if the exposure time is short by using the low concentration deuterium containing<br>
gas.<br>
Next, based on experimental results, the treatment method for an optical fiber of<br>
mis embodiment will be explained in detail.<br>
HO. 2 is a graph showing the re1ationship between the annihi1ation de1ay time<br>
of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 and the<br>
pressure of the reduced pressure atmosphere in the first step described above.<br>
In FIG. 2, the rhombic symbols indicate the results of the case in which, in the<br>
second step, the partial pressure of the deuterium gas in the mixed gas atmosphere is 0.5<br>
kPa and the circu1ar symbols indicate the result of the case in which, in the second step,<br>
the partial pressure of the deuterium gas in the mixed gas atmosphere is 1.0 kPa.<br>
The annihi1ation de1ay time of the NBOHCs denotes the difference between the<br>
annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 positioned in the innermost 1ayer<br>
and the annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 positioned in the<br>
outermost 1ayer, that is, the difference between the annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs of<br>
the optical fiber 2 positioned in the innermost 1ayer with respect to the annihi1ation time<br>
of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 positioned in the outermost 1ayer.<br>
Among the portions of the optical fiber 2 that have been wound around the<br>
bobbin 3. the optical fiber 2 positioned in the innermost 1ayer denotes the portion (optical<br>
fiber 2) directly wound around the coil core of the bobbin 3. In contrast, among the<br>
portions of the optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3, the optical fiber<br>
2 positioned in the outermost 1ayer denotes the portion (optical fiber 2) positioned in the<br>
outermost 1ayer.<br>
The shorter the annihi1ation de1ay time of the NBOHCs means that the<br>
annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs in the optical fiber 2 positioned in the innermost 1ayer<br>
is also shorter (the reaction in which the NBOHCs are annihi1ated is fast), The<br>
annihi1ation time of the innermost 1ayer becomes a value that is close to the annihi1ation<br>
time of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 positioned in the outermost 1ayer. This<br>
means that the time necessary to annihi1ate the NBOHCs throughout the entire optical<br>
fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 is short<br>
The annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs of the optical fiber 2 denotes the result of<br>
measurement by tile following method.<br>
The amount of absorption at 0.63 μm, which is the absorption wavelength of the<br>
NBOHCs, is measured in an optical fiber 2 that has been exposed to the deuterium gas<br>
for a predetermined time, and the remaining amount of NBOHCs is measured based on<br>
this absorption amount<br>
Then the change over time in the remaining amount of NBOHCs with respect to<br>
the exposure time of the optical fiber 2 to the deuterium containing gas is found, the<br>
exposure time to the deuterium containing gas necessary to annihi1ate the NBOHCs<br>
completely is estithated based on the change over time in the remaining amount of<br>
NBOHCs, and this estithation serves as the annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs.<br>
In the first step described above, the pressure of the reduced pressure<br>
atmosphere can be equal to or greater than 0.01 kPa and equal to or less than 75 kPa, and<br>
can also be equal to or greater than 0.01 kPa and equal to or less than 50kPa, By<br>
making the pressure of the reduced pressure atmosphere equal to or greater than 0.01 kPa<br>
and equal to or less than 75 kPa, it is possible to make the dispersion rate of the<br>
deuterium containing gas high, and it is possible to make the deuterium containing gas<br>
spread throughout the entire optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 or<br>
the like. Thus, in the optical fiber 2 in proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3, it is<br>
possible to make the probability of contact between the NBOHCs and the deuterium gas<br>
high, and thereby it is possible to accelerate the reaction between the NBOHCs and the<br>
deuterium gas (the reaction that annihi1ates the NBOHCs). According to the above, it is<br>
possible to make the annihi1ation time of the NBOHCs in the optical fiber 2 positioned in<br>
the innermost 1ayer short, and thereby, as shown in FIG. 2, the annihi1ation de1ay time of<br>
the NBOHCs can be greatly reduced<br>
In addition, because it is possible to make the probability of contact between the<br>
NBOHCs and the deuterium gas high, in the second step it is possible to annihi1ate<br>
NBOHCs throughout the entire optical fiber 2 even if a low concentration deuterium<br>
containing gas is used and the exposure time is made short<br>
In particu1ar, in the case in which the pressure of the reduced pressure<br>
atmosphere is equal to or greater than 0.01 kPa and equal to or less than SO kPa, the<br>
annihi1ation de1ay time of the NBOHCs becomes 0 or about 0, where the annihi1ation<br>
de1ay time is negligible. Thus, the NBOHCs react with the deuterium at the same<br>
reaction rate in both the optical fiber 2 positioned in the innermost 1ayer and the optical<br>
fiber 2 positioned in the outermost 1ayer, and thereby the NBOHCs can be annihi1ated.<br>
In addition, in the second step described above, preferably the optical fiber 2 is<br>
exposed to a deuterium containing gas in which the partial pressure of the deuterium gas<br>
is equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa and equal to or less than 5 kPa. Thereby, it is<br>
possible to spread deuterium gas having a concentration that is sufficient to annihi1ate<br>
NBOHCs throughout the entire optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3<br>
or the like.<br>
A partial pressure of the deuterium gas less than 0.1 kPa is not preferable<br>
because the concentration of the deuterium is low, and thus it is difficult to annihi1ate<br>
NBOHCs throughout the entire optical fiber 2. In contrast, a partial pressure of the<br>
deuterium gas greater man 5 kPa is not preferable because a high concentration of<br>
deuterium is necessary, and thereby the fabrication cost becomes high.<br>
In addition, in the second step, preferably the deuterium containing gas is<br>
supplied into the reaction chamber 1 a that accommodates the optical fiber 2 to create a<br>
pressure inside the reaction chamber 1a equal to or greater than 10.1 kPa and equal to or<br>
less than 203 kPa, and the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium containing gas in<br>
this pressure range.<br>
Thereby, the diffusion rate of the deuterium containing gas inside the reaction<br>
chamber 1a becomes high, the deuterium containing gas can spread quickly into<br>
proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3, and thereby it is possible to make the reaction<br>
rate between the NBOHCs and the deuterium high.<br>
The case in which the pressure of the deuterium containing gas in the reaction<br>
chamber 1 a in which the optical fiber 2 is exposed is less than 10.1 kPa is not preferable<br>
because the diffusion rate of the deuterium containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1 a<br>
is low and thus the reaction in which the NBOHCs are annihi1ated requires a long time.<br>
In addition, the case in which the pressure of the deuterium containing gas in the<br>
reaction chamber 1a in which me optical fiber 2 is exposed is greater than 203 kPa is not<br>
preferable because a reaction chamber 1a having a high pressure resistance must be used,<br>
and taking into consideration safety and the like, handling of the reaction chamber 1a<br>
becomes difficult<br>
In the second step, preferably, but not necessarily, the exposure time during<br>
which the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium containing gas is one day or less.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to annihi1ate the NBOHCs throughout the entire optical fiber 2<br>
that has been wound around the bobbin 3.<br>
In the second step, preferably, but not necessarily, the optical fiber 2 is exposed<br>
to the deuterium containing gas in a state in which the temperature inside the reaction<br>
chamber 1a is adjusted so as to maintain a constant temperature within a range of equal<br>
to or greater man 5°C to equal to or less man 40°C. Thereby, it is possible to accelerate<br>
the reaction between the NBOHCs in the silica g1ass and the deuterium, and it is possible<br>
to annihi1ate the NBOHCs in a short period of time.<br>
The case in which the temperature inside the reaction chamber 1a is higher than<br>
40 °C is not preferable because the surface covering resin 1ayer of the optical fiber 2 will<br>
change due to the heat<br>
FIG. 3 is a schethatic structural diagram showing another example of the optical<br>
fiber treatment apparatus used in the treatment method for an optical fiber according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The optical fiber treatment apparatus 4 in this example essentially includes a<br>
reaction chamber 4a, a deuterium storage tank 4b, and piping 4c by which the reaction<br>
chamber 4a communicates with the deuterium storage tank 4b.<br>
The reaction chamber 4a is a sca1able chamber that can accommodate an optical<br>
fiber 2 therein (first space), and has a vacuum state of about 0.1 kPa and a pressure<br>
resistance and sealing performance that can withstand a pressurized state from normal<br>
pressure to a pressure equal to or less than 250 kPa.<br>
The deuterium storage tank 4b is a tank that can store the deuterium containing<br>
gas therein (second space), and, like the reaction chamber 4a, has a vacuum state of about<br>
0.1 kPa and a pressure resistance and sealing performance that can withstand a<br>
pressurized state from normal pressure to a pressure equal to or less than 250 kPa,<br>
The gas supply piping 4g is connected to the gas inlet 4d of the deuterium<br>
storage tank 4b via a gas inlet opening and closing valve 4f, and it is possible to supply<br>
the deuterium containing gas into the reaction chamber 4a from this gas supply piping 4g.<br>
Gas inlet and outlet openings 4h and 4i are included in the reaction chamber 4a<br>
and the deuterium storage tank 4b. The piping 4c connects to these gas inlet and outlet<br>
openings 4h and 4i via the opening and closing valves 4j and 4k, and the reaction<br>
chamber 4a and the deuterium storage tank 4b communicate via the one piping 4c.<br>
The inside of the piping 4c (third space) serves as the flow path, and the<br>
deuterium containing gas can flow to or from either the reaction chamber 4a or the<br>
deuterium storage tank 4b. A switching valve 4n is included along the course of the<br>
piping 4c, and a discharge pipe 4p and a gas venti1ation device 4q are connected to this<br>
switching valve 4n.<br>
Any valve that has connection portions that conduct in at least three directions<br>
and that can switch the path from the connection portion in one direction to the<br>
connection portions in any of the other two directions can be used as the switching valve<br>
4n, A three-direction valve or a three-direction solenoid valve can be an example of the<br>
switching valve 4n.<br>
In addition, a combination pressurizing and depressurizing pump such as a scroll<br>
vacuum pump or a dry-vacuum diaphragm pump can be used as the gas venti1ation<br>
device 4q.<br>
In the description below, a portion of the path of the piping from the switching<br>
valve 4n to the gas inlet and outlet opening 4h of the reaction chamber 4a is referred to as<br>
the reaction chamber side piping 4r, and a portion of the path of the piping from the<br>
switching valve 4n to the gas inlet and outlet opening 4i of the deuterium storage tank 4b<br>
is referred to as the deuterium storage tank side piping 4s.<br>
In this embodiment, the switching valve 4n enables switching from one path<br>
among the reaction chamber side piping 4r, the deuterium storage tank side piping 4s,<br>
and the discharge pipe 4p to any one of the paths of the other two directions, and the gas<br>
ventilation device 4q enables venti1ating the gas from one direction to the other direction<br>
among the two switched paths.<br>
A differential pressure gauge 4t is disposed in the reaction chamber 4a, and<br>
thereby the pressurein the reaction chamber 4a can be measured. By using the gas<br>
venti1ation device 4q to adjust the supplied amount of deuterium containing gas based on<br>
this measured value, it is possible to provide the inside of the reaction chamber 4a with a<br>
deuterium containing gas atmosphere that has a predetermined pressure, or create a<br>
reduced pressure atmosphere that has a predetermined pressure inside of the reaction<br>
chamber 4a.<br>
In addition, the reaction chamber 4a includes a temperature adjusting means<br>
(not shown) such as a heater or cooling mechanism, a thermometer (not shown), or a<br>
temperature adjusting portion (not shown), and thereby it is possible to maintain a state<br>
of constant temperature within a range of 5°C to 40°C inside the reaction chamber 4a by<br>
adjusting the internal temperature.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the treatment method for an optical fiber<br>
according to the invention will be exp1ained with reference to HO. 3.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of this embodiment, in a first step,<br>
the optical fiber 2 is exposed to a reduced pressure atmosphere as exp1ained below.<br>
First, an optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 is p1aced inside<br>
the reaction chamber 4a. The temperature inside the reaction chamber 4a is adjusted to<br>
a constant temperature within a range of 5°C to 40°C. Then the switching valve 4n is<br>
switched so as to connect the reaction chamber side piping 4r and the discharge pipe 4p.<br>
Next, the opening and closing valve 4j of the reaction chamber side piping 4r is<br>
opened, the air in the reaction chamber 4a is discharged to the discharge pipe 4p by the<br>
gas venti1ation device 4q, a reduced pressure atmosphere is created inside of the reaction<br>
chamber 4a, that is, inside the first space that accommodates the optical fiber 2, and the<br>
optical fiber 2 is exposed to the reduced pressure atmosphere.<br>
Next, in the second step, following the first step, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to<br>
the deuterium containing gas as exp1ained below.<br>
The inside of the deuterium storage tank 4b is filled in advance with a deuterium<br>
containing gas that includes a predetermined concentration of deuterium gas at a<br>
predetermined pressure.<br>
Next, after closing the opening and closing valve 4j of the reaction chamber side<br>
piping 4r, the switching valve 4n is switched so that the reaction chamber side piping 4r<br>
and the deuterium storage tank side piping 4s are connected. Then the opening and<br>
closing valve 4j of the reaction chamber side piping 4r and the opening and closing valve<br>
4k of the deuterium storage tank side piping 4s are opened, and the reaction chamber 4a<br>
and the deuterium storage tank 4b communicate via the piping 4c.<br>
In this manner, the inside of the piping 4c (third space) serves as a passage<br>
enabling the deuterium containing gas in the deuterium storage tank 4b to flow to the<br>
reaction chamber 4a, which has a reduced pressure atmosphere.<br>
Next, when the inside of the reaction chamber 4a reaches a predetermined<br>
pressure, the reaction chamber 4a is sealed by closing the opening and closing valve 4j of<br>
the reaction chamber side piping 4r and the opening and closing valve 4k of the<br>
deuterium storage tank side piping 4s. The optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside this reaction chamber 4a.<br>
According to the above, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium<br>
containing gas, the NBOHCs in the silica g1ass and the deuterium bind to form<br>
deuterated hydroxyl groups, and thereby it is possible to annihilate the NBOHCs.<br>
Next, the switching valve 4n is switched so that the reaction chamber side piping<br>
4r and the deuterium storage tank side piping 4s communicate. The opening and<br>
closing valves 4j and 4k are opened, the reaction chamber 4a and the deuterium storage<br>
tank 4b communicate via the piping 4c, the gas venti1ation device 4q is activated, the<br>
deuterium containing gas inside the reaction chamber 4a is transferred to the deuterium<br>
storage tank 4b, and a vacuum is created in the inside of the reaction chamber 4a.<br>
Next, after the opening and closing valve 4j on the reaction chamber side piping<br>
4r is closed and air is introduced into the reaction chamber 4a, the optical fiber 2 is<br>
extracted from the reaction chamber 4a.<br>
According to the above, without discharging the deuterium containing gas that<br>
has been used once, the deuterium containing gas is stored in the deuterium storage tank<br>
4b and thus can be used in the deuterium treatment of another optical fiber 2.<br>
FIG. 4 is a graph showing the change in the partial pressure of the deuterium gas<br>
in the deuterium containing gas when, using the optical fiber treatment apparatus 4 of<br>
FIG. 3, optical fibers 2 have been treated by repeatedly using the deuterium containing<br>
gas.<br>
In the case in which the optical fiber treatment apparatus 4 of FIG. 3 is used,<br>
even after the deuterium treatment has been carried out 30 times, the retention rate of the<br>
partial pressure of the deuterium is equal to or greater than 70%. This concentration<br>
allows satisfactory deuterium treatment to be carried out<br>
In this manner, it is possible to use the deuterium containing gas repeatedly, so<br>
that it is possible to reduce the running costs associated with the deuterium gas<br>
significantly, thereby creating an inexpensive deuterium treatment.<br>
Next, a third embodiment of the treatment method for an optical fiber according<br>
to the invention will be exp1ained with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
The treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment, which annihi1ates<br>
the NBOHCs using a deuterium treatment, is for inhibiting an increase in the<br>
transmission loss in the optical fiber after being 1aid.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of this embodiment, first an optical<br>
fiber 2 having a predetermined length is wound around a bobbin 3.<br>
Next, the optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 is p1aced<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a of the treatment apparatus 1.<br>
Then, after closing the discharge opening and closing valve 1 f, the temperature<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is adjusted so as to maintain a state of constant<br>
temperature within a range of 5°C to 40°C by a temperature adjusting means (not shown),<br>
a thermometer (not shown), or a temperature adjusting portion (not shown).<br>
Next, the gas inlet opening and closing valve 1c is opened, the deuterium<br>
containing gas is supplied into the reaction chamber 1a, and while carrying out control<br>
such that the deuterium concentration in the deuterium containing gas inside this reaction<br>
chamber 1a is constant, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium containing gas<br>
atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a-<br>
in this embodiment, in the deuterium treatment step described above, first the<br>
concentration B of the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a<br>
is measured Next, the concentration C of the oxygen in the deuterium containing gas<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is measured. The deuterium concentration D inside the<br>
reaction chamber 1a during the deuterium treatment is calcu1ated from the results of these<br>
measurements and the initial value A of the deuterium concentration in the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber (treatment chamber) 1 a using the following<br>
BQ. 1. Based on the calcu1ated deuterium concentration D, the deuterium concentration<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is maintained at a concentration necessary for carrying out<br>
the deuterium treatment for the optical fiber 2 inside the reaction chamber 1 a sufficiently.<br>
Specifically, in the case in which the deuterium concentration inside the reaction<br>
chamber 1 a does not reach the concentration required for the deuterium treatment, the<br>
gas inlet opening and closing valve 1c is opened and deuterium containing gas is<br>
supplied into the reaction chamber 1a. In contrast, in the case in which the deuterium<br>
concentration inside the reaction chamber 1a exceeds the concentration required for the<br>
deuterium treatment, the gas inlet opening and closing valve 1c is closed and the supply<br>
of the deuterium containing gas into the reaction chamber 1a is stopped.<br>
D=Ax(l-C/B) EQ. 1<br>
where D indicates a deuterium concentration inside the treatment chamber during the<br>
deuterium treatment, A indicates an initial value of the deuterium concentration in the<br>
deuterium containing gas inside the treatment chamber, B indicates concentration of<br>
oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (six) of the treatment chamber, and C indicates<br>
concentration of oxygen in the deuterium containing gas inside the treatment chamber.<br>
An oxygen densitometer (not shown) was used in order to measure the<br>
concentration B of the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a<br>
and the concentration C of the oxygen in the deuterium containing gas inside the reaction<br>
chamber 1a. Examples of oxygen densitometers that may be used are Toray's LC-750<br>
and Yokogawa's oxygen densitometer 0X61.<br>
In this manner, by measuring the concentration B of the oxygen in the ambient<br>
atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a and the concentration C of the oxygen in the<br>
deuterium containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a, it is possible to calcu1ate the<br>
amount of air mixed in the atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a, and based on this<br>
calcu1ated value, it is possible to calcu1ate the present deuterium concentration inside the<br>
reaction chamber 1 a. Because there are dangers such as explosions when the gas used<br>
in the treatment of the optical fiber is an inf1ammable gas (deuterium) as in the deuterium<br>
treatment, in terms of control, measurement of the deuterium concentration using a<br>
conventional combustion densitometer or an optical densitometer is not preferable. In<br>
addition, in the case in which a deuterium containing gas is used as the gas serving as the<br>
base, the present deuterium concentration inside the reaction chamber 1a is calcu1ated by<br>
measuring the concentration of the air, and in particu1ar the oxygen, mixed in the<br>
deuterium containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a. The reason for this is that a<br>
cause of the deuterium concentration becoming low is the air mixed into the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a during the deuterium treatment<br>
Therefore, if the amount (concentration) of the air (oxygen) mixed into the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1 a can be determined, then it is possible to<br>
determine the present deuterium concentration inside the reaction chamber 1a.<br>
Thus, according to the treatment method for an optical fiber in mis embodiment,<br>
there are no dangers such as explosions, and thereby it is possible to control the<br>
deuterium concentration correctly even when the composition ratios of the base gas (the<br>
deuterium containing gas) inside the reaction chamber 1 a fluctuate.<br>
In addition, in the treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment,<br>
preferably the reaction chamber 1a is a sealed container, If the reaction chamber 1a is a<br>
sealed container, before carrying out the deuterium treatment for the optical fiber 2 inside<br>
the reaction chamber 1a, a reduced pressure atmosphere can be created inside the<br>
reaction chamber 1a.<br>
Furthermore, in the treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment,<br>
preferably the deuterium treatment of the optical fiber 2 is carried out after a reduced<br>
pressure atmosphere has been created inside the reaction chamber 1 a.<br>
In this embodiment, a method will be exp1ained in which the deuterium<br>
treatment of the optical fiber 2 is carried out after a reduced pressure atmosphere has<br>
been created inside the reaction chamber 1a.<br>
After p1acing the optical fiber 2 inside the reaction chamber 1a of the treatment<br>
apparatus 1 and activating the discharge pump 1g, which is a vacuum pump, the<br>
discharge opening and closing valve 1f is opened, a reduced pressure atmosphere is<br>
created inside the reaction chamber 1a, that is, inside the space accommodating the<br>
optical fiber 2. by discharging the air inside the reaction chamber 1 a, and thereby the<br>
optical fiber 2 is exposed to the reduced pressure atmosphere.<br>
Next, after providing a state of constant temperature within a range of 5°C to<br>
40°C by adjusting the temperature inside the reaction chamber 1 a, the gas inlet opening<br>
and closing valve 1c is opened and the deuterium containing gas is supplied into the<br>
reduced pressure atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1 a. Subsequently, the<br>
deuterium containing gas is supplied until the inside of the reaction chamber 1a reaches a<br>
predetermined pressure and the atmosphere in the space inside the reaction chamber 1a<br>
that accommodates the optical fiber 2 is rep1aced by the deuterium containing gas.<br>
Then the inside of the reaction chamber 1a is sealed by closing the gas inlet opening and<br>
closing valve 1c, and the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the deuterium containing gas<br>
atmosphere in this reaction chamber 1 a.<br>
In this maimer, it is possible to make the dispersion rate of the deuterium<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a high by creating a reduced pressure<br>
atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a that accommodates the optical fiber 2 and<br>
supplying the denterium containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a in mis reduced<br>
pressure state. Thereby, even when the optical fiber 2 has been wound around a bobbin<br>
3, the deuterium containing gas passes through minute gaps between the wound optical<br>
fiber 2 and spreads quickly into proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3. Therefore,<br>
the probability of contact between the optical fiber 2 in proximity to the coil core of the<br>
bobbin 3 and the deuterium containing gas can be made high. Thus, it is possible to<br>
apply the deuterium treatment sufficiently (evenly) throughout the entire length of the<br>
optical fiber 2.<br>
In addition, this third embodiment of the treatment method for an optical fiber<br>
can be applied even when the measured gas is hydrogen other than deuterium or a gas<br>
other than oxygen, such as nitrogen. (Applicants may choose to list additional gases<br>
here for broader disclosure and possible subject thatter for additional dependent<br>
c1aim(s).J<br>
Next, a fourth embodiment of the treatment method for an optical fiber<br>
according to the invention will be exp1ained with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
The treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment, which annihi1ates<br>
the NBOHCs using a hydrogen treatment, is for inhibiting an increase in the transmission<br>
loss in the optical fiber after being laid.<br>
In the treatment method for an optical fiber of this embodiment, first, an optical<br>
fiber 2 having a predetermined length is wound around a bobbin 3.<br>
Next, the optical fiber 2 that has been wound around the bobbin 3 is p1aced<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a of the treatment apparatus 1.<br>
Next, after closing the discharge opening and closing valve 1f, the temperature<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is maintained at a state of constant temperature within a<br>
range of 5°Cto 40°C by adjusting the temperature therein by using a temperature<br>
adjusting means (not shown), a thermometer (not shown), or a temperature adjusting<br>
portion (not shown).<br>
Next, the gas inlet opening and closing valve 1c is opened, the hydrogen<br>
containing gas is supplied into the reaction chamber 1a, and the optical fiber 2 is exposed<br>
to the hydrogen containing gas atmosphere in the reaction chamber 1a while control is<br>
carried out so that the hydrogen concentration in the hydrogen containing gas atmosphere<br>
in this reaction chamber 1 a remains constant.<br>
In this embodiment, in the hydrogen treatment step described above, first the<br>
concentration β of the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a<br>
is measured. Next, the concentration γ of the oxygen in the hydrogen containing gas<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is measured. The hydrogen concentration 5 in the<br>
reaction chamber 1a during the hydrogen treatment is calcu1ated from the results of these<br>
measurements and the initial value a of the hydrogen concentration in the hydrogen<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a (treatment chamber) using the following<br>
EQ. 2. Based on the calcu1ated hydrogen concentration 5, the hydrogen concentration<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a is maintained at a concentration necessary to carry out the<br>
hydrogen treatment of the optical fiber 2 inside the reaction chamber 1a sufficiently.<br>
Specifically, in the case in which the hydrogen concentration inside the reaction chamber<br>
1a does not reaoh the concentration required for the hydrogen treatment, the gas inlet<br>
opening and closing valve 1c is opened and the hydrogen containing gas is supplied into<br>
the reaction chamber 1a. In contrast, in the case in which the hydrogen concentration<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1a exceeds the concentration required for the hydrogen<br>
treatment, the gas inlet opening and closing valve lc is closed and the supply of the<br>
hydrogen containing gas into the reaction chamber 1a is stopped.<br>
δ-α*(1-γ/p) EQ.2<br>
where 8 indicates a hydrogen concentration inside the treatment chamber during the<br>
hydrogen treatment, a indicates an initial value of the hydrogen concentration in the<br>
hydrogen containing gas inside the treatment chamber, (3 indicates concentration of<br>
oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (air) of the treatment chamber, and y indicates<br>
concentration of oxygen in the hydrogen containing gas inside the treatment chamber.<br>
An oxygen densitometer (not shown) was used to measure the concentration β<br>
of the oxygen in the ambient atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a and the<br>
concentration γ of the oxygen in the hydrogen containing gas in the reaction chamber 1 a.<br>
Examples of oxygen densitometers that can be used are Toray's LC-750 and Yokogawa's<br>
oxygen densitometer 0X61.<br>
In this manner, the amount of air mixed into the atmosphere of the reaction<br>
chamber 1 a is calcu1ated by measuring the concentration β of the oxygen in the ambient<br>
atmosphere (air) of the reaction chamber 1a and the concentration 7 of the oxygen in the<br>
hydrogen containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1a, and it is possible to calcu1ate the<br>
present hydrogen concentration inside the reaction chamber 1a from these calcu1ated<br>
values. Because there are dangers such as explosions and the like when the gas used in<br>
the treatment of the optical fiber is an inf1ammable gas (hydrogen) as in the hydrogen<br>
treatment, in terms of control, measurement of the hydrogen concentration using a<br>
conventional combustion densitometer or an optical densitometer is not preferable.<br>
Thus, in the case in which hydrogen containing gas is used as the gas that serves as the<br>
base, the present hydrogen concentration inside the reaction chamber 1 a is calcu1ated by<br>
measuring the concentration of the air, and in particu1ar, the oxygen, mixed in the<br>
hydrogen containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1 a. The reason for this is that a<br>
cause of the hydrogen concentration becoming low is the air mixed into the hydrogen<br>
*<br>
containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1 a during the hydrogen treatment Therefore,<br>
it is possible to determine the amount (concentration) of air (oxygen) that has mixed into<br>
the hydrogen containing gas inside the reaction chamber 1 a, and thereby it is possible to<br>
determine the present hydrogen concentration inside the reaction chamber 1a.<br>
Thereby, according to the treatment method for an optical fiber in this<br>
embodiment, mere are no dangers such as explosions, and thereby it is possible to control<br>
the hydrogen concentration correctly even when the composition ratios of the gas serving<br>
as the base (the hydrogen containing gas) inside the reaction chamber 1 a fluctuate.<br>
In addition, in the treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment,<br>
preferably the reaction chamber 1 a is a sealed container. If the reaction chamber 1 a is a<br>
sealed container, before carrying out the hydrogen treatment of the optical fiber 2 inside<br>
the reaction chamber 1a, a reduced pressure atmosphere can be created inside the<br>
reaction chamber 1a.<br>
Furthermore, in the treatment method for an optical fiber in this embodiment,<br>
preferably the hydrogen treatment of the optical fiber 2 is carried out after a reduced<br>
pressure atmosphere has been created inside the reaction chamber 1a.<br>
In this embodiment, a method will be exp1ained in which the hydrogen treatment<br>
of the optical fiber 2 is carried out after a reduced pressure atmosphere has been created<br>
inside the reaction chamber 1 a.<br>
After p1acing the optical fiber 2 inside the reaction chamber 1a of the treatment<br>
apparatus 1 and activating the discharge pump 1g, which is a vacuum pump, the<br>
discharge opening and closing valve 1f is opened, and a reduced pressure atmosphere is<br>
created inside of the reaction chamber 1a, that is, inside the space accommodating the<br>
optica] fiber 2, by discharging the air inside the reaction chamber 1a, and the optical fiber<br>
2 is exposed in the reduced pressure atmosphere.<br>
Next, after providing a state of constant temperature within a range of 5°C to<br>
40°C by adjusting the temperature inside the reaction chamber 1 a, the gas inlet opening<br>
and closing valve 1 c is opened and the hydrogen containing gas is supplied into the<br>
reduced pressure atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1 a. Subsequently, the<br>
hydrogen containing gas is supplied until the inside of the reaction chamber 1a reaches a<br>
predetermined pressure and the atmosphere in the space inside the reaction chamber 1a<br>
that accommodates the optical fiber 2 is rep1aced by the hydrogen containing gas. Then<br>
the inside of the reaction chamber 1a is sealed by closing the gas inlet opening and<br>
closing valve 1c, and in this reaction chamber 1a, the optical fiber 2 is exposed to the<br>
hydrogen containing gas atmosphere.<br>
In mis manner, it is possible to make the dispersion rate of the hydrogen<br>
containing gas inside the reaction ohamber 1 a high by creating a reduced pressure<br>
atmosphere inside the reaction chamber 1a that accommodates the optical fiber 2 and<br>
supplying the hydrogen containing gas into the reaction chamber 1a in this reduced<br>
pressure state. Thereby, even when the optical fiber 2 has been wound around the<br>
bobbin 3, the hydrogen containing gas passes through minute gaps between the wound<br>
optical fiber 2 and spreads quickly into proximity to the coil core of the bobbin 3.<br>
Therefore, the probability of contact between the optical fiber 2 in proximity to the coil<br>
core of the bobbin 3 and the hydrogen containing gas can be made high. Thus, it is<br>
possible to apply the hydrogen treatment sufficiently (evenly) throughout the entire<br>
length of the optical fiber 2.<br>
Below, the invention will be exp1ained in greater detail by using an experimental<br>
example. However, the invention is not limited by the following experimental example.<br>
Experimental Example<br>
An apparatus identical to the optical fiber optical fiber treatment apparatus<br>
shown in FIG. 1 was used to apply the deuterium treatment to an optical fiber.<br>
The deuterium treatment for an optical fiber was repeated; the deuterium<br>
concentration in the reaction chamber was measured each time by an optical<br>
densitometer (Riken Measuring Instruments, FI-21); the oxygen concentration in the<br>
reaction chamber was measured by using an oxygen densitometer (Toray, LO750H); and<br>
gas chrothatography of the deuterium inside the reaction chamber was carried out,<br>
The deuterium gas used a nitrogen gas as the base.<br>
The results of the measurements are shown in FIG, 5.<br>
In FIG. 5, the deuterium concentration (calcu1ated value, indicated by the<br>
rhombic symbols) denotes the value calcu1ated from the oxygen concentration inside the<br>
reaction chamber measured in this experimental example and EQ. 1 described above. In<br>
addition, the deuterium concentration (analytic value, indicated by the triangu1ar<br>
symbols) denotes the value obtained from the gas chrothatography analysis in the present<br>
experimental example. Furthermore, the oxygen concentration (measured value,<br>
indicated by the square symbols) denotes the value of the oxygen concentration inside the<br>
reaction chamber measured in the present experimental example,<br>
From the results shown in HO. 5, it has been confirmed that, like the case in<br>
which the deuterium inside the reaction chamber is analyzed by gas chrothatography, the<br>
deuterium concentration can be measured easily by finding the deuterium concentration<br>
in the reaction chamber from the values of the oxygen concentration in the reaction<br>
chamber measured by the oxygen densitometer using EQ. 1 described above.<br>
The treatment method for an optical fiber of the invention can be applied when<br>
using treatment gases other men deuterium or hydrogen<br>
