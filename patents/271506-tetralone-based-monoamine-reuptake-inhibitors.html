The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to compounds and compositions for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Psychiatric disorders are pathological conditions of the brain characterized by identifiable symptoms that result in abnormalities in cognition  emotion, mood, or affect. These disorders may vary in severity of symptoms, duration, and functional impairment. Psychiatric disorders afflict millions of people worldwide resulting in tremendous human suffering and economic burden due to lost productivity and dependent care.<br>
[0003] Over the past several decades, the use of pharmacological agents to treat psychiatric disorders has greatly increased, largely due to research advices in both neuroscience and molecular biology. In addition, chemists have become increasingly sophisticated at creating chemical compounds that are more effective therapeutic agents with fewer side effects,<br>
[0004] Yet, despite the many advances that have occurred, many psychiatric diseases remain untreated or inadequately treated with current pharmaceutica1 agents. In addition, many of the current agents interact with molecular targets not involved with the psychiatric disease. This indiscriminate binding can result in side effects that c^n greatly influence the overall outcome of therapy. In some cases the side effects are so severe that discontinuation of therapy is required.<br>
[0005] Depression is an affective disorder, the pathogenesis Of which cannot be explained by any single cause or theory. It is characterized by a persisoent|y low mood or diminished interests in one's surroundings, accompanied by at least several of the following symptoms: reduced energy and motivation, difficulty concentrating, altered sleep and appetite, and at times, suicidal ideation (American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ed. . Washington, American Psychiatric Association,). Major depression is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality* with suicide rates of-% (Kaplan H I, Sadock B J (eds): Synopsis of Psychiatry. Baltimore, Williams &amp; Wilkins,, p.).<br>
2<br><br>
[0006] Depression is believed to result from dysfunction in the noradrenergic or serotonergic systems, more specifically, from a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters (NTs) at functionally important adrenergic or serotonergic receptors.<br>
[0007] Neurotransmitters produce their effects as a consequence of interactions with specific receptors. Neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine (NE) and/or serotonin (-hydroxytryptamine, or -HT), are synthesized in brain neuron  and stored in vesicles. Upon a nerve impulse, NTs are released into the synaptic cleft, where they interact with various postsynaptic receptors. Regional deficiencies in the synaptic levels of -HT and/or NE are believed to be involved in the etiology of depression, wakefulness, and attention.<br>
[0008] Norepinephrine is involved in regulating arousal, dreaming, and moods. Norepinephrine can also contribute to the regulation of blood pressure, by constricting blood vessels and increasing heart rate.<br>
[0009] Serotonin (-HT) is implicated in the etiology or treatment of various disorders. The most widely stud'ied effects of -HT are those on the CNS- The functions of -rTi are numerous and include control of appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature regulation, mood, behavior (including sexual and hallucinogenic behavior), cardiovascular function, smooth muscle contraction, and endocrine regulation. Peripherally, -HT appears to play a major role in platelet homeostasis and motility of the G1 tract. The actions of-HT are terminated by three major mechanisms: diffusion; metabolism; and reuptake. The major mechanism by which the action of -HT is terminated is by reuptake through presynaptic membranes. After -HT acts on its various postsynaptic receptors, it is removed from the synaptic cleft back into the nerve terminal through an uptake mechanism involving a specific membrane transporter in a manner similar to that of other biogenic amines. Agents that selectively inhibit this uptake increase the concentration of -HT at the postsynaptic receptors and have been found to be useful in treating various psychiatric disorders, particularly depression,<br>
[0010] Approaches to the treatment of depression over the years have involved the use of agents that increase the levels of NE and -HT, either by inhibiting their metabolism {e.g., monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or reuptake {e.g., tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)).<br>
3<br><br>
[0011] There are more than twenty 0 approved antidepressant drugs available in the United States. The classical tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) currently available block primarily the uptake of NE and also, to varying degrees, the uptake of-HT, depending on whether they are secondary or tertiary amines. Tertiary amines such as imipramine and amitriptyline are more selective inhibitors of the uptake of-HT than of catecholamines, compared with secondary amines such as desipramine.<br>
[0012] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been investigated as potential antidepressants. Fluoxetine (PROZAC®), sertraline (ZOLOFT®), and paroxetine (PAXIL®) are three examples of SSRIs currently on the U.S. market. These agents do not appear to possess greater efficacy than the TCAs, nor do they generally possess a faster onset of action; however, they do have the advantage of causing less side-effects. Of these three SSRIs, paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of -HT uptake, fluoxetine the least. Sertaline is the most selective for -HT versus NE uptake, fluoxetine the least selective. Fluoxetine and sertraline produce active metabolites, while paroxetine is metabolized to inactive metabolites. The SSRIs, in general, affect only the uptake of serotonin and display little or no affinity for various receptor systems including muscarinic, adrenergic, dopamine, and histamine receptors.<br>
[0013] In addition to treating depression, several other potential therapeutic applications for SSRIs have been investigated. They include treatment of Alzheimer's disease, aggressive behavior, premenstrual syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and alcohol abuse. For example, fluoxetine is approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Of particular significance is the observation that -HT reduces food consumption by increasing meal-induced satiety and reducing hunger, without producing the behavioral effects of abuse liability associated with amphetamine-like drugs.. Thus, there is interest in the use of SSRIs in the treatment of obesity.<br>
[0014] Venlafaxine (EFFEXOR®) is a dual-reuptake antidepressant that differs from the classical TCAs and the SSRIs chemically and pharmacologically in that it acts as a potent inhibitor of both -HT and NE uptake. Neither venlafaxine nor its major metabolite have a significant affinity for adrenergic alpha- receptors. Venlafaxine possesses an efficacy equivalent to that of the TCAs, and a benign side effect profile similar to those of the SSRIs.<br>
4<br><br>
[0015] Dopamine is hypothesized to play a major roie in psychosis and certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, where a deficiency in dopaminergic neurons is believed to be the underlying pathology. Dopamine affects brain processes that control movement, emotional response, and ability to experience pleasure and pain. Regulation of DA plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Certain drugs increase DA concentrations by preventing DA reuptake, leaving more DA in the synapse. An example is methylphenidate (RITALIN®), used therapeutically to treat childhood hyperkinesias and symptoms of schizophrenia. Dopamine abnormalities are believed to underlie some of the core attentional abnormalities seen in acute schizophrenics.<br>
[0016] A therapeutic lag is associated with the use of these drugs. Patients must take a drug for at least three () weeks before achieving clinically meaningful symptom relief. Furthermore, a significant number of patients do not respond to current therapies at all. For example, it is currently estimated that up to thirty percent (%) of clinically diagnosed cases of depression are resistant to all forms of drug therapy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Definitions<br>
[0029] The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C-C means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyi, (eyelohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, -propenyl, crotyl, -isopentenyl, -(butadienyl),,-pentadienyl, -(,-pentadienyl), ethynyl, - and -propynyl, -butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. The term "alkyl," unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined in more detail below, such as "heteroalkyl." Alkyl groups that are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed "homoalkyl".<br>
[0030] The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified, but not limited, by -CHCHCHCH-, and further includes those groups described below as "heteroalkylene." Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from to carbon atoms, with those groups having or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a = shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
[0031] The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.<br>
8<br><br>
[0032] The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quatemized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH-CH-O-CH, -CH-CH-NH-CH, -CH-CH-N(CH)-CH, -CH-S-CH-CH, -CH-CH,-S(0)-CH, -CH-CH-S(0)-CH, -CH-CH-O-CH, -Si(CH), -CH-CH=N-OCH, and -CH=CH-N(CH)-CH. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH-NH-OCH and -CH-O-Si(CH). Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH-CH-S-CH-CH- and -CH-S-CH-CH-NH-CH-. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -COR'- represents both -C(0)OR' and -OC(0)R[0033] The terms "cycloalkyP and "heterocycloalkyl", by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, -cyclohexenyl, -cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, -(,,,-tetrahydropyridyl), -piperidinyl, -piperidinyl, -piperidinyl, -morpholinyl, -morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran--yl, tetrahydrofuran--yl, tetrahydrothien-yl, tetrahydrothien-yl, -piperazinyl, -piperazinyl, and the like.<br>
[0034] The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl.   For<br>
9<br><br>
example, the term "halo(C-C)alkyP' is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, ,,-trifluoroethyl, -chlorobutyl, -bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0035] The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, substituent that can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from to rings), which 'are fused together or linked covalently. The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, S, Si and B, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, -naphthyl, -naphthyl, -biphenyl, -pyrrolyl, -pyrrolyl, -pyrrolyl, -pyrazolyl, -imidazolyl, -imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, -oxazolyl, -oxazolyl, -phenyl-oxazolyl, -oxazolyl, -isoxazolyl, -isoxazolyl, -isoxazolyl, -thiazolyl, -thiazolyl, -thiazolyl, -furyl, -furyl, -thienyl, -thienyl, -pyridyl, -pyridyl, -pyridyl, -pyrimidyl, -pyrimidyl, -benzothiazolyl, purinyl, -benzimidazolyl, -indolyl, -isoquinolyl, -isoquinolyl, -quinoxalinyl, -quinoxalinyl, -quinolyl, and -quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.<br>
[0036] For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, -pyridyloxymethyl, -(-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).<br>
[0037] Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl" and "heteroaryl") are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.<br>
[0038] Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo alkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as "alkyl group substituents," and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not<br>
10<br><br>
limited to: substituted or unsubstituted alky), substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, -OR', =0, =NR', =N-OR% -NR'R", -SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R'", -OC(0)R', -C(0)R\ -COR', -CONR'R", -OC(0)NR'R", -NR"C(0)R', -NR'-C(0)NR"R"\ -NR"C(0)R', -NR-C(NR'R"R"')=NR"", -NR-C(NR'R")=NR"\ -S(0)R', -S(0)R\ -S(0)NR'R'\ -NRSOR', -CN and -NO in a number ranging from zero to (m'+), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R\ R", R"' and R"" each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with - halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or tbioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R'" and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a -, -, or -membered ring. For example, -NR'R" is meant to include, but not be limited to, -pyrroJidinyi and -morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF and -CHCF) and acyl (e.g., -C(0)CH, -C(0)CF, -C(0)CHOCH, and the like).<br>
[0039] Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl<br>
and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as "aryl group substituents." The<br>
substituents are selected from, for example: substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, -OR', O, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R",<br>
-SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R"\ -OC(0)R', -C(0)R\ -COR\ -CONR'R", -OC(0)NR'R", -<br>
NR"C(0)R\	-NR'-C(0)NR"R"\	-NR"C(0)R\	-NR-C(NR,R"R,")=NR"",<br>

Central nervous system disorder includes neurodegenerative diseases such Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. schizophrenia), anxieties, sleep disorders, depression, dementias, movement disorders, psychoses, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder and the like. "Central nervous system disorder" also includes any condition associated with the disorder, such as loss of memory and/or loss of cognition. For instance, a method of treating a neurodegenerative disease would also include treating or preventing loss of neuronal function characteristic of such disease. "Central nervous system disorder" also includes any<br>
16<br><br>
disease or condition that is implicated, at least in part, in monoamine (e.g., norepinephrine) signaling pathways (e.g., cardiovascular disease).<br>
[0058] The term "pain" refers to all categories of pain, including pain that is described in terms of stimulus or nerve response, e.g., somatic pain (normal nerve response to a noxious stimulus) and neuropathic pain (abnormal response of a injured or altered sensory pathway, often without clear noxious input); pain that is categorized temporally, e.g., chronic pain and acute pain; pain that is categorized in terms of its severity, e.g., mild, moderate, or severe; and pain that is a symptom or a result of a disease state or syndrome, e.g., inflammatory pain, cancer pain, AIDS pain, arthropathy, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, cardiac ischaemia, and diabetic neuropathy (see, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. - (Wilson et al.. eds., * ed. ); Williams et al, J. of Med. Chem.: - (), herein each incorporated by reference in their entirety). "Pain" is also meant to include mixed etiology pain, dual mechanism pain, allodynia, causalgia, central pain, hyperesthesia, hyperpathia, dysesthesia, and hyperalgesia.<br>
II*       Introduction<br>
[0059] One strategy to develop effective therapies is the use of broad spectrum antidepressants that simultaneously inhibit the reuptake of more than one biogenic amine, such as serotonin (-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamnine (DA). The rationale for this. approach is based upon clinical and preclinical evidence showing that deficiencies in dopaminergic function can be correlated with anhedonia, which is a core symptom of depression. Baldessarini, R.J., "Drugs and the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Depression and Mania, in Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics - (th ed ) Hardman et. al. eds.<br>
[0060] An advantage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention is their ability to increase synaptic availability of three neurotransmitters, NE, -HT and DA by inhibiting their reuptake from the synaptic cleft. Skolnick and coworkers report on a body of preclinical evidence suggesting that the therapeutic profile of an antidepressant concurrently increasing the synaptic availability of DA, NE and -HT will differ from a compound inhibiting only NE and/or -HT. Skolnick, P.; Popik, P.; Janowsky, A.; Beer, B.; Lippa, A. S. "Antidepressant-like actions of DOV-,: a "triple" reuptake inhibitor," Eur. J. Pharm.,,.<br>
17<br><br>
[0061] For example, Skolnick and coworkers have reported that a compound, DOV , ((+)--(,-dichlorophenyl)--azabicyclo[..]hexane), inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the corresponding human recombinant transporters (IC values of , and nM, respectively). Skolnick, P.; Popik, P.; Janowsky, A.; Beer, B.; Lippa, A. S. "Antidepressant-like actions of DOV-,: a "triple" reuptake inhibitor," Eur. J. Pharm. , , . In addition, DOV , reduces the duration of immobility in the forced swim test (in rats) and also produces a dose-dependent reduction in immobility in the tail suspension test. Skolnick, P.; Popik, P.; Janowsky, A.; Beer, B.; Lippa, A. S., Eur. J. Pharm. ,, . Additional evidence can be found in preclinical data for new triple reuptake inhibitors such as DOV , in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. ,„ wherein DOV , was disclosed as having a significantly greater affinity for the norepinephrine and serotonin uptake sites than the racemic compound, (+)-(,-dichlorophenyl)~azabicyclo[..]hexane.<br>
[0062] Taken together, the preclinical data for compounds such as DOV , indicate that dual or triple reuptake inhibitors may hold potential as novel treatments for depression in the clinic.<br>

B.        Compositions Including Stereoisomers<br>
[0079] Compounds of the invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (-)- and (+)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enanfiomericalVy or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.<br>
[0080] If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as an amino group, or an acidic functional group, such as a carboxyl group, diastereomeric salts may be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished using chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).<br>
[0081] As used herein, the term "enantiomerically enriched" or "diastereomerically enriched"<br>
refers to a compound having an enantiomeric excess (ee) or a diastereomeric excess (de)<br>
23						<br><br>
greater than about %, preferably greater than about % and more preferably greater than about %. In general, higher than about % enantiomeric or diastereomeric purity is particularly preferred, e.g., those compositions with greater than about %, greater than about % and greater than about % ee or de.<br>
[0082] The terms "enantiomeric excess" and "diastereomeric excess" are used interchangeably herein. Compounds with a single stereocenter are referred to as being present in "enantiomeric excess", those with at least two stereocenters are referred to as being present in "diastereomeric excess".<br>
[0083] For example, the term "enantiomeric excess" is well known in the art and is defined as:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The term "enantiomeric excess" is related to the older term "optical purity" in that both are measures of the same phenomenon. The value of ee will be a number from to , zero being racemic and being enantiomerically pure. A compound which in the past might have been called % optically pure is now more precisely characterized by % ee. A % ee reflects the presence of % of one enantiomer and % of the other(s) in the material in question.<br>
[0084] Hence, in one embodiment, the invention provides a composition including a first stereoisomer and at least one additional stereoisomer of a compound of the invention. The first stereoisomer may be present in a diastereomeric or enantiomeric excess of at least about %, preferably at least about % and more preferably at least about %. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the first stereoisomer is present in a diastereomeric or enantiomeric excess of at least about %, at least about %, at least about %, at least about % or at least about .%. Enantiomeric or diastereomeric excess may be determined relative to exactly one other stereoisomer, or may be determined relative to the sum of at least two other stereoisomers. In an exemplary embodiment, enantiomeric or diastereomeric excess is determined relative to all other detectable stereoisomers, which are present in the mixture. Stereoisomers are detectable if a concentration of such stereoisomer in the analyzed mixture can be determined using common analytical methods, such as chiral HPLC.<br>

D.        Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0107] In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions including a compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulae (I) to (IV)) or a pharmaceutics lly acceptable salt or solvate thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, additive, vehicle, diluent or combinations thereof.<br>
[0108] As described in detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for oral administration, e.g., tablets,  drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
33<br><br>
solutions or suspensions), parenteral administration (including intravenous and intramuscular), or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained release formulation. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be specifically formulated for administration transdermally.<br>
[0109] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered orally, parenterally, subcutaneously, transdermally, nasally, or by anal suppository. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be administered using controlled delivery devices.<br>
[0110] Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral and parenteral administration, particularly intramuscular, intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect, without being toxic to the patient. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient.<br>
[0111] In certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins, liposomes, micelle forming agents, e.g., bile acids, and polymeric carriers, e.g., polyesters and polyanhydrides; and a compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a compound of the present invention.<br>
[0112] Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
[0113] Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of<br>
capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, caplets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and<br>
34<br><br>
acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia), each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
[0114] In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, caplets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: 0 fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; 0 binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; 0 humectants, such as glycerol; 0 disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; () solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; () absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; () wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and non-ionic surfactants; 0 absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; 0 lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium Iauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and () coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-shelled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0115J A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylrnethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
35<br><br>
[0116] The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.<br>
[0117] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, ,-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofury] alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0118] Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.<br>
[0119] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters,<br>
36<br><br>
macrocrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0120] Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.<br>
[0121] Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
[0122] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[0123] In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively,<br>
37<br><br>
delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
(0124] Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.Pharmaceutical compositions or unit dosage forms of the present invention in the form of prolonged-action tablets may comprise compressed tablets formulated to release the drug substance in a manner to provide medication over a period of time. There are a number of tablet types that include delayed-action tablets in which the release of the drug substance is prevented for an interval of time after administration or until certain physiological conditions exist. Repeat action tablets may be formed that periodically release a complete dose of the drug substance to the gastrointestinal fluids. Also, extended release tablets that continuously release increments of the contained drug substance to the gastrointestinal fluids may be formed.<br>
[0125] Compounds of the invention can be also administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos and  ,„ „. ,„ ,„ and ,„ each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropy I methyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the compounds of this invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.<br>
38<br><br>
(0126] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.<br>
[0127] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
[0128] Compounds of the present invention may also be formulated as transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms, which forms include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, and th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA ( &amp; ); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms,th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia ()• Transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix type" patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.<br>
[0129] Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms encompassed by this invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied.<br>
39<br><br>
[0130] Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in delivering the active ingredients to the tissue.<br>
[0131] The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.<br>
[0132] When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, . to .% of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[0133] The preparations of the present invention may be given orally and parenterally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, and by intravenous administration. In one embodiment, oral administrations are preferred.<br>
[0134] The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticulare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrastemal injection and infusion.<br>
[0135] The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity<br>
of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide<br>
40<br><br>
thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.<br>
[0136] A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
[0137] In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, intravenous, intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about. mg per kilogram to about mg per kilogram of body weight per day.<br>
[0138] The terms "treatment" or "treating" is intended to encompass therapy, preventing (prophylaxis), preventing relapse, and amelioration of acute symptoms. Note that "treating" refers to either or both of the amelioration of symptoms and the resolution of the underlying condition. In many of the conditions of the invention, the administration of a compound or composition of the invention may act not directly on the disease state, but rather on some pernicious symptom, and the improvement of that symptom leads to a general and desirable amelioration of the disease state<br>
[0139] The patient receiving this treatment is any animal in need, including primates, in particular humans, and other mammals such as equines, cattle, swine and sheep; and poultry and pets in general.<br>
[0140] The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered in conjunction with other pharmaceutical agents, for instance antimicrobial agents, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides. Conjunctive<br>
therapy thus includes sequential, simultaneous and separate administration of the active<br>
41<br><br>
compound in a way that the therapeutic effects of the first administered agent have not entirely disappeared when the subsequent agent is administered.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
General: Determination of Absolute Stereochemistry<br>
[0148] In this application, relative stereochemistries are used unless otherwise indicated. Assignments of relative stereochemistries were made using NMR techniques (determination of cis- and /raws-configurations, optionally using literature reports for similar compounds). Absolute stereochemistries of selected compounds were determined by synthesis of key intermediates from commercially-available (S)-a-tetralone as outlined in Scheme , below. Correlations were made using chiral HPLC analyses. For example, spiking authentic samples into enantiomeric and/or diastereomeric mixtures allowed for a correlation of retention times and structures.<br><br>

The uptake of radiolabeled -HT by synaptosomes ( ug of proteins/point) was allowed by incubating them in a well for  min at °C in presence of test compounds and [H]-hydroxytryptarnine (serotonin;. uCi/point).<br>
[0258] Synaptosomes and [H]serotonin were prepared in a Krebs buffer pH . containing mM NaHCO, mM glucose and uM ascorbic acid. This incubation buffer was oxygenated during minutes before incubation. Basal control was incubated for minutes at °C in order to avoid any uptake. Following this incubation the uptake was stopped by filtration through a unifilter -wells GFB Packard plate washed with Krebs buffer containing mM NaHCO in order to eliminate the free [H]serotonin. The radioactivity associated to the synaptosomes retained on the unifilter corresponding to the uptake was then measured with a microplate scintillation counter (Topcount, Packard) using a scintillation fluid. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of an excess of cold, unlabeled ligand. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding.<br>

HEK- cells expressing human serotonin transporter were plated before the assay. Test compound and/or vehicle was preincubated with cells in modified HEPES buffer pH . or pH . for minutes at to °C and nM [Hjserotonin was then added for an additional timed incubation period (ten to thirty minutes). Ceils with internalized [HJserotonin were washed and the amount of tritium taken into cells is counted using a liquid scintillation counter to determine [H]serotonin uptake. Non-specific binding of tritium was measured in a control reaction containing uM fluoxetine, and was subtracted from the counts for assays to correct for non-specific binding of tritium . Reduction of [H]serotonin uptake by percent or more (&gt;%) relative to an uninhibited control reaction indicates significant inhibitory activity. Compounds were screened at , , ., . and . uM.

The uptake of radiolabeled norepinephrine by synaptosomes ( ug of proteins/point) was allowed by incubating them for minutes at °C in presence of test compounds and [H]-norepinephrine (. uCi/point). The experiment was performed in a deep well.<br>
[0266] Synaptosomes  and  [H]-norepinephrine  were prepared  in  a Krebs  buffer  pH  .<br>
containing  mM NaHCO,  mM glucose and  µM ascorbic acid.  This incubation buffer was<br>
86<br><br>
oxygenated for minutes before incubation. Basal control was incubated for minutes at °C in order to avoid any uptake. Following this incubation, the uptake was stopped by filtration through a unifilter -wells GFB Packard plate washed with Krebs buffer containing mM NaHCO in order to eliminate the free [H]-norepinephrine. The radioactivity associated to the synaptosomes retained onto the unifilter corresponding to the uptake was then measured with a microplate scintillation counter (Topcount, Packard) using a scintillation fluid.<br>
[0267] The reference compound is protriptyline tested at concentrations ranging from " M to " M in order to obtain an IC value. See, Perovics and Muller, "Pharmacological profile of hypericum extract: effect on serotonin uptake by postsynaptic receptors," Arzeim. Forsch./DrugRes.,:- () <br>
Norepinephrine Functional Uptake Assay for Human Reuptake Transporter [0268] Inhibition of human norepinephrine reuptake transporter was assayed using the recombinant human norepinephrine transporter expressed in either HEK or MDCK cells using a published method (Galli A, DePeiice LJ, Duke Bj, Moore KR, BlakeVy RD. Sodium dependent norepinephrine-induced currents in norepinephrine-transporter-transfected HEK-cells blocked by cocaine and antidepressants. J. Exp. Biol.: -,). The cells were plated before the assay. Test compound and/or vehicle was preincubated with cells in modified HEPES buffer pH . or pH . for minutes at to °C. Following the preincubation, nM [Hjnorepinephrine was added for an additional timed incubation period (to minutes). After the cells were washed to remove [Hjnorepinephrine not internalized, the cells were lysed, and the amount of tritium in the cell lysate was measured using a liquid scintillation counter to determine [Hjnorepinephrine uptake. Non-specific binding of tritium was measured in a control reaction containing uM imipramine (or µM nisoxetine), and was subtracted from the counts for assays to correct for non-specific binding of tritium. Reduction of [Hjnorepinephrine uptake by percent or more (&gt;%) relative to an uninhibited control reaction indicates significant inhibitory activity. Compounds were screened at, , ., . and . u,M. The reference compounds for the assay were desipramine and nisoxetine, for which IC values of. nM and . nM respectively were obtained in typical experiments.<br><br>

[0270] In Table , compound numbers correspond to those used in the Schemes and Examples above. In addition, the following abbreviations have been used in Table V. SERT, serotonin transporter; NET, norepinephrine transporter; and DAT, dopamine transporter.<br>
[0271] These results indicate that compounds of the invention exhibit potent inhibition on the' neuronal uptake of NE, DA, and/or -HT, and compare favorably with potencies seen for various existing therapeutic agents. For example, reported potencies (IC or K; values) of approved and launched drugs include: fluoxetine (PROZAC*8), nM for inhibition of human -HT reuptake transporter; methylphenidate (RITALIN®), nM and nM for inhibition of human dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters respectively; amitriptyline (ELAVIL®), and nM for inhibition of the human norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake transporters respectively, and venlafaxine (EFFEXOR®, a so-called serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or SNRI) and nM, for inhibition of the human serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake transporters respectively. The multiple inhibition of the neuronal uptake of NE, DA and/or -HT displayed by the compounds of the invention provides the clinician with the ability to more effectively treat CNS disorders, including without limitation affective disorders, cerebral function disorders, anxiety disorders, neuropathic pain, and migraine or migraine headache, by elevating various monoamine levels in the brain simultaneously and over the same dose-range without the need to titrate separate drugs.<br>
