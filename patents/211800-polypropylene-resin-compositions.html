Polypropylene resin compositions<br>
The present invention relates to polypropylene resin compositions having excellent crystallizability, high transmittance, high clarity, low haze and improved thermal stability, and containing trimesic acid derivatives, to the use of these trimesic acid derivatives as haze reducing agents, to mixtures of trimesic acid derivatives and to novel trimesic acid derivatives.<br>
Polypropylene resin is widely applied in a variety of areas as the material of choice for film molding, sheet molding, blow molding, injection molding, and the like, because of its excellent processability and mechanical and electrical properties. Although the resin has a number of very useful characteristics, its crystallization behavior and optical properties are unattractive, which result in restricting application of this material, in particular in the packaging industry. Several attempts have been made to improve the crystallizability, transmittance and clarity, and reduce haze of polypropylene, notably by the addition of nucleating agents and clarifiers.<br>
Nucleating agents and clarifiers are commonly used in industrial practice in combination with crystaliizable thermoplastic polymers to reduce processing cycle times or to impart improved physico-chemical characteristics, such as various optical, surface and mechanical properties, as well as to reduce mold shrinkage. Elaborate lists of nucleating agents and clarifiers can be found in, for example, US-A-3,367,926, Plastics Additives Handbook (4th Ed. Hanser, Munich, 1990, p. 863). Typical nucleating agents known in the art are metallic salts of aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids, aromatic salts, metallic salts of aromatic phosphorus compounds, quinacridones, pigments, polymers having melting points, highly branched polymers containing dendritic branches (dendrimers), and minerals such as chalk, gypsum, clay, kaolin, mica, talc and silicates, as well as combinations thereof (US-A-5,278,216, US-A-5,137,973, US-A-4,749,736, US-A-4,694,064, US-A-4,338,228, US-A-3,852,237; U. Johnsen and K.-H. Moos, Angew. Makromol. Chem, vol. 74, p. 1 (1978); A. Wlochowicz and M. Eder, Angew. Makromol. Chem, vol. 171, p. 79 (1989); H. N. Beck, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., vol. 11, p. 673 (1967); F. L Binsbergen, Polymer, vol. 11, p. 253 (1970)). In addition, DE-A-1,951,632 discloses the use of solid, crystalline aromatic carboxilicimide-diphthalimides and N-substituted aromatic carboxylic imide-diphthalimides.<br>
More recently developed nucleating agents and clarifiers dissolve in the polymer melt (R. Schlotmann and R. Walker, Kunststoffe, vol. 86, p. 1002 (1996)), which was found to be effective for improving dispersion of these additives. Most popular have become compounds that are<br><br>
based on D-sorbitol, which belongs to the general chemical family of carbohydrates, that is defined as polyhydroxy aldehydes, polyhydroxy ketones, or compounds that can be hydrolyzed to them (R. T. Morrion and Robert Neilson Boyd, Organic Chemistry, 2nd. Ed., (Aliyn and Bacon, Inc., Boston), 1966, p. 983). There are several commercial nucleators based on sorbitol including 1,3-2,4-di(benzylidene)-D-sorbitol (Millad 3905 (RTM), Milliken Chemical Co. (RTM)); 1,3-2,4-di(4-tolylidene)-D-sorbitol (Millad 3940 (RTM), Milliken Chemical Co. (RTM)); 1,3-2,4-(3,4-dimethy!benzylidene)-D-sorbitoI (Millad 3988 (RTM), Milliken Chemical Co. (RTM)); 1,3-2,4-di(4-ethylbenzylidene)-D-sorbitoI (N-4, Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd. (RTM)). US-A-5,574,174, US-A-5,198,484 and WO-A-95/13317 disclose the preparation and use of sorbitol derivatives. US-A-4,294,747 discloses polyhydric alcohol acetals of benzaldehyde and derivatives thereof. US-A-5,216,051 describes triacetal potyoi compounds. Use of dibenzylidene sorbitol (US-A-4,016,118) in combination with phenyl phosphate compounds is disclosed in US-A-4,585,817. Despite wide-spread commercial application, there exist a number of difficulties that are associated with carbohydrate-based compounds as nucleating and clarifying agents. First, the preparation and purification of sorbitol-based nucleating agents is cumbersome. Another of the well-known difficulties associated with the use of sorbitol clarifying agents in, for example, polyolefins resins is the formation of small bubbles in articles fabricated from these resins, which appear as white points (US-A-5,198,484). Finally, among other disadvantages is their unsatisfactory temperature stability that is inherent to this class of materials.<br>
The above compounds are either ineffective in simultaneously improving crystallizability and transmittance and clarity and haze of polypropylene resin, or exhibit insufficient heat resistance during processing, which is undesirable and may cause degradation and/or sublimation of the additive and promote degradation of the polymer.<br>
Thus, a demand for further improvement of nucleating agents and clarifiers continues to exist.<br>
JP-A-Hei 7/ 278,374 describes a polypropylene resin composition containing tricarballytic acid-type amide compounds and having high crystallization temperature and improved transparency.<br>
Several trimesic acid derivatives are known in the art, and their use as nucleating agents for polypropylene resins has been suggested for example in EP-A-940,431. Although principally directed to enhancement of rigidity of polypropylene resin, in JP-A-Hei06/192,496 it has been suggested that these compounds may impart improved transparency. However, no mention is<br><br>
made or suggested of improved transmittance or claR1ty or reduced haze, which are entirely different properties, and not naturally and necessaR1ly are synonymous with improved transparency. As background, it is noted that haze determines the turbidity, and claR1ty the resolution or sharpness of the image of an object that is placed behind a film or plaque of the resin, while transmittance is associated with the amount of light that reaches the observer.<br>
It has not been taught in the art, which among the enormous vaR1ety of tR1mesic acid deR1vatives known as nucleating agents for polypropylene resins enhance the transmittance, which ones improve claR1ty, which ones reduce haze and which compounds simultaneously impart all of these highly desirable properties to polypropylene.<br>

The general procedures used in the Working Examples 1 to 4 are descRibed below.<br>
Mixing Procedure:<br>
To 59.91 g of powdered polypropylene (ELF-Atochem (RTM); Appryl 3030BN1(RTM)) 90 mg of a powdered additive (0.15 % by weight) or a powdered mixture of additives (total 0.15 % by weight) is added, and tumble-mixed for 24 h in a glass container. In general, 4.5 g of this mixture are compounded at 239 °C in a small-scale, laboratory twin-screw, recirculating and corotating extruder, for example the MicroCompounder of DACA Instruments (RTM), for a peRiod of about 4 min at a screw speed of 40 rpm, and subsequently collected at room temperature. The neat polypropylene is similarly treated to produce a blank control sample.<br>
Differential Scanning CaloRimetrv (DSC):<br>
A Perkin-Elmer DSC instrument (RTM) (Model DSC 7), operated in a dry nitrogen atmosphere, is used for the analysis of the crystallization behavior of the vaRious mixtures and control samples, according to standard procedures. About 5 to 10 mg of sample is sealed into an aluminum cup, heated from 130°C to 230°C at a rate of 10°C/min, held at 230°C for 5 min, and then subsequently cooled at a rate of 10°C/min to 50 °C. The data represented as crystallization<br><br>
temperatures are the peak temperatures of the exotherrns in the thermograms that are recorded upon cooling.<br>
Thermo-GravimetRic Analysis (TGA), Differential Thermal Analysis fDTA): An automated Netzsch TGA/DTA instrument (STA 409) (RTM) operated in nitrogen is used for the analysis of the thermal stability and the melting temperature. As melting temperatures the peak maximum of the endothermic transition are presented. About 10 mg of sample is placed into an aluminum oxide crucible and heated from 50 °C to 640 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.<br>
Injection molding:<br>
The injection molding is performed with a Microlnjector (DACA Instruments (RTM)). About 3.0 g of the pelletized thread is placed under a nitrogen blanket in the barrel at 260 °C. After the granulate is completely molten, the melt is injected into a polished mold with a pressure of about 8 bar. The mold temperature is 20 °C. The collected test specimen has a diameter of 2.5 cm and a thickness of about 1,1-1.2 mm.<br>
Optical CharacteRization (Transmission, ClaRity, Haze):<br>
Transmission, claRity and haze are measured with a haze-gard plus instrument (BYK, Gardner (RTM), illumination CIE-C) at room temperature. The haze-gard plus instrument conforms to ASTM D-1003. The transmission, claRity and haze values are measured between 12-24 hours after obtaining the samples by injection molding.<br>
