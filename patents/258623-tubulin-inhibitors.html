TUBULIN INHIBITORS <br>
FI1LD OF TH1 INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of suppressing the growth of cancels and other proliferative diseases by the administration of compounds that act by binding to tubulin and to novel heterocyclic compounds suitable for such administration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are many human and veterinary diseases that stem from processes of uncontrolled or abnormal cellular proliferation. Most important among these diseases is cancer, the generic name given to a broad range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated growth and lack of differentiation Psoriasis is another disease that is characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cellular proliferation. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease characterized by the presence of dry scales and plaques. The disease results fromhyperprbliferation of the epidermis and incomplete differentiation of keratinocytes. Psoriasis often involves the scalp, elbows, knees, back, buttocks, nails, eyebrows, and genital regions, and may rangejn severity from mild to extremely debilitating, resulting mpsoriatic arthritis,.pustular psoriasis, and exfoliative psoiiatie dermatitis. There is, at present, no general therapeutic cure mat exists for psoriasis; Whilst milder cases are often treated with topical cortieosteroids, more severe cases may be treated with antiproliferative agents, such as the antknetabqlite methdtrexate, the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, and the microtubule disrupter colchicine.<br>
Other diseases associated with an abnormally high level of cellular proliferation include<br>
restenosis, where vascular smooth muscle cells are involved; inflammatory disease states,<br>
where endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and glomerular cells are involved; myocardial<br>
infractin,where heart musscle cells are glomerular cell are involved;and infectious<br>
are involved; transplant rejection, where endothelial cells are involved; and infectious<br>
diseases such as HIV infection and malaria, where certain immune cells and/or other<br>
infected cells are involved.<br>
Inhibition of cellular proliferation can be brought about by several mechanisms, including; alkylatirig; agents; topoisomerase inhibitors; riucleotide analogues; antibiotics; hormone antagonisfe; and nucleic add damaging agents; inter alia. One pharmacologically important mechanismof inhibiting ceEular.profileration is by means of<br>

binding tubulin. Tubulin is an asymmetric dimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, that polymerizes to form structural components of the cytoskeleton called microtubules. Microtubules must be highly dynamic in order to carry out many of their functions. At certain stages of the cell cycle, or in particular cell types or organelles, stable microtubules are required, such as for transport within axons or for ciliary and flagellar movement. Micro-tubules assemble during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and participate in the formation of the mitotic spindle which facilitates the segregation of sister chromatids during the process of cell division. The essential role of microtubules in cell division and the ability of drugs that interact with tubulin to interfere with the cell cycle have made tubulin a successful target for applications that include anti-cancer drugs, fungicides, and herbicides. Typical tubulin ligands such as colchicine, paclitaxel, the Vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, the epothilones, the halicondrins, benomyl and mebendazole directly inhibit cell division by binding to tubulin which leads to the arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M boundary of mitosis. This mechanism is the basis of the therapeutic value of compounds of this type, such as treating gout with colchicine, restenosis -with paclitaxel, cancer with paclitaxel, vinblastine, epothilones and halichondrins, and fuungal infections with benomyl and malaria and helminths with mebendazole.<br>
Interfering with microtubule dynamics or stability can inhibit cell divisioxi in several ways. Both stablilizing microtubules or inhibiting their polymerization will prevent the cytoskeleton restructuring that is required at several points in the cell cycle and lead to an arrest of the cell's progression from one stage in the cell cycle to the next. Three main classes of tubuiin-binding drugs, namely colchicine analogues, Vinca alkaloids, and the taxanes, have been identified, each of which possesses a specific binding site on the |3-tubulin molecule. Paclitaxel (Taxolâ„¢) and related taxanes represent a class of drugs that stabilize microtubules, a process that ultimately leads to the "freezing" of the microtubule structures so that they cannot be restructured (Jordan M A. and Wilson L., 1998). Subsequent arrest at mitosis induces the apoptotic mechanism to cause cell death. A number of colchicine analogues,as well as several other compounds that bind to the same<br>
site on p-tubulin as colchicine disrupt tubulin polymerization and disrupt microtubular formation. Vinblastine and several other vinca-related drugs bind to a site that is distinct from the colchicine site. Gompoundsthat bind at the Vinca-site prevent microtubule formation and destabilize microtubules (Jordan et al, 1986; Rai and Wolff (1996). This invention is therefore directed to compounds that potentially modulate inicrotubule dynamics by binding to tubulin;<br>

Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide compounds which are directly or indirectly toxic to actively dividing cells and are useful in the treatment of cancer, viral and bacterial infections, vascular restenosis, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, or psoriasis. The present invention is also directed to therapeutic compositions for treating said conditions. Further aspects of the invention are to provide methods for killing actively proliferating'cells, such as cancerous, bacterial, or epithelial cells, and treating all types of cancers, infections, inflammatory, and generally proliferative conditions. A further aspect relates to provide methods for treating other medical conditions characterized by the presence of rapidly proliferating cells, such as psoriasis and other skin disorders.<br>

36. EXAMPLES<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
Compounds are generally prepared in a 2-step process starting from a dihaloheterocycle.<br>
The first step is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate a monoamino-monohalo intermediate.<br>
The nucleophilic aromatic substitution is typically carried out by addition of a primary or secondary amine to the di-halogenated heterocycle in a solvent such1 as ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, dioxane, THF, DMF, ethoxyethanbl, toluene or xylene. The reaction is typically performed at elevated temperature in the presence of excess amine or a non-nucleophilic base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylarnine, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the amino substituent may be introduced through a transition metal catalysed, amination reaction. Typical catalysts for such transformations include Pd(OAc)2/P(t-Bu)3, Pd2(dba)3/B1NAP and Pd(OAc)2/BINAP. These reactions are typically carried out in solvents such as toluene or dioxane/ in the presence of bases such as caesium carbonate or sodium or potassium tert-butoxide at temperatures ranging from room temperature to reflux.<br>
The amines employed in the first step of the synthesis of these compounds are obtained commercially or are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Of particular interest are a-alkylbenzylamines which may be prepared through reduction of oximes. Typical reductants include HMum aluminium hydride&gt; hydrogen gas in the<br>
presence of palladium on charcoal catalyst, Zn in the presence of hydrochloric acid,<br>
sodium borohydride in the presence of a Lewis acid such as TiCl3&gt; ZrCl^ NiCl2 andMoO3, or sodium borohydride in conjunction with Amberlyst H15 ion exchange resin and liCl.<br>
a-Alkylben2ylarnines may also be prepared by reductive amination of the corresponding<br>
 ketbriesr A classical methodfor such a transformation is the Leuckart-Wallach reaction,<br>
 thotigh catalytic conditions (HGO2NH^;[(CH3)5CsRhGl2]2)or alternative procedures (e.g.<br>
 NEiiOAc, Na(GN)BHfe) can also beiused.?	.	<br>

WO 2005/054199	PCT7AU2004/001689<br>
37.<br>
a-Alkylbenzylamines may also be prepared from the corresponding a-alkylbenzyl alcohols. Such methods include derivatisation of the hydroxyl as a mesylate or tosylate and displacement with a nitrogen nucleophile, such as phthalimide or azide which is converted to the primary amine using conventional synthetic methods; or, displacement of the hydroxyl with a suitable nitrogen nucleophile under Mitsunobu-like conditions, a -Alkylbenzyl alcohols can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding ketones with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. Alternatively/ a-alkylbenzyl alcohols can be obtained through addition of an alkyl metal species (such as a Grignard reagent) to abenzaldehyde derivative, typically performed at room temperature or below insolvents such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
a-Alkyl benzylamines of high optical purity may be prepared from chiral a-alkyl benzyl alcohols using the methods outlined above. The chiral a-alkyl benzyl alcohols may be obtained through chiral reduction of the corresponding ketones. Chiral reducing methods are now well known in organic chemistry and include enzymatic processes, asymmetric hydrogenation procedures and chiral oxazaborolidines.<br>
The second step of the synthesis typically involves a palladium mediated cross-coupling of the monoamino-monochloro intermediate with a suitably functionalised coupling partner. Typical coupling partners are boronic adds or esters (Suzuki coupling: see for example Miyaura/N; and Suzuki; Chem Rev. 1995&gt; &amp;S24S7), stannanes (Stille coupling: see for example Stille;J.K., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1986,25,508), Grignard reagents (Kumada coupling: Kumada, M.; Tamao, K.; Sumitani, K. Org. Synth. 1988, Coll. Vol.6, 407.) or organozinc species (Negishi coupling: Negishi, E.;/ Organomet. Chem. 2002,653, 34).<br>
The Suzuki coupling is the preferred coupling method and is typically performed in a solvent such as DME, THF, DMF, ethanol, propanol, toluene, or 1,4-dioxane in the presence-of abase-such as potassium-carbonate, lithium hydroxide, caesiumj:arbjanate,___ sodium hydroxide, potassium fluoride or potassium phosphate. The reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures and the palladium catalyst employed may be selected from Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, [PdCl2(dppf)], Pd2(dba)3/P(t-Bu)3.<br>
-The  products formed from this;reactionsequence may befurtherderivatised using techniques well-khown ;'to those skilled in the art.' Alternatively, derivatisation of the mono-amino mono-halo intermediate may be undertaken prior to displacement of the halo substituent.

For screening purposes, compounds were diluted in 96 well plates at a concentration of 20 jxM. Plates were warmed at 37Â°C for 30 minutes before assay.<br>
. Growth and Maintenance of Cancer Cell lines<br>
K562 (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia), PC3 (Prostate Cancer), and DU145 (Prostate Cancer) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). K562 was grown in RPMI, with 10% FBS with Glutamx added. DUI45 cells were cultured in DMED&gt; with 10% FBS and Glutamx and MEM non-essential amino acids added. PC3 cells were grown in F12K medium, with 10% FBS and Glutamx and MEM non-essential arriino acids added. All cells were grown at 37Â°C in 5% CO2.<br>
Establishment of TEL:JAK cell lines<br>
The coding region encompassing nucleotides 1-487 of TEL was amplified by PCR using<br>
the oligonucleotides 5TEL (5' -GGA GGA TCC TGA TCT CTC TCG CTG TGA GAC-3')<br>
and 3TEL (5'-AGGC GTC GAC TTC TTC TTC ATG GTT CTG-3') and U937 mRNA as<br>
template. A BamH I site was present into the 5TEL Primer, a Sal I site was incorporated<br>
into the 3TEL primer. The regions encompassing the kinase domains of JAK2<br>

The growth factor dependent myelomonocytic cell line BaF3 bearing the pTET-off plasmid (Clontech) was transfected with either pTELJAK2 or pTELJAK3 and the cells selected for factor independent growth. BaF 3 wild type cells were cultured in DMEM 10% PCS, 10% WEHI3B conditioned medium. BaF3 TELJAK cells were cultured in DMEM 10% Tet-System Approved PBS (without WEHI3B conditioned medium).<br>
Cellular assays were performed as follows:<br>
Cell suspensions were prepared by harvesting cells from culture. (Cells used in this test<br>
should be in later log phase growth and high viability.) Cells were diluted in correct<br>
growth medium to l.lx final concentration (from 50000 cell/mL to 200,000 cell/mL,<br>
depending on cell line).		<br>
Compounds to be tested were added (lmL, 1OX final concentration) to a flat bottom<br>
96-well plate. The cellular suspension (90 L per well) was added, and the plate incubated<br>
for 40 hr at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. MTT (20 |iL per well, 5mg/mL in PBS) was added and the<br>
plates were returned to the incubator for a further 6 hours. Lysis buffer (100 ^L per well,<br>
10% SDS, 0.01N HC1) was added and the plate stored in the incubator overnight. The<br>
plate was then read at 590 nm.	<br>
Tubulin Assay<br>
Turbidometric assays of microtubule assembly were performed by incubating microtubule protein in cuvettes at 37 Â°C in a thermostatically controlled spectrophotometer measuring the change in absorbance at 340nm over time. The microtubule protein was incubated with the each test compound at 0 Â°C and polymerisation was initiated by addition of lmM GTP, prior to heating to 37 Â°C.<br>
Results<br>
The activity of a range of compounds is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Compounds that<br>
exhibited a capacity to inhibit greater man 50% of cellular growth at a concentration of , 20uM are designated as "+"; compounds which did not inhibit 50%. of cellular growth at<br>
