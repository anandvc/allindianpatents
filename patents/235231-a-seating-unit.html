The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
SEATING UNIT HAVING MOTION CONTROL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to seating units having motion controls, and more particularly relates to a seating unit* having mechanically non-complex motion control elements, but which are efficient and effective.<br>
Modern chairs often have backs and seats that move upon recline of a person seated in the chairs. More sophisticated chairs include motion control mechanisms to provide sliding and pivoting motions that move in a particular way relative to the seated user so as to provide an optimally comfortable and adjustable chair motion. However, these mechanisms tend to be sophisticated with rigid pivot end slide elements which can result in complex control mechanisms that have many pieces and are difficult to assemble. In turn, the chair becomes expensive. Further, the mechanisms take up space and can become structurally large in size, which is unacceptable for chairs requiring a thin profile or otherwise requiring a clean unobstructed area under their seat. Also, design of these mechanisms is a complex task, with substantial time required to understand and work out competing functional requirements and physical relationships.<br>
Accordingly, a seating unit with motion control mechanism is desired having the aforementioned advantages and solving the aforementioned problems, including having a relatively small, compact mechanism that is flexible and adaptable for different circumstances, and yet that provides a comfortable motion. Alsov a motion control mechanism is desired that is easier to incorporate into chair designs without substantial design time, prototyping, and testing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention includes a seating unit having a base that comprises a motion control mechanism adapted for mounting to the base and further having a central area and a plurality of flexible supports. The flexible supports are flexible in a generally fore-to-aft direction, but stiff in a generally vertical direction, and further the flexible supports have end sections projecting generally outward from said central area. A seat is supported on said end sections of at least one of said flexible supports and a back is pivotally connected to said seat at a first pivot connection and pivotally connected to said end sections of at least one other of said flexible supports wherein said flexible supports flex in said generally fore-to-aft direction to provide synchronous movement of said back and seat.<br><br>

The illustrated support 44 includes three mounting areas 45-47.   A bottom of the central support 44, near middle mounting area 46 (Fig. 8) includes a tapered bottom recess for mateably engaging a top of the pneumatic spring 43.   The mounting areas 45-47 each include an angled surface or slot 45'- 47' for receiving the supports 32.   The illustrated front two angled surfaces 45' and 46' (Fig. 5) face forwardly and are angled rearwardly with respect to vertical about 40° to 50°.  More preferably, the front angled surface 45' extends at about 46° and the middle angled surface 46' extends at about 42°.  The angled surfaces 45' and 46' are nearly parallel, but the middle angled surface 46' has a slightly smaller angle, such that during recline, the end sections 33 of the middle flexible support 32 move upwardly at a slower rate than the end sections 33 of the front flexible support 32. This causes the seat 34 to move translationally and angularly along a predetermined preferred path 48 upon recline, as discussed below.    The angled surface 47' faces rearwardly and is tipped forwardly such that it is at a reverse angle to the front angled surfaces 45' and 46', with the surface 47' being at an angle of about 15° to 25° from vertical (with a 20° angle being preferred). It is noted that the angle of the supports 32 can be changed by using replaceable wedge-shaped spacers, such spacer 145 (Figs. 5-7). However, it is desirable to keep the pivot locations (i.e. bearings 52) at the same locations so that the seat and back paths do not unacceptably change away from the intended design upon recline, and so that the supports 32 do not move and flex in a dramatically different way.<br>
The illustrated flexible supports 32 (Fig. 9) (also called "flexible beams") are planar leaf-spring-like members. The term "flexible" is used herein to define any fore-aft movement, including bending or pivoting, while the term "resilient" is used herein to mean bending along with energy absorption during flexure. Each support 32 includes an enlarged center section 49 attached to the angled surfaces 45'- 47' by fasteners 50, and further includes resiliency flexible arms 51 that taper in height toward the end sections 33 and that are supported on bearings 52. The bearings 52 (Fig. 9) operably receive the outer ends of the arms 51, such that the outer ends can both slip linearly and also rotate as the arms 51 flex and move. It is contemplated that various connecting arrangements can be made for connecting the ends of the arms 51 to the frames of the seat 34 or back 35. For example, a bearing arrangement 100 (Figs. 10A) includes a polymeric stationary support<br><br>
arms can have a variety of shapes. The illustrated flexible supports 32 have a constant thickness, but it is also contemplated that the thickness may be varied along their length to provide a particular force versus deflection curve upon recline. The illustrated flexible supports 32 are made of spring-steel, but they could be made of. reinforced (or nonreinforced) polymeric materials, composite materials, and other materials as well. Accordingly, flexible supports 32 can be manufactured individually out of flat sheet stock (or molded or otherwise individually formed into more complex shapes) or can be molded into a single structure with central support 44. It should also be noted that flexible supports 32 are stiff, yet resilient and store energy upon flexure in the fore-aft direction in the preferred embodiment. Where pretension is applied to the support 32 to assist in holding the chair in a raised position, the support 32 preferably is made of a material that will not creep, such as spring-steel.<br>
Because of the angle of surfaces 45'- 47' and because of the interaction of back frame 60 and seat frame 53 with supports 32, the seat 34 is actually lifted during recline. (Compare Fig. 5 which is the upright position, with Fig. 6, which shows the recline position.) This seat-lifting action helps provide the additionaLenergy necessary when the heavier person reclines. In other words, the energy stored during recline (i.e. due to the seat being lifted) provides some of the energy to assist the seated person when moving from the reclined position toward the upright position. Because the back frame 60 experiences the greatest change in load, it is contemplated that the rearmost flexible support 32 resists flexure the strongest (or, said another way, stores the most energy on recline) while the forwardmost flexible support 32 need not necessarily be as strongly resistant to flexure in the fore-to-aft direction.<br>
The illustrated seat 34 (Fig. 8) includes a seat carrier or frame 53 with side sections having front and rear cylindrical recesses 54 for receiving the bearings 52 of the front and middle flexible supports 32. The illustrated frame 53 is U-shaped, and includes side sections 53' defining a perimeter of the seat area. A seat subassembly 55 is attached atop the frame 53, and includes a generally planar, cushioned semi-resilient support 56 extended between the sides of its subframe. It is contemplated that this support can be replaced with a fabric or replaced with a more contoured cushion (whether thick or thin). Thicker or thinner cushions can also be placed on the frame 53. It is also contemplated that other traditional and non-traditional seats can be used on the present invention.<br><br>
center section 77 of the flexible support 32 to resiliently bend and flex when the arms 51 - flex. As can be seen, this causes an effective length of the arms 51 to be "longer", due to flexure of the center area 77 of the flexible support 32. It is noted that the arms 51 themselves may be strong enough to stay straight (see Fig. 11) or may themselves resiliently bend (see Fig, 10). Where resilient leaf-spring-like supports 32 are used, the vertical dimension is large enough relative to its width dimension (i.e. its thickness), so that the vertical beam stiffness is at least about 50 times its lateral bending stiffness. The reason for this 50:1 ratio is so that the supports 32 can cany considerable weight, while allowing fore-aft movement with less force. As this ratio declines, there is less control of the seat and back movement, and a stiffer fore-aft movement, which results in a less controlled feel to a seated user.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates a motion control mechanism utilizing modified flexible supports 32'. The arm sections 51 are relatively stiff and not resilient, but the arms 51 are pivotally mounted to sides of the central support box 78 at pivot locations 80 such that they are flexible. Further, torsion springs 81 could be attached at pivot locations 80 to bias the arms 51 toward their upright positions. (The solid lines illustrate the upright positions, and the dashed lines represent the fully reclined positions.)<br>
Fig. 13 illustrates an adjustable back stiffness mechanism 85 attached to the motion control of Fig. 11 instead of to the pivots 66. In the back stiffness mechanism 85, a rotatable gear 86 is attached within the box 78 and is connected to a lever or handle in a convenient location for manipulation by a seated user. A pair of slides 88 and 89 are positioned in the box 78, with their outer end sections 90 extending outward in sliding engagement with the arms 51. The slides 88 and 89 include inner end sections with racks that operably engage the gear 86. As the gear 86 is rotated, the outer end sections 90 are driven outward in direction X. This results in a shorter effective length of the arms 51. This, in turn, dramatically increases the stiffness during recline, since the shortened length of arms 51 must be bent to a much greater extent to reach a fully reclined position. This increased stiffness would support a heavier user during recline.<br>
In the description of chairs and motion control components below, components that are similar to or identical to the components of chair 30 are described using the same identification numbers, but with the addition of the letters "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E", respectively. This is done to reduce redundant discussion.<br><br>
down. As a result, the back 60D rotates about axis Dl while the seat 34D rotates forward about axis D2 upon recline.<br>
It is contemplated that a chair can also be constructed to include only a single flexible support at a rear of the seat. In such case, the front of the seat Is supported by a sliding bearing arrangement, such as a linear bearing on the seat that slides on a track on the base plate. It is noted that the track can be made linear, curvilinear, or arcuate, as desired. Also, biasing springs can be operably attached to the bearing and/or the seat to assist in biasing the seat (and back) to an upright position.<br>
Notably, the flexible supports 32 can be "reversed", with their ends being supported by a stationary member, and their central support 44 being movable upon recline. Chair 30B (Fig. 15) illustrates one such arrangement. It is contemplated that this chair 30B would potentially be useful in a stadium or auditorium or mass transit seating arrangement. Chair 30B includes a pair of spaced-apart stationary side panels 150 secured stably together, such as by connecting rods 151. The flexible supports 32B are positioned with the outer ends of their arms 51B slidably/telescopingly engaging apertures 152 in the panels 150. A central support 44B is attached to a center section of the flexible supports 32B. A seat 34B and back 35B are fixedly attached to the central support 44B. Notably, the back 35B can include a back frame or support panel having some flexibility and compliance for increased comfort. Also, the seat 34B can have a similar flexibility. Side edges of the seat 34B move along a path between and proximate the side panels 150. This helps keep the seat "square" and stable during recline.<br>
In another variation, a unitary control construction 160 (Figs. 16-17) is provided where the flexible supports 32C are integrally molded to both the seat frame 161 and the central support 44C. As illustrated, the flexible supports 32C have arms 51C with an S-shaped configuration when viewed from above. As the central support 44C is move, rearwardly upon recline, the arms 51C flex and resiliency bend, temporarily pressing t!u side sections 162 of the seat frame 161 outwardly slightly. Thus, both he flexing of inflexible supports 32C and also the flexing of the side sections 162 provide stored energy 1V-: assisting a seated user to move from a recline position to the upright position. Further since the illustrated assembly is a one-piece molding, manufacturing cost^ are lowered and assembly costs are virtually eliminated in regard to the illustrated components. Notably, the central support 44C includes an angled rear mounting surface 47C where a steel lea!<br><br><br>
