[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of the Invention] FOOT BRAKE STRUCTURE OF SCOOTER<br>
TYPE VEHICLE [Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to improvement in a foot brake structure of a scooter type vehicle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As a conventional foot brake structure of a scooter type vehicle, a structure which activates a rear wheel brake by operation of a foot brake pedal protruding upward from a foot rest plate has been known (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent No.3447470 [0003]<br>
An explanation is given below of Figs. 1, 3 and 4 in Patent Document 1.<br>
Below a foot rest plate Ps of a scooter type vehicle, a main pipe 3 is disposed in a way to extend longitudinally, or in the front-rear direction of the vehicle; and a cylindrical shaft guide 8 is attached in a way to penetrate the main pipe 3 in the widthwise direction of the vehicle; a brake shaft 9 is rotatably fitted into the shaft guide 8; a foot brake pedal BP is attached to one end of the brake shaft 9 and an intermediate lever 11 is attached to the other end of the brake shaft 9; and the intermediate lever 11 is connected to a rear wheel brake through a cable.<br><br>
The foot brake pedal BP protrudes upward from the foot rest plate Ps through a hole 30 in the foot rest plate Ps and a tread face f is provided on the top of the foot brake pedal BP. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0004]<br>
If the brake shaft 9 and foot rest plate Ps are at a considerable distance from each other, the distance between the brake shaft 9 and the tread face f is long and as a consequence, the foot brake pedal BP must be large and the structure for supporting the foot brake pedal BP must be large, leading to increase in weight and occupation of a large space.  If the shaft guide 8 is to be fitted into a large-diameter thick main pipe 3, considerable machining difficulty is involved, resulting in less freedom of design, a larger number of man-hours for machining, and cost rise.<br>
An object of the present invention is to reduce the size of a foot brake structure and increase the freedom of design, decrease the number of man-hours for machining and reduce cost,<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
The invention according to Claim 1 is characterized in that in a foot brake structure of a scooter type vehicle in which a pair of left and right step floors supported by a body frame are provided between a handlebar and a seat, a brake pedal for controlling a brake device for braking a<br><br>
if<br>
whfeel is rotatably attached to the body frame and a tread part of the brake pedal protrudes above the step floors, the step floors are supported by a support stay provided on the body frame, a spindle for the brake pedal is provided on the support stay, and the spindle is located above the body frame and below the step floors as viewed sideways. [0006]<br>
Functionally, since the brake pedal spindle is located between the body frame and step floor as viewed sideways, the spindle is nearer to the step floor than in the related art and the brake pedal under the step floor is shorter and the overall brake pedal length can be shorter.<br>
Also, the brake pedal can be easily converted into another type by changing the support stay. [0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the support stay has a U-shaped cross section with a downward opening and the bottom of the support stay is mounted on the body frame and the spindle is passed through the support stay transversely and fixed on both lateral sides of the support stay. [0008]<br>
Functionally, since the spindle is fixed on both lateral sides of the support stay, the spindle can be firmly supported.  Also, the mounting surfaces of the support stay on which the spindle is mounted are flat, the spindle is easily fixed. [0009]<br><br>
/<br>
The invention according to Claiin 3 is characterized in that, a joint between the brake pedal and the spindle is located on an outer lateral side of the body frame as viewed from above.<br>
Functionally, since the brake pedal is located at the end of the step floor, the step floor provides wide available space. [0010]<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 is characterized in that the support stay monolithically extends long along the longitudinal side of the step floor, a lock means for holding the brake pedal in a prescribed depression position upon depression of the brake pedal and a cable for connect ion from a controlling part for control of the lock means to the lock means are supported by brackets mounted on the support stay respectively, and the brackets are located before and after the spindle* [0011]<br>
Functionally, since the support stay supports the bracket as a lock means and the bracket of the controlling part for control of the lock means, special support members for supporting these brackets are not needed. [0012]<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 is characterized in that the cable includes an outer cable and an inner wire movably inserted into the outer cable, the bracket for supporting the cable has an end portion of the outer cable fixed on it with a fixing means and is L-shaped so as to<br><br>
cover the rear and outer lateral side of the cable end portion as the vehicle is viewed from above, and a hole through which the fixing means is visible is provided in the corner of the L shape. [0013]<br>
Functionally, when fitting the outer cable of the cable to the bracket for supporting the cable, fitting work is carried out while the condition of the fixing means is being checked through the hole in the corner of the L shape of the bracket. [Effect of the Invention] [0014]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 1, the step floors are supported by the support stay provided on the body frame, the spindle for the brake pedal is provided on the support stay, and the spindle is located above the body frame and below the step floors as viewed sideways, so that the brake pedal spindle can be nearer to the step floor than in the related art, and the brake pedal length can be shorter and the foot brake structure including the brake pedal and brake pedal support members can be smaller. [0015]<br>
Furthermore, by a minor change to the support stay only, for example, a scooter type vehicle brake structure having a brake lever and no brake pedal can be easily converted into a foot brake structure, which increases the freedom -of design and permits common use of the main part of the body frame.<br><br>
In the invention according to Claim 2,   the support stay has a U-shaped cross section with a downward opening and the bottom of the support stay is mounted on the body frame and the spindle is passed through the support stay transversely and fixed on both lateral sides of the support stay, so that the spindle is fixed on the support stay at two points and thus the spindle is firmly supported, and due to the flat mounting surfaces of the support stay, mountability is improved in mounting the spindle on the support stay by welding, etc. [0017]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 3, the joint between the brake pedal and the spindle is located on the outer lateral side of the body frame as viewed from above, so that the brake pedal can be located on the outer lateral side of the body frame and the brake pedal can be located at the end of the step floor.  Therefore, the step floor provides wider available space and the user-friendliness of the scooter type vehicle is enhanced. [0018]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 4, the support stay monolithically extends long along the longitudinal side of the step floor, the lock means for holding the brake pedal in a prescribed depression position upon depression of the brake pedal and the cable for connection from the controlling part for control of the lock means to the lock means are supported by brackets mounted on the<br><br>
support stay respectively, and the brackets are located before and after the spindle, so that the support arm for supporting the brake pedal supports the bracket for the lock means and the bracket for the cable, it is unnecessary to provide special support members for supporting the bracket for the lock means and the bracket for the cable and thus the number of components is not increased and the cost does not rise. [0019]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 5, the cable includes an outer cable and an inner wire movably inserted into the outer cable, the bracket for supporting the cable has an end portion of the outer cable fixed on it with a fixing means and is L-shaped so as to cover the rear and outer lateral side of the cable end portion as the vehicle is viewed from above, and a hole through which the fixing means is visible is provided in the corner of the L shape, so that the L-shaped bracket protects the end portion of the outer cable and the cable can be mounted on the bracket while the condition of the fixing means is visually checked through the hole, leading to improvement in mountability.

Next, how the abovementioned brake pedal 33 functions will be explained.<br>
Fig. 6 is a functional view showing how the brake pedal according to the present invention functions.<br>
When the tread part 33b of the brake pedal 33 is<br><br>
depressed with a foot on it and moved from point A (indicated by alternate long and two short dashes line) to point B (indicated by alternate long and short dash line) while the vehicle is running, the rear wheel brake device is activated to brake the rear wheel. [0052]<br>
When, in order to stop the vehicle, the tread part 33b is depressed and moved from point A to point B and then the knob 3 6d in the controlling part 36a in the vicinity of the handlebar is pulled toward the direction of arrow D, the lock plate 121 of the engaging arm 86 swings from point E (indicated by alternate long and two short dashes line) to point F (indicated by solid line) and the tip 121a of the lock plate 121 moves toward under the engaged arm 33d of the brake pedal 33. [0053]<br>
In this condition, when the force to depress the brake pedal 33 is decreased and the tread part 33b is moved to point C (indicated by solid line), the engaged arm 33d is engaged with the tip 121a of the lock plate 121. [0054]<br>
At this moment, the engaging arm 86 is pulled by the extension spring 111 (see Fig. 4) and thus a lock in the controlling part 36a restrains the knob 36d from moving back so that the engagement between the engaged arm 33d and the lock plate 121 is maintained.  This state is a brake lock state, namely parking brake ON state.<br><br>
When the projection 36e of the controlling part 36a is pushed down toward the knob 36d as indicated by arrow G, the lock in the controlling part 36a is released and it becomes possible for the engaging arm 86 to turn clockwise through the brake lock/unlock cable 36b, and the engaged arm 33d and the lock plate 121 are disengaged.  This state is a brake unlock state. [0056]<br>
Fig. 7 is a back right side view of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention where a muffler 55 with a heat shielding cover 141 is located on the right lateral side of the rear wheel 23 and the secondary air supply system 57 is connected with the front portion of the muffler 55.

[0063]<br>
Fig. 11 is a sectional view of a one-way valve according to the present invention, and the one-way valve 146 includes: an intake side case 185 with an intake port 185a; a valve assembly 186 located in the opening of the intake side case 185; and an exhaust side case 188 with an exhaust port 188a, which is attached to the intake side case 185 with plural bolts 187 in a way for the valve assembly 18 6 to be sandwiched between it and the intake side case 185.<br>
[0064]<br>
The intake side case 185 includes a flat U-shaped part 185b and mounting holes 185c, 185c for attachment to the bracket 145 (see Fig. 7).<br><br>
The valve assembly 186 includes: a base portion 191 with a path 191a; a leaf valve 192 like a thin plate to open or close the path 191a; a stopper 194 secured on the base portion 191 with a screw 193 together with the leaf valve 192 to prevent the leaf valve 192 from opening too much; and a seal member 196 provided around the base portion 191 to seal the area between the intake side case 185 and exhaust side case 188 and the base portion 191. [0066]<br>
The exhaust side case 188 includes a flat U-shaped part 188b and this flat U-shaped part 188b and the flat U-shaped part 185b of the intake side case 185 constitute a valve chest 197. [0067]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, firstly the present invention is characterized in that in a foot brake structure of a scooter type vehicle 10 in which a pair of left and right step floors 31, 31 (reference numeral 31 only on the near side is shown here) supported by a body frame 11 are provided between a handlebar 16 and a tandem seat 66 as a seat, a brake pedal 33 for controlling a rear wheel brake device 32 for braking a rear wheel 23 as a vehicle wheel is rotatably attached to the body frame 11 and a tread part 3 3b of the brake pedal 33 protrudes above the step floors 31, the step floors 31 are supported by a support stay 81 as a constituent of the body frame 11, a spindle 34 for supporting the brake pedal 33 rotatably is<br><br>
provided on the support stay 81, and the spindle 34 is located above the body frame 11, specifically a main frame 18 and below the step floors 31 as viewed sideways.<br>
[0068]<br>
Consequently, the spindle 34 of the brake pedal 33 can be closer to the step floors 31 than in the related art, which means that the brake pedal 33 can be shorter and the foot brake structure including the brake pedal 33 and support members for the brake pedal 33 can be smaller. [0069]<br>
Furthermore, by a minor change to the support stay 81 only, for example, a scooter type vehicle brake structure which has only a brake lever and no brake pedal can be easily converted into a foot brake structure, which increase the freedom of design and permits common use of the main part of the body frame 11, namely the main frame 18. [0070]<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, secondly the present invention is characterized in that the support stay 81 has a U-shaped cross section with a downward opening and the bottom of the support stay 81 is mounted on the main frame 18 of the body frame 11 and the spindle 34 is passed through the support stay 81 transversely and fixed on both lateral sides of the support stay 81. [0071]<br>
Since the spindle 34 is mounted on the support stay 81 at two points, the spindle 34 is firmly supported, and<br><br>
due to the flat mounting surfaces of the support stay 81, mountability is improved in mounting the spindle 34 on the support stay 81 by welding.<br>
[0072]<br>
Thirdly the present invention is characterized in that a joint between the brake pedal 33 and the spindle 34 is located on an outer lateral side of the body frame 11 as viewed from above.<br>
Consequently, the brake pedal 33 can be located on the outer lateral side of the main frame 18 of the body frame 11, specifically the right frame IBR, and thus the brake pedal 33 can be located at the end of the step floor 31.  Therefore, the step floor 31 provides wider available space and the user-friendliness of the scooter type vehicle 10 (see Fig. 1) is enhanced. [0073]<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, fourthly the present invention is characterized in that the support stay 81 monolithically extends long along the longitudinal side of the step floor 31, an engaging arm 86 as a lock means for holding the brake pedal 33 in a prescribed depression position upon depression of the brake pedal 33 and a brake lock/unlock cable 36b as a cable for connection from a controlling part 36a for control of the engaging arm 86 to the engaging arm 86 are supported by a rear bracket 87 and a front bracket 83 as brackets mounted on the support stay 81 respectively, and the front bracket 83 and rear bracket 87 are located before and after the spindle 34.<br><br>
Since the support arm 81 for supporting the brake pedal 33 supports the rear bracket 87 and front bracket 83 for supporting the engaging arm 8 6 and the brake lock/unlock cable 36b respectively, it is unnecessary to provide special support members to support the rear bracket 87 for the engaging arm 86 and the front bracket 83 for the brake lock/unlock cable 3 6b and the number of components is not increased and the cost does not rise.<br>
[0075]<br>
Fifthly the present invention is characterized in that the brake lock/unlock cable 36b includes an outer cable 114 and an inner wire 115 movably inserted into the outer cable 114, the front bracket 83 for supporting the brake lock/unlock cable 36b has the end portion of the outer cable 114 fixed on it with a nut 116 as a fixing means and is L-shaped so as to cover the rear and outer lateral side of the end portion of the brake lock/unlock cable 36b as the scooter type vehicle 10 (see Fig. 1) is viewed from above, and a hole 83c through which the nut 116 is visible is provided in the corner of the L shape.<br>
[0076]<br>
Consequently, an L-shaped rear drooping part 83b of the front bracket 83 protects the end portion of the outer cable 114 and the brake lock/unlock cable 36b can be mounted on the front bracket 83 while the condition of the nut 116 is visually checked through the hole 83c, leading to improvement in mountability.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5, in this embodiment, a single support stay 81 supports the spindle 34, front bracket 83 and rear bracket 87; however, the invention is not limited thereto and another approach is that the support stay is divided into a front stay and a rear stay and the front bracket 83 is mounted on one stay and the rear bracket 87 is mounted on the other stay and the spindle 34 is mounted on either of them.
