3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
4. DESCRIPTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of atosiban and its salts of higher yield and purity with ease of manufacturing due to use of a novel process route. Atosiban (l-(3-mercaptopropanoic acid)-2-(0-thyl-D-tyrosine)-4-L-threoriine-8-L-ornithrne-oxytocin) is a member of the class of synthetic peptide molecules that are the oxytocin mimetics. These molecules are indicated for the tocolytic therapy of preterm labour in pregnant women. The mechanism of action is through the inhibition of oxytocin function.<br>
Atosiban has been synthesized in the known art by solid state peptide synthesis methods. Several of the currently used synthesis schemes have limitations in that solvents and catalysts used are not eco-friendly and industrially economical. They also have problems with respect to scale-up and work-up of the current processes. These factors lead to formation of impurities that can limit the use of the final products in pharmaceutical compositions. Besides, solid phase synthesis methods are not routinely applied for atosiban synthesis as they have some limitation. Here an economical process for the preparation of atosiban is disclosed that uses non-linear convergent solution phase peptide synthesis approach.<br>
It is known to the skilled person in organic chemical synthesis that in order to obtain highly pure final products, it is a good strategy to avoid formation of by-products than develop purification methods to remove impurities from the final products. The principal object of this invention<br><br>
relates to an improved method of preparation of atosiban for use in pharmaceutical compositions with improved impurity profiles for peptide impurities formed during the preparation. Another object of this invention relates to the use of a novel method of non-linear / convergent synthesis of peptides required in preparation of atosiban in high purity separately of each other and then combining the precursor peptides into final cyclic peptide of atosiban. The disclosed scheme is previously not used in this type of synthesis with new chemistry that significantly increases the utility of the invention in industrial applications.<br>
Atosiban is prepared by various strategies as known in the prior art. In this invention, a novel process for the preparation of atosiban acetate is disclosed having several advantages over the existing processes. The method disclosed uses a convergent liquid phase synthesis of precursor peptide fragments, followed by condensation of the fragments leading to formation of cyclic atosiban in the final step. The first fragment of four amino acids in attached to the second fraginent of three amino acids leading to the formation of a seven amino acid fragment. This heptapeptide in then condensed with a third fragment of two amino acids leading to formation of nonapeptide followed by cyclisation leading to the formation of cyclic atosiban peptide. This strategy entirely employs liquid phase peptide synthesis having several advantages like easy scale-up of the preparation to kilogram scale and easy of handling the process steps.<br>
It is  disclosed in the prior patent applications  several methods  of preparation of atosiban and similar peptides. All the known methods use<br><br>
solid phase peptide synthesis to produce atosiban and related peptides. Solid phase methods have limitations in that scale-up is not practical in the industrial settings where economy of the process is of importance. On the other hand liquid phase synthesis of peptides has several advantages in industrial set-ups. However; there are no examples of use of LPS of atosiban in the prior art except the patent application 284/MUM/2004; which discloses methods for preparation of atosiban using liquid phase synthesis schemes. Though, disclosed methods have different schemes for ligation of fragments of precursor peptides than the invention of this disclosure. This invention disclosed more advantageous and economical methods over the prior art with novel scheme of preparation and ligation of precursor peptides, creation of salts of the peptide and purification of<br>
*<br>
said peptide.<br>
In Scheme 1 in the first step, the protected tetrapeptide of formula (1) is prepared by liquid phase peptide synthesis and isolated to high purity by HPLC. In the second step, peptide of formula (1) is condensed with the tripeptide of formula (2) leading to formation of the heptapetide of formula (3). The peptide of formula (2) is separately prepared by liquid phase peptide synthesis and isolated to high purity by HPLC. In the third step, peptide of formula (3) is condensed with the dipeptide of formula (4), which is prepared separately, leading to formation of the nonapeptide of the formula (5). In the fourth step, peptide of formula (5) is deprotected in TFA leading to formation of peptide of formula (6).<br><br><br>
This linear nonapetide is further cyclised to form atosiban (7) having a 1-6 disulphide bond between amino acid 1 and 6 of the molecule, which is purified to high purity by chromatography. The atosiban so obtained in further converted to the acetate salt by chromatographic ion-exchange leading to formation of atosiban acetate of high purity. Many of the protecting groups/moieties used in Scheme 1 can be replaced with other<br><br>
groups as shown in Table 1. Scheme 1 is depiction of an example of the protecting strategy used for the preparation of atosiban and it is not limited by the use of protecting groups shown in said scheme, and other protecting groups may be used.<br>
As depicted in Table 1, different protecting moieties that may be used for protecting different functional groups during the preparation of atosiban and similar compounds of higher yield and purity.<br><br>
The invention detailed above is illustrated with the following examples for the purpose showing the utility of the invention. Embodiments below do not restrict the invention in any way from broader application of the reaction chemistry for preparation of peptides similar to atosiban. The teaching of this invention can also be used in the preparation of the<br><br>
