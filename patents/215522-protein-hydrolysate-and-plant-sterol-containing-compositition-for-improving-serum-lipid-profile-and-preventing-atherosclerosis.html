				<td>PROTEIN HYDROLYSATE AND PLANT STEROL CONTAINING COMPOSITION FOR IMPROVING SERUM<br>
LIPID PROFILE AND PREVENTING ATHEROSCLEROSIS<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of nutrition and health. Especially it<br>
concerns improved compositions for oral use suitable for improving serum lipid<br>
profile including reducing serum total and/or LDL cholesterol and/or apolipoprotein<br>
B levels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of death in western world.<br>
Elevated serum total and/or LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triacyl-<br>
glycerol levels, as well as low ratio of HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol to<br>
LDL cholesterol, are some of the major risk factors for CVD. Recently also serum<br>
levels of apolipoprotein B 100 (apo B) has been shown to be a reliable CVD risk<br>
marker. In most developed countries a substantial amount of the population have<br>
serum cholesterol levels not within the recommended levels. One of the first steps<br>
in improving the serum lipid profile is changes in life style including changes in diet<br>
and exercise. It seems, however, difficult to change dietary habits and to follow<br>
dietary recommendations. Thus, there is a clear need for solutions beyond regular<br>
diet and lifestyle changes by which serum lipid profile can be improved.<br>
Food products enriched with components having cholesterol lowering effect beyond<br>
normal nutrition have been commercially available for some time. Representative<br>
examples are food products enriched with plant stanol or sterol fatty acid esten.<br>
Stanol fatty acid esters and the cholesterol lowering effects thereof are disclosed in<br>
US patent No. 5,502,045 as well as a suitable method for their preparation. Dietary<br>
intake of 2 to 3 g/day of plant stands is reported to lower serum LDL cholesterol<br>
levels in man up to 14% without affecting HDL cholesterol levels. The amount of<br>
atherogenic apolipoprotein B particles in blood is also decreased, thus reducing the<br>
risk of CVD.<br>
Some proteins have also been used to improve serum lipid profile. Proteins that<br>
have been shown to lower serum total and/or LDL cholesterol include e.g. soy<br>
protein (Anderson J.W., et al, New Engl. J. Medicine 1995 333 (5) 276-282), whey<br>
protein (Nagaoka et al., Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991 (55) 813-818) and wheat gluten<br>
(EP 0 790 060 Al). FDA has approved a health claim about the role of soy protein<br>
in reducing the risk of CVD by lowering blood cholesterol levels. In order to<br>
qualify for this health claim, a food must contain at least 6.25 grams of soy protein<br>
per serving, the amount being one-fourth of the effective level of 25 grams per day,<br>
and be included in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.<br>
EP 0 669 835 B1 describes a hypocholesterolemic dietary composition containing<br>
soy protein and sitosterols, the sitosterols and soy protein being of natural origin<br>
and having synergistic cholesterol lowering effect. The composition is used for<br>
example as tablets, capsules or syrups. Effective daily intakes of the composition<br>
are not given Also EP 1046 396 A2 describes a composition containing soy<br>
protein, preferably soy protein isolate or soy protein concentrate, and plant sterols<br>
having synergistic cholesterol lowering effect. The synergistic effect is achieved,<br>
when both the soy protein and plant sterols are administered in amounts that would<br>
be sufficient to induce cholesterol-lowering activity of each of the administered<br>
compound alone. WO 01/37681 describes a composition containing phytosterols<br>
and an isolated water-soluble protein, such as soy protein or caseinate, and<br>
optionally also an emulsifier. The composition can be utilized in food products,<br>
where the composition improves mouthfeel and stability of the sterol containing<br>
foods. No improved cholesterol lowering effect compared to the effect achieved<br>
with phytosterols alone is attributed to this composition.<br>
US 6,113,972 describes a phytosterol protein complex, where the complex increases<br>
the bioavailability of the phytosterols. No cholesterol lowering effect is attributed to<br>
the protein part of this composition, but the protein functions only as a carrier to the<br>
phytosterols. In fact, any fat binding protein can be used in this complex and<br>
especially egg proteins are preferred. A composition containing plant sterols/stanols<br>
and an emulsifier, mixed into a protein-containing product, is described in WO<br>
00/33669. The protein does not have any cholesterol lowering effect in this<br>
composition either, but it aids in the formation of the emulsion.<br>
Protein hydrolysates have been shown to have greater serum cholesterol lowering<br>
effect than the corresponding unhydrolyzed proteins (Sugano et al., J. Nutr. 1990<br>
(120) 977-985). The cholesterol lowering effect of protein hydrolysates might be<br>
attributed to certain peptides, for example such as found from bovine milk (3-<br>
lactoglobulin by Nagaoka et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 2001, 281(1),<br>
11-17), but this still remains to be proven by well-controlled clinical and/or animal<br>
studies. EP 0 790 060 Al discloses a protein hydrolysate/phospholipid complex for<br>
improving lipid metabolism, where the complex contains 10% or more bound<br>
phospholipids, especially lecithin or enzyme modified lecithin. Lipid profile<br>
improving effect, especially LDL-cholesterol lowering and HDL-cholesterol raising<br>
effect of lecithin is well known in prior art (for example Childs et al., 1981,<br>
Atherosclerosis 38, 217). In the complex according to EP0 790 060 A1 certain<br>
bound phospholipids (lecithin or enzyme modified lecithin) are believed to<br>
remarkably contribute to the lipid metabolism improving effect of the complex.<br>
The current literature and especially FDA"s interim approval of a health claim for<br>
plant sterols have increased the interest of the food industry in supplementing foods<br>
with plant sterols. Indeed, many such food items have recently been introduced into<br>
the market. It is assumed that new plant sterol containing foods will appear into the<br>
market rapidly.<br>
The active launching of new plant sterol containing foods has raised a concern that<br>
a part of the population may have higher daily intake of plant sterols than what is<br>
needed to obtain an optimal cholesterol lowering effect. Short-term high intake of<br>
plant sterols has not been shown to be However, there is no data on<br>
possible long-term side effects of ingestion of high daily amounts (&gt; 3g/day or<br>
higher) of plant sterols. Furthermore, there is currently not a clear understanding of<br>
the biological impact of the increased serum level and thus higher systemic<br>
availability of plant sterols caused by increased intake from sterol enriched foods,<br>
especially foods enriched with unsaturated plant sterols.<br>
There is a clear need for improved solutions by which the serum lipid profile can be<br>
improved, e.g. elevated serum total and/or LDL cholesterol levels reduced and/or<br>
HDL cholesterol levels increased and/or triacylglycerol levels reduced and/or<br>
apolipoprotein B levels reduced. Compositions based on combinations of active<br>
ingredients having enhanced, additive or even synergistic effects compared to the<br>
active ingredients alone are needed. It would also be desirable to obtain meaningful<br>
and sustainable improvements in the serum lipid profile with lower daily intake of<br>
the individual active ingredients than what is obtainable with the intakes currently<br>
used. Possible adverse effects of the active ingredients such as possible impact on<br>
fat-soluble antioxidants and other digestive discomforts could thus be reduced.<br>
Incorporation of the active ingredients into a wider range of food products without<br>
adverse effects on organoleptic properties is also needed. The present invention<br>
provides compositions meeting these requirements.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides improved compositions for improving serum lipid<br>
profile in humans and/or animals and a method for improving serum lipid profile in<br>
humans and/or animals by orally administering the composition. In one aspect the<br>
compositions comprise combinations of protein hydrolysates and plant sterols. The<br>
compositions may optionally comprise also emulsifier(s) and/or fat and/or mineral<br>
salt. The compositions comprise one or more protein hydrolysates in combination<br>
with one or more plant sterols (sterols and/or stanols) in their free and/or esterified<br>
forms, optionally in combination with one or more emulsifiers and/or fat and/or<br>
mineral salt. Preferably the emulsifier is used to produce a complex with protein<br>
hydrolysates and/or sterols. In a second aspect the compositions comprise<br>
combinations of protein hydrolysates and synthetic emulsifier(s). The compositions<br>
may optionally comprise also fat and/or mineral salt. In a third aspect of the<br>
invention the compositions comprise combinations of protein hydrolysates and lipid<br>
based grain fractions having emulsifying properties. The compositions may<br>
optionally comprise also fat and/or mineral salt.<br>
The compositions can be used as such or as Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or<br>
most advantageously in food products. Typically such an improved composition is a<br>
complex containing soy protein hydrolysate, emulsifier and plant sterols,<br>
advantageously used in food products for improving the serum lipid profile.<br>
It was found that the combination of protein hydrolysates and plant sterols,<br>
optionally with emulsifiers and/or fat and/or mineral salt, further enhance the serum<br>
lipid profile improving effect that is obtained by using the individual active<br>
ingredients and even work synergistically in improving the overall serum total lipid<br>
profile, for instance in reducing blood serum total and/or LDL cholesterol levels,<br>
and have greater effect than the additive effect that was expected. In addition some<br>
of the combinations, especially those containing soy protein hydrolysate showed<br>
beneficial effect on HDL cholesterol levels. Also the lowering of serum triglyceride<br>
levels was shown to be surprising effective.<br>
The present invention provides also means for further improving of serum lipid<br>
profile by using combinations of the active ingredients compared to the effects<br>
obtained when one of the ingredients is used alone. For example using the<br>
compositions of the present invention in combination with a healthy recommended<br>
diet provides means by which serum LDL cholesterol level can be reduced even by<br>
25% or more. The present invention thus provides a versatile non-drug approach to<br>
improve serum lipid profile, e.g. to lower serum total and/or LDL cholesterol,<br>
especially in subjects having serum lipid levels not within the recommended limits.<br>
The present invention also provides combinations of the active ingredients,<br>
especially those containing mineral salt and/or specific protein hydrolysates, that<br>
have beneficial effect on blood pressure. The combination of the active ingredients<br>
according to the present invention thus reduces the risk of CVD beyond what is<br>
obtainable by using only one of the active ingredients.<br>
The present invention further provides means for minimizing the daily intake of<br>
plant sterols in humans and still achieving a similar serum lipid profile improving<br>
effect as obtained with recommended daily intake of plant sterols from commercial<br>
plant sterol enriched products. This is especially important as the daily amount of<br>
plant sterols needed for obtaining a reduction in serum total and/or LDL cholesterol<br>
can be reduced, thus preventing potential over-consumption of plant sterols.<br>
Furthermore, the commercial availability of plant sterols is limited. In addition the<br>
commercial crude plant sterols are expensive due to their limited availability,<br>
whereas the availability of raw materials for protein hydrolysates or protein<br>
hydrolysate complexes usable according to this invention is not restricted.<br>
By the use of the compositions according to the present invention the plant sterol<br>
supply can be more effectively utilized with the aim of reducing the risk of CVD in<br>
subjects as well as in the whole population. The present invention provides a way of<br>
obtaining an enhanced serum lipid profile improvement or a similar lipid profile<br>
improvement as obtained with plant sterols or protein hydrolysate based ingredients<br>
alone, but especially with lower daily intake of plant sterols and/or protein hydro-<br>
lysate. As active ingredients based on protein hydrolysates are cheaper than plant<br>
sterols the present invention also provides a way of obtaining an optimal lipid<br>
profile improving effect more cost effectively.<br>
Compared to combinations of plant sterols and unhydrolyzed proteins previously<br>
known in the art, the compositions of the present invention comprising the<br>
combination of plant sterols and protein hydrolysates, optionally with emulsifiers<br>
and/or fat and/or mineral salt, have enhanced serum lipid profile improving effect<br>
and can also be utilized in a wider range of food products and by a wider range of<br>
consumers. In addition to having greater cholesterol lowering effect compared to<br>
unhydrolyzed proteins, protein hydrolysates are also less allergenic than<br>
unhydrolyzed proteins, thus enabling wider range of consumers being able to<br>
benefit the serum lipid profile improving effect. The compositions of the present<br>
invention can also be more easily incorporated into food products, such as<br>
beverages, without adverse effects on the texture due to the reduced viscosity of<br>
some of the protein hydrolysates compared to unhydrolyzed proteins.<br>
A problem encountered with protein hydrolysates and their incorporation into food<br>
products is often a pronounced bitter taste of the hydrolysate. The bitter taste is the<br>
result of cleavage of the proteins at amino acids with hydrophobic side chains,<br>
which results in formation of peptides with exposed hydrophobic amino acid<br>
residues. Hydrolysates may thus have an adverse effect on the taste of the food<br>
product where they are incorporated. In addition to protein hydrolysates, also some<br>
protein hydrolysate/phospholipid complexes have bitter taste and can adversely<br>
affect the taste of the products containing them. In addition to off-flavors, some<br>
protein hydrolysate/phospholipid complexes, especially complexes containing soy<br>
protein hydrolysate and lecithin or modified lecithin, have also strong yellowish or<br>
brown colour and their use in light coloured products, such as some dairy products,<br>
may thus cause off-colours to the product.<br>
The present invention by combining plant sterols and protein hydrolysates,<br>
optionally with emulsifiers and/or fat and/or mineral salt, in lipid profile improving<br>
products, such as foods, provides a way of obtaining at least similar lipid profile<br>
improving effect, especially cholesterol lowering effect, as can be obtained with<br>
protein hydrolysates alone, but with lower protein hydrolysate content and thus with<br>
less adverse effect on the taste of the food products. Complexing protein<br>
hydrolysates either with synthetic emulsifiers or with plant sterols or<br>
advantageously with both emulsifiers and plant sterols also diminishes the<br>
unpleasant taste of protein hydrolysates. The compositions according to the present<br>
invention thus widen the range of food products in which the protein hydrolysates<br>
can be incorporated to include also mild-tasting ones and still achieving at least<br>
similar serum lipid profile improving effect. The compositions of the present<br>
invention also widen the range of food products in which protein<br>
hydrolysate/emulsifier complexes can be incorporated to include also light coloured<br>
products. The present invention thus also provides a method to improve the sensory<br>
properties of lipid profile improving foods containing protein hydrolysates or<br>
protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complexes.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising a<br>
protein hydrolysate and a plant sterol, wherein the weight ratio of the plant sterol to<br>
the protein hydrolysate is from 1:0.02 to 1:150.<br>
The composition of the present invention can additionally comprise an emulsifier<br>
and/or a fat. Furthermore, the composition can comprise a mineral salt.<br>
The weight ratio of the plant sterol to protein hydrolysate in the compositions is<br>
preferably from 1:0.2 to 1:30, more preferably from 1:0.4 to 1:12.5 and most<br>
preferably from 1:1 to 1:5.<br>
As used here, the term "protein hydrolysate" includes all hydrolyzed products of<br>
proteins prepared by using a proteolytic enzyme preparation, a microorganism<br>
containing suitable proteolytic activity or acid hydrolysis or any combination<br>
thereof, and having serum lipid profile improving effect. Commercially available<br>
hydrolysates can be used or hydrolysates can be prepared. Preferred hydrolysates<br>
have a molecular weight of 300 - 100 000 D, more preferably 500 - 50 000 D, most<br>
preferably 500 - 30 000 D and/or they are only slightly soluble in water.<br>
Plant, animal or microbial proteins and/or their mixtures can be used as protein<br>
sources for the hydrolysates. Proteins of vegetable origin are preferred. Most<br>
preferred are proteins of grain or legume origin. Suitable vegetable protein sources<br>
are for example soybean protein, wheat protein, especially wheat gluten, corn<br>
protein, oat protein, rye protein, rapeseed or canola protein, barley protein, rice<br>
protein, flaxseed protein, potato protein, pea protein, lupin protein, maize protein<br>
and buckwheat protein. Of animal origin, suitable examples include milk proteins,<br>
such as whey protein, and their fractions. All these proteins can be used in different<br>
commercially available purified or non-purified forms as source for the<br>
hydrolysates. Also materials containing these proteins and other major constituents,<br>
such as carbohydrates, can be used as source for the hydrolysates.<br>
Protein hydrolysates are preferably prepared via enzymatic hydroiysis by methods<br>
and processes well known in the art, but can also be prepared using other known<br>
hydrolytic techniques, such as acid hydrolysis. For example EP 0 790 060 A1<br>
discloses a method for preparing suitable protein hydrolysates. Typical preparation<br>
methods include treatment of the protein moiety with a proteolytic enzyme in<br>
aqueous medium, where the protein or protein containing material is dispersed in<br>
water and pH is adjusted with an acid or a base to the optimum pH range of the<br>
enzyme to be used. The enzyme is preferably added in an amount of 0.2-5%, more<br>
preferably 0.5 - 2% based on the substrate protein and the reaction is carrier out at<br>
optimum temperature and pH for the time needed depending on the enzyme and the<br>
degree of hydrolysis wanted. The reaction is typically terminated by heating the<br>
mixture to a temperature high enough to inactivate the enzyme. The reaction<br>
mixture can optionally be neutralized before or after the heating step by using a<br>
suitable acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, or a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide. Preferably<br>
the fraction having serum lipid profile improving effect is then separated from the<br>
reaction mixture. In case the water insoluble or slightly water soluble fraction of the<br>
reaction mixture is desired, it can be separated e.g. by centrifugation or filtration<br>
techniques to obtain what is here referred to as a protein hydrolysate slurry. The<br>
protein hydrolysate slurry can be used as such or as washed with water and/or dried.<br>
The process used for drying is not critical, for example freeze-drying, spray drying<br>
or any other process known in the art may be used, which produces a powder either<br>
directly or through a grinding step. Dried and powdery protein hydrolysate is<br>
especially preferred as it entraps lipids efficiently. Proteolytic enzymes that can be<br>
used in the preparation of the hydrolysates of the present invention include enzymes<br>
from plant, microbial and animal origin, including also enzymes from genetically<br>
modified organisms, that at suitable reaction conditions hydrolyse proteins to<br>
hydrolysates that have a serum lipid profile improving effect. Suitable proteolytic<br>
enzymes are e.g. pepsin, trypsin, pancreatin and papain. It is also possible to use<br>
different enzymes sequentially, e.g. pepsin and trypsin or pepsin and pancreatin.<br>
Especially preferred are the enzymes or combinations of enzymes that produce<br>
protein hydrolysates that are only poorly digestible or no longer digestible in human<br>
intestine and can thus be referred also as "resistant proteins".<br>
As used here, the term "plant sterol" refers to any sterol as defined in the following<br>
and having lipid profile improving effect. Plant sterols include both sterols and<br>
saturated sterols i.e. stands in either their free form or as esterified e.g. with fatty<br>
acids (2-24 carbon atoms, saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, including<br>
also special fatty acids such as conjugated fatty acids, e.g. CLA, and EPA and<br>
DHA), hydroxybenzoic acids or hydroxycinnamic acids (ferrulic or coumaric acids)<br>
or other organic acids such as e.g. di- or tricarboxylic acids and/or hydroxy acids or<br>
with any combination of the said acids. In addition, the definition of plant sterols<br>
also include glycosidic sterols and their derivatives. Any combinations of the free<br>
and various esterified and glycosylated forms are also included.<br>
As used here, the term "plant sterol in esterified form" or "plant sterol ester" refers<br>
to plant sterols having at least 60%, preferably at least 85%, most preferably at least<br>
95% of the plant sterols in esterified form.<br>
In this specification the sterols include 4-desmethyl sterols, 4-monomethyl sterols<br>
and 4,4-dimethyl sterols (including triterpene alcohols) and the stanols include 4-<br>
desmethyl stanols, 4-monomethyl stanols and 4,4-dimethyl stanols. Typical 4-<br>
desmethyl sterols are sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, brassicasterol, 22-<br>
dehydrobrassicasterol, A5-avenasterol. Typical 4,4-dimethyl sterols are<br>
cycloartenol, 24-methylenecycloartenol and cyclobranol. Typical stands are<br>
sitostanol, campestanol and their 24-epimers, cycloartanol and saturated forms<br>
obtained by saturation of e.g. triterpene alcohols (cycloartenol, 24-<br>
methylenecycloartenol and cyclobranol). The definition "plant sterol" includes all<br>
possible natural blends or any mixtures of named sterols and/or stanols as well as<br>
any individual sterol or stanol.<br>
The amounts of plant sterols in this specification are calculated as plant sterol<br>
equivalents i.e. as the amount of free plant sterol.<br>
Commercially available plant sterols in their free or esterified form can be used as<br>
such. When plant sterols in their free form are used, the particle size of the plant<br>
sterols is preferably reduced to enhance the dispersability, dissolvability and<br>
solubility of the plant sterols. Particle size reduction can be done by many<br>
techniques known in the art, e.g. by different dry or wet grinding or micromilling<br>
techniques described for example in US 6 129 944, WO 98/58554 and EP 1 142 494<br>
A1. Other components, such as a suitable admixture can be pulverized together with<br>
plant sterols, the choice of the other components depending on the food material,<br>
nutraceutical or pharmaceutical in which the active ingredients are to be added.<br>
Examples of the admixture include various structure and flavor enhancers, as well<br>
as flours especially in case the active ingredients are to be added into bakery<br>
products.<br>
Plant sterols in their free form may also be used molten, especially in compositions<br>
containing an emulsifier and/or a fat. Preferably a homogenous mixture that is<br>
easily used in the compositions of the present invention is formed from plant sterols<br>
and an emulsifier and/or a fat by heating plant sterols to their melting point, to 60 -<br>
150 °C, typically to 130 - 150°C, and adding the emulsifier and/or fat to the sterols,<br>
either prior to or after heating. Suitable techniques that can be utilized are described<br>
e.g. in US 6,190,720 B1. Most preferably a blend of plant sterols and emulsifier(s)<br>
and/or fat is heated until the components are dissolved. The mixture is cooled under<br>
agitation prior to adding it into the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Preferably the plant sterol is esterified and most preferably it is a plant sterol fatty<br>
acid ester. The fatty acid ester is technically very suitable for incorporation into a<br>
wide range of different products and is especially preferred as it has very good<br>
organoleptic properties, enabling production of the compositions of the present<br>
invention with good organoleptic properties.<br>
Preferably the plant sterol is a stanol because its absorption is negligible and the use<br>
of stanol is therefore safer. Also the cholesterol lowering effect seems to be stronger<br>
with stanols. Most preferred are therefore the stanol fatty acid esters for use in the<br>
compositions according to the invention.<br>
As used here, the term "emulsifier" refers to a substance promoting the formation<br>
and improving the stability of emulsions. Emulsifiers are synthetically produced,<br>
derived through chemical modification of naturally occurring materials or natural<br>
products. The characterizing feature of emulsifiers is a structure in which one<br>
portion of the molecule is polar (hydrophilic) and the other non-polar (hydro-<br>
phobic), which allows the emulsifier to align and stabilize the contact surfaces of<br>
the two immiscible phases of the emulsion. The relative size and character of the<br>
polar and non-polar portions of the molecule, among other factors, affect the type<br>
and quality of emulsions produced. HLB (hydrophilic lipophilic balance) scale is<br>
commonly used to generally describe the emulsifying properties of emulsifiers. An<br>
emulsifier with a low HLB value (up to about 6) tends to promote W/O emulsions,<br>
an emulsifier with an intermediate HLB value W/O or O/W emulsions and an<br>
emulsifier with a high HLB value (from about 8) O/W emulsions.<br>
Preferably the emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers is used to produce a complex<br>
with plant sterols and/or protein hydrolysates. Typical, but non-restricting examples<br>
of suitable emulsifiers include monoglycerides, such as distilled monoglycerides,<br>
diglycerides, monoglyceride derivatives, such as acetic, lactic, succinic or citric acid<br>
esters of monoglycerides, lecithins, modified lecithins such as enzyme modified<br>
lecithin, for example lysolecithin, polyglycerol esters, polyglycerol polyricinoleate,<br>
sorbitan esters, polysorbates, propylene glycol esters, stearoyl lactylates, such as<br>
sodium stearoyl lactylate and calcium stearoyl lactylate, diacetyl tartaric acid esters,<br>
diacetyl lactic acid esters, sugar esters, and mixtures thereof. Also lipid based grain<br>
fractions having emulsifying properties can be used as emulsifiers. These include<br>
lipid fractions e.g. from oat.<br>
Preferred emulsifiers or mixtures of emulsifiers are those having a HLB value or<br>
emulsifying properties equivalent to a HLB value above 4, more preferably above 6.<br>
Examples of preferred emulsifiers include acetic, succinic, lactic and citric acid<br>
esters of monoglycerides, lecithins, modified lecithins, polyglycerol esters,<br>
polysorbates, diacetyl tartaric acid esters, monoglycerides, stearoyl lactylates and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
As used here, by "synthetic emulsifier" is meant emulsifiers that are synthetically<br>
produced or derived through chemical modification of naturally occurring materials.<br>
These synthetic emulsifiers do not have strong color, unlike some naturally<br>
occurring emulsifiers, such as lecithin and enzymatically modified lecithin. The<br>
synthetic emulsifiers can thus be used as a part of protein hydrolysate/emulsifier<br>
complexes added also into light colored products. The synthetic emulsifier are also<br>
often more pure than the naturally occuring emulsifiers. Suitable, but non-limiting<br>
examples of the synthetic emulsifiers are monoglyceride derivatives, polyglycerol<br>
esters, propylene glycol esters, polysorbates, sorbitan esters, stearoyl lactulates,<br>
diacetyl tartaric acid esters, sugar esters and mixtures thereof. Preferred synthetic<br>
emulsifiers or mixtures of synthetic emulsifiers are those having a HLB value or<br>
emulsifying properties equivalent to a HLB value above 4, more preferably above 6.<br>
As used here, the term "complex" is a composition in which only a part of the<br>
emulsifier(s) and/or fat and/or plant sterols are extractable by using non-polar<br>
solvents commonly used to extract "free lipids". These non-polar solvents include<br>
e.g. petroleum ether and hexane. The rest of the emulsifier(s) and/or fats and/or<br>
plant sterols can only be extracted after hydrolysis e.g. by using methods including<br>
acid hydrolysis, such as AOAC 922.06.<br>
As used here, by "fat" is meant edible solid fats, semi-solid fats, liquid oils and any<br>
mixtures thereof. Also fat substitutes such as sugar polyesters are included.<br>
Examples of solid and semi-solid fats that are usable include tallow, lard, butter,<br>
margarine and shortenings as well as semi-solid tropical oils, such as coconut oil<br>
and palm kernel oil. Typical examples of liquid oils include canola/rapeseed oil,<br>
soybean oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, palm oil, corn oil, sesameseed oil, cottonseed<br>
oil, wheat germ oil, peanut oil and fish oils. Liquid vegetable oils are especially<br>
preferred. The fat can be naturally occurring or modified, for example hydro-<br>
genated, transesterified, contain structured triacylglycerols or an increased amount<br>
of diacylglycerols.<br>
As used here, the term "mineral salt" includes nutritionally beneficial mineral salts<br>
having elevated K and/or Mg and/or Ca content and/or reduced Na content<br>
compared to common salt. In US patent 6 136 349 this kind of mineral salt,<br>
especially when administered together with plant sterols and/or used to replace<br>
common salt in food items, is suggested to bring beneficial health effects, such as<br>
lowering elevated blood pressure. Examples of suitable mineral salt compositions<br>
include mineral salt sold by trade name Pansalt® or Cardia® salt. The mineral salt is<br>
preferably added into the protein hydrolysate, more preferably into the protein<br>
hydrolysate slurry or washed protein hydrolysate.<br>
In the following some typical compositions of the present invention and the<br>
preparation thereof will be explained in more detail.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprising one or more protein<br>
hydrolysates and one or more plant sterols can be used as such or as a<br>
pharmaceutical or a nutraceutical or most advantageously in food products for<br>
improving serum lipid profile in man. The protein hydrolysate(s) and plant sterol(s)<br>
may be added in any suitable way into food products, pharmaceuticals or nutra-<br>
ceuticals separately as ingredients or they may be suitably combined to form<br>
compositions or complexes before forming the composition according to the<br>
invention. Preparation of the compositions and the incorporation into food products,<br>
Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals can be facilitated by reducing particle size of said<br>
compositions or components thereof e.g. by grinding or micromilling. Also other<br>
components such as water or mineral salt may be added. Typical but non-restricting<br>
examples of the preparation of the compositions and complexes are described in the<br>
following embodiments.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the protein hydrolysate(s) and the plant<br>
sterol(s) are added into food products, pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals separately<br>
as ingredients. The active ingredients are added into food material, pharmaceuticals<br>
or nutraceuticals by conventional processes for producing these products.<br>
Commercially available plant sterols in their free form can be used as such, or more<br>
preferably the particle size of the plant sterols is reduced to enhance the<br>
dispersability and solubility of plant sterols as described above. Molten plant sterols<br>
in their free form can also be used. Advantageously the main part of plant sterols is<br>
in esterified form and preferably melted, if needed, before addition into food<br>
products, pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals. Protein hydrolysates can be used in any<br>
suitable form including protein hydrolysate slurry, washed and/or dried protein<br>
hydrolysate, protein hydrolysate in an aqueous solution or protein hydrolysate with<br>
reduced particle size.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the protein hydrolysate(s) and the<br>
plant sterol(s) are combined into a composition that can be used as such or added<br>
into Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or food products. When plant sterols in their<br>
free form are used, they are mixed with dried protein hydrolysates to form a<br>
homogenous composition or more preferably homogenized with the protein<br>
hydrolysate slurry or water washed protein hydrolysate to form a protein hydro-<br>
lysate/plant sterol complex. The mixture may be used as such or preferably be dried<br>
by methods commonly used in the art, e.g. by freeze drying or spray drying, to form<br>
powder either directly or through a grinding step. Commercially available plant<br>
sterols can be used as such or preferably with reduced particle size. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the main part of the plant sterols is in esterified form. Esterified plant<br>
sterols are preferably mixed with a dried and powdery protein hydrolysate to form a<br>
protein hydrolysate/plant sterol complex.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the protein hydrolysate(s),<br>
mineral salt and the plant sterol(s) are combined into a composition that can be used<br>
as such or added into Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or food products. The<br>
mineral salt is preferably added into the protein hydrolysate, more preferably into<br>
the protein hydrolysate slurry or washed protein hydrolysate and the mixture is<br>
combined with plant sterols.<br>
Alternatively the compositions comprising the protein hydrolysate(s) and the plant<br>
sterol(s) can be prepared by exposing a mixture of unhydrolyzed protein(s) and<br>
plant sterol(s) to hydrolysis, preferably to enzymatic hydrolysis by methods and<br>
processes known in the art.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprising one or more protein hydro-<br>
lysates, one or more emulsifiers and/or fats and one or more plant sterols can be<br>
used as such or as Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or most advantageously in food<br>
products for improving serum lipid profile in man. The protein hydrolysate(s), plant<br>
sterol(s) and emulsifier(s) and/or fat(s) may be added in any suitable way into food<br>
products, Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals separately as ingredients or they may be<br>
suitably combined to form compositions or complexes before forming the<br>
composition according to the invention, which is incorporated in the food products,<br>
Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals. Preparation of the compositions and the<br>
incorporation into food products, Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals can be<br>
facilitated by reducing particle size of said compositions or components thereof e.g.<br>
by grinding or micromilling. Also other components such as water or mineral salt<br>
may be added. Typical but non-restricting examples of the preparation of the<br>
compositions and complexes are described in the following embodiments.<br>
Preferably the emulsifier is used to produce a complex with protein hydrolysate(s)<br>
and/or plant sterol(s).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the protein hydrolysate(s) and the<br>
emulsifier(s) are used to form a protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex, and the<br>
complex and the plant sterols are added into food products, Pharmaceuticals or<br>
nutraceuticals separately as ingredients. The active ingredients are added into food<br>
material, Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals by conventional processes for producing<br>
these products.<br>
The protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex can be prepared by mixing the<br>
emulsifier and protein hydrolysate e.g. by a high speed mixer, or more preferably by<br>
forming a protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex by mixing the ingredients in the<br>
presence of water. Preferably the emulsifier is dispersed in water, protein hydro-<br>
lysate added, followed by thorough mixing at room temperature. Optionally the<br>
complex is dried by conventional drying techniques, such as e.g. freeze-drying or<br>
spray-drying, to form a powdery product either directly or through a grinding step.<br>
The complex can also be prepared of the protein hydrolysate and a mixture of<br>
emulsifier and fat, with or without the presence of water. The protein<br>
hydrolysate/emulsifier complex contains preferably at least 5%, more preferably at<br>
least 10%, and most preferably at least 20% emulsifier on dry weight basis Also any<br>
commercially available protein hydrolysate/phospholipid complex can be used as<br>
protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex.<br>
Prior art discloses protein/phospholipid and protein hydrolysate/phospholipid<br>
complexes containing 10% or more bound phospholipid (EP 0 790 060 A1),<br>
especially lecithin or enzyme modified lecithin, where both the protein or protein<br>
hydrolysate and phospholipids have lipid metabolism improving effect. In the<br>
present invention a wider range of emulsifiers or their combinations can be used.<br>
This is of particular benefit when the complex is added into food products,<br>
Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals, where the emulsifiers can be selected to bring<br>
advantageous effects on the properties, e.g. texture or taste, of the final product and<br>
not just solely on the basis of enhancing the lipid profile improving effect of the<br>
protein hydrolysate.<br>
Commercially available plant sterols in their free form can be used as such, or more<br>
preferably the particle size of the plant sterols is reduced to enhance the<br>
dispersability and solubility of plant sterols. Particle size reduction can be done by<br>
many techniques known in the art, e.g. by grinding. Advantageously the main part<br>
of plant sterols is in esterified form and preferably melted, if needed, before<br>
addition into food products, Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention plant sterols in a form of a plant<br>
sterol/emulsifier complex, or plant sterols dissolved or suspended in a fat, and<br>
protein hydrolysate are added into food products, pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals<br>
separately as ingredients. The active ingredients are added into food material,<br>
pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals by conventional processes for producing these<br>
products. The plant sterol/emulsifier complex or the suspension or solution<br>
containing plant sterols and fat is prepared by dissolving or suspending plant sterols<br>
in their free form, preferably with reduced particle size, in a melt of an emulsifier, a<br>
fat or a mixture of emulsifier and fat at elevated temperatures, preferably at &gt; 60°C,<br>
more preferably at &gt; 80°C, mixing to form a homogenous dispersion or solution and<br>
cooling with agitation. Also molten plant sterols may be used. The weight ratio of<br>
plant sterols to emulsifier can be from 1:0.01 to 1:5, preferably from 1:0.05 to 1:2,<br>
more preferably from 1.0.1 to 1:2. The crude fat content, excluding plant sterols and<br>
emulsifiers, is preferably less than 80%, more preferably less than 60%, most<br>
preferably less than 20% of the weight of the complex or dispersion or solution.<br>
Also plant sterols mainly in their esterified form may be used instead of plant<br>
sterols in their free form. Protein hydrolysates can be used in any suitable form<br>
including protein hydrolysate slurry, washed and/or dried protein hydrolysate,<br>
protein hydrolysate in an aqueous solution, protein hydrolysate with reduced<br>
particle size and protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the plant sterol(s), the<br>
emulsifier(s) and the protein hydrolysate(s) are combined into a protein hydro-<br>
lysate/plant sterol/emulsifier complex that can be used as such or added into<br>
pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or food products.<br>
The complex is preferably prepared by first dissolving or suspending plant sterols in<br>
a melt of an emulsifier, a fat or a mixture of emulsifier and fat at elevated<br>
temperatures, preferably at &gt; 60°C, more preferably at &gt; 80°C, mixed to form a<br>
homogenous dispersion or solution and cooled with agitation. The weight ratio of<br>
plant sterols to emulsifier can be from 1:0.01 to 1:5, preferably from 1:0.05 to 1:2,<br>
more preferably from 1:0.1 to 1:2. The fat content, excluding plant sterols and<br>
emulsifiers, is preferably 0-80%, more preferably 0-60%, most preferably 0-20% of<br>
the weight of the complex or suspension or solution. Protein hydrolysate in a dry<br>
form, as a slurry or a water washed protein hydrolysate or an aqueous protein<br>
hydrolysate suspension or solution is then mixed and homogenized with the cooled<br>
plant sterol/emulsifier or plant sterol/fat or plant sterol/emulsifier/fat mixture to<br>
form a protein hydrolysate/plant sterol/emulsifier complex or if no emulsifier is<br>
present, a protein hydrolysate/plant sterol complex. The homogenized mixture can<br>
optionally be dried and/or its particle size reduced before usage. Plant sterols in<br>
their free form are preferably used. Plant sterols in their free form with reduced<br>
particle size are especially preferred. Also molten plant sterols may be used. Plant<br>
sterols mainly in their esterified form may also be used. The complex may also be<br>
prepared by combining a protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex and plant sterols.<br>
Alternatively the compositions consisting the protein hydrolysate(s), the<br>
emulsifier(s) and/or fat(s) and the plant sterol(s) can be prepared by first exposing a<br>
complex of unhydrolyzed protein/emulsifier or unhydrolyzed protein/plant sterols<br>
or unhydrolyzed protein/plant sterols/emulsifier(s) to hydrolysis, preferably to<br>
enzymatic hydrolysis by methods and processes known in the art and described<br>
earlier, and then combining the hydrolyzed complex with other components<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition<br>
comprising a protein hydrolysate and emulsifier(s) or emulsifier-fat mixture for<br>
improving serum lipid profile in man, wherein the synthetic emulsifier(s) are used.<br>
By using synthetic emulsifiers, the taste, colour and impurity problems commonly<br>
attributed to compositions containing natural emulsifiers can be avoided. Also the<br>
lipid based grain fraction(s) having emulsifying properties can be used as<br>
emulsifiers in a composition comprising a protein hydrolysate and emulsifier(s) or<br>
emulsifier-fat mixture. In this third aspect of the invention the protein hydrolysate<br>
and the emulsifier are perferably obtained from the same source. E.g. oat is<br>
fractionated and a protein rich fraction is hydrolysed and combined with a lipid rich<br>
fraction to a mixture or a complex. A benefit with this combination is that it is made<br>
of non-allergenic materials.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprising one or more protein hydro-<br>
lysates and one or more synthetic emulsifiers and optionally fat(s), and/or one or<br>
more lipid based grain fractions having emulsifying properties, can be used as such<br>
or as Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or most advantageously in food products for<br>
improving serum lipid profile in man. The protein hydrolysate(s) and synthetic<br>
emulsifier(s), and optionally fat(s), or the protein hydrolysate(s) and lipid based<br>
grain fractions having emulsifying properties may be added in any suitable way into<br>
food products, pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals separately as ingredients or they<br>
may be suitably combined to form compositions or complexes before forming the<br>
composition according to the invention, which is incorporated in the food products,<br>
Pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals. Preferably the synthetic emulsifier or lipid based<br>
grain fraction is used to produce a complex with protein hydrolysate(s) by methods<br>
described earlier.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a food product<br>
comprising at least one basic nutritional ingredient and at least one of the<br>
compositions of the present invention as defined above.<br>
The plant sterol constituent of the composition is present in a higher amount than<br>
naturally occurring in the basic nutritional ingredient(s).<br>
The food product of the present invention can be prepared by adding said<br>
composition to food material(s) by the conventional processes for producing food<br>
products. The composition can be added as such (either in liquid, semi-solid or<br>
dried form) or the constituents of the composition can be added separately as<br>
ingredients.<br>
The food product of the present invention can be in the form of various food<br>
compositions, including but not restricted to<br>
- bakery products and confectionery (fresh and dry bakery products, e.g. fresh<br>
bread, other bread products, cakes, muffins, waffles, biscuits, crackers, protein<br>
enriched bakery products etc.)<br>
- cereal products and snacks (breakfast cereals, muesli, bars, such as cereal based<br>
and muesli bars, such bars possibly containing chocolate, pasta products, flours<br>
etc.)<br>
- beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, including e.g. soft drinks, juices<br>
and juice-type mixed drinks, fortified beverages such as e.g. protein or calcium<br>
fortified beverages, probiotic drinks, sports and energy drinks, dietary<br>
supplement and meal replacement drinks, concentrates or premixes for<br>
beverages and powdered drinks where the content of compositions of the present<br>
invention is calculated for the ready-to-use form, etc.)<br>
- dairy products (milk, milk based products, e.g. cheese, cream cheese and the<br>
like, yogurt, frozen yogurt, other frozen dairy foods, drinkable yogurt, other<br>
fermented milk products, dairy beverages, ice cream, desserts, spreads etc.)<br>
- fermented cereal products<br>
- sauces, soups<br>
- meat, fish, poultry and egg products (e.g. sausages, meat balls etc.)<br>
- analogues for e.g. dairy or meat products (e.g. imitations of cheese, yogurt, ice<br>
cream, desserts, meat substitutes, milk alternatives etc.), non-dairy frozen<br>
desserts<br>
- soy based products<br>
- vegetable oil based products (e.g. margarines, spreads, dressings, mayonnaise<br>
etc.)<br>
- ready mixes (for baking e.g. breads, cakes, muffins, waffles, pizzas, pancakes;<br>
or for cooking e.g. soups, sauces, desserts, puddings) to be used in preparing or<br>
manufacturing foods.<br>
The food product of the present invention can also contain other nutritionally<br>
beneficial components, some of which may further enhance the effects of the<br>
compositions of the present invention. The food can be fortified with these<br>
components or the components can be an intrinsic part of the other food ingredients.<br>
Examples of the nutritionally beneficial components include diacylglycerol and n-3<br>
fatty acids, e.g. from fish oil, which have advantageous effects on the lipid<br>
metabolism and may thus reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. N-3 fatty acids<br>
act favourably on blood characteristics, e.g. they are hypotriglyceridemic and<br>
reduce platelet aggregation. Diacylglycerol reduces serum triacylglycerol levels and<br>
can thus have a favourable effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Both n-3<br>
fatty acids and diacylglycerols may lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD mortality<br>
also by other mechanisms.<br>
Other non-limiting examples of the beneficial nutritional components include<br>
dietary fibre and beneficial minor components, for example such as isoflavones,<br>
tocopherols, tocotrienols, carotenoids, vitamin C, folate and flavonoids. Also other<br>
vitamins and minerals may be added or included in the food products of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Especially the use of dietary fibre may further enhance the effects of the present<br>
compositions. By dietary fibre, it is meant food components derived from plant<br>
material, or analogous carbohydrates from other sources, that are resistant to<br>
digestion and absorption by human digestive enzymes. This includes various<br>
polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignins and associated substances that are<br>
resistant to digestion. Dietary fibre may further be classified into water-soluble and<br>
water insoluble fractions. Examples of the water-soluble fraction are e.g. pectin,<br>
plant gums, ß-glucans and resistant starch and of the insoluble fraction e.g. cellulose<br>
and hemicellulose. An adequate fibre intake is thought to have many beneficial<br>
effects, for example viscous soluble fibre is known to reduce risk of cardiovascular<br>
disease by lowering plasma cholesterol levels. In a further aspect of the present<br>
invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical product for improving<br>
serum lipid profile comprising a composition of the present invention as defined<br>
above. Said product can additionally contain at least one compounding agent. The<br>
compounding agent can be any pharmaceutically acceptable binder, carrier, diluent,<br>
excipient or coating agent. The product can be in any suitable form, e.g. tablets,<br>
granules, powder, capsules, syrups, dispersions or other liquid preparations for oral<br>
administration.<br>
The products and compositions of the present invention preferably contain at least<br>
two active ingredients, i.e. protein hydrolysate(s) and plant sterol(s), in sufficient<br>
amounts to provide improvement in serum lipid profile, e.g. reduction in serum total<br>
and/or LDL cholesterol levels. The invention is especially directed to synergistic<br>
combination of at least two active ingredients, i.e. protein hydrolysate(s) and plant<br>
sterol(s), the use of which leads to enhanced improvements in serum lipid profile<br>
compared to the effects obtained when one of the ingredients is used alone. Certain<br>
protein hydrolysate/plant sterol/emulsifier complexes according to the present<br>
invention are especially beneficial as the lipid profile improving effect is optimized<br>
by ensuring optimal availability of the active ingredients at the critical sites of<br>
action. In addition to reduction of serum total and LDL cholesterol levels, some<br>
compositions of the present invention also provide desired increase in serum HDL<br>
cholesterol levels. Some of the compositions also have a beneficial effect on blood<br>
pressure. The invention is also directed to combinations of active ingredient(s) and<br>
ingredient(s) ensuring the optimal availability of the active ingredient at the site of<br>
action, i.e. protein hydrolysate(s) and synthetic emulsifier(s).<br>
The present invention also makes it possible to reduce the daily intake of plant<br>
sterols in man and still achieving similar cholesterol lowering effects as obtained<br>
with the generally recommended daily intake of plant sterols (2-3 g) which can be<br>
achieved e.g. by consuming commercial products enriched with plant sterols. The<br>
optimal daily intake of the compositions of the present invention as such or when<br>
used in foods, nutraceuticals or Pharmaceuticals is such that a daily intake of plant<br>
sterols (calculated as sterol equivalents) of 0.4-5 g, preferably 0.5-2.5 g, more<br>
preferably 0.8-2 g is supplied.<br>
According to the present invention it is also possible to lower the protein hydro-<br>
lysate content of food products containing protein hydrolysates especially purposed<br>
for improving serum lipid profile, thus improving the organoleptic properties of<br>
such foods. The optimal daily intake of the compositions of the present invention as<br>
such or when used in foods, nutraceuticals or Pharmaceuticals is such that a daily<br>
intake of protein hydrolysate of 0.1-60 g, preferably 0.5-15 g, more preferably 0.8-<br>
10 g is supplied.<br>
The invention is also directed to food products containing at least 10% of the<br>
optimal daily intake of the plant sterols and protein hydrolysates per serving.<br>
Preferably the food products contain from 10% to 200% of the optimal daily intake<br>
of plant sterols and protein hydrolysates per serving.<br>
Typically the plant sterol content of the food products is between 0.05-20 g per<br>
100 g food product, preferably 0.1-15 g/100 g, more preferably 0.1-10 g/100 g, and<br>
most preferably 0.5-5 g/100 g and the protein hydrolysate content is between<br>
0.0002-20 g per 100 g food product, preferably 0.0005-15 g/100 g, more preferably<br>
0.001-10 g/100 g, and most preferably 0.1-10 g/100 g.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for<br>
improving serum lipid profile e.g. for lowering total and/or LDL cholesterol,<br>
increasing HDL cholesterol, reducing triacylglycerol, reducing apolipoprotein B<br>
and/or increasing the ratio of HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol in a subject,<br>
comprising orally administering to the subject a composition according to the<br>
present invention in an amount effective for improving serum lipid profile.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a method to reduce or prevent the<br>
development of atherosclerosis in humans by dietary means including orally<br>
administering to the subject a composition according to the present invention in an<br>
amount effective for improving serum lipid profile.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention obtained by combining the intake of<br>
the two active ingredients are:<br>
synergistic serum lipid profile improving effect of plant sterols and protein<br>
hydrolysates<br>
- enhanced serum lipid profile improving effect compared to what is achievable<br>
by using plant sterols or protein hydrolysates alone<br>
- lower daily intake of plant sterols is needed to achieve the same serum lipid<br>
profile improving effect than what is achieved by using plant sterols alone<br>
- lower daily intake of protein hydrolysates is needed to achieve the same serum<br>
lipid profile improving effect than what is achieved by using protein hydro-<br>
lysates alone<br>
- lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease by means of improving serum lipid<br>
profile.<br>
The present invention is especially directed to enhanced serum lipid profile<br>
improving effect by utilizing the synergistic combination of plant sterols and<br>
protein hydrolysates, optionally with emulsifiers and/or fat and/or mineral salt. The<br>
present invention is also directed to ensuring optimal availability of the active<br>
ingredients, especially protein hydrolysates, at the site of action. Certain<br>
compositions containing protein hydrolysates and emulsifiers or protein<br>
hydrolysates, emulsifiers and plant sterols according to the current invention are<br>
especially beneficial as the lipid profile improving effect is optimized by ensuring<br>
optimal availability of the active ingredients.<br>
The present invention is also especially directed to an optimized daily intake of<br>
plant sterol and protein hydrolysate to achieve a significant serum lipid profile<br>
improving effect in a form of a food product as part of the daily diet. The daily<br>
intake of plant sterols can be decreased by combining the beneficial effect of plant<br>
sterols and other lipid profile improving dietary components to achieve similar lipid<br>
profile improving effect as obtained with currently recommended daily intake (2-3<br>
g/d) of plant sterols. This approach advantageously reduces the daily intake of plant<br>
sterols, leading to a more balanced use of plant sterols. The synergistic effect is<br>
especially profound at daily intakes of at most 2 g plant sterol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the compositions contain plant sterols<br>
and soy protein hydrolysate, optionally with emulsifier(s). Preferably the plant<br>
sterol used is a plant sterol fatty acid ester and even more preferred it is a plant<br>
sterol fatty acid ester containing a substantial amount of stanol fatty acid ester,<br>
preferably at least 30% stanol fatty acid ester.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are most preferably<br>
incorporated into foods designed for being a part of a healthy diet.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of protein hydrolysate.<br>
1500 g isolated soy protein (SUPRO® Brand Isolated Soy Protein, Protein<br>
Technologies International) was dispersed in 15 1 of water, pH was adjusted to 2<br>
with HC1, and pepsin (P7000, Sigma Aldrich, activity 1:10,000) was added to the<br>
solution (1% of the amount of isolated soy protein). The reaction was carried out at<br>
37°C, for 24 hours and stopped by heating the reaction mixture to 85°C for one<br>
hour. The mixture was neutralized with sodium hydroxide (2 mol/1) and<br>
centrifuged. The precipitate was washed twice with water after which the protein<br>
hydrolysate was freeze-dried and ground. 300 g dried protein hydrolysate was<br>
obtained. The molecular weight of the peptides obtained in the hydrolysis was<br>
determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-page) method. The<br>
molecular weight range of the peptides in the hydrolysate was from 3000 to 30000<br>
D.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex.<br>
62 g of emulsifier (lysolecithin, Precept 8160, Central Soya) was dispersed in water<br>
(2500 ml) in room temperature and 500 g soy protein hydrolysate prepared as in<br>
example 1 was added. The solution was mixed by a high speed mixer (10 000 rpm),<br>
the mixture was freeze-dried and ground to obtain protein hydrolysate/emulsifier<br>
complex.<br>
The total lipid content of the complex was determined by an acid hydrolysis method<br>
(AOAC 922.06). The lipids that were not bound or only loosely bound to the<br>
complex were determined by direct petroleum ether extraction (free lipids). The<br>
content of bound lipids was calculated as the difference of total and "free" lipids.<br>
Total lipid content was 11.0 % of the complex, free lipid content 7.9 % of the<br>
complex and thus the "bound" lipid content was 3.1 % of the complex.<br>

Example 17<br>
Lipid profile improvement obtained by using a composition of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The lipid profile improving effect of a composition containing plant sterols (as plant<br>
stanol fatty acid ester) and protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex (as soy protein<br>
hydrolysate/lysolecithin complex from example 2) was studied by using LDL-<br>
receptor deficient female mice as test animals.<br>
The aim of the test was to study the serum total cholesterol and triglyceride<br>
lowering effect that could be obtained by using only a small amount of plant sterols<br>
(0.5 %, as sterol equivalents) as part of a atherogenic diet containing protein<br>
hydrolysate. The protein hydrolysate was administered in an amount to yield the<br>
maximum cholesterol lowering effect that could be obtained by using the<br>
hydrolysate in this animal model and still not compromising the nutritional needs<br>
and growth of the mice. The suitable amount of the hydrolysate was found to be ½<br>
(as N equivalents) of the total protein content of the diet.<br>
The animals were assigned into 4 groups (n=8-10 in each group) and fed<br>
experimental diets for 8 weeks.<br>
All the experimental diets were formulated to contain 20 % protein. In the control<br>
group and in the test group 2, the sole protein source was casein (88 % purity). In<br>
the test groups 3 and 4, the protein source was half casein and half (as N<br>
equivalents) the protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex. Test groups 2 and 4<br>
contained 0.84 % plant stanol fatty acid ester (0.5 % as sterol equivalents). Control<br>
group and test group 3 contained 0.35 % rapeseed oil to bring the equal amount of<br>
calories and equal fatty acid composition, compared to the test groups getting plant<br>
stanol ester.<br>
*Clinton/Cybulsky (D12106px, without protein), from Research Diets Inc.<br>
As shown in the table, both plant stanol ester and protein hydrolysate/emulsifier<br>
complex had serum cholesterol lowering effect (groups 2 and 3, respectively). A<br>
composition of the present invention (group 4), the combination of plant sterols and<br>
protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex, had even enhanced cholesterol lowering<br>
effect compared to the plant sterols (group 2) or protein hydrolysate/emulsifier<br>
complex (group 3) alone and compared to what was expected for the combination.<br>
Thus even when the maximal amount of protein hydrolysate was used in the feed<br>
addition of plant sterols effectively further reduced serum total cholesterol levels<br>
Protein hydrolysate/emulsifier complex (group 3) had serum triglyceride reducing<br>
effect, whereas the serum triglyceride level was somewhat raised in the group 2<br>
receiving plant sterols. Surprisingly, the combination of plant sterols and protein<br>
hydrolysate/emulsifier complex had a strong synergistic triglyceride lowering<br>
effect.<br>
By combining plant sterols and protein hydrolysate, according to the present<br>
invention, remarkable synergistic lipid profile improvements could be seen.<br>
The present invention, as described substantially hereinabove, provides a<br>
therapeutical composition, duly illustrated by Examples 1 to 8, which is capable to<br>
cause significant improvement in lipid profile, e.g. reduction in total and/or LDL<br>
Cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein B and increase in ratio of HDL cholesterol to<br>
LDL cholesterol. It also provides a food product as illustrated substantially by<br>
Examples 9 to 16 which, on daily intake in optimum amount, is beneficial towards<br>
achieving significant improvement in lipid profile.<br>
