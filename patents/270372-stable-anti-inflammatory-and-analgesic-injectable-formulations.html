3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention:<br><br>
21 JUL 2008<br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention is to provide stable anti-inflammatory and analgesic injectable formulations of Diclofenac sodium as the active ingredient and a chelating agent, buffer and antioxidant along with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and the process of preparation thereof.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Diclofenac sodium is a NSAID (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drug) used to treat the inflammation and pain of musculoskeletal complaints arthritis osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile forms of arthritis and to treat mild to moderate post-operative or post-traumatic pain, particular when inflammation is also present, and is also effective against menstrual pain.Diclofenac works by preventing the production of irritant chemicals that cause pain and inflammation in the body. Diclofenac is available in tablet, soluble tablet, suppository and injection form.<br>
Diclofenac is an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase. It is metabolised in the liver to 4-hydroxydiclofenac and other hydroxylated forms. After glucoronidallon and sulphation, the metabolites are excreted in the urine (65%) and bile (35%).<br>
2<br>
Chemically Diclofenac sodium of formula I is 2-[(2, 6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzeneacetic acid, monosodium salt. The molecular weight is 318.14 and the molecular formula is C14H10C12NNaO2.<br><br><br>
There are various commercially available preparations of Diclofenac sodium. Prior art provides various compositions of Diclofenac parenteral preparations.<br>
US5554650 discloses an antiphlogistic, analgesic, antipyretic parenteral preparation comprising diclofenac, its salt, or both, as effective components. This parenteral preparation provides sustained release of the drug, along with substantial reduction of side effects upon and after administration.<br>
US4711906 discloses a stable, liquid diclofenac preparation, for the parenteral application, consisting of a solution of diclofenac or one of its salts in an amount of 1.5-6.0 weight % diclofenac in a solvent, wherein the solvent consists of 10-70 weight % of a mixture of propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol and 30-90 weight % water, and the weight ratio of propylene glycol to polyethylene glycol is between 9.5:0.5 and 0.5:9.5.<br>
EP1609481 discloses an injectable pharmaceutical composition in the form of an aqueous solution, comprising sodium diclofenac at a concentration greater than 25 mg/ml of water and a beta-cyclodextrin, wherein said composition comprises at least a polysorbate in an amount ranging between 0.01 and 0.06% by weight with respect to the total volume of the solution.<br>
US20040068007 discloses a group of novel pharmaceutically acceptable salts, each containing local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory activities. The preferred pharmaceutical acceptable salt in this group is Diclofenac salt of lidocaine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for use in topical treatment or parenteral injection to treat patients with localized pain, including, but not limited to, muscle pain, joint pain, pain associated with herpes infection, and/or wound pain (such as surgical pain or burn pain). Methods for making the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also disclosed.<br><br>
3<br><br>
Indian Application No 96/MUM/2005 discloses injectable formulations of water-soluble salts of diclofenac in single doses of less than 2 ml, which cause significantly less pain at the site of injection and can be administered by intradeltoid route, in addition to intragluteal and slow intravenous route. More specifically the injectable preparations contain 75 mg to 100 mg of water-soluble salts of diclofenac, in about 1 ml injection solution without significantly raising the viscosity of the injection solution without the use surfactants. The formulations are adjusted to pH 6 to 10 containing up to l00mg of diclofenac salt in a medium comprising of water, along with one or more co-solvent(s) / solubiliser(s), antioxidants, preservatives, buffers, alkali and stabilizers.<br>
Diclofenac injections are formulated conventionally using propylene glycol as solvent. But the commercially available Diclofenac injections have several disadvantages like it produces pain and irritation at the site of injection. Due to these drawbacks the Diclofenac injections made using propylene glycol provides less patient compliance.<br>
Therefore, in view of the disadvantages associated with prior art compositions a need arises for safe, convenient and stable Diclofenac compositions which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide stable anti-inflammatory and analgesic injectable formulations of Diclofenac Sodium as the active ingredient and a chelating agent, buffer and antioxidant along with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and the process of preparation thereof.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide stable, aqueous pharmaceutical injectable formulation having strength of 75 mg of Diclofenac Sodium in 1 ml of water.<br>
4<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention discloses stable anti-inflammatory and analgesic injectable formulations of Diclofenac sodium as the active ingredient and a chelating agent, buffer and antioxidant along with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used for the treatment of analgesia and inflammation. The present invention further discloses the process of preparation of the said composition using chelating agent for the stabilization of the parenteral preparation.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
