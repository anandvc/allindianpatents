				<td>The present invention relates to an improved gas fired burner and a curtain type burner<br>
systems having a plurality of said burners and a method of sintering top layer of raw<br>
material fines and fuel fines in a sintering process.<br>
The improved burner according to this invention is used for igniting the moving top layer in<br>
of sinter bed in sintering process by advantageous and efficient burning with a curtain type<br>
top mounted gas fired burner system for igniting top layer of a sinter bed.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is well known to use gas-fired burners for igniting the top layer in a sinter bed. A<br>
conventional burner consists of number of side turbulent type of burners, located on two<br>
sides of ignition furnace. Burners heat up the furnace and its refractory mass. Heat transfer<br>
from furnace to sinter bed takes place mainly through radiation. Lot of heat is wasted to the<br>
atmosphere through the walls of the larger furnace.<br>
In a conventional process of igniting the top layer of a sinter bed the following procedure is<br>
followed. Flame from burner heat up the refractory mass inside the furnace primarily by<br>
radiation, which in turn transfer major part of the heat to the top layer of sinter bed through<br>
radiation. A minor part of the heat is also transferred to the top layer of sinter bed by<br>
convection when the low temperature combustion products are sucked through the bed<br>
after releasing major part of its energy through radiation.<br>
DRAW BACK OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
It has been found that the fuel consumption is very high during the normal running of the<br>
machine.<br>
Another drawback is that heat load required is considerable high to keep the furnace warm<br>
during machine switched off condition.<br>
Another drawback is that the construction and maintenance cost of furnace is exorbitant.<br><br>
Yet another drawback is the furnace's length for sinter ignition is considerable. This<br>
decreases the remaining length of the furnace strand available for sintering thereby<br>
increasing investment cost and also product cost.<br>
The conventional process and the conventional burner are therefore not energy efficient and<br>
economical.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the invention to obtain an improved gas fired burner for<br>
providing efficient burning of the fuel gas than before.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a burner, which can be custom made.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide such a burner which can be easily<br>
mounted or dismantled and also can be easily cleaned whenever required.<br>
A still further object of the invention is directed to an improved burner, a plurality of which<br>
can be aligned to form an assembly of burners in a single row on the roof of a low height<br>
small furnace.<br>
According to yet another object of the invention directed to obtain an improved burner<br>
system having a plurality of improved burners which can create a continuous curtain type<br>
flame wherein the flame directly impinges uniformly on the top layer of the charge on the<br>
sinter bed.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to obtain an improved process for igniting top layer<br>
of a sinter bed by using the improved burner system such that the top layer of the charge<br>
on the sinter bed derives heat required to ignite the top layer mainly by convection.<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic aspect of the present invention is thus directed to an improved gas fired burner<br>
module comprising of a number of vertical cylindrical gas tubes arranged in a straight line<br>
for supplying fuel gas in conjunction with a gas header and a gas inlet, a number of co-<br>
axially disposed vertical cylindrical primary air tubes around the said gas tubes arranged in<br><br>
a straight line for supplying primary air in conjunction with an air header and an air inlet.<br>
The leading end of the gas tubes being surrounded by a set of air swirlers and there being a<br>
refractory or metallic block at the tip end of the burner module which is provided with<br>
secondary air slits.<br>
The air header extends from and covers the gas tube exteriorly from the trailing end.<br>
The portion of the gas tube uncovered by the air header is provided with a cylindrical<br>
annular space having primary air swirlers.<br>
The said annular space is formed between an outer primary air tube and the leading end of<br>
the cylindrical gas tube.<br>
The above said outer primary air tube is covered by a refractory or metallic block extending<br>
to the required length forming the tip end of the burner module.<br>
The refractory or metallic block has a first internal cylindrical section followed by a divergent<br>
section forming the tip end of the burner module.<br>
The outer vertical surface parallel to the plane joining the axes of the gas/air tubes of the<br>
entire refractory or metallic block is provided with a secondary air slits.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an improved burner system<br>
having a plurality of the above said improved burner modules mounted in an assembly in a<br>
single row on the top end of a low height small furnace.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided an improved process for<br>
igniting the top layer of a sinter bed involving said burner system, which comprises<br>
impinging upon the top layer of the charge of the sinter bed with a continuous curtain type<br>
flame generated by said burner system, thereby giving the heat required to top layer mainly<br>
by convection.<br>
The said top layer is made of a moving bed of a mixture of raw material fines and solid fuel<br>
fines as required.<br>
The present invention and its objectives and advantages are described in further details with<br>
reference to the accompanied drawing:<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE:<br>
Figure 1 : shows the cross-section of an improved burner module of the invention.<br>
Referring to the drawing it can be seen that each burner consists of a vertically erected<br>
central tube for supplying fuel gas (1) a concentric outer tube with swirlers for supplying<br>
primary air (2) and an outer jacket with small apertures called slits one at each lateral side<br>
of the burner for supplying secondary air (3). A number of burners are assembled in one<br>
unit called burner module. Individual pipes supply fuel gas &amp; air to each module. The gas<br>
header (4) and air header (5) for distribution of the same to each burner have been made<br>
compact and incorporated inside the burner module. In order to anchor the flame, to<br>
provide sufficient mixing between fuel, gas &amp; primary air and to make the flame generated<br>
by individual burners overlap and form a continuous flame, a burner block<br>
(metallic/refractory) (6) is provided at the tip of the burner. If the flame length requirement<br>
of the burners changes from one Application to another, the burner design can be modified<br>
to distribute primary and secondary air inside the burner accordingly. To ease mechanical<br>
cleaning of the gas tube, an aperture (7) covered by a lightweight blank flange bas been<br>
provided at the top of the gas tube of each burner.<br>
The burner system creates a continuous curtain type flame where the flame directly<br>
impinges uniformly on the top layer of the charge thereby giving the heat required to ignite<br>
the top layer mainly by convection.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
1.	Reduction in fuel consumption by more than 35% during normal running of the<br>
machine.<br>
2.	Total elimination of the « 30% heat load required to keep the conventional furnace<br>
warm during machine stoppages.<br>
3.	Saving in furnace cost by more than 85%.<br>
4.	Availability of more strand length for sintering as the furnace length is reduced by «<br>
75%. This can be utilized in increasing the production from the machine by<br>
increasing the machine speed.<br><br>
