				<td>Description<br>
Disconnection arrangement and method for operation of a<br>
disconnection arrangement<br>
The invention relates to a disconnection arrangement having a<br>
first electrode and a second electrode, with the second<br>
electrode having a recess which at least partially holds a gas<br>
generator.<br>
By way of example, a disconnection arrangement such as this is<br>
known from Swiss Patent Specification CH 347 885, which<br>
describes a surge arrester which is equipped with a<br>
disconnection arrangement in order to interrupt current. The<br>
disconnection arrangement has a first and a second electrode,<br>
which are separated from one another with the recess in the<br>
second electrode being overhung partially by the first<br>
electrode. The recess is designed such that a gas generator is<br>
accommodated in it, with the recess being closed because of the<br>
shape of the gas generator. Surrounding the gas generator, the<br>
second electrode has a projecting shoulder, such that the<br>
projecting shoulder is used as a foot point zone for an arc.<br>
The projecting shoulder is intended to protect the gas<br>
generator there against arcs flashing over. Furthermore, the<br>
prior art describes the fact that other shields can also be<br>
provided. Despite the gas-generator shields described in the<br>
prior art, the response of the gas generator is relatively<br>
imprecise. In consequence, a number of disconnection<br>
arrangements of the same type has a comparatively broad<br>
tripping response scatter.<br><br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of specifying a<br>
disconnection arrangement which has a better tripping response.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved in the case of a<br>
disconnection arrangement of the type mentioned initially in<br>
that the recess is covered by an electrically conductive cover.<br>
The shielding of the gas generator, as known from the prior art<br>
by means of an annular field control electrode serves on the<br>
one hand to guide an arc of projecting body edges of the second<br>
electrode, while on the other hand these body edges are also<br>
used to shield the gas generator. This multiple purpose means<br>
that compromises have to be made with regard to the design of<br>
the body edges.<br>
The provision of a cover according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to guide and to steer the foot point of the arc in an<br>
enlarged area in the vicinity of the gas generator. This allows<br>
the thermal effect of the arc to act on the gas generator in a<br>
better manner, preventing direct jumping over to a housing<br>
section of the gas generator since the gas generator is located<br>
within an area in which there is no field, and the gas<br>
generator itself is not part of the shield for the area in<br>
which there is no field. It is thus possible to set the<br>
response of a disconnection apparatus in a better manner. For<br>
certain cases, there is no need for the gas generator to be<br>
tripped on operation, that is to say when an arc is struck<br>
between electrodes. This is true in particular for relatively<br>
low-powered arcs. The power level of an arc is governed by its<br>
absolute magnitude and by its time profile. The cover allows<br>
arc paths of relatively low-power arcs to be<br><br>
lengthened within the disconnection arrangement, and allows the<br>
arcs to be quenched earlier. This is additionally assisted<br>
since, because of the cover, a larger volume of electrically<br>
conductive material is available, which allows heat to be<br>
dissipated quickly. In this case, by way of example, the wall<br>
thickness of the cover can be varied in order to adjust the<br>
response threshold of the gas generator. It is also possible to<br>
use different material combinations and/or alloys for the<br>
electrically conductive cover. The provision of an electrically<br>
conductive cover is particularly advantageous for disconnection<br>
apparatuses in which the gas generator is tripped exclusively<br>
by arc effects. Disconnection arrangements such as these are<br>
also referred to as a "one-way disconnection arrangement". In<br>
contrast to this, an additional heating element is provided on<br>
"two-way disconnection arrangements" , and can be used to trip<br>
the gas generator.<br>
By way of example, explosive capsules containing explosives,<br>
for example blank cartridges, can be used as a gas generator.<br>
However, it is also possible to use other pyrotechnic elements.<br>
It is advantageously possible to provide for the cover to make<br>
electrically conductive contact with the second electrode.<br>
An electrically conductive connection to the second electrode<br>
makes it possible to transfer the electrode potential to the<br>
cover in a simple manner. For example, it is possible to use<br>
the cover as a guide for a foot point of a burning arc.<br>
Particularly in the case of a cover which separates the second<br>
electrode from an arcing area, it is possible to protect the<br>
second electrode against being burnt away. Lower-cost<br><br>
materials can thus correspondingly be used for the electrode<br>
material. An alloy material, which is correspondingly resistant<br>
to being burnt away, can be used for the volume of the cover,<br>
which is smaller than the volume of the second electrode.<br>
Furthermore, the provision of a separate cover on the electrode<br>
makes it possible to combine the electrode with covers shaped<br>
in different ways. Arc paths of different shapes can thus be<br>
produced in a simple manner.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible to provide<br>
for the cover to be formed like a shroud.<br>
In addition to the configuration of the cover, for example in a<br>
flat, disk-like form, it is advantageous to provide the cover<br>
with a recessed area. The recessed area can be used in order to<br>
hold an arc foot point in specific areas of the cover and thus<br>
to form an arc foot point zone. Furthermore, the shroud-like<br>
recessed area in a cover can be used, for example, to center<br>
and to position the gas generator. In this case, it is<br>
advantageous, for example, for the cover to have a dome-like<br>
projection. This dome-like projection may in this case have<br>
various shapes. For example, cup-like shrouds can be provided,<br>
or it is possible to provide truncated-conical or cylindrical<br>
spheres. In this case, it is advantageous to provide the<br>
shroud-like area with a peripheral web in order to allow the<br>
cover to be positioned and to be fixed. Furthermore, the<br>
shroud-like cover makes it possible to split the various volume<br>
elements in the interior of the disconnection arrangement.<br>
Volume elements can be distributed variably by means of a more<br>
or less strongly pronounced shroud shape. For example, volume<br>
elements can be<br><br>
compartmentalized which are intended to be used only as<br>
required for accommodation, for example, of erosion products of<br>
the arc or for temporary accommodation of expanded gases.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible to provide<br>
for the gas generator to be pressed in the recess such that it<br>
can move guided with respect to the cover.<br>
Mounting the gas generator such that it can move allows it to<br>
be moved while an arc is burning. By way of example, expanded<br>
gases can be used for this purpose. The compression of the arc<br>
energy to a movement of the gas generator allows a portion of<br>
the arc energy to be dissipated in the interior of the<br>
disconnection apparatus. For example, the gas generator can be<br>
guided in a cylindrical recess in which it can be moved like a<br>
piston. By pressing the gas generator against the cover, the<br>
gas generator is always arranged, when the disconnection<br>
apparatus is in the unoperated state, in the vicinity of the<br>
zones which are intended for guidance of the arc. This makes it<br>
possible to ensure rapid response times, for example in the<br>
case of high-power arcs. In this case, it is advantageous for<br>
the gas generator to be pressed against the cover for example<br>
by means of an elastically deformable element, such as a<br>
helical spring. Furthermore, the contact pressure with the gas<br>
generator makes it possible to remove this from the cover, for<br>
example in the case of low-power arcs, against the contact-<br>
pressure force on the elastically deformable element, and to<br>
move the gas generator back to its initial position against the<br>
cover again once a low-power arc has decayed. It is thus<br>
possible to control the tripping of the disconnection<br>
arrangement in a better manner.<br><br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible for the<br>
recess to be in the form of a blind hole and to have a widening<br>
cross section at its end facing the cover.<br>
As mentioned initially, blank cartridges, which are pushed into<br>
the recess, which is in the form of a blind hole, are<br>
particularly suitable for use as gas generators. In the bottom<br>
area, blank cartridges have a radial flange which is held in<br>
the widened cross section of the recess when the blank<br>
cartridge is inserted into the recess. This makes it possible<br>
to insert the gas generator into the recess such that it is<br>
flush. In this case, the widening cross section should extend<br>
in its depth in the direction of the bottom area of the recess,<br>
which is in the form of a blind hole, such that, when the<br>
cartridge is moved in the direction of the blind hole, the<br>
opposite end of the blank cartridge indirectly or directly<br>
strikes against the bottom of the blind hole before the<br>
peripheral collar on the blank cartridge is in place, thus<br>
restricting any movement of the blank cartridge, which acts as<br>
the gas generator.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the first<br>
electrode to have a first arc foot point zone, and for the<br>
cover to have a second arc foot point zone.<br>
Arc foot point zones are used to steer and guide an arc when it<br>
is burning. To this end, the arc foot point zones may, for<br>
example, have a circular structure, an annular structure, a<br>
structure with projections, shroud-like structures, etc. The<br>
provision of a respective arc foot point zone on the first<br>
electrode and on the cover makes it possible to provide an<br>
arcing area<br><br>
for the disconnection arrangement in a comparatively versatile<br>
form.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible to provide<br>
for the cover to have a gas channel.<br>
A gas channel on the cover makes it possible to divert a<br>
portion of the gas pressure for example through a recess, from<br>
the arcing area of the disconnection arrangement. It is thus<br>
possible to enlarge the volume of the arcing area of the<br>
disconnection arrangement, when necessary, via the gas channel.<br>
In addition, the available volume can be enlarged by mounting<br>
the gas generator in its recess such that it can be moved in a<br>
similar manner to a cylinder, with the gas generator being<br>
moved to a greater or lesser extent depending on the magnitude<br>
of the gas pressure. The gas generator and gas channel in this<br>
case interact like a valve. It is thus possible to damp the<br>
influence of the arc. This prevents sudden tripping of the gas<br>
generator and allows more accurate tripping of the<br>
disconnection arrangement particularly in the boundary area<br>
between high-energy arcs, which necessarily cause the immediate<br>
tripping of the gas generator, and low-energy arcs, which are<br>
in the region of a tripping threshold. The cross section of the<br>
gas channel should be smaller than the arc foot point zone<br>
which is intended to guide the arc on the cover.<br>
A further advantageous refinement allows the cover to be<br>
positioned on an insulating body which separates the two<br>
electrodes from one another.<br>
An insulating body can be used to separate and position the two<br>
electrodes, including a fixing for the<br><br>
cover. Furthermore, the insulating body can also be designed<br>
such that it at least partially bounds the arcing area of the<br>
disconnection arrangement. By way of example, hollow-<br>
cylindrical insulating bodies can be used for this purpose. In<br>
particular, the use of clamping seats and interference fit<br>
makes it possible to provide sufficient mechanical robustness<br>
for the entire arrangement. Connections formed such as these<br>
adequately seal the individual assemblies from one another.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageously possible to provide for the<br>
insulating body to have a specific impedance value. This<br>
impedance value makes it possible to control the voltage drop<br>
across the arc path, in parallel with the arc path. A flashover<br>
can therefore be deliberately initiated in the arc path.<br>
It is also possible to provide for a non-reactive resistance to<br>
be connected in parallel with the insulating body, and to make<br>
electrical contact with the first electrode and the second<br>
electrode or the cover element. It is thus possible to set the<br>
tripping response of a disconnection arrangement more<br>
specifically when using high-impedance insulating bodies.<br>
Irrespective of the physical design of the disconnection<br>
arrangement, resistance elements connected across the arc path<br>
define different types of operating characteristics of the<br>
disconnection arrangements.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageously possible for the first<br>
electrode, the second electrode and the insulating body to be<br>
embedded in an electrically insulating sheath.<br>
Encapsulation compounds, such as resins or silicones, can be<br>
provided as an electrically insulating sheath. These embed the<br>
electrodes and the insulating body, and surround these<br>
components. It is thus possible to protect the electrodes<br><br>
and the insulating body against external mechanical influences<br>
and, for example, to make the disconnection arrangement<br>
resistant to open-air use. In addition, the electrically<br>
insulating sheath can make the disconnection arrangement<br>
mechanically robust. This can be done, for example, at low cost<br>
by the use of shrink sleeves which additionally press the<br>
individual components against one another and assist the<br>
robustness and angular stiffness of the overall arrangement.<br>
A further advantageous refinement allows the two electrodes to<br>
be made rotationally symmetrical with respect to a rotation<br>
axis, and to be separated from one another at the end, without<br>
being coincident.<br>
Rotationally symmetrical electrodes can be manufactured at low<br>
cost. Furthermore, rotationally symmetrical bodies have<br>
dielectrically good contours. Projecting points and edges are<br>
avoided. Disconnection arrangements such as these are therefore<br>
also suitable for use in the medium-voltage, high-voltage and<br>
very-high-voltage range, that is to say for voltages above 1000<br>
volts, in particular above 10 kV, 30 kV, 70 kV, 145 kV and<br>
above. Separation of the two electrodes at the ends allows the<br>
arc foot point zones to be arranged opposite at the ends, in<br>
such a way that they are opposite in the form of a plate-type<br>
capacitor. The electrodes are therefore covered by insulating<br>
material in the radial direction in the region of the arcing<br>
area. By way of example, this may be the insulating body. This<br>
allows better steering and guidance of the arc and prevents<br>
premature damage to the gas generator, for example by frequent<br>
operation of the disconnection arrangement by low-power arcs.<br>
Despite the disconnection arrangement having been operated,<br>
this ensures reliable tripping of the disconnection arrangement<br>
in the future as well.<br><br>
A further advantageous refinement allows the disconnection<br>
arrangement to be included in an output current path which can<br>
be controlled by means of a surge arrester.<br>
Surge arresters are used, for example, in electrical power<br>
transmission networks in order to form an output current path<br>
to a ground potential when necessary, for example in order to<br>
dissipate overvoltages. In this case, the output current path<br>
is connected by means of voltage-dependent resistance elements,<br>
so-called varistors. The surge arrester is therefore part of<br>
the output current path which, for example, runs in the form of<br>
a conductor system from parts which are generally live to<br>
ground potential. The surge arrester therefore represents a<br>
switching element, which can be switched repeatedly, in the<br>
output current path. When the disconnection arrangement is<br>
included, the disconnection arrangement makes it possible to<br>
ensure that permanent disconnection of the output current path<br>
is possible, for example, in the event of a short circuit in<br>
the surge arrester. To this extent, a disconnection arrangement<br>
represents a safety device in order to prevent the formation of<br>
a permanent ground-fault current path in an electrical grid<br>
system in the event of a fault in the surge arrester.<br>
In this case, the disconnection can be carried out in such a<br>
way that tripping can clearly be seen from the outside. By way<br>
of example, this can be achieved by the disconnection<br>
arrangement being broken down into a plurality of parts when<br>
the gas generator trips, such that the response can easily be<br>
seen visually, because of this breakdown.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to specify a method for<br>
operation of a disconnection arrangement which has a first and<br>
a second electrode and a gas generator.<br>
Previous methods have had an undifferentiated tripping<br>
response, that is to say it is possible to distinguish only to<br>
a restricted extent between high-power arcs and low-power arcs<br>
in the arcing area of the disconnection arrangement. This<br>
results in a relatively coarse tripping pattern, which leads to<br>
so-called undifferentiated tripping.<br>
However, it is desirable that every operation of the<br>
disconnection arrangement does not lead to tripping of the<br>
disconnection arrangement. In this context, the expression<br>
operation means that an arc is struck in an arcing area of a<br>
disconnection arrangement. Operation such as this takes place,<br>
for example, when the surge arrester responds.<br>
One object of the invention is therefore to specify a method<br>
which allows more defined tripping of the disconnection<br>
arrangement.<br>
According to the invention, in the case of a method of the type<br>
mentioned above, this is archived in that:<br>
-	an arc is struck if a limit voltage is exceeded between a<br>
first arc foot point zone and a second arc foot point zone,<br>
-	in that the arc causes gas to expand,<br>
-	in that an additional accommodation volume for the gas is<br>
accessible, depending on the expanded gas.<br>
The use of the thermal effect of the arc and of the expansion<br>
of gas associated with this in order to provide an additional<br>
accommodation volume makes it possible, when necessary,<br><br>
to enlarge the volume that is available to accommodate the<br>
expanded gases within the disconnection arrangement.<br>
To this end, it is advantageously possible to move the gas<br>
generator on a guide device by means of the gas.<br>
For example, the gas generator may be mounted like a piston in<br>
a sliding form in a recess which acts as a guide device, such<br>
that the movement of the gas generator opens up the additional<br>
accommodation volume for the expanded gas.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageously possible to trip the gas<br>
generator during or after movement of the gas generator.<br>
The gas generator should advantageously be tripped during or<br>
after movement of the gas generator. It is thus possible to<br>
provide an adequate time window during the movement of the gas<br>
generator in order to make it possible to distinguish between<br>
low-power arcs, which, although they result in operation of the<br>
disconnection arrangement, should actually not cause tripping<br>
of the disconnection arrangement, and high-power arcs which<br>
would also cause tripping of the disconnection arrangement<br>
after operation of the disconnection arrangement. Low-power<br>
arcs are not able to introduce sufficient energy into the<br>
disconnection arrangement that sufficient energy is available<br>
to trip the gas generator even after an enlarged accommodation<br>
volume is made available. Low-power arcs expand after<br>
additional accommodation volume is released. It is possible to<br>
provide, for example, for the accommodation volume<br><br>
to have a variable volume, depending on the strength of the<br>
arc. Different chambers can therefore be provided which are<br>
connected in steps, or one chamber can be provided which itself<br>
allows a volume change by deformation or movement of the walls.<br>
One exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described in<br>
more detail in the following text and is illustrated<br>
schematically in the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an outline arrangement of a disconnection<br>
arrangement on a surge arrester,<br>
Figure 2 shows a section through the disconnection arrangement<br>
in the unoperated state,<br>
Figure 3 shows the disconnection arrangement in a first phase<br>
of operation of the disconnection arrangement, and<br>
Figure 4 shows the disconnection arrangement in a second phase<br>
during operation.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates an electrical grid system 1.<br>
The electrical grid system 1 is, for example, in the form of a<br>
high-voltage overhead-line transmission grid system. By way of<br>
example, overvoltages can occur in the electrical grid system 1<br>
as a result of switching processes or lightning strikes. An<br>
output current path 2 with a ground cable is provided in order<br>
to dissipate such overvoltages from a conductor 1 in the<br>
electrical grid system 1. In order to prevent a ground fault<br>
during normal operation of the electrical grid system a surge<br><br>
arrester 3 is connected in the output current path. The surge<br>
arrester 3 may be embodied in many different forms. In the<br>
present case, the surge arrester has an electrically insulating<br>
housing 4 which, for example, is formed from porcelain or form<br>
a plastic composite. By way of example, the housing 4 is<br>
essentially tubular and is provided with ribs on its outside,<br>
in order to make the surge arrester 3 resistant to outdoor use.<br>
At the end, the housing 4 is provided with connecting fittings<br>
to which, on the one hand, the ground cable, which comes from<br>
the electrical conductor of the grid system, is attached. A<br>
disconnection arrangement 5 is attached to the other connecting<br>
fittings. The disconnection arrangement 5, likewise part of the<br>
output current path 2, carries the output current path 2<br>
further to a ground potential. The more detailed design of the<br>
disconnection arrangement 5 and its method of operation will be<br>
described in more detail with reference to Figures 2 to 4.<br>
A stack of metal-oxide blocks 7 is arranged between the<br>
connecting fittings in the interior of the housing 4 of the<br>
surge arrestor 3. These metal-oxide blocks 7 are varistors<br>
which change their electrical impedance as a function of the<br>
voltage applied to them. It is thus possible to switch the<br>
output current path 2 on and off repeatedly by means of the<br>
surge arrester 3. In order to prevent current paths in parallel<br>
with the disconnection arrangement 5, the surge arrester 3 is<br>
installed such that it is electrically isolated from ground<br>
potential. Post insulators 6 are provided for this purpose in<br>
the present case. However, it is also possible to provide for<br>
the surge arrestor to be held, for example, on masts by means<br>
of insulating elements which are designed in another<br>
appropriate manner.<br>
Figure 2 shows a section through a disconnection arrangement 5<br>
according to the invention. The disconnection arrangement 5 has<br>
a first<br><br>
electrode 8 and a second electrode 9. The electrodes 8, 9 are<br>
used to connect the disconnection arrangement 5 in the output<br>
current path 2. The two electrodes are rotationally symmetrical<br>
and are arranged along their rotation axes 10, with a<br>
separation between their ends. An insulating body 11 is<br>
provided in order to separate the two electrodes 8, 9, which<br>
insulating body 11 is essentially hollow-cylindrical and is<br>
likewise aligned coaxially with respect to the rotation axis<br>
10. The second electrode 9 is inserted, with the interposition<br>
of a cover 12, into a recess which is circumferential on the<br>
internal circumference on the insulating body 11. Furthermore,<br>
the insulating body 11 is breached by an impedance element 13,<br>
making contact with the first and the second electrodes 8, 9.<br>
The impedance element 13 is in the form of a non-reactive<br>
resistance. If the insulating material for the insulating body<br>
11 is chosen appropriately, there is no need to use an<br>
additional impedance element 13. The cover 12 rests on the<br>
second electrode 9 and covers it completely in the direction of<br>
the first electrode 8.<br>
The second electrode 9 has a recess 14. The recess 14 is in the<br>
form of a blind hole, which is likewise aligned coaxially with<br>
respect to the rotation axis 10. The recess 14 has an enlarged<br>
cross section at its end facing the first electrode 8. The end<br>
of the recess 14 facing the first electrode is covered by the<br>
cover 12. In this case, the cover 12 is like a shroud, thus<br>
forming a dome which projects in the direction of the first<br>
electrode 8. In this case, the dome sphere has an essentially<br>
truncated-conical shape. The cover 12 makes electrically<br>
conductive contact with the second electrode 9. The projecting<br>
dome in the direction of the first electrode 8 reduces the<br>
volume of an arcing area 15 which is provided in the region<br><br>
of the insulating body 11. A projection like a truncated cone<br>
is integrally formed on the first electrode 8, projecting into<br>
the arcing area 15. The projecting dome of the shroud-like<br>
cover 12 likewise acts as a truncated cone projecting into the<br>
arcing area 15. A first arc foot point zone 16 and a second arc<br>
foot point zone 17 are formed on the truncated-conical<br>
projections on the first electrode 8 and on the cover 12. The<br>
two arc foot point zones 16, 17 in this case have a circular<br>
external contour, with the circle planes being aligned at right<br>
angles to the rotation axis 10 and being arranged at a distance<br>
from one another at the ends.<br>
A gas generator 18 in the form of a blank cartridge is inserted<br>
into the recess 14. The gas generator 18 in this case has an<br>
essentially cylindrical external contour, being provided with a<br>
flange, which enlarges the diameter, in the bottom area. The<br>
gas generator 18 is mounted on a helical spring 19 by its end<br>
14 which faces the bottom area of the recess. The helical<br>
spring 19 is preloaded and presses the bottom of the gas<br>
generator 18 against the cover 12. The cover 12 centers the gas<br>
generator 18 and may also have different shapes. The recess 14<br>
is provided with an enlarged diameter at its end facing the<br>
first electrode 8. It is thus possible for the radial flange in<br>
the bottom area of the gas generator 18 to be moved into the<br>
enlarged cross-sectional area when the helical spring 19 is<br>
compressed. In this case, that area of the recess 14 which has<br>
an enlarged cross section is machined out sufficiently deeply<br>
that any further movement is blocked by the recess 14, which is<br>
in the form of a blind hole, and the end of the gas generator<br>
19 which faces away from the first electrode 8, before striking<br>
the flange on the bottom area of the gas generator 14.<br><br>
The second electrode 9 has a reduced diameter at its end facing<br>
away from the first electrode 8. This results in a projecting<br>
shoulder on the second electrode 9, on which a disk element 20<br>
is placed. The disk element 20 is fixed in its position by a<br>
clasp 21 on the end of the second electrode 9, which is<br>
provided with the reduced diameter. The clasp may, for example,<br>
be in the form of a nut which is screwed onto a corresponding<br>
thread on that end of the second electrode 9 which is provided<br>
with the reduced diameter. Attachments are provided on the<br>
external circumference of the disk element 2 0 and enlarge the<br>
surface of the disk element 20. This ensures that an enlarged<br>
contact surface area can be achieved when the arrangement<br>
illustrated in Figures 2 to 4 is embedded in an electrically<br>
insulating compound, as a result of which the electrically<br>
insulating compound which is intended for embedding adheres in<br>
a torsionally stiff manner.<br>
Furthermore, a gas channel 22 is arranged in the cover 12. The<br>
gas channel 22 is in the form of a hole which is aligned<br>
coaxially with respect to the rotation axis 10. In this case,<br>
the diameter of the hole is chosen to be sufficiently small<br>
that the bottom area of the gas generator 18 closes the gas<br>
channel 22. In order to ensure that the gas channel 22 is<br>
closed, the helical spring 19 presses the gas generator 18<br>
against the cover 12.<br>
While Figure 2 illustrates the disconnection arrangement in the<br>
rest state, Figure 3 illustrates the disconnection arrangement<br>
during operation, that is to say the surge arrester 3 has<br>
considerably reduced its resistance because a limit voltage has<br>
been exceeded in the electrical grid system 1, as a result of<br>
which<br><br>
an output current now flows to ground potential via the output<br>
current path 2, driven by the grid system overvoltage. The<br>
first electrode 8 and the second electrode 9 are part of the<br>
output current path 2. The impedance element 13 and/or the<br>
insulating body 11 are/is provided in an appropriate form in<br>
order to control the potential distribution between the arc<br>
foot point zones 16, 17. With appropriate dielectric<br>
conditions, an arc 23 is formed between the two arc foot point<br>
zones 16, 17. An output current flows. The arc 23 expands gas<br>
that is located in the arcing area 15. This increases the<br>
pressure in the arcing area 15. If the power of the arc 23 is<br>
relatively low and the overvoltage in the electrical grid<br>
system has already been dissipated, the arc 23 is quenched. The<br>
gas which has expanded in the arcing area 15 gradually cools<br>
down again.<br>
However, if this is not the case, then the arc 23 continues to<br>
burn, leading to further expansion of gas in the arcing area<br>
15. As the pressure increases, the expanded gas also forces its<br>
way through the gas channel 22 and presses against the bottom<br>
of the gas generator 18. If the pressure is sufficient, the<br>
spring force of the helical spring 19 is overcome, the helical<br>
spring 19 is compressed, and the gas generator 18 is moved in<br>
its recess 14, which acts as a guide device, in the direction<br>
of the bottom of the recess 14 which is in the form of a blind<br>
hole. Depending on the strength of the arc 23, the gas<br>
generator is moved to a greater or lesser extent from its rest<br>
position. If the overvoltage in the electrical grid system has<br>
decayed again by this time, that is to say the driving force<br>
for the arc 2 3 is no longer present, the arc 23 is quenched,<br>
and the expanded gas cools down. The load on the loaded helical<br>
spring 19 is also decreased, and once again forces the gas<br>
generator<br><br>
against the cover 12, as a result of which it is possible to<br>
assume the initial position as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
However, if this is not the case and a voltage still drives an<br>
output current, then this leads to the arc continuing to burn,<br>
and to further heating of switching gases. As the temperature<br>
in the interior of the disconnection arrangement 3 rises, this<br>
leads to tripping of the gas generator 18 as a result of the<br>
thermal effect, as a result of the pressure effect or as a<br>
result of a combination of the two factors. When the gas<br>
generator 18 is tripped, the assembly, which is at a rigid<br>
angle and originally existed between the two electrodes 8, 9 is<br>
tripped, and the output current path 2 is permanently<br>
interrupted. The disconnection arrangement 3 is in this case<br>
irreversibly broken down into a plurality of parts. When the<br>
disconnection apparatus trips, that is to say when the gas<br>
generator 18 responds and a very large volume of gas is<br>
produced suddenly, associated with this, it is possible for<br>
tripping to take place even while the gas generator 18 is being<br>
moved by the cover 12. However, it is also possible for<br>
tripping to be provided only after the gas generator 18 has<br>
reached the final position.<br>
In general, tripping takes place when a fault is present in the<br>
surge arrester 3.<br><br>
