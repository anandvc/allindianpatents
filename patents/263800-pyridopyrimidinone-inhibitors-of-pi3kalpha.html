PYRTOOPYRIMIDINONE INHIBITORS OF PI3Ka<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the field of protein kinases and inhibitors thereof. In<br>
particular, the. invention relates to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)<br>
signaling pathways, and methods of their use.<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002] The Applicants claim priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to copending Provisional<br>
Applications No. 60/724,571 filed on October 7, 2005 and No. 60/743,719 filed on March<br>
23,2006, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Summary of the Related Art<br>
[0003] The connection between abnormal protein phosphorylation and the cause or<br>
consequence of diseases has been known for over 20 years. Accordingly, protein kinases<br>
have become a very important group of drug targets. See Cohen, Nature, 1:309-315 (2002).<br>
Various protein kinase inhibitors have been used clinically in the treatment of a wide variety<br>
of diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and<br>
stroke. See Cohen, Eur. J. Biochem., 268:5001-5010 (2001).<br>
[0004] The protein kinases are a large and diverse family of enzymes that catalyze<br>
protein phosphorylation and play a critical role in cellular signaling. Protein kinases may<br>
exert positive or negative regulatory effects, depending upon their target protein. Protein<br>
kinases are involved in specific signaling pathways which regulate cell functions such as,<br>
but not limited to, metabolism, cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, vascular function,<br>
apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Malfunctions of cellular signaling have been associated with<br>
many diseases, the most characterized of which include cancer and diabetes. The regulation<br>
of signal transduction by cytokines and the association of signal molecules with<br>
protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been well documented. Similarly, the<br>
connection between diabetes and related conditions, and deregulated levels of protein<br>
kinases, has been demonstrated. See e.g., Sridhar et al. Pharmaceutical Research,<br>
17(11):1345-1353 (2000). Viral infections and the conditions related thereto have also been<br>
associated with the regulation of protein kinases. Park et al. Cell 101 (7), 777-787 (2000).<br>
[0005] Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PBKct), a dual specificity protein kinase, is<br>
composed of an 85 kDa regulatory subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein<br>
encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
Ptdlns, PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. PTEN, a tumor suppressor which inhibits cell growth<br>
through multiple mechanisms, can dephosphorylate PIP3, the major product of PDGCA.<br>
PIP3, in turn, is required for translocation of protein kinase B (AKT1, PKB) to the cell<br>
membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by upstream kinases. The effect of<br>
PTEN on cell death is mediated through the PIK3CA/AKT1 pathway.<br>
[0006] PBKa has been implicated in the control of cytoskeletal reorganization,<br>
apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, proliferation and differentiation processes. Increased copy<br>
number and expression of PIK3CA is associated with a number of malignancies such as<br>
ovarian cancer (Campbell et al., Cancer Res 2004, 64, 7678-7681; Levine et al., Clin<br>
Cancer Res 2005, 11, 2875-2878; Wang et al., Hum Mutat 2005, 25, 322; Lee et al.,<br>
Gynecol Oncol 2005, 97, 26-34), cervical cancer, breast cancer (Bachman, et al. Cancer<br>

Eur J Cancer 2005, 41, 1649-1654), endometrial cancer (Oda et al. Cancer Res. 2005, 65,<br>
10669-10673), gastric carcinomas (Byun et al., Int J Cancer 2003, 104, 318-327; Li et al.,<br>
supra; Velho et al., supra; Lee et al., Oncogene 2005, 24, 1477-1480), hepatocellular<br>
carcinoma (Lee et al., id), small and non-small cell lung cancer (Tang et al., Lung Cancer<br>
2006, 51, 181-191; Massion et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2004, 170, 1088-1094),<br>
thyroid carcinoma (Wu et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2005, 90, 4688-4693), acute<br>
myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Sujobert et al., Blood 1997, 106, 1063-1066), chronic<br>
myelogenous leukemia (CML) (Hickey and Cotter J Biol Chem 2006, 281, 2441-2450), and<br>
glioblastomas (Hartmann et al. Acta Neuropathol (Bert) 2005,109, 639-642; Samuels et al.,<br>
supra).<br>
[0007] In view of the important role of PI3Kct in biological processes and disease states,<br>
inhibitors of this protein kinase are desirable.<br>

[0018] The symbol "-" means a single bond, "=" means a double bond, "s" means a<br>
triple bond, "	" means a single or double bond. The symbol "&gt;AWV" refers to a group<br>
on a double-bond as occupying either position on the terminus of a double bond to which<br>
the symbol is attached; that is, the geometry, E- or Z-, of the double bond is ambiguous.<br>
When a group is depicted removed from its parent formula, the "'-" symbol will be used<br>
at the end of the bond which was theoretically cleaved in order to separate the group from<br>
its parent structural formula.<br>
[0019] When chemical structures are depicted or described, unless explicitly stated<br>
otherwise, all carbons are assumed to have hydrogen substitution to conform to a valence of<br>
four. For example, in the structure on the left-hand side of the schematic below there are<br>
nine hydrogens implied. The nine hydrogens are depicted in the right-hand structure.<br>
Sometimes a particular atom in a structure is described in textual formula as having a<br>
hydrogen or hydrogens as substitution (expressly defined hydrogen), for example, -<br>
CH2CH2-. It is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned<br>
descriptive techniques are common in the chemical arts to provide brevity and simplicity to<br>
description of otherwise complex structures.<br><br><br><br>
[0020] If a group "R" is depicted as "floating" on a ring system, as for example in the •<br>
formula:<br><br>
then, unless otherwise defined, a substituent "R" may reside on any atom of the ring system,<br>
assuming replacement of a depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen from one of the<br>
ring atoms, so long as a stable structure is formed.<br>
[0021] If a group "R" is depicted as floating on a fused ring system, as for example in<br>
the formulae:<br><br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/044813	PCT/US2006/039734<br>
then, unless otherwise defined, a substituent "R" may reside on any atom of the fused ring<br>
system, assuming replacement of a depicted hydrogen (for example the -NH- in the formula<br>
above), implied hydrogen (for example as in the formula above, where the hydrogens are<br>
not shown but understood to be present), or expressly defined hydrogen (for example where<br>
in the formula above, "Z" equals =CH-) from one of the ring atoms, so long as a stable<br>
structure is formed. In the example depicted, the "R" group may reside on either the 5-<br>
membered or the 6-membered ring of the fused ring system. In the formula depicted above,<br>
when y is 2 for example, then the two "R's" may reside on any two atoms of the ring<br>
system, again assuming each replaces a depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen on<br>
the ring.<br>
[0022] When a group "R" is depicted as existing on a ring system containing saturated<br>
carbons, as for example in the formula:<br><br>
where, in this example, "y" can be more than one, assuming each replaces a currently<br>
depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen on the ring; then, unless otherwise<br>
defined, where the resulting structure is stable, two "R's" may reside on the same carbon. A<br>
simple example is when R is a methyl group; there can exist a geminal dimethyl on a carbon<br>
of the depicted ring (an "annular" carbon). In another example, two R's on the same carbon,<br>
including that carbon, may form a ring, thus creating a spirocyclic ring (a "spirocyclyl"<br>
group) structure with the depicted ring as for example in the formula:<br><br>
[0023] "Acyl" means a -C(0)R radical where R is optionally substituted alkyl,<br>
optionally substituted alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl,<br>
heteroaralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkylalkyl, as defined herein, e.g., acetyl,<br>
trifluoromethylcarbonyl, or 2-methoxyethylcarbonyl, and the like.<br>
[0024] "Acylamino" means a -NRRi-iadical where R is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl, or<br>
alkoxy and R' is acyl, as defined herein.<br>
[0025] "Acyloxy" means an -OR radical where R is acyl, as defined herein, e.g.<br>
cyanomethylcarbonyloxy, and the like.<br>
[0026] "Administration" and variants thereof (e.g., "administering" a compound) in<br>
reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/044813	PCT/US2006/039734<br>
the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the<br>
invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active<br>
agents (e.g., surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, etc.), "administration" and its variants<br>
are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or<br>
prodrug thereof and other agents.<br>
[0027] "Alkenyl" means a means a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of one to six<br>
carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to 6 carbon atoms<br>
which radical contains at least one double bond, e.g., ethenyl, propenyl, l-but-3-enyl, and<br>
l-pent-3-enyl, and the like.<br>
[0028] "Alkoxy" means an -OR group where R is alkyl group as defined herein.<br>

spirocyclyl can be carbocyclic or heteroalicyclic.<br><br>
[0063] "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said<br>

[0079] "Kinase-dependent diseases or conditions" refer to pathologic conditions that<br>
depend on the activity of one or more protein kinases. Kinases either directly or indirectly<br>
participate in the signal transduction pathways of a variety of cellular activities including<br>
proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation and invasion. Diseases associated with<br>
kinase activities include tumor growth, the pathologic neovascularization that supports solid<br>
tumor growth, and associated with other diseases where excessive local vascularization is<br>
involved such as ocular diseases (diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration,<br>
and the like) and inflammation (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and the like).<br>
[0080] While not wishing to be bound to theory, phosphatases can also play a role in<br>
"kinase-dependent diseases or conditions" as cognates of kinases; that is, kinases<br>
phosphorylate and phosphatases dephosphorylate, for example protein substrates. Therefore<br>
compounds of the invention, while modulating kinase activity as described herein, may also<br>
modulate, either directly or indirectly, phosphatase activity. This additional modulation, if<br>
present, may be synergistic (or not) to activity of compounds of the invention toward a<br>

Formula I.<br>
[00116] Another aspect of the invention is directed to employing the compounds of the<br>
invention in a method of screening for candidate agents that bind to, for example PDKa.<br>
The protein is bound to a support, and a compound of the invention is added to the assay.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of the invention is bound to the support and the protein is<br>
added. Classes of candidate agents among which novel binding agents may be sought<br>
include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical<br>
libraries, peptide analogs, etc. Of particular interest are screening assays for candidate<br>
agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays may be used for<br>
this purpose, including labeled 'in vitro proteW-protein binding assays, electrophoretic<br>
mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation<br>
assays, etc.) and the like.<br>
[00117] The determination of the binding of the candidate agent to, for example, PBKa<br>
can be done in a number of ways. In one example, the candidate agent (the compound of the<br>
invention) is labeled, for example, with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety and binding<br>
determined directly. For example, this may be done by attaching all or a portion of the<br>
PI3Ka protein to a solid support, adding a labeled agent (for example a compound of the<br>
invention in which at least one atom has been replaced by a detectable isotope), washing off<br>
excess reagent, and determining whether the amount of the label is that present on the solid<br>
support. Various blocking and washing steps may be utilized as is known in the art.<br>
[00118] The term "labeled" as used herein is meant to include both direct and indirect<br>
labeling with a compound that provides a detectable signal, for example, radioisotope,<br>
fluorescent tag, enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescent<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
tag, or specific binding molecules, and the like. Specific binding molecules include pairs,<br>
such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin, and the like. For the specific<br>
binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule<br>
which provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures, as outlined above. The<br>
label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal.<br>
[00119] In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. For example,<br>
PI3Ka protein may be labeled at tyrosine positions using 125I, or with fluorophores.<br>
Alternatively, more than one component may be labeled with different labels; using 125I for<br>
the proteins, for example, and a fluorophor for the candidate agents.<br>
[00120] The compounds of the invention may also be used as competitors to screen for<br>
additional drug candidates. The terms "candidate bioactive agent" or "drug candidate" or<br>
grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, e.g., protein, oligopeptide,<br>
small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for bioactivity.<br>
They may be capable of directly or indirectly altering the cellular proliferation phenotype or<br>
the expression of a cellular proliferation sequence, including both nucleic acid sequences<br>
and protein sequences. In other cases, alteration of cellular proliferation protein binding<br>
. and/or activity is screened. In the case where protein binding or activity is screened, some<br>
embodiments exclude molecules already known to bind to that particular protein.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of assays described herein include candidate agents, which do not<br>
bind the target protein in its endogenous native state, termed herein as "exogenous" agents.<br>
In one example, exogenous agents further exclude antibodies to PDKa.<br>
[00121] Candidate agents can encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically<br>
they are organic molecules having a molecular weight of more than about 100 and less than<br>
about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural<br>
interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding and lipophilic binding, and<br>
typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl, ether, or carboxyl group, for<br>
example at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often<br>
comprise carbocyclic or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures<br>
substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also<br>
found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines,<br>
pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs, or combinations thereof.<br>
[00122] Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries<br>
of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including<br>
expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in<br>
the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced.<br>
Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily<br>
modified through conventional chemical, physical and - biochemical means. Known<br>
pharmacological agents may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications,<br>
such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidification to produce structural analogs.<br>
[00123] In one example, the binding of the candidate agent is determined through the use<br>
of competitive binding assays. In this example, the competitor is a binding moiety known to<br>
bind to PDKa, such as an antibody, peptide, binding partner, ligand, etc. Under certain<br>
circumstances, there may be competitive binding as between the candidate agent and the<br>
binding moiety, with the binding moiety displacing the candidate agent.<br>
[00124] In some embodiments, the candidate agent is labeled. Either the candidate agent,<br>
or the competitor, or both, is added first to PBKa protein for a time sufficient to allow<br>
binding, if present. Incubations may be performed at any temperature that facilitates optimal<br>
activity, typically between 4°C and 40°C.<br>
[00125] Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but may also be optimized<br>
to facilitate rapid high throughput screening. Typically between 0.1 and 1 hour will be<br>
sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is<br>
then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate<br>
binding.<br>
[00126] In one example, the competitor is added first, followed by the candidate agent.<br>
Displacement of the competitor is an indication the candidate agent is binding to PDKa and<br>
thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of the PDKa. In this<br>
embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, for example, if the competitor is<br>
labeled, the presence of label in the wash solution indicates displacement by the agent.<br>
Alternatively, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support<br>
indicates displacement.<br>
[00127] In an alternative embodiment, the candidate agent is added first, with incubation<br>
and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor may<br>
indicate the candidate agent is bound to PDKa with a higher affinity. Thus, if the candidate<br>
agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of competitor<br>
binding, may indicate the candidate agent is capable of binding to PDKa.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
[00128] It may be of value to identify the binding site of PBKcc. This can be done in a<br>
variety of ways. In one embodiment, once PI3Ka is identified as binding to the candidate<br>
agent, the PBKa is fragmented or modified and the assays repeated to identify the<br>
necessary components for binding.<br>
[0012?] Modulation is tested by screening for candidate agents capable of modulating the .<br>
activity of PBKcc comprising the steps of combining a candidate agent with PBKa, as<br>
above, and determining an alteration in the biological activity of the PBKa. Thus, in this<br>
embodiment, the candidate agent should both bind to (although this may not be necessary),<br>
and alter its biological or biochemical activity as defined herein. The methods include both<br>
in vitro screening methods and in vivo screening of cells for alterations in cell viability,<br>
morphology, and the like.<br>
[00130] Alternatively, differential screening may be used to identify drug candidates that<br>
bind to native PBKa, but cannot bind to modified PBKa.<br>
[00131] Positive controls and negative controls can be used in the assays. For example,<br>
all control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically<br>
significant results. Incubation of samples is for a time sufficient for the binding of the agent<br>
to the protein. Following incubation, samples are washed free of non-specifically bound	<br>
material and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determined. For example, where<br>
a radiolabel is employed, the samples can be counted in a scintillation counter to determine<br>
the amount of bound compound.<br>
[00132] A variety of other reagents can be included in the screening assays. These<br>
include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g., albumin, detergents, etc which may be used<br>
to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background<br>
interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as<br>
protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may be used. The<br>
mixture of components can be added in any order that provides for the requisite binding.<br>
[00133] One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that certain crystallized,<br>
proteiAT-ligand complexes, in particular PBKa-ligand-ligand complexes, and their<br>
corresponding x-ray structure coordinates can be used to reveal new structural information<br>
useful for understanding the biological activity of kinases as described herein. As well, the<br>
key structural features of the aforementioned proteins, particularly, the shape of the ligand<br>
binding site, are useful in methods for designing or identifying selective modulators of<br>
kinases and in solving the structures of other proteins with similar features. Such protein-<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
ligand complexes, having compounds of the invention as their ligand component, are an<br>
aspect of the invention.<br>
[00134] As well, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that such suitable x-ray<br>
quality crystals can be used as part of a method of identifying a candidate agent capable of<br>
binding to and modulating the activity of kinases. Such methods.may be characterized by<br>
the following aspects: a) introducing into a suitable computer program, information defining<br>
a ligand binding domain of a kinase in a conformation (e.g. as defined by x-ray structure<br>
coordinates obtained from suitable x-ray quality crystals as described above) wherein the<br>
computer program creates a model of the three dimensional structures of the ligand binding<br>
domain, b) introducing a model of the three dimensional structure of a candidate agent in<br>
the computer program, c) superimposing the model of the candidate agent on the model of<br>
the ligand binding domain, and d) assessing whether the candidate agent model fits spatially<br>
into the ligand binding domain. Aspects a-d are not necessarily carried out in the<br>
aforementioned order. Such methods may further entail: performing rational drug design<br>
with the model of the three-dimensional structure, and selecting a potential candidate agent<br>
in conjunction with computer modeling.<br>
[00135], Additionally, one skilled in the art would appreciate that such methods may<br>
further entail: employing a candidate agent, so-determined to fit spatially into the ligand<br>
binding domain, in a biological activity assay for kinase modulation, and determining<br>
whether said candidate agent modulates kinase activity in the assay. Such methods may also<br>
include administering the candidate agent, determined to modulate kinase activity, to a<br>
mammal suffering from a condition treatable by kinase modulation, such as those described<br>
above.<br>
[00136] Also, one skilled in the art would appreciate that compounds of the invention can<br>
be used in a method of evaluating the ability of a test agent to associate with a molecule or<br>
molecular complex comprising a ligand binding domain of a kinase. Such a method may be<br>
characterized by the following aspects: a) creating a computer model of a kinase binding<br>
pocket using structure coordinates obtained from suitable x-ray quality crystals of the<br>
kinase, b) employing computational algorithms to perform a fitting operation between the<br>
test agent and the computer model of the binding pocket, and c) analyzing the results of the<br>
fitting operation to quantify the association between the test agent and the computer model<br>
of the binding pocket.<br>

General Administration<br>
[00138] In one aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
an inhibitor of PI3K according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
excipient, or diluent. In certain other specific embodiments, administration is by the oral<br>
route. Administration of the compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be<br>
carried out via any of the accepted modes of administration or agents for serving similar<br>
utilities. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, or subcutaneous), topically, transdermally, intravaginally, intravesically,<br>
intracistemally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid<br>
dosage forms, such as for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin<br>
capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, specifically in unit<br>
dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages.	_.<br>
[00139] The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient<br>
and a compound of the invention as the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include<br>
carriers and adjuvants, etc.<br>
[00140] Adjuvants include preserving, wetting, suspending, sweetening, flavoring,<br>
perfuming, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms<br>
can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic<br>
agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2007/044813	PCT/US2006/039734<br>
injectable, pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying<br>
absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[00141] If desired, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain<br>
minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering<br>
agents, antioxidants, and the like, such as, for example, citric acid, sorbitan monolaurate,<br>
Methanolamine oleate, butylalted hydroxytoluene, etc.<br>
[00142] The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug<br>
administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or<br>
capsules) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently, pharmaceutical<br>
formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based<br>
upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e.,<br>
decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active<br>
material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684<br>
describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is<br>
pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface<br>
modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that<br>
exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.<br>
[00143] Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically<br>
acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions,<br>
and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles<br>
include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the<br>
like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic<br>
esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a<br>
coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of<br>
dispersions and by the use of surfactants.<br>
[00144] One specific route of administration is oral, using a convenient daily dosage<br>
regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of severity of the disease-state to be<br>
treated.<br>
[00145] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at<br>
least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium<br>
phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
mannitol, and silicip acid, (b) binders, as for example, cellulose derivatives, starch,<br>
alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and gum acacia, (c) humectants, as for<br>
example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate,<br>
potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, croscarmellose sodium, complex silicates, and sodium<br>
carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for<br>
example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl<br>
alcohol, and glycerol monostearate, magnesium stearate and the like (h) adsorbents, as for<br>
example, kaolin and bentonite, and (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering<br>
agents.<br>
[00146] Solid dosage forms as described above can be prepared with coatings and shells,<br>
such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. They may contain pacifying<br>
agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or<br>
compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of<br>
embedded compositions that can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active<br>
compounds can also be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the<br>
above-mentioned excipients.<br>
[00147] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. Such dosage forms are prepared, for<br>
example, by dissolving, dispersing, etc., a compound(s) of the invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier,<br>
such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like;<br>
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl<br>
carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol,<br>
1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide; oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil,<br>
corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol,<br>
polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan; or mixtures of these substances, and<br>
the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.<br>
[00148] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending<br>
agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and<br>
sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar<br>
and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.<br>

{00149] Compositions for rectal administrations are, for example, suppositories that can<br>
be prepared by mixing the compounds of the present invention with for example suitable<br>
non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethyleneglycol or a<br>
suppository wax, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at body temperature<br>
and therefore, melt while in a suitable body cavity and release the active component therein.<br>
[00150] Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include<br>
ointments, powders, sprays, and inhalants. The active component is admixed under sterile<br>
conditions with a physiologically acceptable carrier and any preservatives, buffers, or<br>
propellants as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, and<br>
solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
[00151] Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in<br>
aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.<br>
[00152] Generally, depending on the intended mode of administration, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions will contain about 1% to about 99% by weight of<br>
a compound(s) of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and 99% to<br>
1% by weight of a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. In one example, the composition will<br>
be between about 5% and about 75% by weight of a compound(s) of the invention,, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the rest being suitable pharmaceutical<br>
excipients.<br>
[00153] Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent,<br>
to those skilled in this art; for example, see RemingtoATs Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
Ed., (Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990). The composition to be administered<br>
will, in any event, contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treatment of a disease-state in<br>
accordance with the teachings of this invention.<br>
[00154] The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or<br>
solvates, are administered in a therapeutically effective amount which will vary depending<br>
upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the<br>
metabolic stability and length of action of the compound, the age, body weight, general<br>
health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the<br>
severity of the particular disease-states, and the host undergoing therapy. The compounds of<br>
the present invention can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of about<br>
0.1 to about 1,000 mg per day. For a normal human adult having a body weight of about 70<br>
kilograms, a dosage in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
per day is an example. The specific dosage used, however, can vary. For example, the<br>
dosage can depend on a number of factors including the requirements of the patient, the<br>
severity of the condition being treated, and the pharmacological activity of the compound<br>
being used. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular patient is well known to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[00155] If formulated as a fixed dose* such combination products employ the compounds<br>
of this invention within the dosage range described above and the other pharmaceuticaUy<br>
active agent(s) within its approved dosage range. Compounds of the instant invention may<br>
alternatively be used sequentially with known pharmaceutically acceptable agent(s) when a<br>
combination formulation is inappropriate.<br>
[00156] Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of Formula<br>
I are described below in the Pharmaceutical Composition Examples.<br>
UTILITY<br>
[00157] Certain compounds of this invention have been tested using the assay described<br>
in Biological Example 1 and have been determined to be PI3K inhibitors. As such<br>
compounds of Formula I are useful for treating diseases, particularly cancer in which PI3K<br>
activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptomatology of the disease. For example,<br>
cancer in which PI3K activity contributes to its pathology and/or symptomatology include<br>
breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, endometrial cancer, gastric carcinoma,<br>
glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,<br>
melanoma, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate carcinoma, acute<br>
myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or thyroid<br>
carcinoma	i<br>

illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of this invention can be synthesized,<br>
and various modifications to these schemes can be made and will be suggested to one<br>
skilled in the art having referred to this disclosure. The starting materials and the<br>
intermediates of the reaction may be isolated and purified if desired using conventional<br>
techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation, crystallization,<br>

means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
[00162] Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein take place at<br>
atmospheric pressure and over a temperature range from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more<br>
specifically from about 0 °C. to about 125 °C and more specifically at about room (or<br>
ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 °C. Unless otherwise stated (as in the case of an<br>
hydrogenation), all reactions are performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen.<br>
[00163] Prodrugs can be prepared by techniques known to one skilled in the art. These<br>
techniques generally modify appropriate functional groups in a given compound. These<br>
modified functional groups regenerate original functional groups by routine manipulation or<br>
in vivo. Amides and esters of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared<br>
according to conventional methods. A thorough discussion of prodrugs is provided in T.<br>

incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts, may have<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms or quaternized nitrogen atoms in their structure. Compounds of<br>
Formula I that may be prepared through the syntheses described herein may exist as single<br>
stereoisomers, racemates, and as mixtures of enantiomers and diastereomers. The<br>
compounds may also exist as geometric isomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates<br>
and mixtures thereof, and geometric isomers are intended to be within the scope of this<br>
invention. Some of the compounds of the invention may exist as tautomers. For example,<br>
where a ketone or aldehyde is present, the molecule may exist in the enol form; where an<br>
amide is present, the molecule may exist as the imidic acid; and where an enamine is<br>
present, the molecule may exist as an imine. All such tautomers are within the scope of the<br>
invention. In particular, imidazol-5-yl and pyrazol-5-yl each can also exist in their<br>
respective tautomeric forms imidazol-4-yl and pyrazol-3-yl. Regardless of which structure<br>
or which terminology is used, each tautomer is included within the scope of the Invention.<br>
[00164] The present invention also includes N-oxide derivatives and protected<br>
derivatives of compounds of Formula I. For example, when compounds of Formula I<br>
contain an oxidizable nitrogen atom, the nitrogen atom can be converted to an N-oxide by<br>
methods well known in the art. When compounds of Formula I contain groups such as<br>
hydroxy, carboxy, thiol or any group containing a nitrogen atom(s), these groups can be<br>
protected with a suitable "protecting group" or "protective group". A comprehensive list of<br>
suitable protective groups can be found in T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The protected derivatives of compounds of Formula J can be<br>
"prepared by methods well known in the art.<br>
[00165] Methods for the preparation and/or separation and isolation of single<br>
stereoisomers from racemic mixtures or non-racemic mixtures of stereoisomers are well<br>
known in the art. For example, optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers may be prepared using<br>
chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. Enantiomers<br>
(R- and S-isomers) may be resolved by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
for example by: formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which may be separated,<br>
for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which may<br>
be separated, for example, by crystallization, selective reaction of one enantiomer with an<br>
enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by<br>
52<br><br>
WO 2007/044813<br><br>
PCT/US2006/039734<br><br>
separation of the modified, and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid<br>
chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with<br>
a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where<br>
a desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation<br>
procedures described above, a further step may be required to liberate the desired<br>
enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomer may be synthesized by asymmetric<br>
synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents or by converting<br>
on enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. For a mixture of enantiomers,<br>
enriched in a particular enantiomer, the major component enantiomer may be further<br>
enriched (with concomitant loss in yield) by recrystallization.<br>
[00166] In addition, the compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated as<br>
well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol,<br>
and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated<br>
forms for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[00167] The chemistry for the preparation of the compounds of this invention is known<br>
to those skilled in the art. In fact, there may be more than one process to prepare the<br>
compounds of the invention. For specific examples, see M. Barvian et al. J. Med. Chem.<br>

formula 10 at room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred for overnight or less. After<br>
neutralizing, 11 is collected through filtration and followed by drying under vacuum. 11 is<br>

further purification.<br>
[00170] An intermediate of formula 2 is prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula<br>

for approximately overnight or less as needed for the reaction to go to completion to form 3.<br>
After completion the residue is triturated with acetone. The intermediate 3 is then reacted in<br>
a solvent, such as DMA, with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a base, such as triemylamine,<br>
and in the presence of a catalyst, such as Pd(OAc)2, and (+)BINAP. The reaction is heated<br>

and treated with a base such as triethylamine. The mixture is then washed with water and<br>
dried over a drying agent such as Na2SC&gt;4 to yield 6.<br>
[00173] A Suzuki coupling is then performed using 6 reacting with a boronic acid (or<br>
ester) of formula ROH in a solvents) such as a DME-H2O mixture, in the presence of<br>
a catalyst such as Pd(dpppf) and a base such as triethylamine at room temperature. The<br>

temperature, the reaction mixture is partitioned with water and ethyl acetate. After<br>
separation, the organic layer is dried over a drying agent such as Na2SC&gt;4 to yield 7.<br>

DCM at room temperature allowing to stir for approximately 4 h. After removal of the<br>
solvent under reduced pressure, the product is treated with with an amine of formula R2NH2<br>
in a solvent such as dioxane and stirred at room temperature for approximately overnight to<br>

such as water or THF and.triethylamine at 0 °C to form 10. After removal of the solvent<br>
under reduced pressure, the intermediate 10 is then reacted with lithium aluminum hydride<br>
in a solvent such as THF at 0 °C. After quenching and aqueous workup, solvent removal<br>
provided crystalline 11 without further purification. Treatment of 11 with manganese (H)<br>
dioxide in a solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform at room temperature provided<br>
aldehyde 12 upon filtration and solvent removal. A Wittig reaction with aldehyde 12 can be<br>
employed with (carbethoxymethylene)triphenylphosphorane in refluxing THF to provide<br>
the common intermediate 4. 4 can then be used to prepare a Compounf of Frmula I using<br>

then treated with iodine monochloride in a solvent such as methanol at around 0 °C and<br>
allowed to react for approximately overnight or less as needed for the reaction to go to<br>
completion to form 15. After completion the residue is triturated with acetone. The<br>
intermediate 15 is then reacted in a solvent, such as DMA, with ethyl acrylate in the<br>
presence of a base, such as triethylamine, and in the presence of a catalyst, such as<br>
Pd(OAc)2, and (+)BINAP. The reaction is heated to approximately 100 °C and allowed to<br>
react for approximately overnight or less as needed for the reaction to go to completion to<br>

WO 2007/044813	PCT/US2006/039734<br>
Formula I can then be prepared from 16 by using the same reaction conditions as described<br>
in Scheme 1 (starting at the point of the preparation of 5 from 4).<br>
[00179] A compound of the invention where R1 is optionally substituted alkyl, R4 is<br>

alternatively be prepared according to Scheme 4.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br>
[00180] An intermediate of formula 20 is prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula 19 with neat POCI3 and heating. 20 is then treated with a primary amine R'lSDHb in a<br>
solvent such as water or THF and triethylamine at 0 °C to form 21. After removal of the<br>
solvent under reduced pressure, the intermediate 21 is then reacted with lithium aluminum<br>
hydride in a solvent such as THF at 0 °C. After quenching and aqueous workup, solvent<br>
removal provided crystalline 22 without further purification. Treatment of 22 with<br>
manganese (II) dioxide in a solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform at room<br>
temperature provided aldehyde 23 upon filtration and solvent removal. A Knovenegal-type<br>
condensation with 23 and an arylacetonitrile in the presence of a base such as potassium<br>
carbonate or sodium hydroxide in a protic solvent provides the cyclized imine 24.<br>
Acetylation of the imine with acetic anhydride is required prior to hydrolysis which takes<br>
place in the presence of aqueous acid and heating to afford 25. Subsequently, 25 can be,<br>
oxidized to the corresponding sulfone with TK-CPBA at room temperature and displaced<br>
with ammonium to provide I.<br>

[00253] PDKa activity is measured as the percent of ATP consumed following the<br>
kinase reaction using luciferase-luciferW-coupled chemiluminescence. Reactions were<br>
conducted in 384-well white, medium binding microtiter plates (Greiner). Kinase reactions<br>
were initiated by combining test compounds, ATP, substrate (PIP2), and kinase in a 20 uL<br>
volume in a buffer solution. The standard PDKalpha assay buffer is composed 50 mM Tris,<br>
pH 7.5,1 mM EGTA,T0 mM MgCI2, 1 mM DTT and 0.03%XHAPS7 The standard assay<br>
concentrations for enzyme, ATP, and substrate are 0.5-1.1 nM, luM, and 7.5 uM,<br>
respectively. The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for approximately<br>
2 h. Following the kinase reaction, a 10 uL aliquot of luciferase-luciferin mix (Promega<br>
Kinase-Glo) was added and the chemiluminescence signal measured using a Victor2 plate<br>
reader (Perkin Elmer). Total ATP consumption was limited to 40-60% and IC50 values of<br>
control compounds correlate well with literature references.<br>
