				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a waste water recycling apparatus for use in a solvent extraction process of oil from oil seeds or any, oil bearing material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is generally known in the art to extract oil from oil seeds or oil bearing material using an edible solvent such as hexane. For this purpose, it is known to feed the raw meal containing the oil seeds and hexane into an extractor, which are then mixed to form a miscella. Oil is then separated from hexane To cause a separation of hexane from oil, the system comprises condensers operating under vacuum conditions. For this purpose, a water ring vacuum pump is employed,. To run such a vacuum pump, approximately 20 1/min of water is required.<br>
In the known construction, water is fed to the vacuum pump, and where hexane gets mixed with water. The mixture of water and hexane flows to a water separator, and due to the density difference between water and hexane, a separation is caused. However, trace amounts of water may still be present with water. Thus, in the known apparatuses, water from the separator is fed to the waste water boiler, where water is heated from 30 to 90°C, and where the trace amounts of hexane is recovered and water is discharged as an effluent<br>
Several disadvantages are associated with such a known construction of a waste water recycling apparatus. One such disadvantage is the loss of heat energy required to heat water to 90°C. Yet another disadvantage was the discharge of the effluent. Still another disadvantage is the considerable requirement of fresh water to run the vacuum pump.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a waste water recycling apparatus for use in solvent extraction process of oil from oil seeds or oil bearing material.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a waste water recycling apparatus for use in solvent extraction process of oil from oil seeds or oil bearing material which avoids the use of heat energy as employed in the known process.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a waste water recycling apparatus for use in solvent extraction process of oil from oil seeds or oil bearing material which provides a substantial saving in the consumption of water in the solvent extraction system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved waste water recycling apparatus adaptable to a solvent extraction plant for separating oil bearing materials including water from oil, the plant having atleast one extractor being fed with a raw meal containing oil seeds and an edible solvent, the apparatus comprising atleast one vacuum pump operably connected to a proximal end of a separator for separating the edible solvent from oil; a cooler for condensation of a vapour containing atleast a residual edible solvent and waste water being fed from the separator for condensation; a water pump for collecting water from a water pond for delivery to the cooler; the distal end of the separator is directly connected to the cooler, and in that a recirculating pump disposed between the water pump and the vacuum pump, and being connected to the cooler and the vacuum pump for supply of condensed liquid from the cooler to the separator via the vacuum pump .<br>
A waste water recycling apparatus for use in a solvent extraction system of oil comprising a water separator having an inlet for receiving the spent water from the vacuum pump, characterized in that said water separator has an outlet connected to a cooler, said cooler having an outlet connected to the inlet of the vacuum pump through a water circulation pump.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the outlet of the water separator is no longer connected to the waste water boiler but to the inlet of a cooler. The water is cooled in the cooler and recycled to the vacuum pump through a water circulation pump. Thus, it will be apparent that one of the distinct advantages derived by the apparatus of the present invention is that no heat energy is required to heat the spent water from the water separator, as known from the known art. Yet another advantage is that due to the recirculation of water, a less quantity of fresh water is required in the solvent oil extraction system. Yet another advantage is that an effluent is avoided.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS;<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1    shows a schematic view of the waste water recycling apparatus of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. I, vacuum pump 1 normally is provided in a solvent extraction system of oil from oil seeds or oil bearing material. One of the objects of the present invention is to provide minimum modifications in the existing plants so that the apparatus can conveniently be installed in such plants, and simultaneously provide the advantages described hereinabove. Thus vacuum pump 1 has an outlet la connected to the inlet 2a of a water separator 2. The water may also have the presence of hexane, which is separated at separator 2 due to the density difference between water and hexane Water separator 2 has an outlet 2b for discharge of waster water. In the known construction, separator outlet 2b was connected to a waste<br>
"7<br>
water boiler,, and where water was heated and then discharged as effluent.<br>
In distinction in the present invention, water outlet 2b is connected to the inlet 3a of a cooler 3, and where the water discharged from water separator is cooled.<br>
Cooler 3 has an outlet 3 a connected to a water recirculation pump 4 for feeding cooled water to the inlet Ib of vacuum pump 1.<br>
As shown in Fig 1, a water pond 5 may be connected to cooler 3. A pump 6 connects pond 5 to cooler 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim<br>
