				<td>NOVEL AMINOBENZOPHENONE COMPOUNDS <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel type of aminobenzophenones and to their use in therapy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aminobenzophenones are well known from the scientific as well as the patent literature. Thus, WO 98/32730, WO 01/05746, WO 01/05749, WO 01/05751, WO 01/05744 and WO 01/05745 all disclose compounds with common core structure<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein the phenyl ring C is substituted by amine derivatives. Moreover, WO 01/42189 and WO 02/076447 disclose compounds with a similar structure, but with no nitrogen substituent in phenyl ring C. Finally, WO 01/90074 and WO 02/083622 disclose compounds where the phenyl rings A and C respectively are replaced by heterocycles. The compounds disclosed in these patent application are indicated to be inhibitors of interleukin 1ß (IL-lß) and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-α) secretion in vitro, which makes the compounds potentially useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases<br>
where the production of cytokines is involved in the pathogenesis. Allegedly, aminobenzophenones exert their effect by inhibiting the p38 MAP klnase, which In turn inhibits the production of IL-lß and TNF-α.<br>
The preparation ot structurally related aminobenzophenones useful as dyes for textiles is disclosed in Man-Made Text.,India (1987), 30(6), 27S.-6, Man-Made Text. India (1986), 29(5), 224-30, and Man-Made Text. India (1985), 28(11), 425, 427-9, 431.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has surprisingly been found that novel aminobenzophenone derivatives are potent inhibitors of interleukin 1ß (IL-lß) and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-α) secretion in vitro and In vivo, suggesting their utility in the treatment and/or prevention of<br>
inflammatory diseases and other conditions where the secretion and modulation of<br>
proinflammatory cytokines is involved in the pathogenesis.<br>
It has been found that aminobenzophenone derivatives of the present invention exert<br>
their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting or downregulating MAP kinases, more<br>
specifically the p38 MAP kinase, a stress-activated protein which is an important<br>
element of the signal transduction pathway leading to the production of<br>
proinflammatory cytokines.<br>
The aminobenzophenone derivatives of the present invention may furthermore be<br>
useful in the treatment of cancer or ophthalmic diseases or conditions. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a compound of general formula I<br>

"p38 MAP kinase" is a stress-activated protein kinase existing in several isoforms (p38a, p38p, p38p2, p38y and p388). The p38 MAP kinase is activated by different stimuli including heat, chemical, osmotic, pH and oxidative stress, growth factor withdrawal, high or low glucose and ultraviolet radiation. p38 is also stimulated by agents that mediate the initial physiological response to injury, infection and inflammation, such as IPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-lß, TNF-α, FasL, CD40L and TGF-ß. Like other MAP kinases, p38 is phosphorylated by kinases, including MKK3, MEK6 and MKK6, on a threonme ana tyrosihe in an activation loop (Thr-Xaa-Tyr) close to the ATP and substrate binding site. In turn, p38 phosphorylates and activates the serine-threonine protein kinases MAPKAP kinase-2, MAPKAP kinase-3, MAPKAP kinase-5, MNK-1 and MSK-1. It has been established that activation of p38 regulates cytokine biosynthesis in many cell types either directly by phosphorylating and activating transcription factors invpjved in the expression of cytokines or indirectly, e.g. by phosphorylating MSK-1 which, when activated, activates the transcription factor CREB. It has also been shown that certain pyridinyl imidazoles, e.g. SB203580, which inhibit p38, inhibit the production of IL-lß and TNF-à from LPS-treated human monocytes. It has therefore been concluded that p38 constitutes a potentially highly interesting target for the development of anti-inflammatory compounds (cf. JC Lee et al., Immunopharmacology 47, 2000, pp. 185-201 and references reviewed therein; PR Young, "Specific Inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase" in Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle<br>

There are several reports on p38 MAP kinase and inflammatory cytokines in relation to cell growth and apoptosis, such as tumor proliferation and metastasis. Though the -exact mechanism of p38 MAP kinase mediated cell growth regulation Is not known, it Is believed that p38MAP kinase constitutes a potentially highly interesting target for the development of anti cancer drugs (S Nakada et al., Anticancer Research 21(1A), 2001, pp.167-171 and references cited therein; C Denkert et al., Cancer Letters 195(1), 2003 p.p. 101-109 and references cited therein).<br>
Compounds of formula I may comprise asymmetrically substituted (chiral) carbon atoms and carbon-carbon double bonds which may give .-rise to the existence or isomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers, diastereomers and geometric isomers. The present invention relates to all such isomers, either in pure former as mixtures thereof. Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and the intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of procedures known in the art. Diastereomers may be separated by physical separation methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e. g. liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phases. Enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereoisomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereoisomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs<br>
stereoselectively or stereospecifically, preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired<br>
said compound will be synthesized by stereoselective or stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ chiral pure starting materials. Likewise, pure geometric isomers may be obtained from the corresponding pure geometric isomers of the appropriate starting materials. A mixture of geometric isomers will typically exhibit different physical properties, and they may thus be separated by standard chromatographic techniques well-known in the art.<br>

Methods of preparation<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesised using the methods outlined below, together with methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereof as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below.<br>
The compounds of formula to may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. Ti   eactions are performed in solvents that are appropriate with respect to the reagents and materials employed and that are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also, in the synthetic methods described below, it is to. be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of experiment and work-up procedures, are chosen to be conditions of standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognised by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis, that the functionality present on various positions of the molecules used as the starting compounds or intermediates in the syntheses, must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Not all compounds 6f formula I falling into a given class may be compatible with some of the reaction conditions required in some of the methods described. Such restrictions of substituents or functional groups which are<br>
compatible with the reaction -conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternative methods can be used.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be prepared by a process comprising coupling of an amine of formula III with a triflate or halide, such as a bromide, iodide, fluoride, chloride, of formula II, as shown in Scheme 1; or alternatively by a process comprising coupling of an amine of formula Ila with a triflate or halide, such as a bromide or iodide, of formula Ilia, as shown in Scheme 1; where<br>
R1, R2' R3' R4' R5 and R6 are as defined above; except that any substituents or functional groups which are potentially reactive in the coupling reaction may be protected before the coupling reaction is performed, and the protective groups removed subsequently.<br><br>

The coupling reaction is carried out by using a method for the formation of diphenylamines well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The preferred method is the palladium catalysed amination method which comprises coupling of an amine with an arylhalogenide (or aryltriflate) in the presence of a base, a suitable Pd source, and a suitable phospNne ligand in an inert solvent.<br>
Different palladium compou    s may be used in the process, non-limiting examples of which are palladium(II) acetate, palladium(II) chloride, palladium(II) bromide, dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0). The preferred phosphine ligands include, but are not limited to, racemic or non-racemic 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,l'-binaphthyl (hereinafter refered to as BINAP), tri-o-tolylphosphine, tfi-tert-butylphosphine, 1,1' bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene, bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)£henyl]ether (DPEphos), 2-dicyclohexylphosphanyl-2'-dimethylaminobiphenyl, 2-(di-tert-butylphosphino)biphenyl and 9,9-dimethyl-4,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (Xantphos). The amount of palladium and ligand used in this catalytic process may be typically in the range 0.1 to 10 % by mole relative to the amount of the aromatic halide (or triflate) used. Especially sodium-tert-butoxide (NaOt-Bu) and caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) have proven to be the preferred bases in this process, but other bases may<br>
be used as well. The reaction is typically performed at elevated temperatures (80-120<br>
°C) in inert solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, toluene, benzene, and tetrahydrofuran under an inert atmosphere, e.g. argon or nitrogen.<br>
When R74is an electron withdrawing group (EWG; sucn as nitro or cyano the above coupling may also be performed non-catalytically in the presence of strong bases like potassium- or sodium-tert-butoxide. The reaction is typically performed at room<br>
temperature or higher (20-200 °C) in aprotic solvents like dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) under an inert atmosphere, e.g. argon or nitrogen.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention of the general formula III may be prepared by several methods known to those' skilled in the art-of organic synthesis. One useful sequence is shown in Scheme 2. The key step comprises the coupling of a halide, preferably an iodide or bromide of general formula VI with an acid chloride of general formula V to afford a benzophenone of general formula IV. The benzophenone IV may then be reduced to the corresponding amine of general formula III by treatment with<br>
standard reducing agents. Examples of such reducing agents include, but are not limited to, stannous chloride dihydrate, hydrogen, ammonium formiate or hydrazine hydrate and a catalytic amount of palladium on carbon. The coupling reaction may be achieved by transforming the halide (VI) into a reactive organometallic intermediate, such as by treatment with /so-propyl magnesium chloride to afford the corresponding magnesium derivative, or by treatment with n-butyllithium to afford the corresponding lithium derivative.<br>

Scheme 2<br>
The reactivity of this organometallic intermediate is then modulated by transmetalation to e.g. zinc, by treatment with ZnCI2, ZnBr2, or ZnI2. This organozinc compound is then coupled with the acid halide, such as an acid chloride of general formula V, in the<br>
presence or mediated by a catalytic amount of a palladium(O) complex. Examples of such palladium catalysts include but are not limited to<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), tetrakis(triphenylarsine)palladium(0), d!chlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladiurn(II), or<br>
benzylchlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II). Alternatively, the organozinc compound is coupled with the acid halide, such as the acid chloride, of general formula V, in the presence or mediated by an equimolar or substoichiometric or catalytic amount (with regard to V), such as 0.1- 99 mol%, e.g. 0.5-10 mol%, e.g. 1-5 mol°/o,<br>
e.g. 2-3 mol% of copper (I) or (II) salts, such as copper(II)acetate or the soluble complex CuCN-ZLICI or CuCIM-2LiBr. The coupling reaction is typically performed at room temperature In inert solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, toluene, benzene, and tetrahydrofuran under an inert atmospnere, e.g. argon or nitrogen.<br>

FGI: Functional group interconversion<br>

Scheme 3<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may in special cases be prepared by a simple functional group interconversion (FGI), meaning a standard process, known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis, where a functional1 group, in compounds with the general formula I or I' is transformed into a different functional group in one or more synthetic steps, leading to a new compound with the general formula I. Examples of such processes include, but are not limited to, hydrolysis of an ester to give an acid<br>
under basic conditions, deprotection of a methylether to give a phenol by treatment with e.g. borontribromide (BBrs), and catalytic hydrogenation of an olefin to give a<br>
saturated hydrocarbon. Non limiting examples of such transformations are described in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations", by R. C. Larock, VCH 1989, which is hereby incorporated as reference and in general procedures. Especially, the use of general protective groups in one or more synthetic steps may be convenient in the synthesis of compounds with the general formula I. Examples of such general protective groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl or benzyl esters as protective groups of an hydroxy group; tetrahydropyranyl- or silyl-ethers as protective groups of an hydroxy group.<br>
As shown in Scheme 2 and 3 each intermediate compound may be transformed oy an FGI process as described above to give new compounds witlithe same general formula (e.g. an hydroxy group may be protected as an tert-butyl-dimethyl-silyl ether). This is only to illustrate the flexibility in the synthesis, and in general the described sequence of processes is only one of many possible strategies for the synthesis of compounds of the present Invention. That is, it may be more advantageous in some cases to alter the sequence of the processes described above. The described sequence of processes is not considered as being limiting the preparation of compounds of the present invention of general formula I, and alteration of the reaction sequence may be an obvious alternative for those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. This aspect of the invention may especially be advantageous in the synthesis of compounds with different substltuents In the R4, R5, and R6 groups. Readily available Intermediates may serve as<br>
Starting point for tne syntnesis of variousi series of compounds-covered by the general formula I.<br>

Pharmacological methods<br>
To study the effect of compounds of the present invention in-vitro the inhibition of IL-<br>
lp and TNF-α secretion was determined using the following procedure:<br>
Cytokine production was measured in the media from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mononuclear cells were Isolated from human peripheral blood by Lymphoprep® (Nycomed, Norway) fractionation and suspended in RPMI1640'(growth medium) with foetal calf serum (PCS, 2%), at a<br>
concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml. The cells were incubated in 24-well tissue culture plates in 1 ml aliquots. Test compounds were dissolved In dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 10 mM) and were diluted with the medium. Compounds were added to the cells for 30 minutes, then LPS (1 mg/ml final concentration) was added. The. plates were incubated for 18 hours, and the concentration of IL-1ß and TNF-α in the medium was determined<br>
by enzyme-linked of the compounds Table 1.<br>
immunosorbent assays. The median inhibitory concentrations were calculated. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

p 38α MAP klnase assay Cell culture<br>
COS-1 cells (derived from African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell containing wild-type T antigen under control of the SV40 promotor) were obtained from ATCC (ATCC no. CRL-1650) and grown in growth medium (DMEM without phenolred, 10% PCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100U penicillin and 100 ng streptomycin/ml) at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cells were passaged twice a week by trypsination (0.25% trypsin, 1 mM EDTA in PBS) and were split 1:10. The medium was changed every second or third day. The cell line was regularly tested with the Mycoplasma PCR Primer Set (Stratagene) and  found to be free of Mycoplasma. Tissue culture media,.PCS, L-glutamlne and penlcilin and streptomycin are from Bribco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.<br>

The plasmids were introduced into the COS-1 cells in serum-free medium using DOTAP™ (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Plasmid DNA was prepared and purified using the QIAGEN EndoToxin-free Maxiprep-500 kit (rtilden,'Germany). Briefly, DNA and DOTAP™ were mixed for exactly 15 min. at 37°C in the CO2 incubator. The transfection-mixture was hereafter transferred to a 15-ml falcon-tube and transfection-medium (DMEM with L-Glutamine and Pen./Strep. but without serum) was added to the<br>
transfection-mixture, followed" by addition to the cell-monolayer. After 4 hours of incubation with DOTAP™ and plasmids, the medium containing double amount of serum was added to the cells bringing the final concentration of serum up to 10%. The cells were then incubated for 24 hours before kinase reaction.<br>
Immunoprecipitation<br>
After 24 hrs of incubation the reaction was stopped by putting the petri dish on an ice-bath. The medium was aspirated, and the cell monolayer was hashed once in ice-cold PBS (137 mM NaCI, 1.5 mM KH2PO.,, 2.7 mM KCI, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4-2H2O), and hereafter solubilised for 10 min. in 1.5 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 100 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, l% Triton-X-100,<br>
Pefabloc 500 µM, Leupeptin 10 µg/µl, Aprotinin l0 µg/µl) was added.The cell<br>
monolayer was scraped by a rubber-policeman, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube.<br>
The solubilised cells were clarified by centrifugation at 10.000xg for 10 min. at 4°C. The<br>
supernatant was transferred to 50 µ1 prewashed Protein G Sepharose beads in HNT-buffer (30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mM NaCI, 0.1% Triton X-100) and were incubated with 2 ng/sample of monoclonal anti-FLAG™ M2 antibody (raised against the FLAG-epitope, NH2-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-COOH) for 1 hour at room temperature. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma (cat. no. F-3165). Approx. 60 µg protein of clarified cell lysate were added to the preadsorbed anti-FLAG™ antibodies on Protein G Sepharose beads and incubated for 90 min. at 4°C in a blood sample mixer, After the immunoprecipitation period the Sepharose beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in a kinase reaction buffer -(25-mM-HEPE-S-pH-7-.5r10mM magnesium acetate, 50µM ATP)..<br>
Incubation of the compounds with purified p38α kinase<br>
The pre-washed immunoprecipitated anti-FLAG-p38 adsorbed on Protein G Sepharose beads was washed twice in Ixkinase-buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50µM ATP), and the supernatant was aspirated. The compounds were diluted in lx kinase buffer at the appropriate concentration. The compounds were added to the washed immunoprecipitated and activated FLAG-p38 adsorbed on the Protein G Sepharose beads for 30 min. at 30°C in a volume of 100 µl. Every 10 min. the Eppendorf tubes were tapped to ensure that the beads and the compounds were in the solution. After 30 min. incubation, the beads were spun down and the supernatant was aspirated.<br>
p38α MAP Kinase Reaction<br>
The kinase reaction was started by adding 1 µg GST-ATF-2 substrate (Santa Cruz, LaJolla, CA, USA, cat. no. sc-4114) together with 2 µCi γ-32P-ATP in lx kinase-buffer per sample. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. at 30°C, and it was    -stopped by adding 40 µl of 2xSDS-sample buffer to the kinase reaction. The samples were boiled, spinned down, and resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE. The dried SDS-PAGE gel was exposed to a Phospho-Imager screen and the radioactive PHAS-1 bands were quantified by the STORM860 Phospho-Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA,<br>
USA) using the ImageQuaNT software.<br>
In this assay, Compound 112 was found to be a potent p38 MAP kinase inhibitor with an IC50 of 2 nM.<br>
In vivo screening model of LPS induced TNF-α response in  mice    To study the effect of compounds of the present invention In vivo, an in vivo screening model of LPS induced TNF-a response in mice was set up as follows: Groups of 6 mice (C3H/HeN, female, about 8 weeks (20 g), Bomholtgaard) were dosed with test compounds in suspension vehicle 1 hour prior to LPS administration (LPS from E. coll 055:B5, L-4005, Sigma). At time 0, the mice were dosed ip with 1.0 mg LPS/kg. After anesthetization with Hypnorm/Dormicum, the mice were bled from the periorbital venous plexus 80-90 minutes after LPS administration. The blood samples were sampled in EDTA stabilised tubes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. The plasma level of TNF-a was analysed by ELISA. Compound 156 of WO 98/32730 was used as reference compound. The plasma level of TNF-a was determined using a sandwich ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with a monoclonal antibody against" mouse TNF-α, washed and blocked with a casein buffer. Samples of mouse TNF-α recombinant standards were added to the wells of the microtiter plates and incubated.<br>
All standards were tested in triplicate, all plasma samples in single. After sample and<br>
standard incubation, the plates were washed and incubated with biotinylated polyclonal<br>
secondary antibody against mouse TNF-a and washed.. Enzyme conjugate was added to all wells and incubated. Substrate was added and the enzyme/substrate reaction stopped after 15 minutes at room temperature with 1M H2S04. The colour development (OD) was measured at 450 nm on an ELISA reader and the background OD at 620 nm was subtracted. Experiments were approved if the group treated with the reference compound showed a significant inhibition (p
tested at 10 mg/kg. The Marm'-Whitney test was used to compare drug treated groups to the IPS treated control group (p
