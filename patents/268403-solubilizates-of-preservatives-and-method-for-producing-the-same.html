				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a solubilizate of a preserving agent.<br>
In the German Patent Application Publication 26 23 682, a procedure for manufacturing a suspension and an emulsion from sorbic acid is described, in which a heated solution of sorbic acid is atomized in a solvent made from water, mixed with a water-soluble, organic solvent having a low boiling point; the resulting fluid is then cooled quickly and the excess solvent is removed. Because of the warming and atomization of the sorbic acid solution, this procedure is very complex.<br>
In the document DE 25 19 557, a disinfecting soap is described, which, besides the disinfectant and a non-ionic emulsifier, such as a polysorbate for example, contains a considerable amount of diluent as well as other additional substances as galenicals. This soap disinfects hands or 'other skin areas in the medical field.<br>
The document DE 601 03 023 T2 discloses acidic anti-microbial compositions for the treatment of foodstuffs, which comprise an organic acid, a likewise non-ionic surfactant and a stabilizing agent, for example a polysorbate. With considerable dilution, the mixture can be used for treating the surfaces of foodstuffs in order to reduce the microbial population settling on these surfaces.<br>
For the preservation of foodstuffs against microbial rotting, there is, in addition to the biological and chemical acidification as well as the heating process, the chemical preservation with bactericidal or bacteriostatic chemicals.<br><br>
The most common preservatives for beverages are sorbic acid (E200 and salts E201-3) and benzoic acid (E201 and salts 211-13).<br>
Benzoic acid (BS) acts mainly against yeast and molds; bacteria are only partially inhibited. Sorbic acid (SS) acts likewise against yeasts and molds, but somewhat better also against bacteria, primarily against catalase-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In practice, a mixed preservative of equal parts benzoic acid and sorbic acid proved to have a certain synergetic effect. It is also possible to reduce in this way the adverse effect on the taste of the foodstuff caused by high amounts of preservatives. Usual amounts are 150-200 ppm per preservative in the finished product. The maximum amounts for non-alcoholic drinks are limited to 300 ppm SS or 150 ppm BS; when mixed the maximum amounts are 250 ppm SS + 150 ppm BS.<br>
These preservatives are used for beverages and other fluid foodstuffs containing large amounts of water, generally in the form of their water-soluble sodium, calcium and potassium salts. The bactericidal effect, however, is developed exclusively by the undissociated acids. If the foodstuffs to be preserved with benzoic acid and/or sorbic acid contain ascorbic acid, then there exists the danger that, through a reaction of the ascorbic acid with the benzoic acid and/or the sorbic acid, undesired, because health hazardous, reaction products such as benzene, could result.<br>
The solubilities of the preservatives mentioned in water, ethanol and oil are:<br><br><br>
The dissociation of the weak acid SS (pKs = 4.8) and BS (pKs = 4.22) is highly dependent on the pH-value of the medium, in which they are used. For pH-values, as they are common for classic non-alcoholic drinks (pH = 2.8-3.5), 90-100% of SS or BS is undissociated and thereby effective as bactericide. However, due to the poor water-solubility of the acids, a relatively high dose is necessary.<br>
In products with low acidity, on the other hand, (pH-values 4.0-neutral), primarily for BS, considerable portions are dissociated that have no effect against microorganisms.<br><br>
The invention therefore has the object to better protect foodstuffs, primarily beverages, against the effects of microorganisms.<br>
In order to do so, the invention suggests a solubilizate of a preservative that is free of a stabilizing agent, which contains an aliphatic and/or aromatic acid such as sorbic acid and/or benzoic acid as well a one or more emulsifiers with a HLB value<br><br>
between 9 and 18. The concentration of emulsifier can lie between 50% and 95% with respect to the total amount of the solubilizate. The sorbic or benzoic acid or the mixture of the two can be contained in the solubilizate in an amount between 5% and 50%. It is advisable to use a polysorbate as the emulsifier, preferably polysorbate 20 and/or polysorbate 80.<br>
The solubilizate according to the invention has an excellent bactericidal effect. For example, if, on the one hand 500 mg potassium sorbate and on the other hand in comparison 500 mg sorbic acid-solubilizate with polysorbate 20, are given to an agar nutrient solution, after about three weeks contact time with potassium sorbate there results a bacteria count of 1.6 x 1010, compared to a bacteria count of 3.5 x lO8 with a sorbic acid-solubilizate, in other words a bacteria count smaller by almost two orders of magnitude.<br>
The invention is based on the concept of slowing or preventing a dissociation of the organic aids primarily in media that are only weakly acidic through micellation, with the consequence that more undissociated acid is available for the elimination of microorganisms. Therefore, the dose of the micellated organic acids can be lowered considerably. Since the micelles only open upon contact with cell membranes or similar biological material, the acid released from the micelles can act directly on the microorganisms to eliminate them.<br>
The invention can be used for foodstuffs of all kinds, in particular in non-alcoholic beverages with high pH values from about 4.0 to 7.0, such as tea, coffee, cocoa and milk beverages. The preservative solubilizates are added to the relevant tea,<br><br>
coffee, cocoa and milk drinks. The dosing occurs individually by the producer of the end product between 100 ppm and 500 ppm, which means, assuming a twenty percent benzoic acid solubilizate between 500 ppm and 1000 ppm per liter of end product.<br>
The invention can furthermore be used for the preservation of milk products such as milk, cheese and yogurt. The solubilizates are applied primarily to the cheese rind. The sorbic acid solubilizate may also be used in small amounts in cheese. Moreover, vegetables, fruits and herbs can be submerged in an aqueous solution of the solubilizate according to the invention and thereby be better protected against mold, fungi and yeasts and also made longer-lasting. Finally, the invention also allows for the preservation of surfaces of wood or other artificial materials, so that, for example, furniture or the surfaces of medical apparatus and devices can be treated for preservation with solubilizates in diluted watery solution.<br>
The bactericidal effect of a benzoic acid solubilizate, for example, is demonstrated by an investigation of a publically ordered and sworn expert for foodstuff chemistry.<br>

The composition of the 20% solution of benzoic acid solubilizate according to 2) is given in the following examples under EW0108/8.<br>
The following table 1 shows the influence of benzoic acid on the yeast growth and table 2 gives the inhibition of the yeast growth achieved, each at pH 6.2 and room temperature. Table 1 shows that even with a benzoic acid concentration of 500 ppm, there is still a high yeast growth after 29 days of contact time. In comparison, Table 2 shows that with a benzoic acid concentration of 500 ppm in solubilizate, the yeast growth is considerably slowed down starting right at the beginning of the addition of the solubilizate, and that after 29 days of contact time the yeast is completely eliminated. Even after the third day of contact, a benzoic acid concentration in solubilizate of 300 ppm leads to a continuous growth reduction of the yeast.<br>
Preferred forms of implementation of the invented solubilizate are given in the subclaims. It is recommended when the sorbic acid solubilizate exhibits about 5% by weight sorbic acid and 95% by weight polysorbate 20. For the benzoic acid, a solubilizate that contains about 20% by weight benzoic acid and about 80% by weight polysorbate 20 is advisable. Furthermore, it is advisable for many applications, for example for an addition to acidified beverages, if the benzoic acid solubilizate contains a portion of a wetting agent, which binds the micellated benzoic acid to such a degree that free benzoic acid is practically non-existent in<br><br>
the beverage. If the beverage is, for instance, mixed with ascorbic acid, then the effect of the ascorbic acid on the benzoic acid can easily cause the formation of benzoene which is damaging for foodstuffs. The benzoic acid solubilizate according to the present invention prevents the formation of benzoene in acidified beverages. The wetting agent advisably includes a mixture of an oil containing primarily middle-chain triglycerides with a small portion of wax, Cera alba, for example.<br>
The wetting agent can be represented in the benzoic acid solubilizate with a concentration of about 2% by weight to 10% by weight, whereby about 3% by weight to 10% by weight could fall upon the oil and about 1% by weight to about 2% by weight could fall upon the wax.<br>
In detail, a benzoic solubilizate proves to be especially favorable in its bactericidal effect, when it contains about 21% by weight benzoic acid, about 5% by weight of a primarily middle-chain triglyceride oil, about 73% by weight polysorbate 20 and about 1% by weight of a wax, such as beeswax (Cera alba). Instead of polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80 can be used in about the same amount in the benzoic acid solubilizate. Finally, a solubilizate comes into consideration, which consists of about 5% by weight sorbic acid, about 5% by weight benzoic acid about 90% by weight polysorbate 20.<br><br><br><br>
Subsequently, without limiting the generality of the patent claims, five special formulations will be given, which also contain information about the corresponding method of production of the individual solubilizates. In the simplest form of the manufacturing process, this is designed so that the emulsifier is warmed to about 70°C up to about 90°C, in the case of the polysorbate 20 to about 72°C up to about 85°C, preferably warmed to about 80°C up to about 85°C, the aliphatic and/or the aromatic acid is slowly, that means without considerable (max. 5°C) cooling of the emulsifier, while being stirred, incorporated in the warm emulsifier, after complete mixing, the mixture is further warmed to about 83°C up to about 90°C, while being constantly stirred, and is well homogenized. Then the solubilizate is allowed to cool for bottling to under 35°C, whereby it is recommended that the mixture be cooled quickly to 40°C. It is advisable to introduce an emulsifier of about 50 % by weight to about 95 % by weight, such as polysorbate 20 and/or polysorbate 80, into the production procedure. For the aliphatic and/or aromatic acid it is recommended that about 5% by weight to about 50% by weight be used.<br>
If the benzoic acid solubilizate contains a wetting agent, one should proceed so that, first, the wetting agent is warmed to about 55°C up to about 65°C, preferably 58°C up to about 62°C, and homogenized, that the benzoic acid is added to the warm wetting agent and homogenized again while being stirred, that then about one fifth of the polysorbate amount, so about 150 g per kg solubilizate, is added to the benzoic acid / wetting agent mixture and the mass thereby obtained is warmed while being stirred to about 80°C up to about 90°C and homogenized and that, then, the rest of the polysorbate, so four fifths of it, is added slowly, stirred well and the temperature is held at about 80°C to 90°C for at least 5<br><br><br>
minutes. Then if necessary, it can be cooled quickly to 40°C and bottled at about 35°C. In this procedure about 2% by weight to about 10% by weight wetting agent can be used. If in the preferred design of the procedure, a mixture of an oil containing predominantly middle-chain triglyceride and a wax is used as wetting agent, it is advisable to incorporate about 1% to 1.5% by weight of the wax in about 5% by weight of the oil warmed as described, and to homogenize the mixture and finally add about 20% by weight benzoic acid and then add, as described above, the polysorbate. Otherwise, the preferred methods for the procedure according to the present invention are given in the procedure claims.<br>
For the solubilizate according to the present invention, the radius distributions of the micelles formed have been measured. The result is shown in the attached figures 1 and 2. The measurements were conducted according to the field-flow method of the Wyatt Technologie Europe GmbH. Figure 1 refers to the 5% sorbic acid solubilizate and figure 2 applies for the 20% benzoic acid solubilizate. Recognizable is that the middle micelle radius for the sorbic acid solubilizate lies under 10 nm and the middle micelle radius for the benzoic acid solubilizate lies under 20 nm.<br>
In the formulations MCT means medium chain triglyceride. The weight information in percent refer to the total weight of the solubilizate = 100% by weight.<br>
