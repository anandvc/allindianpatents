PHOSPHINIC ACID ANALOGS  OF GLUTAMATE<br>
This invention is concerned with compounds useful for the prevention or suppression of human malodour, in particular human axillary malodour.<br>
It is known that fresh sweat is odourless and that odour is only formed upon contact of sweat with skin bacteria (for example bacteria of the genera of Staphylococcus and Coiynebacteria) and it is believed that odourless molecules present in sweat are degraded by bacteria colonising the axilla. It is generally accepted (Labows et. al, Cosmet. Sci Technol. Ser. (1999), 20:59-82) that highly unpleasant malodour is released from fresh sweat mainly by the Coiynebacteria genus of bacteria. The principal constituents thought to be responsible for malodour include volatile steroids, volatile sulphur compounds and short-chain, branched fatty acids.<br>
It has been suggested to treat malodour by eradicating the bacteria responsible for causing the odour. Indeed, commercially available cosmetic deodorants often contain antibacterial compounds that generally inhibit the growth of skin microflora. Antibacterial compounds currently used in deodorant products include, for example Triclosan (2,4,4^trichloro-25hydroxy-diphenyl-ether). However, a draw-back to the use of antibacterials is the potential for disturbing the equilibrium of the skin's natural microflora.<br>
Fatty acids, in particular short chain, branched fatty acids are known to play a role in axillary malodour, and are particularly foul smelling components of stale sweat. In copending application PCT/CH02/00262 the applicant has disclosed an enzyme that mediates in a process of transforming odourless compounds found in sweat into these malodorous fatty acids. In this co-pending application there is also disclosed a broad class of compounds having activity as inhibitors of the enzyme.<br>
Nevertheless there remains the need to find further compounds displaying good inhibitory properties with respect to the above mentioned enzyme.<br><br><br><br>
zb)	hexyl;<br>
zc)	trans-4-isopropyl-cyclohexyk<br>
zd)	5-ethyl~2-methyl-heptyl;<br>
ze)	2,6, 10-trimeth)rl-undecyi;<br>
zf)	1 -methyl-3-(2J2,3-trimethyl-cyclopentyl)-propyl; and<br>
zg)	octyl.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) contain chiral atoms and as such they can exist as isomeric mixtures or they may exist as pure stereoisomers. Most preferred are compounds have an S-configuration on the carbon atom in the position alpha to the carboxyl group.<br>
As stated hereinabove, compounds of the present invention may interact with an enzyme thereby to reduce the enzyme's ability to cleave compounds in sweat leading to release of malodorous acids from odourless fresh sweat. That enzyme, described in the afore-mentioned co-pending application, was isolated from the bacteria of the genus Coiynebacteria that can be found colonising the axilla, in particular certain Corynebacteria sp., more particularly Corynebacteriitm striatum Ax 20 which has been submitted on the 26, April 2001 to the International Depository Authority DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikrooganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, D-38124 Braunschweig. The Accession Number provided by the International Depository Authority is DSM 14267. The enzyme was found to occur intracellularly and can be released from the cells by mechanical disruption of the cell envelope. Thus, it may be isolated from cellular extracts obtained from wild-type bacterial strains, especially from strains of Corynebacteria isolated from the human axilla, in particular Corynebacterium . striatum Ax 20. In the alternative, it may be produced by recombinant means which are well known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
The amino acid sequence of this enzyme is set forth in SEQ ID No. 1 and a nucleic acid sequence encoding for this enzyme is set forth in SEQ ID No. 2, both of which sequences are shown below.<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention display inhibition of the enzyme at concentrations of about 1 to 500,nanomolar more particularly from 5 nanomolar 500 nanomolar concentration in vitro, e.g. from 9 to 150 nanomolar. Furthermore, having regard to the lipophilicity of the residue R, the compounds are adapted to penetrate the cell walls of the enzyme-producing bacteria, as such, they are efficaceous in vivo.<br>
Indeed, the nature of the residue R appears to influence the ability of compounds to penetrate the cellular walls of different bacteria colonising the axilla and which are implicated in malodour production. For example, other strains of' Corynebacteria, for example Corynebacterium bovis zxi&amp;Corynebacteriamjeikeium , or bacteria of the genus Staphylococci found in the microflora of the axilla also produce related enzymes that themselves mediate in biochemical reactions wherein L-glutamine derivatives are cleaved at Na- The compounds of the present invention may interfere in cellular processes of a wide variety of bacterial strains thereby resulting in the suppression or prevention of malodour from these sources.<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds as inhibitors may be measured in terms of either their ICso values or their Ki values, both of which measures are well known to the person skilled in the art. As is well known, the ICso value provides the concentration of an inhibitor needed to reduce enzyme velocity by half at a given substrate concentration. This value is dependent on the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme which is reflected in the value Km of the substrate. In this way, the Ki value may be determined for a given substrate and a given substrate concentration by measuring ICso and then calculating according to the following formula<br><br>
The uptake of the compounds in bacterial cells and the inhibition of the enzyme contained therein may be measured using an assay based on stationary-phase living cells. Thus, cells may be incubated along with inhibitory compound or compounds, and<br><br>
the substrate (i.e. the material found in sweat, which when cleaved by the enzyme forms the malodorous acids), and the release of acids may be measured at various inhibitor concentrations. By comparing IC50 values obtained"with the living cells with the JCso values obtained with the isolated enzyme, the ease of penetration of the compounds into the bacterial cells can be assessed.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be added to any cosmetic and personal care products such as sticks, roll-ons, pump-sprays, aerosols, deodorant soaps, powders, solutions, gels, creams, sticks, balms and lotions to enhance the deodorising effect of these products. Preferably, a compound of the present invention may be employed in said products in amounts of about 0.01 to 0.5% by weight.<br>
The above-mentioned products, in addition to the inhibitors, may comprise antibacterial agents known in the art, e.g. Triclosan. The products may also comprise dermatologically acceptable ingredients such as are commonly used in these types of product. Examples of such additional ingredients include fragrances, colorants, opacifiers, buffers, antioxidants, vitamins, emulsifiers, UV absorbers, silicones and the like. As is also well known, all products can be buffered to the desired pH.<br>
In addition to the inhibitor, a deodorant cologne may comprise ethanol and fragrance. Fragrance may be present from 1 to 10% and the ethanol can be present to make up the mass to 100%.<br>
Additional ingredients in a typical ethanol-free deodorant stick may include polyols, such as propylene glycol; derivatives thereof, such as propylene-glycol-3-myristyl ether (Witconol APM); water; a surfactant such as sodium stearate; and fragrance. The polyol may be present in an amount of 30 to 40%; the derivatives of the polyol likewise may be present at about 30 to 40%; water may be present to about 10 to 20%; the surfactant may be present to 5 to 10%; and the fragrance may be present in an amount up to 10%.<br>
A typical antiperspirant stick might contain as additional ingredients such as Ethylene Glycol Monostearate (e.g. from 5 to 10%); Shea butter (e.g. from 3 to 5%); Neobee<br><br>
1053 (PVO International) (e.g. froma bout 12 to 15%); General 122 (Henkel) (e.g. from about 3 to 7%); Dimethicone (DC 345)(e.g. from 30 to 40%); aluminium sesquichlorohydrate (e.g. from about 15 to 20%); and a fragrance, e.g. from 1 to 10%.<br>
An antiperspirant aerosol may contain ethanol, e.g. from about 10 to 15%; zirconium aluminium tetrachlorohydrate, e.g. from about 3 to 5%; Bentone 38, e.g. from about 1 to 2%; fragrance in an amount aforementioned; and a hydrocarbon propellant, e.g. S-31, up to 100% based on the total aerosol composition.<br>
An antiperspirant pump composition may contain aluminium sesquichlorohydrate, e.g. from 15 to 25%; water, e.g. from 50 to 60%; Triton X-102 (Union carbide), e.g. from 1 to 3%; dimethyl Isosorbide (ICI), e.g. from 15 to 25 %; and a fragrance in an amount as aforementioned.<br>
All percentages mentioned above are in wt %.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I) and/or compositions containing same for the elimination or suppression of malodour. The invention also relates to compositions comprising an odour-suppressing quantity of an inhibitor compound, which acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme, and dermatologically acceptable vehicles that are generally well known in the art of cosmetic and personal care products.<br>
The invention also provides in another of its aspects, a method of suppressing axillary malodour comprising the step of providing a composition for application to the skin of a person in need of treatment, said composition containing an inhibitor compound and dermatologically acceptable vehicle therefor, said compound being selected from one or more compounds of formula (I) described above.<br>

StepD: 288 g (0.4 mol) of the P-geranyl phosphinoyl compound 4n (prepared according to Example IB) is dissolved in 1.4L ethanol at 70°C. 58 g of platinum (2.5% on charcoal / H2O 1:1) is added at room temperature and the mixture is stirred under hydrogen for several days until complete hydrogenation (of the 2 double bonds) is detected by lH-NMR or MS / ESI. The mixture is filtered over Celite which is washed with 0.3L ethanol.<br>
Step E: 2L LiOH (IN in H2O) are added to the filtrate.^Under stirring the solution is   * heated to 50°C for 1-2 days until complete hydrolysis is detected by *H-NMR or MS / ESI. The solution is neutralized by addition of ca. 250 ml cone. HC1. The supernatant solution is decanted from the precipitates, the ethanol is removed from this solution<br><br>
under reduced pressure and the remaining H2O phase is extracted with 3 x 0.5L CH2CI2. The above precipitates are dissolved in 1.5L CH2CI2. The combined organic layers are dried over MgSC&gt;4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 206 g of a reddish solid.<br>
Step F: The resulting material of Step E (ca. 0.35 mol) is dissolved in 2.5L trifluoroacetic acid. 120 g (0.75 mol) triisopropylsilane is added and the resulting suspension stirred for 4 h at room temperature. The trifluoroacetic acid is removed under reduced pressure. 3L H2O is added to the residue und the resulting suspension stirred at 60°C for 15 min. The supernatant water-phase is decanted off. 3L NH3 (6% in water) is added to the residue, the resulting suspension is stirred at 60°C for 15 min and filtered over Celite. The filtrate is divided into 3 portions and filtered over 3 Chromabond C18-columns filled each with 10 g RP (Reverse Phase) material. The filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure. To the residues toluene is added and removed under reduced pressure (3 times). Drying under high vacuum gives 109 g of a white-yellow solid foam.<br>

Whereas this synthesis is described with reference to the "R" residue relating to compound 5n (above), this synthesis is carried out for the preparation of other phosphinoyl compounds whose "R" residues correspond to the compounds 5zc, 5zd, 5ze and 5zf which are derived from P-alkyl-, and P-y/y-disubstituted allyl-phosphinoyl compounds 4zc, 4zd, 4ze, and 4zf which are prone to oxaphospholane formation under acidic conditions. Therefore the corresponding 0=C-double bonds were removed by hydrogenation, prior to hydrolysis / detritylation.<br><br>
All other phosphinoyl compounds (5a - 5m, 5o to 5zb and 5zg) were prepared without prior hydrogenation (Step D) just by hydrolysis / detritylation (Steps E and F). Compound 5zc was also prepared following the general procedure of Example 2 except that the hydrogenation was carried out over Raney-Nickel in place of platinum on charcoal (Step D).<br>

Example 8: Measuring inhibitory activity<br>
Cellular Extracts of Corynebacterium striatum Ax 20 (DSM 14267) are prepared by mechanical disruption and subsequent centrifiigation.<br>
The extract (50 jil ml corresponding to 0.2 ml initial cell culture) is added to 50 JJLI of Buffer A (Phosphate Buffer, pH 7). Various concentrations of the compounds of the present invention are added in a volume of 40 pi, and after 10 min preincubation at 37°C, the reaction is and amended with 10 p.1 of substrate (Na-lauroyl-L-glutamine, final concentration 50 pM). The samples are incubated for 15 min and then the reaction is stopped by adding 75 JLXI of Fluorescamine (2.5 mM dissolved in Acetonitrile). The fluorescence resulting from derivatization of the released glutamine with fluorescamine is determined at an excitation wavelength of 381 nm and an emission wavelength of 470 nm. By comparing the samples containing compounds of the present invention with control samples with enzyme and substrate only, the inhibition (%) is calculated. Alternatively, the same assay is made with a recombinantly formed enzyme produced with a strain containing an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence<br><br>
encoding for the enzyme. The results for some compounds of the present invention are<br>
listed in Table 1.<br><br>
In order to evaluate enzyme activity in intact cells, stationary phase living cells of Ax20 are harvested and resuspended in Buffer A to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.25. Inhibitory compounds are added at various concentrations, and after a preincubation of 15 min, the substrate (Na-lauroyl-L-glutamine, 1 raM final concentration) is added. The samples are incubated for 1 h and then extracted with MTBE and HC1 and analysed for released lauric acid using capillary GC. By comparing the samples containing compounds of the present invention with control samples with bacteria and substrate only, the inhibition (%) is calculated. By comparing the inhibitory capacity of the compounds on the isolated enzyme with the values obtained using intact cells, the relative uptake of the compounds by the cells can be assessed. From Table 2 it appears, that compounds of the present invention can cross the bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmatic membrane, and thus can have inhibitory activity in living cells.<br>
