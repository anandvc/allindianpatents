INFRASTRUCTURE<br>
FEELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to local area network (IAN) communications, and specifically to methods and devices for improving the performance of wireless LANs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wireless local area networks (WIANs) are gaining in popularity, and new wireless applications are being developed. The original WLAN standards, such as "Bluetooth" and IEEE S02.11, were designed to enable communications at 1-2 Mbps in a band around 2.4 GHz. More recently, IEEE working groups have defined the 802.1 la, 802.1 Ib and 802.1 Ig extensions to the original standard, in order to enable higher data rates. The 802.1 la standard, for example, envisions data rates up to 54 Mbps over short distances in a 5 GHz band, while 802.1 Ib defines data rates up to 22 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band. In the context of the present patent application and in the claims, the term "802.11" is used to refer collectively to the original IEEE 802.11 standard and all its variants and extensions, unless specifically noted otherwise.<br>
The theoretical capability of new WIAN technologies to offer enormous communication bandwidth to mobile users is severely hampered by the practical limitations of wireless communications. Indoor propagation of radio frequencies is not isotropic, because radio waves are influenced by building layout and furnishings. Therefore, even when wireless access points are carefully positioned throughout a building, some "black holes" generally remain - areas with little or no radio reception. Furthermore, 802.11 wireless links can operate at full speed only under conditions of high signal/noise ratio. Signal strength scales inversely with the distance of the mobile station from its access point, and therefore so does communication speed. A single mobile station with poor reception due to distance or radio propagation problems can slow down WLAN access for ail other users in its basic service set i.BSS - the group of mobile stations communicating with :he same access point).<br>
The natural response to these practical difficulties '.vould. be to distribute a greater number of access points within the area to be served. If a receiver receives signals simultaneously from two sources of similar strength on the same frequency channel, however, it is aenerailv unable to decipher either signal. The 302.II standard provides a mechanism for<br>
Collision avoidance based on clear channel assessment (CCA), which requires a station to refrain from transmitting when it senses other transmissions on its frequency channel. In practice, this mechanism is of limited utility and can place a heavy burden on different BSSs operating on the same frequency channel<br>
Therefore, in high data-rate 802.11 WLANs known hi the art, access points hi mutual proximity must use different frequency channels. Theoretically, the 802.lib and 802.llg standards define 14 frequency channels hi the 2.4 GHz band, but because of bandwidth and regulatory limitations, WLANs operating according to these standards in the United States actually have only three different frequency channels from which to choose. (In other countries, such as Spain, France and Japan, only one channel is available.) As a result, in complex, indoor environments, it becomes practically impossible to distribute wireless access points closely enough to give strong signals throughout the environment without substantial overlap hi the coverage areas of different access points operating on the same frequency channel.<br>
Access points in a WLAN system are typically interconnected by a wired LAN to communicate with a hub. The LAN serves as a distribution system (DS) for exchanging data between the access points and the hub. This arrangement enables the mobile stations to send and receive data through the access points to and from external networks, such as the Ihtemet, via an access line connected to the hub.<br>
Most commonly, the LAN used as a DS is an Ethernet LAN, operating in accordance with the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) method of media access control (MAC) defined hi IEEE Standard 802.3 (2000 Edition), which is incorporated herein by reference. The terms "Ethernet," "CSMA/CD" and "802.3" are used in the art interchangeably to refer to LANs of this type. Ethernet LANs are typically capable of carrying dara at high speeds - greater than the aggregate speed of wireless communications between the access points and mobile stations. For example, a 100BASE-T Ethernet LAN is capable of carrying: data over rwisted pair cabling at 100 Mb/s. Message Latency on die LAN is relatively high, however, generally on the order of milliseconds, due mainly to collision avoidance mechanisms specified by the 302.3 standard and the lack of a fragmentation mechanism at the S02.3 MAC layer. Another factor contributing to latency in Ethernet LANs is that the minimum frame size permitted by the standard is 64 bytes iplus S more bytes for the<br>
drame preamble and start frame delimiter), while the maximum frame size is more than 1500 bytes.<br>
SIJMMAB.Y OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of some aspects of the present invention to provide methods and devices for enhancing the coverage and speed of WLAN systems.<br>
It is a. further object of some aspects of the present invention to provide methods and devices that enable a wired LAN to be used for high-speed, low-latency communications.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a WLAN system comprises multiple wireless access points distributed within a service region. The access points are linked together by cables in a local area network (LAN), typically an Ethernet LAN, which conveys d ata t o and from m obile s tations s erved b y the access p oints. In order to provide complete coverage of the service region, with strong communication signals throughout the region, the access points are preferably closely spaced, and their areas of coverage may substantially overlap one another, unlike WLANs known in the art.<br>
In order to deal with this overlap, the access points communicate among themselves using a novel, low-latency protocol over the LAN. When a mobile station sends an uplink message attempting to initiate communications hi a given frequency channel, a number of access points operating in this frequency channel may typically receive the message. These access points arbitrate among themselves by sending messages over the LAN, using the novel protocol to determine which access point will respond to the mobile station. The arbitration must be completed promptly, typically well below 10 us. If the access points were limited to communicating over the LAN using Ethernet protocols, they would be unable to complete the arbitration within this tight limit because of the high latency inherent in Ethernet, as described above. Therefore, each access point receiving the uplink message preempts its Ethernet communications immediately, and uses the novel protocol of the present invention instead to send and receive the messages necessary for arbitration. Standard Ethernet trrxsrrdssions may resume afterwards.<br>
'The use of the arbitration mechanism of :he present invention allows access points :o be deployed within the service region as closely as desired while avoiding mutual interference. As a result, mobile stations everywhere in the service region experience good radio coverage, without "black holes/' and can operate at optimal speed. Since the arbitration messaging among the access points takes advantage of on sxisting LAN among the access points (or a<br>
LAN that would be deployed as a DS for the WLAN in any case), the improved performance of the WLAN is achieved without substantial added hardware, by means of a very simple installation procedure.<br>
Although preferred embodiments described herein are directed primarily to improving the coverage of WLAN systems, the principles of the present invention may be applied for other purposes, as well. Thus, the present invention may be employed to provide nodes in a LAN with dual MAC capabilities: a high-throughput MAC layer, such as a lOOMb/s Ethernet MAC 1 ayer, used for g eneral d ata c ommunications; and a s eparate low-latency MAC layer, which is invoked when needed for sending short, high-priority messages, which are typically a microsecond or less in duration. The high-speed MAC can be used, for example, for synchronization and control signals that require low latency, and therefore cannot be carried over Ethernet Ordinarily, in the absence of the low-latency MAC, additional cabling among the nodes would be required to carry these signals. The present invention resolves this deficiency of the prior art, allowing LAN cabling and equipment to be used for dual purposes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram ilia: schematically illustrates a wireless LAN O-^LAN) system 20, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. System 20 comprises multiple access points 22, which are configured for data communication with mobile stations 24. Tlie mobile stations typically comprise computing devices, such as desktop, portable or handheld devices, as shown in the figure. In the exemplary embodiments described<br>
hereinbelow, it is assumed that the access points and mobile stations communicate with one another in accordance with one of the standards in the IEEE 802.11 family and observe the 802.11 medium access control (MAC) layer conventions. Details of the 802.11 MAC layer are described in ANSI/IEEE Standard 801.11 (1999 Edition), and specifically in Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PRY) Specifications, which is incorporated herein, by reference. The principles of the present invention, however, are not limited to the 802.11 standards, and may likewise be applied to substantially any type of "WLAN, including HiperLAN, Bluetooth and hiswan-based systems.<br>
Access points 22 are connected to an Ethernet switching hub 26 by a wired LAN 28, which serves as the distribution system (DS) for exchanging data between the access points and the hub. As noted above, this arrangement enables mobile stations 24 to send and receive data through access points 22 to and from an external network 30, such as the Internet, via an access line 32 connected to hub 26. LAN 2S is typically a 100BASE-TX LAN, operating hi half-duplex mode, as specified by the 802.3 standard. Alternatively, LAN 28 may comprise substantially any Ethernet standard LAN.<br>
As described in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application ("Collaboration between Wireless LAN Access Points"), access points 22 in system 20 are preferably closely spaced, so that radio waves may typically reach mobile station 24 from multiple access points simultaneously on the same frequency channel. By the same token, radio messages transmitted by mobile station 24 may be received at about the same time by multiple access points, hi WLAN systems known in the art, under these circumstances, mobile station 24 would receive downlink messages from two or more of the access points, which would probably result in inability of the mobile station to communicate with any of the access points. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the access points collaborate to resolve this conflict by exchanging arbitration messages with one another using a novel, high-speed protocol over LAN IS, as described aereinbelow. Preferably, die arbitration messages are broadcast by all die access points diat receive on uplink signal nrorn a given mobile station. :o ail :he other access points. Based on die arbitration messages, die access points decide which access point is :o serve a given mobile station (usually die closest access point :o die mobile station, meaning the first access point to send out an arbitration message over LAN 23 in response to a given uplink message). The other access points meanwhile refrain from interfering.<br>
Ordinarily, in a conventional WLAN, when an access point receives an uplink message from a mobile station, it answers immediately with an acknowledgment (ACK). If the mobile station does not receive the ACK within a given timeout period (known as the interframe space, or IPS), typically 10 (is, it subsequently submits an automatic repeat request (ARQ). Ultimately, the mobile station will treat the message exchange as having failed if it repeatedly does not receive the required ACK. Therefore, to maintain 802.11 compatibility in system 20, one — and only one - of the receiving access points must return an ACK to mobile station 24 within the 10 jis limit. This constraint requires that the arbitration process among the access points be completed in substantially less than 10 jis. For this purpose, access points 22 are provided with dual MAC functions: an Ethernet MAC for conventional data communications, and a novel low-latency MAC for arbitration, as described below.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram that schematically shows details of access points 22, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Access point 22 is connected to hub 26 by wires 33 of LAN 28. Hub 26 typically comprises a standard Ethernet switching hub, as is known in the art, which is additionally programmed to recognize and rapidly switch the (non-Ethernet) arbitration messages exchanged among the access points. Access point 22 comprises a physical layer interface (PHY) 34, which transmits and receives signals over wires 33 in accordance with the 1OOBASE-TX P HY1 ayer specification o f the S02.3 standard. Preferably, PHY 34 operates in a half-duplex mode, as provided by the standard.<br>
A multiplexer 35 attaches PHY 34 to two different MAC processors: an Ethernet frame processor 36 and a collaboration message processor 38. As a rule, the multiplexer gives priority to delivering outgoing arbitration messages from the message processor, blocking the frame processor and preempting any transmission of pending Ethernet frames in the meanwhile. Based on these arbitration messages, processor 38 interacts with and controls a WLAN transceiver 37. Transceivers 37 communicate over the air with mobile stations 24 in accordance with the applicable WLAN standard.<br>
'The elements of access point 2 2 shown in Fig. 2 may comprise individual, separate components, or they may alternatively be combined together in a single integrated circuit chip or chip set. Although multiplexer 35 and message processor 38 are novel and unique to the present invention, the other elements of the access point shown in Fig. 2 (including PHY 34, Ethernet frame processor 36 and transceiver 37) are available off-shelf as standard<br>
lomponents. The multiplexer, Ethernet frame processor and message processor may also be implemented as software processes running on a single microprocessor, as long as the processing speed of the microprocessor is sufficient.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram that schematically illustrates a protocol stack implemented by the components of access point 22, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. PHY 34 implements a standard physical layer protocol 42, in accordance with the 802.3 standard, such as the 100BASE-TX protocol. The functions of a MAC protocol layer 44, however, are divided among several components. Ethernet frame processor 36 implements a standard 802.3 MAC protocol 46. Message processor 38, on the other hand, uses a novel low-latency MAC protocol 48 for arbitration messaging among the access points. A combination (COMBO) layer 50 is provided by multiplexer 35 to interface between the physical layer protocol and the alternative MAC protocols.<br>
Preferably, COMBO layer 50 uses a Machine-Independent Interface (ME) to interface with the physical and Ethernet MAC layers, and optionally with low-latency MAC 48, as well. The Mil, as defined in detail in Chapter 22 of the 802.3 standard, provides standard primitives for communication between the Ethernet MAC layer and the 100BASE-TX PHY layer. By using these primitives in the manner provided by the S02.3 standard, the operation of COMBO layer 5 0 is transparent to the Ethernet MAC and PHY layers. In other words, these layers operate in the conventional fashion, and need not be modified to accommodate low-latency MAC 48.<br>
At a higher protocol level, network and application layers 52 are responsible for conveying data to and from mobile stations 24 between WIAN transceiver 37 and LAN 28. These conventional functions are beyond the scope of the present invention, and their implementation will be apparent to those skilled in the arc.<br>
An access point collaboration layer 54 is responsible for generating arbitration messages to be transmitted over LAN 28 via high-speed MAC layer 48 and for receiving and processing incoming arbitration messages from other access points. Layer 54 uses :he arbitration message information to determine which of :he access points should respond ~o a. given uplink message received by transceiver 37 and outputs control signals :o 'he transceiver accordingly. These operations, and associated derails of the operation of low-latency MAC layer 48 and COMBO layer 50. ore described further hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram that schematically illustrates a broadcast packet 60 sent over LAN 28 by one of access points 22, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Packet 60 is used by the access points to convey arbitration messages to the other access points upon receiving uplink communications from one of mobile stations 24, as described below with reference to Fig. 5. The packet comprises a source address (SA) 62, a message body 64 and an error checking code 66, typically a cyclic redundancy code (CRC), as is known in the art.<br>
For rapid communications between the access points, it is desirable that packet 60 be as short as possible, most preferably no more than 16 bits. Thus, SA 62 simply identifies the sending access point, in a unique, proprietary format, which also allows hub 26 to recognize the packet as a broadcast packet. Since the hub distributes the packet to all the access points, there is no need for a destination address. Hub 26 not only has the capabilities of a standard Ethernet switching hub, but also has added hardware and software, capabilities that enable it to recognize packet 60 and distribute it with highest priority. For this purpose, hub 26 preferably includes dedicated broadcast circuitry, since otherwise the standard 802.3 switching circuits would regard packet 60 as erroneous and would therefore drop it Most preferably, hub 26, like a ccess p oint 2 2, h as an a dded a b uffer 1 ayer b etween. t he s tandard P HY1 ayer and two different MAC layers: the standard 802.3 switching MAC and the novel low-latency broadcast MAC of the present invention. Since 100BASE-TX uses synchronous links ("always on"), hub 26 preferably includes an elastic buffer (not shown) for use in broadcasting packet 60 from one input port to many output ports hi parallel.<br>
Message body 64 identifies the mobile station that sent the uplink message reported by packet 60. For efficient communications, the mobile station identification is abridged, by hashing to a 16-bit code, for example. M essage processor 3 8 in e ach o f the access p oints receiving packet 60 decodes SA 62 and message body 64. The message processor thus resolves rhe identities of both the mobile station that sent the uplink message and the access point that received rhe up link message and issued packet 60. Eased on rhe contents of packets uhat it receives and the times at which it receives them. i"he message processor decides whether this access point should respond to the uplink message. Typically, the first access point co send out a broadcast packet in response to a given uplink message is chosen to respond 10 the message. Optionally, message body 64 may include other parameters, such as the power level of the received unlink messase a no/or an identification of the antenna on which the access<br>
point received the message. (For diversity purposes, access points generally have multiple antennas.) These additional parameters may be used, in addition to or instead of the rime of receipt of packet 60. in arbitrating among the access points.<br>
Code 66 is preferably an 8- or 16-bit CRC, which is used by message processor 38 to verify the correctness of the contents of packet 60. Most preferably, code 66 uses a different coding scheme from that provided by the S02.3 standard. As a result, if packet 60 is accidentally passed to Ethernet MAC processor 36, the Ethernet MAC layer will be unable to correctly decode the CRC and will therefore discard the packet.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for establishing communications between mobile station 24 and one of access points 22 in system 20, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Further details of this method are described in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent Application (which uses a dedicated, shared medium to exchange arbitration messages between the access points, rather than LAN 28). Access points 22 transmit beacon signals on their common frequency channel, giving the time base with which the mobile station should synchronize its communications and indicating the BSS identification (BSSID) of the access point. In 802.11 WLAN systems known in the art, each access point has its own unique BSSID. In system 20, however, multiple access points share the same BSSID, so that they appear logically to the mobile station to be a single, extended, distributed access point which has multiple antennas at different locations. The time bases of the accsss points are mutually synchronized using synchronization messages sent over LAN 28 (in the form of packet 6 0), and the b eacon s ignals transmitted b y the access points are interlaced to avoid collision between them.<br>
When mobile station 24 receives a beacon signal of sufficient strength, it extracts the • BSSID and time base rrom the signal, and uses them tosendan uplink message, which is received by one or more of the access points, at an uplink step 70. The actions of the mobile station in this and other steps are completely in accordance with die 302.11 standard. In other •vords. die present invention :an be implemented in a manner diat is by deiinition transparent :o and features no modification of existing mobile stations. Topically, die drst apiink signal sent by the mobile station is an association request message chat is addressed :o die BSSID and indicates die MAC address of die mobile station. Following rhis uplink message, one - and no more than one - of die receiving accsss points must return an ACK to mobile station 2- within die 10 us IPS limit, as -exniained above.<br>
To determine which of the access points will respond to the association request message, access points 22 carry out an arbitration procedure using LAN 28. For this purpose, message processors 38 in all access points that received the uplink message from mobile station 24 prepare broadcast packets 60. at a packet generation step 72, in order to give notice to the other access points that they have received an uplink message. High-speed MAC layer 48 notifies COMBO layer that it has a packet ready to transmit, preferably by setting a transmit enable flag. For example, assuming the high-speed MAC and COMBO layers communicate in accordance with the MH defined by the 802.3 standard, the high-speed MAC layer asserts the TXJEN signal synchronously with the first nibble of the transmitted packet. It continues to assert this flag until the entire packet has been transmitted<br>
As soon as low-latency MAC layer 48 of message processor 38 notifies COMBO layer 50 of multiplexer 35 that it has a packet to transmit the COMBO layer immediately breaks off any Ethernet communications by access point 22, at an Ethernet blocking step 74. Preferably, the COMBO layer notifies Ethernet MAC layer 46 that a collision has been detected on the LAN, by asserting the COL signal provided by the ME of the 802.3 standard. When such a collision condition occurs, the Ethernet MAC layer terminates transmission of any frames in progress, and defers further transmissions as long as the COL flag remains asserted. If the COMBO layer was hi the process of iransrmtting an Ethernet frame, it immediately stops transmission and requests that PHY layer 42 deliberately corrupt the contents of the frame in such a manner that a receiver will detect the corruption with the highest degree of probability. For this purpose, the COMBO layer preferably asserts the TX_ER and TX_EN signals, as provided by the MH, on its interface with the PHY layer. In response, as specified in section 22.2.2.S of the 802.3 standard, the PHY layer will emit one or more symbols that are not part of the valid data or delimiter set provided by the standard. These symbols will cause all receivers of the frames to immediately discard them.<br>
Alter asserting die COL and TXJER flags (preferably for ao more than one clock T erica'). COMBO layer 50 Transmits :he broadcast message prepared, by low-latency MAC layer 48. at a broadcast Transmission step 76. The CCMBO layer preferably asserts the TX_.3N rlag in order :o instruct PHY layer 42 TO Transmit :he packet. Even when :he PHY layer is idle, it continues TO Transmit and receive idle symbols over LAN 2S in order to maintain svncaronization. as mandated bv the S02.3 standard. Therefore, there is essentiailv<br>
no s3/nchrcnizaticn delay involved in beginning to send or receive an arbitration broadcast packet over the LAN.<br>
All access points 22 receive the broadcast packets sent over LAN 2 8, at a message reception step 78. When COMBO layer 50 receives one of the broadcast packets, it passes the packet immediately to low-latency MAC layer 4S. The MAC layer passes the message information to collaboration layer 54, which arbitrates among the access points that sent broadcast packets, at an arbitration step SO, in order to determine which access point will respond to the uplink message received at step 70. The same arbitration takes place at all the access points. Each access point is able to determine whether it was first to send its message, oi whether another access point preceding it by comparing the time of receipt of these broadcast messages to the time at which the access point sent its own broadcast message. (Access points operating on other frequency channels, as well as access points on the same frequency channel that did not receive an uplink signal from the mobile station identified in the broadcast message, may ignore the message.)<br>
Typically, the access point that was able to send its broadcast message first in response to an uplink message from a given mobile station is in a good position to continue communications with the mobile station. Therefore, all the access points independently choose this first access point to respond to mobile station 24. The 802.11 standard supports a large range of data rates for transmission (1 to 54 Mb/s). The mobile station tries to transmit packets as fast as possible, link permitting. Therefore, in general, only the access points that are close enough to the mobile station to receive the high-rate transmission will be in contention to serve the mobile station, and the winning access point must implicitly be among the best receivers of the uplink message in question.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, other criteria, such as received signal power, may be applied in choosing the "winning" access point, as long as the criteria are applied uniformly by ail the access points. Preferably, if a deadlock occurs i.such as when two access poinis send their broadcast messages at die same instant), a predetermined ibrrnuia. "viiich vnay be based on ::he received signal -^ower, is applied by ail the access points :o resolve :he deadlock uniformly.<br>
The winning access point sends 'he required ACK message TO mobile station 24. at an acknowledgment step 32. As noted above. :he ACK must be sent wiihin a short rime, typically 10 ;j.s, and steps "0-30 must ail be completed, within this tune. Access points 12 are able to<br>
meet this time constraint by using LAN 2 S in the manner described above. Alter sending the ACK, the winning access point typically sends an association response message to mobile station 24. and then continues its downlink transmission to the mobile station as appropriate.<br>
The winning access point continues serving the mobile station until the mobile station sends another uplink message. The arbitration protocol described above is then repeated. A different access point may be chosen to serve the mobile station in the next round., particularly if the mobile station has moved in the interim. Even if the mobile station has moved, there is no need to repeat the association protocol. As noted above, all the access points belong to the same ESS, as though they were a single extended access point Therefore, the same association of the mobile station is therefore maintained even if the arbitration process among the access points chooses a different "winner" to respond to the next uplink packet from the mobile station.<br>
The LAN communication architecture shown in Fig. 2 and the protocol stack shown hi Fig. 3 are useful not only in improving the coverage of WLAN systems, as described above, but also in other network communication contexts. As noted above, the present invention may thus be employed to provide nodes in a LAN with dual MAC capabilities: a medium-latency MAC layer, such as an Ethernet MAC layer, used for general data communications; and a separate low-latency MAC layer, which is invoked when needed for sending short, urgent messages. Low-latency MAC layer 48 can be used, for example, for synchronization and control signals that require low latency, and therefore cannot be accommodated by Ethernet MAC layer 46. The high-speed MAC and COMBO layers of the present invention can similarly be used hi a dual-MAC configuration alongside other types of MAC and data link protocol layers known in the art. For example, the low-latency MAC layer could be used in a real-time location system, to use multiple radio propagation measurements to locate people hi an office building or plant.<br>
