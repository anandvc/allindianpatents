This applcation constitutes a Divisional Application divided<br>
out of Indian Application No.1178/CAL/98.<br>
This invention is related to the formation of Program Guides,<br>
system information and program specific information for MPEG<br>
compatible processing.<br>
In video broadcast and processing applications, digital<br>
video data is typically encoded to conform to the requirements of<br>
a known standard. One such widely adopted standard is the MPEG2<br>
(Moving Pictures Expert Sroup) image encoding standard, hereinafter<br>
referred to as the "MPEQ standard". The MPE0 standard is<br>
comprised of a system encoding section (ISO/IEC 13618-1, 10th June<br>
1994) and a video encoding section (ISO/IEC 13818-2), 20th January<br>
1995). Data encoded to the MPE8 standard is in the form of a<br>
packetized datastream which typically includes the data content<br>
of many program channels (e.g. content corresponding to cable<br>
television 1-125). Further, several digital services and channels<br>
may occupy the frequency spectrum previously occupied by a<br>
single analog channel. A 6 MHz bandwith previously allocated to an<br>
analog NTSC compatible broadcast channel may now be split into a<br>
number of digital sub-channels offering a variety of services.<br>
For example, the broadcast spectrum far RF channel 13 may be<br>
allocated to sub-channels including a main program channel, a<br>
final service channel offering stock quotes, a sports news<br>
service channel and a shopping and interactive channel. In<br>
addition, both the quantity of sub-channels transmitted and<br>
the individual sub-channel bandwith may be changed dynamically<br>
to accommodate changing broadcast programming requirements.<br>
In such a digital video system the proliferation in the<br>
quantity of services being broadcast and the increased variety<br>
of their content, as well as the ability of a broadcaster to<br>
dynamically vary the number and allocated bandwith of these<br>
channels poses a number of problems. Specifically, the<br>
increase in the quantity of broadcast channels may increase<br>
the difficulty of................<br>
tuning and lengthen the time required to acquire a selected<br>
program channel. Further, as the quantity of channels increases so<br>
does the quantity of ancillary program specific information<br>
required in decoding the transmitted program data. The ancillary<br>
program specific information includes data used in identifying and<br>
assembling packets comprising selected programs and also<br>
includes program guide and text information associated with the<br>
transmitted program data. The increased quantity and variety of<br>
ancillary information transmitted places an additional burden on<br>
available transmission bandwidth and receiver decoding and<br>
storage resources.<br>
In addition, channel numbering in such a digital video<br>
system may present a problem. This is because a broadcaster may<br>
not want to lose an original analog NTSC broadcast channel<br>
number even though the broadcaster is transmitting several<br>
program channels in the frequency spectrum previously occupied<br>
by the single analog program channel. The broadcaster may have<br>
a significant investment in the channel number as a brand<br>
identity e.g. Fox 5™, Channel 13™. These problems and derivative<br>
problems are addressed by a system according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a digital video system, individual program channels<br>
are allocated first and second identification numbers. The first<br>
identification number (a major number) is associated with an<br>
information provider. The second identification number (a minor<br>
number), is used in identifying a broadcast sub-channel from<br>
among a group of sub-channels associated with the first<br>
identification number. The first and second identification numbers<br>
in conjunction, are used in identifying data constituting a program<br>
transmitted on the broadcast sub-channel.<br>

Figure 1 is a block diagram of a digital video receiving<br>
system for demodulating and decoding broadcast signals,<br>
according to the principles of the invention. Although the<br>
disclosed system is described in the context of a system for<br>
receiving video signals incorporating program specific information<br>
including program guide data in MPEG compatible format, it is<br>
exemplary only. The program specific information may be of a<br>
variety of types. For example, it may comply with Program<br>
Specific Information (PSI) requirements specified in section 2.4.4<br>
of the MPEG systems standard or it may comply with the high<br>
definition television (HDTV) signal standard Digital Television<br>
Standard for HDTV Transmission of April 12 1995, prepared by<br>
the United States Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)<br>
or other ATSC standards. Alternatively, it may be formed in<br>
accordance with proprietary or custom requirements of a<br>
particular system.<br>
The principles of the invention may be applied to<br>
terrestrial, cable, satellite, Internet or computer network<br>
broadcast systems in which the coding type or modulation format<br>
may be varied. Such systems may include, for example, non-MPEG<br>
compatible systems, involving other types of encoded datastreams<br>
and other methods of conveying program specific information.<br>
Further, although the disclosed system is described as processing<br>
broadcast programs, this is exemplary only. The term "program" is<br>
used to represent any form of packetized data such as audio data,<br>
telephone messages, computer programs, Internet data or other<br>
communications, for example.<br>
In overview, in the video receiver system of Figure 1,<br>
a broadcast carrier modulated with signals carrying audio, video<br>
and associated data representing broadcast program content is<br>
received by antenna 10 and processed by unit 13. The resultant<br>
digital output signal is demodulated by demodulator 15. The<br>
demodulated output from unit 15 is trellis decoded, mapped into<br>
byte length data segments, deinterleaved and Reed-Solomon error<br>
corrected by decoder 17. The corrected output data from unit 1 7<br>
is in the form of an MPEG compatible transport datastream<br>
containing program representative multiplexed audio, video and<br>
data components. The transport stream from unit 17 is<br>
demultiplexed into audio, video and data components by unit 2 2<br>
which are further processed by the other elements of decoder<br>
system 100. In one mode, decoder 100 provides MPEG decoded<br>
data for display and audio reproduction on units 50 and 5 5<br>
respectively. In another mode, the transport stream from unit 1 7<br>
is processed by decoder 100 to provide an MPEG compatible<br>
datastream for storage on storage medium 105 via storage device<br>
90.<br>
A user selects for viewing either a TV channel or an<br>
on-screen menu, such as a program guide, by using a remote<br>
control unit 70. Processor 60 uses the selection information<br>
provided from remote control unit 70 via interface 65 to<br>
appropriately configure the elements of Figure 1 to receive a<br>
desired program channel for viewing. Processor 60 comprises<br>
processor 62 and controller 64. Unit 62 processes (i.e. parses,<br>
collates and assembles) program specific information including<br>
program guide and system information and controller 6 4<br>
performs the remaining control functions required in operating<br>
decoder 100. Although the functions of unit 60 may be<br>
implemented as separate elements 62 and 64 as depicted in<br>
Figure 1, they may alternatively be implemented within a single<br>
processor. For example, the functions of units 62 and 64 may b e<br>
incorporated within the programmed instructions of a<br>
microprocessor. Processor 60 configures processor 13,<br>
demodulator 15, decoder 17 and decoder system 100 to<br>
demodulate and decode the input signal format and coding type.<br>
Units 13, 15, 17 and sub-units within decoder 100 are<br>
individually configured for the input signal type by processor 6 0<br>
setting control register values within these elements using a bidirectional<br>
data and control signal bus C.<br>
The transport stream provided to decoder 100<br>
comprises data packets containing program channel data and<br>
program specific information. Unit 22 directs the program specific<br>
information packets to processor 60 which parses, collates and<br>
assembles this information into hierarchically arranged tables.<br>
Individual data packets comprising the User selected program<br>
channel are identified and assembled using the assembled<br>
program specific information. The program specific information<br>
contains conditional access, network information and identification<br>
and linking data enabling the system of Figure 1 to tune to a<br>
desired channel and assemble data packets to form complete<br>
programs. The program specific information also contains ancillary<br>
program guide information (e.g. an Electronic Program Guide -<br>
EPG) and descriptive text related to the broadcast programs as<br>
well as data supporting the identification and assembly of this<br>
ancillary information.<br>
The program specific information is assembled b y<br>
processor 60 into multiple hierarchically arranged and inter-<br>
linked tables. An exemplary hierarchical table arrangement<br>
includes a Master Guide Table (MGT), a Channel Information Table<br>
(CIT), Event Information Tables (EITs) and optional tables such as<br>
Extended Text Tables (ETTs). The MGT contains information for<br>
acquiring program specific information conveyed in other tables<br>
such as identifiers for identifying data packets associated with the<br>
other tables. The CIT contains information for tuning and<br>
navigation to receive a User selected program channel. The EIT<br>
contains descriptive lists of programs (events) receivable on the<br>
channels listed in the CIT. The ETT contains text messages<br>
describing programs and program channels. Additional program<br>
specific information describing and supplementing items within<br>
the hierarchical tables is conveyed within descriptor information<br>
elements. The program specific information acquired by processor<br>
60 via unit 22 is stored within internal memory of unit 60.<br>
Considering Figure 1 in detail, a carrier modulated<br>
with signals carrying program representative audio, video and<br>
associated data received by antenna 10, is converted to digital<br>
form and processed by input processor 13. Processor 13 includes<br>
radio frequency (RF) tuner and intermediate frequency (IF) mixer<br>
and amplification stages for down-converting the input signal to a<br>
lower frequency band suitable for further processing. In this<br>
exemplary system, the input signal received by antenna 1 0<br>
contains 33 Physical Transmission Channels (PTCs 0-32). Each<br>
Physical Transmission Channel (PTC) is allocated a 6 MHz<br>
bandwidth and contains, for example, up to 6 sub-channels.<br>
It is assumed for exemplary purposes that a video<br>
receiver user selects a sub-channel (SC) for viewing using remote<br>
control unit 70. Processor 60 uses the selection information<br>
provided from remote control unit 70 via interface 65 to<br>
appropriately configure the elements of decoder 100 to receive<br>
the PTC corresponding to the selected sub-channel SC. Following<br>
down conversion, the output signal from unit 13 for the selected<br>
PTC has a bandwidth of 6 MHz and a center frequency in the<br>
range of 119-405 MHz. In the following discussion, an RF channel<br>
or Physical Transmission Channel (PTC) refers to an allocated<br>
broadcaster transmission channel band which encompasses one or<br>
more sub-channels (also termed virtual or logical channels).<br>
Processor 60 configures the radio frequency (RF) tuner<br>
and intermediate frequency (IF) mixer and amplification stages of<br>
unit 13 to receive the selected PTC. The down-converted<br>
frequency output for the selected PTC is demodulated by unit 15.<br>
The primary functions of demodulator 15 are recovery and<br>
tracking of the carrier frequency, recovery of the transmitted data<br>
clock frequency, and recovery of the video data itself. Unit 15 also<br>
recovers sampling and synchronization clocks that correspond to<br>
transmitter clocks and are used for timing the operation of<br>
processor 13, demodulator 15 and decoder 17. The recovered<br>
output from unit 15 is provided to decoder 17.<br>
The output from demodulator 15 is mapped into byte<br>
length data segments, deinterleaved and Reed-Solomon error<br>
corrected according to known principles by unit 17. In addition,<br>
unit 17 provides a Forward Error Correction (FEC) validity or lock<br>
indication to processor 60. Reed-Solomon error correction is a<br>
known type of Forward Error Correction. The FEC lock indication<br>
signals that the Reed-Solomon error correction is synchronized to<br>
the data being corrected and is providing a valid output. It is to be<br>
noted that the demodulator and decoder functions implemented<br>
by units 13, 15 and 17 are individually known and generally<br>
described, for example, in the reference text Digital<br>
Communication, Lee and Messerschmidt (Kluwer Academic Press,<br>
Boston, MA, USA, 1988).<br>
The corrected output data from unit 17 is processed<br>
by MPEG compatible transport processor and demultiplexer 22.<br>
The individual packets that comprise either particular program<br>
channel content, or program specific information, are identified b y<br>
their Packet Identifiers (PIDs). Processor 22 separates data<br>
according to type based on an analysis of Packet Identifiers (PIDs)<br>
contained within packet header information and provides<br>
synchronization and error indication information used in<br>
subsequent video, audio and data decompression.<br>
The corrected output data provided to processor 22 is<br>
in the form of a transport datastream containing program channel<br>
content and program specific information for many programs<br>
distributed through several sub-channels. The program specific<br>
information in this exemplary description describes sub-channels<br>
present in a transport stream of a particular PTC. However, in<br>
another embodiment the program specific information may also<br>
describe sub-channels located in other PTCs and conveyed in<br>
different transport streams. Groups of these sub-channels may be<br>
associated in that their source is a particular broadcaster or they<br>
occupy the transmission bandwidth previously allocated to an<br>
analog NTSC compatible broadcast channel. Further, individual<br>
packets that comprise a selected program channel in the transport<br>
stream are identified and assembled by processor 60 operating in<br>
conjunction with processor 22 using PIDs contained in the<br>
program specific information.<br>
The program specific information is in the form of<br>
hierarchically arranged tables including an MGT, CIT, EIT, and ETT<br>
together with supplementary descriptor information. The PID that<br>
identifies packets comprising the MGT data is predetermined and<br>
stored within processor 60 internal memory. Further, the MGT<br>
conveys the PIDs that identify the CIT, EIT, and ETT data and<br>
conveys other information indicating the size of these tables.<br>
Processor 60 monitors the MGT for updates to identify any<br>
changes in PIDs or table sizes. Therefore, after processor 6 0<br>
determines from the FEC lock indication provided by unit 17 that<br>
valid data is being provided to transport processor 22, the MGT<br>
may be acquired without additional PID information. Using Control<br>
signal C, processor 60 configures transport processor 22 to select<br>
the data packets comprising the remaining program specific<br>
information including the CIT, EIT and ETT data. Processor 2 2<br>
matches the PIDs of incoming packets provided by unit 17 with<br>
PID values pre-loaded in control registers within unit 22 by<br>
processor 60. Further, processor 60 accesses, parses and<br>
assembles the program specific information packets captured b y<br>
processor 22 and stores the program specific information within<br>
its internal memory. Processor 60 derives tuning parameters<br>
including PTC carrier frequency, demodulation characteristics, and<br>
sub-channel PIDs, from the acquired program specific information.<br>
Processor 60 uses this information in configuring units 13, 15, 1 7<br>
and decoder 100 elements to acquire selected sub-channel (SC)<br>
program content.<br>
The program specific information including MGT, CIT,<br>
EIT, and ETT data and associated descriptors acquired and collated<br>
by processor 60 incorporates advantageous features exemplified<br>
in the data formats presented in Figures 2-9. These features<br>
facilitate the identification, acquisition, assembly and decoding of<br>
program channel content and associated program guide data b y<br>
decoder 100 (Figure 1). Processor 60 forms a MGT as exemplified<br>
by the data format of Figure 2 by accessing and assembling the<br>
program specific information packets that are stored in the unit<br>
60 internal memory. The MGT contains data identifiers e.g.<br>
PID_ETT 205 and PID_PG 210 (Figure 2) enabling the assembly of<br>
the CIT, EIT and ETT tables. Processor 60 uses the MGT data<br>
identifiers to access and assemble the program specific<br>
information packets to form the CIT, EIT, and ETT data and<br>
associated descriptors.<br>
Processor 60 uses the acquired CIT channel map<br>
information, as exemplified in Figure 3, to identify the packets<br>
comprising the sub-channel SC that the User selected to view. A<br>
user selects sub-channel SC for viewing by entering two program<br>
channel numbers via remote control unit 70 and interface 65.<br>
Individual program channels are advantageously allocated both a<br>
first and a second identification number. The first identification<br>
number (a major number as indicated by bundle_number 300 in<br>
Figure 3) identifies the broadcast source and broadcaster channel<br>
brand number e.g. Fox 5™, Channel 13™. The first identification<br>
number indicates a broadcast source of a program or service and<br>
may be independent of the RF channel on which the program is<br>
broadcast. However, in other embodiments the first identification<br>
number may be associated with a broadcast RF channel or be<br>
associated with other program characteristics such as a program<br>
category or theme e.g. movies. The second identification number<br>
(a minor number as indicated by channel_number_in_bundle 305<br>
in Figure 3) identifies a sub-channel corresponding to a specific<br>
service within a group of services provided by a broadcaster. The<br>
first and second identification numbers in conjunction identify a<br>
particular service as a sub-channel provided by a specific<br>
broadcaster. Although, the selected sub-channel SC may occupy an<br>
RF bandwidth within an encompassing channel spectrum<br>
associated with the broadcast source, neither the first or second<br>
identification numbers are associated with such a spectrum.<br>
However, this association may be made in an alternative<br>
embodiment. This dual numbering system enables a broadcaster<br>
to retain channel brand identity across a range of dynamically<br>
allocable broadcast sub-channels.<br>
The dual program channel identification numbers used<br>
to select sub-channel SC may be entered by the user in a variety<br>
of ways. These may include using remote unit 70 to select sub-<br>
channel SC from within a hierarchical menu system displaying<br>
program channel selections in a program guide or by simple<br>
sequential number entry via the unit 70 keypad, for example. The<br>
channel selection system may also encompass the use of a<br>
different data entry device such as a keyboard or discrete<br>
switches, for example. Further, the data entry system also<br>
accommodates the entry of a single channel identification number<br>
as well as dual identification numbers. Upon detecting a channel<br>
selection completion command, processor 60 converts a single<br>
channel identification number entry into dual identification<br>
numbers. Processor 60 converts the single channel identification<br>
number to dual channel identification numbers in accordance with<br>
a predetermined conversion map. This conversion may also be<br>
performed using a predetermined and stored algorithm or<br>
formula. The derived dual identification numbers are used b y<br>
processor 60 for packet identification, tuning and for identifying<br>
other decoder information in the manner previously described as<br>
if both numbers had been entered by a user.<br>
Processor 60 uses the received program channel<br>
identification numbers 300 and 305 provided from remote control<br>
unit 70 via interface 65 to determine the PTC corresponding to the<br>
selected sub-channel SC from the CIT. Once the PTC number (item<br>
315 in Figure 3) is determined, processor 60 (Figure 1) configures<br>
units 13, 15, and 17 to receive the PTC for the selected sub-<br>
channel SC. The unique program sub-channel determined from the<br>
program channel identification numbers 300 and 305 may<br>
alternatively be termed a service or a virtual channel or a logical<br>
channel and the CIT may be deemed a virtual channel table.<br>
Further, as well as associating a particular PTC with first and<br>
second sub-channel identification numbers 300 and 305 of<br>
selected sub-channel SC, the CIT also associates other parameters<br>
with SC. These parameters include (a) a channeled 320 for linking<br>
the selected sub-channel SC with program content information<br>
conveyed in the EITs, (b) a channel_type indicator 325 identifying<br>
whether the sub-channel data is, analog e.g. NTSC, digital video<br>
e.g. ATSC video or digital audio e.g. ATSC audio, (c) an ETM_flag<br>
330 indicating whether a text message is available for this sub-<br>
channel, (d) a channel name 340 and (e) a descriptor 335 e.g. a<br>
Service Location Descriptor as described later.<br>
Processor 60 advantageously determines program map<br>
information for the selected sub-channel SC from Service Location<br>
Descriptor (SLD) conveyed within the CIT. The SLD program map<br>
information is exemplified by the data format of Figure 4. The SLD<br>
associates the selected sub-channel SC with packet identifiers, e.g.<br>
item 420, used to identify individual packetized datastreams that<br>
constitute the components of a program being transmitted on<br>
selected sub-channel SC. In addition, the SLD program map<br>
information, in conjunction with the CIT, maps the selected sub-<br>
channel SC to a program number 405, a PCR (Program Clock<br>
Reference) identifier 410, a language code indicator 425, and a<br>
stream type identifier 415 identifying a stream as video, audio,<br>
control, auxiliary or private information, for example.<br>
The SLD program map information replicates<br>
information already present within the Program Map Table (PMT)<br>
segment of the MPEG compatible transport stream input to<br>
decoder 100. However, by incorporating the SLD within the CIT,<br>
the time required by decoder 100 to identify and acquire a<br>
program being transmitted on selected sub-channel SC is<br>
advantageously reduced. This is because the CIT and SLD provide<br>
formatted and linked information sufficient to enable processor<br>
60 to directly configure and tune the system of Figure 1 to receive<br>
the selected sub-channel SC. Specifically, the CIT and SLD directly<br>
associate individual first and second sub-channel identification<br>
numbers with the PIDs for identifying the datastreams that<br>
constitute a program being conveyed on this sub-channel. This<br>
enables processor 60 to configure the system of Figure 1 to<br>
receive the selected sub-channel SC without acquiring and using<br>
the Program Map Table (PMT) information in the MPEG<br>
compatible transport stream input to decoder 100. In addition, the<br>
data partitioning, data formatting and data repetition frequency<br>
characteristics of the CIT and SLD program map information may<br>
be determined independently of the requirements of MPEG PMT<br>
information.<br>
The packetized decoded transport stream input to<br>
decoder 100 from unit 17 contains video, audio and data<br>
representing TV programs, for example, and also contains sub-<br>
picture data. The sub-picture data contains picture elements<br>
associated with programs and channels selectable by a user for<br>
viewing including program guides, display commands, subtitling,<br>
selectable menu options or other items, for example. As such, the<br>
sub-picture data includes the EIT containing descriptive lists of<br>
programs (events) receivable on the sub-channels listed in the CIT<br>
and also contains the ETT containing text messages describing<br>
programs and program sub-channels.<br>
Processor 60 determines from the CIT and SLD the<br>
PIDs of the video, audio and sub-picture streams constituting the<br>
program being transmitted on selected sub-channel SC. Processor<br>
22, matches the PIDs of incoming packets provided by decoder 1 7<br>
with PID values of the video, audio and sub-picture streams being<br>
transmitted on sub-channel SC. These PID values are pre-loaded<br>
in control registers within unit 22 by processor 60. In this<br>
manner, processor 22 captures packets constituting the program<br>
transmitted on sub-channel SC and forms them into MPEG<br>
compatible video, audio and sub-picture streams for output to<br>
video decoder 25, audio decoder 35 and sub-picture processor 3 0<br>
respectively. The video and audio streams contain compressed<br>
video and audio data representing the selected sub-channel SC<br>
program content. The sub-picture data contains the EIT and ETT<br>
information associated with the sub-channel SC program content.<br>
Decoder . 25 decodes and decompresses the MPEG<br>
compatible packetized video data from unit 22 and provides<br>
decompressed program representative pixel data to NTSC encoder<br>
45 via multiplexer 40. Similarly, audio processor 35 decodes the<br>
packetized audio data from unit 22 and provides decoded and<br>
amplified audio data, synchronized with the associated<br>
decompressed video data, to device 55 for audio reproduction.<br>
Processor 30 decodes and decompresses sub-picture data received<br>
from unit 22.<br>
The sub-picture data decoded by processor 3 0<br>
includes text messages (Extended Text Messages - ETMs) in an ETT<br>
in the exemplary data format presented in Figure 5. The text<br>
messages conveyed in the ETT of Figure 5 are advantageously<br>
partitioned into time periods of specified duration. The segmented<br>
text messages describe programs occurring in a period of specified<br>
duration and start time e.g. 3 hour blocks starting from 12 a.m., 3<br>
p.m., 6 p.m.... etc. Indicators defining the duration and start time<br>
applicable to the conveyed text messages are included in the MGT<br>
of Figure 2 (duration item 215 and application_time item 220 of<br>
Figure 2 respectively). A text message (e.g.<br>
extended_text_message 505) is conveyed together with a text<br>
message identifier (ETM_id 510) in the format of Figure 5.<br>
Decoder 100 (Figure 1) is able to more efficiently<br>
acquire, process and store program descriptive text messages that<br>
are partitioned into time periods of specified duration than is<br>
possible in the absence of such segmentation. This is because<br>
segmented text messages exclude information occurring outside<br>
the specified time period and consequently are smaller than non-<br>
segmented text messages. Therefore, segmented text message data<br>
occupies less storage space and can be acquired and processed<br>
more quickly than larger data blocks of non-segmented data.<br>
Further, the data format of Figure 5 allows a user to acquire text<br>
message data for a selected sub-channel SC or a group of selected<br>
program sub-channels. This allows the identification, acquisition<br>
and decoding of text message data by decoder 100 to be focused<br>
on the programs and sub-channels of interest to a user and<br>
reduces the acquisition of redundant text message information.<br>
A text message conveyed in an ETT may contain<br>
channel information or program (event) information. Figure 6<br>
shows an exemplary format for assigning a text message identifier<br>
ETM_id 510 of Figure 5 that identifies the type of text message<br>
e.g. whether the text message contains channel information (item<br>
610 of Figure 6) or program information (item 605 of Figure 6).<br>
The text message identifier 510 (Figure 5) also identifies the<br>
source e.g. sub-channel to which the text message pertains.<br>
A text message 505 conveyed in the ETT of Figure 5 is<br>
compressed and formatted according to the multiple compressed<br>
text string format of Figure 7. The compressed text string format<br>
advantageously incorporates indicators facilitating the<br>
identification and decoding of multiple compressed text strings b y<br>
processor 30 in decoder 100 of Figure 1. Processor 30 decodes text<br>
string 505 (Figure 5) received from unit 22 (Figure 1) by<br>
determining the compression, coding and language characteristics<br>
of the text string from indicators 705, 710 and 715 (Figure 7)<br>
respectively. Specifically, processor 30, operating in conjunction<br>
with processor 60, decompresses received text string 505 b y<br>
applying a decompression function e.g. a Huffman decompression<br>
function, selected using indicator 705. Similarly, processor 30,<br>
decodes the received text string by applying a decoding function<br>
interpreting text characters according to a character code set<br>
selected using indicator 710 and a language code set selected<br>
using indicator 715. Further, processor 30 determines the number<br>
of text strings to be processed and the number of bytes in each<br>
text string from indicators 725 and 720 respectively.<br>
Figure 8 shows an exemplary indicator definition for<br>
compression indicator 705 within the multiple compressed text<br>
string format of Figure 7. It is to be noted that compression<br>
indicator 705 may indicate that no compression function is<br>
employed within a text string. In this case, processor 30 does not<br>
apply a decompression function to the text string received from<br>
unit 22. Figure 9 shows an exemplary indicator definition for<br>
coding indicator 710 within the multiple compressed text string<br>
format of Figure 7.<br>
Processor 30 assembles and formats the decoded and<br>
decompressed text string elements of text string 505 (Figure 5) to<br>
form a decoded text string for output to On-Screen Display (OSD)<br>
and graphics generator 37 (Figure 1). Unit 37 interprets and<br>
formats the text string character data from unit 30 and generates<br>
formatted pixel mapped text and graphics for presentation on unit<br>
50. The formatted pixel mapped text and graphics data may<br>
represent a program guide or other type of menu or user interface<br>
for subsequent display on unit 50. Unit 37 also processes EIT, ETT<br>
and other information to generate pixel mapped data<br>
representing, subtitling, control and information menu displays<br>
including selectable menu options, and other items, for<br>
presentation on unit 50. The control and information displays<br>
enable function selection and entry of device operating<br>
parameters for User operation of decoder 100.<br>
The text and graphics produced by OSD generator 3 7<br>
are generated in the form of overlay pixel map data under<br>
direction of processor 60. The overlay pixel map data from unit 37<br>
is combined and synchronized with the decompressed pixel<br>
representative data from MPEG decoder 25 in encoder 45 via<br>
multiplexer 40 under direction of processor 60. Combined pixel<br>
map data representing a video program on sub-channel SC<br>
together with associated sub-picture text message data is encoded<br>
by NTSC encoder 45 and output to device 50 for display.<br>
In a storage mode of the system of Figure 1, the<br>
corrected output data from unit 17 is processed by decoder 100 to<br>
provide an MPEG compatible datastream for storage. In this mode,<br>
a program is selected for storage by a user via remote unit 70 and<br>
interface 65. Processor 22, in conjunction with processor 60 forms<br>
condensed program specific information including MGT, CIT, EIT<br>
and ETT data and descriptors containing the advantageous<br>
features previously described. The condensed program specific<br>
information supports decoding of the program selected for storage<br>
but excludes unrelated information. Processor 60, in conjunction<br>
with processor 22 forms a composite MPEG compatible datastream<br>
containing packetized content data of the selected program and<br>
associated condensed program specific information. The composite<br>
datastream is output to storage interface 95.<br>
Storage interface 95 buffers the composite datastream<br>
to reduce gaps and bit rate variation in the data. The resultant<br>
buffered data is processed by storage device 90 to be suitable for<br>
storage on medium 105. Storage device 90 encodes the buffered<br>
datastream from interface 95 using known error encoding<br>
techniques such as channel coding, interleaving and Reed Solomon<br>
encoding to produce an encoded datastream suitable for storage.<br>
Unit 90 stores the resultant encoded datastream incorporating the<br>
condensed program specific information on medium 105.<br>
Figure 10 shows a method for generating program<br>
specific information including MGT, CIT, EIT and ETT data and<br>
descriptors containing the advantageous features previously<br>
described. The method may be employed at an encoder for<br>
broadcasting video data such as the data received by antenna 1 0<br>
of Figure 1 or the method may be employed within a decoder unit<br>
such as within processor 60 of Figure 1.<br>
Following the start at step 800 of Figure 10, a CIT is<br>
generated in step 810. The CIT contains sub-channel and program<br>
identification information enabling acquisition of available<br>
broadcast programs and sub-channels. The CIT incorporates first<br>
and second sub-channel identification numbers and an SLD<br>
containing packet identifiers for identifying individual packetized<br>
datastreams that constitute individual programs to be transmitted<br>
on particular sub-channels. The generated CIT also incorporates<br>
items linked to listed program sub-channels including a program<br>
number, a PCR (Program Clock Reference) identifier, a language<br>
code indicator, and a stream type identifier, as previously<br>
described in connection with Figure 1.<br>
In step 815, an EIT is generated containing program<br>
guide information including descriptive lists of programs (events)<br>
receivable on the sub-channels listed in the CIT. In step 820, an<br>
ETT is generated containing text messages describing programs,<br>
for example. Each text message is partitioned into time periods of<br>
specified duration. The duration and application time of the<br>
segmented text message data is also defined by indicators in the<br>
ETT itself. The text message data is encoded and compressed<br>
according to known techniques and conveyed in the ETT along<br>
with indicators defining the compression, coding and language<br>
characteristics employed. The ETT is also generated to include<br>
indicators defining the number of text strings to be processed and<br>
the number of bytes in each text string. In step 822 an MGT is<br>
generated containing data identifiers enabling the identification<br>
and assembly of CIT, EIT and ETT information. The MGT also<br>
conveys table size information for the previously generated CIT,<br>
EIT and ETT.<br>
In step 825, program specific information is formed<br>
including the MGT, CIT, EIT and ETT data and descriptors<br>
generated in steps 805-822. In step 830, the program specific<br>
information together with video and audio program<br>
representative components for multiple sub-channels is formatted<br>
into a transport stream for output. In step 835, the output<br>
transport stream is further processed to be suitable for<br>
transmission to another device such as a receiver, video server, or<br>
storage device for recording on a storage medium, for example.<br>
The processes performed in step 835 include known encoding<br>
functions such as data compression Reed-Solomon encoding,<br>
interleaving, scrambling, trellis encoding, and carrier modulation.<br>
The process is complete and terminates at step 840. In the process<br>
of Figure 10, multiple CIT, EIT and ETT tables may be formed and<br>
incorporated in the program specific information in order to<br>
accommodate expanded numbers of sub-channels.<br>
The architecture of Figure 1 is not exclusive. Other<br>
architectures may be derived in accordance with the principles of<br>
the invention to accomplish the same objectives. Further, the<br>
functions of the elements of decoder 100 of Figure 1 and the<br>
process steps of Figure 10 may be implemented in whole or in<br>
part within the programmed instructions of a microprocessor. I n<br>
addition, the principles of the invention apply to any form of<br>
MPEG or non-MPEG compatible electronic program guide. A<br>
datastream formed according to the invention principles may b e<br>
used in a variety of applications including video server or PC type<br>
communication via telephone lines, for example. A program<br>
datastream with one or more components of video, audio and data<br>
formed to incorporate program specific information according to<br>
invention principles may be recorded on a storage medium and<br>
transmitted or re-broadcast to other servers, PCs or receivers.<br>
Further, any reference herein to "bandwidth" is to be interpreted<br>
expansively to include bit rate capacity and is not limited to a<br>
frequency spectrum, for example.<br>
