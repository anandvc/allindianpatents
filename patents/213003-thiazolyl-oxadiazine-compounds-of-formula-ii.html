The Examples that follow more particularly describe the invention. They do not limit the invention. Temperatures are stated In degrees centigrade. Percentages represent  percent by weight", unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Example HI: 2-Benzylthio-5-chloromel:hyl-thiazole (Compound No. 1.9 In Table 1)<br>
3.2 g of 2-benzylthio-5~methylene-4H-l:hlazoline are dissolved in 50 ml of dichloromethane, and 0.9 g of pulverulent sodium bicarbonate are added with stirring. The mixture is subsequently cooled in an ice bath, 1 .92 g of sulfuryl chloride in 5 ml of dichloromethane are added drop wise, and stirring is then continued for a further 45 minutes. The reaction mixture is filtered, the filtrate is evaporated, and the residue is recrystallizod from petroleum ether, yielding 1 .4 g of the title compound in the form of crystals melting at 57 to 58°.<br>
Example H2: 3-(2-Benzylmiothlazol-5-ylmethyl)-5-methyl--nltrolmlno-pehiydro-1,3,5-oxadlazlne (Compound No. 2.9 in Table 2)<br>
0.8 g of 2-benzylthlo-5-chloromethyUthlazole, 0.35 g of 3 methyl-4 nitrolmlno-perhydro-1 ,3,5-oxadiazine and 0.8 g of pulverulent potassium carbonate are mixed in 40 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, and the mixture Is stirred at 60° for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is filtered, the filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue  is digested in diethyl ether/isopropanol (5:1), yielding 0.6 g of the title compound in the form of crystals melting at 140 to 145° (decomposition).<br>
Example H3: 3-(2-Chlorothiazol~5-vlmethvn-5-methyl-4~nitroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadlazine (Compound No. 11.1 in Table 11)<br>
2 g of 3-(2'benzylthiothiazol-5-ylmethyl)-5-methyl-4-nltroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine are dissolved In a mixture of 10 ml of 4N aqueous hydrochloric acid, 20 g of ice and 30 ml of dichloromethane, and 30 g of Javelle water are added dropwlse with stirring to the solution. After stirring for a further 30 minutes, the organic phase Is separated off, the aqueous phase is extracted repeatedly with a little dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases are subsequently dried with sodium sulphate and evaporated under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and precipitated with hexane, whereby the product deposits on the walls of the vessel as a sticky material. The solvent Is decanted, the residue Is redlssolved In tetrahydrofuran, and the solution is slowly concentrated, yielding 0.84 g of the title compound in the form of a semi-crystalline resin. A sample of this resin is purified by chromatography [silica gel; dichloromethane/methanol (95:5)), yielding crystals melting at 132 to 1350.<br>
Example H4: 3-(2-Chlorothiazol-5-ylmethyl)-5-methyl-4-nitroimino-perhydro-1.3.5-oxadlazlne (Compound No. 11.1 In Table 11)<br>
To a mixture of 300 g of aqueous hydrochloric acid (32%) and 150 g of chlorobenzene are added with stirring 183 g of 5-mothyl-4-nltroimino-3-(2-phenylthlothlazol-5-ylmethyl)-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine within 5 minutes. 124 g of chlorine are then passed into the mixture at 20 to 25° over a period of 4 hours. After stirring for a further 2 hours, the excess of chlorine is removed by introduction of nitrogen, and the aqueous phase (containing the title compound in hydrochloride form) is separated off and adjusted to pH 5 with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (30%). The crystalline precipitate is filtered off, washed with water and dried at 50* in vacuo, yielding 132 g of the title compound (purity: 97%) melting at 132 to 135°.<br>
Example H5:3-(2-Chlorothlazol'-5'ylmethyl)-5-methyl-4-nitrolmino-perhydro- 1,3,5-oxadlazine (Compound No. 11.1 in Table 11)<br>
To a mixture of 300 g of aqueous hydrochloric acid (32%) and 150 g of chlorobenzene are added with stirring 186 g of 3-(2-cyclohexylthiothlazol-5-ylmethyl)-5-methyl-4-nitrolmino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine within 5 minutes. 124 g of chlorine are then passed Into the mixture at 20 to 25° over a period of 4 hours. After stirring for a further 2 hours, the excess of chlorine is removed by Introduction of nitrogen, and the aqueous phase (containing the<br>
title compound in hydrochloride form) is separated off and adjusted to pH 5 with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (30%). The crystalline precipitate la filtered off, washed with water and dried at 50° in vacuo, yielding 135 g of the title compound (purity: 97%) melting at 132 to 135°.<br>
Example H6:3-(2-Chlorothiazol-5-ylmethyh'5-methyl-4-nitrolmino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadlazlne (Compound No. 11.1 in Table 11)<br>
To a mixture of 300 g of aqueous hydrochloric acid (32%) and 150 g of chlorobenzene are added with stirring 190 g of 3-(2-benzylthiothlazol-5-ylmethyl)-5-methyl-4-nllroimlno-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadlazine within 5 minutes. 124 g of chlorine are then passed into the mixture at 20 to 25° over a period of 4 hours. After stirring for a further 2 hours, the excess of chlorine is removed by introduction ol nitrogen, and the aqueous phase (containing the title compound in hydrochloride form) is separated off and adjusted to pH 5 with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (30%), The crystalline precipitate is filtered off, washed with water and dried at 50" in vacuo, yielding 120 g of the title compound (purity: 97%) melting at 132 to 135°,<br>
Example H7:2-BenzylthiO'5-methylene-4H-thiazoline (Compound No. 1.8 in Table 1a)<br>
A mixture of 6.5 g of 5-methylene-2-thloxo-thiazo!idine, 17.3 g of pulverulent potassium carbonate, 9.4 g of benzyl bromide and 200 ml of acetonltrlle Is stirred for 1 hour at 630. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then filtered, and the filtrate Is evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue Is purified by chromatography [silica gel; hoxane/di-ethyl ether {1 ;1)], yielding 7.7 g of the title compound In the form of a colourless oil.<br>
Example H8: Analogously to the procedures described in Examples 111 to H7, also the other compounds listed in Tables 1 to 13 can be prepared. The temperatures stated in the column "Physical data" of these tables in each case denote the melting point of the respective compound; "decomp." means decomposition.<br>
