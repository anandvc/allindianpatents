FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the concept of replacing a particular font in a document comprising one or more fonts with another font using a menu that displays all the fonts present in a document. More particularly the present invention relates a method of taking print outs with different fonts without modifying the document.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Presently whenever user has to print a document with the different fonts in the original document the user has to change the font through out the document which is no doubt a tedious task. He has to manually select the font and apply the change font setting hence the whole document reformatting needs to be done.<br>
The document which needs formatting would be done at the driver level. The user has to just select the font to be replaced with the new one. The user also has to specify the size of the new replaced font otherwise the size similar to the old one would be taken into account.<br>
A US Patent no. 20040051893 A1, titled "Document Printing Control Apparatus and Method" describes a provision of a document printing control apparatus. The patent application also describes a method capable of revising an area and font size. The method checks the minimum value of the font size to be output considering the<br><br>
results of the placement in the individual elements and calculation of the font size. The patent application describes a method for improving the intelligibility of the document in the print form of the document. However, the patent does not mention replacing one font type with another.<br>
In another Patent publication no. WO2004015588A2, titled "Electronic Document Processing" describes that the attributes of an electronic document such as word wrapping, text resizing, text repositioning and other text manipulations can be done using computer software. The attributes include the font and font size. The patent application also describes that the computer software automatically selects a font size. The font size is selected with reference to the size of the original text. The patent application further describes that both text and image objects in an electronic document can be manipulated.<br>
However, the concept of replacing a particular font in a document comprising one or more fonts with another font using a menu that displays all the fonts present in a document has not been identified in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to make the formatting of the documents easier.<br><br>
The invention relates to replacing one font from a document with another font without making a manual search for the font to be replaced. Further, the invention also takes care of the formatting changes that may arise due to change of font. The formatting changes include changing the size of the new font with a suitable size. The invention is particularly useful in a printer driver, where it may happen that a printer driver does not support a particular font.<br>
A User Interface (Ul) is made available for configuring the user settings. In the Ul, the user can see the fonts used in a document in combo box selection. The fonts to be replaced will contain the fonts supported by the printer/driver. Once the new font is selected, the most appropriate size for the new font would be automatically selected. If the user wishes to change the same then user can change it using size combo box. Also, there is a provision of showing the preview of font replaced and selected. The alignment and settings of the document would be done according to user settings.<br>
The Ul captures all the user settings. All the fonts used and their size in the document would be populated in the Ul. The user can select the choice for example, he/she wants to replace 'X' font of size 'Y' with the possible fonts available. All the fonts available on the system would be populated along with the possible size. Once the user selects the desired font, the information will be passed to a user interface module. The user interface module will call spooler service that initiates the print job. The Ul settings would be passed to the print processor and the<br><br>
font replace would be done at next level means in render module. If the desired font is not available then the same can be installed for replacing it.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method of taking print outs with different fonts without modifying the document comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	opening the document and selecting a particular print driver which is having the font replacement facility by the user;<br>
(b)	prompting for the Ul through which the user selects the fonts available in the document along with the font size;<br>
(c)	selecting existing font and font to be replaced by the user where the said settings are stored and passed to the printer driver;<br>
(d)	storing the said document in the hard disk if requested by the user;<br>
(e)	spooling the said document by the spooler component and passing the document to the print processor component;<br>
(f)	replacing the font at the print processor level or render level or at both the stages according to the printer driver implementation; and<br>
(g)	printing the formatted document.<br>
Replacement of the font is generally done at the render level where the data is read by the driver and an image is formed which is sent to the printer. The render module has the access of the fonts present in the document as it parses it before sending it to the printer. The render module checks for the fonts available and if the user requests for any font replacement then the font is replaced during parsing of the font. The Ul, the user views the fonts used in a document and the Ul populates the<br><br>
fonts used in making the document in a combo box selection. A size combo box gets updated according to the font selection by the user. The fonts to be replaced contain the fonts supported by the printer driver and new fonts get added to the list if the support is provided for the said addition. The option of adding the new fonts is provided if the font list do not populate automatically. The most appropriate size is populated in the combo box once the font is selected and if the user changes the size then the said size is changed using Size combo box. Before an application draws text with a logical font, it finds the closest match from the fonts stored internally on the device and the fonts whose resources are loaded into the operating system. A font mapping is performed between the physical fonts which are fonts stored on the device or in the operating system and a specified logical font. The Ul captures all the user settings and all the fonts available on the system gets populated along with the possible size in the said Ul and the user selects the font and size to be changes to the new font and size using the said Ul. If the fonts are already installed in the system the print driver parses the document and replaces with the font asked for and if the font is not available then the said font is installed. The formatted document after the font replacement is stored in the memory.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates Ul for configuring the user settings.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram which explains the Ul used for selecting the font for replacement.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
There would be a separate Ul for configuring the user settings. A sample of the same is shown in Fig 1<br>
In the Ul the user can see the fonts used in a document i.e. the Ul will populate the fonts used in making the document in combo box selection. The size combo box will also be updated according to the font selection. Suppose the user has used Courier New font in the document of size 8 and 12. Then the Fonts in the document list will<br><br>
contain the Courier new font and the Size will have only two entries i.e. 8 and 12. Similarly all fonts will have valid size value.<br>
Figure 2 shows the complete flow of the method. When the user opens the document and selects a particular print driver which is having the font replacement facility then the user would be prompted for the Ul through which he/she can select the fonts available in the document along with the font size. Once the user selects existing font and font to be replaced the settings are stored and passed to the printer driver. If the user has requested to store the document then same would also be stored in the hard disk. At this stage the document is spooled by the spooler component, which is a windows/operating system standard service, and passed to the print processor component. According to the printer driver implementation the font replacement could be done at print processor level or render level or at both the stages. Generally it is done at the render level where the data is read by the driver and an image is formed which is sent to the printer. Render module has the access of the fonts present in the document as it parses it before sending it to the printer. The render module checks for the fonts available and if the user has requested for any font replacement then the same would be replaced during parsing of the font.<br>
The fonts to be replaced will contain the fonts supported by the printer/driver. New fonts can be added to this list if the support is provided for the same. We can have the option of adding the new fonts if it does not populate automatically. Once the font is selected the most appropriate size would be populated in the combo box. If the user wishes to change the same then user can change it using Size combo box<br><br>
There would be a provision of showing the preview of font replaced and selected. In the Fig 1 the user wished to replace the Courier New font of size 8 with Times New Roman font with size 14.<br>
Before an application can actually begin drawing text with a logical font, it must find the closest match from the fonts stored internally on the device and the fonts whose resources have been loaded into the operating system. The fonts stored on the device or in the operating system are called physical fonts. The process of finding the physical font that most closely matches a specified logical font is called font mapping.<br>
This idea would be having a Ul which will capture all the user settings. All the fonts used and their size in the document would be populated. The user can select the choice for example he/she wants to replace "X" font of size "Y" with the possible fonts available. All the fonts available on the system would be populated along with the possible size. So user has to select the font and size to be changes to the new font and size.<br>
Once the user selects OK the information would be passed to the Ul interface module. In turn Ul module will call spooler service which is responsible in initiating the print job. All the Ul settings would be passed to the print processor and the font replace would be done at next level means in render module.<br><br>
Since the fonts are already installed in the system the driver will parse the document and will replace with the font asked for. If the font is not available then the same can be installed for replacing it.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another. This invention is however, susceptible to modifications and alternate constructions from that disclosed above which are fully equivalent. Consequently, it is not the intention to limit this invention to the particular embodiment disclosed.
