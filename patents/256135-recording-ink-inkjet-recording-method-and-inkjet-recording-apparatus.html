DESCRIPTION<br>
[Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to recording ink appropriate<br>
for inkjet recording, an Inkjet recording method and an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
A coloring agent for inkjet recording ink is mainly based<br>
on-a dye, and there are disadvantages that the dye ink is<br>
inferior in water resistance and weather resistance and also<br>
easily oozes out on plain paper. In order to eliminate these<br>
disadvantages, such ink has been proposed that pigments, for<br>
example, carbon black, are used.<br>
The pigment ink is excellent in water resistance and<br>
weather resistance and also able to record images which ooze<br>
out to a less extent but is inferior in fixing property, which is a<br>
problem. Therefore, an attempt has been made that various<br>
resins are added to improve the fixing property.<br>
For example, Patent Literature 1 has described a<br>
recording solution which contains carbon black and a soap-free<br>
emulsion. In records obtained by using the above-described<br>
recording solution, a resin emulsion forms a film after drying of<br><br>
ink to fix a pigment, thereby imparting scratch resistance and<br>
water resistance, but carbon black contained in the recording<br>
solution is dispersed by a surfactant and therefore does not have<br>
a hydrophilic group directly on the surface. There is found a<br>
disadvantage that the above-described recording solution<br>
dispersed by a surfactant is poor in dispensability due to<br>
detachment of the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the<br>
pigment with the lapse of time and may easily increase in<br>
viscosity and cause aggregation.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 2 has described a method in<br>
which hypohalogen is used to acid-treat carbon black. Since<br>
this method is able to introduce an aqueous dispersible<br>
functional group onto the surface by acid treatment of carbon<br>
black, the dispersion stability is better than that attained by<br>
using a surfactant. However, carbon black is known to generate<br>
humic acid due to acid treatment and the dispersion tends to<br>
decrease in pH with the lapse of time, thereby causing a<br>
decrease in dispersion stability and the deterioration of<br>
members inside an ink-used recording apparatus.<br>
Still further, Patent Literature 3 has described an ink<br>
composition containing two or more types of resins in which a<br>
pigment that can be dispersed or dissolved in water without a<br>
dispersing agent is used. Carbon black which is contained in<br>
the above-described ink composition and can be dispersed or<br>
dissolved in water without a dispersing agent is acid-treated by<br><br>
using hypochlorous acid or ozone. Since there are provided no<br>
measures for the pH decrease with the lapse of time due to<br>
elusion of humic acid, the ink is not satisfactory in terms of<br>
storage stability.<br>
In addition, Patent Literature 4 has described that<br>
attention is given to humic acid contained in acid-treated carbon<br>
black and where the concentration of humic acid is found to be<br>
one or lower in terms of the absorbance, there is provided an<br>
excellent feature of preventing clogging at a nozzle or a pen tip<br>
due to the development of solids. However, there is a problem<br>
that where humic acid is abundantly contained in a recording<br>
solution, pH is decreased with the lapse of time to deteriorate<br>
the storage stability.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
recording ink excellent in fixing property and image density on a<br>
recording medium, also excellent in prolonged storage stability<br>
of ink and capable of forming a high-quality image not only on<br>
plain paper or paper exclusively used for inkjet printing but also<br><br>
on coated paper for commercial printing poor in water<br>
absorption, and an inkjet recording method as well as an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus.<br>
In order to solve the above problem, the present inventor<br>
and others have diligently conducted research, finding that<br>
humic acid released from carbon black is contained into ink at a<br>
predetermined quantity to increase the ink viscosity on water<br>
evaporation, by which the carbon black undergoes a quick<br>
aggregation on a recording medium to form an image, thereby<br>
providing a high image density.<br>
It has been found that a pH buffering agent is formulated<br>
into ink, thereby making it possible to retain the storage<br>
stability thereof, although a humic acid-containing recording ink<br>
tends to decrease in pH with the lapse of time.<br>
Further, in recent years, it has been desired that since<br>
inkjet printing does not require plate-making procedures to<br>
attain an easy printing and water-based ink is lower in<br>
environmental impact, such ink is used to make a high-quality<br>
printing for commercial use such as offset printing and gravure<br>
printing. Since paper used in offset printing and gravure<br>
printing is coated with inorganic pigments such as calcium<br>
carbonate and kaoline or not provided with a water absorbing<br>
layer as provided on paper exclusively used for inkjet printing,<br>
it is inferior in absorption of water-based ink. It has been<br>
found that in the recording ink of the present invention, a<br><br>
coloring material undergoes a quick aggregation on a recording<br>
medium to effect drying, thus making it possible to make a<br>
high-quality recording on the recording medium poor in<br>
absorption of the water-based ink.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The recording ink of the present invention contains at<br>
least water, a water-soluble organic solvent, a surfactant and<br>
carbon black having a hydrophilic group on the surface, and also<br>
contains other components, if necessary.<br>
The concentration of humic acid released in an aqueous<br>
dispersion containing 20% by mass of carbon black recovered<br>
from the recording ink is from 5.0 to 20.0 in terms of a<br>
maximum absorbance measured at a wavelength of 230 nm to<br>
260 nm.<br>
The humic acid is an organic acid generated on oxidation<br>
treatment of carbon black, having an aromatic ring and a<br>
plurality of functional groups such as a carboxyl group and a<br>
hydroxyl group. Although the constitution thereof is not<br>
identified, it has been known that the humic acid exhibits a<br>
maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 230 nm to 260 nm. It<br>
is, therefore, possible to determine the concentration of humic<br>
acid by measuring the absorbance.<br>
The humic acid is generated in a process of oxidization of<br>
carbon black, and is removed by washing as much as possible<br>
during dispersion preparation. However, when a highly<br>
oxidized and bulky carbon black is used, it will not be<br>
completely removed by washing, and humic acid is likely to<br><br>
remain in the carbon black.<br>
In a stored ink, residual humic acid is released to reduce<br>
the ink's pH. The reduction of pH may cause aggregation and<br>
thickening of ink, as well as corrosion of members used in the<br>
ink flow paths inside a printer. When printed with such an ink,<br>
the ink may not be normally discharged.<br>
On the other hand, when humic acid is remained in the<br>
carbon black, evaporation of water causes a reduction in the<br>
ink's pH, producing a high image density due to aggregation and<br>
thickening of ink. Therefore, the humic acid preferably<br>
remains at a certain concentration.<br>
The first step of a method for quantification of humic acid<br>
released in an aqueous dispersion containing 20% by mass of<br>
carbon black recovered from the recording ink involves<br>
separation of such additives as a surfactant, rust-preventive<br>
agent and ultraviolet absorbing agent by column<br>
chromatography or the like for recovery of a carbon black. The<br>
thus obtained carbon black is then subjected to vacuum drying<br>
by using a dryer at 50 °C for sufficient evaporation of water and<br>
solvent, and is diluted with water to a concentration of 20% by<br>
mass.<br>
Fifty grams of the diluted solution is measured into in a<br>
beaker, and passed through an ultra-filter (Pellicon Biomax 50<br>
manufactured by Millipore) for 30 minutes to obtain a brown<br>
liquid. This liquid is diluted 10 times with ion exchanged<br><br>
water and read on a spectrophotometer (U3310 manufactured<br>
by Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) equipped with a<br>
quartz cell (light path length, 10 mm) at a wavelength of 230 nm<br>
to 260 nm. The thus obtained maximum absorbance was<br>
increased 10 times to determine the concentration of humic acid.<br>
The thus determined concentration of humic acid is<br>
preferably in a range of 5.0 to 20.0 in terms of maximum<br>
absorbance measured at a wavelength of 230 nm to 260 nm, and<br>
more preferably from 10.0 to 15.0. Where the maximum<br>
absorbance is less than 5.0, there may be found a poor image<br>
density on a recording medium such as a plain paper or a coated<br>
paper. In contrast, where the maximum absorbance is more<br>
than 20.0, there is found a tendency that pH is decreased to a<br>
greater extent with the lapse of time and aggregation or<br>
increase in viscosity takes place after a prolonged storage.<br>
There is also found a tendency that the ink is increased in<br>
viscosity to a greater extent on water evaporation, which may<br>
affect the discharge stability of the ink. In other words, it has<br>
been found that when a certain quantity of humic acid is present<br>
in the ink, a recorded image high in concentration can be<br>
obtained.<br>
This may be due to a fact that solids are quickly increased<br>
in viscosity and undergo aggregation on evaporation of water on<br>
the surface of the recording medium.<br>
A better understanding can be obtained for the<br><br>
relationship between viscosity increasing behaviors on water<br>
evaporation and image density. In other words, if such a<br>
condition is satisfied that when a quantity of water evaporation<br>
relative to a whole mass of ink is in a range of 34 % by mass to<br>
41 % by mass, the viscosity is increased from 5.0 times or more<br>
to less than 550 times with respect to an initial viscosity, the<br>
ink is provided with an excellent discharge stability to increase<br>
the image density of a record.<br>
Regarding a relationship between the concentration of<br>
humic acid in ink and ink viscosity increasing behaviors on<br>
water evaporation, there is found a tendency that the higher the<br>
concentration of humic acid is, that is, the higher the value of<br>
absorbance determined by the above-described method is, to the<br>
higher extent the viscosity associated with water evaporation is<br>
elevated, and the lower the concentration of humic acid is, that<br>
is, the lower the value of absorbance is, to the lower extent the<br>
viscosity associated with water evaporation is elevated.<br>
Further, a quantity of the alkali metal contained in the<br>
ink will also affect ink viscosity increasing behaviors on water<br>
evaporation. The alkali metal contained in ink includes mainly<br>
lithium, sodium and potassium, which are mainly those added as<br>
a neutralizer of a hydrophilic group on the surface of carbon<br>
black and a neutralizer of a resin emulsion, although some of<br>
the alkali metals are derived from a surfactant or other<br>
additives.<br><br>
The quantity of the alkali metal contained in the ink is<br>
preferably from 100 ppm to 1500 ppm and more preferably from<br>
200 ppm to 1200 ppm. Where the quantity of the alkali metal<br>
is less than 100 ppm, the image density tends to decrease, and<br>
where the quantity is more than 1500 ppm, ink may be<br>
deteriorated in storage and discharge performance.<br>
- Carbon black -<br>
Carbon black having a hydrophilic group used in the<br>
recording ink of the present invention is that manufactured by<br>
using known carbon black, including that manufactured, for<br>
example, by a channel method, an oil furnace method, a furnace<br>
method, an acetylene black method, a thermal black method or<br>
the like. It is noted that carbon black made by the channel<br>
method is available only in the limited variations due to a<br>
reduced manufacturing quantity in recent years, and carbon<br>
black made by the furnace method is now widely used due to<br>
availability of wider variations.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the types of carbon<br>
black, and general types of carbon black manufactured by any of<br>
the above-described methods are usable. Preferable are those<br>
in which the primary particle size is from 10 nm to 40 nm, and<br>
the specific surface area determined by BET method is from 50<br>
m2/g to 300 m2/g.<br>

50 mL/100 g to 300 mL/100 g, and more preferably 100 mL/100 g<br><br>
to 300 mL/100 g. The DBP oil absorption can be obtained from<br>
an amount of DBP that is needed to fill voids of 100 g of carbon<br>
black by applying droplets of DBP dibutyl phthalate to the<br>
carbon black for penetration into the voids.<br>

The carbon black can be stably dispersed without using<br><br>
any dispersing agent by modifying the surface, and at least one<br>
type of hydrophilic group is bonded on the surface of the carbon<br>
black directly or through another atomic group.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the above described<br>
method for modifying the surface. Any method may be<br>
appropriately selected, depending on the intended purpose,<br>
including, for example, gas-phase oxidation using an oxidative<br>
gas such as ozone or liquid-phase oxidation using a liquid<br>
oxidizing agent. The liquid oxidizing agent includes hydrogen<br>
peroxide, iodine water, hypochloride, chlorite, nitrate,<br>
permanganate, dichromate and persulfate.<br>
The hydrophilic group includes, for example, COOM, -SO<br>
3M, PO3HM, PO3M2, -SO2NH2 and SO2NHXCOR (in the<br>
formula, M denotes a hydrogen atom, alkali metal, ammonium or<br>
organic ammonium, and R denotes an alkyl group of 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, a phenyl group which may have a substituent<br>
group or a naphthyl group which may have a substituent group.).<br>
In particular preferable are those in which -COOM or -SO3M is<br>
bonded on the surface.<br>
"M" given in the hydrophilic group includes, for example,<br>
lithium, sodium and potassium as an alkali metal. The organic<br>
ammonium includes, for example, mono- or tri-methyl<br>
ammonium, mono- or tri-ethyl ammonium, and mono-or<br>
trimethanol ammonium. In view of obtaining a higher image<br>
density, alkali metals such as potassium and sodium are<br><br>
preferably used.<br>
The volume average particle size in a state that the<br>
carbon black having the hydrophilic group is dispersed in water<br>
is preferably from 60 nm to 200 nm and more preferably from 80<br>
nm to 180 nm. Where the volume average particle size is less<br>
than 60 nm, there is a failure in obtaining a sufficient image<br>
density. Where it is more than 200 nm, clogging may take place<br>
on a nozzle more often, resulting in deterioration of the<br>
discharge performance. In this instance, the volume average<br>
particle size can be measured by using Microtrac UPA<br>
(manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd.).<br>
An amount of the carbon black having the hydrophilic<br>
group is preferably from 5 % by mass to 15 % by mass, and more<br>
preferably from 6 % by mass to 12 % by mass, with respect to<br>
the total mass of the ink. Where the content is less than 5 % by<br>
mass, there may be a failure in obtaining a sufficient image<br>
density. Where it is more than 15 % by mass, ink may be<br>
increased in viscosity to result in deterioration of the discharge<br>
stability.<br>
- Watersoluble organic solvent -<br>
There is no particular restriction on the water-soluble<br>
organic solvent. Any solvent may be used, depending on the<br>
intended purpose, including, for example, polyvalent alcohols<br>

may be used solely or in combination of two or more of them.<br>
Among the above substances, in view of obtaining the<br>
solubility and excellent effects in preventing poor jetting<br>
properties on water evaporation, in particular preferable are<br><br>
glycerin, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol,<br>
1,3-butane diol, 2,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol,<br>
3-methyl-l,3-butane diol, 1,5-pentane diol, tetra-ethylene glycol,<br>
1,6-hexane diol, 3-methyl-l,5-pentane diol, 2methyl-2,4-pentane<br>
diol, polyethylene glycol, l,2,4butane triol, 1,2,6-hexane triol,<br>
thiodiglycol, 2pyrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrolidone, and<br>
N-hydroxy ethyhl-2-pyrolidone.<br>
The amount of the water-soluble organic solvent in the<br>
recording ink is preferably from 15 % by mass to 40 % by mass,<br>
and more preferably from 20 % by mass to 35 % by mass.<br>
Where the content is excessively low, a nozzle may be more<br>
likely to dry, thus resulting in a poor discharge of ink droplets.<br>
Where the content is excessively high, ink viscosity may be<br>
increased to exceed an appropriate range of the viscosity.<br>
- Surfactant -<br>
The surfactant may be used solely by selecting any one of<br>
those consisting of anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants,<br>
nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants and fluorochemical<br>
surfactants or in combination of two or more of them. Among<br>

imidazoline derivatives such as imidazorinium betaine;<br>
dimethylalkyl lauryl betaine, alkylglycine and<br>
alkyldi(aminoethyl) glycine.<br>
The fluorochemical surfactants may preferably include a<br>
compound expressed by any one of the following general<br>
formulae (I) to (III).<br><br><br>
However, in the general formula (I), m denotes an integer<br>
of 0 to 10, and n denotes an integer of 1 to 40.<br><br>

manufactured by Dupont Inc.); Ftop EF-351, 352, 801 and 802<br>
(all of which are manufactured by Jemco Inc.).<br>
- Resin fine particles -<br>
Resin fine particles are allowed to be added to the<br>
recording ink of the present invention. The resin fine particles<br>
are those in which a water-insoluble resin is dispersed in water,<br>
and on evaporation of a solvent, the resin fine particles are<br>
fused to each other to form a film, thereby developing an effect<br>
of fixing a coloring agent on a medium. Further, when the<br>
solvent is deposited, the resin fine particles tend to increase in<br>
viscosity and undergo aggregation, inhibiting the penetration of<br>
coloring compositions to provide a high image density. They are<br>
also effective in preventing strike through.<br>
Resin compositions in the resin fine particles include, for<br>
example, acrylic resin, vinyl acetate resin, styrene-butadiene<br>
resin, vinyl chloride resin, acrylstyrene resin, acryl silicone<br>
resin, butadiene resin, styrene resin, urethane resin, and<br>
acryl-urethane resin.<br>
The resin emulsion is preferably contained from 0.1 % by<br>
mass to 40 % by mass with respect to a whole quantity of ink<br>
and more preferably from 1 % by mass to 25 % by mass. Where<br>
the resin emulsion is contained in a quantity of less than 0.1 %<br><br>
by mass, there may be a failure in obtaining a sufficient fixing<br>
property. Where it is contained in excess of 40 % by mass, the<br>
ink is abundant in solids and scarce in solvents, which may<br>
deteriorate the storage stability or result in frequent drying and<br>
solidification of the ink at a nozzle to decrease the discharge<br>
performance.<br>
The resin fine particles are preferably from 50 nm to 200<br>
nm in volume average particle size and more preferably from 60<br>
nm to 80 nm. Where the volume average particle size is less<br>
than 50nm, the resin emulsion may be increased in viscosity,<br>
thereby causing difficulty in providing the ink viscosity which<br>
can be discharged by an inkjet printer, and where it is in excess<br>
of 200 nm, resin fine particles may be clogged inside the nozzle<br>
of the inkjet printer to result in failure of discharge.<br>
The resin fine particles are preferably added to the carbon<br>
black from 0.05 parts by mass to 1.2 parts by mass with respect<br>
to the carbon black of 1 part by mass, and more preferably from<br>
0.2 parts by mass to 1.0 part by mass. Where the resin fine<br>
particles are added in a quantity of less than 0.05 parts by mass,<br>
there may be a failure in obtaining a sufficient fixing property.<br>
Where they are added in excess of 1.2 parts by mass, the storage<br>
stability may be deteriorated or the discharge performance may<br>
be decreased.<br>
- Penetrating agent -<br>
The penetrating agent includes a diol compound having<br><br>
the carbon number of 7 to 11. Where the carbon number is less<br>
than 7, there is a failure in obtaining a sufficient penetration,<br>
thereby spoiling a recording medium when the medium is<br>
printed on both faces, or there is found an insufficient spread of<br>
ink on the recording medium to result in a poor filling of pixels,<br>
thereby deteriorating the quality of characters or the image<br>
density. Where the carbon number is in excess of 11, the<br>
storage stability may be decreased.<br>
The diol compounds preferably include, for example,<br>
2-ethyl-1,3 hexane diol and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1, 3 pentanediol.<br>
The diol compound is preferably added from 0.1 % by mass<br>
to 20 % by mass and more preferably from 0.5 % by mass to 10 %<br>
by mass. Where the compound is added in an excessively small<br>
quantity, ink is poorly permeated into paper, which may lead to<br>
a case where the paper is rubbed by transfer rollers and<br>
blemished, ink attached on a transfer belt on reversing the<br>
recording face of a recording medium for printing on both faces<br>
thereof may spoil the recording medium, or there may be a<br>
failure in providing a high-speed printing or both-face printing.<br>
In contrast, where the compound is added in an excessively<br>
large quantity, the printing dot diameter is made larger, which<br>
may widen the line of characters or decrease the image<br>
sharpness.<br>
pH buffering agent -<br>
In order to prevent a pH decrease in the ink during a<br><br>
prolonged storage, in the present invention, usable are<br>
conventionally known solutions such as a phosphate buffer<br>
solution, acetate buffer solution, ethanol amine buffer solution,<br>
boric acid buffer solution, citric acid buffer solution, tartaric<br>
acid buffer solution, and Good's buffer solution. Among these<br>
buffer solutions, an organic pH buffering agent selected from<br>
Good's buffer solution is particular preferable.<br>
The Good's buffer solution is zwitter ion amino acids such<br>
as N-substituted taurine and N-substituted glycine, and known<br>
as an organic buffering agent suitable for bio-chemical uses.<br>
The Good's buffer solution has specific structures which<br>
are as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
necessary, which includes, for example, pH adjusting agent,<br>
anti-septic/anti-mildew agent, rust-preventive agent,<br>
anti-oxidizing agent, ultraviolet absorbing agent, oxygen<br>
abosrbent and light stabilizer.<br>
The anti-septic/anti-mildew agent includes, for example,<br>
1,2-benzoisothiazoline-3-on, sodium dehydroacetate, sodium<br>
sorbate, 2-pyridinethioll-sodium oxide, sodium benzoate and<br>
sodium pentachlorophenol.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the pH adjusting<br>
agent, as long as it does not affect ink to be formulated and is<br>
able to retain pH at 7 or higher. Any given substance may be<br>
used, depending on the intended purpose.<br>
The pH adjusting agent includes, for example, amines<br>
such as diethanol amine and triethanol amine,' hydroxides of<br>
alkali metal elements such as lithium hydroxide, sodium<br>

There is no particular restriction on physical properties of<br>
the recording ink of the present invention. The physical<br>
properties may be appropriately selected, depending on the<br>
intended purpose. It is preferable that, for example, the solids<br>
content, viscosity surface tension and pH preferably fall under<br>
the following ranges.<br>
The solids content of the recording ink is preferably in a<br>
range of 5 % by mass to 20 % by mass and more preferably from<br>
6 % by mass to 15 % by mass. Where the solids content is less<br>
than 5 % by mass, there may be a failure in obtaining a<br>
sufficient image density.<br>
In this instance, the solids content of the ink in the<br>
present invention substantially means the water-insoluble<br><br>
coloring agent and resin fine particles.<br>
The viscosity is preferably from 6 mPa*a to 20 mPa*s at<br>
25°C, and more preferably from 6.5 mPa*s to 12 mPa*s. Where<br>
the viscosity exceeds 20 mPa*s, there may be a difficulty in<br>
securing the discharge stability.<br>
The surface tension is preferably in a range of 25 mN/m to<br>
55 mN/m at 20°C. Where the surface tension is less than 25<br>
mN/m, ink may apparently ooze out on a recording medium to<br>
result in a failure of obtaining a stable jetting. Where the<br>
surface tension exceeds 55 mN/m, the ink will not penetrate into<br>
the recording medium sufficiently to result in a prolonged<br>
drying time.<br>
The pH is preferably, for example, from 7 to 10.<br>
A prolonged storage of the recording ink may change the<br>
physical properties. In particular, when the ink is stored after<br>
heating, it undergoes an increase in viscosity and a decrease in<br>
pH. It is desirable to keep the change in physical properties to<br>
the least possible extent. For example, the increase in viscosity<br>
after two-week storage at 60°C is preferably within 5%, and the<br>
decrease in pH is preferably within -5%.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention is favorably<br>
used in various fields and effectively used in an image recording<br>
apparatus (a printer or the like) based on an inkjet recording<br>
system. For example, ink having such a function that paper to<br>
be recorded and the recording ink are heated at temperatures of<br><br>
50°C to 200°C during printing or before or after printing to<br>
promote printing fixing can be used in a printer or the like.<br>
This ink can be in particular preferably used in an ink cartridge,<br>
an ink record, an inkjet recording apparatus and an inkjet<br>
recording method of the present invention.<br><br>
The recording ink of the present invention is able to form<br>
a high-quality image not only on paper exclusively used for<br>
inkjet printing and plain paper but also on coated paper poor in<br>
water absorption. In this instance, the coated paper poor in<br>
water absorption is printing coated paper in which a coating<br>
layer is provided at least on one of two faces of a support and a<br>
quantity of purified water transferred to the recording medium<br>
measured at the contact time of 100 ms by using a dynamic<br>
scanning liquid absorbing system is in a range of 3 mL/m2 to 15<br>
mL/m2.<br>
In the above-described recording medium, a quantity of<br>
the recording ink of the present invention transferred to the<br>
recording medium at the contact time of 100 ms measured by<br>
using a dynamic scanning absorptometer is preferably from 2<br>
mL/m2 to 40 mL/m2, and more preferably from 3 mL/m2 to 30<br>
mL/m2. Further, a quantity of purified water transferred to the<br>
recording medium is preferably from 2 mL/m2 to 45 mL/m2 and<br>
more preferably from 3 mL/m2 to 30 mL/m2.<br>
Where a quantity of the recording ink and that of the<br><br>
purified water transferred at the contact time of 100 ms are<br>
excessively small, beading may take place more frequently.<br>
Where they are excessively great, the ink dot diameter after the<br>
recording may be made smaller than desired.<br>
A quantity of the recording ink of the present invention<br>
transferred to the recording medium at the contact time of 400<br>
ms measured by using a dynamic scanning absorptometer is<br>
from 3 mL/m2 to 50 mL/m2, and preferably from 4 mL/m2 to 40<br>
mL/m2.<br>
Further, a quantity of purified water transferred to the<br>
recording medium is preferably from 3 mL/m2 to 50 mL/m2 and<br>
more preferably from 4 mL/m2 to 40 mL/m2.<br>
Where the quantity transferred at the contact time of 400<br>
ms is excessively small, ink is not sufficiently dried and spur<br>
marks may develop easily. In contrast, where the quantity is<br>
excessively great, bleeds may take place easily and the gloss of<br>
an image portion after drying may be decreased.<br>
In this instance, the dynamic scanning absorptometer<br>
(DSA, Journal of the Japan Technical Association of the Pulp<br>
and Paper Industry, Vol. 48, May 1994, page 88-92, authored by<br>
Mr. Shigenori Kuga is a device capable of exactly measuring an<br>
absorbed quantity in an extremely short time. The dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer is able to read a speed of liquid<br>
absorption directly from the movement of the meniscus in a<br>
capillary tube. A sample is formed into a disk shape, on which<br><br>
an absorption head is scanned helically. An automatic<br>
measurement is realized by a method in which the scanning<br>
speed is allowed to change according to previously established<br>
patterns and one sheet of the sample is used to make<br>
measurements only by the number of points required. A liquid<br>
supply head to paper samples is connected to the capillary tube<br>
via a Teflon (registered trade mark)made tube, and the position<br>
of the meniscus in the capillary tube is automatically read by an<br>
optical sensor. More specifically, the dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer (K350 series D type, manufactured by Kyowa<br>
Seiko Co., Ltd.) is used to measure a quantity of purified water<br>
or ink transferred. Quantities transferred at the contact time<br>
of 100 ms and at the contact time of 400 ms can be determined<br>
by interpolating measurements of the quantities transferred at<br>
adjacent contact times of the respective contact times. The<br>
measurements are made at 23°C and RH of 50%.<br>
- Support -<br>
There is no particular restriction on the support. Any<br>
substance may be selected depending on the intended purpose,<br>
including, for example, paper mainly based on wood fibers or<br>
sheet-like substances such as non-woven fabrics mainly based on<br>
wood fibers and synthetic fibers.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the paper. Any<br>
known paper may be appropriately used depending on the<br>
intended purpose, including, for example, wood pulp and waste<br><br>
paper pulp. The wood pulp includes, for example, broad-leaved<br>
wood bleached kraft pulp (LBKP) and coniferous wood bleached<br>
kraft pulp (NBKP), NBSP, LBSP, GP, and TMP.<br>
Materials of the waste paper pulp include high-quality<br>
white paper, clean envelops, cream-white paper, cards, special<br>
white paper, wood containing white paper, simili paper,<br>
white-color paper, Kent paper, white art paper, special<br>
high-quality paper cuttings, high-quality paper cuttings,<br>
newspapers ad magazines as listed in the table of waste paper<br>
standard specifications issued by the Paper Recycling Promotion<br>
Center. More specifically, the materials include waste paper<br>
and waste paperboard, for example, printer paper used in<br>
information-related fields such as non-coated computer paper,<br>
thermal recording paper and pressure sensitive paper; office<br>
waste paper such as PPC paper; coated paper such as art paper,<br>
coat paper, finely coated paper and matt paper; non-coated<br>
paper such as wood-free paper, colored wood-free paper,<br>
notebook paper, letter paper, package paper, decorative paper,<br>
wood containing paper, paper for gazettes, woody paper, package<br>
paper used in supermarkets and the like, simili paper, machine<br>
glazed paper and milk carton paper; chemical pulp-containing<br>
paper and high-yield pulp containing paper. These materials<br>
may be used solely or in combination of two or more of them.<br>
The waste paper pulp is in general manufactured by a<br>
combination of the following four steps.<br><br>
(1)	Pulping is a step in which a pulper is used to treat<br>
waste paper mechanically and chemically, disintegrating the<br>
paper to give a fiber form, thereby removing printing ink from<br>
fibers.<br>
(2)	Dust removal is a step in which foreign matter<br>
(plastics and others) and waste contained in waste paper are<br>
removed by screening, cleaning and others.<br>
(3)	Ink removal is a step in which printing ink removed<br>
from fibers by using a surfactant is removed from a system by<br>
using a floating method or a washing method.<br>
(4)	Bleaching is a step in which oxidation or reduction is<br>
used to improve the whiteness of fibers.<br>
A mixing ratio of waste paper pulp to a whole pulp content<br>
on mixture of the waste pulp is preferably 40% or less, with<br>
consideration given to measures against a possible curling of<br>
paper after recording.<br>
Internal additives used in the support include, for<br>
example, conventionally known pigments as white pigments.<br>
The white pigments include, for example, white inorganic<br>
pigments such as light calcium carbonate, heavy calcium<br>
carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate,<br>
titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate, satin<br>
white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate,<br>
magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate, and<br><br>
magnesium hydroxide; organic pigments such as styrene-based<br>
plastic pigment, acrylic plastic pigment, polyethylene,<br>
microcapsule, urine resin, and melamine resin. The pigments<br>
may be used solely or in combination of two or more of them.<br>
Internal sizing agents used in making the support include,<br>
for example, a neutral rosin sizing agent used in making<br>
neutralized paper, alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA),<br>
alkylketene dimer (AKD), and a petroleum resin-based sizing<br>
agent. Of these agents, the neutral rosin sizing agent and<br>
alkenyl succinic anhydride are in particular preferable. The<br>
alkylketen dimer can be used in a smaller quantity because of<br>
its higher sizing effect. However, there is a case where the<br>
friction coefficient on the surface of recording paper (medium) is<br>
decreased to result in an easy slippage, the use of which is not<br>
favorable in terms of transferring the paper on inkjet recording.<br>
- Coating layer -<br>
The coating layer contains a pigment and a binder<br>
(binding agent), and also contains a surfactant and other<br>
compositions, if necessary.<br>
Usable as the pigment is an inorganic pigment or a<br>
combination of an inorganic pigment with an organic pigment.<br>
The inorganic pigment includes, for example, kaoline, talc,<br>
heavy calcium carbonate, light calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
sulfite, amorphous silica, titanium white, magnesium carbonate,<br>
titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,<br><br>
magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, and chlorite. Of these<br>
pigments, kaoline is in particular preferable because it is<br>
excellent in gloss development property and able to provide a<br>
texture close to that of paper for offset printing.<br>
The kaoline includes delaminated kaoline, calcinated<br>
kaoline and engineered kaoline by surface modification. When<br>
the gloss development property is taken into account, it is<br>
preferable that kaoline having such a particle size distribution<br>
that the particle size of 2 µm or less is 80 % by mass accounts<br>
for 50 % by mass or more with respect to a total quantity of<br>
kaoline.<br>
The kaoline is preferably added at 50 parts by mass or<br>
more with respect to 100 parts by mass of a total quantity of<br>
pigments on the coating layer. Where the addition is less than<br>
50 parts by mass, there may be a failure in obtaining a<br>
sufficient gloss. There is no particular restriction on the added<br>
quantity. The kaoline is more preferably added at 90 parts by<br>
mass or less in terms of coating suitability, with consideration<br>
given to the fluidity of kaoline and increase in viscosity under a<br>
high sheering force in particular.<br>
The organic pigment includes a water-soluble dispersion,<br>
for example, styrene acryl copolymer particles,<br>
styrenebutadiene copolymer particles, polystyrene particles,<br>
and polyethylene particles. Two or more of the pigments may<br>
be mixed.<br><br>
The organic pigment is added preferably from 2 parts by<br>
mass to 20 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of a<br>
total quantity of pigments on the coating layer. Since the<br>
organic pigment is excellent in gloss development property and<br>
smaller in specific gravity than an inorganic pigment, it is able<br>
to provide a coating layer high in bulk, great in gloss and<br>
favorable in surface covering property. Where it is added at<br>
less than 2 parts by mass, the above-described effects are not<br>
obtained. Where it is added at a quantity exceeding 20 parts by<br>
mass, there is found deterioration in the fluidity of a coating<br>
solution to result in a decreased coating operation, which is not<br>
desirable in terms of cost.<br>
The organic pigment is available in a solid type, a hollow<br>
type, a donut type and other. When the gloss development<br>
property, surface covering property and fluidity of a coating<br>
solution are comprehensively considered, the hollow type having<br>
an average particle size of 0.2 µm to 3.0 µm is preferably<br>
employed, and that having a void percentage of 40% or higher is<br>
more preferably employed.<br>
An aqueous resin is preferably used as the binder.<br>
At least one of a water-soluble resin and an aqueous<br>
dispersible resin may be favorably used as the aqueous resin.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the water-soluble resin, and<br>
any resin may be appropriately selected, depending on the<br>
intended purpose. The resins include, for example, a modified<br><br>
product of polyvinyl alcohols such as polyvinyl alcohol, anion<br>
modified polyvinyl alcohol, cation modified polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
acetal modified polyvinyl alcohol; polyurethane; a modified<br>
product of polyvinyl pyrolidone such as a copolymer of polyvinyl<br>
pyrolidone and polyvinyl pyrolidone with vinyl acetate, a<br>
copolymer of vinyl pyrolidone and dimethyl<br>
amnoethyl/methacrylate, a copolymer of quaternary vinyl<br>
pyrolidone with dimethyl aminoethyl/methcrylate, and a<br>
copolymer of vinyl pyrolidone with methacrylamide propyl tri<br>
methyl ammonium chloride; cellulose such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose; a<br>
modified product of cellulose such as cationic hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose; a synthetic resin such as polyester, polyacryl<br>
acid(ester), melamine resin, and their modified products, and a<br>
copolymer of polyester with polyurethane; poly(meta)acrylic acid,<br>
poly(meta)acrylamide, acidified starch, phosphorylated starch,<br>
internally modified starch, cationic starch, various types of<br>
modified starch, polyethylene oxide, polyacrylic acid soda, and<br>
alginate soda. These resins may be used solely or in<br>
combination of two or more of them.<br>
Of these resins, in view of ink absorption, in particular<br>
preferable are polyvinyl alcohol, cation modified polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, acetal modified polyvinyl alcohol, polyester,<br>
polyurethane, and a copolymer of polyester with polyurethane.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the aqueous<br><br>
dispersible resin. Any resin may be appropriately selected,<br>
depending on the intended purpose, including, for example, poly<br>
vinyl acetate, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, polystyrene,<br>
styrene/(meta) acryl ester copolymer, (meta)acryl ester polymer,<br>
vinyl acetate(meta)acrylic acid(ester) copolymer,<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymer, ethylene/propylene copolymer,<br>
polyvinyl ether, and silicone/acryl copolymer. These resins may<br>
contain a cross-linking agent such as methylolated melamine,<br>
methylolated urea, methylolated hydroxy propylene urea, and<br>
isocyanate and also have a copolymer containing a unit of<br>
N-methylol acrylamide with a self cross-linking property.<br>
These aqueous resins may be used in a plurality.<br>
The aqueous resin is added preferably from 2 parts by<br>
mass to 100 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of<br>
the pigments, and more preferably from 3 parts by mass to 50<br>
parts by mass. The aqueous resin is added in such a quantity<br>
that the recording medium can obtain a desired absorption<br>
property.<br>
Where an aqueous dispersible coloring agent is used as<br>
the coloring agent, it is not always necessary to formulate a<br>
cationic organic compound. There is no particular restriction<br>
on the coloring agent. Any agent may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the intended purpose, including, for example, a<br>
primary to a tertiary amine which reacts with a sulfonic acid<br>
group, a carboxyl group, an amino group or others in a direct<br><br>
dye or an acid dye in water-soluble ink to form an insoluble salt,<br>
monomer, oligomer and polymer of quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Of these substances, the oligomer or the polymer is preferable.<br>
The cationic organic compound includes, for example,<br>
dimethyl amine/epichloruhydrine polycondensate, dimethyl<br>
amine/ammonia/epichloruhydrine condensate, poly (trimethyl<br>
aminoethyl methcrylate/methyl sulfate), diallyl amine<br>
hydrochloride/acrylamide copolymer, poly (diaryl amine<br>
hydrochloride/sulfur dioxde), polyaryl amine hydrochloride, poly<br>
(aryl amine hydrochloride/diaryl amine hydrochloride),<br>
acrylamide/diaryl amine copolymer, polyvinyl amine copolymer,<br>
dicyandiamide, dicyandiamide/ammonium<br>
chloride/urea/formaldehyde condensate, polyalkylene<br>
polyamine/dicyandiamide ammonium salt condensate,<br>
dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, polydiallyl methyl amine<br>
hydrocloride, poly (diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride), poly<br>
(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride/sulfur dioxide), poly<br>
(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride/diallyl amine hydrochloride<br>
derivative), acrylamide/diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride<br>
copolymer, acrylate/acrylamide/diallyl amine hydrochloride<br>
copolymer, ethylene imine derivatives such as polyethylene<br>
imine and acryl amine polymer, and polyethylene imine alkylene<br>
oxide modified products. These substances may be used solely<br>
or in combination of two or more of them.<br>
Of these substances, it is preferable to use in combination<br><br>
of a lowmolecularweight a cationic organic compound such as<br>
dimethyl amine/epichloruhydrine polycondensate or polyallyl<br>
amine hydrochloride with another<br>
relatively-high-molecular-weight cationic organic compound<br>
such as poly (diallydimethyl ammonium chloride). The<br>
combined use makes it possible to improve the image density<br>
and reduce feathering to a greater extent as compared with sole<br>
use.<br>
The cationic organic compound is treated by a colloid<br>
titration method (in which polyvinyl potassium sulfate and<br>
truidine blue are used) to determine a cationic equivalent, which<br>
is preferably in a range of 3 meq/g to 8 meq/g. Where the<br>
cationic equivalent falls in this range, favorable results are<br>
obtained in the above-described range of the drying attachment<br>
quantity.<br>
In this instance, in determining the cationic equivalent by<br>
the colloid titration method, the cationic organic compound is<br>
diluted with distilled water so as to give 0.1 % by mass on a dry<br>
solid basis, without adjustment of pH.<br>
The cationic organic compound is preferably from 0.3 g/m2<br>
to 2.0 g/m2 in drying attachment quantity. Where the cationic<br>
organic compound is less than 0.3 g/m2 in drying attachment<br>
quantity, there may be a failure in sufficiently improving the<br>
image density or effectively decreasing feathering.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the surfactant, and<br><br>
any surfactant may be appropriately selected depending on the<br>
intended purpose, including, for example, an anionic active<br>
agent, a cationic active agent, an amphoteric active agent and a<br>
non-ionic active agent. Of these agents, the non-ionic active<br>
agent is in particular preferable. The surfactant is added, by<br>
which the water resistance of an image can be improved and the<br>
image density is also increased, thus resulting in the<br>
improvement of bleeding.<br>
The non-ionic active agent includes, for example, a higher<br>
alcohol ethylene oxide addition, an alkyl phenol ethylene oxide<br>
addition, a fatty acid ethylene oxide addition, a polyvalent<br>
alcohol fatty acid ester ethylene oxide addition, a higher<br>
aliphatic amine ethylene oxide addition, a fatty acid amide<br>
ethylene oxide addition, an ethylene oxide addition of fat, a poly<br>
propylene glycolethylene oxide addition, a fatty acid ester of<br>
glycerol, a fatty acid ester of pentaerithritol, a fatty acid ester of<br>
sorbitol or sorbitan, a fatty acid ester of sucrose, an alkylether<br>
of polyvalent alcohol and fatty acid amides of alkanol amines.<br>
These substances may be used solely or in combination of two or<br>
more of them.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the polyvalent<br>
alcohol. Any substance may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the intended purpose, including, for example,<br>
glycerol, trimethykik propane, pentaerithritol, sorbitol and<br>
sucrose. Further, an effectively usable ethylene oxide addition<br><br>
is that in which ethylene oxide is partially substituted with<br>
alkylene oxide such as propylene oxide or butylene oxide to an<br>
extent of retaining the water solubility. It is preferably<br>
substituted at 50% or less. HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance)<br>
of the non-ionic active agent is preferably from 4 to 15 and more<br>
preferably from 7 to 13.<br>
The surfactant is added preferably from 0 parts by mass<br>
to 10 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the<br>
cationic organic compound, and more preferably from 0.1 parts<br>
by mass to 1.0 part by mass.<br>
Other compositions may be added to the coating layer,<br>
whenever necessary, to such an extent that will not affect the<br>
object or effect of the present invention. These other<br>
compositions include additives such as alumina powder, a pH<br>
adjusting agent, an anti-sceptic agent and an antioxidizing<br>
agent.<br>
There is no particular restriction on a method for forming<br>
the coating layer, and any appropriate method may be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The<br>
coating layer can be formed by a method in which a<br>
layer-coating solution is impregnated or coated on the support.<br>
There is no particular restriction on a method for impregnating<br>
or coating the layer-coating solution, and any method may be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The<br>
coating can be performed by using various types of coaters such<br><br>
as a conventional size press, a gate roll size press, a film<br>
transfer size press, a blade coater, a rod coater, an air knife<br>
coater, and a curtain coater. In particular, preferable in terms<br>
of cost is a method in which the conventional size press, the gate<br>
roll size press or the film transfer size press mounted on a paper<br>
machine is used to impregnate or attach the coating solution,<br>
thereby giving an on-machine finishing.<br>
There is no particular restriction on an applied amount of<br>
a coating solution for the coating layer. The applied amount<br>
may be appropriately selected depending on the intended<br>
purpose, preferably from 0.5 g/m2 to 20 g/m2, and more<br>
preferably from 1 g/m2 to 15 g/m2 on a dry basis. Where the<br>
applied amount is less than 0.5 g/m2, the ink which is not<br>
sufficiently absorbed may ooze out to blur characters. Where<br>
the applied amount is more than 20 g/m2, the texture is spoiled<br>
for paper to result in a fact that the paper is difficult to fold and<br>
additional writing with a writing instrument is not easy.<br>
The coated film may be dried, whenever necessary, after<br>
the impregnation or coating. There is no particular restriction<br>
on temperatures at which the drying is effected in this instance.<br>
The temperatures may be appropriately selected depending on<br>
the intended purpose and preferably from 100°C to 250°C.<br>
The recording medium may be also provided with a back<br>
layer on the back face of a support and another layer between<br>
the support and the coating layer or between the support and<br><br>
the back layer. Further, a protective layer may be provided on<br>
the coating layer. These layers may be provided in a single<br>
layer or plural layers.<br>
The recording medium may include<br>
commercially-available offset printing coat paper and gravure<br>
printing coat paper, in addition to inkjet recording media, if<br>
their absorption property falls under the above-described range.<br>
The recording medium preferably has basis weight of 50<br>
g/m2 to 250 g/m2, more preferably of from 60 g/m2 to 200 g/m2.<br>
Where the basis weight is less than 50 g/m2, defective transfer<br>
such as a jammed recording medium may take place more often<br>
in the course of transferring the recording medium due to lack of<br>
consistency. In contrast, where the basis weight exceeds 250<br>
g/m2, there may also cause defective transfer in which the<br>
consistency becomes excessively great, thereby the recording<br>
medium is not successfully bent at a curved portion in the<br>
transfer course to result in jamming of a recording medium.<br>
(Ink cartridge)<br>
An ink cartridge of the present invention is to<br>
accommodate the recording ink of the present invention in a<br>
container and also provided with other members and others<br>
appropriately selected, whenever necessary.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the container, which<br>
may be appropriately selected for shape, dimensions, structure,<br>
material or the like, depending on the intended purpose. The<br><br>
container may be, for example, that having an ink bag formed<br>
with an aluminum-laminated film, a resin film or the like.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made for the ink cartridge by<br>
referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. In this instance, FIG. 1 is a<br>
view for illustrating one example of the ink cartridge of the<br>
present invention, and FIG. 2 is a view which also includes a<br>
case (outer covering) of the ink cartridge given in FIG. 1.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the ink cartridge 200 is loaded<br>
into an ink bag 241 from an ink filling port 242 and the ink<br>
filling port 242 is closed by fusion after air is discharged.<br>
When the ink cartridge is used, an ink discharge port 243 made<br>
with a rubber member is punctured with a needle on the<br>
apparatus main body to supply ink to the apparatus.<br>
The ink bag 241 is formed with a package member such as<br>
an aluminum-laminated film devoid of air permeability. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, the ink bag 241 is usually housed into a<br>
plastic-made cartridge case 244 and used so as to be removably<br>
attached to various types of inkjet recording apparatus.<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention is able to<br>
accommodate the recording ink of the present invention and<br>
usable so as to be removably attached to various types of inkjet<br>
recording apparatuses. Further, the ink cartridge is in<br>
particular preferably used so as to be removably attached to an<br>
inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention, which will<br>
be described later.<br><br>
(Inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method)<br>
An inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention is<br>
provided with at least a unit configured to shoot ink and also<br>
provided with other units which can be selected whenever<br>
necessary, for example, a unit to generate stimulation and a unit<br>
to gain control.<br>
An inkjet recording method of the present invention<br>
includes at least an ink shooting step and also includes other<br>
steps which can be selected whenever necessary, for example,<br>
steps of generating stimulation and gaining control.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention can<br>
be employed by the inkjet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention, and the ink shooting step can be favorably carried out<br>
by using the unit configured to shoot ink. The above-described<br>
other steps are also favorably carried out by using the<br>
above-described other units.<br>
- Ink shooting step and unit configured to shoot ink -<br>
The ink shooting step is a step of applying stimulation to<br>
the recording ink of the present invention, thereby shooting the<br>
recording ink from a recording head to record an image on a<br>
recording medium.<br>
The unit configured to shoot ink is a means to apply<br>
stimulation to the recording ink of the present invention,<br>
thereby shooting the recording ink from the head to record an<br>
image on a recording medium.<br><br>
There is no particular restriction on the unit configured to<br>
shoot ink, including, for example, various types of ink<br>
discharging nozzles.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that the liquid<br>
chamber portion, the fluid resistance portion, the diaphragm<br>
and the nozzle member of the inkjet head are at least partially<br>
formed with a material at least containing one of silicon and<br>
nickel.<br>
Further, the inkjet nozzle is preferably 30 µm or less in<br>
nozzle diameter and more preferably from 1µm to 20 µm.<br>
Such a constitution is also preferable that a sub-tank for<br>
supplying ink is provided on the inkjet head and the ink is<br>
supplied to the sub-tank via a supply tube from the ink<br>
cartridge.<br>
The stimulation can be generated, for example, by the<br>
unit to generate stimulation. There is no particular restriction<br>
on such stimulation. Any stimulation may be appropriately<br>
selected depending on the intended purpose, including, for<br>
example, heat (temperature), pressure, vibration, light and the<br>
like. They may be used solely or in combination of two or more<br>
of them. Among other things, heat and pressure are preferably<br>
used.<br>
It is noted that the unit to generate stimulation includes,<br>
for example, a heating device, a pressure device, a piezoelectric<br>
element, a vibration generating device, an ultrasonic generator<br><br>
and a lighting device. More specifically, included are, for<br>
example, a piezcrelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric<br>
element, a thermal actuator which uses an electrothermal<br>
converter such as a heat element to utilize the change in phase<br>
resulting from the film boiling of a liquid, a shape memory alloy<br>
actuator which uses the change in metal phase resulting from<br>
the change in temperature, and an electrostatic actuator which<br>
uses an electrostatic force.<br>
There is no particular restriction on an aspect of shooting<br>
the recording ink, which is different depending on the types of<br>
stimulation. Where the stimulation is, for example, "heat,"<br>
such a method is available that thermal energy corresponding to<br>
a recording signal is applied to the recording ink inside a<br>
recording head, for example, by using a thermal head or the like,<br>
bubbles are generated in the recording ink by the thermal<br>
energy, thereby a pressure coming from these bubbles is utilized<br>
to discharge and jet the recording ink as ink droplets from the<br>
nozzle port of the recording head. Further, where the<br>
stimulation is "pressure," such a method is available that, for<br>
example, voltage is applied to a piezoelectric element attached<br>
to a position which is called a pressure chamber inside an ink<br>
flow path on a recording head, by which the piezoelectric<br>
element is bent to reduce the volume of the pressure chamber,<br>
thus discharging and jetting the recording ink as ink droplets<br>
from the nozzle port of the recording head.<br><br>
The to-be-shot ink droplets of the recording ink are<br>
preferably, for example, from 3 pL to 40 pL in size and, the<br>
discharging/jetting speed is preferably from 5m/s to 20m/s, the<br>
driving frequency is preferably at 1 kHz or more, and a<br>
resolution is preferably at 300 dpi or more.<br>
It is preferable to provide a unit configured to reverse the<br>
recording face of a recording medium so as to print on both faces<br>
thereof. The reversing unit includes, a transfer belt having an<br>
electrostatic force, a unit configured to retain the recording<br>
medium by pneumatic absorption and a combination of transfer<br>
rollers with spurs.<br>
It is preferable to provide an endless transfer belt and a<br>
unit configured to transfer a recording medium while retaining<br>
the recording medium, with the surface of the transfer belt<br>
being electrified. In this instance, it is particularly preferable<br>
to give AC bias of ± 1.2 kV to ± 2.6 kV to an electrification roller,<br>
thereby electrifying the transfer belt.<br>
It is noted that there is no particular restriction on the<br>
unit configured to gain control, as long as it does not restrict the<br>
movement of each of the above-described units. Any unit may<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,<br>
including, for example, devices such as a sequencer, a computer<br>
and the like.<br>
Where ink with a relatively low surface tension is used<br>
such as the recording ink used in the inkjet recording method of<br><br>
the present invention, it is preferable that a nozzle plate is<br>
excellent in water repellency and ink repellency. This is<br>
because the nozzle plate excellent in water repellency and ink<br>
repellency is used, by which even ink low in surface tension can<br>
be used to form the meniscus of ink, resulting in a favorable<br>
formation of ink droplets (granulation). The meniscus is<br>
formed normally, thus there is no chance that ink is pulled<br>
toward one direction on jetting of the ink. As a result, such<br>
images are obtained that jetting of ink and high in dot position<br>
accuracy.<br>
Where printing is made on a medium low in absorption,<br>
for example, a recording medium (sheet) used in the inkjet<br>
recording method of the present invention, whether the position<br>
accuracy is high is remarkably influences the image quality. In<br>
other words, ink is less likely to spread on an absorption-low<br>
medium, there is developed a void, or a portion at which ink<br>
fails in filling the recording medium if the position accuracy is<br>
decreased even to a slight extent. This portion at which ink<br>
fails in filling the medium will eventually cause variance in<br>
image density or decrease in image density to deteriorate the<br>
image quality.<br>
However, the inkjet head used in the present invention is<br>
able to realize a high dot position accuracy even if ink low in<br>
surface tension is used, by which the ink successfully fills a<br>
recording medium which is low in absorption, thus making it<br><br>
possible to provide printed matter with a high image quality free<br>
of variance in image density or decrease in image density.<br>
An explanation will be made for one aspect at which an<br>
inkjet recording method of the present invention is performed by<br>
using an inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention<br>
with reference to the drawings. The inkjet recording apparatus<br>
shown in FIG. 3 is provided with an apparatus main body 101, a<br>
paper feeding tray 102 for feeding sheets loaded on the<br>
apparatus main body 101, a paper discharging tray 103 for<br>
storing an image-recorded (formed) sheet loaded on the<br>
apparatus main body and an ink cartridge loading portion 104.<br>
An operation portion 105 including an operation key and a<br>
display is arranged on the upper face of the ink cartridge<br>
loading portion 104. The ink cartridge loading portion 104 is<br>
provided with an opening/closing front cover 115 for attaching or<br>
detaching an ink cartridge 200.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, inside the apparatus<br>
main body 101, a guide rod 131 and a stay 132 which are guide<br>
members placed laterally on the right and left side plates are<br>
used to retain a carriage 133 so as to slide in a main scanning<br>
direction, and the carriage is moved and scanned by a main<br>
scanning motor (not illustrated) to the direction given by the<br>
arrow in FIG. 5.<br>
The carriage 133 is provided with a recording head 134<br>
made up of four inkjet recording heads for discharging recording<br><br>
ink droplets of individual colors of yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta<br>
(M) and black (B) arranged in such a direction that a plurality of<br>
ink discharging ports are crossed in a main scanning direction,<br>
with the direction of discharging ink droplets faced downward.<br>
The inkjet recording head constituting the recording head<br>
134 is provided with a piezoelectric actuator such as a<br>
piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator which uses an<br>
electrothermal converter such as a heat element to utilize the<br>
change in phase resulting from the film boiling of a liquid, a<br>
shape memory alloy actuator which uses the change in metal<br>
phase resulting from the change in temperature, and an<br>
electrostatic actuator which uses an electrostatic force or the<br>
like as a unit configured to generate energy for discharging<br>
recording ink.<br>
Further, the carriage 133 is equipped with a sub-tank 135<br>
of each color for supplying each ink to the recording head 134.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention is supplied through a<br>
recording ink supply tube (not illustrated) from the ink<br>
cartridge 200 of the present invention filled at ink cartridge<br>
loading portion 104 and refilled to the sub-tank 135.<br>
On the other hand, a paper feeding portion for feeding<br>
sheets 142 placed on the sheet placing portion (pressure plate)<br>
141 of the paper feeding tray 102 is provided with a crescent<br>
gear (paper feeding gear 143) for separating the sheets 142 from<br>
the sheet placing portion 141 and supplying them one by one<br><br>
and a separation pad 144 which is opposed to the paper feeding<br>
gear 143 and made with a material large in friction coefficient.<br>
The separation pad 144 is urged to the paper feeding gear 143.<br>
A transfer portion for transferring the sheets 142 fed from<br>
the paper feeding portion below the recording head 134 is<br>
provided with a transfer belt 151 for electrostatically adsorbing<br>
and transferring the sheets 142, a counter roller 152 for<br>
transferring the sheets 142 sent via a guide 145 from the paper<br>
feeding portion, with the sheets held with respect to the transfer<br>
belt 151, a transfer guide 153 for changing the direction of the<br>
sheets 142 sent above approximately perpendicularly at about<br>
90 degrees to follow on the transfer belt 151, and a leading-end<br>
pressure gear 155 urged to the transfer belt 151 by the presser<br>
member 154. It is also provided with an electrification roller<br>
156, which is a unit configured to electrify the surface of the<br>
transfer belt 151.<br>
The transfer belt 151 is an endless belt, stretched between<br>
a transfer roller 157 and a tension roller 158 and able to rotate<br>
in a belt transfer direction. The transfer belt 151 is provided,<br>
for example, with a surface layer acting as a sheet adhesion face<br>
formed with a resin material of about 40 µm free of rheostatic<br>
control, for example, a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with<br>
ethylene (ETFE) and a back layer (middle resistive layer, ground<br>
layer) which is made with the same material as the surface layer<br>
to which rheostatic control is effected by carbon black. A guide<br><br>
member 161 is provided at the back of the transfer belt 151 so as<br>
to correspond to an imaging area by the recording head 134. It<br>
is noted that a paper discharge portion for discharging the<br>
sheets 142 recorded by the recording head 134 is provided with a<br>
separation nail 171 for separating the sheets 142 from the<br>
transfer belt 151, a paper discharge roller 172 and a paper<br>
discharge gear 173. A paper discharging tray 103 is arranged<br>
below the paper discharge roller 172.<br>
A both-face paper feeding unit 181 is removably attached<br>
to the back face portion of the apparatus main body 101. The<br>
both-face paper feeding unit 181 captures the sheets 142<br>
returned by a reverse rotation of the transfer belt 151 to reverse<br>
the sheets 142, thereby feeding the sheets again between the<br>
counter roller 152 and the transfer belt 151. It is noted that a<br>
manual paper feeding portion 182 is provided on the upper face<br>
of the bothface paper feeding unit 181.<br>
A recording completion signal or a signal of indicating<br>
that the training end of the sheet 142 has arrived at a recording<br>
area, by which recording motions are completed to discharge the<br>
sheet 142 onto the paper discharging tray 103.<br>
Then, when recording ink inside the sub-tank 135 is<br>
detected for the near end of residual quantity, the recording ink<br>
is refilled at a predetermined quantity from the ink cartridge<br>
200 to the sub-tank 135.<br>
In the inkjet recording apparatus, a housing of the ink<br><br>
cartridge 200 can be disassembled to exchange only an ink bag<br>
thereinside when recording ink inside the ink cartridge 200 is<br>
used up. Further, the ink cartridge 200 is able to supply the<br>
recording ink stably, even when constituted so as to fill the ink<br>
vertically from the front face. Therefore, where the ink<br>
cartridge is arranged, with the apparatus main body 101 being<br>
closed above, for example, a case where the ink cartridge is<br>
accommodated inside a rack or an object is placed on the upper<br>
face of the apparatus main body 101, the ink cartridge 200 can<br>
be exchanged easily.<br>
In this instance, an explanation was made by referring to<br>
an example applied to a serial type (shuttle-type) inkjet<br>
recording apparatus at which the carriage scans. The inkjet<br>
recording apparatus of the present invention is also applicable<br>
to a line-type inkjet recording apparatus equipped with a<br>
line-type head.<br>
Further, the inkjet recording apparatus and the inkjet<br>
recording method of the present invention are applicable to<br>
various types of recording by an inkjet recording method, and in<br>
particular preferably applicable, for example, to an inkjet<br>
recording printer, a facsimile device, a copying device, and a<br>
multifunction device of printer/facsimile/copier.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made for an inkjet head.<br>
FIG. 6 is an enlarged view of elements of an inkjet head to<br>
which the present invention is applied. FIG. 7 is an enlarged<br><br>
sectional view in an inter-channel direction for illustrating<br>
major parts of the inkjet head.<br>
The inkjet head is constituted with a frame 10 engraved<br>
so as to form an ink supply port (not illustrated) (ink is supplied<br>
from the surface direction to the rear direction in FIG. 6<br>
(direction of the back face of paper)) and a common liquid<br>
chamber 12, a fluid resistance portion 21, a flow path plate 20<br>
which is engraved so as to form a pressure liquid chamber 22<br>
and provided with a port 23 for communicatively connecting to a<br>
nozzle 31, a nozzle plate 30 which forms the nozzle 31, a<br>
projected portion 61, a diaphragm 60 equipped with a diaphragm<br>
portion 62 and an ink flowing port 63, a laminated piezoelectric<br>
element 50 joined to the diaphragm 60 via a bonding layer 70,<br>
and a base 40 which fixes the laminated piezoelectric element 50.<br>
The base 40 is made with barium titanate-based ceramic and is<br>
joined to the laminated piezoelectric elements 50 which are<br>
arranged in two arrays.<br>
The laminated piezoelectric element 50 is prepared by<br>
alternately laminating a piezoelectric layer 51 of lead zirconate<br>
titanate (PZT) with a thickness of 10 µm to 50 µm/one layer and<br>
an internal electrode layer 52 made with silver/palladium<br>
(AgPd) with a thickness of several µm/one layer. The internal<br>
electrode layer 52 is connected at both ends to an external<br>
electrode 53.<br>
The laminated piezoelectric element 50 is divided into a<br><br>
comb shape by a half-cut dicing process and used as a driving<br>
portion 56 and a supporting portion 57 (non-driving portion) for<br>
each division (refer to FIG. 7).<br>
Of the two external electrodes 53, one of them (connected<br>
to one end of the internal electrode layer 52 in the surface<br>
direction or the rear direction in the drawing (direction on the<br>
back face of paper)) is restricted in length by a process, for<br>
example, notching so as to be divided at the outer end by a<br>
half-cut dicing process, and these divisions are given as a<br>
plurality of individual electrodes 54. The other is not subjected<br>
to division by the dicing process but made conductive and given<br>
as a common electrode 55.<br>
FPC (80) is joined by soldering to the individual<br>
electrodes 54 at the driving portion. Further, the common<br>
electrode 55 is provided with an electrode layer at the edge of<br>
the laminated piezoelectric element and turned around so as to<br>
be joined to the ground electrode of the FPC (80). A driver IC<br>
(not illustrated) is loaded into the FPC (80), thereby controlling<br>
a driving voltage applied to the driving portion 56.<br>
The diaphragm 60 is provided with a thin-film diaphragm<br>
portion 62, an islet projected portion (island portion) 61 joined<br>
to the laminated piezoelectric element 50 which is given as a<br>
driving portion 56 formed at the center of the diaphragm portion<br>
62, a thick-film portion including a beam joined to a supporting<br>
portion (not illustrated), and an opening port which is given as<br><br>
an ink flowing port 63 formed by laminating two layers of Ni<br>
plated film by electro molding method. The diaphragm portion<br>
is 3 µm in thickness and 35 µm in width (one side).<br>
Connection of the islet projected portion 61 of the<br>
diaphragm 60 with the movable portion 56 of the laminated<br>
piezoelectric element 50 and that of the diaphragm 60 with the<br>
frame 10 are made by patterning a bonding layer 70 which<br>
contains a gap material.<br>
The flow path plate 20 is engraved by using a silicon<br>
mono-crystalline substrate to give a fluid resistance portion 21<br>
and a pressure liquid chamber 22 and provided with a through<br>
hole which acts as a communicatively connected port 23 at a<br>
position opposed to a nozzle 31 through patterning by an etching<br>
process.<br>
A remaining portion after the etching is given as a<br>
partition wall 24 of the pressure liquid chamber 22. In this<br>
instance, the head is provided with a portion which is made<br>
narrow in etching width, and the portion is given as the fluid<br>
resistance portion 21.<br>
The nozzle plate 30 is made with a metal material, for<br>
example, Ni plated film by an electro-molding process and<br>
provided with many nozzles 31, that is, fine discharging ports<br>
for shooting ink droplets. This nozzle 31 is formed in a horn<br>
shape (approximately cylindrical shape or trapezoidal<br>
cylindrical shape) as an internal shape (inner shape). Further,<br><br>
the nozzle 31 is from 20 µm to 35 µm in diameter at the outlet of<br>
ink droplets. The nozzles are to give 150 dpi at each array.<br>
The nozzle plate 30 is provided on the ink discharging<br>
face (front face of the nozzle) with an ink repellent layer 90. A<br>
water repellent film prepared by PTFE-Ni eutectoid plating,<br>
electro-coating of a fluorine resin, vapor-deposition coating of a<br>
vaporizing fluorine resin (for example, fluoridated pitch), baking<br>
of a silicone-based resin or a fluorine-based resin after coating<br>
of a solvent or the like, is formed, depending on physical<br>
properties of ink, so that the shape of ink droplets and shooting<br>
properties can be stabilized to obtain a high-quality image.<br><br>
- Surface roughness -<br>
An ink repellent layer used in the present invention is<br>
preferably 0.2 µm or less in surface roughness of Ra. The<br>
surface roughness of Ra is made to be 0.2 µm or less, by which<br>
the remainder after wiping can be reduced.<br>
FIG. 8 and FIG. 9A through FIG. 9C are sectional views<br>
for illustrating a nozzle plate of the inkjet head used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is preferable that the nozzle<br>
plate 32 of the inkjet head is made by Ni electro-casting, the<br>
surface of which is provided with an ink repellent film 31 or a<br>
silicone resin film with a thickness of 1Å (0.1 nm) or more, and<br>
the surface roughness is made to be Ra = 0.2 µm or less.<br><br>
Further, the ink repellent film 31 is preferably 0.1pm or more in<br>
thickness and more preferably 0.5 µm or more.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 9C, when ink 3 is filled, the<br>
meniscus (liquid level) P resulting from a silicone resin film is<br>
formed on the border between the ink repellent film 31 and the<br>
nozzle plate 32.<br>
An ink repellent film formed on a nozzle plate having an<br>
ink discharging opening (nozzle) of the inkjet head is formed so<br>
as to have an opening along with the ink discharging opening,<br>
and the opening is formed so that the cross-sectional area on the<br>
flat face perpendicular to the center line of the opening becomes<br>
gradually larger as the distance from the face of the nozzle plate<br>
increases in the vicinity of the opening.<br>
The shape of the ink repellent film in the vicinity of the<br>
opening is preferably in a curved face. Further, the curvature<br>
radius of the curve in the vicinity of the opening of an ink<br>
repellent film at the cross section of a flat face including the<br>
center line of the opening is preferably greater than the<br>
thickness of the ink repellent film.<br>
Further, it is preferable that a curve from the brim of the<br>
opening of the ink repellent film at the cross section on a flat<br>
face including the center line of the opening to the vicinity of<br>
the opening is approximately an arc curve and the curvature<br>
radius of the arc is greater than the thickness of the ink<br>
repellent film.<br><br>
It is also preferable that a tangent line passing through<br>
the brim of the opening of the ink repellent film at the cross<br>
section of the flat face including the center line of the opening<br>
forms an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the surface of the<br>
nozzle member including the edge thereof.<br>
The opening of the nozzle plate 32 is formed in such a way<br>
that the cross section of the flat face perpendicular to the center<br>
line indicated by the single dot and dash line in FIG. 9 A<br>
through FIG. 9C is approximately circular at the center of the<br>
center line. Further, the ink repellent film 31 formed on an ink<br>
discharging face of the nozzle plate 32 is formed so that the<br>
cross-sectional area of the opening of the flat face perpendicular<br>
to the center line becomes larger as it moves away from the<br>
nozzle plate 32.<br>
More specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, the opening of<br>
the ink repellent film 31 is provided with a curve from the brim<br>
of the opening of the nozzle plate 32 to the vicinity of the<br>
opening, which is given a round shape with a curvature radius of<br>
r. The curvature radius of r is preferably greater than the<br>
thickness of d except for the vicinity of the opening of the ink<br>
repellent film 31.<br>
The thickness of d is a thickness at parts other than the<br>
round part which is the opening of the ink repellent film 31 and<br>
may be preferably a maximum thickness of the ink repellent<br>
film.<br><br>
As described above, the opening of the ink repellent film<br>
31 connected to the opening of the nozzle plate 32 is shaped to<br>
be free of approximately sharp edges (a smooth curve free of<br>
acuminate portions) and given a curve free of catching portions,<br>
thereby making it possible to remove such a defect where a<br>
wiper made with a material, for example, rubber, is used to wipe,<br>
sharp portions are caught by the wiper and the ink repellent<br>
film 31 is detached from the nozzle plate 32.<br>
Further, as illustrated in FIG. 9B, it is preferable that a<br>
tangent line passing through the brim of the opening of the ink<br>
repellent film 31 at the cross section of the flat face including<br>
the center line of the opening of the nozzle plate 32 forms an<br>
angle 0 of less than 90 degrees with respect to the surface of the<br>
nozzle plate 32 including the brim of the opening of the nozzle<br>
plate 32 connected to the brim of the opening.<br>
Since an angle of 9 which a tangent line at the brim of the<br>
opening of the ink repellent film 31 forms with the surface of the<br>
nozzle plate is less than 90 degrees, as illustrated in FIG. 9C,<br>
the meniscus (liquid level) P is stably formed at a border<br>
between the ink repellent film 31 and the nozzle plate 32.<br>
Therefore, such a possibility can be greatly reduced that the<br>
meniscus P is formed at other portions. As a result, a<br>
meniscus-forming face is made stable, by which ink can be jetted<br>
stably and favorably when an image is formed by using an image<br>
forming apparatus in which an inkjet head including the nozzle<br><br>
plate 32 is used.<br>
The silicone resin used in the present embodiment is<br>
preferably a liquid silicone resin which cures at room<br>
temperature and more preferably that involved in hydrolysis<br>
reaction. SR 2411 manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd.<br>
was used in the examples to be described later.<br>
Table A below shows the results of evaluation made for the<br>
shape of the nozzle plate 32 from the brim of the opening to the<br>
vicinity of the brim of the opening on the ink repellent film 31 at<br>
the inkjet head of the present embodiment, ink retained around<br>
the nozzle, edge detachment, and jetting stability.<br><br>
The results of Table A reveal that where approximately<br>
sharp edges are included in the edge portion of the ink repellent<br>
film 31 (near the brim of the opening), ink is retained around<br>
the nozzle, and the edge is detached when the ink is wiped.<br>
There is found no ink retained where the ink head has<br>
round shape, i.e. no shape edge. However, a partial edge<br>
detachment is found, where r is smaller than d as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 10A. Where 9 is greater than 90 degrees as illustrated in<br><br>
FIG. 10B, ink droplets are unstably jetted.<br>
Further, where r is smaller than d and 6 is greater than<br>
90 degrees as illustrated in FIG. 10C, there are cases where the<br>
meniscus (liquid level) P is formed at a border between the ink<br>
repellent film 31 and the nozzle plate 32 on ink filling, and<br>
where the meniscus Q is formed at a projected portion toward<br>
the center of the opening on the ink repellent film 31' (a portion<br>
at which the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the center<br>
line of the opening is made smallest). As a result, there may be<br>
found a variance in jetting stability of ink when an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus equipped with an inkjet head including the<br>
nozzle plate 32 is used to record images.<br>
Next, an explanation will be made for a method for<br>
producing a nozzle member of the inkjet head related to the<br>
present embodiment.<br>
FIG. 11 is a view for illustrating a constitution in which a<br>
silicone resin is coated by using a dispenser 34 related to the<br>
present embodiment to form the ink repellent film 31.<br>
A dispenser 4 is arranged for coating a silicone solution on<br>
the ink discharging face of the nozzle 32 prepared by Ni<br>
electro-casting, and the dispenser 4 is scanned while silicone is<br>
discharged from the leading end of a needle 35 in such a way<br>
that the nozzle plate 32 is kept away from the leading end of the<br>
needle 35 at a predetermined distance, by which a silicone resin<br>
film can be formed selectively on the ink discharging face of the<br><br>
nozzle plate 32, as illustrated in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9A through<br>
FIG. 9C.<br>
The silicone resin used in the present embodiment was a<br>
silicone resin which cures at room temperature, that is, SR 2411<br>
(Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd., viscosity: 10 mPa•s). However,<br>
there was found some silicone entered around the nozzle port<br>
and the back face of the nozzle plate. The thus selectively<br>
formed silicone resin film was 1.2 µm in thickness and 0.18 µm<br>
in surface roughness (Ra).<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 12A, a coating hole at the leading<br>
end of the needle 35 related to the present embodiment is<br>
secured to be wide only by the width to be coated on the nozzle<br>
plate 32, which is a target to be coated. This fact makes it<br>
possible to completely coat all over the target to be coated by<br>
scanning the dispenser 34 only once toward the coating<br>
direction.<br>
In other words, a scanning direction for coating motions<br>
can be set only in one direction, thereby eliminating the<br>
necessity for changing the direction or conducting a reverse<br>
scanning as in FIG. 12B.<br>
In this instance, as illustrated in FIG. 12B, the leading<br>
end of a general-type needle 35 is much narrower than the width<br>
to be coated on the nozzle plate 32, which is a target to be<br>
coated. Therefore, in order to completely coat all over the<br>
target to be coated, it is necessary to move the target by<br><br>
changing the scanning direction for coating motions by 90<br>
degrees or conducting a reverse scanning in several different<br>
directions, thus making it difficult to coat all over the target to<br>
be coated at a uniform thickness.<br>
According to the present embodiment, a coating hole at<br>
the leading end of the needle 35 is secured to be wide only by<br>
the width to be coated on the nozzle plate 32, which is a target<br>
to be coated. Thereby, the target to be coated can be coated all<br>
over at a uniform thickness to provide an accurate surface<br>
finishing.<br>
FIG. 13 is a view for illustrating coating motions when<br>
the dispenser 34 of the present embodiment is used. Although<br>
similar in basic constitution as in FIG. 11, silicone is coated<br>
while a gas 36 is jetting from a nozzle port (opening) of the<br>
nozzle plate 32. The gas 36 may include any type of gas which<br>
is less likely to cause chemical reactions with silicone to be<br>
coated. For example, air may be used.<br>
The gas 36 is coated while being jetted from the nozzle<br>
port, thereby making it possible to form a silicone resin film<br>
only on the surface of the nozzle except for the nozzle port of the<br>
nozzle plate 32.<br>
Further, as described above, the gas 36 is not jetted but a<br>
similar silicone resin is used to coat, thereby the silicone resin<br>
is allowed to enter into a predetermined depth. Thereafter, the<br>
gas 36 is jetted from the nozzle 32, thus making it possible to<br><br>
form an ink repellent layer of the silicone resin up to a desired<br>
depth on the inner wall of the nozzle (for example, about several<br>
µm), as illustrated in FIG. 14. In other words, besides the ink<br>
repellent film 31 on the ink discharging face, it is possible to<br>
form quite a thin ink repellent film 31a (ink repellent film on<br>
the inner wall of the opening) up to a predetermined depth from<br>
the brim of the opening on the nozzle plate 32.<br>
The thus prepared ink repellent film 31 of the nozzle plate<br>
was wiped by using EPDM rubber (rubber hardness of 50<br>
degrees). As a result, after the ink repellent film 31 of the<br>
nozzle plate was wiped 1000 times, it was able to retain<br>
favorable ink repellency. Further, a nozzle member on which<br>
the ink repellent film was formed, was submerged into ink at<br>
70°C for 14 days. As a result, ink repellency was successfully<br>
retained, which remained unchanged thereafter.<br>
FIG. 15 is a view for illustrating one example of the inkjet<br>
head of the present invention and also a state at which the<br>
nozzle port is formed by excimer laser machining. The nozzle<br>
plate 43 is such that in which a resin member 121 is joined with<br>
a highly rigid member 125 with a thermoplastic adhesive agent<br>
126. The resin member 121 is prepared by sequentially<br>
laminating a SiO2 thin film layer 122 and a fluorine-based water<br>
repellent layer 123 on the surface thereof. The resin member<br>
121 is provided with a nozzle port 44 having a predetermined<br>
diameter, and the highly rigid member 125 is provided with a<br><br>
port 127 which is communicatively connected to the nozzle port<br>
44. The SiO2 thin film layer 122 is formed by a method which<br>
is relatively low in thermal consumption, that is, in which the<br>
film can be formed in a temperature range where the resin<br>
member is not thermally influenced. More specifically,<br>
preferable are sputtering ion beam enhanced deposition, ion<br>
plating, CVD (chemical vapor deposition), PCVD (plasma<br>
chemical vapor deposition) and others.<br>
It is desirable in terms of the processing time and<br>
material cost to make the SiO2 thin film layer 122 as thin as<br>
possible to such an extent as to secure adhesion. Where the<br>
layer is excessively thick, there may be found a problem in<br>
processing a nozzle port by excimer laser. In other words, even<br>
where the resin member 121 is neatly machined into a nozzle<br>
port shape, a part of the SiO2 thin film layer 122 is not<br>
satisfactorily treated, with some of the layer not being treated.<br>
Therefore, specifically, when consideration is given to a fact that<br>
adhesion is secured and no SiO2 thin film layer 122 is left<br>
untreated on treatment by the excimer laser, the thickness is<br>
preferably in a range of 1 Å to 300 A (0.1 nm to 30 nm) and more<br>
preferably from 10 Å to 100 Å (1 nm to 10 nm). Experimental<br><br>
results revealed that the thickness of the SiO2 thin film of 30 Å<br>
(3 nm) yielded a sufficient adhesion and no problem was found<br>
at all in relation to excimer laser machining. Further, the SiO2<br>
thin film layer 122 was left untreated only to a slight extent at<br><br>
300 Å (30 nm) and still usable. Where the thickness exceeded<br>
300 Å (30 nm), a relatively large part of the film layer was left<br>
untreated and the nozzle was deformed to an unusable extent.<br>
The ink repellent layer may be made with any material,<br>
as long as it is able to repel ink. Specifically, included are<br>
fluorine-based water-repellent materials and silicone-based<br>
water repellent materials.<br>
Various materials are known as fluorine-based water<br>
repellent materials. In this instance, a mixture of perfluoro<br>
polyoxetane with modified perfluoro polyoxetane (product name:<br>
Optool DSX, manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd.) is<br>
deposited to give a thickness of 1 Å to 30 Å (0.1 nm to 3 nm),<br>
thereby obtaining a necessary water repellency. Experimental<br>
results revealed that there was no difference in water repellency<br>
and wiping resistance when the thickness of Optool DSX was 10<br>
Å, 20 Å or 30 Å. Thus, with the cost taken into account, the<br>
thickness is preferably from 1 Å to 20 Å (0.1 nm to 2 nm).<br>
However, some of ink to be used may be kept for performance for<br>
a longer time when a water repellent film is made thicker in<br>
view of reliability. In this instance, the thickness is preferably<br>
from 100 Å to 200 Å (10 nm to 20 nm). Further, an adhesive<br>
tape 124 prepared by coating an adhesive material on a<br>
resin-made film is pasted on the surface of the fluorine-based<br>
water repellent layer 123, thereby giving a supplementary<br>
function on treatment by an excimer laser. Silicone-based<br><br>
water repellent materials are also usable.<br>
The silicone-based water repellent materials include a<br>
silicone resin and an elastomer which can cure at room<br>
temperature. They are preferably coated on the surface of a<br>
base material and subjected to polymerization and curing when<br>
allowed to stand at room temperature in the atmosphere,<br>
thereby forming an ink repellent film.<br>
The above-described silicone-based water repellent<br>
material is a heat-curable liquid silicone resin or elastomer.<br>
The material may be such that which is coated on the surface of<br>
a base material and cured after heat treatment, thereby forming<br>
an ink repellent film.<br>
The silicone-based water repellent material may be an<br>
ultraviolet-ray curable liquid silicone resin or elastomer, which<br>
is coated on the surface of a base material and cured on<br>
exposure to ultraviolet rays, thereby forming an ink repellent<br>
film.<br>
The silicone-based water repellent material is preferably<br>
1000 cp (centipoise) or less in viscosity.<br>
FIG. 16 is a view for illustrating a constitution of the<br>
excimer laser machine used in machining the nozzle port.<br>
Excimer laser beam 82 emitted from a laser oscillator 81<br>
is reflected by mirrors 83, 85, 88, and led to a processing table<br>
90. A beam expander 84, a mask 86, a field lens 87 and an<br>
image forming optical system 89 are provided at predetermined<br><br>
positions on a light path until the laser beam 82 arrives at the<br>
processing table 90 so that an optimal beam can be given to a<br>
work piece. The work piece (nozzle plate) 91 is placed on the<br>
processing table 91 to receive the laser beam. The processing<br>
table 90 is constituted with a known XYZ table or the like and<br>
designed to move the work piece 91, when necessary, and radiate<br>
the laser beam at a desired point. In this instance, the laser<br>
was explained by referring to excimer laser. A laser is usable<br>
in various types as long as it is an ultraviolet-ray laser of a<br>
short wavelength by which ablation processing can be conducted.<br>
FIG. 17A to FIG. 17E are views for graphically<br>
illustrating a step of manufacturing a nozzle plate in a method<br>
for manufacturing the inkjet head of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 17A illustrates a material which is used as a base<br>
material of a nozzle forming member. In this instance, a<br>
polyimide film manufactured by Dupont Inc., for example,<br>
Kapton (product name) film free of particles is used as a resin<br>
film 121. Regarding a general-use polyimide film, particles of<br>
SiO2 (silica) or others are added to the film material in view of<br>
the handling property (lubricating property) in a roll-film<br>
handling apparatus. When a nozzle port is machined by the<br>
excimer laser, particles of SiO2 (silica) are poorly machined by<br>
the excimer laser, thereby resulting in deformation of the nozzle.<br>
For this reason, in the present invention, such a film is used<br>
that the particles of SiO2 (silica) are not added. Further, as a<br><br>
base material of the plate, Upilex, a polyimide film<br>
manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd., may be used. Upilex is<br>
extremely fine in particles and can be used as it is, as a result of<br>
being free from any machining problems.<br>
FIG. 17B is a view for illustrating a step of forming a SiO2<br>
thin film layer 122 on the surface of the resin film 121. The<br>
SiO2 thin film layer 122 is desirably formed by a sputtering<br>
method which is conducted at a vacuum chamber, with the<br><br>
preferable film thickness being in a range from about 1Å to 300Å<br>
(0.1 nm to 30 nm). In this instance, the film is formed from<br>
about 10Å to 100Å (1 nm to 10 nm) in thickness. The<br>
sputtering is effectively conducted by a method in which after Si<br>
is sputtered, the surface of Si is exposed to O2 ion, thereby<br>
forming a SiO2 film, due to a fact that the SiO2 film is improved<br>
in adhesion on the resin film 121 to provide uniform and<br>
compact film, which is more effective in improving the wiping<br>
resistance of water repellent film.<br>
FIG. 17C is a view for illustrating a step of coating a<br>
fluorine-based water repellent 123a. This repellent can be<br>
coated by methods such as spin coating, roller coating, screen<br>
printing and spray coating. A film form method by vacuum<br>
deposition is more effective because of improvement in adhesion<br>
of the water repellent film. Further, the vacuum deposition is<br>
conducted, as it is, at a vacuum chamber after formation of the<br>
SiO2 thin film layer 122 given in FIG. 17B, thereby providing<br><br>
better effects. Conventionally, after formation of the SiO2 thin<br>
film layer 122, a work piece is once taken out from the vacuum<br>
chamber and impurities or the like may attach on the surface,<br>
which may affect the adhesion of the film layer. It is noted that<br>
various types of fluorine-based water repellent materials are<br>
known. In this instance, perfluoro polyoxetane, modified<br>
perfluoro polyoxetane, or a mixture of them is used as a<br>
fluorineamorphous compound, thus making it possible to obtain<br>
water repellency required for ink. The previously described<br>
Optool DSX manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd. is from<br>
time to time called "alcoxysilane terminal modified perfluoropoly<br>
ether."<br>
FIG. 17D is a view for illustrating a step of allowing the<br>
water repellent film after vacuum deposition to stand in the<br>
atmosphere. This step makes it possible that the<br>
fluorine-based water repellent 123a and the SiO2 thin film layer<br>
122 are chemically bonded through water contained in the<br>
atmosphere to form a fluorine-based repellent layer 123.<br>
FIG. 17E is a view for illustrating a step of pasting an<br>
adhesive tape 124. The adhesive tape 124 is pasted on the face<br>
on which the fluorine-based water repellent layer 123 is coated.<br>
The adhesive tape 124 should be pasted so as not to generate<br>
bubbles. There may be a case where a nozzle port formed at a<br>
position where bubbles are present is deteriorated in quality by<br>
attachments on machining due to the presence.<br><br>
FIG. 17F is a view for illustrating a step of machining a<br>
nozzle port 44. In this step, the excimer laser is radiated from<br>
the side of polyimide film 121 to form the nozzle port 44. After<br>
the nozzle port 44 is machined, the adhesive tape 124 is removed<br>
to use the nozzle port. It is noted that an explanation was<br>
omitted for a highly rigid member 125 used in increasing the<br>
rigidity of the nozzle plate 43 given in FIG. 15. This step is<br>
preferably conducted between the step given in FIG. 17D and<br>
that given in FIG. 17E.<br>
FIG. 18 is a view for briefly illustrating an apparatus<br>
used in manufacturing an inkjet head by a method for<br>
manufacturing the inkjet head of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus is that for realizing a method called "meta<br>
mode process" which has been developed by OCLI (Optical<br>
Coating Laboratory Inc., USA) and used in preparing an<br>
anti-reflection film and an anti-fouling film used on a display or<br>
the like. As illustrated in FIG. 18, a Si sputter 202, an O2 ion<br>
gun 203, a Nb sputter 204 and an Optool deposition 205, which<br>
are stations, are arranged at four sites around a drum 210, and<br>
they are all at a vacuum chamber. First, the Si sputter 202 is<br>
used to effect sputtering, and the O2 ion gun 203 is then used to<br>
radiate O2 ions to Si, thereby producing SiO2. Thereafter, the<br>
Nb sputter 204 and the Optool deposition 205 are used to<br>
appropriately deposit Optool DSX. In manufacturing an<br>
anti-reflection film, the necessary number of Nb and SiO2 are<br><br>
overlapped at a predetermined thickness and then deposited.<br>
Since the present invention does not require a function of the<br>
anti-reflection film, it is sufficient to paste SiO2 and Optool DSX,<br>
with one layer each, without using Nb. As described above, this<br>
apparatus makes it possible to vacuum-deposit Optool DSX, as it<br>
is, at a vacuum chamber after formation of the SiO2 thin film<br>
layer 122.<br>
The ink repellent layer is preferably from 5 mN/m to 40<br>
mN/m in critical surface tension and more preferably from 5<br>
mN/m to 30 mN/m. Where the critical surface tension exceeds<br>
30 mN/m, there is found a phenomenon that ink is excessively<br>
wet on a nozzle plate when used for a long time to result in a<br>
bend discharging of the ink or abnormal granulation after a<br>
repeated printing. Where it exceeds 40 mN/m, there is found a<br>
phenomenon that the ink is excessively wet on the nozzle plate<br>
from the beginning to result in a bend discharging of the ink or<br>
abnormal granulation from the beginning.<br>
The ink-repellent materials listed in Table B were<br>
actually coated on an aluminum substrate, heated and dried to<br>
manufacture a nozzle place having an ink repellent layer. An<br>
ink repellent layer was measured for critical surface tension to<br>
obtain the results shown in Table 2.<br>
In this instance, the critical surface tension can be<br>
measured by using the Zisman method. In other words, a liquid,<br>
the surface tension of which is known, is dropped on the ink<br><br>
repellent layer to measure the contact angle of θ, the surface<br>
tension of the liquid is plotted on the x axis and cos θ is plotted<br>
on the y axis, thereby obtaining a line on the downward side<br>
(Zisman Plot). When this line is to give Y = 1 (θ =0), the<br>
surface tension can be calculated as a critical surface tension, Yc<br>
The critical surface tension can be measured also by such<br>
methods as Fowkes method, the Owens and Wendt method and<br>
the Van Oss method.<br>
Further, a nozzle plate having an ink repellent layer was<br>
used to manufacture an inkjet head by a method similar to that<br>
for manufacturing the head. The cyan ink described below was<br>
used and jetted through the inkjet head. A shooting process of<br>
the ink was videotaped and observed to confirm that a normal<br>
granulation took place when either of the nozzle plates was used<br>
and discharge was also stable. The results are shown in Table<br>
B.<br><cyan ink><br>
Copper phthalocyanine pigment-containing polymer fine<br>
particle dispersion of 20.0 % by mass, 3-methyl 1,3-butane diol<br>
of 23.0 % by mass, glycerin of 8.0 % by mass, 2-ethyl-l,3-hexane<br>
diol of 2.0 % by mass, FS-300 (manufactured by Dupont) of 2.5 %<br>
by mass as a fluorochemical surfactant, Proxel LV<br>
(manufactured by Abecia Inc.) of 0.2 % by mass as an<br>
anti-septic/anti-mildew agent, 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol<br>
of 0.5 % by mass and an appropriate quantity of ion exchanged<br><br>
water were added to give 100 % by mass, and, thereafter, the<br>
resultant was filtered through a membrane filter with an<br>
average pore size of 0.8 µm. The cyan ink was prepared by the<br>
above procedures.<br><br>
A frame 10, which is to form an ink supply port and<br>
engraved to give a common liquid chamber 12 in FIG. 6, is<br>
manufactured by resin molding.<br>
In the thus constituted inkjet head, a driving wave<br>
pattern (pulse voltage of 10 V to 50 V) is applied to a driving<br>
portion 56 according to recording signals, by which the driving<br>
portion 56 is displaced toward a direction of lamination, and a<br>
pressure liquid chamber 22 is given pressure via a nozzle plate<br>
30 to result in pressure elevation, thereby ink droplets are<br>
discharged from a nozzle 31.<br>
Thereafter, when ink droplets are completely discharged,<br>
ink pressure inside the pressure liquid chamber 22 is decreased<br>
to develop a negative pressure inside the pressure liquid<br>
chamber 22 due to the inertia of ink flow and electrical<br>
discharge process of the driving pulse. The step is then moved<br>
to an ink filling step. In this instance, ink supplied from an<br>
ink tank flows into a common liquid chamber 12, passing a fluid<br><br>
resistance portion 21 through an ink flowing port 63 from the<br>
common liquid chamber and is filled into the pressure liquid<br>
chamber 22.<br>
The fluid resistance portion 21 is effective in attenuating<br>
the residual pressure oscillation after the discharge but<br>
resistive to refill by utilizing the surface tension. An<br>
appropriate fluid resistance portion is selected, thereby the<br>
residual pressure is attenuated in conformity with the refill<br>
time, making it possible to shorten the time necessary for<br>
moving on to the next ink droplet discharging motion (driving<br>
cycle).<br><br>
An ink recorded matter made by the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus according to the inkjet recording method of the<br>
present invention is provided with an image formed on a<br>
recording medium by using the recording ink of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The ink record matter is high in image quality, free of<br>
oozed ink and excellent in stability with the lapse of time,<br>
therefore, finding favorably a variety of applications as<br>
documents and others in which various types of printing and<br>
imaging are recorded.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, an explanation will be made for examples of<br><br>
the present invention. It should be, however, noted that the<br>
present invention is not restricted by the examples in any way.<br>

water evaporation and an increased viscosity relative to an<br>
initial viscosity were determined by the following formulae.<br>
• (Quantity of water evaporation [%]) = [ (mass of initial ink ) —<br><br>
(mass of ink after water evaporation)] / (mass of initial ink) x<br>
100<br>
• (Increased viscosity relative to initial viscosity) = (viscosity of<br>
