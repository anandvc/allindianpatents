PRIORITY OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Number<br>
60/785,460 that was filed on 24 March 2006, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Provided are compounds that are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases<br>
mediated by deficient levels of glucokinase activity, such as diabetes mellitus, and methods of<br>
preparing such compounds. Also provided are methods of treating diseases and disorders<br>
characterized by underactivation of glucokinase activity or which can be treated by activating<br>
glucokinase, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Diabetes mellitus comprises a group of syndromes characterized by an inability of the<br>
body to produce adequate insulin or to properly use insulin. Most diabetes patients can be classified<br>
clinically as having either insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Nearly all forms of diabetes mellitus result from either a decrease in the<br>
secretion and blood concentration of insulin or a decrease in the response of tissues to insulin (insulin<br>
resistance), often associated with an elevated level of hormones (e.g., glucagon) that act contrary to<br>
insulin. Such abnormalities give rise to changes in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism. The<br>
syndrome's hallmark is hyperglycemia; other complications can include cardiovascular disease,<br>
retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, skin disorders and gastroparesis.<br>
[0004]	Diabetes mellitus affects millions of persons worldwide, including over 18 million in<br>
the United States. It is estimated that IDDM (Type I diabetes), which results from the body's failure<br>
to produce insulin, accounts for 5-10% of the cases of diabetes diagnosed in the United States. The<br>
majority of diabetes patients in the United States are diagnosed with NIDDM (Type II diabetes),.<br>
which results from insulin resistance combined with the inability of the pancreas to secrete sufficient<br>
insulin to overcome such resistance. Type II diabetes occurs in at least 5% of the United States<br>
population, and in 1996 alone NIDDM affected 16 million people (Roman, S. H.; Harris, M. I.,<br>
Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America, 1997, 26.5, 443-474). Impaired glucose<br>
tolerance (1GT), a syndrome characterized by impaired glucose processing that presents symptoms<br>
similar to a mild form of Type II diabetes, is even more prevalent, affecting 35 to 40 million adults in<br>
the United States.<br>
[0005]	Diabetes is most frequently diagnosed either by the presentation of a fasting plasma<br>
glucose of greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL on two occasions, or by an oral glucose tolerance test<br>
(OGTT) with a 2 hour post load value of greater than 200 mg/dL plus classic symptoms such as<br><br>
polydipsia, polyphagia and/or polyuria (The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of<br>
Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Care, 1998, 21, S5-19). In the case of IGT, a fasting plasma glucose of<br>
less than 126 mg/dL but a 2-hour post-oral glucose challenge lever greater than 140 mg/dL is<br>
observed.<br>
[0006]	A primary goal in the treatment of each of these conditions is the reduction and<br>
control of blood glucose levels. The reduction of hyperglycemia in insulin-dependent diabetes<br>
(IDDM) can attenuate the development of many of the attendant complications of IDDM (Diabetes<br>
Control and Complications Trial Research Group, New England J. Med., 1993, 329, 977-986). For<br>
example, tight control of blood glucose levels through intensive insulin therapy can reduce the<br>
development of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy by &gt;50% each in IDDM patients. These<br>
findings, together with the similarity of the pathologies seen in IDDM and NTDDM, suggest that<br>
control of blood glucose levels would produce similar benefits in NIDDM patients (American<br>
Diabetes Association, Diabetes Care, 1998, 21, S88-90), as has been reported (Ohkubo, Y., et al.,<br>
Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995, 28, 103-117).<br>
[0007]	Several methods to treat hyperglycemia have been attempted.   Patients with Type I<br>
diabetes receive insulin. In patients with Type II diabetes, the pancreas secretes insulin, but in<br>
insufficient amounts to overcome the intrinsic insulin resistance of the disease. The administration of<br>
agents such as metformin (De Fronzo, R. A.; Goodman, A. M. N. Engl. J. Med., 1995, 333, 541-549;<br>
Bailey, C. J. Biguanides and NIDDM, Diabetes Care 1992, 15, 773-784) and glitazone (PPAR<br>
agonist class of drugs; Willson, T. M., et al., J. Med Chem. 1996, 39, 665-668) can at least partially<br>
ameliorate insulin resistance, but these agents do not promote insulin secretion. Treatment with<br>
certain sulfonylureas has been shown to promote insulin secretion by affecting an ion channel;<br>
however, the increase in insulin caused by this class of drugs is not glucose dependent or even<br>
glucose sensitive, and such treatment can actually raise the risk of overt hypoglycemia. DPP-IV<br>
inhibitors, such as Januvia, or GLP or a GLP mimetic (such as Exedin), promote cAMP secretion at<br>
the P-cell through an incretin mechanism, and administration of these agents promotes insulin release<br>
in a glucose dependent manner (Vahl, T. P., D'Alessio, D. A., Expert Opinion on Invest. Drugs 2004,<br>
13, 177-188). However, even with these potential treatments, it is difficult to achieve tight control of<br>
blood glucose levels in NIDMM patients in accordance with the guidelines recommended by the<br>
American Diabetes Association. Accordingly, there is significant demand for novel therapeutic<br>
approaches that allow sufficient glycemic control.<br>
[0008]	Possible approaches to glycemic control include enhancing clearance of glucose from<br>
the blood and increasing the rate of glucose storage or utilization. Glucose enters most cells by a<br>
specific transport protein, where it is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate in a reaction<br>
catalyzed by a hexokinase.   Inside the cell, glucose-6-phosphate has one of several fates: it can be<br><br>
broken down by the glycolytic pathway, converted into glycogen or it can be oxidized by the pentose<br>
phosphate pathway.<br>
[0009]	Glucokinase (GK) (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase),- one of the four types of<br>
mammalian hexokinases (hexokinase TV), plays an essential role in blood glucose homeostasis.<br>
Expression of glucokinase is largely localized in the liver and pancreatic p-cells, where several types<br>
of glucokinase are expressed: these types differ in the sequence of the 15 N-terminal amino acids due<br>
to differences in splicing, but their enzymatic properties are virtually identical. Glucokinase is also<br>
expressed in a population of neurons in the hypothalamus.<br>
[0010]	Unlike the enzymatic activities of the other three hexokinases (I, II, III), each of<br>
which becomes saturated at a glucose concentration of below 1 mM, glucokinase has a Km for<br>
glucose of 8 mM, which is close to the physiological glucose level (5 mM). Thus, at lower glucose<br>
levels, glucose is more rapidly utilized in brain, muscle and other peripheral tissues - through<br>
conversion by a hexokinase other than glucokinase - than in the liver. At elevated glucose levels,<br>
such as after a meal or overnutrition (the postprandial glucose level can exceed 10-15 mM),<br>
glucokinase-mediated glucose metabolism in the liver and pancreas is accelerated. Moreover,<br>
hexokinases I, II and III are inhibited by high concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate, lowering<br>
glucose utilization, whereas glucokinase continues to catalyze utilization of glucose even at high<br>
levels of glucose-6-phosphate.<br>
[0011]	In tissues where glucokinase is expressed, it plays an important role in glucose uptake<br>
and utilization: in the p-cell, the glucose-6-phosphate produced is a necessary signal for insulin<br>
release; in the hypothalamus glucose-6-phosphate acts as a satiety signal and might contribute to the<br>
secretion of enteroincretins; and in the liver, where glucose-6-phosphate production by the action of<br>
glucokinase acts as a mechanism for disposal of excessive glucose through storage as glycogen<br>
(Printz, R. L., et al., Annu. Rev. Nutr., 1993, 13, 463-496). Glucokinase-catalyzed glucose<br>
phosphorylation is the rate-limiting reaction for glycolysis in hepatocytes and pancreatic P-cells. In<br>
the liver, glucokinase determines the rates of both glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, and it is<br>
also thought to be essential for the regulation of various glucose-responsive genes (Girard, J., et al.,<br>
Annu. Rev. Nutr., 1997, 17, 325-352). In both liver and pancreatic p-cells, glucokinase is rate<br>
limiting for glucose utilization, and consequently is a major component of the regulation of insulin<br>
secretion from the p-cell and glycogen storage in the liver. The control of insulin secretion and the<br>
control of glycogen storage are deficient in diabetes (DeFronzo, R. A., Diabetes, 1988, 37, 667-687).<br>
[0012]	The theoretical importance of glucokinase in diabetes is supported by studies of<br>
genetic populations and genetic manipulation of animal models of NIDDM. Mutation of glucokinase<br>
to a less active form of the kinase is the cause of the Maturity Onset of Diabetes in the Young<br>
(MODY-2) (Froguel, P., et al., New England J. Med., 1993, 328, 697-702;  Bell, G. I., et al., Annual<br><br>
Rev. of Physiol., 1996, 58, 171-186). Conversely, humans with a glucokinase activation mutation<br>
are less prone to hyperglycemia and have increased insulin secretion in response to a glucose<br>
challenge (Christesen, H. B., et al., Diabetes, 2002, 51, 1240-1246; Gloyn, A. L, et al., Diabetes, .<br>
2003, 52, 2433-2440; Glaser, B., et al., New England J. Med., 1998, 338, 226-230). Also, NIDDM<br>
patients have been reported to have inappropriately low glucokinase activity. Furthermore, over<br>
expression of glucokinase in dietary or genetic animal models of diabetes either prevents,<br>
ameliorates, or reverses the progress of pathological symptoms in the disease (Caro, J. F., et al.,<br>
Hormone &amp; Metabolic Res., 1995, 27, 19-22). For these reasons, compounds that activate<br>
glucokinase have been sought by the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
[0013]	Substituted benzyl carbamoyl, substituted heterobenzyl carbamoyl., substituted phenyl<br>
carbamoyl, and substituted heteroaryl carbamoyl compounds have been disclosed as glucokinase<br>
activators. See, for example, WO 03/000267, WO 03/015774, WO 04/045614, WO 04/046139, WO<br>
05/04480, WO 05/054200, WO 05/054233, WO 05/044801, WO 05/056530, WO 03/080585, WO<br>

[00278]	wherein R4, R6, R11, R12, R13, and R20a are as defined herein.<br>
[00279]	Additional exemplary embodiment of compounds of Formula I include, but are not<br>

[00288]	and substituted forms thereof, wherein L, R3, R4, R11 and R20 are as defined herein,<br>
and each R20 is independent of the other.<br>
[00289]	The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such<br>
compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification<br>
and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures,<br>
racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such isomers, including<br>
diastereomeric mixtures, pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of this<br>
invention. The term "enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-<br>
superimposable mirror images of one another. The term "diastereomer" refers to a pair of optical<br>
isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical<br>
properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities.<br><br>
[00290]	The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms,<br>
and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term "tautomer" or<br>
"tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible by a<br>
low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include<br>
interconversions by migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations.<br>
Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.<br>
[00291]	In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral<br>
atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the<br>
invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a<br>
particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.<br>
[00292]	In addition to compounds of Formula I, the ' invention also includes solvates,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and salts of such compounds.<br>
[00293]	A "solvate" refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and<br>
a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to,<br>
water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolarnine. The term<br>
"hydrate" can also be used to refer to a complex wherein the solvent molecule is water.<br>
[00294]	A "prodrug" is a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or<br>
by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds<br>
wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more amino acid residues, is<br>
covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group<br>
of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are; not limited to the 20<br>
naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes<br>
phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine,<br>
isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine,<br>

alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone<br>
and tert-butylglycine.<br>
[00295]	Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed.   For instance, a free carboxyl<br>
group of a compound of Formula I can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another<br>
example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as<br>
prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester,<br>
hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryldxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in<br>
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996,19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups<br><br>
are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups.<br>
Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl<br>
group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether,<br>
amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described<br>
above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 10.<br>
More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group<br>
such as (C,-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, l-methyl-l-((C1-<br>
C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl,<br>
succinoyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(C1-C4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and -aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-<br>
aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-<br>
amino acids, P(O)(0H)2, -P(O)(O(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of<br>
a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).<br>
[00296]	Free amines . of compounds of Formula I can also be derivatized as amides,<br>
sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties may incorporate groups including, but not<br>
limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prod rug can be formed by<br>
the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-<br>
carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl, wherein R and R' are each independently (C1-C10)alkyl, (C3-C7)cycloalkyl,<br>
or benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural -aminoacyl or natural -aminoacyl-natural -aminoacyl, -<br>

one acidic or basic moiety, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts<br>
in a single compound.<br>
[00299]	If the inventive compound is a base, the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method available in the art, for example, by treatment of the free base with an acidic compound, for<br>
example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid,<br>

[00300]	If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method, for example, by treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base. Examples of<br>
suitable inorganic salts include those formed with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium,<br>

N-methylglucosamine, plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine, ornithine, histidine,<br>
phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.<br>
[00301]	In certain embodiments, the salt of a compound of Formula I is a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the substance or<br>
composition is compatible chemically and/or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a<br>
formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith. A "pharmaceutically acceptable- salt,"<br>
unless otherwise indicated, includes salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the corresponding<br>
free acid or base of the specified compound and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable.<br><br>
[00302]	The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present<br>
invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are<br>
replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass<br>
number usually found in nature..<br>
METABOLITES OF COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I<br>
[00303]	Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of<br>
compounds of Formula I described herein. A "metabolite" is a pharmacologically active product<br>
produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products<br>
may result, for example, from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation,<br>
esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound.<br>
Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds<br>
produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a<br>
period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF GLUOCOKINASE ACTIVATORS<br>
[00304]	Compounds of this invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include<br>
processes analogous to those well known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description<br>
contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as<br>
Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, WI) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those<br>
skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser,<br>
Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der<br>
organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements).<br>
[00305]	Compounds  of Formula I may be prepared   singly or  as compound  libraries<br>
comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of<br>
compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial 'split and mix' approach or by multiple<br>
parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound<br>
library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula t or salts thereof.<br>
[00306]	For illustrative purposes, Schemes A-U show general methods for preparing the<br>
compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of<br>
the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific<br>
starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting<br>
materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction<br>
conditions.  In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be<br><br>
further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled<br>
in the art.<br><br>
[00307]	Scheme A shows a method of preparing compounds (3A) of Formula I wherein R1 is<br>
thiazolyl and L = O or S. To prepare compound (3A), a 2-aminoheterocycle (1) is reacted with<br>
benzoylisothiocyanate to afford a benzoylthiourea intermediate, which is hydrolyzed to the thiourea<br>
(2)- with a base such as, but not limited to, potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as, but not<br>
limited to, ethanol. Alternatively, the aminoheterocycle (1) can be treated with an inorganic or<br>
ammonium isothiocyanate, e.g., Meckler's procedure, in the presence of an acid to afford the thiourea<br>
(2) in one step. Treatment of the thiourea (2) with an a-haloketone R13COCHR12X, wherein X =<br>
OTs, Cl, Br, I, or NR3 (wherein R = C1-C6 alkyl), in a suitable base such as triethylamine, Hunig's<br>
base, DBU, alkali carbonate, sodium hydroxide, etc. and a suitable solvent such as ethanol affords the<br>
thiazole (3A). If the desired -halo ketone R13COCHRI2X is not commercially available, it can be<br>
prepared by various methods known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited<br>
to, bromination of commercially or readily synthesized methyl ketones (Tetrahedron (1970) 5611-<br>
5615; Organic Synthesis (1946) 13-15; Tetrahedron (1990) 2943-2964), diazomethane treatment of<br>
carbonyl chlorides, oxidation of l-chloro-2-alkanols, bromination of silyl enol ethers, or halogenation<br>
of -keto esters followed by decarboxylation.<br><br><br>
[00308]	Scheme B shows an alternative method of preparing a compound of Formula I.<br>
According to Scheme B, hydroxylated heteroaryl halide (5) (if not commercially available) can be<br>
prepared from heteroaryl halide (4) by: 1) ortho metalation with LDA or another suitable base; 2)<br>
conversion of the anion to the boronate by reaction with B(OR)3; and 3) oxidation of the boronate<br>
with a suitable oxidant such as N-methylmorpholine oxide or hydrogen peroxide. The ortho metalated<br>
species can also be quenched with (TMSO)2 to obtain the hydroxylated material (5) directly upon<br>
acidic workup. The hydroxylated heteroaromatic compound (5) can be alkylated with R2X in the<br>
presence of a base such as, but not limited to, cesium carbonate or sodium hydride and in a suitable<br>
solvent such as, but not limited to, DMF to afford compound (6) wherein L is O. Examples of R2X<br>
that may be utilized include substituted 2- and 4-nitrohalobenzenes, substituted 2- and 4-<br>
cyanohalobenzenes, 2-chloro-l-fluorobenzene, halogenated pyridines, halogenated pyrimidines, and<br>
other halogenated heterocycles. Compound (6) can be converted to compound (7) by the method of<br>
Hartwig et al. (for an example of this transformation by analogy see: Organic Letters (2001) 2729-<br>
2732), or by treatment with a Pd catalyst and benzophenone imine, or by heating in the presence of<br>
ammonia (or NH2PG where PG is a protecting group).<br>
[00309]	Compounds of the formulas (6) and (7) wherein L is S can be prepared according to<br>
methods described in Schemes I, J, K, M, N, O, and P.   Compounds of the formulas (6) and (7)<br>
wherein L is CH2 can be prepared according to methods described below in Schemes I, K, M, N, O,<br>
and P. Compounds of formulas (6) and (7) subsequently can be used in Schemes A-H.<br>
[00310]	Compound (7) can be converted to compound (3) of Formula I upon reaction with an<br>
aryl or heteroaryl halide R1X in the presence of a base catalyst or metal (e.g., copper or palladium)<br><br>
catalyst. Alternatively, compound (6) can be converted directly to a compound (3) of Formula I upon<br>
treatment with R1NH2 by base catalysis or by copper or palladium catalysis; i.e., the Buchwald<br>
reaction.<br><br>
(00311]	Scheme C  shows a method  of preparing 2-aminothiazole and 2-bromothiazole<br>
intermediates (8) and (9), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing compounds of Formula<br>
I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme C, -haloketone R13COCHR12X can be treated with<br>
thiourea in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate or triethylamine in an<br>
appropriate solvent such as DMF or ethanol to afford aminothiazole (8). The aminothiazole (8) can<br>
be converted to a diazonium salt intermediate by numerous methods including, but not limited to,<br>
treatment with sodium nitrite in acid or isobutylnitrite. Treatment of the in situ diazonium salt with<br>
Cu(X1)2 (X1 =Cl or Br) or HBr affords the corresponding 2-halothiazole (9). Alternatively, using the<br>
Hantzsch synthetic method, the -haloketone RI3COCHRI2X can be treated first with KSCN, then<br>
with HX wherein X is Cl or Br, to provide the 2-halothiazole (9). The 2-halothtazole compounds (8)<br>
and (9) can be converted into compound (3A) by th.e methods shown in Scheme B.<br><br><br>
[00312]	Scheme D shows a method of preparing 3-aminothiadiazole and 3-bromothiadiazole<br>
intermediates (11) and (12), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing compounds of<br>
Formula I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme D, acylguanidine (10) (Can. J. Chem.,<br>
(1961) 39, 1017-29) can be treated with Lawesson's reagent or similar reagent in an appropriate<br>
solvent such as toluene to afford the corresponding thioamide (EP 0307142). Oxidation of the<br>
thioamide to form 3-amino-1,2,4 thiadiazole (11) can be accomplished with bromine, iodine,<br>
hydrogen peroxide or nitric acid. Cyclization of compound (10) may also be achieved by treatment<br>
with hydroxylamine-O-sulphonic acid in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol in the.<br>
presence of pyridine (EP 0307142). Formation of the diazonium salt of compound (11), followed by<br>
treatment of the in situ diazonium salt with CuBr2, affords the corresponding 3-bromo-l,2,4-<br>
thiadiazole (12) (EP 0307142). The chloro derivative of compound (12) could also be synthesized<br>
through the use of CuCl2. Alternatively, palladium-mediated coupling of the commercially available<br>
3-bromo-5-chloro-l,2,4-thiadiazole (13) with a zinc reagent affords 3-bromo-l,2,4-thiadiazole (12)<br>
(WO 2003/037894). Intermediate thiadiazoles (11) and (12) can be converted into compound (3B) of<br>
Formula I by the methods shown in Scheme B.<br><br><br>
[00313]	Scheme E shows a method of preparing 5-amino-l,2,4-thiadiazole and 5-chloro-l ,2,4-<br>
thiadiazole intermediates (15) and (16), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing<br>
compounds of Formula I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme E, primary amide (14) can be<br>
converted into 5-amino-l,2,4 thiadiazole (15) by heating with KSCN in an appropriate solvent such<br>
as methanol or ethanol (Adv. Heterocycl. Chem., (1982) 32, 285). Formation of the diazonium salt of<br>
compound (15), followed by treatment of the in situ diazonium salt with CuCl2 affords the<br>
corresponding 5-chloro-l,2,4-thiadiazole (16). The corresponding bromo derivative can also be<br>
synthesized through the use of CuBr2. Alternatively, reaction of amidine (17) with perchloromethyl<br>
mercaptan affords 5-chloro-l,2,4-thiadiazole (16) (Bioorg. Med. Chem., (2003) 11, 5529r5537).<br>
Intermediates (15) and (16) can be converted into compound (3C) of Formula I by the methods<br>
shown in Scheme B.<br><br>
[00314]	Scheme F shows a method of preparing 3-amino-l ,2,4-oxadiazole and 3-bromo-l,2,4-<br>
oxadiazole intermediates (19) and (20), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing<br>
compounds of Formula I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme F, cyanamide can be reacted<br>
with an appropriate acylchloride (18) or the corresponding anhydride, and subsequently reacted with<br>
hydroxylamine to afford 3-amino-l,2,4-oxadiazole (19) (Heterocycles, (2002) 57, 811-823).<br>
Formation of the diazonium salt of (19), followed by treatment of the in situ diazonium salt with<br>
CuBr2 affords the corresponding 3-bromo-l,2,4-oxadiazole (20). The chloro derivative could also be<br>
synthesized through the use of CuCl2. Alternatively, alkyl nitrite (21) can be reacted with<br>
dibromoformaldoxime (neat) in the presence of an appropriate base such as sodium bicarbonate to<br>
afford 3-bromo-l ,2,4-oxadiazole (20) (J. Heterocyclic Chem., (1989) 26, 23-24).   The oxadiazole<br><br><br>
intermediates (19) and (20) can be converted into compound (3D) of Formula I by the methods<br>
shown in Scheme B.<br>
[00315]	Scheme G shows a method of preparing 5-amino-l,2,4-oxadiazole and 5-chloro-<br>
1,2,4-oxadiazole intermediates (23) and (24), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing<br>
compounds of Formula I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme G, imidate hydrochloride salt<br>
(22) (made by the Pinner reaction) can be reacted with cyanamide in a suitable solvent such as<br>
methanol or ethanol to afford an intermediate N-cyanoimidate. Cyclization can be achieved by<br>
reacting the N-cyanoimidate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in an appropriate solvent such as<br>
methanol or ethanol in the presence of an appropriate base such as triethylamine, Hunig's base,<br>
pyridine or sodium acetate to afford 5-amino-l,2,4-oxadiazole (23) (J. Org. Chem., (1963) 28, 1861-<br>
21). Formation of the diazonium salt of compound (23), followed by treatment of the in situ<br>
diazonium salt with CuCl2 affords the corresponding 5-chloro-l,2,4-oxadiazole (24). The bromo<br>
derivative could also be synthesized through the use of CuBr2. Alternatively, alkyl nitrile (21) can be<br>
converted into 5-chloro-l,2,4-oxadiazole (24) (WO 95/005368) by reaction with hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride in an appropriate solvent such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of an appropriate<br>
base such as triethylamine, Hunig's base, pyridine or sodium acetate, followed by cyclization to a<br>
1,2,4-oxadiazolone with a bisacylating agent such as ethyl chloroformate, carbonyldiimidazole or<br>
phosgene. In certain embodiments, the cyclization requires the use of a base such as NaOH, NaH or<br>
triethylamine to allow for the formation of the 1,2,4-oxadiazolone. Reaction of the 1,2,4-<br>
oxadiazolone with a dehydrating agent such as POCl3, POBr3 or PCl5 affords the 5-halo-1,2,4-<br>
oxadiazole (24). The oxadiazole intermediates (23) and (24) can be converted into a compound (3E)<br>
of Formula I by the methods shown in Scheme B.<br><br><br>
[00316]	Scheme  H  shows  a method  of preparing 2-aminooxazole and  2-halo-oxazole<br>
intermediates (26) and (27), respectively, which are suitable for use in preparing compounds of<br>
Formula I as shown in Scheme B. According to Scheme H, a-hydroxyketone (25) is reacted with<br>
cyanamide to afford 2-aminooxazole (26) (Aust. J. Chem. (1985), 38, 447-458). Formation of the<br>

(where X = Cl or Br) affords the corresponding 5-halo-l,2,4-thiadiazole (27). Intermediates (26) and<br>
(27) can be converted into compound (3F) of Formula I by the method of Scheme B.<br><br>
[00317]	Scheme 1 shows a method of preparing compound (3G) of Formula I wherein Z is<br>
CR3. According to Scheme I, the halo-substituted heterocycle (28) (prepared by the method of<br>
Scheme A or B) wherein X1 = Cl, Br or I, is first treated with an appropriate amount of methyl<br>
lithium solution to remove exchangeable proton(s), and then transmetalated with an alkyl lithium<br>
reagent such as n-BuLi, sec-butyl or tert-butyl lithium, or a Grignard reagent such as, i-PrMg-halide.<br>
The resulting anion is then quenched with an electrophile to provide compound (3G). Suitable<br>
electrophiles include, but are not limited to: 1) aldehydes, 2) nitriles, 3) N-methoxy-N-methylamides<br>
(Weinreb amides), 4) dialkylsulphides, 5) hexachloroethane, 6) trialkyl boronates, 7) sulphonyl<br>
chlorides,  8) sulfamyl  chlorides,  9) isocyanates,  10) carbon dioxide, (11) alkyl  halides,  (12)<br><br>
trifluoroiodomethane (13) Mander's reagent, and (14) chloroformates. Exemplary compounds of the<br>
present invention which can be prepared according to the method of Scheme I include compounds<br>
(3G) wherein R3 is alkyl, phenylalkyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxylalkyl (from R3Si(CH2)nI), CI, SH, SR',<br>
SOR1, SO2R1, OR1, I, SCH2R', OCH2R', CO2H, CH(OH)-R' and C(=O)R', wherein R' is alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl.<br>
[00318]	Alternatively, the halo-substituted heterocycle (28) can be converted to compound<br>
(3G) wherein R3 is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl or alkynyl, by a metal (e.g., Cu or Pd) mediated<br>
coupling reaction such as, but not limited to, the Negishi reaction, the Suzuki reaction, the<br>
Sonogashira reaction, or the Stille reaction.<br><br>
[00319]	Scheme J shows a method of preparing compounds (3H) of Formula I, wherein Z =<br>
C-SR3 or C-OR3, and Q = O or S, from a halo substituted heterocycle (28). According to Scheme J,<br>
the halo-substituted heterocycle (28), prepared by the method of Scheme A or B, can be converted to<br>
a thiol or alcohol (29) by one of several procedures. According to one method, the halo-substituted<br>
heterocycle (28) is first treated with an appropriate amount of methyl lithium solution to remove<br>
exchangeable proton(s), and then transmetalated with an alkyl lithium reagent such as n-BuLi, sec-<br>
butyl or /erf-butyl lithium, or a Grignard reagent such as, 7-PrMg-halide. The resulting anion is then<br>
quenched with either elemental sulfur or bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide to form the corresponding<br>
mercapto- or hydroxyl-substituted compound (29). Alternatively, the anion can be quenched with<br>
trimethyl borate and oxidized with either hydrogen peroxide (J. Med. Chem. (2004) 3089-3104) or N-<br>
methyl morpholine oxide (Syn. Lett. (1995) 931-932) to afford the phenol (29). As a third synthetic<br>
route, the halide (28) can be converted under Pd-mediated conditions to thiol or phenol (29) utilizing<br>
potassium triisopropylsilanethiolate (Tetrahedron Letters (1994) 3225-3226) or sodium tert-<br>
butyldimethylsiloxide (J. Org. Chem., (2002) 5553-5566). The thiol or phenol (29) can be alkylated<br>
with a variety of electrophiles using standard reaction conditions to provide the corresponding ether<br>
(3H) of Formula I. Suitable electrophiles include, but are not limited to, alkyl halides, benzylic<br>
halides, heteraroyl-CH2X, cycloalkyl halides, Michael acceptors, and activated heteroaryl halides<br>
such as, but not limited to, 2-fluorocyanobenzene, 4-fluorocyanobenzene, 2-fluoronitrobenzene, 4-<br><br>
fluoronitrobenzene, 2-chloro-4-nitropyridine, 2-halopyridine, 2-halopyrimidine, 4-halopyrimidine,<br>
aryl halides and heteroaryl halides.<br>
[00320]	Alternatively, halide (28) can be converted to an alkyl sulfide using Pd-mediated<br>
conditions with appropriately functionalized sulfides. Examples of such sulfides include, but are not<br>
limited to, esters of 3-mercaptopropanoic acid, 3-mercaptopropanenitrile or 2-<br>
(trimethylsilyl)ethanethiol. Sulfides of this type can be deprotected to the thiol and alkylated with a<br>
variety of electrophiles under standard conditions (Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin (1990),<br>
38(10), 2667-75).<br><br>

suitable base such cesium carbonate or sodium hydride either with or without a metal catalyst (e.g.,<br>
Cul) in DMSO or DMF regioselectively affords compound (36). Compound (36) can be converted to<br>

hydride or triethylamine in the presence of a metal catalyst (i.e.; CuI or Pd2dba3) in a suitable solvent<br>
such as DMSO or DMF. The chlorinated product (40) can be converted to compound (41) by the<br>
method of Scheme A or B. Compound (41) can be converted to a 5-substituted compound (3L) of<br>
Formula I by the method of Scheme I or J. Alternatively, the chlorinated 2-aminopyridine (40) can<br>
be converted to a 5-substituted compound (42) by the method of Scheme I or J, and then the<br>
heterocyclyl group R1 can be added to compound (42) by the method of Scheme A or B to provide<br>
compound (3L).<br><br>
[00325]	Scheme O shows a method of preparing a compound (3L) of Formula I wherein G =<br>
CR11, Z = CR3, Y = CR4, and L is O or S. According to Scheme O, reaction of compound (43) with<br>
R2LH (wherein L is O or S) in the presence of a suitable base such cesium carbonate or sodium<br>
hydride either with or without a metal catalyst (i.e.; Pd2dba3 or CuI) in DMSO or DMF affords<br>
compound (44) wherein L is O or S. Alternatively, reaction of compound (43) with R2CH2Zn under<br>
similar conditions affords compound (44) wherein L is CH2. To prepare compound (44) wherein L is<br><br>
C=O, compound (43) can be treated to lithiation conditions as described in Scheme 1, followed by<br>
treatment with R2CO(NMeOMe).<br>
[00326]	The  2-aminopyridine  (44)  is  then  regioselectively  brominated with  a  suitable<br>
brominating agent such as NBS or bromine to provide compound (45). The brominated product (45)<br>
can be converted to compound (46) by the method of Scheme A or B. Compound (46) can be<br>
converted to 5-substituted compounds (3L) of Formula I by the method of Scheme I or J.<br>
Alternatively, the brominated 2-aminopyridine (45) can be converted to a 5-substituted compound<br>
(47) by the method of Scheme I or J, and then the heterocyclyl group R1 can be added to compound<br>
(47) by the method of Scheme A or B to provide compound (3L).<br><br>
[00327]	Scheme P shows an alternative method of preparing a compound (3L) of Formula I<br>
wherein G = CR11, Z - CR3, Y = CR4, and L is O, S or CH2. According to Scheme P, reaction of<br>
compound (48) (which if not commercially available can be made from commercial aminopyridines<br>
by regioselective bromination) in the presence of a suitable base such cesium carbonate or sodium<br>
hydride and with or without a metal catalyst (e.g., Pd2dbaa or CuI) in DMSO or DMF affords<br>
compound (49) by a method such as: ipso replacement (with R6OH or R6SH to provide compound<br>
(49) wherein R3 is OR6 or SR6, respectively); Buchwald ether or thioether formation (with R6OH or<br>
R6SH to provide compound (49) wherein R3 is OR6 or SR6, respectively); a Negishi reaction (with<br>
R3Zn); an aryl or alkyl Suzuki reaction (with R3B(OH)2); a Heck reaction, etc., according to<br>
procedures well known in the literature and further exemplified in the Examples below. The 2-<br>
aminopyridine (49) is then regioselectively brominated with a suitable brominating agent such as<br><br>
NBS or bromine to provide compound (50). The bromininated product (50) can be converted to<br>
compound (51) by the method of Scheme A or B. Compound (51) can be converted to 5-substituted<br>
compounds (3L) of Formula I by Buchwald ether or thioether formation (with R2OH when L = O or<br>
R2SH when L = S), Negishi reactions (with R2CH2Zn when L = CH2), or by lithiation chemistry as<br>
described in Scheme I (when L is C=O) to provide compound (3L). Alternatively, the brominated 2-<br>
aminopyridine (50) can first be converted to compound (52) by the Buchwald, Negishi, or lithiation<br>
chemistry, and compound (52) can be converted to compound (3L) by the method of Scheme A or B.<br><br>
[00328]	Scheme Q shows a method of preparing a compound (3L) of Formula I wherein G =<br>
CR11, Z = CR3, Y = CR4 and L is O. Treatment of compound (53) with R2X in the presence of a<br>
suitable base such as cesium carbonate or sodium hydride, with or without a metal catalyst, affords<br>
compound 54. Examples of R2X that can be utilized include substituted 2- and 4-nitrohalobenzenes,<br>
substituted 2- and 4-cyanohalobenzenes, 2-chloro-l -fluorobenzene, halogenated pyridines,<br>
halogenated pyrimidines, and other halogenated heterocycles. When R2X contains two halogens, the<br>
halogen ortho or para to an electron withdrawing group is selectively displaced in preference to the<br>
meta substituted halogen, and the leaving group potential using sodium hydride as a base is F &gt; C1 &gt;<br>
Br &gt; I. In this way, a bromine-containing compound suitable for further functionalization can be<br>
made. For example using a brominated version of 2-chloro-l-fluorobenzene with 3-hydroxy-2-amino<br>
pyridine affords a brominated version of compound (54). The bromine can be converted to a variety<br>
of functional groups at this stage to form other analogs of compound (54) using palladium mediated<br>
or anion chemistry. Subsequently, compound (54) can be fegioselectively brominated to afford<br>
compound (55).   This compound can be converted to compound (56) by the methods described in<br><br>
Schemes I or J. Compound (56) is then converted to compound (3L) by the procedures found in<br>
Schemes A or B. Alternatively, compound (55) can be converted to compound (57) by the<br>
procedures found in Schemes A or B, and then converted to compound (3L) by the procedures found<br>

is alkylene optionally substituted by one or more alkyl groups (which can be prepared by the method<br>
of Scheme A or B), can be converted to carboxylic acid (62) by reduction or hydrolysis with a<br>
hydride or hydroxide, respectively. Compound (62) can be converted to alcohol (64) upon treatment<br><br>
with a lithium reagent R'Li. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid (62) can be converted to a primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary amide (63) using a variety of amide coupling methods known to those skilled in<br>
the art. Compound (62) can also be converted to compound (65), wherein R9 is a heterocyclyl group<br>
such as, but not limited to, tetrazolyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, or thiazoyl, by coupling methods known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
[00331]	Scheme T describes the preparation of intermediates (68), (72) and (75) and<br>
substituted forms thereof suitable for use in preparing compounds of Formula (3A) wherein R12 and<br>
R13 form a fused heterocyclic ring. To prepare intermediate (68), 2-halo-3-aminopyridine (66) is<br>
reacted with a thiocyanate (for example, sodium or potassium thiocyanate) in acidic media (for<br>
example, acetic acid) to provide thiazolopyridine (67). Compound (67) is converted to the<br>
corresponding 2-halo compound (68) by standard methods (for example, by diazotization of the<br>
amine with NaNO2 and HX3, followed by reaction with Cu(X3)2).<br><br>
[00332]	To prepare intermediate (72), the 2-amino-3-haiopyridazine (69) is reacted with a<br>
protected isothiocyanate to provide protected 2-aminothiazolopyridazine (70), which is deprotected<br>
under standard hydrolytic conditions to provide 2-aminothiazolopyridazine (71) (Koren, B., et al.,<br>
Heterocycles 1987, 26(3), 689-697). The aminohetcrocyclic compound (71) is converted to the<br>
corresponding 2-halo compound (72), for example, as described above.<br>
[00333]	To    prepare    intermediate    (75),    compound    (73)    is    converted    to    the    2-<br>
aminothiazolotriazine (74), for example, using the method of Jacobsen, et al., (Aust. J. Chem. 1987,<br>
40(3), 491-499). The aminoheterocyclic compound (74) is then converted to the corresponding 2-<br>
halo compound (75), for example, as described above.<br>
[00334]	It will be appreciated that the aminoheterocycles (68), (72) and (75) can be further<br>
functionalized if desired, for example by halogenation of the 6-membered ring (for example with<br>
NBS or bromine). Such halogenated derivatives may be further modified using well known methods.<br><br>
[00335]	Scheme U shows an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula (3A)<br>
wherein R12 and R13 form a fused heterocyclic ring. Substituted 2-halo-aminoheterocycles (76),<br>
wherein at least one X = N, but no more than two consecutive X are N, is reacted with thiophosgene<br>
to provide the isothiocyanate (77). Refluxing the isothiocyanate (77) with the 5-brominated<br>
aminopyridine (45) in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or THF affords the heterocycle (78), which<br>
can be converted to compounds of Formula (3A) by the methods described in Scheme P.<br>
Alternatively, the aminopyridine (47), prepared as in Scheme P, is refluxed with the isocyanate (77)<br>
to afford compounds of structure (3A).<br><br><br>
[00336]	Scheme V shows an alternative method for producing compounds of the formula 3C<br>
wherein D2 is N. Formation of oxime (80) -from aldehyde (79) allows for the chlorination with N-<br>
chlorosuccinimide in a suitable solvent, such as DMF, to produce compound (81). Compound (81) is<br>
sulfonylated with a sulfonyl chloride having the formula R'SO2C1 wherein R1 is, Ci-Cg alkyl (for<br>
example, methyl) or aryl optionally substituted with Ci-C$ alkyl (for example, tolyl) in the presence<br>
of a base, such as but not limited to triethylamine, to afford compound (82) (See, for example,<br>
Gibbons, L. US Patent No. 3,983,246). Reaction of compound (82) with a thiocyanate salt, such as<br>
NaNCS, in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, and in the presence of a base, such as but not<br>
limited to pyridine, affords the activated intermediate (83) (see, for example, Takeuchi, K., JP<br>
2001081084). Intermediate (83) can be reacted in situ with an appropriate amino heterocycle (7) to<br>
afford compounds of the structure (3C) of Formula I.<br><br><br>
[00337]	Scheme W shows an alternative method for the construction of compounds of<br>
Formula I where G and Y are CH, Z is C-SR6 or C-OR6, and L is O or S. Starting from the<br>
commercially available 2-cyanopyridine (84), selective nucleophilic displacement can be achieved<br>
with compounds of the formula R2Q1H, where Q1 is O or S, and an appropriate base, such as sodium<br>
hydride, in a suitable solvent, such as DMF to provide compound (85). Addition of a second<br>
nucleophile having the formula R6Q2H, wherein Q2 is O or S, under similar conditions, affords the<br>
functionalized 2-cyanopyridine (86). Hydrolysis of the nitrite can occur under many conditions, with<br>
NaOH in aqueous ethanol being preferred, to afford the picolinate (87). Curtius rearrangement in the<br>
presence of an appropriate alcohol affords the carbamate (88). The carbamate can be removed using<br>
various conditions, depending on the alcohol used in the previous step, to provide the 2-<br>
aminopyridine (89). Using procedures outlined in Schemes A, B or T, compounds (90) of the<br>
Formula I can be synthesized from compound (89).<br>

[00373]	The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the<br>
present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii)<br>
attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or<br>
disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease,<br>
condition, or disorder described herein.      The amount of a compound of Formula I that will<br>
correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound,<br>
disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the mammal in need of treatment, but<br>
can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
[00374]	The terms "treat" and "treatment" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic<br>
or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired<br>
physiological change or disorder. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results<br>
include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized<br>
(i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or<br><br>
palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or<br>
undetectable. "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not<br>
receiving treatment Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder<br>
as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is<br>
to be prevented.<br>

[00383]	COMBINATION THERAPY<br>
[00384]	The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more<br>
additional drugs such as described below. The dose of the second drug can be appropriately selected<br>
based on a clinically employed dose. The proportion of the compound of the present invention and<br>
the second drug can be appropriately determined according to the administration subject, the<br>
administration route, the target disease, the clinical condition, the combination, and other factors. In<br>
cases where the administration subject is a human, for instance, the second drug may be used in an<br>
amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight per part by weight of the compound of the present invention.<br>
[00385]	The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing<br>
regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of this invention such that they do<br>
not adversely affect each other. Such drugs are suitably present in combination in amounts that are<br>
effective for the purpose intended. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
composition comprising a compound of this invention in combination with a second drug, such as<br>
described herein.<br>
[00386]	A compound of this invention and the additional pharmaceutically active agent(s)<br>
may be administered together in a unitary pharmaceutical composition or separately and, when<br><br>
administered separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. Such sequential<br>
administration may be close in time or remote in time. The amounts of the compound of this<br>
invention and the second agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order<br>
to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.<br>
[00387]	The combination therapy may provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e., the<br>
effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that<br>
results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active<br>
ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit<br>
dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by<br>
some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained<br>
when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in<br>
separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active<br>
ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective<br>
dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.<br>
[00388]  The compounds of the present invention can be used, for example, in combination<br>
with additional drug(s) such as a therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus, and/or a therapeutic agent for<br>
diabetic complications, as defined above. Examples of known therapeutic agents for diabetes<br>
mellitus which can be used in combination with a compound of this invention include insulin<br>
preparations (e.g., animal insulin preparations extracted from the bovine or swine pancreas; human<br>
insulin preparations synthesized by a genetic engineering technique using Escherichia coli or a<br>
yeast), a fragment of insulin or derivatives thereof (e.g., INS-1), agents for improving insulin<br>
resistance (e.g., pioglitazone hydrochloride, troglitazone, rosiglitazohe or its maleate, GI-262570,<br>
JTT-501, MCC-555, YM-440, KRP-297, CS-011, FK-614), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g.,<br>
voglibose, acarbose, miglitol, emiglitate), biguanides (e.g., phenformin, metformin, buformin),<br>
insulin secretagogues [sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, chlorpropamide,<br>
tolazamide, acetohexamide, glyclopyramide, glimepiride, giipizide, glybuzole), repaglinide,<br>
nateglinide, mitiglinide or its calcium salt hydrate, GLP-1], dipeptidylpeptidase IV inhibitors (e.g.,<br>
NVP-DPP-278, PT-100), beta-3 agonists (e.g., CL-316243, SR-58611-A, UL-TG-307, SB-226552,<br>
AJ-9677, BMS-196085, AZ-40140, etc.), amylin agonists (e.g., pramlintide), phosphoryrosine<br>
phosphatase inhibitors (e.g., vanadic acid), gluconeogenesis inhibitors (e.g., glycogen phosphorylase<br>
inhibitors, glucose-6-phosphatase inhibitors, glucagon antagonists), SGLT (sodium-glucose<br>
cotransporter) inhibitors (e.g., T-l 095 ), and the like.<br>
[00389]	Examples of known therapeutic agents for diabetic complications include aldose<br>
reductase inhibitors (e.g., tolrestat, epalrestat, zenarestat, zopolrestat, minalrestat, fidarestat (SNK-<br>
860), CT-112), neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF, NT-3, BDNF), neurotrophic factor production<br><br>
secretion promoters, PKC inhibitors (e.g., LY-333531), AGE inhibitors (e.g., ALT946, pimagedine,<br>
pyratoxathine, N-phenacylthiazolium bromide (ALT766), EXO-226), active oxygen scavengers (e.g.,<br>
thioctic acid), and cerebral vasodilators (e.g., tiapuride, mexiletine).<br>
[00390]	The compounds of the present invention can also be used, for example in combination<br>
with antihyperlipidemic agents. Epidemiological evidence has firmly established hyperlipidemia as a<br>
primary risk factor in causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis. In recent years,<br>
emphasis has been placed on lowering plasma cholesterol levels, and low density lipoprotein<br>
cholesterol in particular, as an essential step in prevention of CVD. Cardiovascular disease is<br>
especially prevalent among diabetic subjects, at least in part because of the existence of multiple<br>
independent risk factors in this population. Successful treatment of hyperlipidemia in the general<br>
population, and in diabetic subjects in particular, is therefore of exceptional medical importance.<br>
Examples of antihyperlipidemic agents include, but are not limited to, statin compounds which are<br>
cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (e.g., cerivastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin,<br>
fluvastatin, itavastatin or their salts, etc.), squalene synthase inhibitors or fibrate compounds (e.g.,<br>
bezafibrate, clofibrate, simfibrate, clinofibrate) having a triglyceride lowering action and the like.<br>
[00391]	The  compounds  of the present invention  can also  be .used,  for example,  in<br>
combination with hypotensive agents. Hypertension has been associated with elevated blood insulin<br>
levels, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Insulin, a peptide hormone whose primary actions are<br>
to promote glucose utilization, protein synthesis and the formation and storage of neutral lipids, also<br>
acts to promote vascular cell growth and increase renal sodium retention, among other things. These<br>
latter functions can be accomplished without affecting glucose levels and are known causes of<br>
hypertension. Peripheral vasculature growth, for example, can cause constriction of peripheral<br>
capillaries, while sodium retention increases blood volume. Thus, the lowering of insulin levels in<br>
hyperinsulinemics can prevent abnormal vascular growth and renal sodium retention caused by high<br>
insulin levels and thereby alleviates hypertension. Examples of hypotensive agents include, but are<br>
not limited to, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril, delapril),<br>
angiotensin II antagonists (e.g., candesartan cilexetil, losartan, eprosartan, valsantan, termisartan,<br>
irbesartan, tasosartan), calcium antagonists (e.g., manidipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, amlodipine,<br>
efonidipine), and clonidine.<br>
[00392]	The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with antiobesity<br>
agents. The term "obesity" implies an excess of adipose tissue. Obesity is a well-known risk factor<br>
for the development of many very common diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and<br>
hypertension. To some extent appetite is controlled by discrete areas in the hypothalamus: a feeding<br>
centre in the ventrolateral nucleus of the hypothalamus (VLH) and a satiety centre in the<br>
ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The cerebral cortex receives positive signals from the feeding<br><br>
center that stimulate eating, and the satiety center modulates this process by sending inhibitory<br>
impulses to the feeding center. Several regulatory processes may influence these hypothalamic<br>
centers. The satiety center may be activated by the increases in plasma glucose and/or insulin that<br>
follow a meal. Examples of antiobesity agents include, but are not limited to, antiobesity drugs<br>
acting on the central nervous system (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fenfluramine, phentermine, sibutramine,<br>
anfepramon, dexamphetamine, mazindol, phenylpropanolamine, clobenzorex), pancreatic lipase<br>
inhibitors (e.g. orlistat), beta-3 agonists (e.g., CL-316243, SR-58611-A, UL-TG-307, SB-226552,<br>
AJ-9677, BMS-196085, AZ-40140), anorectic peptides (e.g.; leptin, CNTF (Ciliary Neurotrophic<br>
Factor) and cholecystokinin agonists (e.g. lintitript, FPL-15849).<br>
ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION<br>
[00393]	The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the<br>
condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal,<br>
nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and<br>

Example A<br>
In Vitro Glucokinase Assays<br>
[00869]	The in vitro efficacy of glucokinase activators of the present invention was assessed<br>
in two separate assays: an EC50 assay to evaluate the potency of each compound at a fixed,<br>
physiologically relevant concentration of glucose, and a glucose S0.5 assay at a fixed, near saturating<br>
(if possible) concentration of compound to evaluate its effect on the Vm and S0.5 for glucose. For<br>
each of these assays, glucokinase activity was estimated by monitoring the increase in absorbance at<br>
340 nm in a coupled assay system containing NAD+ and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.<br>
Assays were conducted at 30 °C using a thermostatically controlled absorbance plate reader<br>
(Spectramax 340PC, Molecular Devices Corp.) and clear, 96-well, flat bottom, polystyrene plates<br>
(Costar 3695, Corning). Each 50-L assay mixture contained 10 mM K+MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mM<br>
MgCl2, 50 mM KC1, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2% DMSO, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM NAD+, 5<br>
U/mL glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, approximately 5 nM human glucokinase and (depending<br>
on the assay) varying concentrations of glucose and test compound. The absorbance at 340 nm was<br>
monitored kinetically over a period of 5 minutes (10 s/cycle), and rates were estimated from the<br>
slopes of linear fits to the raw data.<br>
Glucokinase EC50 Assay.<br>
[00870]	For this assay, the glucose concentration was fixed at 5 mM, while the control or test<br>
compound was varied over a 10-point, 3-fold dilution series and typically ranged from a high dose of<br>
50 M to a low dose of approximately 2.5 nM. A standard, four-parameter logistic model (Equation<br>
1) was fit to the raw data (rate versus concentration of compound):<br><br><br><br>
[00871]	where x is the concentration of compound, y is the estimated rate, A and B are the<br>
lower and upper asymptotes, respectively, C is the EC50 and D is the Hill slope. The EC50 is defined<br>
as the midpoint or inflection point between the upper and lower asymptotes.<br>
[00872]	The compounds exemplified herein have been found to have an ECso in the range of 6<br>
and 50,000 nM in the above described assay.   Certain compounds exemplified herein have been<br>
found to have an EC50 in the range of 3nM and 5000 nM.<br>
Glucose S0.5 Assay:<br>
[00873]	For this assay, the concentration of control or test compound was fixed at or near a<br>
saturating concentration, if possible, typically 50 M, while the glucose concentration was varied<br>
over a 10-point, 2-fold dilution series ranging from 80 to approximately 0.16 mM. The same four-<br>
parameter logistic model used for the ECso assay (Equation 1) was employed to estimate the relevant<br>
kinetic parameters. In this assay, the definitions for the variables and parameters are similar except<br>
that x represents the concentration of glucose, B is the rate at saturating glucose (Vm), C is the S0.5 for<br>
glucose (the concentration of glucose at Vm/2) and D is the Hill Coefficient.<br>
[00874]	The compounds exemplified herein have been found to have an S0.5 of between 0.3<br>
and 5 mM in the above described assay.<br>
