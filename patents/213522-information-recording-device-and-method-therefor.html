				<td>An information recording medium contains version information indicating to which version of the recording specification the information recording medium corresponds. Moreover, the medium contains standard recording condition information for recording information at standard speed and high-speed recording condition information for recording information at a higher speed. An information recording device compares the version information on theinformation recording medium to the version information of the information recording device side to judge whether information recording is enabled. When it is judged that information recording is disabled according to the version information, adaptive version information is further compared to the version information of the information recording device side to judge whether information recording is enabled. Accordingly, even when it is judged that information recording is disabled according to the version information alone, if it is judged that recording is enabled by the adaptive version information corresponding to the high-speed recording condition, information can be recorded. Thus, it is possible to correctly judge whether recording is enabled to the information recording medium.</td>

"INFORMATION RECORDING DEVICE AND METHOD THEREFOR"<br>
PIONEER CORPORATION, a company incorporated in Japan having its Registered Office at 4-1, Meguro 1-chome, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8654, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.	GRANTED<br><br>

INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM, INFORMATION RECORDING DEVICE AND METHOD THEREFOR, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT AND STORAGE MEDIUM THEREFOR<br>
5  FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an additionally writable<br>
or rewritable recording medium such as a DVD-R (DVD-Recordable)<br>
and DVD-RW (DVD-Rewritable), as well as an information recording<br>
device and an information recording method for recording<br>
10  information on such the recording medium.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
As an information recording medium onto which information can be additionally written or can be rewritten for a plurality<br>
15 of times, a DVD-R and a DVD-RW are known. On such the information recording medium, information about a recording speed and a recording condition suitable for the information recording medium is recorded. Specifically, part version information of a recording standard defining a recording method suitable for the disc is<br>
20  recorded in a control data zone in a lead-in area of the DVD-R or the DVD-RW. The part version information indicates as to which version of the DVD recording standard the disc is adapted to. Meanwhile, a drive device (information recording device) for recording information on the DVD-R or DVD-RW has version<br>
25 information of the drive device, indicating the version according to which the drive device can record information. When a certain disc is set, the drive device obtains the above-mentioned part version information from the lead-in area of the disc, and compares the part version information with the version information of the<br>
30 drive device. When the version information of the drive device is equal to or higher than the part version information of the disc, the disc is suitable for the information recording by the drive device. On the contrary, when the version information of the drive device is lower than the part version information of<br><br><br>
the disc, the drive device is not suitable for recording information on that disc, and the drive device ejects the disc.<br>
In recent years, the performance of the drive device is improved, and there is demand of a disc which can cope with high 5 speed recording, such as four-times or eight-times higher speed recording. However, in a situation where discs which can cope with four-times and eight-times higher speed are mixed in a market, there may be a problem that the drive device erroneously ejects a recordable disc, because the part versions are not coincident.<br>
10	For example, it is supposed that the part version of the<br>
four-times higher speed disc is 2 . Ox and the part version of the eight-times higher speed disc is 3 . Ox. Normally, in order to ensure the compatibility with lower versions , the eight-times higher speed disc is produced to be able to record information with a four-times<br>
15 higher speed mode. Therefore, on the eight-times higher speed disc, not only the eight-times higher speed recording can be executed by an eight-times higher speed drive device , but also the four-times higher speed recording can be executed by a four-times higher speed drive device.<br>
20	However, according to the recording standards, since one<br>
disc has one part version, only the part version information of version 3..Ox is recorded on the eight-times higher speed disc as mentioned above. Therefore, in the case where the four-times" higher speed recording is tried on the eight-times higher speed<br>
25  disc by using the four-times higher speed drive device, the drive device reads the part version information (i.e., version 3.Ox) of the eight-times higher speed disc and compares it with the version information (i . e ., version 2 . Ox) of the drive device .  As a result, although the drive device can record information onto that disc<br>
30 by the four-times higher speed recording mode, the drive device regards the disc as unusable and ejects it.<br>
Thus, in a method of discriminating a recordable disc by using only the part version information, when information is recorded onto a disc of higher version by a drive device of lower<br><br>
version than the disc, the disc is automatically ejected although the recording can be actually executed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	The present invention has been achieved in order to solve<br>
the above problem. It is an object of this invention to provide an information recording medium and an information recording device that enable a proper judgment of the compatibility between a disc and a drive device and that ensures recording in a combination<br>
10  where actual recording is possible.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information recording medium including: version information indicating a version of a recording standard; normal recording condition information for recording information at a<br>
15 normal recording speed; high speed recording condition information for recording the information at one or more high recording speed higher than the normal recording speed; and compatibility version information indicating the version of the recording standard to which the high speed recording condition information is adapted.<br>
20	In the above information recording medium, the version<br>
information indicates a version of the recording standard to which the information recording medium is adapted. Moreover, the normal recording condition information for recording information at a normal recording speed, and the high speed recording condition<br>
25 information for recording the information at a higher recording speed than the normal recording speed are recorded. The recording condition information includes, for example, information about a write strategy for driving a laser light source in order to record information.  At. the time of recording the information, the<br>
30 information recording device compares the version information on the information recording medium with the version information of the information recording device so as to judge whether the information can be recorded or not. When the judgment is made that the information cannot be recorded based on the version<br><br>
information, further the compatibility version information is compared with the version information of the information recording device so that a judgment is made as to whether the information can be recorded or not. Therefore, even when the judgment is made 5 that the recording cannot be executed only based on the version information, if the judgment is made that the recording can be executed based .on the compatibility version information individually corresponding to the high speed recording conditions , the information can be recorded.  In such a manner, the judgment<br>
10 can be properly made as to whether the recording can be executed on the information recording medium or not.<br>
The version information and the compatibility version information may have a same number of bits, and may be defined in accordance with a same bit allocation rule.  In this case, a<br>
15 comparison process with the version information of the information recording device can be simplified.<br>
The version information may be recorded in a lead-in area of the information recording medium, and the recording condition information and the compatibility version information may be<br>
20  recorded on the information recording medium as prepit information.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided an information recording device for recording<br>
information on an information recording medium including version<br>
information indicating a version of a recording standard; normal<br>
25 recording condition information for recording information at a normal recording speed; high speed recording condition information for recording the information at one or more high recording speed higher than the normal recording speed; and compatibility version information indicating the version of the recording standard to<br>
30 which the high speed recording condition information is adapted, the information recording device including: a first judging unit for comparing the version information recorded on the information recording medium with version information of the information recording device to judge whether the information recording device<br><br>
can record information on the information recording medium or not; a second judging unit for comparing the compatibility version information of the information recording medium with the version information of the information recording device to judge whether 5 the information recording device can record information on the information recording medium or not, when the first judging unit judges that the information recording device cannot record information; and a recording unit for recording the information on the information recording medium when one of the first judging<br>
10 unit and the second judging unit judges that the information recording device can record information.<br>
According to the above information recording device, the version information indicating which version of the recording standard the information recording medium is adapted is recorded.<br>
15 Moreover, normal recording condition information for recording the information at a normal recording speed and high speed recording condition information for recording the information at one or more high recording speed higher than the normal recording speed are recorded.  The information recording device compares the version<br>
20 information on the information recording medium with the version information of the information recording device so as to judge whether the information can be recorded or not. When the judgment is made that the information cannot be recorded based on the version information, further the compatibility version information is<br>
25 compared with the version information of the information recording device so that a judgment is made as to whether the information can be recorded or not. Therefore, even when the judgment is made that the recording cannot be executed only based on the version information, if the judgment is made that the recording can be<br>
30 executed based on the compatibility version information individually corresponding to the high speed recording conditions , the information can be recorded. In such a manner, the judgment can be properly made as to whether the recording can be executed on the information recording medium or not.<br><br>
The information recording device may further include an ejecting unit for ejecting the information recording medium from the information recording device, when both of the first judging unit and the second j udging unit j udge that the information recording 5 device cannot record information. Thus , the information recording medium which is finally judged that the recording is impossible is automatically ejected from the information recording device and the recording is not executed.<br>
The recording unit may obtain the recording condition<br>
10 information corresponding to the version information of the information recording device from the information recording medium and may record the information based on the recording condition information. By this, the information is recorded according to the suitable recording condition information previously recorded<br>
15  on the information recording medium.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information recording device for recording information on an information recording medium including version information indicating a version o"f a recording standard; normal<br>
20 recording condition information for recording information at a normal recording speed; high speed recording condition information for recording the information at one or more high recording speed higher than the normal recording speed; and compatibility version information indicating the version of the recording standard to<br>
25 which the high speed recording condition information is adapted, the information recording device including: a judging unit for comparing the compatibility version information recorded on the information recording medium with version information of the information recording device to judge whether the information<br>
30 recording device can record information on the information recording medium or not; and a recording unit for recording the information on the information recording medium, when the judging unit judges that the information recording device can record the information.<br><br>
In accordance with the above information recording device , the compatibility version information is compared with the version information of the information recording device without referring to the version information, so that the judgment can be made as 5 to whether the recording information can be recorded or not. Thus, the judging process can be simplified.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information recording method for recording information on an information recording medium including version<br>
10 information indicating a version of a recording standard; normal recording condition information for recording information at a normal recording speed; high speed recording condition information for recording the information at one or more high recording speed higher than the normal recording speed; and compatibility version<br>
15 information indicating the version of the recording standard to which the high speed recording condition information is adapted, the information recording method including the steps of: a first judging step for comparing the version information recorded on the information recording medium with version information of the<br>
20 information recording device to judge whether the information recording device can record information on the information recording medium or not; a second judging step for comparing the compatibility version information of the information recording medium with the version information of the information recording<br>
25 device to judge whether the information recording device can record information on the information recording medium or not, when the first judging step judges that the information recording device cannot record information; and a recording step for recording the information on the information recording medium when one of the<br>
30 first judging step and the second judging step judges that the information recording device can record information.<br>
In accordance with the above method, similarly to the information recording device, the version information recorded on the information recording medium is compared with the version<br><br>
information of the information recording device so that a judgment is made as to whether the information can be recorded or not. When the judgment is made that the information cannot be recorded based on the version information, further the compatibility version 5 information is compared with the version information of the information recording device so that a j udgment is made as to whether the information can be recorded or not. Therefore, even when the judgment is made that the recording cannot be executed only based on the version information, if the judgment is made that the<br>
10 recording can be executed based on the compatibility version information individually corresponding to the high speed recording conditions, the information can be recorded. In such a manner, the judgment can be properly made as to whether the recording can be executed on the information recording medium or not.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention will<br>
now be described below with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
[DVD-R]<br>
5	At the beginning, a DVD-R serving as a recording medium<br>
to which the present invention is applied will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
First, the structure of the DVD-R will be described with reference to FIG. 1.  In order to clarify the structure, FIG. 1<br>
10  shows a diagram viewed from a rear surface of a disc. - In FIG. 1, a DVD-R 31 is a dye-type DVD-R which has a dye film 35 which serves as a data recording layer and on which data can be written only once.  The DVD-R 31 is provided with a groove tracks 32 serving as data recording tracks and land tracks 33 serving as guide tracks<br>
15 for guiding a light beam Br such as a laser beam serving as a reproduction light or a recording light, to the groove tracks 32. The DVD-R 31 is further provided with a protective film 37 for protecting the groove tracks 32 and the land tracks 33 , and a gold vapor deposition film 36 for reflecting the light beam B when<br>
20 recorded data are reproduced. Prepits 34 corresponding to prepit information are formed on the land track 33. The prepits 34 are formed before the shipment of the DVD-R 31.<br>
Further, on the DVD-R 31, the groove tracks 32 are wobbled with a frequency corresponding to a rotational speed of the disc.<br>
25 The wobbled groove tracks 32 are also formed before the shipment of the DVD-R 31, similarly to the prepits 34.<br>
When recording information (information such as image information to be recorded, other than the prepit information, and hereinafter, same as this) is recorded onto the DVD-R 31, a<br>
30 data recording device described later extracts the wobbling frequency of the groove track 32 so as to control the rotation of the DVD-R 31 at a predetermined rotational speed. Further, the data recording device detects the prepits 34 to obtain the prepit information, and sees an optimum output or the like of the<br><br>
light beam B serving as a recording light based on the prepit information. Still further, the data recording device obtains address information or the like indicating a position on the DVD-R<br>
31	onto which the recording information is to be recorded, and<br>
5  records the recording information on the corresponding recording<br>
position based on the address information.<br>
At the time of recording the recording information, the light beam B is irradiated, so that its center coincides with a center of the groove track 32.  By forming recording information<br>
10 pits corresponding to the recording information data on the groove track 32, the recording information is recorded. At that time, as shown in FIG. 1, the size of a light spot SP is set such that the light spot SP covers not only to the groove track 32 but also the land track 33  partially.<br>
15	The prepit information is detected from the prepit 34 by<br>
a push-pull method using a partially reflected light of the light spot SP formed on the land track 33. The push-pull method uses photodetectors divided by a division line parallel with a tangent direction of the groove track 32, namely, the rotational direction<br>
20 of the DVD-R 31 (hereinafter, referred to as "radial push-pull method" ) .  Also , a wobble signal is extracted from the groove track<br>
32	to obtain a recording clock signal, described later, which is<br>
synchronized with the rotation of the disc.<br>
Next, the description will be given of a recording format 25 of the prepit information recorded, in advance, on the DVD-R 31 with reference to FIG. 2 . In FIG. 2 , an upper part shows a recording format of the recording information data, and waveforms on a lower part show a wobbling state of the groove track 32 on which the recording information data is recorded (i.e. , a plan view of the 30 groove tracks 32). The upturned arrows between the recording information and the wobbling state of the groove track 32 schematically show positions where the prepits 34 are formed. In FIG. 2, the wobbling state of the groove track 32 is shown by a larger amplitude than an actual amplitude, for easy understanding.<br><br>
It is to be noted that the recording information data is recorded on the center line of the groove track 32.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2 , the recording information to be recorded on the DVD-R 31 is previously divided per sync frame, which is 5 a unit of information. One recording sector is formed by 26 sync frames, and one ECC (Error Correcting Code) block is formed by 16 recording sectors. It is noted that one sync frame has a length which is 1488 (1488T) times as long as a unit length (hereinafter referred to as "T") corresponding to a pit interval defined by<br>
10 the recording format at the time of recording the recording information. The portion having a length of 14T at the head of one sync frame is used as synchronizing information SY for synchronization of every sync frame.<br>
Meanwhile, the prepit information to be recorded on the<br>
15 DVD-R 31 is recorded per sync frame. In the case where the prepit information is recorded on the DVD-R 31 as the prepits 34, one prepit 34 indicating a synchronizing signal in the prepit information is inevitably formed on the land track 33 adjacent to an area in which the synchronizing information SY in each sync<br>
20 frame of the recording information is recorded. At the same time, one or two prepit (s) 34 indicating contents of the prepit information to be recorded is (are) formed on the land track 33 adjacent to a first half portion in the sync frame other than the synchronizing information SY.  It is noted that the prepits 34 are not occasionally<br>
25 formed on the first half portion in the sync frame other than the synchronizing information SY depending on contents of the prepit information to be.recorded.<br>
At this time, in one recording sector, the prepit 34 is formed only in even-numbered sync frames (hereinafter referred<br>
30  to as "even frames") and the prepit information is recorded.  Namely, in FIG. 2, in the case where the prepits 34 are formed in the even frames (as shown by an upturned arrows of solid line), no prepit 34 is formed in ODD frames adjacent to the even frames.  A relationship of existence/inexistence of the prepits 34 ( <br>
to as the prepits B0, Bl and B2 from the head of the sync frame) in one even frame and the following odd frame is set in accordance with whether the one even frame is at the head of the recording sector or not and in accordance with the contents of the information 5 to be recorded on the one even frame and the following odd frame. More specifically, in the case where the prepit is formed in the even frame, all the prepits 34 (i.e., the prepits BO, Bl and B2) are formed in the sync frame at the head of the recording sector.  In the sync frames other than the sync frames at the head<br>
10 of the recording sector, only the prepits BO and B2 are formed when the prepit information to be recorded on the sync frames, is "1" , and the prepits BO and Bl are formed when the prepit information to be recorded is "0". Moreover, in -the case where the prepit is formed on the odd frames, the prepits BO and Bl are formed in<br>
15 the sync frame at the head of the recording sector, and the case of the above even frames is applied to the sync frames other than the sync frames at the head of the recording sector.<br>
Whether the prepits 34 are formed in the even frames or the odd frames is determined dependently upon the position of the<br>
20 prepit 34 previously formed on the adjacent land track 33 . Namely, the prepits 34 are normally formed on the even frames. However, the prepits 34 are formed on the odd frames if the prepits 34 formed on the even frame adjoin the prepits 34 previously formed on the adjacent land track 33 in a radial direction of the disc of the<br>
25 DVD-R 31. By forming the prepits 34 in such a manner, the preprts 34 do not exist on the adjacent land tracks 33 at the positions adj acent to each other, thereby reducing an influence of a crosstalk at the time of detecting the prepits 34.<br>
Meanwhile, the groove tracks 32 are wobbled in the entire<br>
30 sync frame by a constant wobbling frequency fO of 140 KHz (the frequency with which 8 waves of the wobble signal may be included in one sync frame) . The data recording device described later extracts the constant wobbling frequency fO to detect a signal for controlling rotation of a spindle motor, and generates the<br><br>
15<br>
recording clock signal.<br>
In order to maintain a phase relationship between the prepit 34 and the wobble signal to be constant, the prepit BO is formed at a predetermined position remote from a starting position of 5 the sync frame (for example, a position remote, by 7T), and the prepits Bl and B2 are formed so as to be separated from the prepit BO by 186T (1488T/8). A prepit forming method is disclosed in detail in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open under No. 10-154332.<br>
10  [Part Version Information]<br>
Next, part version information will be described. As mentioned above, the part version information indicates a version of a recording standard to which the DVD-R disc is adapted. FIG. 3 shows a recording position of the part version information on<br>
15 the DVD-R disc. As shown in FIG. 3, the DVD-R disc 31 includes a lead-in area 52, a data area and a lead-out area 53, and the lead-in area 52 includes a control data zone 54. A head of the control data zone 54 is provided with a book type and a part version area 55 in which book type information 56 and a part version<br>
20 information 57 are recorded. It is noted that the part version information is also recorded in an area (ID1) for recording an ECC block address or the like in the prepit information shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The book type information 56 indicates a type of a recording<br>
25 standard (book) in which a DVD standard is described. Concretely, as shown in FIG. 3, the book type information 56 indicates that the disc is one of a read-only DVD, a DVD-RAM, a DVD-R and a DVD-RW by four bit data. In this embodiment, since the DVD-R disc is used, "0010b" is recorded as the book type information.<br>
30	Meanwhile, the part version information 57 indicates a<br>
version of the recording standard (i.e., part version) to which the disc is adapted. Concretely, as shown in FIG. 3, the part version information 57 indicates which part version of versions 0 . 9x to 3. Ox the disc corresponds to, by using the four bit data.<br><br>
In this embodiment, since the disc has a part version 3.Ox, the part version information "1000b" is recorded.<br>
Therefore, an information recording device (e.g. , a drive device) for recording the recording information data onto the DVD-R 5 refers to the part version information 57 to obtain the part version of the DVD-R, and then compares the obtained part version with a part version of-the information recording device. The detail of this operation will be described later. [Compatibility Version Information]<br>
10	Next, the- description will be given of compatibility<br>
version information which is one characteristic portion of the present invention. The compatibility version information describes the version to which the disc is adapted, in association with a recording write strategy.  The recording positions of the<br>
15 compatibility version information are shown in FIG. 4, As shown in FIG. 4, the compatibility version information is included in the prepit information recorded on the disc in the form of the prepits, and is described in the prepit information given by the prepits in the lead-in area.  In this embodiment, the compatibility<br>
20 version information is recorded in an area for defining the write strategy of double speed recording (ID6 to ID7) , an area for defining the write strategy for four-times higher speed recording (ID8 to ID10) and an area for defining the write strategy for eight-times higher speed recording (ID11 to ID13) in the prepit information.<br>
25 Also, as shown in FIG. 4, the compatibility version information indicates one of the plural versions of the recording standard, by the four bit data.<br>
As mentioned above , the part version information indicates a version of the DVD recording standard to which the disc is adapted,<br>
30 and only one version is determined for one disc. For example, the part version of a disc adapted to the eight-times higher speed recording is version 3. Ox, and the part version of a disc adapted to the four-times higher speed recording is version 2.Ox. For this reason, even if a drive device adapted to the four-times higher<br><br>
speed recording can actually record information on a disc, which is adapted to the eight-times higher speed recording, at four-times higher speed, the part version of the disc is only version 3. Ox which is the part version of the disc adapted to the eight-times 5  higher speed recording, <br>
On the contrary, jthe compatibility version information indicates all versions oif the recording standards with which information can be actually recorded on the disc. Namely, in the case where information can be recorded at the four-timejs higher<br>
10 speed on a disc which is adapted to the eight-times higher speed by an information recording device adapted to the four-times higher speed recording, the compatibility version information includes the version information corresponding to the four-times higher speed recording.<br>
15	FIG. 4 shows an example of the disc adapted to the eight-times<br>
higher speed recording, and the part version information of this disc is version 3.Ox (see. FIG. 3). However, as shown in FIG. 4, the compatibility version information include the version information for all of the write strategy for the double (two-times<br>
20 higher)"speed recording, the write strategy for the four-times higher speed recording and the write strategy for the eight-times higher speed recording. Therefore, in this disc adapted to the eight-times higher speed recording, the compatibility version information indicates that the write strategy for eight-times<br>
25 higher speed recording described in the area IDll to ID13 is adapted to the version 3.0x, the write strategy for the four-times higher speed recording described in the area ID8 to ID10 is adapted to the version "2.0x, and the write strategy for the double speed recording described in the area ID6 to ID7 is adapted to the version<br>
30 2. Ox. Namely, information can be recorded on the disc at any one of double speed to the eight-times higher speed by using the write strategy of the respective recording speeds.<br>
In this embodiment, bit allocation rule of the compatibility version information is identical to the bit<br><br>
allocation rule of the part version information shown in FIG. 3. This is advantageous in that the comparison process of the version information can be simplified, but it is not indispensable. Namely, the bit allocation rule of the compatibility version information 5 may be different from the bit allocation rule of the part version information. [Information Recording and Reproducing Device,]<br>
Next, an embodiment of an information recording and reproducing device of the present invention will be described with<br>
10 reference to FIG. 5. In the following embodiment, the prepits 34 including the address information or the like on the DVD-R 31 and the wobbling groove tracks 32 are previously formed on the DVD-R 31. When the recording information is recorded, an information recording and reproducing device S controls the<br>
15 rotation of the DVD-R 31 based on the wobbling frequency of the groove tracks 32, and detects the prepits 34 to obtain the address information on the DVD-R 31. Thereby, the information recording and reproducing device 5 detects the recording position on the DVD-R 31 and records the recording information.  Further, the<br>
20  information recording and reproducing device S detects the prepits 34 to obtain the compatibility version information from the prepit information shown in FIG. 4 and obtain part version information 7 from the control data zone in the lead-in area shown in FIG. 3.<br>
25	As shown in FIG.  5, the information recording and<br>
reproducing device S includes a pickup 1, a spindle motor 2, a spindle driver 3 , a laser driving circuit 4 , a power control circuit 5, an encoder 6, an interface 7, a reproduction amplifier 8, a decoder 9, a processor (CPU) 10, a reference clock generator 11<br>
30 for generating a reference clock signal for rotation control, a BPF (Band Pass Filter) 12, a prepit signal detector 13, a prepit signal decoder 14 , a wobble signal extractor 15 , a phase comparator 16 , a phase comparator 17 for generating a rotation control signal, a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit 18 and a phase shifter 19.  The<br><br>
PLL circuit 18 includes a phase comparator 181, an LPF (Low Pass Filter) 182, a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) 183 and a divider 184.<br>
The information recording and reproducing device S receives 5  recording information to be recorded from an external host computer (not shown) via the interface 7, and the recording information recorded on the DVD-R 31 is output via the interface 7.<br>
Next, an entire operation will be described.  The pickup 1 includes a laser diode, a polarized beam splitter, an objective<br>
10 lens and a photodetector, which are not shown. At the time of the recording operation, the pickup 1 irradiates the light beam B having an emitting power, which is supplied from the laser driving circuit 4 and changes in accordance with the laser driving signal based on the recording information, onto the DVD-R 31 so as to<br>
15 record the recording information. At the time of the reproducing operation, the pickup 1 irradiates the light beam B having a constant emitting power (i.e. , reading power) onto the DVD-R 31 and receives the reflected light by the photodetector.<br>
In addition, the pickup 1 receives the reflected light<br>
20 of the light beam B irradiated on the information recording surface from the information recording surface via the photodetector and converts the reflected light into an electric signal. Then, the pickup 1 applies operation processing based on a radial push-pull system onto the electric signal, for example, so as to generate<br>
25 a detecting signal SDT carrying a prepit signal of the prepits 34, a wobble signal of the groove track 32 and the recording information, and outputs the detection signal SDT to the reproduction amplifier 8.<br>
The reproduction amplifier 8 amplifies the detecting signal<br>
30 SDT carrying the prepit signal of the prepits 34 and the wobble signal of the groove track 32 outputted from the pickup 1, and outputs the prepit information signal SPP including the prepit signal of the prepits 34 and the wobble signal of the groove track 32 to the BPF 12.  At the time of r."ne reproducing operation, the<br><br>
reproduction amplifier 8 outputs an RF signal Sp corresponding to the recording information already recorded to the decoder 9. Meanwhile, the BPF 12 removes a noise component included in the prepit information signal SPP supplied from the reproduction 5 amplifier 8 and outputs a composite signal SPC, on which the prepit signal is superimposed at predetermined positions of the wobble signal (e.g. , maximum amplitude positions) , to the prepit signal detector 13 and the wobble signal extractor 15.<br>
The prepit signal detector 13 includes a comparator (not<br>
10 shown) which compares the composite signal SPC with a predetermined prepit detection reference level Vrp which is larger than the maximum amplitude level of the wobble signal. In a period in which the amplitude level of the composite signal SPC is larger than the prepit detection reference level Vrp, namely, in the period in<br>
15 which the prepit exists, the prepit signal detector 13 outputs a prepit detection signal SPD, which is a pulse signal, to the prepit signal decoder 14 and the phase comparator 16.<br>
The prepits signal decoder 14 decodes the prepit information, including the address information on the DVD-R 31,<br>
20 from the supplied prepit detection signal SPD to output the decoded information to the CPU 10. The prepit signal decoder 14 extracts the part version information,  the compatibility version information and the like included in the prepit information.<br>
The wobble signal extractor 15 serving as a wobble signal<br>
25 extracting device has a comparator (not shown) which compares the composite signal SPC with a predetermined level, for example, an intermediate level VrO of a PP (Peak-to-Peak) value of the wobble signal. The wobble signal extractor 15 outputs a pulse signal which is at H (high) level during a period, in which the amplitude<br>
30 level of the composite signal SPC is larger than the reference level VrO, to the phase comparators 16 and 17 and the PLL circuit 18 as an extracted wobble signal SWB.<br>
The PLL circuit 18 includes the phase comparator 181, the LPF 1S2, the VCO 183 and the divider 184, and outputs a clock signal<br><br>
SCK which is synchronized with the phase of the extracted wobble signal SWB to the phase shifter 19.<br>
The phase comparator 16 compares the phases of the prepit detection signal SPD and the extracted wobble signal SWB in 5 accordance with the operation described later, and outputs a phase adjusting signal SCNT which indicates a phase shift from a predetermined phase relationship, that the prepit detection signal SPD and the extracted wobble signal SWB normally posses, to the phase shifter 19.<br>
10	The phase shifter 19 adjusts the phase of the clock signal<br>
SCK supplied from the PLL circuit 18 based on the phase adjusting signal SCNT, and outputs it to the encoder 6 and the power control circuit 5 as a recording clock signal SCR.<br>
The phase comparator 17 compares the phase of the extracted<br>
15 wobble signal SWB with the phase of the reference clock signal SREF, which carries a reference frequency component of the rotational speed of the DVD-R 31 and is supplied from the reference clock generator 11, and supplies the phase difference signal to the spindle motor 2 via the spindle driver 3 as a rotation control<br>
20 signal. Thus, the spindle servo is performed, and the DVD-R 31 is rotated by the.spindle motor 2 at a predetermined speed.<br>
The interface 7 performs an interface operation for capturing recording information SRR supplied from the host computer (not shown) into the information recording and reproducing device<br>
25 S under the control by the CPU 10, and outputs the recording information SRR to the encoder 6 via the CPU 10.<br>
The encoder 6 executes an ECC process, a 8/16 modulating process and a scramble process using the recording clock signal SCR supplied from the phase shifter 19 as a timing signal so as<br>
30 to generate a modulated signal SRE, and output it to the power control circuit 5.<br>
The power control circuit 5 converts a waveform of the modulated signal SRE based on the recording clock signal SCR outputted from the phase shifter 19 (so-called, write strategy<br><br>
process) in order to maintain the shape of recording pits formed on the disc to be appropriate, and output it to the laser driving circuit 4 as a recording signal SD.- It is noted that the CPU 10 controls the waveform of the modulated signal SRE based on the 5 write strategy information (see. FIG. 4) in the prepit information generated by the prepit signal decoder 14.<br>
The laser driving circuit 4 outputs the laser driving signal for actually driving the laser diode (not shown) in the pickup 1 to emit the light beam B having the emitting power according<br>
10  to the supplied recording signal SD.<br>
The CPU 10 stores, in an internal memory, the version information of the device side indicating the recording standard at the time when the information recording and reproducing device S records the recording information.  At the time of the recording<br>
15 operation, the CPU 10 controls the entire information recording and reproducing device so as to obtain the address information from the prepit information supplied from the prepit signal decoder 14 and record the.recording information at the position on the DVD-R 31 corresponding to the address information.  Further, at<br>
20  the time of the reproducing operation, the CPU 10 controls the entire information recording and reproducing device S to obtain the recording information recorded on the DVD-R 31 from the decoded signal SDM and output it to the external host computer. [Information recording process]<br>
25	Next, the information recording process executed by the<br>
information recording and reproducing device will be described below with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 6. The information recording process described below is performed in such a manner that the CPU 10 of the information recording and reproducing device<br>
30 S shown in FIG . 5 executes a predetermined program of the information recording process which is prepared in advance. At that time, the CPU 10 obtains the part version information shown in FIG. 3 or FIG. 4 from the control data zone in the lead-in area on the disc or the prepit information as described below, and also obtains<br><br>
the compatibility version information shown in FIG. 4 and the write strategy information from the prepit information.<br>
First, when the CPU 10 detects that a disc is inserted into the information recording device (step S1) , the CPU 10 obtains 5  the part version information from the disc (step S2).<br>
Then, the CPU 10 compares the version information of the device, which is stored in the memory in the CPU 10 and indicates the recording standard that the information recording device uses to record information, with the part version information of the<br>
10 disc obtained in step S2 (step S3) . When they coincide with each other, it is found that the disc is adapted to the information recording by the information recording device. Thus , the process goes to step S6, and the CPU 10 controls the information recording device to record the information utilizing the write strategy<br>
15 corresponding to the recording speed indicated by the part version information.<br>
On the contrary, when the version information of the device and the version information of the disc do not coincide with each other, the CPU 10 obtains the compatibility version information<br>
20 from the disc (step S4) , and compares them with the version information of the device. When the version information of the device coincides with any one of the compatibility version information obtained in step S4, the CPU 10 obtains the write strategy of the recording speed corresponding to the coincided<br>
25 version from the prepit information shown in FIG. 4, and records information on the disc (step S6).<br>
When the version information which coincides with the version information of the device does not exist in the compatibility version information, the CPU 10 ejects the disc (step S7) and ends<br><br>
In the information recording process, first it is judged whether the version of the device coincides with the part version of the disc or not, and when they do not coincide with each other, it is further judged, based on the compatibility version information ,<br><br>
whether the information can be recorded on the disc at other recording speed or not. When the compatibil ity vers ion information corresponding to the version of the information recording device is recorded on the disc, information is recorded by utilizing the 5 write strategy adapted to the recording speed. [Modified example]<br>
In the information recording process described with reference to FIG. 6, first it is judged based on the part version information whether the information can be recorded or not, and<br>
10 when it is judged that the recording is impossible, it is further judged whether the information can be recorded or not,""based on the compatibility version information. Alternatively, the information recording device may be configured such that the judgment based on the part version information is omitted and the<br>
15 judgment as to whether the information is recordable or not is made only based on the compatibility version information . Further, the part version information is obtained from the disc in step<br>
S2,	and thereafter the compatibility version information is<br>
obtained from the disc in step S4 only when the part version of<br>
20  the disc is not identical to the version of the device in step<br>
S3.	However, the part version information and the compatibility<br>
version information may be obtained at the same time in step S2 .<br>
While the above embodiment is described by exemplifying a DVD device of exclusive use, such as a DVD-R/RW recorder, the<br>
25 information recording device or the information recording and reproducing device of the present invention may be realized by a DVD drive attached to a personal computer, for example. In that case, the same function as the above DVD device of exclusive use such as the DVD-R/RW recorder may be realized by the personal<br>
30 computer which executes an information recording control program for executing the information recording process . A user can obtain such an information recording control program in the form of a recording medium such as a CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM or by the data communication vid d communication device such as a network.<br><br>
The embodiment described above is directed to the case<br>
where the present invention is applied to the DVD-R, but the present<br>
invention can be similarly applied to another recording media such<br>
as a CD-R, a CD-RW, a DVD-RW and so on.<br>
5	As described above, according to the present invention,<br>
not only the part version information but also the compatibility<br>
version information are taken into consideration to determine<br>
whether information can be recorded or riot. Since the<br>
compatibility version information indicates the recording speed<br>
10 and the version information with which information can be recorded<br>
on the disc, a judgment can be accurately made on whether information<br>
can be recorded on the disc by the information recording device<br>
or not.	<br>
