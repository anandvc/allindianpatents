				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making silicon carbide-mullite composite useful for making industrial components and a process for making components thereof.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the development of a process for making consolidated and sintered silicon carbide - mullite composite with a mullite rich coating on the internal and external surfaces of the article produced.<br>
The main usages of the silicon carbide - mullite composite with a mullite rich coating on the internal and external surfaces of the articje produced is in the field of machines with static and mo\ing parts where the atmosphere is oxidising or neutral and where the operation takes places at room temperature, below room temperature and elevated temperature upto 1800°C, The component may act as component of a machine, as nozzle or in any shape as may be deemed fit. The said article may also be used as special refractory' material where thermal shock, abrasion, erosion, oxidative corrosion etc. are to be countered at room temperature, below room temperature and at elevated temperature uptc 1800°C.<br>
The present day methods of making silicon carbide - mullite composite sintered material essentially consists of using a mixture of aluminium powder, alumina powder and silicon carbide powder as starting material. The powders are mixed by attrition milling in acetone medium and then sieved to improve homogeneity. The powder is then isostaticalry pressed at. room temperature and fired in box type furnace to complete various reactions at 1100-1150°C in air. This product is then post HIPPED in argon at 1550°C and 200 Mpa for<br>
20 minutes . Reference may be made to Reaction Bonding and Mechanical Properties of muffite/sflicon carbide composites - Suxing Wu and Nils Claussen, J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 77 (11) 2898 - 904 (1994). where the product formed contained lesser amount of silicon carbide after it was consumed in large proportion by the reaction with aluminium in the system. Hipping is also a non - commercial method of production for all practical purposes. Similar was the case as referred to in "Grain size effect on creep Deformation of Alumina -silicon carbide composites - Hua - Tay Lin, Kathleen B. Alexander and Paul F. Becher, J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 79 (6) 1530 -36 (1996)", where silicon carbide based composite materials like SiC/ZrO2, SiC/Al2O3 etc are developed by HIPPING at 1650 - 1850°C for 2 hr in Ar , Reference also be made to " SiC - Whisker - Reinforced A12O3 composites by free smtering of coated powder" Hu and Mohamed N. Rahaman. J Am. Ceram. Soc. 76 (10) 2549 - 54 (1993) where high purity helium atmosphere was used for sintering. The main drawbacks of all the above processes are:<br>
1.	Silicon carbide powder should be very fine, more than 90 percent in the submicron<br>
range.<br>
2.	Silicon carbide powder should be ultra pure.<br>
3.	Aluminium powder is required in some process which is costly and require special<br>
protective handling of the material.<br>
4.	Afixing process require costly equipment like attrition milling with costly solvent like<br>
acetone as milling medium.<br>
5.	Firing in inert atmosphere is a necessary condition which require special type of<br>
expensive furnaces with inert gases like argon and helium.<br><br>
6.	Many of the processes require hot isostatic pressing which is not only a cost inhibitive<br>
process but also have several limitations.<br>
7.	Xo processes described so far produces any fired item which is coated by a mullite rich<br>
phase which imparts additional oxidation resistance to the fired components.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for making silicon carbide - muliite composite useful for making industrial components with a mullite rich coating on the internal and external surfaces of the article produced which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for making industrial components using the composite of the present invention.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to eliminate the process of grinding silicon carbide particles to above 10 m2/g to impart sinterability to the material.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to eliminate the process of purification of the silicon carbide particles to a ultra pure material to impart sinterability to the material.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to eliminate the process of firing the preiired (hither to referred to as green product) in argon, helium or nitrogen environment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce the firing temperature of the green product.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to form a mullite-rich material coat on the external and internal surfaces of the material in a single firing.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to increase the oxidation resistance of the component produced.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process to make consolidated mass of silicon carbide - mullite composites as ceramic engineering material.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process to make consolidated mass of silicon carbide - mullite composites as refractory material with improved quality.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to pimide a process to make consolidated mass of silicon carbide - nmllite composites as engineering ceramic material to be used upto 1800°C.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process to make consolidated mass of silicon carbide - mullite composites as refractory material to be used upto 1800°C.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for making components using the composite prepared by the process of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making silicon carbide -mullite composite and its components which comprises,<br>
a)	preparing silicon carbide suspension by mixing silicon carbide powder and water<br>
in the ratio 1:2 to 1:6 (g/v),<br>
b)	preparing aluminum nitrate solution by mixing aluminum nitrate in water in the<br>
ratio 1:4 to 1:6 (g/v),<br>
c)	mixing silicon carbide suspension and aluminiumnitrate solution in the ratio of<br>
1:165 to 1:465 (w/v), stirring for 3 to 5 hours,<br>
d)	adding ammonia to the mixture under stirring till the pH is in the range of 10-5 to<br>
11-5 to obtain gel like mass,<br>
e)	allowing the gel to age for a period of 8 to 48 hours,<br>
f)	washing the aged gel like mass and filtering,<br>
g)	drying the washed material at a temperature in the range of 100 ± 5 C for a<br>
period of 6 to 48 hours,<br>
h) heat treating the dried gel like mass at a temperature in the range of 800 to 850°C<br>
for 2 to 4 hours,<br>
i)   grinding and sieving to get the composite powder, j)   the said powder is formed into the components by cold isostatic pressing as<br>
herein described.<br>
In another embodiment the process for making components using the composite powder is isostatically cold pressing in a mould of desired shape and firing in an air environment at a temperature in the range of 1600 to 1800°C for a period of 1 to 5 hours.<br>
The details of the process of the present invention are given below:<br>
a)	Silicon carbide powder is mixed with dispersing agents and water (SiC: water =<br>
1:2 to 1:6 g/v) by constant stirring to prepare a suspension.<br>
b)	Aluminum nitrate solution (Aluminum nitrate: water =1:4 to 1:6 g/v) is added in<br>
the silicon carbide slip prepared in step 'a'.<br>
c)	The entire mixture is stirred for 3 - 5 hrs.<br>
d)	Ammonium hydroxide solution (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2. 1:2.5, 1:3 vol%) is slowly added or<br>
ammonia gas is passed in the mixture produced by step 'a' - 'c' till pH is 10.5-11.5.<br>
e)	The entire mass converts to a semisolid gel like mass which is allowed to age for 8-48<br>
hours.<br>
f)	Product formed in step V is filtered and washed by warm water.<br>
g)   The washed material is dried at 110 + 5 C for 6 to 48 hrs.<br>
h)   The dried material obtained in step 'g' is heat treated at 800 - 850°C for 2 - 4 hrs. in air environment.<br>
I)   The heat treated product is ground and sieved through 100 mesh.<br>
j)   The sieved powder is formed into green shape by cold isostatic pressing.<br>
k) The green pressed product is fired in air environment at 1600 - 1800°C for 1 - 5 hrs.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce consolidated silicon carbide muffile composite of various green shapes and sizes required for application as engineering and refractory material. Silicon carbide particles are always associated with a surface layer of silica which froms highly reactive silicic acid in the aqua suspension stage. Aluminium nitrate mixed throughly with the silicon carbide suspension, will be homogeneously distributed throughout the entire suspending mass. Ammonia solution will convert aluminium nitrate into aluminium hydroxide gel like mass that will remain intimately in contact with silicic acid perhaps forming alumino silicate hydrogel rich in aluminium. On dning the gel like mass will form a uniform layer of alumino silicate gel over the surface of the silicon carbide grains. Due to extremely high reactivity, this will form mullite and reactive alumina. This reactive alumina will combine with freshly formed silica during firing again forming mullite as the silica alumina system is in the alumina rich region. Since the reaction with oxygen in the air is predominant at the surface of the green compacts, more mullite will form at the surface of the component than inside and eventually the entire compact will be coated with muliite rich layer that blocks the path of further oxygen penetration in the compact system.<br>
