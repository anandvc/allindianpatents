METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL<br>
TRANSMISSION DURING SHIFTING EVENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for powertrain<br>
systems comprising electro-mechanical transmissions, and more specifically to<br>
control during transmission shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes ah input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively connected to an electrical<br>
energy storage device, comprise motor/generators operable to generate motive<br>
torque for input to the transmission, independently of torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electrical machines are further operable to<br>
transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to<br>
electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage<br>
device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the powertrain system, including<br>
controlling transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative<br>
devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical<br>
energy storage device and the electrical machines.<br><br>
2<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions are tasked with developing shifting schemes<br>
between various operating modes, including fixed gear modes and<br>
continuously variable modes. During execution of a shift into a fixed gear<br>
mode, there can be a change in operating conditions which can affect actuation<br>
of an oncoming clutch and associated driveline dynamics.<br>
[0004] Therefore, there is a need to for a method and apparatus to control<br>
operation of a hybrid transmission during gear shifting events, to address<br>
concerns mentioned hereinabove.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove, an article of<br>
manufacture is provided to effect a method to control operation of a<br>
transmission device of an exemplary powertrain during execution of a shift.<br>
[0006] In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method<br>
is presented for executing a shift from a first fixed gear to a second fixed gear<br>
in a powertrain system comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission operative to receive a speed input from an engine.<br>
The method comprises deactivating an off-going clutch, and generating a<br>
time-based profile for rotational speed of an oncoming clutch. The speed<br>
input from the engine is controlled based upon the time-based profile for<br>
rotational speed of the oncoming clutch and an output of the transmission.<br>
The oncoming clutch is actuated, preferably when the speed input from the<br>
engine is effective to substantially synchronize the speed of the oncoming<br>
clutch with a rotational speed of an output shaft of the transmission multiplied<br>
by a gear ratio of the second fixed gear, preferably after a predetermined<br>
elapsed period of time in the range of 500 milliseconds.<br><br>
3<br>
[0007] In accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided an<br>
article of manufacture, comprising a storage medium having a computer<br>
program encoded therein for effecting a method to selectively actuate a<br>
plurality of torque-transfer devices of a transmission device operative to<br>
receive torque inputs from a plurality of devices and operative to generate an<br>
output torque. The method comprises executing a shift operation from a first<br>
fixed gear to a second fixed gear.<br>
[0008] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0014]    Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings arc for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. I and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br><br>
4<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0015] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission embodying the concepts of<br>
the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated generally by the<br>
numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is preferably<br>
directly driven by engine 14. A transient torque damper 20 is incorporated<br>
between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input member 12 of the<br>
transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably comprises a<br>
torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping mechanism and<br>
a spring, shown respectively as 78 and 79. The transient torque damper 20<br>
permits selective engagement of the engine 14 with the transmission 10, but it<br>
must be understood that the torque transfer device 77 is not utilized to change,<br>
or control, the mode in which the transmission 10 operates. The torque<br>
transfer device 77 preferably comprises a hydraulically operated friction<br>
clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br>
[0016] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a power output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
|0017] Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the transmission 10 utilizes three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24 has an outer<br>
ring gear member 30 which circumscribes an inner, or sun gear member 32. A<br>
plurality of planetary gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 36<br><br>
5<br>
such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both the outer<br>
gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
[0018] The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
38, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 40. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each<br>
planetary gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the<br>
inner gear member 40.<br>
[0019] The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
46, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 48. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each<br>
planetary gear 50 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the<br>
inner gear member 48.<br>
[0020] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 arc compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined through a hub plate gear 54 to the outer gear member<br>
38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of<br>
the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26 are connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
[0021] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60. to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through a torque transfer device 62 which, as will<br>
be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the selection of<br>
the operational modes of the transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output<br>
member 64.<br><br>
6<br>
[0022] In the embodiment described herein, wherein the transmission 10 is<br>
used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline 90 comprising a gear box or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles or half-shafts (not<br>
shown) which terminate in drive members. The drive members may be either<br>
front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they are employed, or they may be<br>
a drive gear of a track vehicle.<br>
[0023] The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28,<br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also connected to a second electrical<br>
machine comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0024] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which permits<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72.<br>
[0025] A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with<br>
ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device, i.e. C4 75<br>
is operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting the<br>
sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62, 70, 73, 75 are<br>
all friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch Cl 70, clutch<br>
C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated,   receiving   pressurized   hydraulic   fluid   from   a   pump   when   a<br><br>
7<br>
corresponding clutch control solenoid is actuated. Hydraulic actuation of each<br>
of the clutches is accomplished using a known hydraulic fluid circuit having a<br>
plurality of clutch-control solenoids, which is not described in detail herein.<br>
[0026] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the electrical machines 56<br>
and 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74<br>
typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and<br>
electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store electric<br>
power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries<br>
without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is<br>
preferably sized based upon factors including regenerative requirements,<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range.<br>
The HSD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br>
module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines or transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is<br>
an element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2.<br>
The TPIM 19 communicates with the first electrical machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly communicates with the second<br>
electrical machine 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74<br>
is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power<br>
inverters and respective motor control modules configured to receive motor<br>
control commands and control inverter slates therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0027] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical machine,<br>
i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration<br>
control,   the  respective  inverter receives AC current  from the electrical<br><br>
8<br>
machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides current to the DC<br>
lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the inverters determines<br>
the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical energy storage<br>
device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines and the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics.<br>
[0028] Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear 80 may be presented from the<br>
input member 12. As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
electrical machines 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshingly<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The other<br>
end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a hydraulic/transmission fluid pump 88.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ("ECM") 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21. and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain through a<br><br>
9<br>
request for torque including the transmission 10. Exemplary vehicle operator<br>
inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission<br>
gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned<br>
control modules communicates with other control modules, sensors, and<br>
actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for<br>
robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the<br>
aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0030] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque To, an engine torque command,<br>
clutch torque commands for the various clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands.<br>
[0031] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (N1) to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br><br>
10<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0032] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes.<br>
[0033] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0034] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes a<br>
pair of power inverters and motor control modules configured to receive<br>
motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide<br>
motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to<br>
generate torque commands for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are implemented by the control system, including the TPIM .19, to<br>
control MG-A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and<br>
MG-B respectively, are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage<br>
device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27.<br>
Electrical current is transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0035]    Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br><br>
11<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0036] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules arc typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[()037] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13. the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested transmission output torque, To at shaft 64, also<br>
referred to as an operator torque request. Selectively operated components of<br>
the transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to<br>
the operator demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected a forward drive range and<br>
manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5<br>
determines an output torque for the transmission which affects how and when<br>
the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by<br>
other factors, including, e.g.. road load, road grade, and vehicle mass.   The<br><br>
12<br>
HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and<br>
determines the output of the transmission required to arrive at the desired<br>
torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0038] The two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission,<br>
includes output member 64 which receives output power through two distinct<br>
gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several transmission<br>
operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and Table 1, below.<br>
Table 1<br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated Clutches<br>
Mode 1	C1  70	<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR1)	C1   70	C4  75<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR2)	C1  70	C2 62<br>
Model 11	C2 62	<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR3)	C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR4)	C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0039] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated<br>
for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated<br>
in order to "ground" the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. A second mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device<br>
70 is released and the torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other<br>
factors outside the scope of the invention affect when the electrical machines<br>
56. 72 operate as motors and generators, and arc not discussed herein.<br><br>
13<br>
[0040] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds, No, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0041] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
C1 62 or C2 70. and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0042] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. N1/No, is achieved. The rotations of machines<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism<br>
as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, N1. determined<br>
or measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors<br>
or generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power<br>
flow, thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or<br>
any combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed<br>
Ratio GR1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is<br>
provided by power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B,<br>
through planetary gear set 28 by accepting power from the energy storage<br>
device 74.<br><br>
14<br>
[0043]    Referring now to Fig. 3, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, No, and transmission input<br>
speed, N, for the exemplary transmission and control system shown in Fig. 1<br>
and 2.  The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the<br>
specific gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to<br>
Table 1, above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges<br>
of operation for each of Mode I and Mode II.   The transmission operating<br>
mode is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon   various  criteria,  using algorithms and  calibrations executed  by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention.<br>
[0044]    Selection of  the mode of operation of the transmission depends<br>
primarily on operator input and the ability of the powertrain to meet that input.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3 and Table 1, a first range falls primarily within mode<br>
1 operation when clutches C1 70 and C4 75 are engaged. A second range falls<br>
within mode 1 and mode 11 when clutches C2 62 and C1 70 are engaged.  The<br>
first fixed gear ratio is available during mode 1, when clutches C1 and C4 are<br>
engaged.    The second  fixed gear ratio is available during mode 1, when<br>
clutches C1  and C2 are engaged.   The third fixed ratio range is available<br>
during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are engaged, and the fourth<br>
fixed ratio range is available during mode \\ when clutches C2 62 and C3 73<br>
are engaged.    It should be recognized that the first and second ranges of<br>
continuously variable operation for Mode I and Mode II may overlap.<br>
[0045]    Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations.  The output speed, No,<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed and transmission input speed, N1, measured at shaft 12, and speed<br>
limitations of the MG-A and MG-B.   Output torque of the transmission 64 is<br>
similarly limited due to limitations of the engine input torque and input torque<br><br>
15<br>
measured at shaft  12 after the transient torque damper 20,    and torque<br>
limitations of MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
[0046] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque. Such demands are typically<br>
communicated through inputs to the U1 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g. changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and there can be changes in system optimization that compel a shift change in<br>
order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage<br>
battery charging. A shift change may be predicated upon a fault in a<br>
component or system.<br>
[0047] The distributed control architecture acts in concert to determine a<br>
need for a change in the transmission operating state, and executes the<br>
forgoing to effect the change in gear. A shift change in the exemplary system<br>
comprises one of at least three possible situations. There can be a shift from<br>
one fixed gear to a second fixed gear. There can be a shift from a fixed gear to<br>
one of the continuously variable modes. There can be a shift from one of the<br>
continuously variable modes to a fixed gear.<br><br>
16<br>
[0048] When a shift is from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear, the shift<br>
process includes deactivating an off-going clutch, and actuating an oncoming<br>
clutch. By way of example, in shifting from GR 1 to GR2, off-going clutch C4<br>
75 is deactivated, and oncoming clutch C2 62 is actuated, permitting it to<br>
transmit torque. Clutch C1 70 is actuated throughout the process. Actuating<br>
an oncoming clutch preferably includes synchronizing the speeds of the<br>
elements of the oncoming clutch by controlling the torque-generative devices<br>
and, if necessary, controlling slippage of the oncoming clutch. Clutch speed is<br>
defined generally as a difference in speed between the elements of the clutch.<br>
[0049] A shift change out of any of the fixed gear operating modes can be a<br>
multi-step process, wherein torque transmitted across the off-going clutch is<br>
preferably off-loaded prior to its deactivation. Offloading torque across the<br>
off-going clutch includes adjusting torque-carrying across other torque-<br>
transmission paths, e.g. using MG-A or MG-B, and the oncoming clutch.<br>
Deactivating an off-going clutch comprises decreasing the torque-carrying<br>
capacity of the off-going clutch by reducing hydraulic pressure through<br>
control of one of the solenoids, as previously described.<br>
[0050] To effect a shift into a fixed gear, torque is off-loaded from the off-<br>
going clutch and it is deactivated. An input side of the oncoming clutch is<br>
preferably synchronized with the speed of an output of the oncoming clutch<br>
and slippage is controlled to minimize heat generation in the oncoming clutch<br>
while preventing or reducing driveline jerks and lurches. The oncoming clutch<br>
is actuated by controlling hydraulic pressure applied to the clutch to a<br>
magnitude sufficient to hold the clutch with zero slip across the clutch<br>
elements. Regardless of the type of shift being executed, a shift change takes<br>
a finite amount of time to execute, typically targeted for less than one second,<br>
and is predicated upon specific circumstances that are monitored and<br>
controlled by the control system described hereinabove.<br><br>
17<br>
[0051]    Referring now  to  Fig.  4,  the  invention  generally  comprises an<br>
algorithm resident in one of the modules of the control system and executed<br>
therein,  which  acts to  implement a method  to control  operation  of the<br>
powertrain system, i.e. the transmission 10 and the torque-generative devices<br>
14, 56, 72, during a shift from a first operating mode, preferably one of the<br>
fixed gears, to a second operating mode which one of the fixed gears. When a<br>
shift is commanded, the control system is operable to determine the specific<br>
torque transfer clutch to be off-loaded and deactivated and the specific torque<br>
transfer clutch to be actuated, based upon a calibration that contains the<br>
substance of the information contained in Table  1, above.    The off-going<br>
clutch  is deactivated, and  the transmission enters a speed  phase,  wherein<br>
output of the transmission is determined based upon operation of the electrical<br>
machines, MG-A and MG-B.   A time-based speed profile for the oncoming<br>
clutch established.  The output of the transmission, No, is monitored, and, the<br>
input speed, N1, from the engine is controlled based upon the time-based speed<br>
profile for the oncoming clutch and the output ol the transmission  preferably<br>
within   a   limited   elapsed   time   regardless  of a  change   in   output   of the<br>
transmission. This operation is described in detail herein.<br>
[0052]    Referring again to Fig. 4, a series of time-related data graphs are<br>
shown depicting an exemplary shift from a first fixed gear, in this example<br>
GR1, to a second fixed gear, in this example GR2. The first data graph depicts<br>
a measure of input speed, N1, plotted as a function of time for the exemplary<br>
shifting event. Prior to point B, the transmission is operating in first fixed gear<br>
GR1, characterized by actuation of torque-transfer clutches C1 70 and C4 75.<br>
At  point   B,  clutch  C4   is  deactivated,  and  the  transmission  operates  in<br>
continuously variable Mode 1, with only clutch C1 actuated, also referred to as<br>
a speed phase.   At point G, clutch C2 62 is actuated, and the transmission<br>
begins operation in second fixed gear GR2, and the speed phase ends. During<br>
the speed phase, elements of clutch C2 62 are substantially synchronized to<br>
permit actuation of the oncoming clutch C2 without driveline disturbances.<br><br>
18<br>
The process of synchronizing the elements of clutch C2 62 comprises<br>
controlling the input speed N, according to a predetermined control scheme,<br>
described as follows. The input speed N, determines the speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch C2, which yields speed of an element of the oncoming<br>
clutch. The speed of the other element of the oncoming clutch is the speed of<br>
the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28 directly connected to the<br>
transmission output member 64. The speed of the carrier 52 is calculable as<br>
being the speed of the output shaft 64, No, multiplied by the gear ratio, GR2,<br>
or N0*GR2. The total elapsed time for executing the shift from the first fixed<br>
gear to the second fixed gear is preferably in the range of about 500<br>
milliseconds, from deactivating of the off-going clutch to actuation of the<br>
oncoming clutch.<br>
[0053] Referring now to the second data-graph of Fig. 4, a graph<br>
representative of an exemplary time-based profile for rotational speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch Nc_DOT during the speed phase is depicted, elements of which are<br>
captured as calibration values in the control system. A time-based speed<br>
profile, shown as the third data-graph and comprising a change in speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch Nc_DOT  over the fixed amount of time, is generated therefrom<br>
and used to control input speed N1 during the speed phase of the shift. The<br>
oncoming clutch is initially operating at a known speed, Nc_INIT, determinable<br>
based upon the input speed N1 the output speed No, and the off-going gear<br>
ratio. The Y-axis of the graph is a measure of a change in the speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch, referred to as Nc_D0T. For each initial operating speed NC_INIT<br>
of the oncoming clutch, the operating profile for change in speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch Nc_DOT is determined in terms of the transmission output<br>
speed No, over the fixed amount of time.<br>
[0054] The operating profile is generated as follows, with reference the third<br>
data graph, which depicts a pre-calibrated formal for a time-based change in<br>
speed of the oncoming clutch NC_DOT, preferably stored in a non-volatile<br>
memory device of one of the control modules.  The pre-calibrated format for<br><br>
19<br>
time-based change in speed of the oncoming clutch preferably comprises a<br>
three-step format, designated by time-steps T1, T2, and T3, and each time-step<br>
is preferably a predetermined percentage of the total elapsed time for a shift.<br>
The total time Tl + T2 + T3 comprises the elapsed time from point B to point<br>
G. The first time-step Tl comprises a transition period, wherein there is an<br>
initial ramp up in the clutch speed. The second time-step T2 comprises period<br>
of steady-state change in speed of the oncoming clutch. The third time-step<br>
T3 comprises a ramp down in the speed of the oncoming clutch as<br>
synchronization occurs.<br>
[0055] Referring again to the data graphs of Fig 4, in overall operation<br>
rotational speed of each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 is determinable<br>
based upon input speed, N1, and output speed No. The elapsed time to execute<br>
the shift is fixed. The format for time-based change in speed of the oncoming<br>
clutch NC_DOT is pre-calibrated, and the desired fixed gear is determined, thus<br>
identifying which of the clutches is oncoming. Therefore, at point B, when the<br>
off-going clutch is deactivated, one of the control modules is operable to<br>
determine initial speed of the oncoming clutch, NC_INIT and a final speed of the<br>
oncoming clutch, which is fixed at zero since clutch speed is calculable based<br>
upon relative speed of opposing clutch elements. A specific time-based speed<br>
profile for the input speed N1 is generated based upon the pre-calibrated format<br>
for time-based change in speed of the oncoming clutch NC_DOT, and the output<br>
speed of the transmission, which is measurable. The "input speed N1 is<br>
controlled by controlling operation of the engine 14 via ECM 23. When the<br>
input speed N1 is synchronized with the speed of the output shaft 64, No,<br>
multiplied by the gear ratio, GR2, or N0*GR2, the oncoming clutch is actuated<br>
and fixed gear operation begins.<br>
[0056] Referring again to Fig. 4, aspects of the speed phase shift execution<br>
are described in greater detail. Line element A comprises a showing of input<br>
speed, N1, as a function of output speed multiplied by the First gear ratio, GR1,<br>
N0*GR1.   At time point B, a shift is initiated, with an intent to shift into the<br><br>
20<br>
second gear, GR2, represented by Line element D. In a first exemplary shift<br>
event, Line segments C and F represent input speed, N1, for a shift event<br>
wherein there is no change in output speed of the transmission during the<br>
speed phase of the shift. At time point G, when the input speed, N1, is<br>
synchronized with output speed multiplied by the second gear ratio, N0*GR2,<br>
oncoming clutch C2 62 is actuated. From this point forward, the transmission<br>
operates in the second fixed gear, GR2. The elapsed time from point B to<br>
point G is a fixed amount of time, typically around 500 milliseconds.<br>
[0057] In a second exemplary shift event, Line segments C and F' represent<br>
input speed, Nb for a shift event wherein there is a change in the output of the<br>
transmission during the speed phase. At point H the transmission output No<br>
changes to No', further represented by the line segment F'. The control<br>
system, which monitors output speed No, is operable to recalculate the time-<br>
based profile for speed of the oncoming clutch, and adjust the engine input<br>
speed, N1, to achieve the change in clutch speed to synchronize to the changed<br>
output speed No'. Point G' represents the point in time at which the input<br>
speed, N1, synchronizes with the output of the transmission, multiplied by the<br>
intervening gear ratio, N0'*GR2. At time point G', when the input speed. N1,<br>
is synchronized with output speed multiplied by the second gear ratio,<br>
N0'*GR2, oncoming clutch C2 62 is actuated. From this point forward, the<br>
transmission operates in the second fixed gear, GR2. The elapsed time from<br>
point B to point G' *is the aforementioned fixed amount of time, typically<br>
around 500 milliseconds.<br>
[0058] In operation, rotational speed of the oncoming clutch is preferably<br>
synchronized with the transmission output speed multiplied by the oncoming<br>
gear ratio, N0*GR2, in order to effect a shift into the oncoming fixed gear<br>
without inducing driveline dynamics, e.g. ringing, jerks, and clutch slippage.<br>
In the exemplary transmission 10, when the output speed, N0, and oncoming<br>
gear ratio arc known, the synchronized speed of the oncoming clutch, in this<br>
example C2, is calculable based upon the output speed and oncoming gear<br><br>
21<br>
ratio, i.e. NC2 = N0*GR2. The control system controls the input speed, N1,<br>
through known engine control algorithms, including subsequent changes in<br>
output speed, to synchronize the speed of the oncoming clutch and effect<br>
actuation of the clutch in the elapsed amount of time.<br>
