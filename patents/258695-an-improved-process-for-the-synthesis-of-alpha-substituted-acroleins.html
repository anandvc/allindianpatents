				<td>PROCESS FOR SYNTHESIS OF a- SUBSTITUTED ACROLEINS Field of Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the synthesis of α-substituted acroleins of formula CH2=CR-CHO where R is an alkyl or aryl group.<br>
The present invention particularly provides a single stage synthesis of alpha substituted acroleins from olefins by a tandem hydroformylation and Mannich reaction sequence in the presence of syngas and formaldehyde. The two catalysts employed for the tandem reaction can interact with each other and get deactivated, if present in one phase. These catalysts are hence segregated into two different phases thereby preventing deactivation of the catalysts by each other, and yielding a highly selective and active catalyst. Background of the invention<br>
a-substituted acroleins find application in specialty polymers and Pharmaceuticals. The sequential hydroformylation - Mannich reaction for the formation of cc-p unsaturated aldehydes is very well documented in literature. The reaction proposed invariably deal with the formation of an unsaturated aldehyde by condensation of two aldehyde molecules, both of which are in turn prepared by the hydrofomylation of olefins. In effect the reaction is a hydrofomylation- homoaldol reaction since the aldol reaction is mainly between two similar aldehyde molecules. The hydroformylation of propene followed by the aldol condensation of the formed butyraldehyde as a route to 2 ethyl hexanol is very well documented and is a commercial application. In this context reference may be made to British Patent 1002429 wherein the preparation of 2 ethyl hexanol via the hydrofomylation of propene is proposed. The catalysts used in this invention relate to cobalt compounds and the reaction is carried out between the butraldehyde formed via the hydroformylation reaction. The reaction is conducted in a basic medium that is a homogeneous phases. The drawbacks are that the aldol condensation is a homoaldol formation and not a hetero-aldol reaction as proposed in the present invention.<br>
Reference is made to US Patent 6573414 wherein the formation of C9 and Cio alcohols is achieved by a hydroformylation of butene to C5 aldehydes followed by aldol condensation to yield C10 alcohols. The drawbacks are that the different reactions involved viz hydroformylation, aldolisation and subsequent hydrogenation<br>
are carried out in multiple stage and not in a single reactor as is claimed in the present invention.<br>
Reference is made to US Patent 5689010 wherein a single stage process for the hydroformylation and aldol condensation has been proposed. In this patent the aldol condensation is primarily between the aldehydes formed in the course of hydroformylation reaction. Due to such a system it is not possible to achieve a hetero aldol condensation which is necessary to achieve the formation of a substituted acroleins.<br>
A one stage process for the preparation of higher aldehydes by hydroformylation - aldol condensation is described in PCT Application WO 80/01691. Herein rhodium complex catalysts have been proposed for hydroformylation of higher α-olefins. The aldol condensation is catalyzed by the presence of bases like KOH and Lewis bases. Here too only homo aldol formation is carried out.<br>
Reference is made to US Patent 3278612 wherein the use of alkaline medium has been postulated to achieve hydroformylation - aldol condensation in the presence of cobalt catalysts. The drawbacks are that this invention pertains to homo aldol condensation.<br>
Reference is also be made to US Patents 4426542, 5463147, 5462986, 5369162, 5382716 and 5268514 wherein a multistage process incorporating hydroformylation, followed by aldol condensation of the formed aldehydes with subsequent hydrogenation of the unsaturated aldehydes to higher alcohols is proposed. In all these patents no reference is made to the aldol condensation of two dissimilar aldehydes.<br>
Synthesis of a-substituted acroleins by reaction of aldehydes with formaldehyde in the presence of a base is well documented in literature. [See for reference Ulllmann's Encyclopeida of Industrial Chemistry, Vol Al, page 149 to 160, 5th edition] The aldol condensation of propionaldehydes with formaldehyde to yield methacrolein is also a very well practiced process as indicated in the above reference.<br>
Reference is made to US Patents 4408079 and 4496770 wherein aldol condensation of aldehyde and formaldehyde is reported in the presence of secondary amine catalysts to yield a-alkyl acroleins. The use of amines in the presence of organic acids is also said to improve the yield of the desired product. In these patents<br>
the aldol condensation is a unique reaction and not coupled with any other previous reaction, which generates the aldehyde. The use of a two-phase system has also not been mentioned.<br>
In all the above mentioned prior art the following drawbacks can be summarized:<br>
(i) Sequential hydroformylation of olefm followed by aldol condensation of the formed aldehyde with formaldehyde already present in the reaction medium, has not been mentioned.<br>
(ii)   The   deactivation   of the   aldolisation   catalysts   in   the   presence   of the hydroformylation catalysts, formaldehyde under reaction conditions has not been indicated, (iii)  The use of a strategy to segregate the two catalysts to achieve the desired<br>
synthesis of substituted acroleins has not been mentioned. Objects of the invention<br>
. The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the tandem synthesis ofα-substituted acroleins having formula (I), which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a strategy for the segregation of two incompatible catalysts into two distinct phases in order to ensure a tandem reaction sequence, such segregation can provide a method for the conversion of multistage processes into a single stage reaction, as has been shown for the preparation of a-substituted acroleins.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to promote the cross aldol reaction  between  an  aldehyde  formed  by the  hydroformylation  reaction,  and formaldehyde already present  in the reaction medium, to achieve the desired preparation of a substituted acrolein in high yield.

The present invention provides an improved process for the synthesis of α-substituted acroleins of the formula CH2=CR-CHO where R is an alkyl or aryl group. The process comprises hydroformylating a mixture of olefin and syngas together or a mixture of olefin and carbon monoxide and hydrogen separately, in presence of a hydrofomylation catalyst or catalyst precursor and in presence or absence of an additional ligand in the organic phase to obtain the corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde obtained is subjected to aldol condensation with formaldehyde using an aldolisation catalyst in aqueous phase. Both reactions, viz, hydroformylation and aldol isation are conducted simultaneously in a biphasic aqueous-organic system. This ensures the segregation of the two catalysts into two distinct phases, such that the hydroformylation reaction of olefin is catalyzed by a rhodium complex catalyst/precursor and additional ligand, present in the organic medium, and the aldol condensation reaction being catalyzed by an aldolisation catalyst comprising of a secondary amine or a secondary amine/organic acid catalyst present in the aqueous catalyst present in the aqueous medium. The temperature of the reaction is preferably in the range of 25-200°C, and the carbon monoxide and hydrogen pressure in the range of 10-1500 psi.<br>
The rhodium complex catalysts used for the hydroformylation of olefins are organometallic complexes of rhodium having the formula Rh (A)p (B)q (C)r (D)s where A, B,C, D could be ligands selected from H, trialkyl phosphines, triaryl phosphines, carbonyl, trialkyl arsine, triaryl arsines, alkyl aryl phosphines, tri alkyl amines, triaryl amines, alkyl aryl amines, bisphosphines, diimines and p+q+r+s is equal to 4 or 5 or 6, such that the resultant complex is soluble in the organic media consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and higher alcohols or mixtures thereof. Exemplary catalysts that can be used are HRh(CO) (PPh3)3, Rh<br>
(CO) (CI) (PPH3)2, RH (CO)2 (acetylacetone), [Rh (Cyclooctadiene) CI]2, HRh (CO)<br>
(Pn-butyl3)3,	(diphenylphosphinoethane),	HRh	(CO)	(PPh3)<br>
diphenylphosphinopropane), HRh (CO) (PPh3) (diphenylphosphinbutane), etc.<br>
The reaction is conducted using a rhodium complex precursor, in the presence of additional ligand which may or may not be identical to the ligand already coordinated to the metal precursor, the ligands employed being water insoluble and could belong to the general family aryl, alkyl and alkylaryl secondary or tertiary phosphines; aryl, alkyl and alkylaryl secondary or tertiary phosphates; aryl alkyl and alkylaryl secondary or tertiary arsines; aryl and alkylaryl tertiary amines; pentanediones, and substituted pentanediones, acetylacetonates; Schiff bases; aryl, alkyl and alkylaryl bisphosphines. Exemplary ligands that can be used are triphenylphosphine, tri n-butylphosphine, acetylacetone, tributylphospite, triphenylphosphite, triphenyl amine, tributylamine, triphenylarsine.<br>
The reaction is carried out in presence of excess ligand and mole ratio of metal to free ligand is between 0.1 to 10. The catalyst used for aldol reaction is soluble in aqueous medium and comprises of secondary aryl or alkyl amines such as diethyl amine, dimethyl amine, methyl ethyl amine, dibutyl amine, dibenzyl diphenyl amine, piperidine, morpholine, piperazine, pyrolidine. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic acid selected from acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in order to facilitate the aldolisation reaction. The mole ratio of secondary amine aldolisation catalyst to the added organic acid varies between 0.01-10. The mole ratio of the hydro form ylation catalyst to the aldolisation catalyst used varies from 0.01 to 10000, and preferably between 0.1 to 1000.<br>
The organic phase of the present invention is immiscible with water and is selected from aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and higher alcohols such as toluene, xylene cyclohexane, heptane, decanol and mixtures thereof.<br>
The formaldehyde used is either utilized as an aqueous solution or in the form of paraformaldehyde and can comprise commercial available formaldehyde solution that is stabilized.<br>
The formaldehyde is taken in proportion to the amount of olefin, the mole ratio of olefm to formaldehyde varies from 0.1 to 100, and preferably between 0.5 to 10. The ratio of the formaldehyde to the olefin can decide the activity for the aldolisation reaction. The presence of excess of formaldehyde can result in favouring cross aldolisation, which is the desired reaction. The olefin can be a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted olefm with a carbon number from 2 to 10. The reaction is conducted in the presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and the pressure of both these varies between 10 to 1500 psi each, and preferably between 50 to 450 psi each.<br>
The product a substituted acrolein is preferentially soluble in the organic medium. The reaction can be conducted either as a batch or a continuous reaction with continuous addition of olefm and carbon monoxide and hydrogen as per the consumption. In one feature of the invention, the olefin used is ethylene and the product obtained is methacrolein.<br>
The process of the present invention is described hereinbelow with reference to the examples, which are illustrative and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 show that in the absence of segregation of the two catalysts the aldolisation catalyst gets deactivated, and no methacrolein is formed. EXAMPLE 1<br>
A reaction was conducted in a 300ml Stainless steel reactor as follows: Aqueous phase- 90cm3 water containing 0.37 mol formaldehyde, diethyl amine -8.4 x 10'3 mol, acetic acid- 8.8x10'3 mol (Rh(COD)CI)2 4.09x10'6 mol, Rh: Triphenyl phosphine trisulfanotosodium [TPPTS] 1: 60; organic phase - 10cm3 toluene. The autoclave was pressurized with syngas 3.772 Mpa, (CO: H2, 1:1) and ethylene 0.419 Mpa. The autoclave was heated up to 333K and the reaction was continued for 6 hours. An induction period of 30 minutes was observed. At the end of the reaction the autoclave and it contents were cooled to room temperature. Analysis of the reaction mixture showed a 0.021 moles propionaldehyde. No methacrolein was formed. EXAMPLE 2<br>
A reaction was conducted in a 300ml Stainless steel reactor as follows: Aqueous phase- 90cm3 water containing 0.37 mol formaldehyde: organic phase- 10 cm3 toluene containing diphenyl amine-8.4 x 10"3 mol, (HRh (CO) (PPh3)3 4.09X10"6 mol, Rh: Triphenyl phosphine 1:6.

The autoclave was pressurized with syngas 3.772 MPa, (CO: H2, 1:1) and ethylene 0.419 Mpa. The autoclave was heated up to 333K and the reaction was continued for 6 hours. At the end of the reaction the<br>
autoclave and its contents were cooled to room temperature. The analysis of the product showed 66% conversion of ethylene with propionaldehyde 0.0073 mol and methacrolein 0.0101 mol. EXAMPLE 6<br>
A reaction was conducted in a 300ml Stainless steel reactor as follows: Aqueous phase - (35%) formaldehyde- 30cm3, water-50cm3 diethyl amine 8.4xlO"3 moles, propionic acid- 8.8 x 10"3 moles; organic phase: Toluene- 20cm3, HRh (CO) (PPh3)3-2.72 xlO"5 moles, PPh3. 1.83X10"4 moles. The autoclave was pressurized with syngas 3.772 MPa, (CO: H2, 1:1) and ethylene 0.419 Mpa. The autoclave was heated up to 333 K and the reaction was continued for 6 hours. At the end of the reaction the autoclave and its contents were cooled to room temperature. The analysis of the product showed 66% conversion of ethylene with propionaldehyde 0.002 mol and methacrolein 0.015 mol. EXAMPLE 7<br>

At the end of the reaction the autoclave and its contents were cooled to room temperature. The analysis of the product showed 67% conversion of ethylene with propionaldehyde 0.0046 mol and methacrolein 0.0128 mol.<br>
Example 8 shows the improvement on methacrolein yield by a continuous feed of ethylene and syngas as per the consumption EXAMPLE 8<br>
To improve the selectivity to methacrolein and to avoid methacrolein degradation a tandem reaction was conducted in the presence of a continuous feed of ethylene and syngas (CO/H2) in a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 as per the consumption. The reaction was conducted in a 300ml Stainless Steel reactor as follows: aqueous phase -(35%) formaldehyde- 30cm3, water- 50cm3' diethyl amine- 1.86 x 10"2 moles, acetic-1.76 xlO"2 moles; organic phase: Toluene - 20cm3, HRh (CO) PPh3)3. 5.44 x 10"5 moles, PPh3. 3.66x 10 moles the autoclave was pressurized with syngas 3.772 Mpa, (CO: H2, 1:1) and ethylene 0.419 MPa. The autoclave was heated up to 333K, the<br>
only difference being that ethylene, and syngas (CO/H2) in a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 as per the consumption were supplied to the reactor, which was maintained at a constant pressure. The reaction was carried out for 7 hours. A total of 0.04 mol of ethylene and 0.04 mol of carbon monoxide and hydrogen each were fed to the reactor, during this period, to make up for the drop in pressure due to the consumption of ethylene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the required stoichiometry. At the end of 7 hours the reactor was cooled and the contents analysed. The methacrolein formed was 0.0375 mol along with propionaldehyde 0.0021 mol. This corresponds to a selectivity of 93.8% to methacrolein based on ethylene conversion. EXAMPLE 9<br>
Example 9 shows the activity of the catalysts system on recycle. A reaction was taken in a 300ml Stainless steel reactor as follows: aqueous phase (35%) formaldehyde - 30cm3, water -50cm3, diethyl amine- 1.86 x 10"2moles, acetic acid-1.76 x 10'2 moles. Organic phase: Toluene - 20cm3, HRh (CO) (PPH3) 3- 5.44 x 10'5 moles PPhs- 3.66 x 10"4 moles. The autoclave was pressurized with syngas 3.772 Mpa, (CO: Ft, 1:1) and ethylene 0.419 Mpa. The autoclave was heated up to 333K and the reaction was continued for 6 hours. At the end of the reaction the autoclave and its contents were cooled to room temperature. The analysis of the product showed 67% conversion of ethylene with propionaldehyde 0.0035 mol and methacrolein 0.234 mol. Following this the organic phase of the reaction was vacuum distilled to remove methacrolein and made up to 20ml with toluene, to make up for the loss of toluene during distillation. This organic phase was recycled to the reactor along with the aqueous phase and the reaction was taken under the conditions mentioned earlier. At the end of 6 hours the reactor was discharged. The analysis of the product showed 74% conversion of ethylene with propionaldehyde 0.00207 mol and methacrolein 0.0198 mol.<br>
From these examples it is clear that when the reaction is carried out in a way such that both catalysts are present in the same phase i.e. either aqueous or organic phase, the interaction between the two, under reaction conditions results in the deactivation of the aldolisation catalyst. Hence a segregation of the two catalysts is essential to achieve a stable and robust catalytic system capable of catalyzing the tandem reaction of hydroformylation and aldolisatin respectively. This has been achieved by solubilising the hydroformylation catalyst in the organic phase, wherein the olefin and syngas have a high solubility, so as to have the hydroformlation<br>
reaction in high efficiency. The product formed has reasonable solubility in the aqueous phase where the aldolisation catalyst is localized, along with the formaldehyde that is highly soluble in water formaldehyde rich medium resulting in cross aldol formation as against the homo aldol formation. The acrolein products formed are more soluble in the organic phase and hence removed from the aqueous phase, avoiding degradation due to the aqueous phase catalyst. The main advantage of the present invention are:<br>
1.	A strategy for the segregation of two non compatible catalysts into two<br>
distinct phases, to result in an active catalyst combination to facilitate a<br>
tandem sequential reaction using the two catalysts, in their respective<br>
media. This approach is demonstrated for the tandem synthesis of α-<br>
substituted acroleins.<br>
2.	A direct one-pot preparation ofα-substituted acroleins from olefin by<br>
hydroformylation reaction followed by aldol condensation of the formed<br>
aldehydes with formaldehyde already present in the reactor.<br>
3.	in  this  process  both  the  reaction  i.e.  hydroformylation  and  aldol<br>
condensation are conducted simultaneously in a biphasic aqueous-organic<br>
system, such that the catalyst for the hydroformylation reaction is present<br>
in the organic medium. And the aldol catalyst is present in the aqueous<br>
medium. This compartmentalization of two catalysts avoid the direct<br>
contact of the two catalyst which otherwise leads to deactivation of the<br>
aldol catalyst.<br>
4.	This one process is distinctly advantageous over hitherto known processes<br>
wherein the hydroformylation and aldol condensation is done in two<br>
stages.<br>
5.	Since the aldol condensation with formaldehyde takes place in water<br>
which contains formaldehyde, cross aldol formation is favored over home<br>
aldol formation leading to a high selectivity over conventional methods.<br><br><br><br>
