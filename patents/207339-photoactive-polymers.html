COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10; Rule 13]<br>
PHOTOACTIVE POLYMERS;<br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS CHAMERSTRASSE 50, 6301 ZUG, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED. 1<br><br>
Photoactive polymers<br>
The present invention relates to new photoactive polymers, and their use as orientation layers for liquid crystals and in the construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br>
Different electro-optical effects used for liquid crystal displays (LCD) require alignment layers with very high pretilt angles. Vertically aligned nematic (VAN) LCDs for instance require pretilt angles between 85° and 90°, measured from the surface plane. In the case of hybrid aligned nematic (HAN)-LCDs, the pretilt angle at one of the substrates has to be in the above range, whereas the tilt angle at the other substrate is low (typically 0-10°). Brushed polyimides which are capable of inducing high pretilt angles suffer from the known drawbacks of the brushing technique. In the case of VAN-LCDs especially scratches caused by brushing and insufficient pretilt angle uniformity are well known problems of the brushing technique. on the other hand, stable ;photoalignable matenals for high pretilt angles,which would solve they<br>
above problems,are not khown so far<br>
Most of the known electro-optic LCD-modes suffer from residual birefringence of the liquid crystal layer which results in reduced contrast, intrinsic colours and/or restricted viewing angles. Optical retarders are applied to the LCD to compensate for the residual birefringence. Tilted LC-configurations which are formed upon applying a voltage to the LCD are used in most of the commercialised LCDs to adjust grey scale. The very asymmetric viewing angle dependence of such tilted LC-configurations is optimally compensated if the optical axis of the compensating retarder is tilted as well. Liquid crystal polymers (LCP) which were photoaligned by LPP-materials prior to polymerisation are ideally suited to such an application, as the tilt of the optical axis can principally be adjusted to any value between 0° and 90° by the adjacent alignment layer. A drawback of known alignment materials inducing very high pretilt angles is their high surface tension which causes wetting problems. Consequently, it is not possible to coat a uniform layer of LCP-prq&gt;olymers on top of such alignment layers.<br><br>

The divalent, trivalent or tetravalent group J serves essentially as a grouping for linking the polymer main chain to the side-chain, which comprises the whole of formula I except M. Two of the valencies in J serve as linkages, indicated in formulae III to VIIII, via S6 to S10 within the main chain. The third and optionally the fourth valency serves as the linkage to one or two side-chain(s) of the formula I (formula 1 except M). The polymer chain may, however, also comprise building blocks of the formulae III to VIII in which the side-chain of formula I is absent, that is to say where the group J is merely divalent. The proportion of building blocks of the formulae in to<br><br>
VIII in which J is divalent, that is to say in which there is no crosslinkable side-chain of the formula I present, is generally less than 75 %, but preferably less than 50 % and more especially less than 30 %. Of the trivalent and tetravalent groups J that contain one or two crosslinkable side-chains of the formula I, the trivalent groups, that is to say those groups which are linked to only one crosslinkable side-chain of the formula I, are preferred.<br>
The photoactive polymer of formula I may be a homopolymer or a copolymer. However, we prefer it to be a copolymer.<br>
Preferably at least 50% of the monomer building blocks forming the main chain of photoactive polymer of formula I are linked to one or two side-chains, which comprises the whole of formula I except M. Especially preferred is a polymer in which at least 70% of the monomer building blocks forming the main chain are linked to one or two of the side-chains.<br>
Preferably the monomer building blocks carrying a side-chain are each linked to only one side-chain.<br>
The building blocks of the formulae IV, VI and VIII are amic acid groupings or amic acid ester groupings (i.e. carboxamide-carboxylic acid groupings or carboxamide-carboxylic acid ester groupings) which on the one hand may occur as a result of incomplete imidisation in the polyimide chain. On the other hand, polymers mat consist only of building blocks of formulae IV, VI or VIII, that is to say polyamic acids or polyamic acid esters, are important precursors for the preparation of the polyimides according to the invention and are also included in the present invention. Of those polymers which contain groups of formulae IV, VI or VIII, preference is given to those in which G is hydrogen, that is to say those which consist exclusively of, or contain some, polyamic acid groups.<br><br><br>

The polymers of formula I arc characterised by being readily accessible. The methods for the production will be known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The polymers of formula I, with acrylate, methacrylate and styrene derivative as repeating monomer unit, can be prepared in principle according to two different processes. In addition to the direct polymerisation of pre-finished monomers there<br>
exists   the   possibility   of  polymer-analogous   reaction   of  reactive   photoactive<br>
derivatives with functional polymers.<br>
For the direct polymerisation, the monomers and the comonomers are firstly prepared separately from the individual components. The formation of the polymers is subsequently effected in a manner known per se under the influence of UV radiation or heat or by the action of radical or ionic catalysts. Potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile or di-fert-butyl peroxide are examples of radical initiators. Ionic catalysts are alkali-organic compounds such as phenyllithium or naphthylsodium or Lewis acids such as BF3, A1C13, SnCl3 or TiCl4 The monomers can be polymerised in solution, suspension, emulsion or substance.<br>
In the second process a polymer of formula I can also be produced in a polymer-analogous reaction from a pre-finished functional polymer and a suitable functionalised photoactive derivative. Many known processes such as, for example, esterification, trans-esterification, amidation or the etherification are suitable for polymer-analogous reactions.<br>
This polymers have a molecular weight MW between 1 000 and 5 000 000, preferably however between 5 000 and 2 000 000, especially advantageously however between 10 000 and 1 000 000.<br>
The preparation of the polyamic acids and polyimides according to the invention is generally carried out analogously to the methods frequently described in the polyimide literature, for example Plast. Eng. 36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamentals and applications).<br><br>
For example, the polycondensation reaction for the preparation of the polyamic acids is carried out in solution in a polar aprotic organic solvent, such as γ-butyrolactone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or N,N-dimethylformamide. In most cases equimolar amounts of the dianhydride and the diamine are used, that is to say one amino group per anhydride group. If it is desired to stabilise the molecular weight of the polymer, it is possible for that purpose to add an excess or a less-than--stoichiometric amount of one of the two components or to add a monofunctional compound in the form of a dicarboxylic acid monoanhydride or in the form of a monoamine. Examples of such monofunctional compounds are maleic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, aniline and so on. The reaction is carried out preferably at a temperature of less than 100 °C.<br>
The cyclisation of the polyamic acids to form the polyimides can be carried out by heating, that is to say by condensation with removal of water or by other imidisation reactions with reagents. When carried out purely thermally, the imidisation of the polyamic acids is not always complete, that is to say the resulting polyimides may still contain proportions of polyamic acid. The imidisation reactions are generally carried out at a temperature of from 60 to 250 °C, but preferably at less than 200 °C. In order to achieve imidisation at rather lower temperatures there are additionally mixed into the reaction mixture reagents that facilitate the removal of water. Such reagents are, for example, mixtures consisting of acid anhydrides, such as acetic acid anhydride, propionic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, and tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tributylarnine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, lutidine, collidine etc.. The amount of reagents used in that case is preferably at least two equivalents of amine and four equivalents of acid anhydride per equivalent of polyamic acid to be condensed.<br>
The imidisation reaction can be carried out before or alternatively only after applica¬tion to a support. The latter variant is preferred especially when the polyimide in question has poor solubility in the customary solvents.<br><br>
The polyamic acids and the polyimides of the present invention has an intrinsic viscosity preferably in range of 0.05 to lO dL/g, more preferably 0.05 to 5 dL/g. Herein, the intrinsic viscosity (rinh = In ηrel/C) is determined by measuring a solution containing a polymer in a concentration of 0.5g/100ml for its viscosity at 30 °C using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent.<br>
The number of monomer building blocks from which the polymer chains according to the invention are synthesised can vary within a wide range. It is generally from 2 to 2000, but especially from 3 to 200.<br>
The polymer according to the invention may contain additives such as silane-containing compounds and epoxy-containing crosslinking agents for further improving the adhesion of the polymer to a substrate. Example for silane adhesion promoters were described in the literature, for example Plast. Eng. 36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamentals and applications). The above epoxy-containing crosslinking agent preferably includes 4,4'-methylenebis(N,N-diglycidylaniline), trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, benzene- 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid l,2:4,5-N,N'-diglycidyldiimide, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, N,N-diglycidyl-cyclohexylamine and the like.<br>
The polymer according to the invention may contain additives such a photosensitiser, a photoradical generator and/or a cationic photoinitiator. Example for such additives were 2,2-dimethoxyphenylethanone, mixture of diphenylmethanone and N,N-dimethylbenzenamine or ethyl 4-(dimethylarnino)benzoate, xanthone, thioxanthone, lRGACURE™ 184, 369, 500, 651 and 907 (Ciba), Michler's ketone, triaryl sulfonium salt and the like.<br>
The polymers according to the invention may be used as a single polymer or as mixture with other polymers, oligomers, monomers, photoactive polymers, phoioactive oligomers and/or photoactive monomers. Thus the properties of the layer may be modified to give what is sought, lor example, an induced pretilt angles, good<br><br><br>
surface wetting, high voltage holding ratio, a specific anchoring energy etc. may be obtained.<br>
The polymers according to the invention can then be applied to a support and, after any imidisation step which may be necessary, crosslinked by irradiation with linearly polarised light, that is to say by cycloaddition of their side-chains containing the photoreactive group, there being obtained, depending upon the direction of polarisation of the light radiated in, a preferred direction of orientation and of the angle of tilt for liquid crystals that are bought into contact with the orientation layer. By spatially selective irradiation of the molecular units according to the invention it is hence possible for very specific regions of a surface to be aligned and provided with a defined angle of tilt. At the same time the orientation layer so produced is also stabilised by the cycloaddition.<br>
The present invention therefore relates also to the use of the polymers according to the invention as orientation layers for liquid crystals, and to their use in optical constructional elements, especially in the production of hybrid layer elements.<br>
Such orientation layers can be produced, for example, by first preparing a solution of the resulting polymer material, which is applied to a support, which is optionally coated with an electrode (for example a glass plate coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO)), in a spin-coating apparatus, so that homogeneous layers of 0.05 to 50 urn thickness are produced. Then, or optionally after prior imidisation, the regions to be oriented can be irradiated, for example, with a high-pressure mercury vapour lamp, a xenon lamp or a pulsed UV laser, using a polariser and optionally a mask for creating images of structures. The irradiation time is dependent upon the output of the individual lamps and can vary from a few seconds to several hours. The dimerisation can also be carried out, however, by irradiation of the homogeneous layer using filters that, for example, allow only the radiation suitable for the crosslinking reaction to pass through.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention are:<br><br><br>

Solution S1 was spin-coated at 2000 rpm onto two ITO (indium-tin oxide) coated glass plates, which were then dried for 10 minutes at 180 °C.<br>
Both substrates were subsequently exposed for six minutes to the polarised ultraviolet light from a 200W high pressure mercury lamp. The intensity of the UV-light, measured in a surface perpendicular to the propagation of the light was 1.6 mW/cm2. A film polariser HNP'B by Polaroid was used to polarise the UV-light. During irradiation the substrates were tilted by 70o respective to the direction of the incoming light.<br>
With the coated sides facing inwards, the two plates were assembled into a parallel cell, using a glass fibre of 20 μm as a spacer. The cell was immediately filled with a nematic liquid crystal mixture MLC 12000-000 (Merck) at a temperature only just above the nematic-isotropic transition temperature of 89 °C. After filling the cell was slowly cooled.<br>
Using the crystal rotation technique, the pretilt angle in the above liquid crystal cell was .determined as 88°.<br><br><br>

Like in example 5, solution S1 was spincoated on a glass plate, dried and subsequently exposed to the polarised UV-light, having an incidence angle of 70°. Then diacrylate solution S(LCP) was spin-coated at 800 rpm for 2 minutes on top of the irradiated LPP-layer. To cross-link the diacrylates the plate was exposed to isotropic UV-light under nitrogen atmosphere for 5 minutes.<br>
Between crossed polarisers it was found that the LCP-layer was well aligned according the direction of the LPP-irradiating polarised UV-light. From the strong asymmetric viewing angle dependence of the LCP-retarder it was concluded that the optical axis of the LCP-layer was highly tilted.<br>
To estimate the mean tilt angle of the optical axis, the effective optical anisotropy An, when looked perpendicularly through the layer was determined from measurements of the layer thickness d and the retardation And as Anefr= 0.033. From the known An - 0.13 of the LCP material the mean tilt angle the opticla axis was calculated as 58o<br><br><br>
