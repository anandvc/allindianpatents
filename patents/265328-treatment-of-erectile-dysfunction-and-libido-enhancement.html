				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to the treatment of erectile dysfunction and<br>
to libido enhancement in a male human or animal subject. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a substance or composition for such treatment; to the use of<br>
such substance or composition in the manufacture of a medicament or<br>
preparation; to such treatment; to compounds useful for such treatment and to<br>
derivatives of such compounds; and to a method of such treatment.<br>
Broadly, the invention provides a process for the production of a<br>
substance or composition for the treatment, by therapy or prophylaxis, or erectile<br>
dysfunction, and for the enhancement of libido in a male human or animal subject,<br>
the process comprising the step of formulating the substance or composition from<br>
at least one of plant material and an extract of plant material of at least one plant<br>
species of the family Geraniaceae.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a substance or composition in<br>
the manufacture of a medicament or preparation for the therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
treatment of erectile dysfunction or the enhancement of libido in the male human<br>
or animal body, the substance or composition comprising a formulation of at least<br>
one of plant material, and an extract of plant material of at least one plant species<br>
of the family Geraniaceae<br>
Examples of such plants include M. angustifolia, M. alexandraensi,<br>
M. attenuate (syn. biflora), M. brevirostrata, M. belfastensis, M. burkeana (syn.<br>
glanulata, betschuanica), M. depressa, M. deserticola, M. drudeana, M. galpini, M.<br>
glandulosissima, M. glauca, M. grandifolia (syn. Lanceolate), M. heliotropioides, M.<br>
ignea, M. ignorata, M. I'heritieri, M. lanuginose, M. longipes, M. luederitziana, M.<br>
malvaeflora, M. multifida, M. namaensis, M. natalensis, M. nivea, M. obcordata, M.<br>
ovata (syn. emarginata), M. parvifolia, M. rehmii, M. rudatisii, M. senecioides (syn.<br><br>
Praemorsa), M. senegalensis (syn. trilobata), M. speciosa L, M. spinosa (syn.<br>
lobata, pilosa), M. stricta, M. transvaalensis, and M. umbellata.<br>
The process may comprise formulating the substance or<br>
composition by size reduction into particulate form, e.g. by grinding (which<br>
includes milling) and/or cutting, of the plant material in the form of stems and/or<br>
roots and/or flowers and/or seeds and/or leaves. The grinding and/or cutting may<br>
be of wet plant material, followed optionally by drying thereof, e.g. by oven-drying.<br>
Instead, the grinding and/or cutting may be of dried plant material, the process<br>
optionally including the step of drying the plant material prior to the grinding and/or<br>
cutting. The process may then include packaging the dried ground plant material<br>
in porous bags of the nature of tea bags, or formulating the particulate plant<br>
material, after the size reduction, into granules, tablets, capsules, oral sprays,<br>
creams or lotions. Naturally, the particle size to which the plant material is<br>
reduced will be selected in accordance with suitability thereof for the final intended<br>
product.<br>
Instead, the formulating may comprise extracting the substance or<br>
composition from the plant material by subjecting the plant material, which has<br>
optionally been subjected to a prior size reduction, to solvent extraction using a<br>
suitable solvent, to obtain a solvent extract containing the substance or<br>
composition. Once again, the plant material subjected to the extraction may be<br>
wet, or it may be dried, having been subjected to an optional drying step prior to<br>
the extraction. If desired, after the extraction, the solvent may be removed to<br>
leave a dried extract comprising the substance or composition.<br>
The extract may thus be selected from organic and aqueous<br>
extracts. The extract may be selected from organic extracts produced by<br>
extraction of plant material with an organic solvent selected from the group<br>
consisting of diethyl ether, isopropyl ether, methanol, ethanol, chloroform,<br>
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, hexane and suitable mixtures of two or more<br>
thereof or mixtures thereof with water and aqueous extracts produced by<br><br>
extraction of plant material with water. Examples include<br>
methanol/dichloromethane mixtures and methanol/water mixtures, respectively in<br>
volume ratios, for example, of 1:1 and 9:1.<br>
Instead the extract may be an organic extract produced by extraction<br>
of plant material with a supercritical fluid. The supercritical fluid may be<br>
supercritical carbon dioxide.<br>
The solvent extract, whether in the form of a solution or after drying,<br>
for example by evaporation of organic solvents at atmospheric pressure (including<br>
supercritical fluid solvents), at a reduced pressure depending upon ambient<br>
temperature and pressure (organic solvents), or by freeze-drying or spray-drying<br>
(aqueous solvents), may be refined and/or separated into individual constituents<br>
or compounds, using a suitable technique such as solvent/solvent partitioning<br>
and/or chromatographic separation.<br>
The process may, as indicated above, include carrying out the<br>
solvent extraction on the plant material in finely-divided form, after its having been<br>
subjected to size reduction, for the purpose of facilitating subsequent solvent<br>
extraction, for example by wet or dry grinding or milling, to have a particle size of<br>
at most 6000um, preferably at most 5000um.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention cold solvent extraction at<br>
room or ambient temperature has been found to be adequate at, say 15-30Â°C, but<br>
the invention contemplates that the possibility of hot extraction at elevated<br>
temperatures of up to 100Â°C is not excluded.<br>
The Applicant has carried out the present process in particular on<br>
plants on the species Monosonia angustifolia identified as such by the South<br>
African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) in Pretoria, South Africa. Plants of<br>
the genus Monosonia are members of the Geraniaceae family, and M. angustifolia<br>
is a perennial herb with five petalled pink flowers whose geographic distribution is<br><br>
in open grassland throughout South Africa. A herbarium specimen has been<br>
deposited at the SANBI in Pretoria under Genspec. No. 39250002. Extracts<br>
obtained from Monosonia angustifolia,\r\ particular solvent extracts using a<br>
methanol/dichloromethane mixture as solvent, have been shown to be promising<br>
for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and libido enhancement in male subjects.<br>
Fractionation of organic solvent extracts, such as dichloromethane or<br>
1:1 by volume methanol/dichloromethane solvent extracts for example by<br>
solvent/solvent partitioning followed by column chromatography, has isolated five<br>
compounds believed to be active in the treatment or prophylaxis of erectile<br>
dysfunction and/or libido enhancement. The process may accordingly include<br>
isolating active compounds from the extracts, for example by fractionation such as<br>
by chromatography, e.g. column chromatography, followed by recombining the<br>
active compounds.<br>
The finished product can thus be in the form of a combination of the<br>
active compounds and/or the other chemical ingredients that are present in the<br>
plant extract. The active compounds may be extracted, as indicated above, by<br>
extraction techniques which include aqueous extraction, organic solvent<br>
extraction, and super-critical fluid extraction, or related chemical extraction<br>
methods, followed by drying (removal of the extracting solvent) by spray-drying,<br>
freeze-drying or evaporation. The extract can then be separated by solvent-solvent<br>
partitioning coupled with chromatographic separation techniques to give the active<br>
compounds. The active compounds can be formulated, for example and in<br>
particular, into suitable tablets, capsules and oral sprays.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided the<br>

The structures of compounds 3-7, are set out below<br><br><br><br>
The elucidation of the structures of the isolated Components 3 - 7,<br>
which were isolated by column chromatography from a sample obtained from the<br>
plant material of Monsonia angustifolia by solvent extraction using a 1:1 by volume<br>
material/dichloromethane mixture, followed by drying, partitioning between a 90:10<br>
methanol/water mixture and hexane, then partitioning the methanol/water layer so<br>
obtained with dichloromethane and evaporating the dichloromethane layer, was<br>
based essentially on spectral analysis. The 1H and 13C NMR (nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance) spectral data provided the first stage in the characterization of the<br>
compounds. When necessary, advanced homonuclear and heteronuclear two-<br>
dimensional NMR methods such as COSY (proton correlation spectroscopy),<br>
HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation) and HMBC (heteronuclear<br>
multiple bond correlation) were applied to achieve the complete assignments of<br><br>
the 1H and 13C correlations of the isolated compounds. From the proton decoupled<br>
DEPT (distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer) pulse sequence sub-<br>
spectra, protonated carbons could be assigned according to their multiplicity. The<br>
resulting 13C and 1H chemical shift experimental data of the isolated active<br>
Compounds 3 - 7 is collated in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hereunder.<br>
To confirm the so-established structures, the chemical shift data<br>
were compared to the data of the previously identified and known compounds on-<br>
line or using structural databases. The structures of the five compounds were<br>
elucidated as aryl naphthalene lignans which are biosynthetically formed by fusing<br>
at least two phenyl propanyl (C6-C3) units. Compound 3 was unambiguously<br>
identified as previously isolated from the plant Justicia procumbens and is known<br>
as 5-Methoxyjusticidin A (Siani, Antonio C et al Journal of Natural Products, 61(6),<br>
796-797, 1998) with a molecular formula C23H20O8and a corresponding molecular<br>
ion at m/z 424[M]+. Compound 4 has been identified as Justicidin A with m/z 394<br>
[M]+ (molecular formula C22H18O7). This compound is one of the most commonly<br>
known lignans found in plants (M. Okigawa et al, Tetrahedron, 26, 4301 - 4305,<br>
1970, L. Badheka et al, Phytochemistry, 25(2), 487 - 489 1986). Compound 5, is<br>
commonly known as Chinensinaphthol and it was previously isolated from Justicia<br>
procumbens (Z. Horii et al Chemical Communications, 653, 1968). A mass charge<br>
of m/z 380 was obtained for this compound, which mass charge is in agreement<br>
with the proposed molecular formula of C21H1607. Compound 6 (molecular<br>
formula C21H20O6) was found to have m/z 368 [M]+ and it was assigned the name<br>
Suchilactone based on literature and NMR spectral data comparison with the<br>
authenticated published data (S. Ghosal et al, Phytochemistry, 13, 1933, 1974,<br>
Biswanath Das and Ratna Das, Phytochemistry, 40(3), 931 - 932, 1995).<br>
Compound 7 (molecular formula C22H18O7) was elucidated as<br>
Retrochinesinaphthol methyl ether in conjunction with spectral data (Z. Horii et al,<br>
Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 19(3), 535 - 537, 1971) and a molecular<br>
ion [M]+ of m/z 394 was obtained.<br><br>

As described in somewhat more detail hereunder, the present<br>
invention provides a plant-derived treatment for alleviating erectile dysfunction and<br><br>
for enhancing libido in a male subject. The substances or compositions of the<br>
present invention have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the libido<br>
of male rats in terms of a so-called mating frequency/pregnancy model (MFM).<br>
From this enhancement of libido it can be inferred that the substances and<br>
compositions of the present invention will also be effective in alleviating erectile<br>
dysfunction in a male subject.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of non-limiting<br>
illustrative example, with reference to the following worked Examples:<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Extracts were prepared of plant material from the plant species<br>
M.angustifolia, identified as such by the SANBI in Pretoria. The plant material<br>
comprised the roots, stems, leaves and purple flowers, from which plant material<br>
the extracts were prepared.<br>
Initial liquid-liquid partitioning of the extract afforded hexane, dichloromethane and<br>
water fractions. Based on PDE 5 inhibition, the dichloromethane fraction showed a<br>
20% improvement in activity compared to the original crude extract. Repeated<br>
column chromatography on flash silica gel afforded the isolation of five<br>
compounds that were identified as aryl naphthalene lignans 3 to 7, which are<br>
formed biosynthetically from two phenyl propanyl (C6-C3) units.<br>
Characterization of 5-methoxyjusticidin A (3)<br>
5-Methoxyjusticidin A (3) was isolated as a white amorphous solid. A molecular<br>
ion peak at m/z 425.4 corresponding to [M+1]+ in the positive LRESIMS and at m/z<br>
424 in AutoSpec ETOF El+ which are both pointing to the molecular formula<br>
C23H20O8. The UV spectrum was obtained from a diode array detector (DAD) and<br>
absorptions were observed at A 365, 263 and 237 nm.<br><br>
In the 1H NMR spectra of 3 (Table 1) the presence of a methylenedioxy group, ÎH<br>
6.02 (1H, d) and Î´H 6.07 (1H, d) with a very small coupling of J 1.3 Hz was<br>
observed. The other methylene singlet observed at Î´H 5.41 is characteristic of the<br>
methylene group found in a penta-lactone ring of lignans. Four singlets assigned<br>
to the methoxyl groups were observed at Î´H 3.74, 3.95, 3.97 and 4.01. An<br>
aromatic proton singlet was observed for H-8 at SH 6.94. Three aromatic protons<br>
were found exhibiting the ortho coupling (J = 7.9 Hz) and meta coupling (J = 1.6<br>
Hz) which are consistent with a 1,3,4 trisubstituted phenyl group.<br>
The 13C NMR spectra showed 23 resonance signals. Four signals could<br>
immediately be assigned to the four methoxyl carbons resonating at Î´c 55.8, 61.4,<br>
62.4, and 62.0. The multiplicity of the other carbon signals was obtained from<br>
DEPT spectra that showed 10 protonated carbon signals, two of them being CH2<br>
and four were CH, apart from the four that were already assigned as methoxy<br>
groups. There was also evidence of a carbonyl group at Î´c 169.5, which is<br>
characteristic of the lactone functionality in the strained five-membered ring. C-3<br>
was also not found in the aromatic region and was assigned to the methylene<br>
group at Î´c 66.5 attached to the carbonyl forming a lactone. The structure was<br>
confirmed by the &gt;1 JCH correlations observed in a HMBC experiment.<br>
5-Methoxyjusticidin A 3 was previously isolated by Siani et al. from the wood of<br>
Protium unifoliolatum1. In this article, some of the NMR signals were not assigned<br>
correctly (C-9, C-9a, C-8, and C-8a) and we were able to assign them with the aid<br>
of 2D experiments. The author acknowledged the wrong assignment and thus the<br>
assignment we propose can be taken as correct.<br><br><br>
Characterization of justicidin A (4)<br>
This compound was isolated as white amorphous flakes. The 1H NMR spectrum<br>
of 4 was similar to that of 3. The main difference was that the spectrum of 4<br>
exhibits the presence of only three methoxy groups (Î´H 3.79, 4.04, 4.11) instead<br>
of four as for 3. One methoxy at C-5 was replaced by a proton resonating at Î´H<br>
7.52. The absence of observed coupling between the two protons resonating at Î´H<br>
7.52 and 7.04 suggests a para relationship between them. The methylene signal<br>
at ÎH 5.51 which forms part of the furanone ring was still present as was the three<br>
aromatic protons that formed the 1, 3, 4-trisubstituted phenyl group. A pair of<br><br>
proton doublets with very weak coupling (Î´H 6.02 and 6.06 with a JHH value of 0.9<br>
Hz) was observed for the methylenedioxy substituent.<br>
Twenty two 13C NMR signals were observed which is in compliance with one less<br>
methoxy group. The three methoxy groups were assigned at Î´c 55.8, 56.1 and<br>
59.7. A carbonyl signal was observed downfield at Î´c 169.5. The methylene group<br>
forming part of the furanone ring was assigned at Î´c 66.6. The methylenedioxy<br>
carbon signal was found at Î´c 101.2. The rest of the carbon signals were found to<br>
support the structural framework with the same substitution pattern as for 5-<br>
methoxyjusticidin A (3).<br>
Justicidin A (4) showed a molecular ion peak of m/z 395.4 in ESIMS positive<br>
mode corresponding to [M+1]+ and the molecular formula C22H18O7. In the UV<br>
spectrum of this compound as obtained from a diode array detector has a strong<br>
absorption maximum at 261.7 nm. This compound is widely distributed within the<br>
different species of Justicia and it has been widely studied before for antiviral" ,<br>
anti platelet"'â¢ and cytotoxic activity but not for the activity reported here.<br>
Published NMR data for justicidin AVI,V" supported the structural assignment of<br>
justicidin A (4).<br><br><br>
Characterization of chinensinaphthol (5)<br>
Compound 5 is commonly known as chinensinaphthol and it was previously<br>
isolated from Justicia procumbens and tested for antiplatelet properties as<br>
documented by Z. Horii et al 1968.viii<br>
A mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 381.4 observed in LRESIMS in positive mode was<br>
assigned to the molecular ion peak [M+1]+, which is in agreement with the formula<br>
C21H16O7. The UV maximum plot of this compound from the DAD spectrum<br>
showed absorptions at 322.0, 266.4 and 228.8 nm, which is characteristic of aryl<br>
naphthalene molecules.<br><br>
Compound 5 was purified by flash silica gel chromatography and visualization<br>
under long range UV 254 nm gave a purple coloured spot and a very intense blue<br>
fluorescent color when viewed at 366 nm. It was obtained as a white amorphous<br>
substance that could not be re-dissolved in a single solvent only. Thus, it was<br>
dissolved in a mixture of CDCI3 and MeOH-d4 for NMR experiments and the<br>
obtained data are collated in Table 6.3.<br>
1H NMR data showed a singlet at ÎH 5.35 which can be assigned to the lactone<br>
methylene group and a resonance at Î´H 6.15 (s, H-10) that is characteristic of a<br>
methylenedioxy group, and two methoxyl groups appeared as singlets at ÎH 3.71<br>
and 3.84. In the previous two structures (3 and 4), the methylenedioxy groups<br>
were attached to the C ring and the methoxy groups to the A ring. However,&gt;1 JCH<br>
correlations observed in the HMBC experiment, indicated that in this compound,<br>
the methylene group is on the A ring and the methoxy substitutents on the B ring.<br>
The three aromatic C ring protons formed an ABX system characteristic of<br>
trisubstituted phenyl as it was observed for the lignans 3 and 4. These protons<br>
resonated at Î´H 6.83 (H-2\ d, 8.24), 6.77 (H-6\ dd, 2.07 &amp; 8.03), 7.05 (H-5\ d,<br>
8.24) and their coupling was supported by the COSY 2D correlations.<br><br><br>
13C NMR spectra data with 21 carbons supported the proposed structure 5 and<br>
the mass spectrum data obtained. The carbonyl C-1 of the lactone ring and the<br>
methylene group C-3 in the same ring were assigned resonances at Î´c 169.4 and<br>
66.4 respectively. Other important signals were the two methoxy groups that<br>
resonated at Î´c 55.4 and 55.5 and the methylenedioxy C-10 that resonated at Î´c<br>
101.9.<br>
On the basis of the spectral data and the supporting correlations observed in 2D<br>
NMR experiments, compound 3 was identified as chinensinaphthol.<br><br>
Characterization of suchilactone, 6<br>
Crystalline and yellowish 6 was isolated from the methanol-dichloromethane<br>
extract of M. angustifolia and its spectral data is collated in Table 6.4. The<br>
structure was deduced with the help of the 2D NMR correlations that provided<br>
information to the C-H connectivity pattern. The proposed structure was also<br>
confirmed by comparison to literature data lx<br>
ESIMS (+) of compound 6 showed a molecular ion peak of m/z 368 which agrees<br>
with a molecular formula of C21H20O6. In the mass spectrum, fragments were<br>
observed at m/z 151, which was assigned to the fragment 6.1 and at m/z 217<br>
assigned to the fragment 6.2.<br>
Two methoxy groups were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum at ÎH 3.84 and 3.86<br>
as singlets. In contrast to the other compounds where only one 1,3,4-trisubstituted<br>
phenyl ring was observed, in the 1H NMR spectrum of 6, a second set of ABX<br>
protons were present. Additionally, an olefinic proton was observed at Î´H 7.50.<br><br><br><br>
From the COSY correlations it was observed that the protons at H-4 couples with<br>
those protons at positions H- 5 and H-7". These key correlations are shown in Fig<br>
6.4 and they are represented by arrows in red. The other correlations observed<br>
were H-6' to H-4' and H-7' and also in the C ring there was a strong correlation<br>
between H-5" and H6".<br>
The 13C NMR of compound 6 showed 21 carbon signals with two methoxy groups<br>
overlapping at Î´c 55.9. The carbonyl in the lactone ring resonates at Î´c 172.5 and<br>
the methylene group in the same ring appears at Î´c 69.8. The exocyclic double<br>
bond of the lactone ring showed resonance peaks at Î´c 126.1 and 137.2 for the<br>
carbons at C-3 and C-8', respectively. The methylene carbon at C-7" was<br><br>
assigned to the signal at Î´c 37.7. The methylenedioxy group at C-2' showed its<br>
resonance peak at Î´c 101.7. The DEPT spectrum was used to assign the<br>
multiplicity of the carbon resonances. Two overlapping methoxy peaks, three CH2<br>
and eight CH peaks, leaving the remaining eight carbon signals to be assigned as<br>
quaternary carbon atoms.<br>
Characterization of retrochinesinaphthol methyl ether, 7<br>
Compound 7 (C22H18O7) was identified as retrochinesinaphthol methyl ether.x A<br>
mass- charge ratio m/z 395.4 [M+1]+ (ESIMS) was obtained which supports the<br>
molecular formula of C22H18O7. The structure of the compound is similar to that of<br>
5 with the difference that the methylene and the carbonyl groups of the lactone<br>
ring are swopped around and that the hydroxyl group in position C-4 was now<br>
replaced by a methoxy group.<br><br><br><br>
Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of this compound (7) with those reported<br>
in the literaturex and observed for 5 led to the assignment of compound 7 as<br>
retrochinesinaphthol methyl ether.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Plant material from M.angustifolia was oven-dried at 35 - 45Â° (i.e. 40<br>
Â± 5Â°C) to more or less constant mass and then ground, to a particle size of 1 -<br>
2mm, in a hammer mill. A quantity of 408g of dried starting material, after milling,<br>
yielded 352g in the 1 - 2mm particle size range. To 86g of the dried plant<br>
material was added M of de-ionized water to form a mixture which was boiled for<br>
1 hour. The boiled mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, filtered and<br>
freeze-dried for 24 hours to yield 22.16g of brownish fluffy powder, forming an<br>
aqueous extract.<br>
To 266g of similarly dried and ground plant material was added 6t of<br>
a 1:1 by volume methanol/dichloromethane mixture, to form a solvent/plant<br>
material mixture which was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour with<br>
occasional stirring. The solvent/plant material mixture was filtered and the<br>
residual plant material was again similarly extracted using a said 1:1 by volume<br>
methanol/dichloromethane mixture for 1 hour with occasional stirring. The two<br>
filtrates so obtained were combined and evaporated under vacuum at a sub-<br>
atmospheric pressure depending upon atmospheric temperature and moisture<br>
content to leave 27.32g of residue, in the form of a sticky dark-green extract.<br>
An amount of 1.5g of the sticky dark-green methanol/dichloromethane<br>
extract was partitioned into two layers between M of a 9:1 by volume<br>
methanol/water mixture and 500ml of hexane. The hexane layer was separated<br><br>
and the methanol /water mixture evaporated at 40Â°C to obtain 395.8mg of a<br>
sticky greenish fraction, to which water was added up to a total volume of 500ml,<br>
which was then further extracted using a 500ml batch of dichloromethane. This<br>
dichloromethane batch was separated from the water and the water was then<br>
further extracted using a further 500ml batch of dichloromethane which was also<br>
separated from the water, and the water was then finally extracted with a final<br>
500ml batch of dichloromethane which was separated therefrom. The three<br>
batches of dichloromethane separated from the water were combined and<br>
evaporated at 40Â°C to yield 542.6mg of a brownish extract, while the separated<br>
residual water was freeze-dried to yield 473.8mg of a brownish powder.<br>
A quantity of 6g of the sticky dark-green diethyl methanol/dichloromethane<br>
extract was fractionated and purified using flash chromatography (silica gel 60,<br>
Merck, 230 - 400 mesh) and a 1.5:8.5 by volume ethyl acetate/hexane mixture as<br>
eluant to produce 163.6mg of a steroid P-sitosterol and the Compounds 3-7<br>
identified above, which were lignan compounds and which were respectively<br>
produced in quantities of 35 mg (Compound 3), 19.3 mg (Compound 4), 27.2 mg<br>
(Compound 5), 36.4 mg (Compound 6) and 16.5 mg (Compound 7).<br>
Methods were tested for the manufacture of a finished product in a<br>
form which is suitable for use by humans and intended to be used for the<br>
manufacture of a finished dose form. Two methods were used to prepare the<br>
products wherein, in one method, fresh wet plant roots, stems, leaves and flowers<br>
were cut, boiled in water, filtered and dried to a powder by either spray-drying or<br>
freeze-drying. Alternatively the cut plant roots, stems, leaves and flowers were<br>
oven-dried by using an oven set to dry at 35 - 45Â°C (i.e. 40 Â± 5Â°C or by using an<br>
herb dryer. The dried plant parts were ground to granules having a particle size of<br>
at most 6000pm and were thereafter extracted by hot water at about 97Â°C,<br>
filtered and dried to a powder using spray-drying or freeze-drying techniques.<br>
In the extraction of the dried plant material 16.00kg of the stems,<br>
leaves and flowers was cut to 5mm lengths and dried in an herb drier using the<br><br>
drying cycle set forth in Table 6 hereunder. The dry (brownish-green) material<br>
was ground to fine granules (3.38 kg having a particle size of at most 6000um)<br>
and extracted by boiling in 75l of water for an hour. The water was filtered and<br>
the residual plant material was boiled in an additional 75l water for 30 minutes.<br>
The combined filtered water extract (115l) was left to stand overnight in a cold<br>
room. An amount of 500ml of the water extract was freeze-dried for 24 hours to<br>
produce 40.6g of a dry brownish powder. The remaining 114.5l was spray-dried<br>
(see Table 7 hereunder for the spray-drying conditions employed) and produced<br>
804g of dry brownish powder which appeared substantially similar to the 40.6g<br>
freeze-dried sample, both visually and chemically. These two extracts were<br>
compared by HPLC-MS and TLC methods, which showed them to be similar to<br>
each other as well as to the 22.1g of brownish fluffy powder produced by freeze-<br>
drying the aqueous extract described initially.<br>
Table 6: Drying parameters for the herb dryer<br><br>
In the extraction of the fresh wet plant material a combination of the<br>
fresh plant stems, leaves and flowers (5.65 kg) was sliced to 5mm lengths and<br>
boiled in 40l of water for an hour. The water was filtered and the residual plant<br>
material was boiled in additional 40l of water for 30 minutes. The extracts so<br>
obtained were combined and filtered to yield 46.62l of a brownish aqueous extract<br>
in the form of a sap. The sap was left in a cold room overnight. Spray-drying (see<br>
Table 5 hereunder for spray drying conditions) of the sap generated 242g of a<br>
brownish powder. The powder was shown by HPLC-MS and TLC methods to be<br>
similar to the 22.16g of brownish fluffy powder produced by freeze-drying the<br>
aqueous extract described initially, and to the 804g of brownish powder obtained<br>
by spray-drying the aqueous extract of dried plant material described above.<br><br>
Table 7: Spray drying parameters<br><br>
A 6.00g portion of the 804g of powder which was prepared by spray-<br>
drying the aqueous extract of dried plant material as described above was<br>
formulated into twenty effervescent tablets at a dose of 300 mg of the spray-dried<br>
powder/tablet (see Table 8 hereunder for formulation compositions).<br>
Table 8: Ingredients used in the formulation of effervescence tablets<br><br>
A further 6.00g portion of the 804g of powder which was prepared by<br>
spray-drying the aqueous extract of dried plant material as described above was<br>
formulated into twenty capsules each containing 300 mg of the spray-dried<br>
powder. The capsules were produced and contained the ingredients as set forth in<br>
Table 9 hereunder.<br><br>
Table 9: Ingredients used in Capsules formulations<br><br>
To ascertain the efficacy of the invention, the aqueous and organic<br>
extracts described above were tested. A mixture of part of the 22.16g of brownish<br>
fluffy powder initial aqueous extract and part of the 27.32g of sticky dark-green<br>
methanol/dichloromethane extract, prior to the partitioning, was formed by mixing<br>
in a ratio of 4:6 by mass and was tested according to the available in vivo sexual<br>
activity, mating frequency/pregnancy model (MFM). The model is a measure of<br>
male libido. The extract mixture was administered orally to 3 male rats at a dose of<br>
300mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Sexual activity was recorded by video<br>
surveillance during the nocturnal period i.e. from 17h00 to midnight. The vehicle<br>
control substance used was distilled water dosed orally to each animal at a daily<br>
dose of 10ml/kg.<br>
The extract mixture exhibited a significant increase in mating<br>
frequency and the number of pregnant female rats as compared to the vehicle<br>
control, thereby demonstrating increased male libido. The results obtained from<br>
the bioassay are shown in Tables 10 and 11 hereunder.<br><br>
Table 10: Results obtained from the Sexual Activity, Mating frequency<br>
Assay<br>
Table 11: Results obtained from the Sexual Activity, Pregnancy Assay<br><br><br>
In order to establish the possible mode of action of the prepared<br>
extracts for the MFM activity observed in rats, the extracts were also screened in<br>
vitro for inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme. Inhibition of the<br>
phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme limits the hydrolysis of cyclic Guanisine<br>
Monophosphate (cGMP) to acyclic Guanisine Monophosphate (5'GMP) and<br>
thereby increases the intracellular concentrations of cGMP which results in the<br>
relaxation of the corpus carvenosum smooth muscle. When this muscle is relaxed<br>
blood flows and fills the arteries causing the penis to erect.<br>
The aqueous extract and the methanol/dichloromethane extract<br>
whose 4:6 by mass combination was the test substance in Tables 6 and 7 above<br>
were formed into a different combination by mixing in a 1:1 ratio by mass, which<br>
1:1 combination was tested for the in vitro inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5<br>
enzyme. It exhibited a significant (80%) inhibition at 100Î¼g/mf (see Table 12<br>
hereunder).<br><br>
Further in vitro assaying of part of said 27.32g of sticky dark-green<br>
methanol/dichloromethane extract and of part of the 22.16g of brownish fluffy<br>
powder aqueous extract was carried out separately in the phosphodiesterase 5<br>
enzyme inhibition assay to establish which extract contributed most to the activity<br>
of the 1:1 combination. The methane/dichloromethane extract exhibited the<br>
highest inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme (see Table 12). It is also<br>
worth noting that the enzyme inhibition that was observed from the 1:1 by mass<br>
combination was approximately the average of the inhibition observed from the<br>
respective methanol/dichloromethane and aqueous extracts and it is measured<br>
significant (ie. the results are considered to be significant if more than 50%<br>
inhibition is measured).<br>
The assay of the inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme was<br>
carried out by the MDS Pharma Laboratory in Taiwan. Phosphodiesterase 5<br>
enzyme, partially purified from human platelets, was used. Test compounds<br>
and/or vehicles were incubated with 3.5 Î¼g enzyme and 1 Î¼M cGMP containing<br>
0.01 Î¼M [3H]cGMP in Tris buffer at pH 7.5 for 20 minutes at 30Â°C. The reaction<br>
was terminated by boiling for 2 minutes and the resulting GMP was converted to<br>
guanosine by addition of 10 mg/ml snake venom nucleotidase and further<br>
incubation at 30Â°C for 10 minutes. Unhydrolyzed cGMP was bound to AG1-X2<br>
resin, and remaining [3H]guanosine in the aqueous phase was quantitated by<br>
scintillation counting. Compounds were screened at 100 ÎM. Since enzyme<br>
activity could change from lot to lot, the concentration used was adjusted if<br>
necessary.<br>
In order to isolate and identify the active ingredients responsible for<br>
the inhibitory activity against the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme, further<br>
fractionation through liquid-liquid partitioning was conducted on part of the 27.32g<br>
of sticky dark-green methanol/dichloromethane extract. The dichloromethane,<br>
hexane and water fractions obtained therefrom by the partitioning between<br>
methanol/water and hexane and further dichloromethane extraction described<br><br>
above were screened for in vitro phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme inhibition. Only the<br>
dichloromethane fraction resulted in a substantial increase in the inhibition of<br>
phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme relative to the crude plant extracts.<br>
Table 12: Summary of results demonstrating inhibition<br><br>
As the inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme is one of the<br>
mode of actions that may facilitate the relaxation of the corpus carvenosum<br>
smooth muscle, part of the 22.16g of the brownish fluffy powder aqueous extract<br>
and part of the 27.32g of sticky dark-green methanol/dichloromethane extract<br>
were also tested for the relaxation of the pre-contracted rabbit corpus carvernosal<br>
smooth muscle.<br>
Measurement of rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle<br>
relaxation/contraction was assayed by the University of Pretoria Assay<br>
Laboratory in Pretoria, South Africa in accordance with the bioassay as described<br>
by Levin et al. 1997 Journal of Andrology, Volume 18, No. 3, pages 246 - 249<br>
(with some minor changes). Strips (12mm long and 1-2mm thick) of rabbit corpus<br>
carvernosal smooth muscle were dissected and mounted in an organ-bath<br>
chamber containing Krebs-PSS solution with the following composition: NaCI =<br>
7.01 g/l, KCI = 0.34g/l, KH2P04 = 0.1 g/l, NaHC03 = 1.99g/l, CaCI2 = 0.2g/l,<br>
MgS04 = 0.3g/l and glucose = 1.8g/t One end of the muscle was tied to the<br>
inside bottom of the perfusion bath and the other end to a thin wire connected to<br>
a Harvard isotonic force transducer for isotonic tension measurements. Changes<br>
in isotonic tension were recorded on a computerized calibrating program. The<br><br>
corpus cavernosum muscle was perfused with 2ml Krebs-PSS buffered saline<br>
solution and oxygenated with 95% 02 and 5% C02 for 5 minutes to establish a<br>
stable base-line recording. This was followed by perfusion with 2ml of high CaCI2<br>
in Krebs-PSS (17.8 mg/ml) for muscle contraction. Base-line tension was set at<br>
the point of maximal contraction following the addition of CaCI2 into the<br>
experimental bath. The extracts to be analyzed were added after a stable<br>
contraction base-line. The same procedure was repeated for the positive control,<br>
Sildenafil. The contraction/relaxation was reported relative to Sildenafil tested at<br>
78 ng/ml. In these experiments the stimulation frequency used for rabbit strips<br>
was 9 Hz. Both of these extracts demonstrated a potential to relax the rabbit<br>
corpus carvenosum smooth muscle with the aqueous extract demonstrating this<br>
potential more significantly than the methanol/dichloromethane extract (see Table<br>
13 hereunder).<br>
Table 13: Results obtained from the assaying of extracts in the rabbit corpus<br>
carvernosal smooth muscle assay.<br><br>
Although the aqueous extract showed more significant relaxation of<br>
the smooth muscle as compared to the methanol/dichloromethane extract, the<br>
difference was not conclusive. However the latter exhibited a higher<br>
phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme inhibition than the former (see Table 12 above).<br>
The significant phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme activity shown by the<br>
methanol/dichloromethane extract necessitated further investigation, by<br>
chromatographic purification thereof in order to isolate the components<br>
responsible for the observed activity.<br><br>
Fractionation of the methanol/dichloromethane extract resulted in the<br>
isolation of Compounds 3-7, all of which were shown to be lignans as illustrated<br>
above. The five lignans were also shown to be present in the dichloromethane<br>
fraction using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and HPLC methods. These lignans<br>
were screened for phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibition as described above by<br>
MDS Pharma, they were screened as described hereunder for the relaxation of the<br>
pre-contracted rabbit smooth muscle and they were screened as described<br>
hereunder for cytotoxicity against the Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO) the<br>
results of which are summarized in Table 14 hereunder.<br>
Rabbit corpus cavemosum relaxation/contraction was measured by<br>
the MDS Pharma Laboratory. Corpus cavemosum obtained from New Zealand-<br>
derived albino male rabbits weighing 2.5-3 kg and sacrificed by CO2 overexposure<br>
was used. A strip from the basal area of the corpus cavernosal was removed and<br>
placed under 2g tension in a 10 ml bath containing Krebs solution at pH 7.4 at<br>
32Â°C and sub-maximal isometrically recorded tonic contraction was induced by<br>
phenylephrine (3 uM). The test substance (30uM) induced relaxation by 50% or<br>
more (&gt;50%) within 5 minutes, relative to the control 0.3uM sodium nitroprusside<br>
response, indicating significant relaxation.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cell line was assayed against<br>
Chinese hamster ovarian cells by the Assay Laboratory of the Department of<br>
Medicine, Division of Pharmacology, University of Cape Town, South Africa.<br>
Samples of Compounds 3-7 were tested for in vitro cytotoxicity<br>
against the Chinese Hamster Ovarian cell line using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-<br>
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. All samples were tested in<br>
triplicate on a single occasion. The MTT-assay was used as a colorimetric assay<br>
for cellular growth and survival, and compares well with other available assays<br>
(Mosman, Journal of Immunological Methods 65, 55-63 (1983) and Rubinstein et<br>
al., Journal of the National Cancer Institute 82, 1113-8 (1990)). The tetrazolium<br>
salt MTT was used to measure all growth and chemo-ensitivity.<br><br>
Aqueous samples were dissolved in water and organic samples were<br>
dissolved in a methanol: water mixture (1:9) by volume. The initial concentration of<br>
stock solutions was 2mg/ml for all samples. Samples were stored at -20Â°C until<br>
use. The highest concentration of methanol to which the cells were exposed to<br>
had no measurable effect on the cell viability (data not shown). Emetine was used<br>
as the positive control in all experiments. The initial concentration of emetine was<br>
100ug/ml, which was serially diluted in complete medium with 10-fold dilutions to<br>
give 6 concentrations, the lowest being 0.001 Î¼g/mt. The same dilution technique<br>
was applied to all other samples with an initial concentration of 100Î¼g/ml to give 5<br>
concentrations, with the lowest concentration being 0.01 Î¼g/ml.<br>
The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC5o) values for these samples<br>
were obtained from dose-response curves, using a non-linear dose-response<br>
curve fitting analyses via GraphPad Prism v 2.01 software.<br>

tests, Emetine was used as the control with an IC50 value of 0 04Î¼g/ml<br>
Viagra showed 100% relaxation at 18X10~2Î¼g/ml or an IC50 value of 4 1X10'3Î¼M for<br>
phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme inhibition<br>
Significant inhibition was obtained for Compound 7 in the<br>
phosphodiesterase 5 enzymatic assay. Rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle<br>
relaxation was observed for Compounds 3, 5, 6, and 7. The results indicate that,<br><br>
while these compounds demonstrated significant relaxation of the rabbit corpus<br>
cavernosum smooth muscle, their ability to inhibit the phosphodiesterase 5<br>
enzyme was limited (except for Compound 7). This indicates that the Compounds<br>
3, 5, 6 and 7 could act through a different mode of action. In addition the whole<br>
plant extract may act by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme through a<br>
synergistic effect.<br>
The isolated lignan compounds were also tested for cytotoxicity<br>
against the Chinese hamster ovarian cells (Table 14 above) and Emetine was<br>
used as the control with an IC5o value of 0.04Î¼g/ml (values â¤1.0 are considered to<br>
be cytotoxic). The four Compounds 3, 5, 6, and 7 that have relaxation effect on<br>
the pre-contracted rabbit smooth muscle are non-cytotoxic at the test<br>
concentrations with the least toxic being Compounds 6 and 7. The cytotoxic<br>
Compound 3 according to this Chinese hamster ovarian cell test, did not exhibit<br>
any relaxation of the rabbit smooth muscle and demonstrated an insignificant<br>
inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme at the Compounds' test<br>
concentrations. Thus Compounds 3, 5, 6 and 7 have a therapeutic window of<br>
interest based on the evaluated concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Extracts of M.angustifolia were compared with extracts of M.galpinii<br>
and M. brevirostrata to show the presence of compounds (3) - (7) in these plants.<br>
The results are shown in Table 15.<br>
Method of extract preparation:<br>
The dried plant material was ground and successively extracted with methanol-<br>
dichloromethane (1:1, v/v). The solvent was filtered and evaporated to dryness in<br>
a rotary evaporator in vacuo. The generated organic extracts were stored in a cold<br>
room at -20 Â°C when not in use.<br><br>
HPLC analysis:<br>
Sample preparation:<br>
Samples were reconstituted in a 50:50 methanol: acetonitrile mixture, vortexed<br>
for 30 seconds, filtered and injected.<br>
Romil methanol and acetonitrile were used throughout.<br>
HPLC method:<br>

Table 15<br><br>
The present invention can, at least potentially, be regarded as having<br>
the following beneficial properties:<br>
a)	A treatment for the erectile dysfunction as well as for increasing male libido<br>
is provided;<br>
b)	Extracts of the plant that induce the relaxation of the pre-contracted corpus<br>
cavernosum smooth muscle demonstrate a potential treatment for erectile<br>
dysfunction;<br>
c)	Compounds 3, 5, 6, and 7 isolated from the extracts of the plant<br>
demonstrate a potential for the treatment of erectile dysfunction through<br>
relaxation of the pre-contracted corpus cavernosum smooth muscle without<br>
inhibition of the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme, thereby reducing any unwanted<br>
side effects which may occur through the inhibition of this enzyme; and<br>
d)	The extracts and compounds for the treatment of both erectile dysfunction<br>
and for increasing male libido.<br><br>
