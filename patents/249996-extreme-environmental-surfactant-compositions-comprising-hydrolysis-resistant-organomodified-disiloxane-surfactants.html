3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to extreme environment compositions comprising disiloxane surfactant compositions that exhibit resistance to hydrolysis over a wide pH range. More particularly the present invention relates to such extreme environment compositions having a resistance to hydrolysis between a pH of about 3 to a pH of about 12.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The topical application of liquid compositions to the surfaces of both animate and inanimate objects to effect a desired change involve the processes of controlling wetting, spreading, foaming, detergency, and the like. When used in aqueous solutions to improve the delivery of active ingredients to the surface being treated, trisiloxane type compounds have been found to be useful in enabling the control of these processes to achieve the desired effect. However, the trisiloxane compounds may only be used in a narrow pH range, ranging from a slightly acidic pH of 6 to a very mildly basic pH of 7.5. Outside this narrow pH range, the trisiloxane compounds are not stable to hydrolysis undergoing a rapid decomposition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to molecular species and non-integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to a mixture of molecular species on a molecular weight average basis, a number average basis or a mole fraction basis.<br>
The present invention provides for a disiloxane compound or compositions thereof useful as a surfactant having the general formula:<br>
MM'<br>
whence<br>
M = R'R2R3SiOl/2<br>
M' = R4R5R6SiO1/2;<br>

R2 and R3 are each independently selected from the group of from 1 to 6 carbon atom monovalent hydrocarbon radicals or R1, with R4 an alkylpolyalkyleneoxide of the general formula:<br>
where R13 is a divalent linear or branched hydrocarbon radical having the structure:<br>
where R15 is H or methyl; R16 is a divalent alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbons where the subscript d may be 0 or 1;<br>

and R5 and R6 are each independently selected from the group of monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or R4. When the subscript a satisfies the condition 2 
One method of producing the composition of the present invention is to react a molecule of the following formula:<br>
MMH<br>
where MH is the hydride precursor to the M' structural unit in the composition of the present invention, wherein the definitions and relationships are later defined and consistent with those defined above, under hydros ilylation conditions, with an olefinically modified polyalkyleneoxide, such as allyloxypolyethyleneglycol, or methallyloxypolyalkyleneoxide, which are incorporated herein as examples, and not set forth to limit other possible olefinically modified alkyleneoxide components. As used herein the phrase "olefinically modified polyalkyleneoxide" is defined as a molecule possessing one or more alkyleneoxide groups containing one or more, terminal or pendant, carbon-carbon double bonds. The polyether is an olefinically modified polyalkyleneoxide (hereinafter referred to as "polyether") is described by the general formula :<br>

where<br>
R15 is H or methyl; R16 is a divalent alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbons where the subscript d may be 0 or 1; R14 is H, a monofunctional hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbons, or acetyl. When the polyether is composed of mixed oxyalkyleneoxide groups (i.e. oxyethylene, oxypropylene and oxybutylene) the units may be blocked, or randomly distributed. One skilled in the art will understand the advantages of using a blocked or random configuration.   Illustrative  examples of  blocked configurations are: -<br>
Illustrative examples of the polyether are provided below, but not limited to:<br><br>
Polyether modified siloxanes are prepared in the normal manner through the use of a hydrosilylation reaction to graft the olefinically modified (i.e. vinyl, allyl or methallyl) polyalkyleneoxide onto the hydride (SiH) intermediate of the disiloxane of the present invention.<br>
Precious metal catalysts suitable for making polyether-substituted siloxanes are also well known in the art and comprise complexes of rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, osmium, iridium, or platinum. Many types of platinum catalysts for this SiH olefin addition reaction are known and such platinum catalysts may be used to generate the compositions of the present invention. The platinum compound can be selected from those having the formula (PtCbOlefin) and H(PtCl301efin) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,159,601, hereby incorporated by reference. A further platinum containing material can be a complex of chloroplatinic acid with up to 2 moles per gram of platinum of a member selected from the class consisting of alcohols, ethers, aldehydes and mixtures thereof as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,972 hereby incorporated by reference. Yet another group of platinum containing materials useful in this present invention is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,715,334; 3,775,452 and 3,814,730 (Karstedt). Additional background concerning the art may be found in J. L. Spier, "Homogeneous Catalysis of Hydrosilation by Transition Metals", in Advances in Organometallic Chemistry, volume 17, pages 407 through 447, F.G.A- Stone and R. West editors, published by Academic Press (New York, 1979). Those skilled in the art can easily determine an effective amount of platinum catalyst. Generally an<br>
5<br><br>
effective amount ranges from about 0.1 to 50 parts per million of the total organomodified disiloxane composition.<br>
The compositions as well as the siloxanes of the present invention exhibit an enhanced resistance to hydrolysis outside a pH range ranging from 6 to 7.5, i.e. in extreme environmental conditions. An extreme environment is defined as an aqueous solution pH below 6 or above 7.5 or non-aqueous equivalents in terms of Bronsted acidity or basicity or Lewis acidity ort basicity. Enhanced resistance to hydrolysis can be demonstrated by a variety of tests but as used herein enhanced resistance to hydrolysis means 50 mole percent or more of the hydrolysis resistant composition of the present invention remains unchanged or unreacted after a period of a twenty-four exposure to aqueous acidic conditions where the solution has a pH lower than 6 or after a period of a twenty-four hour exposure to aqueous basic conditions where the solution has a pH greater than 7.5. Under acidic conditions the compositions of the present invention show a survival of 50 mole percent of the original concentration or greater at a pH of 5 or less for a period of time in excess of 48 hours; specifically the compositions of the present invention show a survival of 50 mole percent or greater at a pH of 5 or less for a period of time in excess of 2 weeks; more specifically the compositions of the present invention show a survival of 50 mole percent or greater at a pH of 5 or less for a period of time in excess of 1 month; and most specifically the compositions of the present invention show a survival of 50 mole percent or greater at a pH of 5 or less for a period of time in excess of 6 months.

Example 8<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the organomodified disiloxane composition of the present invention to reduce aqueous surface tension thereby showing utility as surfactants. Surface tension was measured using a Kruss surface tensiometer, with a sand blasted platinum blade as the sensor. Solutions of the various components were prepared at 0.1 wt% in Q.0Q5M NaCl water (Deionized), as an equilibrium aid.<br>
Table 4 shows that solutions of these unique compositions provide a significant reduction in surface tension relative to the conventional surfactant.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also provide spreading properties similar to the TSAs (E and F), and comparative disiloxane surfactants (A, B, C, D and H). Additionally, organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention provide improved spreading relative to the conventional silicone poly ether (G) and conventional organic surfactant product OPE (Table 4).<br>
Spreading was determined by applying a 10 pL droplet, of surfactant solution to polyacetate film (USI, "Crystal Clear Write on Film") and measuring the spread diameter (mm) after 30 seconds, at a relative humidity between 50 and 70% (at 22 to 25Â°C). The solution was applied with an automatic pipette to provide droplets of reproducible volume. Deionized water that was further purified with a Millipore filtration system was used to prepare the surfactant solutions.<br>

Tables 6-16 demonstrates that the compositions of the present invention provide improved resistance to hydrolytic decomposition relative to the standard comparative siloxane-based surfactants siloxanes B and E under similar pH conditions.<br>
Comparative siloxanes B and E show rapid hydrolysis at  pH 7, while the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention demonstrate a higher resistance to hydrolysis under the same conditions.<br>
Although comparative D shows similar resistance to hydrolysis, it does not provide the enhanced, spreading properties associated with the organomodified disiloxane<br>

surfactants of the present invention. For example comparative D gave a spread diameter of only 6 mm (0.4%) and had 82% product remaining by HPLQ after 48h at pH4, while the organomodified disiloxane surfactant product 10 gave a spread diameter of 34 mm and maintained 75% product after lweek, under the same conditions (Tables 4,11 and 16).<br>

Unlike traditional siloxane based surfactants, which are subject to rapid hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions (<ph and> pH 9) the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention provide increased resistance to hydrolysis relative to traditional trisiloxane alkoxylates (Comparative E and F), as well as the comparative trimethylsilyl terminated disiloxane surfactants, represented by Comparative B. An artifact of hydrolysis is observed as a reduction in superpsreading properties over time. Therefore solutions of the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention, as well as comparative surfactants were prepared at desired use levels and pH. Spreading was determined as a function of time to illustrate resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
Example 10<br>
Table 17 is an illustrative example of the organomodified disiloxane surfactants, where product No. 10, has improved resistance to hydrolysis, at pH 3, relative to a traditional trisiloxane ethoxylate superspreading surfactant (Product E). As mentioned above, resistance to hydrolysis was observed by monitoring the spreading properties over time. Here a 0.4 wt% solution was prepared at pH 3, and spreading determined according to the procedure in Example 8.<br>

The impact of other ingredients on spreading was determined by blending the organosilicone disiloxane surfactant of the present invention, with a conventional organic based cosurfactant. The cosurfactants are described in Table 20.<br>
Blends were prepared as physical mixtures where the weight fraction silicone is represented by a (alpha), indicating that the cosurfactant makes up the balance of the blend ratio. For example when a = 0 this indicates that the composition contains 0% of the silicone component and 100% cosurfactant, while an a = 1.0 indicates the composition contains 100% silicone, and no (0%) cosurfactant. Mixtures of the two components are represented by the weight fraction a, where a ranges as follows: 0 
25<br><br>
Spreading was determined as described in Example 8, at either 0.1 wt% or 0.2wt% total surfactant.<br>
Table 21 demonstrates that representative examples of the cosurfactants of the present invention provide favorable spreading results, and in some cases provide an unexpected synergistic enhancement, where the spread diameter of the mixture exceeds that of the individual components.<br>
