Polymeric material, containing a latent acid<br>
The present application relates to polymeric material containing a latent acid, i.e. a compound which is not an acid but which can be converted to an acid by the influence of irradiation.<br>
For specific technical applications, compositions are requested containing compounds which are capable of reacting with acids, however, such a reaction should be suppressed until a predetermined moment. It is common practice in such cases to separate the compounds and the acids by suitable measures, e.g. by encapsulating them into coverings and destroying these coverings when reaction is desired. This method is, however, not practicable in many cases.<br>
The present application describes an elegant solution for that problem by using not acids but latent acids. Thus the compounds capable of reacting with acids can be intimately mixed with the latent acids without reaction. No covering material is required. At the desired moment reaction can easily be achieved by irradiating the mixture in a suitable manner to convert the latent acid into the acid, which then reacts with the compound.<br>
The present application concerns polymeric material, containing a latent acid, which can be converted to an acid by irradiation and optionally further ingredients.<br>
As latent acids compounds are suitable which are not acids per se and contain a proton, which can be split off by irradiation.<br>

The polymeric material can also be a mixture of two or more different polymers.<br>
The polymeric material usually contains preferably 0,001 to 10% by weight, most preferably 0,01 to 5% by weight of the latent acid (1). The polymeric material may also contain mixtures of two or more of the latent acids.<br>
The polymeric material and the latent acid usually form a homogenous mixture. For specific applications, however, compositions can be made in which the latent acid is enriched in a specific part of the polymeric material, e.g. in the surface areas.<br>
The methods for incorporating the latent acid into the polymeric material are in principle known. It is e.g. possible, to dissolve the components in a solvent and then to remove the solvent by evaporation. Another possibility is to melt polymeric material together with the latent acid to get a homogeneous mixture or to thoroughly knead a mixture of polymeric material and latent acid, or to polymerize the corresponding monomers in the presence of the latent acid.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the latent acid (1) is grafted on the polymer material by means known in the art. E.g. the latent acid (1) is converted into a monomer, i.e. by incorporating a functional polymerizable group, or a monomer is used which is functionalized with a latent acid group. This allows a graft polymerization on the existing polymeric material or a copolymerization during the manufacturing the polymeric material.<br><br>

The polymeric material usually may contain further ingredients, e. g. stabilizers, antioxidants, softeners etc. as are commonly used for polymeric material.<br>
To convert the latent acid into the corresponding acid, the polymeric material is irradiated. Irradiation in this application especially means irradiation with UV-light and especially with UV-lasers. As a rule, the lasers used are commercially available. The wavelength of the UV-light preferably is chosen in the range of 285 to 400 nm, particularly preferred in the range of 285 to 370 nm. The duration of irradiation depends on the components and on the type of UV-source and be easily be determined by simple experiments.<br>
&gt;	The inventive polymeric material containing a latent acid can be used in a system for laser<br>
decoration if the polymeric material additionally contains a colourless colour former which gives a visible colour after reaction with an acid.<br>
The following non-limitative examples illustrate the invention in more detail. Parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: To a reaction flask are charged 16.7 g of mercaptobenzothiazole, 16.4 g 2-t-butyl-5-methylphenol, 3.0 g paraformaldehyde and 1 ml dibutylamine. The mixture is heated to 120°C and held at this temperature for 6 hours. After cooling to room temperature 75 ml ethanol are added. Then the mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hours and then cooled to 20°C and filtered. By trituration of the product with hot methanol a product with melting point 177.9-183.9°C is obtained. The product is of the following formula:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
