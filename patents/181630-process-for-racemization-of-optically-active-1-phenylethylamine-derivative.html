It has been found by the intensive study of the present inventors that, according to the process, the racemization reaction of optically active l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethylamine does not proceed at all and the process can not be applied for racemization of optically active 1-phenylethylamines having a substituent at the ortho-position.<br>
On the other hand, as a process of converting optically active 1-phenylethylamines into a corresponding inline and then racemizing the imine, a process of dehydration-condensing optically active l-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylamine with acetophenone, followed by reacting with potassium tert-butoxide has hitherto been described in Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 7-188120. This process had a problem that a large amount of an undesirable amine is formed as a by-product after hydrolysis because isomerization {migration of double bond) of the imine proceeds simultaneously on racemization reaction. Means for solving the Problems<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied about an useful process for racemization of an optically active 1-phenylethylamine derivative having ="bstituent(s) at the ortho-position, which is represented by<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R2 represents an	.	-optionally  substituted<br>
alkyl group  or   an optionally substituted phenyl  group to<br>
form an  optically active imine represented by the formula<br>
(3)   t	 <br>
Wherein R    and R    are as  defined  above,  reacting the imine with  an  alkaline metal tert-alkoxide in   an  aprotic polar solvent  or  a mixture  of the  aprotic polar  solvent and  an aprotic nonpolar  solvent,   and then hydrolyzing  by known means the resultant racemic imine to yield  a racemic  '1-phenylethylamine derivative of formula I.<br>
In the  above  formulas.(1)   and   (3),   one preferred embodiment of R    is  a group represented by the formula (4)   :<br><br><br>
wherein X represents a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine atom, etc.) or a lower alkyl group (e.g. C1-C4 alkyl group such as methyl group, etc.), and Y represents a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine atom, etc.), a lower alkyl group (e.g. C1-C4, alkyl group such as methyl group, etc.) or a hydrogen atom]. More preferred embodiment of Rx is a 2,4-dichlorophenyl group. In the above formulas [2] and [3], one preferred embodiment of R! is a lower alkyl group (e.g. C3-C6,, alkyl group such as tert-butyl group, isopropyl group, isobutyl group, etc.).<br>
The present invention also provides an optically active or racemic imine compound represented by the formula [5]:<br><br>
wherein R21 represents a lower alkyl group (e.g. C1-C4 alkyl group such as tert-butyl group, isopropyl group, isobutyl group, etc. ].<br>
According to the process of the present invention, formation of a compound represented by the formula [6]:<br><br><br>
wherein Rl and R3 are as defined above, which is an isomerizea product wherein a double bond of the optically active imine of the above formula [3] is migrated, can be inhibited and, therefore, formation of an amine as the by-product represented by the formula [7]:<br>
R3-CH2-NH2	[7]<br>
wherein R2 is as defined above which is obtained by hydrolyzing the isomerized product [6] can  be inhibited. Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>

An amount, of the aprotic polar solvent used is normally from 0.5 to 2 parts by weight, based on 1 part by weight of the optically active imine of the formula [3). It is advantageous to use a mixture of the aprotic polar solvent and the aprotic nonpolar solvent as the solvent and to use an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent as the aprotic nonpolar solvent from the industrial point of view.<br>
The reaction temperature and reaction time vary depending on the kind or amount of the alkaline metal tert-alkoxide and kind or amount of the solvent.

for the reaction 3, for example, after the aprotic polar solvent and the like is removed from the reaction mixture by washing with water or an aqueous solution containing an inorganic salt such as sodium chloride. For example, the racemic imine may be used for the reaction 3 after it was isolated by low-boiling fraction distillation or the like, or it may be used for the reaction 3 after it was optionally purified by means such as distillation, recrystallization, various chromatographies and the like.<br>
Next, the reaction 3 will be explained in detail. The reaction 3 can be conducted under a normal hydrolysis reaction condition, and one embodiment thereof is as follows.<br>

In the reaction, an organic solvent may be used. When using the organic solvent, the organic solvent may be any one which does not inhibit the reaction. Examples thereof include alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol and the like; aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane and the<br><br>
ike; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloroethane,<br>
ihloroform and the like; ester solvents such as ethyl acetate<br>
tnd the like; ether solvents such as diethyl ether,<br>

The reaction time is normally within the range from about 10 minutes to 5 hours.<br>
When the reaction 3 is conducted, for example, in the presence of acids, a water-soluble salt of a racemate of the 1-phenylethylamine derivative of the formula [1] and acids, and the aldehyde compound of the formula [2] are formed. When using no organic solvent, the objective racemate of the 1-phenylethylamine derivative of the formula [ 1J , can be isolated by adding a water-insoluble solvent to the reaction solution after the completion of the reaction to extract and isolate the aldehyde compound of the formula [2], and other impurities in the organic layer, alkalifying the aqueous layer with an aqueous alkaline solution such as aqueous sodium hydroxide<br><br>
solution and the like, extracting this with a water-insoluble solvent and then concentrating the resultant organic layer under reduced pressure. When using a water-soluble solvent such as alcohol solvent and the like, the treatment is conducted according to the same manner as that described above, after distilling off the water-soluble solvent. When using a water in-soluble solvent, the treatment may be conducted according to the same manner as that described above except that the reaction mixture is partitioned as it is to extract the aldehyde compound of the formula [2] in the organic layer. Theobjective derivative can also be isolated by steam-distilling the reaction mixture to isolate the aldehyde compound of the formula [2] and other non-basic organic impurities, alkalifying the resultant mass with an aqueous alkaline solution such as aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and the like, extracting this with a water-insoluble solvent and then concentrating the resultant organic layer under reduced pressure.<br>
In the above post-treatment, the aldehyde compound of the formula [21 extracted in the organic layer or aldehyde compound distilled and removed from the reaction solution can be optionally isolated from impurities using an operation such as distillation and the like and reused in the reaction 1.
