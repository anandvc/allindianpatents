[0005]     Other aspects and features of the invention will become apparent from<br>
review of the detailed description and the claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] In an embodiment, the organic ammonium halide precursor comprises one<br>
or more compounds represented by the formula N(R)4X, where X is a halide and<br>
where R represents a hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted carbon chain<br>
molecule having 1-20 carbons wherein each R may be the same or different. In an<br>
embodiment, R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,<br>
and combinations thereof, more specifically methyl. Examples of suitable organic<br>
ammonium precursor is represented by the formula N(R)4X include<br>
tetraalkylammonium halides such as tetramethylammonium chloride,<br>
tetramethylammonium fluoride, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium<br>
fluoride, tetrapropylammonium chloride, tetrapropylammonium fluoride,<br>
tetrabutylammonium	chloride,	tetrabutylammonium	fluoride,<br>
methyltriethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylammonium fluoride, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0007] In an embodiment, the organic ammonium halide precursor comprises at<br>
least one acid halide and at least one ammonium hydroxide represented by the<br>
formula N(R')4OH, where R1 is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted carbon<br>
chain molecule having 1-20 carbon atoms wherein each R' may be the same or<br>
different. In an embodiment, R' is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, butyl, and combinations thereof, more specifically methyl. Examples of<br>
suitable ammonium hydroxide represented by the formula N(R')4OH include<br>
ammonium hydroxide, tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as<br>
tetramethylammonium	hydroxide,	tetraethylammonium	hydroxide,<br><br>
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable acid halides include HCI, HF, HBr, HI, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0008] In an embodiment the organic ammonium halide precursor comprises (a) as described previously, a compound represented by the formula N(R)4X, where X is a halide and where R represents a hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted carbon chain molecule having 1-20 carbons wherein each R may be the same or different and (b) as described previously, at least one acid halide and at least one ammonium hydroxide represented by the formula N(R')4OH, where R' is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted carbon chain molecule having 1-20 carbon atoms wherein each R1 may be the same or different.<br>
[0009] The halide precursor may further comprise an ammonium halide such as ammonium chloride, ammonium fluoride, or both in various combinations with the organic ammonium halide precursor compounds described previously. More specifically, ammonium chloride, ammonium fluoride, or both may be used with (a) as described previously, a compound represented by the formula N(R)4X, where X is a halide and where R represents a hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted carbon chain molecule having 1-20 carbons wherein each R may be the same or different and/or (b) as described previously, at least one acid halide and at least one organic ammonium hydroxide represented by the formula N(R')4OH, where R' is a substituted or unsubstituted carbon chain molecule having 1-20 carbon atoms wherein each R' may be the same or different. For example, a first fluoride or chloride precursor can be introduced as a tetraalkylammonium halide with a second fluoride or chloride precursor introduced as an ammonium halide. In an embodiment, tetraalkylammonium chloride is used with ammonium fluoride. [0010] Supports for aromatizaton catalysts can generally include any inorganic oxide. These inorganic oxides include bound large pore aluminosilicates (zeolites), amorphous inorganic oxides and mixtures thereof. Large pore aluminosilicates include, but are not limited to, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, mordenite and the like. Amorphous inorganic oxides include, but are not limited to, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide and titania. Suitable bonding agents for the inorganic oxides include, but are not limited to, silica, alumina, clays, titania and magnesium oxide.<br><br>
#011] Zeolite materials, both natural and synthetic, are known to have catalytic properties for many hydrocarbon processes. Zeolites typically are ordered porous crystalline aluminosilicates having structure with cavities and channels interconnected by channels. The cavities and channels throughout the crystalline material generally can be of a size to allow selective separation of hydrocarbons. [0012] The term "zeolite" generally refers to a particular group of hydrated, crystalline metal aluminosilicates. These zeolites exhibit a network of SiCU and AIO4 tetrahedra in which aluminum and silicon atoms are crosslinked in a three-dimensional framework by sharing oxygen atoms. In the framework, the ratio of oxygen atoms to the total of aluminum and silicon atoms is equal to 2. The framework exhibits a negative electrovalence which typically is balanced by the inclusion of cations within the crystal such as metals, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals or hydrogen.<br>
[0013] L-type zeolite catalysts are a sub-group of zeolitic catalysts. Typical L-type zeolites contain mole ratios of oxides in accordance with the following formula:<br>
M .2/nO« Al .2O3«xSiO2«yH .2O<br>
wherein "M" designates at least one exchangeable cation such as barium, calcium, cerium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, strontium, and zinc as well as non-metallic cations like hydronium and ammonium ions which may be replaced by other exchangeable cations without causing a substantial alteration of the basic crystal structure of the L-type zeolite. The "n" in the formula represents the valence of "M", "x" is 2 or greater; and "y" is the number of water molecules contained in the channels or interconnected voids with the zeolite.<br>
[0014] Bound potassium L-type zeolites, or KL zeolites, have been found to be particularly desirable. The term KL zeolite as used herein refers to L-type zeolites in which the principal cation M incorporated in the zeolite is potassium. As used in this application, a KL zeolite is one that has not been significantly cation-exchanged or impregnated with another metal unless the term KL zeolite is preceded by a modifier such as "platinum-impregnated" or the zeolite explicitly is referred to as a "KL supported Pt zeolite catalyst."<br>
[0015] The platinum precursor can be any decomposable platinum compound. Examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, ammonium tetrachloroplatinate,    chloroplatinic    acid,    diammineplatinum    (II)    nitrite,    bis-<br><br>
t<br>
(ethylenediamine)platinum (II) chloride, platinum (II) acetylacetonate, dichlorodiammine platinum, platinum (II) chloride, tetraammineplatinum (II) hydroxide, tetraammineplatinum chloride, and tetraammineplatinum (II) nitrate. [0016] In an embodiment, a method for making an aromatization catalyst composition comprises the following steps: (1) predrying large pore zeolite support; (2) treating the zeolite support by impregnating the support with platinum and halide precursors; (3) optionally aging the impregnated support; (4) optionally drying the support; and (5) calcining the support.<br>
[0017] Prior to impregnation, the zeolite support typically is dried under flowing or stationary gas selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, air, helium, nitrogen, argon, and mixtures thereof. As an example, in some cases the gas can be air, and the drying can be performed from about 1 minute to about 20 hours and at a temperature from about 100° to about 600° C. Impregnation of the halide and platinum precursors into the zeolite support may be performed by any suitable method as known to those skilled in the art, such as insipient wetness. [0018] In some embodiments, it may be desirable to age the impregnated catalyst support. This aging can be performed at temperatures from about subambient to about 200°C, at pressures from about ambient to about 500 psig for periods of time from about 1 minute to about 10 days and under conditions where the impregnated solid is stationary or moving. Ambient conditions are defined as environmental temperature at atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0019] In some embodiments, it may be desirable to dry the impregnated catalyst support. The drying generally occurs in the presence of a gas, which can be air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or any inert gas, or mixtures thereof. As an example, it may be desirable to dry the impregnated catalyst in the presence of a gas comprising nitrogen and/or oxygen, for example enriched air or diluted air, such that it contains from about 0.1 vol % to about 100 vol % nitrogen, alternatively from about 0.1 vol % to about 60 vol % nitrogen, alternatively from about 0.1 vol % to about 30 vol % nitrogen. In an embodiment, the gas is a mixture of air and nitrogen. This drying can be performed at temperatures from about 0° to about 300°C, alternatively from about 25° to about 250°C, alternatively from about 50° to about 200°C, and at pressures from about 0.01 mmHg to about 500 psig, alternatively from about 0.01 mmHg to about 50 psig, alternatively from about 0.01 mmHg to about 5 psig,<br><br>
alternatively at subambient pressure, also referred to as vacuum drying; for periods of time from about 1 minute to about 20 hours; under conditions where the gas is stationary or moving; and under conditions where the impregnated solid is either stationary or moving. During the drying step, the temperature can be optionally increased from ambient temperature to the desired drying temperature in a controlled manner, preferably through a series of temperature increases followed by temperature hold periods. The drying step may be carried out in any suitable drying equipment, for example a rotary drier.<br>
[0020] In some embodiments, it may be desirable to calcine the impregnated catalyst support. The calcination generally occurs in the presence of a gas, which can be air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or any inert gas, or mixtures thereof. As an example, it may be desirable to calcine in the presence of a gas comprising nitrogen and/or oxygen, for example enriched air or diluted air, such that it contains from about 0.1 vol % to about 100 vol % oxygen, alternatively from about 1 vol % to about 80 vol % oxygen, alternatively from about 5 vol % to about 60 vol % oxygen. In an embodiment, the gas is a mixture of air and nitrogen, for example having a volume ratio air to nitrogen of from about 1:1 to about 1:3. The calcination step can be performed at temperatures from about 50° to about 600°C, alternatively from about 160° to about 550°C, alternatively from about 275° to about 500°C; under pressures from ambient to 500 psig; for periods of time from about 1 minute to about 100 hours; under conditions where the gas is stationary or moving; and under conditions were the impregnated catalyst support is stationary or moving. During the calcination step, the temperature is increased from ambient temperature in a controlled manner, preferably through a series of temperature increases followed by temperature hold periods. The calcining step may be carried out in any suitable calcining equipment, for example a rotary calciner or a belt conveyed calciner. [0021] In an embodiment, a KL-zeolite supported platinum aromatization catalyst is prepared by impregnating a KL-zeolite-support with tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), and/or tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF), and tetraamineplatinum chloride (TAPC); and calcinating the impregnated zeolite. In an embodiment, a KL-zeolite supported platinum aromatization catalyst is prepared by impregnating a KL-zeolite-support with ammonium fluoride, tetramethylammonium<br><br>
chloride (TMAC), and tetraamineplatinum chloride (TAPC); and calcinating the impregnated zeolite.<br>
[0022] In another aspect, the invention provides a process for reforming a hydrocarbon, for example aromatization, isomerization, dehydrogenation, and combinations thereof. For example, such a process could include contacting a hydrocarbon stream with a catalyst as described herein under suitable reaction conditions for aromatization of hydrocarbons, for example a temperature in the range of about 800° F to about 1050° F. In an embodiment, hydrogen is recovered as a product from the reforming process. In an embodiment, the catalyst comprises a composition made according to one of the methods described herein. [0023] In some embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a catalyst having less than about 1.3 wt% chlorine, alternatively less thpn about 1.0 wt% chlorine, alternatively less than about 0.5 wt% chlorine. In other embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a catalyst having less than about 1.3 wt% fluorine, alternatively less than about 1.0 wt% fluorine, alternatively less than about 0.5 wt% fluorine. Similarly, in other embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a catalyst having less than about 1.0 wt% platinum, alternatively less than about 0.6 wt% platinum, alternatively from about 0.2 to about 0.7 wt% platinum. In various embodiments, the atomic ratio of Pt : F : Cl in the catalyst is from about 1-0.5 : 3.3-1.7 : 10-5, respectively. As an example, the amount of fluorine, chlorine, and/or platinum in the catalyst can be controlled by controlling the amount of the respective precursors in the impregnation treatment.<br>
[0024] In various embodiments, the catalyst composition comprises less than or equal to about 1 wt% platinum and has a Teo temperature of less than about 960°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 2.4 °F/day, alternatively a T6o temperature of less than about 935°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 1.5 °F/day.<br>
[0025] In various embodiments, the catalyst composition comprises less than or equal to about 0.5 wt% platinum and has a T6o temperature of less than about 1010°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 36 °F/day, alternatively a T60 temperature of less than about 965°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 3.5 °F/day, alternatively a T6o temperature of less than about 935°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 1.2 °F/day.<br><br>
1	I<br>
[0026] In various embodiments, the catalyst composition comprises less than or equal to about 0.3 wt% platinum and has a T6o temperature of less than about 972°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 11.4 °F/day, alternatively a T6o temperature of less than about 950°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 1.5 °F/day, alternatively a T6o temperature of less than about 935°F and/or a deactivation rate of less than about 1.2 °F/day. The T60 temperature is defined as the temperature for a given feedstock at which the sum of the benzene wt% and toluene wt% in the reactor effluent is 60 wt%. Once this conversion rate is achieved at T6o, the deactivation rate is defined as a degree increase in temperature per day to maintain this conversion rate.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0027] In each of the following examples, the prepared catalysts were ground, sieved to 20-40 mesh, and placed in a reactor comprising a metal reactor vessel in a temperature controlled furnace. After reducing the catalyst under flowing hydrogen, a feed stream of aliphatic hydrocarbon and hydrogen was introduced to the reactor vessel at a feed rate of 22mL/min and a pressure of 50 psig to obtain performance data. The reactor effluent composition was analyzed by gas chromatography to indicate the amount of benzene and toluene.<br>
[0028] The catalysts prepared in accordance with Examples 1-11 below illustrate effects of varying the amount of platinum impregnated into the KL-zeolite catalyst when compared to Aromax® II catalyst. Under the present invention, significantly lower T6o values and deactivation rates can be obtained by preparing KL supported Pt zeolite catalysts using TMAF in place of NH4F and using a tetraalkylammonium chloride in place of NH4CI.

[0040] The results in Table 1 demonstrate that the substitution of TMAF and TMAC for NH4F and NH4CI, respectively, significantly decreases the deactivation rate and/or the T6o value. Example 1 used an impregnation comprising TAPC, TMAC and TMAF and produced a 1.0 wt% Pt. When compared to the Aromax® II catalyst, there was a 24° F reduction in the T6o value. By reducing the amount of platinum from 1.0 wt% to 0.5 wt%, as shown in the comparison of Examples 2 and 3, the catalyst made using TAPC, NH4F and NH4CI (Example 2) had a 75° F increase in the T6o value and a significant increase in the deactivation rate when compared to the Aromax® II catalyst which contained 1 wt% platinum.<br>
[0041] While the catalyst containing 0.5 wt% platinum made by using TAPC, TMAF and TMAC (Example 3) did not show improvement over the Aromax® II catalyst with respect to the T6o value or the deactivation rate, the catalyst was a significant improvement over Example 2 which is an Aromax® II type catalyst, but containing 0.5 wt% platinum.<br>
[0042] Examples 4 and 6 show the differences between Aromax® II catalyst and an Aromax® II type catalyst containing 0.3 wt% platinum and a catalyst prepared using TAPC, TMAF and TMAC containing 0.3 wt% platinum. The Aromax® II type catalyst (Example 4) showed a significant increase in the T6o value and in the deactivation rate when compared to the Aromax® II catalyst (comparison) and a platinum-impregnated KL-zeolite catalyst of the invention made in accordance with<br>
Example 6.<br>
[0043]     Example 4 and 5 show the differences between an Aromax® II type<br>
catalyst containing 0.3 wt% platinum and a catalyst prepared using TAPC, NH4F,<br><br>
and TMAC containing 0.3 wt% platinum. The Aromax® II type catalyst (Example 4)<br>
showed a significant increase in the deactivation rate when compared to the<br>
platinum-impregnated KL-zeolite catalyst of the invention made in accordance with<br>
Example 5.<br>
[0044]     Examples 7-11 show improved T6o values and lower deactivation rates<br>
than comparative Example 4 when TMAF was substituted for NH4F.   Examples 8<br>
and 9 show the effects of fluorine and chlorine loading, as shown in more detail<br>
below.<br>
10045]	Examples 3, 12, 13, and 14 in Table 2 illustrate effects on T6o value<br>
and the deactivation rate when the amount of chlorine in the catalyst is varied.<br>
Examples 12,13, and 14 were prepared as follows:<br>

The mixture is impregnated into the KL-zeolite and then allowed to stand for 20 hours at ambient temperature.

to stand for 20 hours at ambient temperature. The impregnated KL-zeolite is dried in a vacuum for 2 hours at 170°C and then calcined at 300°C for another 2 hours.<br><br>
[0049] Table 2 is a comparison of changes in the chlorine content of catalyst prepared using TAPC, TMAF and TMAC. The results demonstrate a progressively lower deactivation rate and T6o value as chlorine levels are reduced. Example 2 demonstrates that a poor T6o value and deactivation rate are obtained when the impregnate comprises NH4F and NH4CI instead of TMAF and TMAC.

See comparative Examples 2 and 4 in Table 1. [0062] Table 4 is a comparison of changes in the fluorine impregnating agent used to prepare the catalyst.<br>

[0068] The T6o and deactivation rate data for the catalysts prepared in accordance with Examples 24 - 28 is summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br>
[0069] The results of Table 4 show that satisfactory T6o values and low deactivation rates can be obtained by using a TAPC, TMAC and ammonium fluoride impregnate to prepare the catalyst on a KL-zeolite support (Example 28).
