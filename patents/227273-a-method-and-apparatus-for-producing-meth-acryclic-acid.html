				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE. INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a method for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid performing a step of discarding part of<br>
the exhaust gas of an absorption column and recycling the<br>
remainder to a reactor and a step of separating a condensable<br>
substance exclusively from the recycling gas, and/or a method<br>
for producing (meth)acrylic acid comprising a step of<br>
decreasing the water content entrained in a molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas supplied to the reactor, thereby<br>
enhancing an absorption efficiency of (meth)acrylic acid.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
Commercial production of acrylic acid generally resorts<br>
to the method of propylene oxidation which consists in<br>
subjecting propylene and/or acrolein to catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation. When acrylic acid is produced by this method of<br>
propylene oxidation, the step of propylene oxidation gives<br>
rise to such impurities as water, acids like propionic acid,<br>
acetic acid, and maleic acid, and aldehydes like acrolein,<br>
furfural, and formaldehyde and ketoses like acetone, in the<br>
form of by-products. The gas containing these by-products<br>
is absorbed as an acrylic acid-containing solution generally<br>
via contact with an absorption solvent. This solution is<br>
subsequently purified by separating the absorption solvent<br>
by such a means as distillation and further separating low<br>
boiling substances and high boiling substances. The minute<br>
amount of such impurities as aldehydes which cannot be easily<br>
separated by distillation is possibly purified by a chemical<br>
treatment or a process of crystallization. The purification<br><br>
to a high degree necessitates many steps and complicates<br>
equipment and operation and forms one cause for degrading<br>
the yield of acrylic acid.<br>
One known method, for example, produces acrylic acid<br>
of high purity by absorbing an acrylic acid-containing gas<br>
resulting from catalytic gas phase oxidation with a high<br>
boiling solvent, distilling the solvent now entraining the<br>
gas thereby separating it into the solvent and crude acrylic<br>
acid, and subsequently subjecting the crude acrylic acid to<br>
a process of crystallization (JP-A-1997-227445) . This<br>
method, however, forms a complicated procedure which<br>
comprises a step of cooling an acrylic acid-containing gas<br>
with a venturi, then subjecting the cooled gas to a step of<br>
absorption and subsequently to a step of removing low boiling<br>
substances, thereafter a step of separating the residue in<br>
a distillation column into a high boiling substance and a<br>
medium boiling substance, and a step of extracting crude<br>
acrylic acid from the intermediate stage of the column.<br>
If an acrylic acid solution having a high concentration<br>
is successfully treated at the step of acrylic acidproduction,<br>
this treatment will prove efficient in allowing a decrease<br>
in the amount of treatment at the subsequent purifying step.<br>
Thus, a method has been proposed which comprises supplying<br>
a reaction composition containing more than 7 vol% of propylene,<br>
molecular oxygen, steam, and the balance of an inert gas to<br>
a reactor having disposed therein numerous reaction tubes<br>
each packed with a catalyst and furnished with two reaction<br>
zones thereby allowing utility of a propylene reactant of<br>
a high concentration (JP-A-2000-103761). In one example 1<br>
cited in this official gazette, the absorption with water<br>
obtained an acrylic acid solution having an average<br>
concentration of 69.5 wt%.<br><br>
Another method has been disclosed which comprises<br>
introducing an acrylic acid-containing gas into the<br>
absorption column, introducing a recovery water containing<br>
acetic acid emanating from the bottom liquid of a solvent<br>
recovering column at the purifying step into the top of the<br>
absorption column thereby effecting absorption of acrylic<br>
acid therein, and producing as the bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column an acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
composed of 50 - 80 wt% of acrylic acid, 2-5 wt% of acetic<br>
acid, and the balance of water (JP-A-1993-246941) . This<br>
method obtains purified acrylic acid by sub j ect ing the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution to azeotropic dehydration using a<br>
mixed solution of two or more azeotropic solvents and<br>
subsequently passing the product of dehydration through such<br>
steps as the removal of high boiling substance.<br>
Still another method has been disclosed which, in the<br>
absorption with water of an acrylic acid-containing gas<br>
resulting from a reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation,<br>
comprises supplying the recovery water emanating from the<br>
step of azeotropic dehydration to the absorption column,<br>
supplying the resultant acrylic acid-containing solution to<br>
a stripping column, and obtaining an acrylic acid solution<br>
composed of 70.9 wt. % of acrylic acid, 25.6 wt. % of water,<br>
and 2.0 wt. % of acetic acid via the bottom of the stripping<br>
column (JP-A-2001-199931). This method obtains purified<br>
acrylic acid by performing azeotropic dehydration of the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution and subsequently subjecting<br>
the product of dehydration to the step of crystallization.<br>
The methods published in the official gazettes mentioned<br>
above, however, necessitate a stripping column for the purpose<br>
of obtaining an aqueous solution containing acrylic acid at<br>
a high concentration and, when an organic solvent is used<br><br>
as an absorption solvent, subsequently necessitate a step<br>
of solvent separation. Further, they have such a complicated<br>
procedure as adjusting anew the conditions of the reaction<br>
of catalytic gas phase oxidation. In spite of these measures,<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solutions they produce have<br>
concentrations which hardly deserve to be called fully<br>
satisfactory. In JP-A-1997-117445 mentioned above, for<br>
example, since the high boiling solvent used therein has a<br>
lower absorbing power than water, the acrylic acid<br>
concentration of the solution obtained at the step of<br>
absorption is about 20 wt. % at the most.<br>
When the acrylic acid concentration is low in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution obtained from the step of absorption,<br>
this low concentration results in adding to the impurities<br>
to be separated at the subsequent steps and requiring the<br>
equipment for the separation to be enlarged and inevitably<br>
entailing an increase in the amount of necessary utilities.<br>
An attempt to heighten the acrylic acid concentration in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution obtained at the step of<br>
absorption is actually infeasible commercially because it<br>
increases the loss of acrylic acid at the step of absorption.<br>
In the inventions of JP-A-2000-103761, JP-A-1993-246941, and<br>
JP-A-2001-199931, the acrylic acid concentrations in the<br>
solutions obtained at the step of absorption are 80 wt. %<br>
at the most and the losses of acrylic acid, therefore, are<br>
presumed to be high.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution in the absorption<br>
column is decided by the amount of acrylic acid and the amount<br>
of a solvent to be supplied therein. To prepare the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of a high concentration, therefore,<br><br>
it suffices to lower the amount of the solvent. An attempt<br>
to obtain bottom liquid which have an acrylic acid<br>
concentration of not less than 70 wt. %, however, is not easily<br>
carried out because the loss of acrylic acid through the top<br>
of the absorption column increases when the amount of the<br>
solvent for absorbing acrylic acid supplying to the absorption<br>
column is decreased. The present inventors have pursued a<br>
study in search of conditions which permit preparation of<br>
an acrylic acid-containing solution of high concentration<br>
while lowering the loss of acrylic acid. They have perfected<br>
this invention as a result. Specifically, they have found<br>
that when the amount of the water contained in the raw material<br>
is decreased, the amount of the water introduced into the<br>
reactor can be decreased and the (meth) acrylic acid solution<br>
of high concentration is obtained while the loss of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid is allayed, and that while part of the<br>
gas emanating from the absorption column is recycled to the<br>
reactor, the (meth)acrylic acid solution of high<br>
concentration is obtained as suppressing the loss of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid by decreasing the amount of a condensable<br>
substance in the recycled gas being introduced via the reactor<br>
in the form of a gas again into the absorption column excluding<br>
no change in the amount of the condensable substance in the<br>
waste gas discharged from the system. This invention has been<br>
perfected based on this knowledge.<br>
Accordingly, the instant invention provides a method for<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid by a procedure comprising the<br>
steps of subjecting raw material such as herein described of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid to a reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation, absorbing (meth)acrylic acid, separating a gas<br><br>
discharged from the absorbing step into a recycle gas such as<br>
herein described and a waste gas, cooling said recycle gas<br>
and circulating the recycle gas to a reactor and discarding<br>
the waste gas to outside of the system, wherein the<br>
concentration of a condensable substance such as herein<br>
described contained in the recycle gas is lower than the<br>
concentration of a condensable substance contained in the<br>
waste gas, and said cooling step induces condensation of at<br>
least part of a condensable substance contained therein in<br>
the form of a condensate and consequently lowers the<br>
concentration of the condensable substance contained in said<br>
gas, and removes water content or acid content or both from<br>
the recycle gas.<br>
This invention is also directed toward providing a method<br>
for producing (meth)acrylic acid by a procedure comprising<br>
a step of supplying the raw material of (meth)acrylic acid<br>
and a molecular oxygen-containing gas to a reactor for<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation thereby obtaining a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid-containing gas and a step of absorbing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid contained in the gas, characterized by<br>
removing the water contained in the molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas prior to the introduction of the gas<br>
into the reactor. The use of the molecular oxygen-containing<br>
gas which has been dehumidified in advance results in<br>
decreasing the amount of water introduced into the reactor<br>
and permitting absorption of the (meth) acrylic acid of high<br>
concentration at a high yield.<br>
The instant invention also provides an apparatus for the<br>
production of (meth)acrylic acid, comprising a reactor for<br>
subjecting raw material of (meth)acrylic acid to catalytic<br><br>
gas phase oxidation, a (meth)acrylic acid absorption column<br>
for absorbing (meth)acrylic acid obtained by catalytic gas<br>
phase oxidation, and a piping for discharging a residual gas<br>
from the top of said absorption column after said absorption<br>
and said circulation of the discharged gas as a recycle gas<br>
to said reactor, wherein said piping is furnished with a<br>
branch for discarding part of the discharged gas as a waste<br>
gas to the out side of system and is provided between said<br>
branch and the reactor with a device for removing condensable<br>
substances contained in said recycle gas.<br>
According to this invention, by cooling exclusively part<br>
of the gas discharged from the (meth) acrylic acid absorption<br>
column as circulating a part of the discharged gas to the<br>
reactor, it is made possible to decrease the amount of water<br>
contained in the recycle gas and enhance the absorption<br>
efficiency of (meth) acrylic acid. Further, by decreasing the<br>
acid content in the recycle gas, it is made possible to prevent<br>
the catalyst from deterioration.<br>
The decrease of the water content is also attained by<br>
dehumidifying the air to be supplied to the reactor in advance<br>
of the supply. Consequently, the absorption efficiency of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid can be enhanced as well.<br>
According to this invention, the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution can be obtained in high<br>
concentration. As a result, the containedwater can be removed<br>
in the subsequent step without requiring use of an azeotropic<br>
solvent and the step of azeotropic dehydration can be omitted<br><br>
and, owing to the absence of survival of the azeotropic solvent,<br>
the step of separation of the solvent can be eliminated, with<br>
the result that the process of production will be simplified.<br>
Now, the invention will be described in detail below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure is a process diagram illustrating one example<br>
of the preferred mode of embodying this invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The first aspect of this invention is directed toward<br>
providing a method for producing (meth)acrylic acid by a<br>
procedure comprising a step of subjecting raw material of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid to a reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation, a step of absorbing (meth) acrylic acid, and a step<br>
of circulating part of a gas discharged from the absorbing<br>
step as a recycle gas to a reactor and discarding the remainder<br>
of the discharged gas as waste gas to the out side of system,<br>
wherein the concentration of a condensable substance<br>
contained in the recycle gas is lower than the concentration<br>
of a condensable substance contained in the waste gas (i),<br>
and a method for producing (meth) acrylic acid by a procedure<br>
comprising a step of supplying the raw material of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid and a molecular oxygen-containing gas to<br>
a reactor for the reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
thereby obtaining a (meth)acrylic acid-containing gas and<br>
a step of absorbing (meth) acrylic acid contained in said gas,<br>
wherein said molecular oxygen-containing gas is introduced<br>
into said reactor after the water component contained in said<br>
gas has been removed (ii).<br>
For the purpose of obtaining a (meth)acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration, it is<br><br>
necessary either to decrease the amount of water introduced<br>
into the system or to increase the amount of water discarded<br>
to the out side of system. Heretofore, it has been customary<br>
to recycle the gas discharged from the absorption column to<br>
the reactor without cooling the gas in the meantime. The<br>
present invention obtains the (meth)acrylic acid solution<br>
of high concentration by cooling the recycle gas thereby<br>
decreasing the amount of water contained therein and<br>
consequently decreasing the amount of water recycled to the<br>
reactor and/or by dehumidifying the air supplied as an<br>
oxidizing gas to the reactor prior to the supply to the reactor<br>
thereby decreasing the amount of water introduced into the<br>
absorption column. When the whole amount of the discharged<br>
gas from the absorption column is cooled and the amount of<br>
water discarded to the out side of system is consequently<br>
decreased, the amount of water in the recycle gas is indeed<br>
decreased but the absorption efficiency of (meth) acrylic acid<br>
is not heightened and rather lowered widely than when the<br>
cooling is omitted. This invention, therefore, effects<br>
condensation of not merely the water component but also the<br>
acid component in the part of the gas discharged from the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid absorption column which is recycled as<br>
the so-called recycle gas to the reactor to enhance the<br>
absorption efficiency of (meth)acrylic acid and further<br>
prevent the catalyst from deterioration. The decrease of the<br>
concentration of a condensable substance contained in the<br>
recycle gas (i) and the removal of the water component from<br>
the air mentioned above (ii) may be carried out either singly<br>
or in combination.<br>
As used in this specification, the term "(meth) acrylic<br>
acid" refers to acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and the term<br>
"condensable substance" to a substance which assumes a liquid<br><br>
state at 20°C under an atmospheric pressure. Now, one example<br>
of the preferred embodiment this invention in the production<br>
of acrylic acid from propylene and/or acrolein as the raw<br>
material gas will be described below based on The Figure.<br>
First, such a molecular oxygen-containing gas as air<br>
3 having the amount of water decreased with a dehumidifying<br>
device not shown in the diagram, the raw material of acrylic<br>
acid such as propylene and/or acrolein 1, and a diluting gas<br>
5 are mixed together. At this step, a recycle gas 34 which<br>
has undergone the acrylic acid absorbing step and subsequently<br>
discharged through the top of the absorption column may be<br>
mixed with the air, propylene and/or acrolein, and diluting<br>
gas. In this case, the recycle gas 34 maybe used as a diluting<br>
gas. This mixed gas (hereinafter referred to occasionally<br>
as "the raw material gas") is supplied to a reactor 20 packed<br>
with a catalyst 10 for catalytic gas phase oxidation and<br>
subjected therein to a reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation to obtain an acrylic acid-containing gas 25. The<br>
gas 25 is supplied to the absorption column 30 via the bottom<br>
thereof and an aqueous solution absorbent 33 is supplied to<br>
the absorption column 30 via the top thereof, with the result<br>
that the acrylic acid-containing gas 25 and the aqueous<br>
solution absorbent 33 will be brought into mutual contact.<br>
In this specification, the part of a discharged gas 32 from<br>
the top of the absorption column 30, namely the discharge<br>
gas circulated to the reactor will be referred to as "a recycle<br>
gas" and the part thereof, namely the gas discharged to the<br>
out side of system will be referred to as "a waste gas." In<br>
this invention, the recycle gas 34 alone is introduced into<br>
a cooling column 36, cooled therein by gas-liquid contact<br>
with an absorbing water 33' newly supplied into the system,<br>
condensed a condensable substance contained in the recycle<br><br>
gas, and subsequently circulated to the reactor 20. The<br>
resultant condensed liquid may be mixed with the absorbing<br>
water 33' mentioned above and supplied as the aqueous solution<br>
absorbent 33 to the absorption column 30. Thus, by adjusting<br>
the temperature of the top of the absorption column with a<br>
cooling device 37 disposed in the absorption column, it is<br>
made possible to obtain a solution 35 containing acrylic acid<br>
in high concentration via the bottom of the absorption column.<br>
The steps following the absorbing step do not need to<br>
be particularly restricted. For the sake of efficiently<br>
purifying the acrylic acid-containing solution of high<br>
concentration, this invention contemplates a procedure which<br>
comprises supplying the acrylic acid-containing solution 35<br>
to a first distillation column 40 and causing a low boiling<br>
substance contained therein to remove and consequently<br>
obtaining crude acrylic acid 41. Acrylic acid 60 as a finished<br>
product is obtained by supplying the crude acrylic acid 41<br>
to a crystallizing column 50. The bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column, depending on the composition thereof, may<br>
be directly supplied to the crystallizing column 50 without<br>
using the first distillation column 40. Since the high boiling<br>
substance contained in the bottom liquid 43 of the first<br>
distillation column 40 contains acrylic acid dimer, the bottom<br>
liquid is supplied to a second distillation column 70 furnished<br>
on the bottom thereof with a thin film distilling device 73<br>
so as to concentrate the acrylic acid dimer. Subsequently,<br>
the dimer is retained in a dimmer decomposing tank 75 so as<br>
to be thermally decomposed into acrylic acid. This acrylic<br>
acid may be circulated via the second distillation column<br>
70 to the first distillation column 40 and/or the absorption<br>
column 30 so as to be recovered as the finished product. The<br>
term "low boiling substance" refers to a substance which has<br><br>
a lower boiling point than (meth)acrylic acid in the normal<br>
state and the term "high boiling substance" refers to a<br>
substance which has a higher boiling point than (meth) acrylic<br>
acid in the normal state.<br>
In this invention, propylene and/or acrolein can be used<br>
as the raw material gas of acrylic acid. While the reactor<br>
20 does not need to be particularly restricted but is only<br>
required to be capable of performing a reaction of catalytic<br>
gas phase oxidation. The shell-and-tube type reactor can be<br>
used advantageously in respect that it excels in the efficiency<br>
of reaction. By packing the reactor 20 with the well-known<br>
catalyst 10 for catalytic gas phase oxidation and then bringing<br>
the raw material gas into contact with such a molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas as oxygen or air, it is made possible<br>
to effect the oxidation of the raw material gas. When<br>
propylene is used as the raw material gas, the propylene<br>
concentration is in the range of 7 - 15 vol% and the molecular<br>
oxygen concentration is such that the ratio of propylene :<br>
molecular oxygen (by volume) falls in the range of 1 : 1.0<br>
- 2.0. Air may be used as the source of supply of molecular<br>
oxygen. When the air contains a water component, it is<br>
preferred to be dehumidified prior to the supply thereof to<br>
the reactor. The dehumidification is preferred because it<br>
is capable of decreasing the amount of water introduced into<br>
the reactor and consequently decreasing the amount of water<br>
introduced to the absorption column. It is permissible to<br>
use an oxygen-enriched air or purified oxygen in the place<br>
of air. As concrete examples of the diluting gas 5, nitrogen,<br>
carbon dioxide, and other inert gases may be cited.<br>
In this invention, the recycle gas may be introduced<br>
into the reactor after it has been cooled to induce condensation<br>
of a condensable substance. When the recycle gas is used in<br><br>
this manner, the recycle gas is deprived of the water component<br>
in advance so that the water concentration in the raw material<br>
gas supplied to the reactor falls in the range of 0 - 10 vol%,<br>
preferably in the range of 0 - 7 vol%, and particularly in<br>
the range of 0 - 6 vol% . When the molecular oxygen-containing<br>
gas is deprived of the water component without using the recycle<br>
gas, the concentration of the water component in the raw<br>
material gas supplied to te reactor is so adjusted as to fall<br>
in the range of 0 - 5 vol%, more preferably in the range of<br>
0-3 vol%, and particularly preferably in the range of 0<br>
- 1 vol%. If the concentration exceeds 10 vol%, the excess<br>
will possibly result in causing the water component supplied<br>
via the reactor to the absorption column to increase the acrylic<br>
acid loss ratio. The total acid concentration is so adjusted<br>
at to fall in the range of 0 - 0.2 vol% and more preferably<br>
in the range of 0 - 0.1 vol%. If the total acid concentration<br>
exceeds 0.2 vol%, the excess will possibly result in<br>
accelerating the deterioration of the catalyst by oxidation.<br>
The recycle gas contains unaltered propylene and acrolien,<br>
oxygen, diluting gas, etc. in addition to the water component<br>
and the acid component. The propylene, oxygen, water<br>
component concentration, and total acid concentration<br>
mentioned above can be easily adjusted by computing the amount<br>
of the water component contained in the recycle gas and the<br>
amount thereof to be incorporated in the raw material gas<br>
so as to enable the water component concentration and the<br>
total acid concentration in the raw material gas to fall in<br>
the optimum ranges mentioned above and computing the propylene<br>
concentration and the oxygen concentration in the recycle<br>
gas thereby deciding the amount of propylene and the amount<br>
of air to be newly supplied to the reactor. The term "total<br>
acid" as used herein refers to compounds having a carboxyl<br><br>
group. The recycle gas contains acrylic acid, formic acid,<br>
and acetic acid as compounds answering the description.<br>
The reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation performed<br>
by using propylene as the raw material is generally carried<br>
out in two stages by the use of two kinds of catalyst 10 for<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation. The catalyst for the first<br>
stage of this reaction is capable of forming acrolein mainly<br>
by the gas phase oxidation of the raw material gas containing<br>
propylene in a gas phase and the catalyst for the second stage<br>
of the reaction is capable of forming acrylic acid mainly<br>
by the gas phase oxidation of the raw material containing<br>
acrolein. As the catalyst for the first stage of the reaction,<br>
a complex oxide containing iron, molybdenum, and bismuth may<br>
be cited. As the catalyst for the second stage of the reaction,<br>
a catalyst having vanadium as an essential component may be<br>
cited.<br>
The Figure depicts the mode of performing the two-stage<br>
reaction mentioned above with a single reactor. Optionally,<br>
this reaction may be performed in a tandem system having two<br>
different reactors connected to each other. The acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas 25 which is obtained by the reaction of<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation contains 5-14 vol% of acrylic<br>
acid, 0.1 - 2.5 vol% of acetic acid, 0.5-3 vol% of molecular<br>
oxygen, and 5-36 vol% of water and other components which<br>
are by-products of reaction such as the unaltered component<br>
of the raw material gas, propionic acid, maleic acid, acetone,<br>
acrolein, furfural, formaldehyde and COx.<br>
In the acrylic acid absorption column 30, any of the<br>
known methods of contact may be used for establishing contact<br>
between the acrylic acid-containing gas and the aqueous<br>
solution absorbent. As concrete examples of such methods of<br>
contact, crossflow contact devices using a bubble-cap tray,<br><br>
a perforated tray, a jet tray, a valve tray; and counter current<br>
contact devices using a dual flow tray, a ripple tray,<br>
structured packings of gauze type, sheet type, and grid type<br>
and random packings may be cited.<br>
As the aqueous solution absorbent 33 to be used in this<br>
invention, a wide variety of aqueous solutions which are<br>
capable of absorbing acrylic acid are available. The<br>
condensate resulting from cooling the recycle gas may be used<br>
as the aqueous solution absorbent. Since the condensate often<br>
contains acrylic acid, it is preferred to be reused as the<br>
aqueous solution absorbent. The temperature of the aqueous<br>
solution absorbent at the time of introduction falls in the<br>
range of 0 - 50°C and preferably in the range of 10 - 40°C.<br>
The flow rate ratio of mass of the absorbing water (which<br>
excludes the condensate from the recycle gas and corresponds<br>
to the absorbing water 33' shown in The Figure) to the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas maybe properly selected to suit the target<br>
acrylic acid concentration. The absorption of acrylic acid<br>
is effected by counter current contact using a mass flow rate<br>
of the absorbing water of 0.1 - 1.5 times, preferably 0.1<br>
- 1.0 times, and particularly 0.15 - 0.8 times to the mass<br>
flow rate of acrylic acid contained in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas. If the mass flow rate ratio falls short<br>
of the level of 0.1 times, the shortage will possibly induce<br>
an extreme decrease of the efficiency of the acrylic acid<br>
absorption column. Conversely, if it exceeds the level of<br>
1. 5 times, the excess will render the acquisition of an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration difficult.<br>
Incidentally, the absorbing water may contain therein for<br>
the purpose of preventing such polymerizing substances as<br>
acrylic acid from succumbing to polymerization one or more<br>
compounds selected from the group consisting of N-oxyl<br><br>
compounds, phenol compounds, manganese salts such as<br>
manganese acetate, copper salts of dialkyl-dithiocarbamic<br>
acid such as copper dibutylthiocarbamate, nitroso compounds,<br>
amine compounds, and phenothiazine which are cited as in the<br>
official gazettes of JP-A-2001-348360, 2001-348358, and<br>
2001-348359.<br>
The acrylic acid absorption column is generally operated<br>
above normal pressure. In this invention, the column top<br>
pressure (gauge pressure) is set in the range of 0 - 0.4 MPa,<br>
preferably in the range of 0 - 0.1 MPa, and particularly in<br>
the range of 0 - 0.03 MPa. If this pressure falls short of<br>
0 MPa (gauge pressure), the shortage will necessitate a<br>
pressure decreasing device and consequently add to the cost<br>
of equipment and the cost of utilities. Conversely, if the<br>
pressure exceeds 0.4 MPa (gauge pressure), the excess will<br>
possibly require the temperature of the absorption column<br>
to be elevated considerably for the purpose of discharging<br>
a low boiling substance from the column top and consequently<br>
degrade the absorption efficiency. The column top<br>
temperature falls generally in the range of 30 - 85°C and<br>
particularly in the range of 40 - 80°C. In this invention,<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution 35 comprising 70 - 98<br>
wt. % of acrylic acid, 1 - 29 wt. % of water, and 1 - 10 wt. %<br>
of impurities (such as acids like acetic acid, maleic acid,<br>
and propionic acid, aldehydes like furfural and formaldehyde)<br>
is obtained under the conditions of absorption mentioned<br>
above.<br>
This invention is characterized by the fact that when<br>
part of the gas discharged through the top of the absorption<br>
column 30 is recycled to the reactor 20 and the remainder<br>
thereof is discarded, the concentration of the condensable<br>
substance contained in the recycle gas is made lower than<br><br>
the concentration of the condensable substance contained in<br>
the waste gas. Water, acrylic acid, and acetic acid are<br>
condensable substances. The reason for decreasing their<br>
concentrations and consequently decreasing their amount for<br>
circulation to the absorption column resides in enhancing<br>
the absorption efficiency of acrylic acid. The gas discharged<br>
from the absorption column may be given any of such treatments<br>
as increase of pressure, elevation of temperature, and<br>
combustion before the gas is separated into the cycle gas<br>
and the waste gas. To lower the concentrations of such<br>
condensable substances, it is only necessary that the recycle<br>
gas alone be cooled so as to condense such condensable<br>
substances as water and acrylic acid, etc. and decrease the<br>
amount of the water component and the amount of acrylic acid,<br>
etc. When the discharged gas is cooled, the recycle gas must<br>
be cooler than the waste gas. This limitation is necessary<br>
because the concentrations of condensable substances could<br>
not be otherwise differentiated between the recycle gas and<br>
the waste gas. Specifically, as demonstrated in the working<br>
examples cited herein below, when the whole amount of the<br>
gas discharged from the absorption column is cooled to lower<br>
the concentrations of the condensable substances contained<br>
in the recycle gas, the acrylic acid loss ratio is rather<br>
suffered to increase to a greater level than when then the<br>
recycle gas is not cooled at all. Though this phenomenon<br>
remains yet to be clarified, it may be logically explained<br>
by a postulate that since the amount of the water component<br>
contained in the discharged gas is increased in accordance<br>
as the temperature of this gas is heightened, the cooling<br>
effected also on the waste gas possibly obstruct the efficient<br>
waste of the water component to the out side of system. In<br>
any event, when the whole amount of the discharged gas is<br><br>
cooled and reused in the absorption column, the efficiency<br>
of the absorption with the aqueous solution absorbent is<br>
degraded consequently. As a result, the concentration of<br>
acrylic acid in the gas discharged from the absorption column<br>
increases with the elapse of time, the amount of acrylic acid<br>
discarded as the waste gas from the system increases, and<br>
the acrylic acid loss ratio eventually increases. When part<br>
of the piping for circulating the gas discharged via the top<br>
of the absorption column as the recycle gas to the reactor<br>
is furnished with a branch for discarding the waste gas,<br>
therefore, it is advisable to interpose a cooling device<br>
between the branch and the reactor to cool exclusively the<br>
recycle gas.<br>
The method for cooling the recycle gas does not need<br>
to be particularly restricted. It is only required to resort<br>
to a device which is capable of condensing the condensable<br>
substances contained in the recycle gas . As concrete examples<br>
of the device answering the description, the shell-and-tube<br>
type heat exchanger, fin tube type heat exchanger, air cooled<br>
heat exchanger, double pipe heat exchanger, coil type heat<br>
exchanger, direct contact type heat exchanger, and plate type<br>
heat exchanger may be cited. Since the condensate more often<br>
than not contains such polymerizable substances as acrylic<br>
acid, however, the method of cooling which resorts to the<br>
combination of the cooling column 36 and such a cooling device<br>
39 as illustrated in The Figure is commendable in respect<br>
that it permits easy supply of a polymerization inhibitor.<br>
The cooling temperature of the recycle gas does not need<br>
to be particularly restricted. The total amount of the raw<br>
material gas supplied to the reactor is so cooled till<br>
condensation that the concentration of the water component<br>
therein falls in the range of 0 - 10 vol%, preferably in the<br><br>
range of 0 - 7 vol%, and particularly in the range of 0 -<br>
6 vol% and further the concentration of the total acid falls<br>
in the range of 0 - 0.2 vol%, preferably in the range of 0<br>
0.1 vol%. When air is used as the molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas, the air contains a water component.<br>
The amount of the water component which exists after the recycle<br>
gas is cooled is computed from the amount of the air supplied,<br>
the aforementioned preferred concentration of the water<br>
component in the raw material gas and the amount of the raw<br>
material gas supplied and the cooling is carried out till<br>
the concentration of the water component found by the<br>
computation is reached. In this invention, the recycle gas<br>
is cooled to a temperature which is 1 - 50°C, preferably 2<br>
- 40°C, and particularly preferably 3- 30°C lower than the<br>
temperature of the waste gas.<br>
The condensate resulting from the condensation caused<br>
by cooling may be returned to the absorption column or may<br>
be withdrawn from the system instead of being so returned.<br>
Though the acrylic acid loss ratio is not changed very much<br>
between these two choices, the return to the absorption column<br>
is at an advantage in obviating the necessity for treating<br>
waste liquid. The recycle gas which has been cooled may be<br>
supplied without changing the temperature existing during<br>
the cooling to the reactor or may be heated with the object<br>
of preventing the deposition of acrylic acid on the inner<br>
wall of the piping extending from the cooling device to the<br>
reactor. In this invention, the method for decreasing the<br>
condensable substances in the recycle gas does not need to<br>
be limited to the cooling of the recycle gas.<br>
In this invention, since the absorption column produces<br>
bottom liquid which have an extremely high acrylic acid<br>
concentration of 70 - 98 wt. %, the subsequent step of<br><br>
purification can be carried out easily. Though the method<br>
of purifying the acrylic acid-containing solution to such<br>
a high concentration as mentioned above does not need to be<br>
restricted, the method which comprises removing such low<br>
boiling substances as water contained in the solution and<br>
subsequently purifying the remaining solution by<br>
crystallization may be cited. For example, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 35 is supplied to the first<br>
distillation column 40 and crude acrylic acid containing<br>
substantially no water is separated as a bottom column flow<br>
and/or a side column flow.<br>
The first distillation column 40 does not need to be<br>
particularly restricted but is only required to be capable<br>
of separating acrylic acid. A packed column, a plate column<br>
(tray column), etc. are available.<br>
The first distillation column 40 can execute expected<br>
distillation under the conditions that enable such low boiling<br>
substances as water and acetic acid to be separated. This<br>
distillation does not require use of an azeotropic solvent.<br>
This is because the absorbing step produces an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration and, as a<br>
result, such low boiling substances as water and acetic acid<br>
which are contained in the solution are efficiently separated<br>
as a distillate from the top of the first distillation column<br>
40 without using use of an azeotropic solvent. Since no<br>
azeotropic solvent is used, the distillate mentioned above<br>
can be used as an acetic acid-containing aqueous solution<br>
without requiring oil-water separation. The conditions of<br>
the distillation may be properly selected, depending on the<br>
concentration of acrylic acid in the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution 35 to be introduced and the purity of the crude acrylic<br>
acid aimed at. Commendably, the column top pressure (absolute<br><br>
pressure) is set in the range of 20 - 400 hPa, preferably<br>
in the range of 30 hPa - 300 hPa, and particularly in the<br>
range of 30 - 200 hPa. If this pressure falls short of 20<br>
hPa (absolute pressure), the shortage will be at a disadvantage<br>
in requiring the column, condenser, and vacuum device to be<br>
enlarged and the cost of equipment to be unduly increased.<br>
Conversely, if the pressure exceeds 400 hPa (absolute<br>
pressure), the excess will be at a disadvantage in heightening<br>
the temperature inside the distillation column 40 and adding<br>
to the possibility of polymerization. The column top<br>
temperature falls generally in the range of 30 - 70°C and<br>
particularly in the range of 40 - 60°C. Then, the column bottom<br>
temperature falls generally in the range of 70 - 120°C and<br>
particularly in the range of 80 - 110°C. The distillation<br>
performed under these conditions produces crude acrylic acid<br>
containing substantially no water and having an acetic acid<br>
content in the range of 0 - 1.0 wt. % as a column side stream<br>
of the distillation column.<br>
In this invention, the purification of this crude acrylic<br>
acid may be executed by utilizing a step of azeotropic<br>
dehydration, a step of separating low boiling substances<br>
subsequent to the dehydrating step mentioned above, a step<br>
of separating high boiling substances, and other steps of<br>
purification which are disclosed in the official gazettes<br>
of JP-A-2000-290221, 2001-226320, 2001-348360, and<br>
2001-348358 in addition to a distillation column illustrated<br>
as the first distillation column 40 in The Figure. This<br>
invention, however, is characterized by preparing an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration and purifying<br>
this solution and, as a result, enabling such low boiling<br>
substances as water and acetic acid to be removed from the<br>
solution without requiring use of an azeotropic solvent and<br><br>
avoiding installation of a solvent recovering column and an<br>
oil-water separating device for separating a solvent and a<br>
recovered water. Incidentally, the step of purifying acrylic<br>
acid does not need to be limited to purification by distillation.<br>
Optionally, the purification of acrylic acid may be effected<br>
by properly combining stripping, crystallization, extraction,<br>
absorption, and partial condensation.<br>
This invention obtains the purified acrylic acid 60 by<br>
supplying the crude acrylic acid 41 to the crystallizing column<br>
50. The crystallization is an operation for precipitating<br>
crystals from the liquid phase and the gas phase. This mode<br>
of operation can be performed by following the procedure<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2001-199931 with necessary modifications.<br>
The bottom liquid of the second distillation column 70<br>
have high viscosity. The distillation column 70, therefore,<br>
is preferred to be provided additionally on the column bottom<br>
side with the thin layer evaporator 73. Commendably, the<br>
second distillation column 70 executes the expected<br>
distillation with a number of theoretical plate in the range<br>
of 1 - 5 under a reduced pressure in the range of 10 - 150<br>
hPa (absolute pressure) at a column bottom temperature of<br>
not higher than 120°C. The high boiling substances contained<br>
in the bottom liquid of the first distillation column 40 include<br>
acrylic acid dimer, maleic acid, and polymerization inhibitor,<br>
for example.<br>
In this invention, acrylic acid may be distilled from<br>
the top of the second distillation column and part of the<br>
distillate may be supplied to any of the crystallizing device<br>
50, the first distillation column 40, and the absorption column<br>
30.<br>
The liquid formed in the thin layer evaporator 73<br>
mentioned above is supplied to the dimmer decomposing tank<br><br>
75. In this dimmer decomposing tank 75, the acrylic acid dimer<br>
is decomposed at a temperature in the range of 120 - 220°C.<br>
The hold up time (the liquid amount in of the dimmer decomposing<br>
tank/amount of waste oil), though variable with the<br>
temperature of thermal decomposition, generally falls in the<br>
range of 20 - 50 hours. After the acrylic acid dimer is<br>
decomposed into acrylic acid, th acrylic acid can be<br>
effectively utilized by circulating the acrylic acid to the<br>
thin layer evaporator 73 and supplying the distillate from<br>
the top of the second distillation column to the first<br>
distillation column 40. In this invention, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration can be<br>
prepared in the acrylic acid absorption column 30, which<br>
solution can be prevented from polymerization by the addition<br>
of a polymerization inhibitor. At the step of absorption and<br>
the step of purification, polymerization inhibitors<br>
conforming to relevant acrylic acid concentrations are used.<br>
In this invention, these polymerization inhibitors are<br>
expelled out of the system as a waste liquid of the dimmer<br>
decomposing tank 75 to allow manufacture of acrylic acid 60<br>
of high concentration as a finished product.<br>
Incidentally, the residual mother liquid recovered from<br>
the crystallizing device 50 may be supplied in the whole amount<br>
to any of the absorption column 30, the first distillation<br>
column 40, the second distillation column 70, the thin layer<br>
evaporator 73, and the dimmer decomposing tank 75. Otherwise,<br>
part of the mother liquid may be discharged as waste oil to<br>
the out side of system. When the whole amount of the residual<br>
liquid mentioned above is supplied to the acrylic acid dimer<br>
decomposing step, part of the acrylic acid recovered from<br>
the acrylic acid dimer decomposing step may be discharged<br>
to the out side of system for the purpose of avoiding<br><br>
concentration of low boiling substances. Otherwise, the<br>
acrylic acid may be subjected to a chemical pretreatment for<br>
the purpose of converting aldehydes and maleic acid to high<br>
boiling substances before it is supplied to the acrylic acid<br>
dimer decomposing step. As a result, the concentration of<br>
impurities in the acrylic acid to be recovered by the acrylic<br>
acid dimer decomposing step can be decreased. This mode of<br>
operation may be carried out by following the procedure<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2001-199931 with necessary modifications.<br>
The method for producing acrylic acid has been described<br>
hitherto. Methacrylic acid may be produced by using at least<br>
one compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
methacrolein, isobutyl aldehyde, isobutyric acid, and<br>
isobutane in the place of propylene and/or acrolein and also<br>
using a catalyst containing at least the oxides of phosphorus,<br>
molybdenum, vanadium, iron, copper, and antimony and used<br>
for the production of methacrylic acid as disclosed in<br>
JP-A-1987-161739, a catalyst containing at least the oxides<br>
of phosphorus and molybdenum and used for the production of<br>
methacrylic acid as disclosed in JP-A-1992-90853, a<br>
multicomponent type catalyst containing phosphorus,<br>
molybdenum, vanadium, and copper and used for the production<br>
of methacrylic acid as disclosed in JP-A-1993-96172, a<br>
catalyst containing at least the oxides of phosphorus,<br>
molybdenum, vanadium, and arsenic and used for the production<br>
of methacrylic acid as disclosed in JP-A-1994-86932, or a<br>
catalyst containing at least the oxides of molybdenum,<br>
phosphorus, vanadium, antimony, rhenium and used for the<br>
production of methacrylic acid as disclosed in<br>
JP-A-1995-163883. The purification of a methacrylic<br>
acid-containing solution having a concentration in the range<br>
of 70 - 95 wt. % may be effected by following the process<br><br>
illustrated in The Figure with necessary modification or by<br>
adopting the hitherto known method for the production of<br>
methacrylic acid.<br>
The second aspect of this invention is directed toward<br>
an apparatus for the production of (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
comprising a reactor for subjecting the raw material of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid to catalytic gas phase oxidation, a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid absorption column for absorbing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid obtained by the catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation, and a piping for discharging residual gas from<br>
the top of the absorption column and circulating the discharged<br>
gas as a recycle gas to the reactor, wherein the piping is<br>
furnished with a branch for discarding part of the waste gas<br>
to the out side of system and a device for removing condensable<br>
substances contained in the recycle gas is interposed between<br>
the branch and the reactor.<br>
The use of this apparatus enables the condensable<br>
substances exclusively in the part of the discharged gas from<br>
the absorption column which is recycled to the reactor to<br>
remove or decrease and consequently allows the amounts of<br>
water, acrylic acid, and acetic acid contained in the recycle<br>
gas to decrease. As a result, the absorption efficiency of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid can be exalted. Further, the catalyst can<br>
be prevented from deterioration because the amounts of acid<br>
component contained in the recycle gas to the reactor are<br>
decreased.<br>
As a means to remove such condensable substances, a device<br>
for cooling a gas is available. As concrete examples of the<br>
gas cooling device, the combination of a cooling column and<br>
a cooling device illustrated in The Figure and the<br>
shell-and-tube heat exchanger, fin tube type heat exchanger,<br>
air-cooled type heat exchanger, double pipe type heat<br><br>
exchanger, coil type heat exchanger, direct contact type heat<br>
exchanger, and plate type heat exchanger enumerated above<br>
may be cited.<br>
The third aspect of this invention is directed to an<br>
apparatus for the production of (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
comprising an introduction line for introducing the raw<br>
material of (meth)acrylic acid and a molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas to a reactor, the reactor used for<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation and connected to the line, and<br>
a (meth)acrylic acid absorption column for absorbing the<br>
(meth) acrylic acid obtained by the catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation, wherein the molecular oxygen-containing gas<br>
introducing line is furnished with a device for removing a<br>
water component.<br>
The reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation uses a<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas. Air is used in most cases<br>
as the gas mentioned above. Generally, air contains a water<br>
component. When the apparatus is used even where air is<br>
supplied to the reactor, the water component contained in<br>
the air can be removed with the water component removing device<br>
before the air is introduced into the reactor. Thus, the<br>
amount of the water component supplied to the reactor can<br>
be decreased and the amount of the water component in the<br>
acrylic acid-containing gas introduced into the absorption<br>
column can be decreased as well. As a result, the absorption<br>
efficiency of acrylic acid can be exalted as described above<br>
and the acrylic acid-containing solution of high<br>
concentration can be manufactured. Moreover, according to<br>
the apparatus, the amount of acrylic acid discharged via the<br>
top of the absorption column can be decreased. When the<br>
discharged gas is recycled to the reactor, therefore, the<br>
deterioration of the catalyst with acids can be prevented<br><br>
because the amounts of acid components such as acrylic acid<br>
which are circulated to the reactor can be decreased.<br>
As concrete examples of the water component removing<br>
device, various devices which are capable of effecting<br>
dehumidification by cooling, absorption, adsorption, and<br>
compression may be cited.<br>
Examples<br>
Now, this invention will be specifically described below<br>
with reference to working examples.<br>
(Example of catalyst production)<br>
A molybdenum-bismuth type catalyst was prepared by<br>
following the procedure of Example 1 cited in JP-A-2000-325795.<br>
This was labeled as "catalyst (I)." A molybdenum-vanadium<br>
type catalyst was prepared by following the procedure of<br>
example 1 cited in JP-A-1996-206504. This was labeled as<br>
"catalyst (11)."<br>
(Formula of calculation)<br>
In the following working examples and comparative<br>
examples, the numerical values of the conversion of propylene,<br>
the yield of acrolein, the yield of acrylic acid, the recycle<br>
ratio, and the acrylic acid loss ratio were calculated in<br>
accordance with the following formulas.<br>
Conversion of propylene (%) = [(Number of mols of<br>
propylene reacted)/(Number of mols of propylene<br>
supplied)] X 100<br>
Yield of acrolein (%) = [(Number of mols of acrolein<br>
formed)/(Number of mols of propylene supplied)]<br><br>
X 100<br>
Yield of acrylic acid(%)= [(Number of mols of acrylic<br>
acid formed) / (Number of mols of propylene<br>
supplied)] X 100<br>
Recycle ratio (%) = [(Number of mols of gas (before<br>
cooling) recycled to the reactor) / (Number of mols<br>
of gas discharged via the top of the absorption<br>
column)] X 100<br>
Acrylic acid loss ratio(%) = [(Amount of acrylic acid<br>
in waste gas and waste liquid) / (Amount of acrylic<br>
acid formed in the reactor)] X 100<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Acrylic acid was produced by using the apparatus<br>
illustrated in The Figure.<br>
A reactor furnished on the outer periphery thereof with<br>
a jacket for circulating a heat medium, containing therein<br>
reaction tubes 25 mm in inside diameter and 7, 000 mm in length,<br>
and provided at a position of 3,500 mm from the lower part<br>
of the jacket with a perforated tube sheet dividing the heat<br>
medium jacket into two halves, an upper one and a lower one,<br>
was used. The lower part (the first reaction zone) and the<br>
upper part (the second reaction zone) of the reactor had their<br>
temperatures controlled by circulation of their respective<br>
heat media. The reactor was packed with (1) ceramic balls<br>
having an average diameter of 5 mm, (2) a mixture of catalyst<br>
(I) and ceramic balls of an average diameter of 5 mm at a<br>
volume ratio of 70 : 30, (3) catalyst (I), (4) raschig rings<br>
made of stainless steel andmeasuring 5 mm in outside diameter,<br><br>
4.5 mm in inside diameter, and 6 mm in length, (5) a mixture<br>
of catalyst (II) and ceramic balls of an average diameter<br>
of 5 mm at a volume ratio of 75 : 25, and (6) catalyst (II)<br>
placed sequentially from the lower part toward the upper part<br>
of the reactor in respective bed lengths of 250 mm, 700 mm,<br>
2,300 mm, 500 mm, 600 mm, and 1,900 mm.<br>
To the first reaction zone of the reactor, propylene,<br>
air (the concentration of water component 2 wt. %), and part<br>
of the discharged gas (recycle gas) from the absorption column<br>
were circulated to supply 8.0 vol% of propylene, 14.4 vol%<br>
of O2, and 5.0 vol% of H2O (the remainder comprising N2, propane,<br>
COx, acrylic acid, and acetic acid, etc.) with the respective<br>
flow rates and the cooling temperature of the recycle gas<br>
so adjusted as to set the space velocity in the first reaction<br>
zone at 1,250 hr-1 (STP).<br>
The heat medium temperatures of the first reaction zone<br>
and the second reaction zone were so adjusted as to set the<br>
conversion of propylene at 97 ± 0.5 mol% and the yield of<br>
acrolein at 1 ± 0.5 mol% under the outlet pressure, 0.15 MPa<br>
(absolute pressure), of the second reaction zone to obtain<br>
an acrylic acid-containing gas.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas thus obtained was<br>
introduced at a temperature of 170°C into an acrylic acid<br>
absorption column having a number of theoretical plate of<br>
23 found by calculation to absorb acrylic acid with water<br>
containing hydroquinone in an amount corresponding to 200<br>
mass ppm relative to the amount of acrylic acid in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas introduced into the absorption column.<br>
When the amount of the absorbing water was adjusted with<br>
the column top temperature of the acrylic acid absorption<br>
column set at 67°C and the top pressure thereof set at 0.11<br>
MPa (absolute pressure), the absorption column produced<br><br>
bottom liquid having an acrylic acid concentration of 90 wt. %.<br>
The gas discharged via the top of the absorption column<br>
except the recycle gas was discharged as waste gas to the<br>
out side of system. The recycle gas was introduced into a<br>
cooling column to induce partial condensation of low boiling<br>
substances by cooling and then circulated to the reactor.<br>
The whole amount of the condensate and the absorbing water<br>
were mixed and returned to the absorption column. The cooling<br>
temperature was set at a level at which the H2O concentration<br>
in the first reaction zone reached the prescribed value.<br>
Under the stabilized conditions acquired after the<br>
elapse of about 100 hours following the start of the reaction,<br>
the operation was analyzed to collect data. Consequently,<br>
the cooling temperature of the recycle gas was found to be<br>
56.9°C, the recycle ratio 24.2%, the acid concentration at<br>
the inlet to the first reaction zone (the sum of the amounts<br>
of acrylic acid and acetic acid in mol ppm at the inlet to<br>
the first reaction zone) 150 ppm, and the yield of acrylic<br>
acid 86.8% and the acrylic acid loss ratio 2.80%. The outlined<br>
procedures of working examples and comparative examples and<br>
the results thereof are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
An operation was performed with the same apparatus under<br>
the same conditions as in Example 1 with the exception of<br>

at the inlet of the first reaction zone at 2. 5 vol% and adjusting<br>
the amount of the absorbing water so as to set the acrylic<br>
acid concentration in the bottom liquid of the absorption<br>
column at 90 wt. %.<br>

the inlet to the first reaction zone 30 ppm, the yield of<br>
acrylic acid 86.5% and the acrylic acid loss ratio 1.96%.<br>

of acrylic acid 86.3%, and the acrylic acid loss ratio 3.52%.<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>

the same conditions as in Example 1 with the exception of<br>
changing the place of installation of the cooling device from<br>
the recycle gas line to the line for discharging the gas via<br>
the top of the absorption column, adjusting the flow rates<br>
of relevant gases and the cooling temperatures so as to set<br>
the concentrations of propylene, O2, and H2O respectively at<br>
8 vol%, 14.4 vol%, and 5.0 vol%, and adjusting the amount<br>

at 90 wt. %.<br>
Under the stabilized conditions acquired after the<br>
elapse of about 100 hours following the start of the reaction,<br>

of the column was found to be 57.8 °C, the recycle ratio 25.1%,<br>
the acid concentration at the inlet to the first reaction<br>
zone2, 420ppm, the yield of acrylic acid 84. 6%, and the acrylic<br>

(Example 4)<br>
An operation was performed with the same apparatus under<br>
the same conditions as in Example 1 with the exception of<br>
changing the number of theoretical plate of the acrylic acid<br>
absorption column (found by calculation) to 10, setting the<br>
top temperature of the absorption column at 63°C, adjusting<br>
the relevant flow rates and the cooling temperatures so as<br>
to set the concentrations of propylene, O2, and H2O respectively<br>
at 8 vol%, 14.4 vol%, and 4.0 vol%, and adjusting the amount<br>
of the absorbing water so as to set the acrylic acid<br>

at 75 wt. %.<br>
Under the stabilized conditions acquired after the<br>
elapse of about 100 hours following the start of the reaction,<br>

50.2°C, the recycle ratio 25.2%, the acid concentration at<br>
the inlet to the first reaction zone 50 ppm, the yield of<br>
acrylic acid 86.7%, and the acrylic acid loss ratio 1.59%.<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
An operation was performed under the same conditions<br>
as in Example 1 with the exception of using the same apparatus<br>
as in Example 4, supplying the recycle gas to the first reaction<br>
zone without being cooled meanwhile, adjusting the flow rates<br>
of relevant gases so as to set the concentrations of propylene<br>
and 02 respectively at 8 vol% and 14.4 vol%, and adjusting<br>
the amount of the absorbing water so as to set the acrylic<br>
acid concentration in the bottom liquid of the absorption<br>
column at 75 wt. %. The concentration of H20 introduced into<br>
the first reaction zone was 6.2 vol%.<br>
Under the stabilized conditions acquired after the<br><br>
elapse of about 100 hours following the start of the reaction,<br>

the recycle ratio was found to be 25. 0%, the acid concentration<br>
at the inlet to the first reaction zone 4 60 ppm, the yield<br>
of acrylic acid 86.7%, and the acrylic acid loss ratio 1. 93%.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
An operation was performed with the same apparatus under<br>
the same conditions as in Comparative Example 1 with the<br>
exception of disposing a dehumidifying device in the raw<br>
material air line to dehumidify the air introduced into the<br>
first reaction zone, supplying the recycle gas to the first<br>
reaction zone without being cooled meanwhile, adjusting the<br>
flow rates of relevant gases so as to set the concentrations<br>

concentration at the inlet to the first reaction zone 960<br>
ppm, the yield of acrylic acid 86.3%, and the acrylic acid<br>
loss ratio 2.95%.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
An operation was performed with the same apparatus under<br>
the same conditions as in Example 2 with the exception of<br>
disposing a dehumidifying device in the raw material air line<br>
to dehumidify the air introduced into the first reaction zone,<br><br>
cooling the recycle gas to the same temperature of 34.1°C as<br>
in Example 2 and supplying the cooled recycle gas to the first<br>
reaction zone, adjusting the flow rates of relevant gases<br>
so as to set the concentrations of propylene, O2, and-<br>
H2O respectively at 8 vol%, 14.4. vol%, and 4.0 vol%, and<br>
adjusting the amount of the absorbing water so as to set the<br>
acrylic acid concentration in the bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column at 90 wt. %. The concentration of H20<br>
introduced into the first reaction zone at 18 vol%.<br>
Under the stabilized conditions acquired after the<br>
elapse of about 100 hours following the start of the reaction,<br>
the operation was analyzed to collect data. Consequently,<br>
the recycle ratio was found to be 24. 9%, the acid concentration<br>
at the inlet to the first reaction zone 20 ppm, the yield<br>
of acrylic acid 8 6.8%, and the acrylic acid loss ratio 1.70%.<br><br><br><br>
(Results)<br>
(1) In working examples and comparative examples, the<br>
recycle ratios were invariably in the neighborhood of 25 vol%<br>
and the amounts of discarded gas showed no change. It is,<br>
therefore, evident that the variation of the acrylic acid<br><br>
loss ratio correlated with the concentrations of acrylic acid<br>
contained in the discarded gas.<br>
(2)	Comparison of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
reveals that in Example 1, since the amount of a water component<br>
contained in the recycle gas was decreased by cooling the<br>
recycle gas, the acrylic acid loss ratio could be decreased<br>
when the acrylic acid-containing solution of a fixed<br>
concentration was prepared.<br>
(3)	Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were equal in<br>
the top temperature of the absorption column, the number of<br>
theoretical plate, acrylic acid concentration in the<br>
absorption column, recycle gas cooling temperature, and<br>
amount of water component in the gas supplied to the reactor<br>
and were different in respect that the recycle gas was<br>
exclusively cooled in the former case and the discharged gas<br>
was wholly cooled in the latter case. Since the acrylic acid<br>
loss ratio was in proportion to the concentration of acrylic<br>
acid contained in the discharged gas from the absorption column<br>
as mentioned above, Comparative Example 2 produced higher<br>
acrylic acid concentrations in gas phase in both the acids<br>
at the inlet of the reactor and the discharged gas from the<br>
absorption column than Example 1. Since the acrylic acid<br>
concentrations of the bottom liquid of the absorption column<br>
were invariably 90 wt. %, the amount of acrylic acid not<br>
absorbed with the aqueous absorbent was large, namely the<br>
ratio of absorption of acrylic acid was low in Comparative<br>
Example 2, The ratio of reaction of acrylic acid was 86.8%<br>
in Example 1 and it was 84.6% in Comparative Example 1,<br>
indicating a decrease in the latter case. The cooling of the<br>
whole amount of the discharged gas from the absorption column<br>
resulted in changing the acid concentration at the inlet to<br>
the reactor and lowering the ratio of reaction of acrylic<br><br>
acid. Example 1 cooled the recycle gas exclusively and<br>
Comparative Example 1 cooled both the recycle gas and the<br>
waste gas. Thus, Example 1 enjoyed a decrease in the utilities<br>
required for cooling.<br>
(4)	Example 2 which decreased the amount of water<br>
component in the recycle gas by cooling the gas to a lower<br>
temperature than in Example 1 enjoyed a further decrease of<br>
the amount of water component introduced into the reactor<br>
and a further decrease of the acrylic acid loss ratio.<br>
(5)	Example 3 which did not circulate the condensate<br>
to the absorption column equaled Example 1 in the acrylic<br>
acid loss ratio and in the ratio of reaction of acrylic acid.<br>
(6)	Comparison of Example 4 which cooled the recycle<br>
gas and controlled the concentration of acrylic acid in the<br>
bottom liquid of the absorption column to 75 wt. % and<br>
Comparative Example 3 which did not cool the recycle gas reveals<br>
that Comparative Example 3 had a higher acrylic acid loss<br>
ratio than Example 4. The effect of this cooling on the acrylic<br>
acid loss ratio showed the same tendency to the effect of<br>
the presence or absence of the cooling of the recycle gas<br>
on the production of the acrylic acid of a concentration of<br>
90 wt. % in the bottom liquid of the column.<br><br>
(7)	Example 5 which introduced the air dehumidified in<br>
advance with the object of lowering the amount of water<br>
component introduced into the first reaction zone attained<br>
the acrylic acid loss ratio lower than Comparative Example<br>
1 which did not perform a treatment of dehumidification.<br>
(8)	Example 6 which cooled the recycle gas and introduced<br>
the air dehumidified in advance enjoyed the lowest<br>
concentration of acid at the inlet to the reactor and the<br>
lowest acrylic acid loss ratio in all the samples having an<br>
acrylic acid concentration of 90 wt. % in the bottom liquid<br><br>
of the column.<br><br>

13.	An apparatus for the production of (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
substantially as herein described, particularly with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution in the absorption<br>
column is decided by the amount of acrylic acid and the amount<br>
of a solvent to be supplied therein. To prepare the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of a high concentration, therefore,<br><br>
it suffices to lower the amount of the solvent. An attempt<br>
to obtain bottom liquid which have an acrylic acid<br>
concentration of not less than 70 wt. %, however, is not easily<br>
carried out because the loss of acrylic acid through the top<br>
of the absorption column increases when the amount of the<br>
solvent for absorbing acrylic acid supplying to the absorption<br>
column is decreased. The present inventors have pursued a<br>
study in search of conditions which permit preparation of<br>
an acrylic acid-containing solution of high concentration<br>
while lowering the loss of acrylic acid. They have perfected<br>
this invention as a result. Specifically, they have found<br>
that when the amount of the water contained in the raw material<br>
is decreased, the amount of the water introduced into the<br>
reactor can be decreased and the (meth) acrylic acid solution<br>
of high concentration is obtained while the loss of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid is allayed, and that while part of the<br>
gas emanating from the absorption column is recycled to the<br>
reactor, the (meth)acrylic acid solution of high<br>
concentration is obtained as suppressing the loss of<br>
(meth) acrylic acid by decreasing the amount of a condensable<br>
substance in the recycled gas being introduced via the reactor<br>
in the form of a gas again into the absorption column excluding<br>
no change in the amount of the condensable substance in the<br>
waste gas discharged from the system. This invention has been<br>
perfected based on this knowledge.<br>
Accordingly, the instant invention provides a method for<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid by a procedure comprising the<br>
steps of subjecting raw material such as herein described of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid to a reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation, absorbing (meth)acrylic acid, separating a gas<br><br>
discharged from the absorbing step into a recycle gas such as<br>
herein described and a waste gas, cooling said recycle gas<br>
and circulating the recycle gas to a reactor and discarding<br>
the waste gas to outside of the system, wherein the<br>
concentration of a condensable substance such as herein<br>
described contained in the recycle gas is lower than the<br>
concentration of a condensable substance contained in the<br>
waste gas, and said cooling step induces condensation of at<br>
least part of a condensable substance contained therein in<br>
the form of a condensate and consequently lowers the<br>
concentration of the condensable substance contained in said<br>
gas, and removes water content or acid content or both from<br>
the recycle gas.</td>
