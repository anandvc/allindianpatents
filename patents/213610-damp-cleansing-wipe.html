THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
DAMP CLEANSING WIPE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
VDQ| ' v<br><br>
DAMP CLEANSING WIPE<br>
The invention concerns low-cost, easily manufacturable disposable single use, substantially damp, cleansing articles.<br>
Personal cleansing and conditioning products have traditionally been marketed in a variety of forms such as bar soaps, creams, lotions, and gels.  These formulations have attempted to satisfy a number of criteria to be acceptable to consumers.  These criteria include cleansing effectiveness, skin feel, skin mildness and lather volume. Ideal personal cleansers should gently cleanse the skin or hair, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin or hair overly dry after frequent use.<br>
A series of granted and pending patent applications have been published by Procter &amp; Gamble describing disposable personal cleansing products purportedly addressing many of the aforementioned functionality concerns.  These products are substantially dry articles having deposited onto a woven or non-woven cloth a cleansing composition of" surfactant, structurant, skin conditioning agent and other performance ingredients.  The term "substantially dry" is defined in most of these documents as maximum 10%, but in some instances as high as 15% water.  Particularly preferred levels are 5% or less.  A commercial embodiment sold in the<br>
U.S. is Olay  Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths having water<br>
levels of 3-4% by weight of the total cloth article.  The technology is described in the following patents.<br>
2-<br><br>
U.S-. Patent 5,951,991 (Wagner et al.) focuses on providing the substrate with a conditioning emulsion separately impregnated from the lathering surfactant onto the cloth substrate.  U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) emphasizes impregnation of oil soluble conditioning agents.  WO 99/55303 (Albacarys et al.) describes skin care actives formulated with the cleansing composition.<br>
Manufacturing processes for these products are reported in U.S. Patent 5,952,043 and U.S. Patent 5,863,663, both to Mackey et al.  These patents teach use of a continuous lipid phase with a high melting waxy material deposited onto the wipe substrate.  The material is intended.to be sufficiently brittle so as to be easily disrupted by low shear contact (e.g. during wiping of the skin) to readily release an internal skin conditioning phase, yet the material is required to be sufficiently: tough to avoid premature release of the internal phase during the rigors of processing.  A problem with this technology is that through compromise the continuous external lipid phase/internal polar phase is neither sufficiently .robust, for,processing â–  and...handling- nor sufficiently releasable under wash conditions to allow efficient release of conditioning agent onto the skin.<br>
More recent publications in this area include WO 01/08542 Al (Cen et al.) , WO 01/08655 Al (Phipps et al.) , WO 01/08656 Al (Smith et al.), WO 01/08657 Al (Lorenzi et al.) and WO 01/08658 Al (Cawkwell et al.), all to Procter and Gamble. These documents extend the wipe technology to bonded double layer substrates of contrasting textural properties. A rougher of the two sides may act as a gripping surface while the other may be used for delivering cleansing aids. The<br><br>
articles are-described -as being substantially dry defined as a Moisture Retention ratio of less than 0.95 gms.  The ratio reports weight for total non-bound liquids in the article but is not synonymous with water content.  Water levels are not defined.<br>
Our evaluations of dry wipes produced by the known technology has indicated slow latherability.  We attribute the problem to the relatively low water content.  A need exists for a cleansing wipe of improved foamability and one which can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a disposable cleansing product which upon contact with water rapidly lathers and generates a rich long lasting foam.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a disposable cleansing product having a cleansing composition coatable onto a flexible wiping cloth in a process that minimizes foam generation during manufacture.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to provide a disposable cleansing product which may include an impregnated composition allowing for improved manufacturability, better aesthetics and increased latherability.<br>
These and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following summary and disclosure.<br>
4<br><br>
A substantially damp cleansing product is provided which includes:<br>
(i)   a water insoluble substrate; and<br>
(ii)  a cleansing composition impregnated onto the substrate including:<br>
(a)	at least one lathering surfactant present in an amount sufficient to foam;<br>
(b)	water; and<br>
wherein the water is present at greater than 15% by weight of the product, but no higher than 40%, and a water-binding agent is present in an amount sufficient to result in a composition having a water activity less than 0.977 but no lower than 0.001.<br>
Now it has been found that improved lather quality/stability, foam height and imparted skinfeel is achieved through the presence of a water-binding agent in such'amounts" whrch-would "lower water activity to a range from less than 0.977, preferably less than about 0.96, more preferably less than about 0.94 and optimally less than about 0.90.  Water activity should be at least 0.001, preferably at least about 0.50, and optimally greater than about 0.80.<br>
Illustrative water-binding agents are polyols and inorganic salts.  The polyols include glycols, polyglycols, saccharides and polysaccharides.  Typical polyols include glycerol (also known as glycerin), polyalkylene glycols and<br>
5<br><br>
moxeâ€žpreferably. alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof.<br>
For best results the water-soluble binding agent is preferably glycerin.  Also particularly preferred are polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 2,0 00,000, with PEG-9M and PEG-14M being preferred) and hexylene glycol.  In certain types of compositions the latter binding agent may be inappropriate and therefore polyols other than hexylene glycol should be utilized.<br>
Saccharides useful as binding agents for purposes of this invention include dextrose, sucrose, mannose, lactose and fructose and functionalized derivatives thereof including<br>
key C2.-C40 alkyl esters, alkyl ethers, sulphates,<br>
carboxylates and phosphate derivatives.<br>
Among the suitable inorganic salts are the alkali metal, ammonium, alkaline earth and other metal salts of halides, phosphates, sulphates and any combinations thereof. Particularly preferred is sodium chloride as an inorganic binding agent.<br>
The amount of water-soluble binding agent may range anywhere from about 0.1 to about 60%, preferably from about 1 and about 30% by weight of the composition.<br>
b<br><br>
Water activity is defined as the vapor pressure of water in a system relative to the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.  It is also the equilibrium relative humidity of the air surrounding the system at the same temperature.  A product with no "free" water will have a water activity of'0.000.  A product such as a pure water coated towelette will have a water activity of 1.000.  An instrument for direct measurement of water activity is sold under the name of AquaLab by Decagon Devices Inc., of Pullman, Washington.<br>
The cleansing products of the present invention may have a water content ranging from greater than 15% to about 40%, preferably from about 20% to about 35%, and optimally from about 25% to about 30% by weight of the cleansing product.<br>
Further, the impregnated compositions used in the present invention will have a viscosity ranging from about 7 0 to about 300,000 cp (centipoise).  Thickness is measured on a Haake CV 20. Rheometer with 30 mm profiled parallel plates at 23Â°C.  A preferred, viscosity range is from about 100 to about 250,000 cp, more preferably from about 150 to about 10 0,000, even more preferably from about 200 to about 50,000 cp, and optimally from about 400 to about 1,000 cp.<br>
An essential element of compositions according to the present invention is a lathering surfactant.  By a "lathering surfactant" is meant a surfactant, which when combined with water and mechanically agitated generates a foam or lather.  Preferably, these lathering surfactants should be mild, which means that they must provide sufficient cleansing or detersive benefits but not overly<br>
7<br><br>
dry the skin or hair, and yet meet the lathering criteria described above.<br>
The products of the present invention typically include at least one lathering surfactant in an amount from about 0.5% to about 60%, preferably from about 0.75% to about 40%, and more preferably from about 1% to about 2 0%, based on the weight of the impregnated composition.<br>

A necessary element of the present invention is that of a water insoluble substrate.  By "water insoluble" is meant the substrate does not dissolve or readily break apart upon immersion in water.  A wide variety of materials can be used as the substrate.  The following non-limiting characteristics are desirable: (i) sufficient wet strength for use, (ii) sufficient abrasivity, (iii) sufficient loft and porosity, (iv) sufficient thickness, and (v) appropriate size.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable insoluble substrates which meet the above criteria include non-woven substrates, woven substrates, hydro-entangled substrates, air entangled substrates and the like.  Preferred embodiments employ non-woven substrates since they are economical and readily available in a variety of materials.  By non-woven is meant that the layer is comprised of fibers which are not woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a sheet, particularly a tissue.  The fibers can either be random (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one direction).  Furthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of materials both natural and synthetic.  By natural is meant<br>
12-<br><br>
that the materials are derived from plants, animals, insects or byproducts.  By synthetic is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any of the common synthetic or natural' textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>

Anywhere from 1 to 100, preferably from 5 to 5 0 single wipes may be stored within a dispensing pouch or container, preferably a moisture impermeable pouch or container. During storage and between dispensing, the pouch or container is preferably resealable.  Single wipe containing pouches may also be employed.<br>
The water insoluble substrates of the present invention can comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness.  The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or-from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate layers of the substrate can be manufactured to have different colors, thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces. Although the present invention may be suitable for substrates with two or more layers having different texture and abrasiveness, the best effectiveness of the damp system can be found-with single or multiple layered substrates of identical construction.<br>
The amount of	impregnating composition relative to the<br>
substrate may	range from about 20:1 to 1:20, preferably from<br>
10:1 to about	1:10 and optimally from about 2:1 to about 1:2<br>
by weight.<br>
Impregnating compositions of the present invention may also include silicones of a volatile and non-volatile variety. Typical volatile silicones are the cyclomethicones commercially available as Dow Corning 244, 245, 344 and 345. Linear volatile dimethicones are also suitable.  Non-<br>
\h<br><br>
volatile silicones include polydimethyl siloxanes of a viscosity greater than 2 centistoke and silicone copolyols also known as dimethicone copolyol for which Dow Corning 193 is a commercial source.

The disposable, single use personal care cleansing products of the present invention are manufactured' by separately or simultaneously adding onto or impregnating into a water insoluble substrate the cleansing composition including lathering surfactants and conditioners, wherein the resulting product is damp.  By "separately" is meant that the surfactants and the conditioners can be added sequentially, in any order without first being combined together.  By "simultaneously" is meant that the surfactants and conditioners can be added at the same time, with or without first, being combined together.<br>
The surfactant, conditioners, water-binding agents and any other optional ingredients can be .added onto or impregnated into the water insoluble substrate by any means known to those skilled in the art. For example, addition can be through spraying, laser printing, splashing, dipping, soaking, or coating.<br>

The drop in water activity with glycerin is particularly ' exceptional.  Towelettes coated with glycerin performed extremely well in foaming tests as described below.<br>
The base formula (75%) with glycerin (25%) was coated onto a substrate at 2.0 grams coating per 2.0 grams rayon/polyester sheet (152 mm by 190 mm area).<br>
Lather quality/stability comparisons were conducted on the glycerin fortified towelette and two commercial products. A modified Ross-Miles foam tester was employed. The towelettes lather parameters were measured on 3 cloths in 200 ml of water.  Results are reported in the Table below.<br>

Based upon the...findings reported in Table IV, there was a significant preference for the glycerin/high water towelette.<br>
The Olayw towelette with only 3-4% water and a high water<br>
activity constant did not provide a sufficiently creamy lather, lathered slower, left skin feeling less soft and less moisturized than the towelette of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
More than 60 different materials were evaluated as water-binding agents for use in the compositions for impregnation into the towelettes.  Most did not work including gums, silicas, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxides, aluminum carbonates, mica and calcium chloride.  These materials either exhibited a too high water activity or thickened the compositions sufficiently to be unusable with the towelettes. Table VI lists materials which were effective as water-binding agents according to the present invention.  Table V is the base formula into which the "water-binding agent" was combined.  The base formula was set as a 100% value.  For instance,, to accommodate 5% of a water-binding agent, 95% of the total composition was base formula.  In this manner all ingredients were maintained proportionally equivalent.<br>
