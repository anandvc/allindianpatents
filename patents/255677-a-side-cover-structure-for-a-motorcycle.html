				<td>[Technical Field of the Invention] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle, and more particularly to a side cover structure for a motorcycle in which an engine is mounted on the frame body and is exposed to the outside, a fuel tank is arranged over the engine, a seat behind the fuel tank, and a side cover below the seat to cover the side of a vehicle space directly under the seat. <br>
[Background art] [0002]<br>
Generally, in comparison with a so-called full cowl motorcycle in which most of the engine is covered by the cowl, a type of motorcycle in which most of the engine is exposed to the outside is advantageous in that the vehicle can be made smaller and the engine heat can easily be dissipated. However, even in the former type motorcycle, it has been known to cover on-board equipment such as an air cleaner, a rear suspension and the like, which are disposed under the seat with a side cover. Also, it has been known to cover a fuel supply device such as a carburetor and the like with a front cover member which is provided separately from the side cover. (See, for example, Patent Literature 1 cited below.)<br>
[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Patent Publication No. 3367855 [Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
 [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
However, in the prior art structure described above, since the side cover covering the air cleaner and the like under the seat and the front cover covering the carburetor and the like under the fuel tank are respectively made as independent parts, the number of component parts increases, the cost becomes high, and the design packaging is aesthetically problematic as side cover and the front cover member lack the feel of design unity. Also, in the prior art structure, since the side of the upper part of the engine is exposed without being covered by the front cover member, the engine heat is at times conveyed to the legs of the operator of the motorcycle when the operator rides with a knee grip technique in which the left and right knees tightly grip the motorcycle. [0004]<br>
The present invention was made under the circumstances described above, and its purpose is to provide a side cover structure in the motorcycle which solves aforesaid problems in the prior art structure by a simplified structure. [Means for solving the problems] [0005]<br>
In order to accomplish the aforesaid purpose, in a side cover structure for a motorcycle in which an engine is mounted on a frame body in a state of being exposed to the outside, a fuel tank is arranged above the engine, a seat is placed behind the fuel tank, and a side cover is arranged under the seat, the invention according to claim 1 is characterizedby a constitution<br>
in which the side cover structure includes a cover main body covering a side of a space in the frame body just under the seat and a tapered extension section which extends as one piece from the front end of the cover main body toward a head pipe with a tapered end pointing f orwardly and covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the fuel tank, the tapered extension covering the side of the upper part of the engine.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention according to claim 2 is characterized, in addition to the features of the invention in claim 1, by a constitution in which the tapered extension section of the side cover is formed such that the lower rim of the tapered extension section extends nearly linearly to point toward the head pipe in the vehicle side view.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 3 is characterized, in addition to the features of the invention in any of claim 1 or claim 2, by a constitution in which a fuel supply device for supplying fuel to the engine is arranged under the fuel tank in the proximity of the upper part of the engine, and the tapered extension section of the side cover extends forwardly farther than the fuel supply device so as to cover the side of the fuel supply device.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized, in addition to the features of the invention in any of claim 1 through claim 3, by a constitution in which an operating lever to open and close a fuel valve provided in a fuel supply pipe allowing<br>
communicating the fuel tank and the fuel supply device is arranged to face an opening formed in the side cover.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention according to claim 5 is characterized, in addition to the features of the invention in any of claim 1 through claim 4, by a constitution in which the cover main body of the side cover covers the side of the air cleaner and the rear suspension which are respectively arranged under the seat.<br>
[Effects of the invention]<br>
[0010]<br>
According to the inventions in respective claims as described above, since the side cover is composed of the cover main body which covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the seat and the tapered extension section which extends as one piece from the front end of the cover main body toward the head pipe with a tapered end pointing forwardly and covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the fuel tank, which tapered extension section covering the side of the upper part of the engine, the heat from the engine can be effectively prevented from being conducted to the legs of the operator when the operator is riding with the knee grip technique by the heat shield effect of the tapered cover extension. Further, since the tapered cover extension section is integrally extended from the cover main body of the side cover to make the side cover itself as a one-piece unit, a cost reduction can be accomplished by a reduced number of component parts, and the side cover can be providedwhich offers an aesthetically pleasant, unitary look as a whole and is excellent in merchantability.<br>
 [0011]<br>
According to the invention in claim 2, since the lower rim of the tapered extension section that extends nearly linearly points toward the head pipe in the vehicle side view, the side cover can gain a solid look as though it were a main frame, and more particularly a twin-tube frame, to further improve the styling look. [0012]<br>
According to the invention in claim 3, not only the upper part of the engine but also the side of the fuel supply device arranged in the proximity of the upper part of the engine can be aesthetically covered by the tapered extension section of the side cover, and a dedicated cover for covering the fuel supply device becomes unnecessary. [0013]<br>
According to the invention in claim 4, since the operating lever for opening and closing the fuel valve is arranged to face the opening formed in the side cover, the open-close operation of the operating lever of the fuel valve can be performed without difficulty even if the tapered extension section of the side cover is extended far toward the head pipe, and the piping and the fuel valve around the operating lever can be aesthetically covered. [0014]<br>
According to the invention in claim 5, since the cover main body of the side cover covers the side of the air cleaner and the rear suspension respectively arranged under the seat, the air cleaner and others which are the primary subject for<br>
covering by the side cover can be aesthetically covered.<br>
[Preferred Embodiments of the Invention]<br>

 [0016]<br>
Fig.' 1 through Fig. 4 in the accompanying drawings illustrate one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 1 is an overall side view of the motorcycle. Fig. 2 is a fragmentary enlarged side view (an enlarged view of the area pointed by the arrow 2 in Fig. 1) . Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a side cover alone. Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view taken along the 4-4 line in Fig. 2. Fig. 5 is an enlarged sectional view taken along the 5-5 line in Fig. 2. Fig. 6 is an enlarged sectional view taken along the 6-6 line in Fig. 2.<br>
[0017]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, an engine E and its intake and exhaust systems, a fuel tank T, a fuel supply system for conducting fuel from the tank T to the engine side and others are mounted on a frame body F. At the front end of the frame body F, a front wheel Wf is supported through a front fork 1 having a handle bar 2 on its top. At an approximate lower middle section of the frame body F, a swing arm SA supporting a rear wheel Wr is vertically pivotally supported, and a rear suspension R is interposed between the swing arm SA and the frame body F. The driving power of the engine E is transmitted through a chain drive mechanism 10 to the rear wheel Wr.<br>
[0018]<br>
The frame body F comprises a head pipe H which steerably supports the front fork 1, a down tube DT which downwardly extends from the head pipe H to pass the front side of the engine E, a main frame MF which rearwardly and slightly downwardly extends from the head pipe H to pass over and behind the engine E, a seat tube ST the front end of which is fixedly connected to the middle section of the main frame MF and the rear end of which extends rearwardly, and a back tube BT which fixedly connects the middle section of the seat tube ST and the rear section of the main frame MF. The engine E is connected and supported between the rear section of the main frame MF and the lower section of the down tube DT. A tandem seat S is supported on the seat tube ST. [0019]<br>
The bottom of the fuel tank T is supported on and astride the main frame MF. The upper end of the rear suspension Rispivotally connected to the seat tube ST, and an air cleaner A is also fixedly supported thereby. The rear suspension and the air cleaner A are arranged in front of and under the seat S. [0020]<br>
A step holder 3 is integrally attached to a suitable location of the frame body F (under the main frame MF in the illustrated embodiment), and a step 4 is attached to the end of the step holder 3 for supporting the foot of the rear seat occupant. Also, a muffler support bracket 3a supporting an exhaust muffler M, which will be described later, is integrally attached to a suitable location of the frame body F. A lower<br>
cover 5 is detachably attached to a lower and outer portion of the main frame MF to cover the side of the space in the frame body directly behind the engine E. The lower cover 5 is located adjacent to the lower end of the side cover C, which will be described later, and aesthetically covers the space under the main frame MF, the front end of the back tube BT, and the base of the step holder 3.<br>
[0021]<br>
The engine E comprises a cylinder block CB joined with a cylinder head CH on its top and a crankcase CR integrally formed underneath the cylinder block CB, and is mounted on the frame body F with most of the engine E exposed to the outside. The crankcase CR doubles as the transmission case, and has a rearward protrusion CRa which protrudes rearwardly beyond the cylinder block CB. The crankcase CR contains in it a crankshaft and a speed change gear mechanism (neither of them shown in the drawings) interlocked with the crankshaft, and the output shaft of the speed change gear mechanism is interlocked with the chain drive mechanism 10.<br>
[0022]<br>
An exhaust pipe EX extends forwardly from the front face of the cylinder head CH. The exhaust pipe EX gradually turns around in the vicinity of the down tube DT to extend rearwardly to pass under the engine E, and an exhaust muffler M which is slightly swept up toward the rear is connected to its rear end.<br>
[0023]<br>
An intake pipe IP allowed to communicated with an intake port in the cylinder head CH is connected to the rear of the<br>
CH. The air cleaner A is connected to the upstream end of the intake pipe IP, and, in its intermediate section, a carburetor 6 as a fuel supply device is provided to supply fuel to the engine E. The intake pipe IP and the carburetor 6 are both arranged directly under the fuel tank T, and the fuel bowl of the carburetor 6 and the fuel tank T are connected by a fuel supply line L. A fuel valve V is interposed in a way of the fuel supply line L, and the fuel valve V is operably provided with an operating lever 7 for opening and closing the fuel valve V.<br>
[0024]<br>
A pair of left and right side covers C is arranged in front of and below the seat S, and a rear cowl 9 which is integrally formed with a rear fender 8 is arranged behind and below the seat S.<br>
[0025]<br>
Referring to Fig. 2 through Fig. 6, a specific constitution of the side cover C will be described. Each of the side covers C comprises a cover main body Cm which covers the space in the frame body directly under the seat S and a tapered extension section Ca which extends as one piece from the front end of the cover main body Cm toward the head pipe H with a tapered end pointing forwardly and covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the fuel tank.<br>
[0026]<br>
In a vehicle side view, the lower rim Cad of the tapered extension section Ca is formed such that it extends nearly linearly to point toward the head pipe H (that is, slanting upwardly in its fore part) , while the upper rim Cau of the tapered<br>
extension section Ca extends generally horizontally along the front lower rim of the seat S and the lower rim of the fuel tank T as its middle section slightly curves up and down. The front end of the lower rim Cad and the front end of the upper rim Cau of the tapered extension section Ca are connected with each other near the head pipe H to form an edge between them to give an impression that the front end of the tapered extension section Ca goes on to extend straight to the head pipe H under the front lower part of the fuel tank T. Because of this, the side cover C assumes a look giving a strong and solid feel as though it were a main frame, and more particularly a twin-tube frame, to improve the aesthetic styling and merchantability. Note that such an effect becomes more prominent if the side cover C is painted with a metallic paint. [0027]<br>
The side cover C is detachably fixed to, -and supported by suitable locations of the frame body F and the fuel tank T. For example, in the embodiment depicted in the accompanying drawings, a rear part and a lower part of the cover main body Cm are provided respectively with a rear mounting piece Cmr and a lower mounting piece Cmd which are formed integrally with and protrude from the cover main body Cm. The rear mounting piece Cmr and the lower mounting piece Cmd are overlapped with and are fastened down with bolts 15 to flat mounting sections BTr, BTd which are formed integrally with the back tube BT. The back side of the tapered extension section Ca is integrally formed with a plurality of mounting protrusions Cas which are spaced apart in a fore-to-aft direction.  The mounting protrusions Cas<br>
have a shape of a channel in section, and the base 11b of a resilient engagement hook 11 is snapped into a mounting hole 12 formed in its end wall. The resilient engagement hooks 11 are integrally formed with a resilient hook section 11a at their tips, and these resilient engagement hook sections 11a are pressed into through-holes 13 in support arms Ta for resilient engagement which are integrally formed to protrude from the bottom of the fuel tank T and are arranged to be spaced apart longitudinally and transversely.<br>
[0028]<br>
Thus, the cover main body Cm of the side cover C widely and aesthetically covers the side of the air cleaner A and the rear suspension R respectively arranged under the seat S, while the tapered extension section Ca of the side cover C extends farther forwardly than the intake pipe IP, the carburetor 6 and the upper part of the engine E (that is, the top of the rear half of the cylinder head) to cover the upper part of the engine E, the carburetor 6 and others.<br>
[0029]<br>
The tapered extension section Ca is formed with a first elongate through-hole 21 in its rear section and a second nearly circular through-hole 22 in its forward section which faces the operating lever 7 for opening and closing the fuel valve V. The first through-hole 21 is a ventilation hole for releasing heat which is trapped in the interior space of the side cover C, and is formed in any of the left and right side covers C. The second through-hole 22 is formed only in the side cover C on the side (the right-hand side in the embodiment depicted in the<br>
accompanying drawings) where the operating lever 7 is provided. A shallow recess 23 which encloses the first through-hole 21 and extends rearwardly is formed in the outer face of the side cover C to span the tapered extension section Ca and the cover main body Cm, and, because of its presence, not only the aesthetic look of the side cover C is improved, but also, an effect of sucking the heat f rominside the cover is enhancedby the traveling wind passing over the cover surface.<br>
[0030]<br>
Next, the operation of the aforesaid embodiment will be described. Under the operating condition of the engine E, a large quantity of heat is released from its surface. Since, in the present embodiment, no front cowl is provided and most of the engine E is exposed to the outside, the heat dissipation performance is good. Therefore, if there were no side cover C (particularly, the tapered extension section Ca) , which will be described later, the heat from the engine is easily conveyed to the legs of the operator when the operator rides with a knee grip technique in which the left and right knees tightly grip the motorcycle.<br>
[0031]<br>
However, since the side cover C is composed of the cover main body Cm which covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the seat S and the tapered extension section Ca which extends as one piece from the front end of the cover main body Cm toward the head pipe H with a tapered end pointing forwardly and covers the side of the space in the frame body directly under the fuel tank, which tapered extension section<br>
Ca covering at least part of the side of the upper part of the engine E, the heat from the engine E can be effectively prevented from being conducted to the legs of the operator when the operator is riding with the knee grip technique by the heat shield effect of the tapered cover extension Ca. Further, since the tapered cover extension section Ca is integrally extended from the cover main body Cm of the side cover C to make the side cover itself as a one-piece unit, a cost reduction can be accomplished by a reduced number of component parts, and the side cover C can be provided which offers an aesthetically pleasant, unitary look as a whole and is excellent in merchantability.<br>
[0032]<br>
Since the tapered extension section Ca of the side cover C aesthetically covers not only the upper part of the engine E (the top of the cylinder head CH) but also the side of the carburetor 6 and the intake pipe IP arranged in the proximity of the upper part of the engine E, a dedicated cover for covering the carburetor 6 and others becomes unnecessary. Further, since the operating lever 7 for opening and closing the fuel valve V is arranged to face the opening 22 formed in the side cover C (the tapered extension section Ca) , the open-close operation of the operating lever 7 of the fuel valve V can be performed without difficulty even if the tapered extension section Ca of the side cover C is extended far toward the head pipe H, and the piping and the fuel valve V around the operating lever can be aesthetically covered.<br>
[0033]<br>
The embodiment of the present invention has thus far been<br>
described.  However, the present invention can be modified variously in its design without deviating from its essence.<br>
[0034]<br>
For example, in aforesaid embodiment, one with the engine E having the carburetor 6 as the fuel supply device is described. However, in the present invention, it may be with an engine having a fuel injection device as the fuel supply device. In that case, a throttle body of the fuel injection device is arranged in place of the carburetor 6, and a fuel injection nozzle of the fuel injection device is fitted in the cylinder head.<br>
[0035]<br>
Further, although one with the lower cover 5 is arranged adjacent to the underside of the side cover C is described in aforesaid embodiment, the lower cover 5 can be omitted or the lower cover 5 may be integrally formed with the side cover in the present invention.<br>
