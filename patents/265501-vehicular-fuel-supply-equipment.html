fuel pressure regulator is arranged so that the fuel pressure regulator is located<br>
inside the fuel filter cover and is overlapped with the fuel filter cover in a side<br>
view.<br>
|D023]	A workman can easily recognize the fuel filter to be maintained by<br>
almost hiding the fuel pressure regulator from the side with the fuel filter cover.<br>
In addition, as the fuel pressure regulator is arranged so that it is located inside<br>
the fuel filter cover and is overlapped with the fuel  filter cover when the<br>
vehicle is viewed from the side, the plural pipes and hoses such as the fuel<br>
hose connected to the fuel pressure regulator and the fuel filter can be easily<br>
discriminated.     As   the  mutually  close  plural   pipes   and   hoses  are   easily<br>
discriminated, wrong work in the connection of the pipes and hoses can be<br>
avoided.<br>
[0024]	As the fuel filter can be easily recognized and in addition, the pipe<br>
and   hose   connected   to   the   fuel   filter   can   be   easily   discriminated,   the<br>
maintainability of the fuel filter can be enhanced.<br>
[0025]	According to  an  embodiment  of the present  invention,  as the<br>
covering part that includes the hinged part and holds the fuel filter is provided<br>
to the fuel filter cover, the covering part can be opened/closed with the fuel<br><br>
filter cover attached  on the  side of the  vehicle.     As the co\'ering  part  is<br>
openably configured, the fuel filter can be more easily maintained.<br>
[0026]	According to an embodiment of the present invention, as the<br>
connector is covered with the fuel filter cover, dust and others can be almost prevented from adhering to the connection of the connector. Dust and others hardly adhere to the connection of the connector and the connection of the connector can be easily kept clean. As the connection of the connector can be easily kept clean, maintenance can be more easily made without almost caring the contamination of the connection.<br>
[0027]	According to an embodiment of the present invention, the fuel<br>
supply equipment is provided with the fuel filter, the filter cover encircling the fuel filter, the holder attached to the filter cover and the fuel pressure regulator supported by the holder. The fuel pressure regulator and the holder are attached to the filter cover beforehand.<br>
[0028]	The   filter   cover   with   which   the   fuel   pressure   regulator   is<br>
integrated beforehand is prepared.    When the fuel filter is provided on the<br>
side of the body frame in assembling the vehicle, the filter cover and the fuel<br>
pressure regulator can be simultaneously attached to the vehicle by attaching<br>
the filter cover with the fuel pressure regulator integrated to the fuel filter.<br>
[0029]	As the fuel pressure regulator is attached to the filter cover via the<br>
holder beforehand, assembly work can be easily performed when the filter<br>
cover is attached to the vehicle. As the assembly work is easily performed, a<br>
load related to the work can be reduced and work time related to the assembly<br>
of the fuel supply equipment can be reduced. As the work time related to the<br>
assembly can be reduced, productivity related to the assembly can be enhanced,<br>
[0030]	As  the   fuel  pressure  regulator  is   attached  to  the  filter  cover<br><br>
beforehand,   the   possibility   of  wrong   assembly   such   as   mistake   in   the<br>
attachment  of a pipe can be reduced,  compared  with  a  case  that  the fuel<br>
pressure regulator is not attached to the filter cover beforehand.<br>
[0031]	According to an embodiment of the present invention, the cutout<br>
is provided to the holder, and the first shaft releasing part and the second shaft releasing part are provided on the axis of the longitudinal shaft provided to the fuel pressure regulator.<br>
[0032]	When the fuel pressure regulator is set in the holder, the side of<br>
the filter cover of the holder is bored, the first and second shaft releasing parts<br>
which the joining pipe and the return hose respectively connected in the axial<br>
direction of the longitudinal shaft pierce are provided, and the cutout which the<br>
fuel hose connected to the side of the longitudinal shaft pierces is provided.<br>
[0033]	In this case, as the joining pipe pierces the first shaft releasing<br>
part, the return hose pierces the second shaft releasing part and the fuel hose<br>
can pierce the cutout, the fuel pressure regulator can be easily set in the holder.<br>
Therefore, ease of setting the fuel pressure regulator can be enhanced.<br>
[0034]	According to an embodiment of the present invention, the rib for<br>
pressing the fuel pressure regulator along the side of the fuel pressure regulator opposite to the first and second shaft releasing parts is planted on the filter cover.<br>
[0035]	When the fuel pressure regulator is attached to the filter cover, the<br>
fuel pressure regulator is pressed by the holder in which the fuel pressure regulator is set and the rib planted on the filter cover. As the rib is provided to the filler cover, the fuel pressure regulator can be almost prevented from being arranged off a predetermined housed position. Therefore, the fuel pressure regulator can be securely held between the filter cover and the holder<br><br>
without increasing the number of parts.<br>
[0036[	According to an embodiment of the present invention, when tlie<br>
holder that supports the fuel pressure regulator is attached to the filter cover beforehand before the filter cover is attached to the body frame, the holder can be attached to the filter cover without using a fastening member such as a screw. As no fastening member is required, the number of parts can be reduced. In addition, as attachment work is facilitated, ease of attaching the holder to the filter cover can be enhanced.<br>
[0037]	According to an embodiment of the present invention, as the hinge<br>
arm including the hinged part for holding the fuel hose is provided to the filter cover, no guide for the fuel hose is required to be separately provided. As a guide for the fuel hose is not required separately, the number of parts can be reduced.<br>
[0038]	According to  an  embodiment  of the present invention,  as the<br>
convex portion is provided to the filter cover along the periphery of the fuel filter, there is no fear that the fuel filter rattles in a state in which the fuel filter is built in the filter cover. As there is no fear that the fuel filter rattles, the fuel filter can be securely held in the filter cover without increasing the number of parts.<br>

pump, the other end of the return hose 87 is connected to a return orifice of the<br>
fuel tank 33, and the other end of the joining pipe 86 is connected to the fuel<br>
injection system 50.<br>
[00122]	An  assembly flow based  upon FIGS.   15(a) to   19(b)  will  be<br>
described below.<br>
[00123]	FIG. 20 is a flowchart for explaining order in which the fuel<br>
supply equipment according to the  invention is  assembled  and  explains  a<br>
method of assembling the fuel supply equipment 80.<br>
[00124]	In a step nurpber (hereinafter called ST) 01, the fuel hose 84, the<br>
joining pipe 86 and the return hose 87 are connected to the fuel pressure<br>
regulator 85, in ST02, the fuel pressure regulator 85 to which the return hose<br>
87 is connected is attached to the holder 98, and in ST03, the holder 98 to<br>
which the fuel pressure regulator is connected is attached to the filter cover 95.<br>
[00125]	In ST04, the filter cover 95 which is built in ST03 beforehand<br>
and in which the fuel pressure regulator 85 and the holder 98 are integrated is<br>
attached to the fuel filter 83 provided on the side of the body, in ST05, the<br>
covering part 137 is turned inside to co\'er the fuel filter 83, the joining pipe 86<br><br>
is guided, and the covering part 137 is fixed by the screw 163.<br>
[00126]	At this time, the joining pipe 86 is held by the guide part 155<br>
formed in a part of the covering part 1 37.<br>
[00127]	In ST06, the filter cover 95 integrated with the fuel filter 83 is<br>
attached to the battery box 94, in ST07, the hinge arm 143 is bent, and the fuel<br>
hose 84 and the return hose 87 are fastened to the filter cover 95.<br>
[00128]	As the joining pipe 86 is fastened to the filter cover 95 owing to<br>
the guide part 155 and the fuel hose 84 and the return hose 87 are fastened to<br>
the filter cover by the hinge arm 143, the pipe and the hoses can be fastened by<br>
simple work without separately using a banding member.<br>
[00129]	In ST08, the fuel hose 84 and the return hose 87 are connected to<br>
the fuel tank 33 and a series of work related to the assembly of the fuel supply<br>
equipment 80 is completed,<br>
[00130]	When a vehicular assembling process includes a sub-assembly<br>
process in which small parts are sub-assembled and a main assembly process in<br>
which the sub-assembled small parts are attached to a skeleton of the vehicle,<br>
the fuel pressure regulator 85 can be built at the same time as the filter cover<br>
95 is built in the fuel filter 83 in the main assembly process when the fuel filter<br>
83 is provided on the side of the body frame  11  if only the fuel pressure<br>
regulator 85 is built in the holder 98 and the holder 98 is built in the filter<br>
cover 95 in the sub-assembly process beforehand in STOl to ST03.<br>
[00131]	As described above, as the fuel pressure regulator 85 is attached<br>
to the filter cover 95 via the holder 98 in the sub-assembly process beforehand,<br>
assembling work can be facilitated in the main assembly process when the<br>
vehicle 10 is assembled and a load related to the work can be reduced.     If the<br>
load related to the work is reduced, work time related to the assembly of the<br><br>
fuel supply equipment SO can be reduced.     If the assembly work time of the<br>
fuel supply equipment 80 can be reduced in the main assembly process, time<br>
related to the assembly of the fuel supply equipment 80 can be easily inhibited<br>
within the tact time of an assembly line.     If the time related to the assembly of<br>
the fuel supply equipment 80 is easily inhibited within the tact time, lines can<br>
be flexibly organized, can be easily balanced, and productivity in the main<br>
assembly process can be enhanced.     In addition, the possibility  of wrong<br>
assembly such as a pipe is attached by mistake in the main assembly process<br>
can be reduced.<br>
[00132]	Workability when the fuel filter is maintained after the vehicle is<br>
completed will be described below.<br>

regulator 85 is arranged so that it is located inside the filter cover 95 and is<br>
overlapped with the filter cover 95 in a side view.<br>
[00134]	A   workman   can   easily   recognize   the   fuel   filter   83   to   be<br>
maintained by almost hiding the fuel pressure regulator 85 from the side with<br>
the filter cover 95.<br>
[00135]	In addition, as the fuel pressure regulator 85 is arranged so that it<br>
is located inside the filter cover 95 and is overlapped with the filter cover 95<br>
when the vehicle 10 is viewed from the side, the plural pipes and hoses at least<br>
including the fuel hose 84 connected to the fuel pressure regulator 85 and the<br>
fuel  filter 83  can be  easily discriminated.     As the plural pipes  and hoses<br>
mutually arranged close are easily discriminated, wrong work in the connection<br>
of the pipes and hoses can be avoided.<br>
[00136]	As the fuel filter 83 can be easily recognized and in addition, the<br><br>
pipe and the hose connected to the fuel filter 83 can be easily discriminated,<br>
the maintainability of the fuel filter 83 can be enhanced.<br>
[00137]	As also shown in FIGS. 17(a) and (b) and 19(a) and (b), as the<br>
covering part 137 including the hinged part 139 for holding the fuel filter S3 is<br>
provided to the filter cover 95, the covering part 137 can be opened/closed by<br>
only removing the screw 163 in a state which the filter cover 95 is attached on<br>
the side of the vehicle.    As only the covering part 137 is configured to be<br>
openable, the fuel filter 83 can be more easily maintained.<br>
[0D138]	As the connectors  165 are connected to both ends of the fuel<br>
filter 83 and these connectors 165 are covered with the skirts 161 provided to<br>
the upper and lower ends of the filter cover 95, dust and others hardly adhere<br>

the   connection   witb   each   connector   165   and   the   connection   with   each<br>
connector 165 can be easily kept clean.<br>
[00139]	If the connection with each connector  165 can be easily kept<br>
clean, the contamination of the connection is not required to be cared so much<br>
and the maintenance such as a check and replacement of the fuel filter 83 can<br>
be more easily performed.<br>
[00140]	The fuel supply equipment of the present invention is applied to<br>
the motorcycle in the embodiment, however, the invention can be also applied<br>
to a saddle-ride type vehicle, and may be also applied to a general vehicle.<br>
[00141]	In addition, the rib provided to the filter cover for pressing the<br>
fuel pressure regulator may be also omitted.<br>
[00142]	Further, the structure for attaching the holder to the filter cover<br>
may be arbitrary structure if only the fuel pressure regulator is held in the<br>
holder.<br><br>
I00143]	Still further, the hinge arm provided to the filter cover may be<br>
also omitted.<br>
