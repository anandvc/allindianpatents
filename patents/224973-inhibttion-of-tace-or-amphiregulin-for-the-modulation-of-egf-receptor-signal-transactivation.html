Inhibition of TACE or amphiregulin for the modulation of EGF<br>
receptor signal transactivation<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to the modulation of transactivation of receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases by G protein or G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)<br>
mediated signal transduction in a cell or an organism comprising inhibiting<br>
the activity of the metalloprotease TACE/ADAM17 and/or the activity of the<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase Iigand amphiregulin.<br>
Communication between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and EGFR<br>
signalling systems involves cell surface proteolysis of the growth factor<br>
precursor proHB-EGF (1-3). The molecular mechanism of EGFR signal<br>
transactivation in human cancer cells, however, is largely unknown.<br>
Interreceptor communication between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)<br>
and the EGFR occurs in diverse cell types including fibroblasts,<br>
keratinocytes and smooth muscle cells (4). Treatment of cells with GPCR<br>
agonists results in activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and<br>
subsequently leads to the generation of an EGFR-characteristic, intracellular<br>
signal (5). Due to the rapid kinetics of the EGFR transactivation signal and<br>
the fact that release of EGFR ligands was not detectable after GPCR<br>
stimulation, the mechanism of EGFR transactivation was proposed to<br>
exclusively rely on intracellular elements (5, 6). In contrast, a novel<br>
mechanistic concept of EGFR transactivation involves the proteolytic release<br>
of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) at the cell surface of<br>
GPCR stimulated cells (1). HB-EGF, as well as transforming growth factor<br>
alpha (TGFa) and amphiregulin (AR) belong to a family of EGF-like ligands<br>
that directly activate the EGFR. These molecules are synthesized as<br>
transmembrane precursors and are subject to proteolytic cleavage to<br>
produce the soluble and diffusible growth factors (7). The HB-EGF-<br>
dependent mechanism of EGFR signal transactivation has gained further<br>
experimental support by studies on GPCR mitogenic signalling in vascular<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-2-<br>
smooth muscle cells (8), cardiac endothelial cells (9) and cardiomyocytes<br>
(10). Importantly, recent data have implicated EGFR signal transactivation<br>
pathways in the etiology of pathobiological processes such as cystic fibrosis<br>
(3), cardiac (2) and gastrointestinal hypertrophy (11). Furthermore,<br>
increasing evidence argues for a direct correlation between aberrant GPCR<br>
signalling and the development and progression of human cancers (12). We<br>
have recently demonstrated that GPCR-EGFR cross-talk pathways are<br>
widely established in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)<br>
cells and that GPCR agonists such as LPA and carbachol regulate the<br>
proliferative and migratory behavior of HNSCC cells via transactivation of<br>
the EGFR (13). Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR<br>
signal transactivation may thus lead to new strategies for the prevention and<br>
treatment of carcinomas, e.g. squamous cell carcinomas.<br>
Here, we demonstrate that in squamous cell carcinoma cells stimulation with<br>
the GPCR agonists lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or carbachol specifically<br>
results in metalloprotease-dependent cleavage and release of the EGFR<br>
ligand amphiregulin (AR). Moreover, AR gene silencing by small interfering<br>
RNA (siRNA) or inhibition of AR biological activity by neutralizing antibodies<br>
prevents GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, downstream<br>
mitogenic signalling events, activation of Akt/PKB, cell proliferation and<br>
migration. Furthermore, we present evidence that in squamous cell<br>
carcinoma cells blockade of the metalloprotease-disintegrin TACE/ADAM17<br>
by expression of a dominant negative mutant or by RNA interference<br>
suppresses GPCR stimulated AR release and EGFR-dependent cellular<br>
responses. Thus, TACE and/or AR can function as an effector of GPCR-<br>
mediated signalling and therefore represents a key element of the cellular<br>
receptor cross-talk network.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for modulating<br>
transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by G protein or G protein-<br>
coupled receptor mediated signal transduction in a cell comprising inhibiting<br>
the activity of the metalloprotease TACE/ADAM17 and/or the activity of the<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-3-<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase ligand amphiregulin.<br>
The term "inhibition" according to the present invention preferably relates to<br>
a "specific" inhibition, wherein the activity of TACE/ADAM17 and/or<br>
amphiregulin is selectively inhibited, i.e. the activity of other<br>
metalloproteases such as ADAM12 or other receptor tyrosine kinase ligands<br>
such as HB-EGF is not significantly inhibited. By means of selective<br>
inhibition of TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin a highly specific disruption<br>
of receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation may be achieved which is<br>
important for pharmaceutical applications in that the occurance of undesired<br>
side effects may be reduced.<br>
Further, the term "inhibition" preferably relates to a "direct" inhibition,<br>
wherein the inhibitor directly binds to TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin or<br>
a nucleic acid molecule coding therefor. The invention, however, also<br>
encompasses an "indirect" inhibtion wherein the inhibitor does not direptly<br>
bind to TACE/ADAM17 and/or amDhiregulin but to a precursor or metabolite<br>
thereof, particularly the amphiregulin precursor proamphiregulin.<br>
The term "activity" preferably relates to the cleavage of proamphiregulin by<br>
TACE/ADAM17 and/or the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, e.g.<br>
EGFR by amphiregulin. A TACE/ADAM17 inhibitor of the present invention<br>
is preferably capable of inhibiting the cleavage and release of the receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase ligand amphiregulin. An amphiregulin inhibitor of the present<br>
invention is preferably capable of inhibiting biological activity of<br>
amphiregulin, particularly EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, downstream<br>
mitogenic signaling events, activation of Akt/PKB, cell proliferation and/or<br>
migration.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is the use of an inhibitor of the<br>
metalloprotease TACE/ADAM17 and/or an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase ligand amphiregulin for the prevention and/or treatment of a disorder<br>
which is caused by or associated with a transactivation of receptor tyrosine<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-4-<br>
kinases by G protein oder G protein-coupled receptor mediated signal<br>
transduction. The presence of such a type of disorder may be determined by<br>
measuring G protein and/or GPCR expression, e.g. on the mRNA level<br>
(cDNA array analysis, SAGE, Northern blot, etc.) and/or on the protein level<br>
(Western blot analysis, Immunofluorescence Microscopy, in situ<br>
hybridisation techniques, etc.). The presence of such a type of disorder may<br>
also be determined by examining the occurrence of activating mutations in<br>
genomic and/or mRNA molecules encoding G proteins or GPCRs and/or the<br>
presence of virally encoded GPCRs. Further, elevated levels of GPCR<br>
agonists such as LPA and/or amphiregulin in serum and/or disease-affected<br>
tissues may be determined. It should be pointed out that this type of disorder<br>
need not be associated with enhanced receptor tyrosine kinase expression.<br>
For example, the disorder may be a hyperproliferative disorder such as<br>
cancer, e.g. squamous cell carcinoma or another disorder such as a<br>
hyperproliferative skin disease, e.g. psoriasis.<br>
The activity of TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin may be inhibited on the<br>
nucleic acid level, e.g. on the gene level or on the transcription level.<br>
Inhibition on the gene level may comprise a partial or complete gene<br>
inactivation, i.e. by gene disruption. On the other hand, inhibition may occur<br>
on the transcript level, e.g. by application of antisense molecules, .e.g. DNA<br>
molecules, RNA molecules or nucleic acid analogues, ribozymes, e.g. RNA<br>
molecules or nucleic acid analogues or small RNA molecules capable of<br>
RNA interference (RNAi), e.g. RNA molecules or nucleic acid analogues,<br>
directed against TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin mRNA. Antisense<br>
molecules inhibiting the expression of TACE/ADAM17 are for example<br>
described in U.S. Patent 6,180,403, which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Further, the activity of TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin may be inhibited<br>
on the protein level, e.g. by application of compounds which result in a<br>
specific inhibition  of TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin  acitivity.  The<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-5-<br>
inhbition on the protein level may comprise for example the application of<br>
antibodies or antibody fragments directed against TACE/ADAM17 and/or<br>
amphiregulin. The antibodies may be polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal<br>
antibodies, recombinant antibodies, e.g. single chain antibodies or<br>
fragments of such antibodies which contain at least one antigen-binding site,<br>
e.g. proteolytic antibody fragments such as Fab, Fab1 or F(ab')2 fragments or<br>
recombinant antibody fragments such as scFv fragments. For therapeutic<br>
purposes, particularly for the treatment of humans, the application of<br>
chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies or human antibodies is especially<br>
preferred.<br>
The antibodies or antibody fragments may be directed against the<br>
metalloprotease-domain of TACE/ADAM17, or against other parts of the<br>
molecule. The antibodies or antibody fragments may selectively recognize<br>
the mature form of TACE/ADAM17, or the pro-form of TACE/ADAM17 as<br>
shown by immunoprecipitation. Alternatively, the antibodies or antibody<br>
fragments may recognize both the mature form and the pro-form of<br>
TACE/ADAM17.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be generated by known techniques, e.g.<br>
hybridoma techniques as described by Kohler et al. (Nature 256 (1975), 495-<br>
497), Cole et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol. 62 (1984), 109-120) or Kozbor et al. (J.<br>
Immunol. Meth. 81 (1985), 31-42) which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Chimeric or humanized antibodies may be generated by<br>
techniques described by Morrison et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81<br>
(1984), 6851-6855), Neuberger et al. (Nature 312 (1984), 604-608), Takeda<br>
et al. (Nature 314 (1985), 452-454), Jones et al. (Nature 321 (1986), 522-<br>
525), Riechmann et al. (Nature 322 (1988), 323-327), Verhoeyen et al.<br>
(Science 239 (1988), 1534 1536) or Queen et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
86 (1989), 10029-10033), which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Further methods for generating antibodies or antibody fragments are<br>
described by Burton (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 (1991), 11120-11123),<br>
Oriandi et al., (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 (1989), 3833-3837), Winter et<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-6-<br>
al. (Nature 349 (1991), 293-299) or Huse et al. (Science 254 (1989), 1275-<br>
1281), which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Furthermore, low-molecular weight inhibitors of TACE/ADAM17 and/or<br>
amphiregulin may be used. Examples of TACE/ADAM17 inhibitors are<br>
sulfonic acid or phosphinic acid derivatives, e.g. sulfonamides, sulfonamide<br>
hydroxamic adds, phosphinic acid amide hydroxamic acids, e.g. as<br>
described in WO 98/16503, WO 98/16506, WO 98/16514, WO 98/16520,<br>
Mac Pherson et al. (J. Med. Chem. 40, (1997), 2525), Tamura et al. (J. Med.<br>
Chem. 41 (1998), 690), Levin et al. (Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 8 (1998),<br>
2657), Pikul et al. (J. Med. Chem. 41 (1998), 3568), WO 97/18194, EP-A-<br>
0803505, WO 98/08853, WO 98/03166 and EP-A-1279674, which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference. Further inhibitors may be identified by<br>
screening procedures as outlined in detail below.<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the medicament is administered in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition which additionally comprises pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, diluents and/or adjuvants.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention<br>
include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an<br>
effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. A therapeutically effective<br>
dose refers to that amount of the compound that results in amelioration of<br>
symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a patient. Toxicity and therapeutic<br>
efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical<br>
procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g. for determining the<br>
LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose<br>
therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). For any compound used<br>
in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be<br>
estimated initially from cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be<br>
formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range<br>
that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (i.e. the concentration of<br>
the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the growth-<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-7-<br>
factor receptor activity). Such information can be used to more accurately<br>
determine useful doses in humans. The dose ratio between toxic and<br>
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the<br>
ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic<br>
indices are preferred. The exact1 formulation, route of administration and<br>
dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's<br>
condition (see e.g. Fingi et ai., 1975, in The Pharmacological Basis of<br>
Therapeutics", Ch. 1, p. 1).<br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma<br>
levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the receptor<br>
modulating effects, or minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will<br>
vary for each compound but can be estimated from in vitro data, e.g. the<br>
concentration necessary to achieve a 50-90% inhibition of the receptor using<br>
the assays described herein. Compounds should be administered using a<br>
regimen which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the<br>
time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%.<br>
Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual<br>
characteristics and route of administration. In cases of local administration or<br>
selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be<br>
related to plasma concentration.<br>
The actual amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent<br>
on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the<br>
affliction, the manner of administration and the judgement of the prescribing<br>
physician. For antibodies or therapeutically active nucleic acid molecules,<br>
and other compounds e.g. a daily dosage of 0,001 to 100 mg/kg, particularly<br>
0,01 to 10 mg/kg per day is suitable.<br>
Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal,<br>
transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including<br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as<br>
intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-8-<br>
intraocular injections.<br>
Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than a<br>
systematic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into a<br>
solid tumor, often in a depot or sustained release formulation.<br>
Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery<br>
system, for example in a liposome coated with a tumor-specific antibody.<br>
The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the tumor.<br>
Still a further aspect of the present invention is a method for identifying<br>
modulators of receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation by G protein or G<br>
protein-coupled receptor mediated signal transduction, comprising<br>
determining, if a test compound is capable of inhibiting the activity of<br>
TACE/ADAM17 and/or the activity of amphiregulin. This method is suitable<br>
as a screening procedure, e.g. a high-throughput screening procedure for<br>
identifiying novel compounds or classes of compounds which are capable of<br>
modulating G protein signal transduction. Further, the method is suitable as<br>
a validation procedure for characterizing the pharmaceutical efficacy and/or<br>
the side effects of compounds. The method may comprise the use of isolated<br>
proteins, ceil extracts, recombinant cells or transgenic non-human animals.<br>
The recombinant cells or transgenic non-human animals preferably exhibit<br>
an altered TACE/ADAM17 and/or amphiregulin expression compared to a<br>
corresponding wild-type cell or animal.<br>
Examples of suitable receptor tyrosine kinases are EGFR and other<br>
members of the EGFR family such as HER2, HER3 or HER4, PDGFR, the<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR/Flk-1, the Trk receptor,<br>
FGFR-1 or IGF-1 receptor but also other types of growth-factor receptors<br>
such as TNF receptor 1, TNF receptor 2, CD30 and IL-6 receptor are targets<br>
for the G protein/GPCR mediated signal transduction.<br>

Requires Proamphiregulin Cleavage by TACE<br>
1.      Methods<br>
1.1     Cell culture, plasmids and retroviral infections<br>
All cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were<br>
routinely grown according to the supplier's instructions. Transfections of<br>
HEK-293 cells were carried out by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as<br>
previously described (1). Anti-amphiregulin (AR), anti-HB-EGF neutralizing<br>
antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), PTX, heparin (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO), marimastat (BB2516, Sugen Inc., South San Francisco, CA),<br>
batimastat (BB94, British Biotech, Oxford, UK) were added to serum-starved<br>
cells before the respective growth factor.<br>
Full-length cDNAs encoding ADAM10, 12, 15 and 17 were amplified by PCR<br>
from a human placenta cDNA library and subcloned into pcDNA3<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pLXSN vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For<br>
virus production dominant negative protease constructs lacking the pro- and<br>
metalloprotease domains were generated as described before (2,26). All<br>
protease constructs included a C-termina! hemagglutinin (HA) tag,<br>
detectable with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA).<br>
The amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix was transfected with pLXSN<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-14-<br>
retroviral expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate/chloroquine method<br>
as described previously(29). At 24 h after transfectipn, the viral supernatant<br>
was collected and used to infect subconfluent SCC-9 cells (5 x 104 cells/ 6-<br>
Well plate).<br>
1.2	Protein analysis<br>
Cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated as described (13).<br>
Western blots were performed according to standard methods. The<br>
antibodies against human EGFR (108.1) and SHC (1), as well as a GST-<br>
Grb2 fusion protein (5), have been characterized before. Phosphotyrosine<br>
was detected with the 4G10 monoclonal antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY).<br>
Polydonal anti-phospho-p44/p42 (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK antibody and anti-<br>
phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs<br>
(Beverly, MA). Polydonal anti-Akt1/2 and anti-ERK2 antibody was from<br>
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TACE antibodies from<br>
Chemicon (Harrow, UK).<br>
1.3	Flow cytometric analysis and EUSA<br>
ACS analysis was performed as described before (1). Cells were stained<br>
with ectodomain-specific antibodies against HB-EGF, AR (R&amp;D Systems) or<br>
TGFa (Oncogene, Boston; MA). After washing with PBS, cells were<br>
incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and analyzed on a<br>
Becton Dickinson FACScalibur flow cytometer.<br>
Concentrations of free AR were determined by sandwich ELISA (R&amp;D<br>
Systems) using monoclonal anti-AR capture antibody and biotinyiated<br>
polyclonal detection antibody. Standards were recombinant human AR<br>
diluted in culture medium. For statistical analysis Student's t-test was used<br>
to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as mean ± s. d.<br>

Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and 4.2 ug siRNA duplex per 6-well plate as<br>
previously described (30). Transfected SCC-9 cells were serum-starved and<br>
assayed 4 d after transfection. Highest efficiencies in silencing target genes<br>
were obtained by using mixtures of siRNA duplexes targeting different<br>

Specific silencing of targeted genes was confirmed by Western blot (TACE)<br>
and RT-PCR analysis. RNA isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,<br>
Germany) was  reverse  transcribed  using  AMV Reverse  Transcriptase<br>
(Roche,   Mannheim,   Germany).   PuReTaq   Ready-To-Go   PCR   Beads<br>

ethidium bromide staining. Location of the products and their sizes were<br>
determined by using a 100-bp ladder (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, Maryland)<br>
under ultraviolet illumination.<br>
1.5    Proliferation and migration assays<br>
For the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay (5), SCC-15 cells were seeded into<br>
12-well plates at 3 x 104 cells/well. Upon serum deprivation for 48 h, cells<br>
were subjected to pre-incubation and stimulation as indicated. After 18 h<br>
cells were pulse-labelled with 3H-thymidine (1 uCi/ml) for 4 h, and thymidine<br>
incorporation was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and<br>
subsequent liquid-scintillation counting.<br>
Analysis of cell motility was performed as described before (13) using a<br>
modified Boyden chamber. 24 h after transfection with siRNAs SCC-9 cells<br>
were seeded into polycarbonate membrane inserts (6.5 mm diameter and 8<br>
um pore size) in 24-transwell dishes at 1 x 10s cells/ well in the presence or<br>
absence of agonist. The lower chamber was filled with standard medium<br>
without FCS containing 10 ug/ml fibronectin as chemoattractant. Cells were<br>
permitted to migrate for 36 h. Following incubation, nonmigrated cells were<br>
removed from the upper surface of the membranes. The cells that had<br>
migrated to the lower surface were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The<br>
stained cells were solubilized in 10 % acetic acid, absorbance at 570 nm<br>
was measured in a micro-plate reader.<br>
2.       Results<br>
The GPCR-induced transactivation signal in HNSCC cells is sensitive to<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-17-<br>
broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitors such as batimastat (BB94) (13)<br>
and marimastat (BB2516; Fig. 1A). Consistent with a ligand-dependent<br>
mechanism of EGFR signal transactivation we found that the monoclonal<br>
anti-EGFR antibody 1CR-3R which prevents binding of EGF-like growth<br>
factors to the extracellular domain of the receptor (14) abrogated GPCR-<br>
and EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in SCC-9 cells (Fig. 1A).<br>
In contrast, ICR-3R did not . interfere with responses triggered by<br>
pervanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (15) which increases<br>
the tyrosine phosphorylation content of many intracellular proteins. Previous<br>
reports demonstrating that GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation<br>
requires proteolytic cleavage of HB-EGF (1-3) prompted us to ask whether<br>
HB-EGF or other EGF-like growth factors are involved in the EGFR<br>
transactivation pathway in head and neck cancer cells. By cDNA microarray<br>
analysis we found the expression of HB-EGF, TGFoc and AR mRNAs in<br>
SCC-4, SCC-9, SCC-15 and SCC-25 cells (data not shown). Moreover,<br>
expression and cell surface localization of these ligands were confirmed by<br>
flow cytometry using ectodomain specific antibodies (Fig. 1B, representative<br>
data shown for SCC-9). Surprisingly, treatment of head and neck cancer<br>
cells with LPA (10 uM) or the Dhorbol ester TPA (1 mM). which acts as a<br>
general inductor of shedding events, reduced the cell surface content of<br>
endogenous proAR (Fig. 1C). However, in this cellular context, LPA was not<br>
able to induce the proteolytic cleavage of proTGFoc or proHB-EGF, while<br>
stimulation with TPA resulted in ectodomain cleavage of both EGF-like<br>
growth factor precursors (data not shown). These findings suggested that<br>
LPA stimulation selectively induces shedding of proAR in HNSCC. In<br>
addition, batimastat (10 uM) completely abolished LPA-induced ectodomain<br>
cleavage of proAR (Fig. 1C) confirming the requirement of metalloprotease<br>
activity for proAR shedding. In agreement with the observation that<br>
predominantly pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins of the Gi/o family<br>
are mediators of LPA-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A),<br>
PTX (100 ng/mL) partially inhibited proAR shedding at the cell surface of<br>
SCC-9 cells (Fig. 1C).<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-18-<br>
In addition to the decrease of cell-surface proAR, GPCR stimulation resulted<br>
in the accumulation of mature AR in cell culture medium as determined by<br>
sandwich-ELISA (Fig. 1D). The finding that AR release in response to<br>
carbachol was substantially lower compared to LPA stimulation suggested a<br>
direct correlation between the amount of released AR and EGFR tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation content in response to GPCR ligands (Fig. 1A). Moreover,<br>
pre-incubation with batimastat completely prevented GPCR- and TPA-<br>
induced accumulation of AR in cell culture medium (Fig. 1D), confirming<br>
metalloprotease-dependency of AR release.<br>
We used three approaches to determine if AR function is required for<br>
GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream cellular<br>
responses. First, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the<br>
endogenous expression of proAR, proHB-EGF and proTGFcc in SCC-9 cells.<br>
Efficient and specific knockdown of target gene expression was monitored<br>
by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) confirming that gene silencing occurred by mRNA<br>
degradation. Concomitantly, the effect of siRNAs on the EGFR<br>
transactivation signal was examined. As shown in Figure 2B, siRNA to<br>
proAR completely blocked GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation.<br>
SiRNAs to proHB-EGF and proTGFa, however, did not significantly alter the<br>
transactivation signal demonstrating specific requirement for proAR. In<br>
addition, we examined whether proAR knockdown affects the GPCR-induced<br>
motility of head and neck cancer cells. In fact, proAR siRNA significantly<br>
suppressed LPA-induced chemotactic migration in vitro (Fig. 2C).<br>
Second, we examined the effect of AR neutralizing antibodies on EGFR<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation by LPA in the squamous cell carcinoma ceil lines<br>
SCC-4, SCC-9, SCC-15 and SCC-25. The results show that pre-treatment<br>
with either a polyclonal goat or a monoclonal mouse antibody raised against<br>
the ectodomain of human AR inhibited the EGFR transactivation signal (Fig.<br>
2D, representative data shown for the polyclonal anti-AR antibody in SCC-9<br>
cells). Similar results were obtained upon stimulation of head and neck<br>
cancer cells with carbachol (data not shown). In contrast, specific inhibition<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-19-<br>
of HB-EGF by using the diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197 or anti-HB-EGF<br>
neutralizing antibodies showed no effect on LPA- or carbachol-induced<br>
EGFR transactivation (data not shown).<br>
Third,    since    AR    contains    a    heparin-binding    domain    and    the<br>
glycosaminoglycan heparin prevents AR-triggered mitogenic responses in<br>
keratinocytes (16) and MCF-10A cells (17) we evaluated the effect of<br>
heparin on the EGFR transactivation signal. As expected, heparin (100<br>
ng/mL) completely blocked EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation caused by LPA<br>
(Fig. 2D). Based on these findings we next examined whether AR function is<br>
required for SHC activation downstream of the transactivated EGFR, since<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC and formation of a<br>
SHC-Grb2-Sos complex is known to be a critical step in linking the activated<br>
EGFR to the Ras/MAPK cascade (18). In fact, AR blockade completely<br>
prevented   LPA-induced   SHC  tyrosine   phosphorylation   (Fig.   2D)   and<br>
association with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) Grb2 fusion protein (Fig.<br>
2E).<br>
Several studies have previously demonstrated that EGFR transactivation is<br>
one important mechanism whereby GPCR agonists activate the ERK/MAPK<br>
pathway (4,12,19,20). To determine whether AR was required for LPA<br>
stimulated ERK/MAPK activation in HNSCC cells, the effect of AR-inhibition<br>
on ERK1/2 activation was studied. As shown on Figure 2F, AR neutralizing<br>
antibodies, heparin and batimastat prevented LPA-induced ERK activation<br>
in SCC-9 and SCC-15 cells. In addition to its mitogenic effect, LPA can act<br>
as a survival factor by activating both the ERK/MAPK pathway and the<br>
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pl3K)-dependent phosphorylation of Akt/PKB<br>
(21,22). We therefore raised the question whether LPA stimulation induces<br>
phosphorylation of Akt/PKB in head and neck cancer cells. The results<br>
indicate that LPA markedly increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at Ser-473<br>
(Fig. 2F). Moreover, Akt/PKB phosphorylation by LPA was sensitive to PI3K<br>
inhibition by wortmannin or LY294002 (data not shown) and was also<br>
abrogated by AR blockade or batimastat treatment (Fig. 2F).<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-20-<br>
To further extend our studies on AR function for growth-promoting GPCR<br>
signalling we assessed the effect of AR inhibition on LPA-induced DNA<br>
synthesis. As shown in Figure 2G, HNSCC cells displayed a significant<br>
reduction in the rate of DNA synthesis triggered by LPA upon AR inhibition<br>
suggesting that a full proliferative response by LPA requires AR. Moreover,<br>
batimastat and the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 decreased<br>
DNA synthesis by LPA to below basal level. Collectively, these data<br>
substantiate the requirement of AR for the generation of an EGFR-<br>
characteristic, mitogenic and motility-promoting transactivation signal in<br>
HNSCC.<br>
Recent observations have suggested a role of the metalloprotease-<br>
disintegrin TACE/ ADAM17 in constitutive shedding of proAR and other<br>
EGF-like growth factor precursors in mouse fibrobiasts (23,24). Moreover,<br>
the proteolytic activity of TACE has been shown to be inhibited by the tissue<br>
inhibitor of metalloprotease-3 (Timp-3) but not Timp-1 in vitro (25). As TACE<br>
is widely expressed in HNSCC cell lines (Fig. 3A) we investigated the effect<br>
of Timp-1 and Timp-3 on the EGFR transactivation signal. Indeed, ectopic<br>
expression of Timp-3 but not Timp-1 by retroviral transduction inhibited<br>
GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphoryiation in SCC-9 cells (Fig. 3B).<br>
Furthermore, ectopic expression of dominant negative TACE which lacks the<br>
pro- and metalloprotease domain (26) (Fig. 3C) suppressed GPCR-induced<br>
proAR cleavage, release of mature AR (Fig. 3D) and EGFR signal<br>
transactivation in SCC-9 cells (Fig. 3E). In contrast, neither dominant<br>
negative mutants of ADAM10 (3) and ADAM12 (2) which have been shown<br>
to be involved in GPCR-triggered proHB-EGF processing nor an analogous<br>
ADAM15 mutant affected the GPCR-induced responses (Fig. 3E,<br>
representative data shown for ADAM12).<br>
To independently verify the requirement of TACE for the EGFR<br>
transactivation pathway in HNSCC we blocked endogenous expression of<br>
TACE by RNA interference. Suppression of TACE expression was monitored<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-21-<br>
by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, siRNA-<br>
clirected inhibition of TACE resulted in the accumulation of proAR at the cell<br>
surface of SCC-9 cells (Fig. 4B) supporting the view that TACE is involved in<br>
basal proAR ectodomain processing. In addition, TACE siRNA specifically<br>
suppressed GPCR-induced EGFR, SHC, ERK/MAPK and Akt/PKB activation<br>
(Fig. 4C). Finally, TACE siRNA also prevented migration of SCC-9 cells in<br>
response to LPA (Fig. 4D).<br>
3.      Discussion<br>
An increasing amount of experimental evidence supports the concept that<br>
the EGFR functions as a central integrator of diverse GPCR signals which<br>
are thereby funnelled to downstream pathways (4,6,12). The data presented<br>
here support an unexpected mechanism of EGFR transactivation in human<br>
cancer cells and identify a novel biological function for TACE in GPCR<br>
signalling. Our results demonstrate that GPCR-induced activation of TACE<br>
has biological consequences that can be attributed to an increase in the<br>
amount of free AR. Other mechanisms, in which HB-EGF-dependent<br>
transactivation of the EGFR is mediated by ADAM10 in lung epithelial cells<br>
(3) and COS-7 cells (27) or by ADAM12 in cardiomyocytes (2) have been<br>
described. This is the first demonstration, however, that transmembrane<br>
proAR is cleaved in response to GPCR stimulation and also that AR is<br>
functionally relevant for mediating hallmark cancer cell characteristics by<br>
GPCR agonists. We demonstrate that TACE-dependent AR release is a<br>
prerequisite to GPCR-induced EGFR stimulation, activation of the<br>
ERK/MAPK pathway, phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, induction of cell<br>
proliferation and migration.<br>
How TACE is activated by heterotrimeric G proteins is not known. Although<br>
ERK has been shown to bind to and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain<br>
of TACE at threonine 735 in response to TPA stimulation (28), GPCR-<br>
induced AR release and EGFR tyrosine phosphoryiation is insensitive to<br>
MEK inhibitors in HNSCC cells (unpublished observation) suggesting ERK<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-22-<br>
not to be involved upstream of the EGFR. An important issue of future<br>
studies will be to determine how GPCR signal transmission is defined to be<br>
mediated by either ADAM10/HB-EGF, ADAM12/HB-EGF or TACE/AR<br>
modules in a cell-type or physiology-dependent manner. Thus, our<br>
experimental results represent compelling evidence for the relevance of<br>
physiologically important GPCR ligands, TACE and AR in the mediation of<br>
critical cancer cell characteristics.<br>
Example 2 Production and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
against TACE<br>
2.1	Generation of monoclonal antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were raised against the metalloprotease-<br>
domain of human TACE (ADAM17). Recombinant protein was used for<br>
immunization of BALB/c mice (J.H. Peters, H. Baumgarten and M. Schulze,<br>
Monoclonale Antikorper-Herstellung und Charakterisierung, Springer-Verlag,<br>
1985,   Berlin  Heidelberg  New York Tokio),   Purification  of monoclonal<br>
antibodies took place with T-Gel™ Adsorbent from Pierce, Rockford, IL,<br>
USA).<br>
2.2	Functional analysis<br>
8 monoclonal antibodies recognizing the metalloprotease-domain of TACE<br>
were identified by ELISA. These antibodies were used for<br>
immunoprecipitation of lysates of HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with<br>
an eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding TACE tagged with the<br>
hemagglutinin epitope (TACE-HA) (31). The monoclonal antibodies 432-2,<br>
400-1, 343-3 and 432-7 specifically immunoprecipitate the mature form of<br>
TACE, whereas the a-HA antibody immunoprecipitates predominantly the<br>
pro-form of TACE (Figure 5).<br>
Furthermore, the ability of the monoclonal antibodies to immunoprecipitate<br><br>
WO 2004/073734	PCT/KP2004/001691<br>
-23-<br>
endogenous TACE protein from lysates of SCC-9 cells was tested. The<br>
MAbs 432-2, 400-1, 343-3 and 432-7 raised against the metalloprotease<br>
domain of TACE specifically immunoprecipitate the mature form of TACE<br>
and not the pro-form (Fig. 6).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies were tested for their ability to detect TACE on the ceil<br>
surface of living cells. Antibodies 402-6 and 368-3 showed no cell surface<br>
staining, whereas 367-3 showed a weak signal. In contrast, antibodies 343-<br>
3, 374-5, 400-1,432-2 and 432-7 showed a strong signal (Fig. 7).<br>
Finally, we examined the effect of monoclonal TACE antibodies on LPA-<br>
Induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the squamous cell carcinoma cell<br>
line SCC-9. The results show that pre-treatment with 374-5, 432-2, 400-1<br>
and 367-3 inhibited the EGFR signal transactivation induced by LPA (Figure<br>
8), whereas direct stimulation of the EGFR with EGF was not affected by<br>
pre-treatment with monoclonal TACE antibodies (Figure 9).<br><br>
