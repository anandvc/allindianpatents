FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of printing. Further, this invention relates to sorting of print jobs based on the Page Description Language (PDL) prior to printing in order to print the jobs quickly if the printer supports multiple PDL. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of grouping the print jobs according to the PDL after pre scanning.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Presently whenever the print jobs of different PDLs are sent to the printer, the printer loads with each job PDL after reading the job header. In this manner, there is a time lag between any two print jobs of different PDL and the user has to wait for some time until the printer is loaded with each PDL and hence the throughput is decreased. Generally the printers are supported with more than three or four PDLs and some times high end printers support even more PDLs.<br>
United States Patent 6,621,589 describes a Print job processing in a printer network using selected printer attributes.<br>
A central print system in which print jobs are directed to a particular print resource based on a set of print job attributes specified by an end user at the time the print job is submitted. The central print system provides intent-based printing which allows the end user to specify the end result of the printing operation rather than initially selecting a print resource. A print job manager processes the print job using the end user selected print job processing attributes to select the appropriate print resource from a group of networked print resources. An attribute registers a set of job processing attributes for each print resource servicing a single print queue and provides a list of available print job attributes to each client computer on the network from which an end user specifies particular job attributes to define a desired end result for a print job. The attribute manager periodically updates the job processing attribute list as print resources are added to or deleted<br><br>
from the network. The central print system may include one or more add-on modules accessible by the print job manager which provide additional functionality to the print system not available in or required to be provided by a print resource.<br>
United States Patent 6,583,890 describes a method and apparatus for improving page description language (PDL) efficiency by recognition and removal of redundant constructs. A method and system for removing redundant or repeated information from a multiple-page document file is described. A master prolog is created for storing information which is repeated in two or more pages within the document file. Repeated information that is stored in both the master prolog and one or more pages within the document file are identified. The repeated information is then removed from one or more of the pages within the document file. The master prolog is implemented within one or more of the pages to provide a more efficient representation of the repeated information.<br>
United States Patent: 5,113,355 describe a Printer control system. A printer control system which enables queue identifiers, which identify different print jobs, to be sorted such that those queue identifiers identifying print jobs which require fonts that are already loaded in the print server are placed at the head of a print list, and those queue identifiers identifying print jobs which require fonts that are not loaded in the print server are placed at the end of the print list. The print jobs are then processed in the order that the queue identifiers appear on the print list. When a print job to be processed requires fonts that are not loaded into the system a message is displayed on a display unit in order to inform the operator which fonts need to be loaded into the system.<br>
Abbreviated as PDL, Page Description Language is a language for describing the layout and contents of a printed page.<br>
The best-known PDLs are Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard PCL (Printer Control Language), both of which are used to control laser printers as well as Inkjet printers.<br><br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Generally the printers are designed to support more than three or four PDLs and whenever print jobs of different PDLs are sent to the printer, the printer loads with each PDL after reading the job header. In this manner of printing, there is a time lag between the two print jobs and the user has to wait for some time till the printer is loaded with the job PDL and hence the throughput is decreased.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to invent a method of grouping the print jobs according to the PDLs after pre scanning.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to increase the throughput and put lesser load on the printer.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to invent a method which eliminates or substantially decreases the time gap between any two print jobs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
PDL is a printer descriptive language. There are several PDL such as PS, PCL3, PCL5, SPL etc. supported by the printers. There are many PDL evolved because some of them are proprietary and some are used to print specific application data.<br>
Network printers are shared by many users in an organization and each user may fire print jobs with different personality or PDL on the same printer hardware.<br>
The printer hardware has to load the particular PDL interpreter according to the job. Hence the printer takes some time between two jobs before printing if it is of different personality or PDL. Generally the PDL or personality are loaded in memory in compressed form and are loaded on the working memory area according to the job personality.<br><br>
This invention could have two scenarios wherein in the first scenario, the printer would be connected to the print server and the print server would be responsible for grouping the jobs according to the PDLs after pre scanning the job header and in the second scenario where the printer is directly connected to the network the printer itself will group the job accordingly after reading the job header.<br>
Accordingly, this invention comprises a method of grouping print jobs according to the PDUs after pre scanning job header associated with the print job in a printer comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	generating   number   of   print  jobs   from   a   plurality   of<br>
workstations;<br>
b.	executing the said print jobs in a predetermined order;<br>
c.	building a print queue by a print job controller; and<br>
d.	performing a specific print processing .<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagram when the printer is connected through print server.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagram when the printer is directly connected to the user<br>
without using print server.<br>
Figure 3 shows a Print Queue Table.<br>
Figure 4 shows a Printer Control System.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with<br><br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Before describing the various aspects and details of the present invention it will be useful to describe the context in which the invention is used. Consequently, a preliminary discussion that refers to Figures 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 is hereby provided.<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagram when the printer is connected through print server. When the printer is connected through print server the print server will take care of grouping the jobs according to the PDL. The figure shows multiple users using a printer connected in a printer server.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagram when the printer is directly connected to the user without using print server. When the printer is directly connected to the user without using print server the printer firmware will take care of grouping the jobs of similar PDL's. Figure shows multiple users connected to a printer directly connected to the network.<br>
Figure 3 shows a Print Queue Table. The print queue to be managed by the print<br>
job manager consists of the associated queue identifiers q1, q2, . . . qn. The print jobs are successively outputted for printout by the printing processor, with the print job content at the head of the queue having identifier q1 being outputted first. The print jobs are executed according to the order of queue identifiers in the print queue table by the printing processor.<br>
Figure 4 shows a Printer Control System. Here the print jobs will be arranged according to the PDL after reading the job header.<br><br>
PDL inspector would help in executing the algorithm adapted by the printer control system. PDL inspector consists of PDL loader which would load the PDL according to the PDL requested in job header. This unit would be in sync with the PDL comparator which would help in comparing the current job PDL and PDL loaded on the printer. PDL checker would check the PDL requested by the job which would be compared with the PDL presently loaded on the printer/MFP. This idea targets to group print jobs of similar personalities so that there is minimal time lag between any two print jobs and the printer does not have to change the personalities for each job.<br>
The printer control system is provided with a capability of automatically changing the order of print jobs in the print queue in accordance with the sort option designated by the operator. When this system receives a new print job, the queue identifier of that print job will be inserted into the print queue at an optimum position in accordance with the sort option designated by the operator. The system is so designed that in the absence of a designated sort option, the operator is free to rearrange queue identifiers in the print queue by changing their positions. If a particular sort option is designated by the operator, the system will disregard the position of the queue identifier for the operator-designated job in the print queue and rearrange queue identifiers in the order that complies with the designated particular sort option.<br>
The following four sort options (1)-(4) may be designated:<br>
(1)	the print requests are sorted according to the time they are entered (First-in First-out, or FIFO);<br>
(2)	the queue identifier for the print job that requires binding is inserted at the top of the print queue (Binder First);<br>
(3)	print requests are sorted according to the requested time of printing (Short Job First); and<br><br>
(4) the media (printing media) required in a particular print job are compared with the media loaded in the printer and the queue identifier of a print job which is such that all the media it requires are loaded (e.g., a print job that uses a plurality of media to print graphs on OHP sheets and sentences on sheets of plain paper to create a report containing the graphs) is inserted at the top of the print queue (Stack Match).<br>
The print queue to be managed by the print job manager consists of the associated queue identifiers q1, q2,. .. qn that are arranged in the order set by a particular sort option or by other methods as described above and the print jobs are successively outputted for printout by the printing processor, with the print job content at the head of the queue having identifier q1 being outputted first. The printing processor executes print jobs according to the order of queue identifiers in the print queue table.<br>
Each of the print job contents is maintained either in a file storage means (not shown) in the printer or in a file storage means (file server) linked to the network and is outputted to the printing processor at the time of printout, namely the time when the associated queue identifier has come to the head of the print queue table.<br>
The network printer could be on print server or directly on network and being shared between different users.<br>
Scenario 1<br>
When the printer is connected through print server<br>
In this case the print server will take care of grouping the jobs according to the PDL<br>
Scenario 2<br>
When the printer is directly connected to the user without using print server<br><br>
In this case the printer firmware will take care of grouping the jobs of similar PDLs.<br>
In both the scenarios, priority of the print jobs should not be the critical factor which are generally not so in big organizations.<br>
The print server or the printer hardware will take particular set of print jobs in a queue and will apply this grouping of jobs algorithm.<br>
While many workstations generating print jobs are usually linked to the network, a smaller number of printers are used and, in a typical case, a single printer is used with several workstations. Thus, in order that a number of print jobs generated from a plurality of workstations are executed in a predetermined order, the print job controller builds a print queue, according to which a specific print processing will be performed.<br>
This feature can be operated by a dedicated key button on the panel with heading optimize the printing speed or it could be done through the driver Ul which will update the configuration file which will be read by the print server to apply the algorithm.<br>
