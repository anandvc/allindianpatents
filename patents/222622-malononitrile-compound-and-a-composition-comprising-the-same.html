The pesticide composition of the present invention contains the present invention compound and an inert carrier. Generally, it is a formulation obtained by mixing the present invention compound and a carrier such as a solid carrier, a liquid carrier and a gaseous carrier, and if necessary, adding a surfactant and other adjuvant for formulation. The formulation includes, for example, an emulsifiable concentrate, an oil solution, a shampoo formulation, a f lowable , a dust, a wettable powder, a granule, a paste formulation, a microcapsule, a foam, an aerosol, a carbon dioxide gas formulation, a tablet, a resin preparation and the like. These formulations can be converted to use into a poison bait, a mosqito coil, an electric mosquito mat, a smoking agent, a fumigant or sheet.<br>
In the pesticide composition of the present invention, the present invention compound is usually contained in an amount of 0.1% to 95% by weight.<br>
The solid carrier for formulation includes, for example, a fine power and a granule of clays (e.g., kaolin clay, diatomite, bentonite, Fubasami clay, acid clay, etc.), synthetic hydrated silicon oxide, talc, ceramic, other inorganic minerals (e.g., sericite, quartz, sulfur, activated carbon, calcium carbonate, hydrated silica) or chemical fertilizers (e.g. , ammonium sulfate.<br><br>
ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, urea) .<br>
The liquid carrier for formulation includes, for example, aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., xylene, toluene, alkylnaphthalene, phenylxylylethane, kerosine, light oil, hexane, cyclohexane), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane), alcohols (e.g. , methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, hexanol, ethylene glycol), ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane), esters (e.g., ethyl acetate, butyl acetate), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone), nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, isobutyronitrile), sulfoxides (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide), acid amides (e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide), vegetable oils (e.g., soy bean oil, cotton seed oil), vegetable essential oils (e.g., orange oil, hyssop oil, lemon oil) and water.<br>
The gaseous carrier for formulation includes, for example, butane gas, chlorof luorocarbons, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) , dimethyl ether, carbon dioxide and the like.<br>
The surfactant for formulation includes, for example, alkyl sulfate salts, alkylsulfonic acid salts, alkylarylsulfonic acid salts, alkyl aryl ethers and their polyoxyethylene derivatives,  polyethylene glycol ethers,<br><br>
polyhydric alcohol esters, and sugar alcohol derivatives.<br>
The other adjuvant for formulation includes, for example, binders, dispersants and stabilizers, and specifically for example, casein, gelatin, polysaccharides (e.g., starch, gum arable, cellulose derivatives, alginic acid), lignin derivatives, bentonite, sugars, synthetic water-soluble polymers (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid), PAP (isopropyl acid phosphate), BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol), BHA (a mixture of 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol and 3-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol), vegetable oils, mineral oils, fatty acids, and fatty acid esters.<br>
The base for resin formulation includes, for example, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane and the like. To these bases, if necessary, a plasticizer such as phthalate (e.g., dimethyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate), adipate and stearate maybe added. The resin formulation can be obtained by kneading the compound into the base using a known kneader and then formulating by injectionmolding, extrusion molding, press molding and the like, and further, if necessary, via a process for molding, cutting and the like, the resin formulation can be converted into a resin preparation such as board, film, tape, net, string and the like.

A base for the poison bait includes, for example, grain<br><br>
powders, vegetable oils, sugars, and crystalline cellulose, and further, if necessary, antioxidants such as dibutylhydroxytoluene and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, preservatives such as dehydroacetic acid, agents for preventing children and pets from erroneously eating such as hot pepper powder, and pest-attractive flavors such as cheese flavor, onion flavor and peanut oil may be added to the base.<br>
Pests can be controlled by applying an effective amount of the present invention compound to pests directly and/or habitats of pests (e.g., plant, animal, soil). Usually the formulation of the pesticide composition of the present invention is used as the present invention compound.<br>
When the pesticide composition of the present invention is used for a control of pests in agriculture and forestry, the application amount is usually 1 to 10,000 g/ha, preferably 10 to 1,000 g/ha, as an active ingredient. The emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, flowables, and microcapsule formulations are usually applied after dilution with water to have an active ingredient concentration of 1 to 10, 000 ppm, while dusts and granules are usually applied as such. These formulations may be sprayed directly to the plant to be protected from pests. The pests living in a soil can be controlled by treating the soil with these formulations, and the formulations can also be applied to treat seedbeds prior to the planting plants or to treat planting holes or plant bottoms in the planting.<br><br>
Furthermore, the sheet formulation of the pesticide composition of the present invention can be applied by a method such as winding around plants, stretching in the vicinity of plants and laying on the soil surface at the plant bottom.<br>
When the pesticide composition of the present invention is used for a control of epidemic, the application amount is usually 0.001 to 10 mg/m3 as an active ingredient in case of application for open space, and 0.001 to 100 mg/m2 as an active ingredient in case of application for plane surface. The emulsifiable conscentrate, wettable powders, flowables, and microcapsule formulations are usually applied after dilution with water to have an active ingredient concentration of 0.01 to 10,000 ppm, while oil solutions, aerosols, smoking agents and poison baits are usually applied as such.<br>
When the pesticide composition of the present invention is used for a control of parasite living outside of a livestock such as caw, horse, pig, sheep, goat and chicken, and a small animal such as dog, cat, rat and mouse, the pesticide composition can be applied to said animal by a veterinarily known method. Specifically, for systemic control, the pesticide composition is administered by means of, for example, a tablet, a mixture with feed, a suppository or an injection (e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal), and for non-systemic control, it is applied by a method such as spraying an oil solution or an aqueous liquid formulation, carrying out<br><br>
pour-on treatment or spot-on treatment, washing said animal with a shcimpoo formulation, attaching the resin formulation on said animal as a collar or an ear-tag, and the like. When the present invention compound is administered to an animal, its amount is usually in the range of 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg body weight of the animal.<br>
