ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEM ON A PLASTIC<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
electrochemical devices comprising at least one active<br>
species, in particular to the field of electrochromic<br>
devices. These electrochemical devices are used<br>
especially for manufacturing glazing whose light and/or<br>
energy transmission or light and/or energy reflection<br>
can be modulated by means of an electric current.<br>
Taking the particular example of electrochromic<br>
systems, it will be recalled that these comprise, in a<br>
known manner, at least one anodic-coloration or<br>
cathodic-coloration species having two coloration<br>
states corresponding to two oxidation states, one of<br>
the states generally being transparent.<br>
Many electrochromic systems are constructed on the<br>
following "five-layer" model: TC1 / EC1 / EL / EC2 /<br>
TC2, in which TC1 and TC2 are electronically conductive<br>
materials, EC1 and EC2 are electrochromic materials<br>
capable of reversibly and simultaneously inserting<br>
cations and electrons, and EL is an electrolyte<br>
material that is both an electronic insulator and an<br>
ionic conductor. The electronic conductors are<br>
connected to an external power supply and by applying a<br>
suitable potential difference between the two<br>
electronic conductors the color of the system can be<br>
changed. Under the effect of the potential difference,<br>
depending on the system considered, the oxidation<br>
states are reversed or else the ions are extracted from<br>
one electrochromic material and inserted into the other<br>
electrochromic material, passing through the<br>
electrolyte material. The electronic conductors and the<br>
external power circuit which allow the transport of<br>
electrons ensure electrical neutrality of the entire<br>
system. The electrochromic system is generally<br>
deposited on a support, which may or may not be<br>
transparent, and organic or mineral in nature, which is<br>
then called a substrate. In certain cases, two<br><br>
substrates may be used - either each possesses part of<br>
the electrochromic system and the complete system is<br>
obtained by joining the two substrates together, or one<br>
substrate has the entire electrochromic system and the<br>
other one is designed to protect the system.<br>
When the electrochromic system is intended to work in<br>
transmission, the electroconductive materials are<br>
generally transparent oxides, the electronic conduction<br>
of which has been increased by doping, such as the<br>
materials In2O3:Sn, In2O3:Sb, Zn0:Al or SnO2:F. Tin-doped<br>
indium oxide (In2O3: Sn or ITO) is frequently chosen for<br>
its high electronic conductivity properties and its low<br>
light absorption. When the system is intended to work<br>
in reflection, one of the electroconductive materials<br>
may be of metallic type.<br>
One of the electrochromic materials most used and most<br>
studied is tungsten oxide, which switches from a blue<br>
color to transparent depending on its charge insertion<br>
state. This is a cathodic coloration electrochromic<br>
material, that is to say its colored state corresponds<br>
to the inserted (or reduced) state and its bleached<br>
state corresponds to the extracted (or oxidized) state.<br>
During construction of a five-layer electrochromic<br>
system it is common practice to combine it with an<br>
anodic coloration electrochromic material, such as<br>
nickel oxide or iridium oxide, the coloration mechanism<br>
of which is complementary. This results in an<br>
enhancement in the light contrast of the system. It has<br>
also been proposed to use a material that is optically<br>
neutral in the oxidization states in question, such as<br>
for example cerium oxide. All the abovementioned<br>
materials are of inorganic type, but it is also<br>
possible to combine organic materials, such as<br>
viologens (bipyridium salts), 5,10-dihydrophenazines,<br>
1,4-phenylenediamines, benzidines, metallocenes,<br>
Prussian blues or electronically conductive polymers<br>
(polythiophene, polypyrrole, polyaniline etc.) or<br><br>
metallopolymers, with inorganic electrochromic<br>
materials, or even to use only organic electrochromic<br>
materials.<br>
When a multilayer structure based essentially on<br>
organic materials is used, the five-layer structure may<br>
be simplified to a three-layer structure, namely<br>
TC1/AC/TC2, within which the active "layer" AC is in<br>
the form of a polymer matrix, a gel or a liquid. The<br>
layer AC then comprises, in one of the same medium, all<br>
the necessary electroactive materials, namely in<br>
particular the anodic-coloration and cathodic-<br>
coloration species and optionally ionic salts having an<br>
electrolyte function, which are dissolved in a solvent<br>
of the propylene carbonate type. Furthermore, the layer<br>
AC may also contain one or more polymers and additives.<br>
The interpenetrating network polymer systems described<br>
in application FR 2 857 759 are also constructed on<br>
this three-layer model. Moreover, simple systems<br>
conventionally called "viologen" systems, in which<br>
cathodic-coloration species, of the type comprising<br>
bipyridinium salts (namely viologen materials) and<br>
anodic-coloration species (for example phenazines) are<br>
dissolved in a liquid or a gel based for example on<br>
propylene carbonate are also three-layer systems.<br>
Irrespective of the envisioned structure, provision is<br>
made for these electrochemical systems to be deposited<br>
on a substrate having an organic glass function,<br>
conventionally based on PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) ,<br>
PC (polycarbonate) PET (polyethylene terephthalate),<br>
PEN (polyethylene naphthoate) or COC (cycloolefin<br>
copolymer).<br>
Now, the deposition of the abovementioned<br>
electrochemical structures on a substrate of<br>
essentially organic nature poses a number of problems<br>
which the present invention is intended to remedy.<br><br>
Thus, the inventors have firstly noticed that<br>
constituents of the composition of the abovementioned<br>
layer AC, which have been deposited directly on a<br>
surface portion of the substrate of organic nature,<br>
could prematurely age the latter following chemical<br>
etching. Moreover, the organic substrate does not<br>
always allow the functionality of the layer AC.<br>
Furthermore, the interaction with the substrate may<br>
degrade the functionality of the layer AC.<br>
The inventors have also made the following observation:<br>
The layer TC1 or TC2, of essentially mineral nature,<br>
which is necessary for the operation of the<br>
electrochemical system to be all-solid or all-polymer<br>
(it allows passage of the current needed to switch from<br>
a colored state to a bleached state, or vice versa),<br>
poses problems at the interface with the organic<br>
substrate. This is because TC1 or TC2, generally based<br>
on ITO albeit thick in order to obtain the required<br>
resistivity (less than 5 ohms per square), requires<br>
deposition at high temperature (several hundred degrees<br>
Celsius) in order to improve its crystalinity. This is<br>
possible when the substrate having a glass function is<br>
inorganic (made of glass) but is very difficult to<br>
envision when the substrate is organic.<br>
The object of the present invention is to alleviate the<br>
drawbacks by proposing a modification to the substrate<br>
of organic nature in order to make it compatible with<br>
an electrochemical multilayer stack structure.<br>
For this purpose, the subject of the invention is an<br>
electrochemical system comprising at least one<br>
substrate of organic nature, at least one<br>
electronically conductive layer and at least one active<br>
species, characterized in that it includes at least one<br>
organic layer lying between the electronically<br>
conductive layer and the substrate, a barrier layer,<br><br>
based on silicon nitride, oxide or oxynitride, or	based<br>
on aluminum nitride or oxide or oxynitride or	on a<br>
mixture of at least two of these compounds (mixed	Si/Al<br>
nitrides or oxynitrides) said barrier layer	being<br>
interposed between the varnish layer and	the<br>
electronically conductive layer.<br>
By using a layer at the interface between the substrate<br>
and the electronically conductive layer, it is possible<br>
on the one hand, to improve the adhesion between the<br>
substrate and the electronically conductive layer (by<br>
compensating for the differences in stresses and in<br>
expansion between the substrate and the electronically<br>
conductive layer) and, on the other hand, to limit<br>
chemical attack of the substrate by the components of<br>
the AC system.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the invention, one or<br>

or quinone or polythiophene;<br>

(Nb) oxide, tin (Sn) oxide, bismuth (Bi) oxide,<br>
vanadium (V) oxide, nickel (Ni) oxide, iridium (Ir)<br>
oxide, antimony (Sb) oxide or tantalum (Ta) oxide, by<br>
itself or as a mixture, and optionally including an<br>
additional metal such as titanium, tantalum or rhenium;<br>
and<br>
the system further includes a layer having an<br>
electrolytic function, chosen from silicon nitride<br><br>
(Si3N4) , molybdenum oxide (MoO3) , tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) ,<br>

aluminum, tin zinc oxide (SnZnOx), vanadium oxide<br>
(V2O5) , at least one of these oxides being optionally<br>

Within the context of the invention, a simplified<br>
configuration of the transparent substrate / TC1 /<br>
layer AC / TC2 / transparent substrate type (three-<br>
layer system) in which the material of the layer AC is<br>
partitioned between two organic substrates may be used.<br>
Moreover, in an "all-solid" (five-layer system)<br>
configuration, the manufacture is simplified since it<br>
is possible to deposit all of the layers of the system,<br>
one after another, on a single carrier substrate.<br>
Furthermore, the device is lightened since it is no<br>
longer essential to have two carrier substrates. The<br>
invention also relates to applications of the<br>
electrochemical device relating to electrochromic<br>
glazing. In this case, it is advantageous to provide<br>
for the substrate or substrates of the device to be<br>
transparent, made of plastic, when the glazing is<br>
intended to operate in variable light transmission.<br>
When the glazing is intended to operate in variable<br>
light transmission, with a device provided with one or<br>
two transparent substrates, it can be mounted as<br>
multiple glazing, especially double glazing, with<br>
another transparent substrate and/or laminated glazing.<br>
Returning to the electrochromic glazing application,<br>
the glazing may advantageously be employed as<br>
architectural glazing, automotive glazing, glazing for<br>
industrial/public transport vehicles, glazing for land<br>
transport vehicles, for aircraft (particularly as<br><br>
windows), river-going or sea-going craft, rear-view or<br>
other mirrors, or as optical elements, such as camera<br>
objectives, or else as the front face or element to be<br>
placed on or near the front face of display screens for<br>
computers or televisions.<br>
The organic substrates are made of light or dark<br>
plastic, of flat or curved shape, and are extremely<br>
lightweight compared with inorganic glass substrates.<br>
Their thickness may vary between 0.6 mm and 19 mm,<br>
depending on the expectations and requirements of the<br>
end users. The substrates may be partially coated with<br>
an opaque material, in particular around the periphery,<br>
especially for aesthetic reasons. The substrate may<br>
also have a specific functionality (arising from a<br>
stack of at least one layer of the solar-control,<br>
antireflection, low-E, hydrophobic, hydrophilic or<br>
other type), and in this case the electrochromic<br>
glazing combines the functions provided by each element<br>
so as to meet the requirements of the users.<br>
A polymer interlayer is used here for the purpose of<br>
joining together the two substrates using the<br>
lamination procedure commonly used in the automobile or<br>
building world so as to end up with a safety or comfort<br>
product: anti-ejection or bulletproof safety for use in<br>
the transport and anti-break-in field (shatterproof<br>
glass) for use in the building field, or providing,<br>
thanks to this lamination interlayer, an acoustic,<br>
solar-protection or coloration functionality. The<br>
lamination operation is also favorable in the sense<br>
that it isolates the functional stack from chemical or<br>
mechanical attack. The interlayer is preferably chosen<br>
based on ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) or its<br>
copolymers. It may also be made of polyurethane (PU) ,<br>
polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a multi-component or single-<br>
component resin that is thermally crosslinkable (epoxy<br>
or PU) or UV-crosslinkable (epoxy or acrylic resin).<br>
The lamination interlayer is generally transparent, but<br><br>
it may be completely or partially colored in order to<br>
meet the wishes of the users.<br>
The isolation of the multilayer stack	from the outside<br>
is generally supplemented by systems	of seals placed<br>
along the edges of the substrates,or even partly<br>
inside the substrates.<br>
The lamination interlayer may also include additional<br>
functions, such as the inclusion of a solar-protection<br>
function provided for example by' a plastic film<br>
comprising ITO/metal/ITO multilayers or a film composed<br>
of a stack of organic layers.<br>
The invention also relates to the process for<br>
manufacturing the device according to the invention, in<br>
which it is possible to deposit the layers of the<br>
functional multilayer stack (TC1/EC1/EL/EC2/TC2) by a<br>
vacuum technique, of the sputtering type, optionally<br>
magnetron or magnetically enhanced sputtering, by<br>
thermal evaporation or electron-beam evaporation, by<br>
laser ablation, by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition),<br>
optionally plasma-enhanced or microwave-enhanced CVD.<br>
The active layer AC may be deposited by an atmospheric<br>
pressure technique especially by the deposition of<br>
layers by sol-gel synthesis, particularly dip coating,<br>
spray coating or laminar flow coating. In the case of<br>
simplified viologen-type systems, it may be<br>
advantageous to use a system for injecting the AC<br>
medium between the two substrates. The layers TC1 and<br>
TC2 are deposited by a technique similar to that for<br>
the five-layer stack structure.<br>
In fact, it is particularly advantageous here to use a<br>
vacuum deposition technique, especially of the<br>
sputtering type, as it allows very fine control of the<br>
characteristics of the layer constituting the<br>
electrolyte (deposition rate, density, structure, etc.)<br><br>

surface image and a roughness curve obtained (along the<br>

which no solvent has been deposited; and<br>
figures 9a and 9b illustrate, respectively, a<br>
surface image and a roughness curve obtained (along the<br>
AA axis) of the PMMA coated with an organic varnish on<br>
which a drop of propylene carbonate has been deposited.<br><br>
In the appended drawings, certain elements have been<br>
shown on a larger or smaller scale than in reality, so<br>
as to make the figures easier to understand.<br>
The example illustrated by figures 1, 2 and 3 relates<br>
to electrochromic glazing 1. It comprises in<br>
succession, from the outside to the inside of the<br>
passenger compartment, two plastic substrates S1, S2,<br>
made of drawn PMMA, or made of PC or COC, for example<br>
2.1 mm and 2.1 mm in thickness respectively.<br>
The substrates S1 and S2 are of the same size and their<br>
dimensions are 150 mm * 150 mm.<br>
The substrate S1 shown in figures 2 and 3 includes, on<br>
face 2, a thin-film multilayer stack of the all-solid<br>
(five-layer) electrochromic type. The substrate S1 is<br>
laminated to the substrate S2 via a thermoplastic sheet<br>
F1 made of polyurethane (PU) of 0.8 mm thickness (it<br>
may be replaced with a sheet of ethylene/vinyl acetate<br>
(EVA) or polyvinyl butyral (PVB)).<br>
It may be seen in the figures that the current<br>
collector layers 2 and/or 4 (TC1 and/or TC2 layers for<br>
example) are not in direct contact with the substrates<br>
S1 and/or S2.<br>
At least one organic layer 10 (visible in figures 2 and<br>
3) is interposed between the substrate and the<br>
electronically conductive layer, improving the adhesion<br>
of the TC1 and/or TC2 layer to the substrate and<br>
preventing the substrate from being chemically attacked<br>
by the layer AC, which is of an organic nature, while<br>
the electronically conductive layer is of essentially<br>
mineral nature.<br>
This organic layer 10 is a varnish based on<br>
polysiloxanes. These polysiloxanes are prepared from<br><br>
commercially available silanes (for example from Sigma-<br>
Aldrich-Fluka) preferably from tetraethoxysilane<br>
(TEOS), methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) or phenyl<br>
trimethoxysilane (PMTS), with a thickness of between<br>
0.5 µm and 10 urn, preferably 1 to 3 µm.<br>
The organic layer 10 may also be covered with an<br>
inorganic layer 11 (shown in figures 2 and 3, 4 and 5),<br>
the layer 11 being for example Si3N4 if a barrier layer<br>
is needed or an SiOx layer formed by PECVD (plasma-<br>
enhanced chemical vapor deposition).<br>
The electrochromic thin-film multilayer comprises an<br>
active multilayer 3 placed between two electronically<br>
conductive materials, also called current collectors 2<br>
and 4. The collector 2 is intended to be in contact<br>
with face 2.<br>
The collectors 2 and 4 and the active multilayer 3 may<br>
be either substantially of the same size and shape, or<br>
substantially of different size and shape, and it will<br>
be understood therefore that the path of the collectors<br>
2 and 4 will be tailored according to the<br>
configuration. Moreover, the dimensions of the<br>
substrates, in particular S1, may be essentially<br>
greater than those of 2, 4 and 3. The collectors 2<br>
and/or 4 may also be in the form of a grid or network<br>
of wires or the like.<br>
The collectors 2 and 4 are of the metallic type or of<br>
the TCO (Transparent Conductive Oxide) type made of<br>
ITO, SnO2:F or ZnO:Al, or they may be a multilayer of<br>
the TCO/metal/TCO type, this metal being selected in<br>
particular from silver, gold, platinum and copper. They<br>
may also be a multilayer of the NiCr/metal/NiCr type,<br>
the metal again being selected in particular from<br>
silver, gold, platinum and copper.<br><br>
Depending on the configuration, they may be omitted,<br>
and in this case current leads are directly in contact<br>
with the active multilayer 3.<br>
The glazing 1 incorporates current leads 8, 9 which<br>
control the active system via a power supply. These<br>
current leads are of the type used for heated windows<br>
(namely shims, wires or the like).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the collector 2 is one formed<br>
by depositing, on face 2, a doped (especially aluminum-<br>
doped or boron-doped) or undoped bilayer consisting of<br>
a SiO2-based first layer about 20 nm in thickness<br>
followed by an ITO second layer of about 100 to 600 nm<br>
in thickness (the two layers preferably being deposited<br>
in succession, in a vacuum, by reactive magnetron<br>
sputtering in the presence of oxygen).<br>
Another embodiment of the collector 2 is one formed by<br>
depositing, on face 2, a monolayer consisting of ITO<br>
about 100 to 600 nm in thickness (a layer preferably<br>
deposited, in a vacuum, by reactive magnetron<br>
sputtering in the presence of oxygen).<br>
The collector 4 is a 100 to 500 nm ITO layer also<br>
deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering on the<br>
active multilayer.<br>
The active multilayer 3 shown in figures 2 and 3 is<br>
made up as follows:<br>
•	a 100 to 300 nm layer of anodic electrochromic<br>
material made of nickel oxide, possibly alloyed with<br>
other metals. As a variant (not shown in the figures),<br>
the layer of anodic material is based on a 40 to 100 nm<br>
layer of iridium oxide;<br>
•	a 100 nm layer of tungsten oxide;<br>
•	a 100 nm layer of hydrated tantalum oxide or<br>
hydrated silica oxide or hydrated zirconium oxide, or a<br>
mixture of these oxides; and<br><br>
• a layer of cathodic electrochromic material based<br>
on hydrated tungsten oxide with a thickness of 200 to<br>
500 nm, preferably 300 to 400 nm, for example about<br>
37 0 nm.<br>
The active multilayer 3 may be incized over all or part<br>
of its periphery with grooves produced by mechanical<br>
means or by laser etching, possibly using a pulsed<br>
laser. This is done so as to limit the peripheral<br>
electrical leakage, as described in French application<br>
FR-2 781 084.<br>
The glazing unit shown in figures 1, 2 and 3 also<br>
incorporates (but not shown in the figures) a first<br>
peripheral seal in contact with faces 2 and 3, this<br>
first seal being designed to form a barrier to external<br>
chemical attack.<br>
A second peripheral seal is in contact with the edge of<br>
SI, the edge of S2 and face 4 so as to form: a barrier,<br>
and a means of mounting with the transport means, to<br>
provide a seal between the inside and the outside, to<br>
form an attractive feature, and to form means for the<br>
incorporation of reinforcing elements.<br>
According to other alternative	embodiments of the<br>
invention, the "all-solid" active	multilayer 3 may be<br>
replaced with other families of polymer type<br>
electrochromic materials.<br>
In the configuration shown in figures 4 and 5, the<br>
electrochromic system (with three or five layers) is<br>
assembled directly between two substrates S1 and S2.<br>
This is a configuration of the following type:<br>
S1/organic layer (10)/inorganic layer (11)/TC1 (2)/<br>
active medium (3)/ TC2(4)/ inorganic layer (11') /<br>
organic layer (10')/ substrate S2.<br><br>
The active medium 3 may consist of 3 polymer layers in<br>
a first variant or a mixed multilayer stack consisting<br>
of inorganic layers and polymers in a second variant,<br>
or else a single medium consisting of viologens and<br>
phenazines dissolved so as to have a typical<br>
concentration of 3 ˟ 10-2M for example in propylene<br>
carbonate, and in which a tetrabutylammonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate salt may be added with a<br>
concentration of 5 ˟ 10"2M in order to form the<br>
electrolyte support.<br>
These embodiments incorporate the same collectors 2 and<br>
4 described above in the case of the all-solid-type<br>
electrochemical systems.<br>
However, they differ by the fact that they do not<br>
require a lamination interlayer f1 for assembling the<br>
organic substrates S1 and S2.<br>
Thus, according to a first example illustrated in<br>
figure 4, a first part formed from a layer of<br>
electrochromic material, or otherwise called the active<br>
layer, made of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) from 10<br>
to 10 000 nm, preferably 50 to 500 nm, in thickness on<br>
a PET substrate coated with an ITO layer - as a<br>
variant, it may be one of the derivatives of this<br>
polymer - is deposited by known liquid deposition<br>
techniques (spray coating, dip coating, spin coating or<br>
flow coating) or else by electrodeposition, on a<br>
substrate coated with its current collector, this<br>
current collector possibly being a lower or upper<br>
conducting layer forming the electrode (anode or<br>
cathode) optionally provided with wires or the like.<br>
Whatever the polymer constituting this active layer,<br>
this polymer is particularly stable, especially under<br>
UV, and operates by insertion/extraction of lithium<br>
ions (Li+) or alternatively of H+ ions.<br><br>
A second part acting as electrolyte, and formed from a<br>
layer with a thickness of between 50 nm and 2000 µm,<br>
and preferably between 50 nm and 1000 µm, is deposited<br>
by a known liquid deposition technique (spray coating,<br>
dip coating, spin coating or flow coating) between the<br>
first and third parts on the first part, or else by<br>
injection. This second part is based on a<br>
polyoxyalkylene, especially polyoxyethylene. As a<br>
variant, it may be a mineral-type electrolyte based for<br>
example on hydrated tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide or<br>
silicon oxide.<br>
This second electrolyte part deposited on the layer of<br>
active electrochromic material, which is itself<br>
supported by the organic substrate, including its<br>
organic varnish layer, is then coated with a third<br>
part, the constitution of which is similar to the first<br>
part, namely this third part is made up of a substrate,<br>
coated with a current collector, this current collector<br>
itself being covered with an active layer.<br>
A second example corresponds to glazing operating by<br>
proton transfer. This consists of:<br>
•	a first organic substrate S1 made of drawn<br>
PMMA, for example 1, 4 mm in thickness; then<br>
•	a varnish layer 10;<br>
•	a first 300 nm TCO-type electronically<br>
conductive layer 2;<br>
•	an 185 nm first layer of anodic<br>
electrochromic material made of nickel oxide NiOxHy (it<br>
could be replaced with a 55 nm layer of hydrated<br>
iridium oxide);<br>
•	an electrolyte made up of a 70 nm first layer<br>
of hydrated tantalum oxide, a 100 micron second layer<br>
of a POE-H3PO4 polyoxyethylene/phosphoric acid solid<br>
solution, or alternatively a PEI-H3PO4<br>
polyethyleneimine/phosphoric acid solid solution;<br>
•	a 350 nm second layer of cathodic<br>
electrochromic material based on tungsten oxide;<br><br>
•	a second 300 nm TCO-type electronically<br>
conducting layer 4;<br>
•	A varnish layer 10; and then<br>
•	A second organic substrate S2, identical to<br>
the first.<br>
In this example, there is therefore a bilayer<br>
electrolyte based on a polymer normally used in this<br>
type of glazing, which is "lined" with a layer of<br>
hydrated tantalum oxide that is sufficiently conducting<br>
not to impair proton transfer via the polymer and that<br>
protects the back electrode made of anodic<br>
electrochromic material from direct contact with the<br>
latter, the intrinsic acidity of which would be<br>
prejudicial thereto.<br>
Instead of the hydrated Ta2O5 layer, a layer of the<br>
hydrated Sb2O5 or TaWOx type may be used.<br>
It is also possible to provide a three-layer<br>
electrolyte, with two hydrated oxide layers, either<br>
with one of them on each side of the polymer layer, or<br>
with the two layers superposed one on the other on the<br>
side facing the layer of anodic electrochromic<br>
material.<br>
According to yet another alternative embodiment, a<br>
barrier layer 11 is intended to be provided between the<br>
organic layer and the electronically conductive layer <br>
TC1 and/or TC2 (to be seen in particular in figure 3<br>
and in figure 4) based on a nitride, oxide, oxynitride<br>
or carbide, chosen from silicon and aluminum or based<br>
on aluminum nitride or oxynitride or carbide or on a<br>
mixture of at least two of these compounds (mixed Si/A1 <br>
nitrides or oxynitrides) ; this barrier layer has a<br>
thickness of 50 nm to 500 nm and preferably from 100 nm<br>
to 300 nm.<br><br>
As a variant, this barrier layer may be composed of<br>
several inorganic layers, chosen from those mentioned<br>
above, or an alternation of organic and inorganic<br>
layers, the organic layer being chosen from<br>
polysiloxanes, polysilanes, polyacrylates,<br>
polyacetates, polyesters, and celluloses.<br>
According to yet another variant, the barrier layer may<br>
be made from tin oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
chromium oxide, copper oxide, germanium oxide, indium<br>
oxide, iridium oxide, antimony oxide, tantalum oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide or a compound of the SiOxCyHz or TiOxCyHz<br>
type.<br>
A third example (illustrated in general by figures 1 to<br>
3, except as regards the organic layer 10, which is<br>
absent) corresponds to a "five-layer" system using an<br>
organic substrate of the PMMA slab type with a<br>
thickness of 4 mm, which has undergone as a sole<br>
treatment an RBS washing before the metal oxide layers<br>
are deposited. It consists of:<br>
a first 4 mm organic substrate S1, for<br>
example made of drawn PMMA;<br>
of an ITO-based TCO layer 2 was deposited<br>
with a thicknes s of 500 nm;<br>
of an EC1/EL/EC2 multilayer (forming the<br>
system 3) judiciously chosen from the abovementioned<br>
oxide layers were deposited;<br>
of an ITO-based TCO layer 4;<br>
of a second 4 mm organic substrate S2, for<br>
example made of drawn PMMA.<br>
The substrate S1 made of drawn PMMA on which the<br>
abovementioned multilayer was deposited is then<br>
laminated, to S2 at the same time as the connections<br>
are placed thereon, by means of an interlayer f1 made<br>
of PU and an inorganic glass back pane.<br><br>
The cell thus obtained is then cycled between -2 V and<br>
1 V so as to color and bleach it. Irrespective of the<br>
times for coming to equilibrium at a given potential (2<br>
min, 10 min or 60 min), the measured light transmission<br>
levels at the two potentials are close to 50%. The cell<br>
is therefore non-functional and many cracks are<br>
observed, with the naked eye, at the multilayer, these<br>
being the sign of poor adhesion between the organic<br>
substrate and the electronically conductive and/or<br>
electroactive layers.<br>
A fourth example (illustrated by figures 1-3)<br>
corresponds to a "five-layer" system using an organic<br>
substrate of the type consisting of a PMMA slab 4 mm in<br>
thickness on which a polysiloxane-based organic varnish<br>
layer 10 was deposited by flow coating. Precisely the<br>
same metal oxide layers as those described in the third<br>
example were then deposited on the PMMA slab + the<br>
polysiloxane-based varnish, keeping the same deposition<br>
conditions as those used in the third example. The<br>
assembly of the cell by laminations with a PU<br>
interlayer as well as the positioning of the<br>
connections also remain identical to those of the third<br>
example.<br>
The cell thus obtained is then cycled between -2 V and<br>
1 V so as so color and bleach it. The cell thus<br>
switches from a dark blue color to a brownish-gray<br>
color, and the light transmission values, measured<br>
after equilibrium times of 2 minutes, vary from 2% to<br>
50%. The functionality of this cell produced on the<br>
PMMA slab + siloxane-based varnish 10 is completely<br>
satisfactory, with a contrast of 25 and with no<br>
cracking being observed, whether with the naked eye or<br>
with a microscope.<br>
A fifth example illustrates, within the context of the<br>
invention, the protection that the organic varnish on a<br>
polymer substrate such as PMMA provides. Drops of<br><br>
propylene carbonate (about 2 ml) were deposited on 3<br>
PMMA-based substrates:<br>
- bare PMMA;<br>
PMMA + organic (polysiloxane-based) varnish;<br>
PMMA + organic (polysiloxane-based) varnish +<br>
ITO layer.<br>
After several hours at room temperature, the propylene<br>
carbonate reacted with the bare PMMA, whereas no<br>
reaction was observed on the other two substrates.<br>
After wiping, the propylene carbonate drop leaves a<br>
trace on the bare PMMA - this trace corresponds to a<br>
swollen area, with an overall increase in thickness of<br>
about 6 microns relative to the area that was not in<br>
contact with the propylene carbonate.<br>
In addition, on the bare PMMA and on the PMMA + organic<br>
varnish, the areas on which propylene carbonate drops<br>
had been deposited were analyzed using a profilometer<br>
and compared with the areas that had never been in<br>
contact with propylene carbonate. Figures 6a to 9a show<br>
the surface images and the roughness curves thus<br>
obtained (figures 6a to 9b). The surfaces shown in<br>
figures 6a and 7b are very different and in addition,<br>
the average distance PV (the distance between the top<br>
of the peaks and the bottom of the valleys) of the<br>
roughness curves passes from 0.1 to 0.54 microns<br>
between the bare PMMA, on which no solvent was<br>
deposited, and the bare PMMA on which a drop of<br>
propylene carbonate was deposited. This corresponds to<br>
deeper grooves on the bare PMMA in contact with<br>
propylene carbonate than on the bare PMMA that was<br>
never in contact with propylene carbonate. However, the<br>
surface images in figures 8a and 9a are similar and the<br>
average distance PV is identical in the case of the<br>
PMMA + organic varnish area on which a drop of PMMA was<br>
deposited and on the PMMA + organic varnish area on<br>
which no solvent was deposited.<br><br>
