COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL l,3-DIHYDRO-2H-INDOL-2-ONE COMPOUNDS"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO, of 174, Avenue de France, F-75013, Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to compound of formula (la) in the form of the Iaevorotatory isomer.<br>
The present invention relates to novel 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one derivatives, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention have affinity for and selectivity towards the V1b receptors or towards both the V1b and Vla receptors of arginine-vasopressin (AVP).<br>
AVP is a hormone which is known for its antidiuretic effect and its effect in regulating arterial pressure. It stimulates several types of receptor: V1 (V1a, Vlb) , V2 . These receptors are located in particular in the liver, the vessels (coronary, renal and cerebral), the platelets, the kidneys, the uterus, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, the central nervous system and the pituitary gland. AVP thus exerts cardiovascular, hepatic, pancreatic, antidiuretic and platelet-aggregating effects and effects on the central and peripheral nervous system, and on the uterine sphere.<br>
The location of the various receptors is described in: S. Jard et al., Vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: an overview, in  Progress in Endocrinology. H. Imura and K. Shizurne ed., Experta Medica,<br><br>
Amsterdam, 1988, 1183-1188, as well as in the following articles: J. Lab. Clin. Med., 1989, 114,(6), 617-632 and Pharmacol. Rev., 1991, Â£3(1), 73-108.<br>
More particularly, the AVP V1a receptors are located in many peripheral organs and in the brain. They have been cloned in rats and man and they regulate most of the known effects of AVP: platelet aggregation; uterine contractions; the contraction of blood vessels; secretion of aldosterone, Cortisol, CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH); hepatic glycogenolysis, cell proliferation and the main central effects of AVP (hypothermia, memory, etc.).<br>
The V1b receptors were initially identified in the adenohypophysis of various animal species (rats, pigs, bovines, sheep, etc.) including man (S. Jard et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1986, 3_0, 171-177; Y. Arsenijevic et al., J. Endocrinol., 1994, 141, 383-391; J. Schwartz et al., Endocrinology, 1991, 129(2), 1107-1109; Y. De Keyser et al., FEBS Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220) in which they stimulate the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone via AVP and potentiate the effects of CRF on the release of ACTH (G.E. Gillies et al., Nature, 1982, 299, 355). In the hypothalamus, the V1b receptors also induce a direct release of CRF (Neuroendocrinology, 1994, 60, 503-508) and are, in :hese various respects, involved in stress situations.<br><br>
These V1b receptors have been cloned in rats, man and mice (Y. De Keyser, FEBS Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220; T. Sugimoto et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269 43), 27088-27092; M. Saito et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1995, 212 (3), 751-757; S.J. Lolait et al. , Neurobiology, 1996, 92, 6783-6787; M.A. Ventura et al., Journal of Molecular Endocrinology, 1999, .22, 251-260) and various studies {in situ  hybridization, PCR [polymerase chain reaction], etc.) reveal the ubiquitous presence of these receptors in various central tissues (brain, hypothalamus and adenohypophysis in particular) and peripheral tissues (kidney, pancreas, adrenals, heart, lungs, intestine, stomach, liver, mesentery, bladder, thymus, spleen, uterus, retina, thyroid, etc.) and in certain tumours (hypophyseal, pulmonary, etc.) suggesting a broad biological and/or pathological role for these receptors and a potential involvement in various diseases.<br>
By way of example, in rats, studies have shown that AVP regulates the endocrine pancreas, via the V1b receptors, by stimulating the secretion of insulin and glucagon (B. Lee et al., Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Endocrinol. Metab. 32): E1095-E1100, 1995) or the production of catecholamines in the medullo-adrenal which is the site of a local synthesis of AVP (E. Grazzini et al., Endocrinology, 1996, 137(a), 3906-<br><br>
3914). Thus, in the latter tissue, AVP is thought to have a crucial role, via these receptors, in certain types of adrenal pheochromocytomas which secrete AVP and thereby induce a sustained production of catecholamines which are the cause of hypertension and which are resistant to angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and to conversion enzyme inhibitors. The adrenal cortex is also rich in V1a receptors involved in the production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone and Cortisol). Via these receptors, AVP (in the circulation or synthesized locally) can  induce a production of aldosterone with an efficacy which is comparable to that of angiotensin II (G. Guillon et al., Endocrinology, 1995, 136(3), 1285-1295). Cortisol is a powerful regulator of the production of ACTH, the stress hormone.<br>
Recent studies have also shown that the adrenal glands are capable of directly releasing CRF and/or ACTH via activation of the V1b and/or V1a receptors borne by the medullary cells (G. Mazzocchi et al., Peptides, 1997, 18(2), 191-195; E. Grazzini et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 1999, .84(6), 2195-2203).<br>
The V1b receptors are also considered as a label for ACTH-secreting tumours such as  certain pituitary tumours, certain bronchial carcinomas (SCLC [small lung cell cancers]), pancreatic, adrenal and<br><br>
thyroid carcinomas, inducing Cusnmg's, syndrome in certain cases (J. Bertherat et al., Eur. J. Endocrinol., 1996, 135, 173; G.A. Wittert et al., Lancet, 1990, 335, 991-994; G. Dickstein et al. , J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 1996, 81(8), 2934-2941). As regards the Vla receptors, they are a more specific label for small cell lung cancers (SCLC) (P.J. Woll et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1989, 164 (1), 66-73). Thus, the compounds according to the present invention are obvious diagnostic tools and offer a novel therapeutic approach in the proliferation and detection of these tumours, even at an early stage (radiolabelling; SPECT [single photon emission computed tomography]; PET scan [positron emission tomography scanner]).<br>
The abundant presence of the V1b receptor messenger in the stomach and intrstine suggests an involvement of AVP via this receptor on the release of gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin, gastrin or secretin (T. Sugimoto et al., Molecular cloning and functional expression of V1b receptor gene, in Neurohypophysis: Recent Progress of Vasopressin and Oxytocin Research; T. Saito, K. Kurokawa and S. Yoshida ed., Elvesier Science, 1995, 409-413).<br>
1,3-Dihydro-2H-indol-2-one derivatives have been described in certain patent applications as arginine-vasopressin receptor ligands and/or oxytocin<br><br>
receptor ligands: mention may be made of patent<br>
applications WO 93/15051, EP-A-0 636 608.<br>
Ep-A-0 636 609, WO 95/18105, WO 97/15556 and<br>
WO 98/25901.<br>
No non-peptide compound with affinity for and<br>
selectivity towards the V1b receptors or simultaneously<br>
for and towards both the V1b and V1a receptors of<br>
arginine-vasopressin is known to date.<br>
Novel 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one derivatives have now been found which have affinity for and selectivity towards the V1b receptors or for and towards both the V1b and V1a receptors of arginine-vasopressin.<br>
These compounds may be used for the preparation of medicinal products that are useful in the treatment or prevention of any pathology in which arginine-vasopressin and/or the V1b receptors or both the V1b receptors and the V1a receptors are involved, in particular in the treatment or prevention of complaints of the cardiovascular system, for example hypertension; of the central nervous system,, for example stress, anxiety, depression, compulsive obsessive disorder and panic attacks; of the renal system; of the gastric system as well as in the treatment of small cell lung cancers; of obesity; of type II diabetes; of insulin resistance; of hypertriglyceridemia; of atherosclerosis; of Cushing's syndrome; of any pathology following stress and chronic stress states.<br><br><br><br>

as well as the possible salts thereof with mineral or organic acids, and the solvates and/or<br><br>
hydrates thereof are more particularly preferred.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject of the present invention is a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), possible salts thereof with mineral or organic acids, and solvates and/or hydrates thereof, characterized in that:<br>
a compound of formula:<br><br><br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined for a compound of formula (I), is reacted, in the presence of a base, with a halide of formula:<br><br>
in which R7 and R8 are as defined for a compound of formula (I) and Hal represents a halogen atom.<br>
The compound of formula (I) is optionally converted into a salt thereof with mineral or organic acids.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong base, for instance a metal hydride such as sodium hydride or an alkali metal alkoxide such as<br><br><br>
potassium tert-butoxide, in an anhydrous solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran and at a temperature of between -70Â°C and +60Â°C. The reaction is preferably carried out using a compound of formula (III) in which Hal = C1.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R6 represents a (C1-C4)alkyl may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) in which R6 represents hydrogen with a (C1-C4)alkyl halide, in the presence of a base such as a metal hydride, in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran according to the conventional methods.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R6 represents a group - (CH2)n-CO-R9 in which R9 represents a hydroxyl is preferably prepared by hydrolysing a compound of formula (I) in which R6 represents a group - (CH2)n-CO-R9 in which R9 represents a tert-butyloxy, in acidic medium, using a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane or dioxane and at a temperature of between 0Â°C and room temperature.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R6 represents a group -(CH2)n-CO-R9 in which R9 represents a group -NR12R13 is preferably prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) in which R9 represents a hydroxyl with an amine of formula H-NR12R13 according to the conventional methods of peptide coupling.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained may be subsequently separated from the reaction medium and purified according to the conventional methods, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained are isolated in free base or salt form, according to the conventional techniques.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are obtained in free base form, the salification is carried out by treatment with the selected acid in an organic solvent. By treating the free base, dissolved, for example, in an ether such as diethyl ether or in an alcohol such as 2-propanol or in acetone or in dichloromethane, or in ethyl acetate or in acetonitrile, with a solution of the selected acid in one of the abovementioned solvents, the corresponding salt is obtained, which is isolated according to the conventional techniques.<br>
Thus, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, trifluoroacetate, hydrogen sulphate, dihydrogen phosphate, methanesulphonate, oxalate, maleate, succinate, fumarate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, para-toluenesulphonate, gluconate, citrate or acetate is prepared, for example.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the compounds of formula (I) may be isolated in the form of a salt thereof, for example the hydrochloride or oxalate; in<br><br><br>
this case, if necessary, the free base may be prepared by neutralizing the said salt with a mineral or organic base, such as sodium hydroxide or triethylamine or with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, such as sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are prepared by reacting a 3-halo-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one compound of formula:<br><br><br><br>

formula:<br><br>
in which R5 and R6 are as defined for a compound of formula (I). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or a mixture of<br><br>
these solvents and at a temperature of between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. The compounds of formula (III) are known or prepared by known methods such as those disclosed in EP-B-0 469 984 and WO 95/18105. For example, the compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by halogenating the corresponding benzenesulphonic acids or salts thereof, for example the sodium or potassium salts thereof. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a halogenating agent such as phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide or phosphorus pentachloride, without solvent or in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon or N,N-dimethylformamide and at a temperature of between -10Â°C and 2 00Â°C.<br>
2,4-Dimethoxybenzenesulphonyl chloride is prepared according to J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1952, 74, 2008. 3,4-Dimethoxybenzenesulphonyl chloride is commercially available or is prepared according to J. Med. Chem., 1977, 20(10), 1235-1239.<br>
The compounds of formula (IV) are known and are prepared according to known methods such as those disclosed in WO 95/18105.<br>
For example, a compound of formula:<br><br><br><br>

According to another example for preparing the compounds of formula (IV), a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined for a compound of formula (I), is converted into a compound of formula (IV) by means of a halogenating agent such as bromine, according to the process disclosed in Farm. Zh.(Kiev), 1976, 5,   30-33.<br>
The compounds of formula (VI) are known and are prepared according to known methods such as those<br><br><br>
disclosed in WO 95/18105.<br>

(VIII)<br><br>
in which R1 and R2 are as defined for a compound of formula (I), with an organomagnesium derivative of formula:<br><br><br>
MgHal  (IX)<br><br>
in which R3 and R4 are as defined for a compound of formula (I) and Hal represents a halogen atom, preferably bromine or iodine, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether.<br><br>
It is also possible to prepare a compound of formula (VI) in which R3 is as defined for a compound of formula (I) and R4, which is other than hydrogen, is in position -3- or -6- of the phenyl, by reacting a compound of formula:<br>
(XVII)<br>
in which R3 is as defined for a compound of formula (I) and R4 is in position -2- or -5- of the phenyl, with a<br><br><br>
lithium derivative such as n-butyllithium, and the lithiated intermediate thus obtained is then reacted with a compound of formula (VIII). The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or hexane or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of between -7 0Â°C and room temperature.<br>
The lH-indole-2,3-dione derivatives (VIII) are commercially available or are prepared according to the methods disclosed in Tetrahedron Letters, 1998, 3_9, 7679-7682; Tetrahedron Letters, 1994, 35, 7303-7306; J. Org. Chem., 1977, 42(8), 1344-1348; J.   Org. Chem., 1952, 17, 149-156; J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 1946, 68, 2697-27 03; Organic Syntheses, 1925, V, 71-74 and Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, A.R. Katritzky and A.J. Boulton, Academic Press, New York, 1975, 18, 2-58.<br>
The organomagnesium derivatives (IX) are prepared according to the conventional methods that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>

In step al of Scheme 1, a compound of formula (X) is first reacted with a lithium derivative such as n-butyllithium, in the absence or presence of a base such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethylenediamine, and the lithiated intermediate thus obtained is then reacted with diethyl oxalate to give the compound of formula (XI). The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or<br><br><br>
hexane or a mixture of these solvents and at a temperature of between -70Â°C and room temperature.<br>
In step bl, a compound of formula (XII) is first reacted with two equivalents of a lithium 5  derivative such as tert-butyllithium, and the lithiated intermediate thus obtained is then reacted with the compound of formula (XI) to give the expected compound of formula (VI). The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or 3 pentane or a mixture of these solvents and at a temperature of between -70Â°C and room temperature.<br>

The acid (XIII) is reacted in step b2 with ethylamine, dimethylamine or azetidine according to the conventional methods of peptide coupling to give the<br><br>
compound (XIV), which is deprotected, according to the known methods, to give a compound of formula (V) in which R6 = H.<br>
In step d2, the compound (XIV) may be reacted with a (C1-C4)alkyl halide, in the presence of a base such as a metal hydride or an alkali metal carbonate or alkaline-earth metal carbonate such as K2CO3 or Cs2C03, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide and at a temperature of between 0Â°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent, to give a compound (XV).<br>

When it is desired to prepare an optically-pure compound of formula (I), an optically pure compound of formula (II) is preferably reacted with a compound of formula (III) according to the process of the invention.<br>
The optically pure compounds of formula (II) are prepared by reacting the racemic compound of formula (IV) with an optically pure compound of formula (V), followed by separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers according to the conventional methods, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
Alternatively, the mixture of diastereoisomers of the compound of formula (II) can be reacted with the compound of formula (III) and the<br><br>
mixture of diastereoisomers of the compound of formula (I) thus obtained can be separated.<br>
During any of the steps for preparing the compounds of formula (I) or the intermediate compounds   of formula (II), (IV), (V) or (VI), it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect the reactive or sensitive functional groups, such as the amine, hydroxyl or carboxyl groups, present on any of the molecules concerned. This protection may be carried out using conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J.F.W. McOmie, published by Plenum Press, 1973, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991 or in Protecting Groups, Kocienski P.J., 1994, Georg Thieme Verlag. The removal of the protecting groups may be carried out in a suitable subsequent step using the methods known to those skilled in the art which do not affect the rest of the molecule concerned.<br>
The N-protecting groups optionally used are the conventional N-protecting groups that are well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the tert-butoxycarbonyl, fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl, benzyl, benzhydrylidene or benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
