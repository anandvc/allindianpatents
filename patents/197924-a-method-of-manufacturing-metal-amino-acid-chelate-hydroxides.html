The present invention relates to the field of Biochemistry more particulary to method of manufacturing metal amino acid hydroxide chelates. The method is prepared by reacting in an aqueous solution, a calcium or magnesium hydroxide, an amino acid, and a soluble metal chloride salt at a ratio sufficient to react forming a positively charged water insoluble metal amino acid chelate having a hydroxide counter-ion, calcium / magnesium chloride, and water. The metal amino acid chelates of the present invention have a ligand to metal molar ratio from 1:1 to 4:1.<br>
The metal amino acid Hydroxide chelates find excellent use for addition as food / feed supplements. They ensure better bioavailability of the Mineral and the amino acids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amino acid   chelates are   generally produced by the<br>
reaction between a -amino acids and metal ions having a valence of two or more to form a ring structure. In such a reaction, the positive electrical charge of the metal ion is neutralized by the electrons available through the carboxylate or free amino groups of the α-amino acid.<br>
Traditionally, the term "chelate" has been loosely defined as a combination of a metallic ion bonded to one or more ligands forming heterocyclic ring structures. Under this definition, chelate formation through neutralization of the positive charges of the metal ions may be through the formation of ionic, covalent, or coordinate covalent bonding.<br>
A chelate is a definite structure resulting from precise requirement of synthesis. Proper conditions must be present for chelation to take place, including proper mole ratios of ligands to metal ions, pH, and solubility of reactants. For chelation to occur, all components are generally dissolved in solution and are either ionized or of appropriate electronic configuration in order for coordinate covalent bonding and/or ionic bonding between the   ligand   and   the   metal   ion   to   occur.<br><br>
Chelation can be confirmed and differentiated from mixtures of components by infrared spectra through comparison of the stretching of bonds or shifting of absorption caused by bond formation. As applied in the field of mineral nutrition, there are two allegedly "chelated" products which are commercially utilized. The first is referred to as a "metal proteinate." Metal proteinates is defined as the product resulting from the chelation of a soluble salt with amino acids and/or partially hydrolyzed protein. Such products are referred to as the specific metal proteinate, e.g., copper proteinate, zinc proteinate, etc. Sometimes, metal proteinates are even referred to as amino acid chelates, though this characterization is not accurate. This is because by definition, a metal proteinate must contain partially hydrolyzed proteins which may or may not     be     mixed     with     Amino      acids.<br>
The second product, referred to as an "amino acid chelate," when properly formed, is a stable product having one or more five-membered rings formed by a reaction between the carboxyl oxygen, and the α-amino group of an a-amino acid with the metal ion. Such a five-membered ring is defined by the metal atom, the carboxyl oxygen, the carbonyl carbon,<br>
the α-carbon and the a-amino nitrogen. The actual structure will depend upon the ligand to metal mole ratio and whether the carboxyl oxygen forms a coordinate covalent bond or an ionic bond with the metal ion. Generally, the ligand to metal molar ratio is at least 1:1 and is preferably 2:1 or 3:1. However, in certain instances, the ratio may be 4:1. An amino acid chelate may be represented as follows:<br>
A method of manufacturing Metal amino acid chelates comprising of a metal, amino acid and hydroxide ion by the reaction of hydroxide of alkaline earth metal with an amino acid and a soluble metal chloride salt in an aqueous solution with the chelate having the structure 1.<br>
■v..<br><br><br>
Wherein 'R' is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, arylalkoxy, a side chain having branches or ring structured optionally with an hetero atom such as Sulphur, Nitrogen, Halo etc or a peptide group;<br>
'OH' is the Hydroxide ion also linked to the N of the quarternary ammnonium group of the amino acid(s)<br>
'a' is a numerical number that satisfies the valency of the metal 'M'and the amino acid(s) bonded to the Metal which satisfies the valency on the metal thus forming a chelate;<br>
'b' defines an integer to obtain the electrical charge created by the formation of quarternary ammonium complex ion which can be 1 to a;<br>
'e' is the number of Hydroxide ions and an electrical equivalent to nullify the charge 'b';<br><br>
'M' is either metal atom or a metal ion having the positive charge "a" ranging from +1 to +6 preferably +2 to +4;<br>
Amino acid(s) used for chelation may be the same, different or in a combination thereof;<br>
The dotted line between 'N' of amino acid and the metal represents a weak bond, formed due to delocalization of a lone pair of electrons present on the carboxylic oxygen of the amino acid thus forming a five membered ring with the metal ion.<br>
The average molecular weight of the hydrolyzed protein and / or amino acids must be approximately 150 and the resulting molecular weight of the chelate must not exceed 800. The products are identified by the specific metal forming the chelate, e.g., iron amino acid chelate, copper amino acid chelate, etc.<br>
The reason a metal atom can accept bonds over and above the oxidation state of the metal is due to the nature of chelation. For example, at the α-amino group of an amino acid, the nitrogen contributes both of the electrons used in the bonding. These electrons fill available spaces in the d-orbitals forming a coordinate covalent bond. Thus, a metal ion with a normal valency of +2 can be bonded by four bonds when fully chelated. In this state, the chelate is completely satisfied by the bonding electrons and the charge on the metal atom (as well as on the overall molecule) is zero. As stated previously, it is possible that the metal ion be bonded to the carboxyl oxygen by either coordinate covalent bonds or ionic bonds. However,<br>
the metal ion is typically bonded to the a -amino group by coordinate covalent bonds only.<br><br>
Amino acid chelates can also be formed using small peptide ligands instead of single amino acids. These will usually be in the form of dipeptides, tripeptides, and sometimes tetrapeptides because larger ligands have molecular weights that are too great for direct cellular assimilation of the chelate formed. Generally, peptide ligands will be derived by the hydrolysis of protein. However, peptides prepared by conventional synthetic techniques or genetic engineering can also be used. When a ligand is a di- or tripeptide, a radical of the formula [C(0) CHRNH]nH will replace one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen atom in Formula 1. R, as defined in Formula 1, can be H, or the residue of any other naturally occurring amino acid and e can be an integer of 1, 2 or 3. When n is 1 the ligand will be a dipeptide, when n is 2 the ligand will be a tripeptide and so forth.<br>
One advantage of amino acid chelates in the field of mineral nutrition is attributed to the fact that these chelates are readily absorbed in the absorptive mucosal cells or plant cells by means of active transport or other know mechanisms. In other words, the minerals are absorbed along with the amino acids as a single unit utilizing the amino acids as carrier molecules. Therefore, the problems associated with the competition of ions for active sites and the suppression of specific nutritive mineral elements by others are avoided. This is especially true for compounds such as iron sulfates that must be delivered in relatively large quantities in order for the body or plant to absorb an appropriate amount. This is significant because large quantities often cause nausea and other gastrointestinal discomforts in animals as well as create an undesirable taste. Additionally, in plants, large amounts of these compounds can act to burn leaves and cause other undesirable results.<br>
In the past, amino acid chelates have generally been made by first dissolving a water soluble metal salt in water. An amino acid ligand is then reacted with the metal ion at a ratio of ligand to metal from 1:1 to 4:1, preferably 2:1. Often, the ligand is a hydrolysis product obtained by acid, base, base-acid, base-acid-base, or enzyme hydrolysis. In such cases, the by products from hydrolysis, such as anions including chlorides, sulfates, phosphates and nitrates, and cations including potassium and sodium, remain in the hydrolysate.<br><br>
In fact, most water soluble salts used in making amino acid chelates have been either sulfates or chlorides. Using the chloride ion as exemplary, the reaction has generally proceeded according to Formula 2 as follows: STRUCTURE 2<br><br>
where M is a bivalent metal cation and R is a radical of a naturally occurring amino acid, dipeptide or polypeptide. It is apparent from the above formula that the chloride anion is present in the reaction mixture in the form of sodium chloride.<br>
In order to manufacture metal amino acid Hydroxide chelates, it generally requires that the metal salt and the ligand both be dissolved in water. One problem with this is employing metal salts that are soluble but essentially free from anions that can interfere with the chelation process.<br>
In the past, if certain soluble metal salts, such as sulphates, were used as a mineral source for chelation purposes, the resulting anions interfered with the chelation process. For example, the attraction between the lone pair of electrons on the amino group of an amino acid and a hydrogen ion is strong. This is why glycine is represented by the zwitterionic structure H"*'3 NCH2 COO". This strong attraction for the hydrogen ion explains why amino<br><br>
acids are weak acids, e.g., glycine is not easily deprotonated. In water, only about 0.5% of the glycine typically disassociates and releases a hydrogen ion. The introduction of mineral acid salts into solution, such as copper sulfate, resulted in the creation of copper ions which compete with the hydrogen ion for the lone pair of electrons on the NH2 group. Unfortunately, the equilibrium favors the majority of the amino groups remaining protonated. Thus, in order to efficiently chelate metal ions from certain soluble salts, it becomes desirable to render the interfering ions inactive or use soluble metal salts with non-interfering ions, such as oxides or hydroxides.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular process steps and materials disclosed herein because such process steps and materials may vary somewhat. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only. The terms are not intended to be limiting because the scope of the present invention is intended to be limited only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims,  the singular forms "a," "an," and<br>
"the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"Interfering ion" is meant to include any cation or anion which would hinder the formation of the amino acid chelate and which remains in the composition as a charged ion that has not reacted to form either the charged amino acid chelate having a hydroxide counter-ion or the calcium chloride salt. For purposes of the present invention, a hydroxide anion which is preferably complexed to the positively charged amino acid chelate is not considered to be an interfering ion.<br>
"Metal amino acid chelate" or "amino acid chelate" shall include metal ions bonded to ligands forming heterocyclic rings. The bonds may be coordinate covalent, covalent, and/or ionic at the carboxyl oxygen group. However, at the a-amino group, the bond is typically a coordinate covalent<br><br>
bond. Preferred amino acids include all of the naturally occurring amino acids. Additionally, for purposes of the present invention, "amino acid chelate" shall further include any charged amino acid chelate that is electrically balanced by a hydroxide counter ion/ions. For example, a trivalent cation having a ligand to metal molar ratio of 2:1 may be represented by the formula [M(AA)2]+1 [OH]-1 and [M(AA)2]+2 (OH) 2-1 where M is the trivalent metal and AA. is an amino acid. Additionally, a divalent cation having a ligand to metal molar ratio of 1:1 may be represented by the formula MIAA)+ OH" and M(AA)+2 (0H)2-1 where M is the divalent metal and AA is an amino acid. If the amino acid chelate as a whole is in solution, the hydroxide anion and the charged chelate may be in solution or complexed together. If the amino acid chelate has been dried, the hydroxide anion and the charged       chelate   will   likely   be   complexed.<br>
"Metal"  is meant  to  cover all  nutritionally  relevant metals.  Though calcium  is a metal, for purposes of the present  disclosure,  calcium  is  specifically  excluded within this definition unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"Soluble metal chloride" or "soluble metal chloride salt" include  all  divalent  or trivalent metals.    Preferred soluble metal sulfate chloride are comprised of at least one nutritionally relevant metal.<br>
"Nutritionally relevant metals" include metals that are known to be needed by living organisms, particularly plants and mammals, including humans. Metals such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and/or chromium (Cr) , Selenium (Se) among others, are exemplary of nutritionally relevant metals.<br>
Essentially, the present invention includes methods of manufacturing water insoluble metal amino acid chelates free of interfering ions. These chelates are prepared by reacting 1) a calcium oxide or hydroxide, 2) an amino acid, and 3) a soluble metal chloride salt in an aqueous environment at a ratio sufficient to allow substantially all of the ions present in solution to react forming a positively charged water insoluble metal amino acid chelate having a hydroxide counter-ion, and a calcium chloride salt, dissolved in water. Further, the metal amino acid<br><br>
chelates of the present  invention will have a ligand to metal molar ratio from about 1:1 to 4:1.<br>
The amino acid to be used in the present invention is preferably one or more of the naturally occurring amino acid selected from the group consisting of alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, cystine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, hydroxyproline, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, and combinations thereof. However, dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides formed by any combination of the naturally occurring amino acids may also be used. Exemplary metals include those selected from the group consisting of Cu, Zn, Fe, Cr, Co, Mg, Mn,Se and combinations thereof. Therefore, the metal reactant is preferably provided as a chloride salt selected from the group consisting of copper chloride (CuCla), zinc chloride (ZnCla), ferrous chloride (FeCla), manganese chloride (MnCla), cobalt chloride {C0CI2) magnesium chloride(MgCla), ferric chloride [FeCla) chromic choloride [CrCla), Selenious  Chloride   (Se2 CI2) and combinations thereof.<br>
While not wanting to be bound by any theory, a possible mechanism of the process may be broken down into two steps. Step A involves the reaction of one or more amino acids with a calcium oxide or hydroxide in an aqueous environment forming a calcium amino acid chelate or complex product.<br>
Step B involves the reaction of one or more soluble metal chloride salts with the calcium amino acid chelate or complex product formed in Step A. The calcium is displaced by the metal forming a charged metal amino acid chelate having a ligand to metal molar ratio from 1:1 to 2:1. Further, the calcium reacts with the chloride anion to form an inert and calcium chloride which dissolves in water. By-products include the presence of a hydroxide counter-ion which is preferably complexed to the water insoluble metal amino acid chelate balancing the charge of the positively charged chelate.<br>
The amino acid selected from the group consisting of naturally occurring amino acids and combinations thereof. H, when disassociated from amino acid, is a hydrogen ion donor from the carboxyl group present on the amino acid. M<br><br>
   is a nutritionally relevant metal having a valency of +? (excluding calcium) such as Cu, Zn, Fe, Co, Mg, Mn etc or a metal having a valency of +3 for example Fe, Cr OR +4 for example Se.<br>
To illustrate this mechanism further, consider th( reactants copper chloride, calcium oxide, and glycine First, one mole of calcium oxide is reacted with one mole of glycine. After allowing the calcium and glycine to react, copper chloride is added. The log of the equilibrium constant at zero ionic strength for the reaction Ca2 +(Gly)~ Ca{Gly)* where (Gly)" represents a glycine anion, is lesser than the same reaction with copper rather than calcium. Thus, we see that copper has stronger affinity for  the   glycine   ligand  than  does   the   calcium.<br>
It is important to note that the added reactants, i.e., Mg(0H)2 or Ca(0H)2, H(AA), and MCI2, may be added in any order. For example, all three reactants may be added simultaneously or the amino acid and the insoluble metal chloride salt may be added before the calcium or magnesium hydroxide. Addition of sugar aids the solubalisation of calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide in water. Calcium Hydroxide can also be prepared insitu by first dissolving calcium chloride &amp; then reacting it with Sodium Hydroxide. The calcium hydroxide so formed is found to have much better reacting than the one formed conventionally inturn correlating to much better final yields. However, the above equation must be balanced to account for all of the potential interfering ions so that the final product (which includes M(AA)+ OH" + CaCl2 or MgCla ) is free of interfering ions.<br>
One advantage of the water insoluble forms of the metal amino acid chelate is its non hygroscopic character. The product does not contain any water of crystallization molecule thereby providing the highest metal content in its group.<br>
It is important to note that though the methods of the present invention provide metal amino acid chelates free of interfering ions, calcium chloride or magnesium chloride are always a byproduct. However the calcium chloride / magnesium chloride dissolves in water while the water insoluble amino acid chelate substantially separates out of the compound and can be dried by methods commonly known in<br><br>
the art. When the amino acid Hydroxide chelate is water soluble, it needs to be seperated from Calcium / Magnesium chloride by passing it through a Ion Exchange Resin.<br>
As mentioned earlier it is also possible to use peptides instead of the amino acids to produce water insoluble amino acid chelate. Further the soluble metal chloride salts can also be substituted by metal sulphate salts to produce the water insoluble metal amino acid chelates (though in this case the byproduct will also precipitate out along with the desired main product). Further the examples provided in the specification are giver illustrative purpose only and it is not intended that the said invention be restricted to those illustrations alone. These above mentioned novelties including all other substitutions, alterations and modifications of the present invention, without departing from the spirit of the invention are also stressed as a part of this patent application.<br>

Each of the composition examples described herein provide an amount of chelate product produced which precipitates out from the solution.
