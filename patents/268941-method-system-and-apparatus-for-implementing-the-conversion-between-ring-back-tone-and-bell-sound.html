FOR IMPLEMENTING INTERCONVERSION BETWEEN RING BACK TONE AND<br>
RINGING TONE", filed on May 17, 2007, the whole contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of communications, in particular to the<br>
ringtone processing technology, and specifically to a method and a device for configuring the<br>
ring back tone and the ringing tone as well as a method and a system for implementing<br>
interconversion between the ring back tone and the ringing tone.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ring back tone is an audio played for a calling party before a called party picks up the<br>
telephone and answers the call initiated by the calling party. The coloring ring back tone service<br>
developed presently becomes more and more popular due to its strongly customizable service. In<br>
the coloring ring back tone service, various audio files may be played for the calling party in<br>
accordance with the configuration of the user, and further, different ring back tones may be<br>
configured for different calling parties. For example, a group ring back tone or a default ring back<br>
tone may be configured. As for the group ring back tone, an audio file is configured for a contact<br>
group in the address book by the user, the sound of the audio file is the ring back tone for the<br>
group. As a contact user of the contact group initiates a call to the user, the contact user who is a<br>
calling party will hear the sound of this audio file. As for the default ring back tone, there is no<br>
special ring back tone configured for the contact users in the address book by the user. Therefore,<br>
when such a contact user initiates a call to the user, the default ring back tone configured by the<br><br>
user may be heard by the contact user. The coincidence relation between the calling party and the<br>
audio file configured by the user is stored in a ring back tone platform. When a calling party<br>
initiates a call, the ring back tone platform plays the corresponding audio file for the calling party<br>
in accordance with the stored coincidence relation between the calling party and the audio file.<br>
Ringing tone is an audio played for the called party by the user terminal of the called<br>
party when the user is called. The user may configure different ringing tones for different calling<br>
parties via the user terminal, such as a group ringing tone and a default ringing tone. As for the<br>
group ringing tone, it means that an audio file is configured for a contact group in the address<br>
book by the user, the sound of the audio file is the ringing tone for the group. When a contact user<br>
of the contact group initiates a call to the user, the called party will hear the sound of the<br>
corresponding audio file. As for the default ringing tone, it means that no special ringing tone is<br>
configured for the contact users in the address book by the user. Therefore, when such a contact<br>
user initiates a call to the user, the default ringing tone configured by the user may be heard by the<br>
called party.<br>
Presently, there exist three ring back tone schemes, i.e. intelligent network scheme,<br>
calling party end office scheme and called party end office scheme. An example of the present<br>
schemes includes following steps:<br>
Step A: a calling party initiates a call to a service switching point (SSP); the SSP triggers<br>
an intelligent service in accordance with a ring back tone service tag in the call, and reports the<br>
tag to a service control point (SCP); the SCP obtains the ring back tone number and sends the<br>
number to the SSP.<br>
Step B: the SSP initiates a call to the called party and the ring back tone platform<br>
respectively in accordance with the ring back tone number obtained.<br>
Step C: a voice channel via the SSP is determined under the control of the SSP, where the<br>
voice channel connects the called party and the calling party, and a voice channel via the SSP is<br>
established and activated under the control of the SSP, where the voice channel connects the ring<br>
back tone platform and the calling party.<br>
Step D: the ring back tone platform plays a coloring ring back tone for the calling party<br>
via the voice channel between the ring back tone platform and the calling party.<br><br>
Step E: the called party picks up the telephone, so as to activate the voice channel<br>
between the calling party and the called party, and the calling party and the called party<br>
communicate with each other through the voice channel. Meanwhile, the SSP terminates the<br>
connection with the ring back tone platform and releases the resources of the ring back tone<br>
platform.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the architecture of a system for downloading<br>
and configuring the ringing tone in the conventional art. As shown in Figure 1, the system<br>
includes: a ringing tone download server, a push proxy gateway (PPG), a wireless application<br>
protocol (WAP) gateway and a mobile terminal. The ringing tone download server is adapted to<br>
provide the PPG with information of the ringing tone selected by the user, and provide the mobile<br>
terminal with the ringing tone via the WAP gateway in accordance with a ringing tone<br>
downloading request from the mobile terminal. The PPG is adapted to constitute a Push message<br>
in accordance with the ringing tone information from the ringing tone download server, and send<br>
the Push message including ringing tone download information to the mobile terminal. The<br>
mobile terminal is adapted to connect with the WAP gateway in accordance with the Push<br>
message from the PPG, send a ringing tone downloading request to the ringing tone download<br>
server via the WAP gateway, and download the ringing tone provided by the ringing tone<br>
download server via the WAP gateway. Since the information exchange between the mobile<br>
terminal and the WAP gateway is implemented based on WAP, and the information exchange<br>
between the WAP gateway and the ringing tone download server is implemented based on the<br>
hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP), the WAP gateway is adapted to implement the protocol<br>
conversion for the information that is exchanged between the mobile terminal and the ringing<br>
tone download server. Further, the mobile terminal is adapted to configure the received ringing<br>
tone as the ringing tone for a corresponding contact user in the address book in accordance with<br>
the operation of the user. The PPG is mainly adapted to implement the active push of the<br>
information, receive the push request of the WAP information from the ringing tone download<br>
server, and provide the mobile terminal with the WAP information.<br>
Further, the information exchange between the ringing tone download server and the PPG<br>
is implemented based on the Push Access Protocol (PAP), and the information exchange between<br><br>
the PPC and the mobile terminal is implemented based on the Push Over-The-Air protocol<br>
(P-OTA).<br>
The user may log on the ringing tone download server via PC or mobile terminal and<br>
select the ringing tone to be downloaded. When the user logs on the ringing tone download server<br>
via PC, the PC logs on the ringing tone download server through Internet, and the user may select<br>
the ringing tone to be downloaded through the interaction between the PC and the ringing tone<br>
download server. When the user logs on the ringing tone download server via the mobile terminal,<br>
the mobile terminal logs on the ringing tone download server through the WAP gateway, and the<br>
user may select the ringing tone to be downloaded through the interaction between the mobile<br>
terminal and the ringing tone download server.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram showing the flow chart for downloading and configuring the ringing<br>
tone in the conventional art. As shown in Figure 2, the process of downloading and configuring<br>
the ringing tone includes the following steps:<br>
Step 201-Step 202: a user logs on the ringing tone download server via PC or mobile<br>
terminal, and selects the ringing tone to be downloaded through the interaction between the<br>
ringing tone download server and the PC or the mobile terminal.<br>
Step 203: when the ringing tone to be downloaded is selected by the user, the ringing tone<br>
download server provides the PPG with information of the ringing tone selected by the user.<br>
Step 204: when the PPG receives the ringing tone information, it constitutes a Push<br>
message according to the ringing tone information, and then sends the Push message including<br>
the download information of the ringing tone to the mobile terminal. In the subsequent steps, the<br>
mobile terminal is considered, and PC is not considered.<br>
Step 205-Step 206: the mobile terminal receives the Push message, connects to the WAP<br>
gateway in accordance with the Push message, and sends a ringing tone downloading request to<br>
the WAP gateway. When the WAP gateway receives the ringing tone downloading request, it<br>
sends the ringing tone downloading request to the ringing tone download server, and requests to<br>
download the corresponding ringing tone.<br>
Step 207: after receiving the ringing tone downloading request, the ringing tone download<br>
server provides the WAP gateway with the ringing tone selected by the user.<br><br>
Step 208: after receiving the ringing tone, the WAP gateway provides the mobile terminal<br>
with the ringing tone selected by the user.<br>
Step 209: after receiving the ringing tone, the mobile terminal sends a reception<br>
acknowledgement to the WAP gateway, for notifying the WAP gateway that the ringing tone is<br>
successfully received.<br>
Step 210: after receiving the reception acknowledgement, the WAP gateway sends the<br>
ringing tone sending result to the ringing tone download server, for notifying the ringing tone<br>
download server to complete the present ringing tone download.<br>
Step 211: when receiving the ringing tone, the mobile terminal may configure the ringing<br>
tone to be the ringing tone for the corresponding contact user in the address book according to the<br>
operation of the user.<br>
There is no evident temporal sequence when executing Step 209-Step 210 and Step 211.<br>
Step 209-Step 210 and Step 211 may be executed at the same time; or it is possible to execute<br>
Step 209-Step 210 first, and then execute Step 211; or it is also possible to execute Step 211 first,<br>
and then execute Step 209-Step 210.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram showing the system for configuring the ring back tone in<br>
the conventional art. As shown in Figure 3, the system includes: peripheral equipment, a WEB<br>
server and a ring back tone platform. The peripheral equipment is adapted to log on the ring back<br>
tone platform via the WEB server, and request the ring back tone platform to configure the ring<br>
back tone. The ring back tone platform is adapted to configure the ring back tone of the user<br>
terminal in accordance with the ring back tone configuring request, and store the coincidence<br>
relation between the ring back tone configured and the calling party. The WEB server is adapted<br>
to implement the protocol conversion for the information exchanged between the peripheral<br>
equipment and the ring back tone platform. The information exchange between the peripheral<br>
equipment and the WEB server is implemented based on HTTP, and the information exchange<br>
between the WEB server and the ring back tone platform is implemented based on the Simple<br>
Object Access Protocol (SOAP). The peripheral equipment may be a PC.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram showing the flow chart of configuring the ring back tone in the<br>
conventional art. As shown in Figure 4, the process of configuring the ring back tone includes the<br><br>
following steps:<br>
Step 401: the peripheral equipment requests to log on the ring back tone platform, the ring<br>
back tone platform performs authentication on the peripheral equipment. When the<br>
authentication is passed, the peripheral equipment logs on the ring back tone platform.<br>
Step 402-Step 403: the peripheral equipment sends a ring back tone configuring request to<br>
the WEB server, requests to configure the ring back tone. When the ring back tone configuring<br>
request is received, the WEB server sends the ring back tone configuring request to the ring back<br>
tone platform.<br>
Step 404: when the ring back tone configuring request is received, the ring back tone<br>
platform configures the ring back tone for the user terminal in accordance with the ring back tone<br>
configuring request, and stores the coincidence relation between the calling party and the ring<br>
back tone configured.<br>
Step 405-Step 406: when the configuration of the ring back tone is finished, the ring back<br>
tone platform returns the ring back tone configuring result to the WEB server, so as to notify the<br>
peripheral equipment that the ring back tone is successfully configured. When the ring back tone<br>
configuring result is received, the WEB server sends the ring back tone configuring result to the<br>
peripheral equipment.<br>
During the research, it is found by the inventor that interconversion between the ringing<br>
tone and the ring back tone cannot be implemented in the conventional art.<br>
Since the ringing tone and the ring back tone cannot be interconverted into each other in<br>
the conventional art, it cannot be ensured that the ringing tone and the ring back tone of the same<br>
sound may be stored on the terminal and the network side. Even if the ringing tone and the ring<br>
back tone of the same sound are stored on the terminal and the network side, because the<br>
configuration of the ringing tone and the ring back tone is separated and no correlation exists<br>
between them, the configuration has to be initiated and performed respectively, when a user<br>
wants to configure the same ringing tone and ring back tone for a contact user or contact group.<br>
Therefore, the configuration of the ringing tone and the ring back tone has to be initiated<br>
respectively by the user, the operation is fussy, and much inconvenience is brought about with the<br>
user, and is not good for the development and application of the ring back tone service and the<br><br><br>
ringing tone download service.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
There is provided a method for converting the ring back tone into the ringing tone<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention, so as to be able to convert the ring back tone into<br>
the ringing tone on a terminal. As shown in Figure 5, the method mainly includes the following<br>
steps:<br>
Block 1: the network side determines the relevant data of the ringing tone corresponding<br>
to the configured ring back tone, and dispatches the data to the user terminal.<br>
Block 2: the user terminal obtains the ringing tone in accordance with the relevant data.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention provides a method for converting the ring<br>
back tone into the ringing tone, including the following steps:<br>
SteplOl: the ring back tone platform on the network determines a relevant data of a<br>
ringing tone corresponding to a configured ring back tone.<br>
As the ring back tone is stored in the ring back tone data base and the ringing tone are all<br>
numbered, the ring back tone may be a normal ring back tone such as a ringtone that includes<br>
audio, the ring back tone may be a multimedia ring back tone such as a ringtone includes audio,<br>
video or picture etc. The ring back tone platform may determine the rmging tone corresponding<br>
to the configured ring back tone with the coincidence relation between the ring back tone number<br>
and the ringing tone number, and then may further determine the relevant data. The ring back<br>
tone number and the corresponding ringing tone number may be identical. In this case, the ring<br>
back tone platform directly searches for the ringing tone number that is same as the ring back<br><br><br>
tone number, so as to determine the ringing tone corresponding to the configured ring back tone.<br>
Alternatively, the rule for numbering the ring back tone and the ringing tone may be different,<br>
and then the ring back tone number and the corresponding ringing tone number may be different.<br>
In this case, the coincidence relation between the ring back tone number and the ringing tone<br>
number may be obtained with the rule for numbering the ring back tone and the ringing tone, and<br>
further, the ringing tone corresponding to the configured ring back tone may be determined.<br>
There are two examples with respect to the relevant data:<br>
As for one example, the relevant data determined by the ring back tone platform is the<br>
ringing tone itself.<br>
As for another example, the relevant data determined by the ring back tone platform is a<br>
download link URL for the ringing tone.<br>
Stepl02: the ring back tone platform dispatches the relevant data to the user terminal.<br>
In this process, the ring back tone platform may dispatch the relevant data of the ringing<br>
tone corresponding to the ring back tone to a data management system (DMS) at first.<br>
Subsequently, the DMS determines whether a management object (MO) for dispatching<br>
the relevant data exists in the user terminal. If the relevant data exists in the user terminal, the<br>
DMS operates the MO directly so as to dispatch the relevant data to the user terminal.<br>
Otherwise, the DMS sends an MO for dispatching the relevant data to the user terminal.<br>
The user terminal stores the MO sent by the DMS. The DMS operates the MO stored in the user<br>
terminal so as to dispatch the relevant data to the user terminal.<br>
Alternatively, the relevant data may be carried on a node of the MO directly, so as to be<br>
dispatched to the user terminal, when the DMS sends the MO for dispatching the relevant data to<br>
the user terminal.<br>
The DMS may also not determine whether the MO for dispatching the relevant data exists<br>
on the user terminal and send the MO for dispatching the relevant data directly. The specific<br>
process is the same as described above.<br>
Corresponding to the two examples of the relevant data in the SteplOl, there are two<br>
examples of dispatching the relevant data:<br><br><br>
As for the first example, the DMS obtains the information of the ringtone in the user<br>
terminal. The DMS sends the ringing tone to the user terminal as the ringing tone does not exist.<br>
Alternatively, the DMS may send the ringing tone to the user terminal directly.<br>
As for a second example, the DMS obtains the information of the ringtone in the user<br>
terminal. The DMS sends the download link and download command to the user terminal as the<br>
ringing tone does not exist. Alternatively, the DMS may send the download link and download<br>
command to the user terminal directly.<br>
S103: The user terminal obtains the ringing tone in accordance with the relevant data.<br>
Corresponding to the first example in the Stepl0l, the user terminal receives and stores<br>
the ringing tone sent by the DMS.<br>
Corresponding to the second example in the SteplOl, the user terminal executes the<br>
download command sent by the DMS and downloads the ringing tone from the download link<br>
sent by the DMS.<br>
Thus, obtaining the ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone automatically on the<br>
terminal is accomplished.<br>
The user terminal may also adopt a corresponding ringing tone as the active ringing tone<br>
according to the command from the network side, so as to realize the synchronization between<br>
the ring back tone and the ringing tone automatically, even for a logically complex configuration<br>
of the ring back tone. There exist two modes for sending the instruction by the network side.<br>
Mode 1: The MO is sent in a DM mode, so as to implement the configuration of the<br>
ringing tone on the user terminal.<br>
The ring back tone platform correspondingly instructs the DMS to configure the ringing<br>
tone for the user terminal, when an instruction of configuring the terminal ringing tone is<br>
received. In accordance with the instruction sent by the ring back tone platform, the DMS<br>
configures the ringing tone by sending a configuring MO to the user terminal and operating the<br>
configuring MO, or by operating the configuring MO available in the user terminal directly. The<br>
configuring MO sent to the user terminal by the DMS and the MO for dispatching the relevant<br>
data may be sent to the user terminal together, or they may be sent to the user terminal separately.<br><br><br>
In other words, the DMS may dispatch the relevant data of the ringing tone and configure the<br>
ringtone on the terminal simultaneously, or the DMS may dispatch the relevant data of the<br>
ringing tone and configure the ringtone on the terminal separately.<br>
If the instruction of configuring the terminal ringing tone received by the ring back tone<br>
platform carries a terminal ringing tone configuration strategy, and the terminal ringing tone<br>
configuration strategy includes a ringing duration of the ringing tone to be configured, such as a<br>
complex logic, the configuring MO sent by the DMS may include: an MO for configuring the<br>
ringing tone and a scheduling MO for processing the ringing duration. After the above step, the<br>
DMS configures the scheduled task logic for the scheduling MO in accordance with the ringing<br>
duration. The scheduling MO triggers the task logic to operate a ringing tone MO, so as to<br>
implement the configuration of the ringing tone on the user terminal, when the conditions of the<br>
scheduling MO are fulfilled.<br>
Mode 2: The ring back tone number is carried in a CONNECT instruction sent to the<br>
user terminal by the switching center, so that the user terminal rings according to the ring back<br>
tone number.<br>
In the above process of Step 102, when the ring back tone platform dispatches the relevant<br>
data to the user terminal, a table of coincidence relation between the ring back tone number and<br>
the ringing tone number may be sent to the user terminal simultaneously and stored on the user<br>
terminal.<br>
Upon performing the step 103, during the call connection, the switching center obtains<br>
the number of the present ring back tone from the ring back tone platform, and puts the number<br>
obtained into the CONNECT instruction sent to the user terminal. The user terminal extracts the<br>
number contained in the CONNECT instruction. After that, the user terminal searches locally for<br>
the ringing tone corresponding to the number received according to the table of coincidence<br>
relation between the ring back tone number and the ringing tone number, when the table is stored<br>
locally on the user terminal. Optionally the user terminal searches locally for the ringing tone<br>
with the same number, when the table of coincidence relation between the ring back tone number<br>
and the ringing tone number is not stored locally on the user terminal. When the relevant ringing<br>
tone is found, the user terminal rings by taking the found ringing tone as the active ringing tone.<br><br><br>
When the relevant ringing tone is not found, the user terminal rings with the active ringing tone.<br>
The method presented by the invention will be illustrated in detail with the embodiments<br>
hereinafter.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, a ringing tone is sent via a DM mode<br>
directly, and the configuration of the ringing tone on the user terminal is implemented via the MO.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the present embodiment includes following steps.<br>
Step 1: A front end sends a logic command of configuring the ring back tone and an<br>
instruction of configuring the ringing tone to the coloring ring back tone server (CRBT). The<br>
front end may be a Portal or SMS, etc., and the CRBT is included in the ring back tone platform.<br>
Step 2: The CRBT configures the ring back tone, and determines the relevant data of the<br>
ringing tone corresponding to the configured ring back tone.<br>
Step 3: The CRBT sends a ringing tone processing request and the relevant data to the<br>
DMS.<br>
The relevant data may include: ringtone information: a unique identification of the<br>
ringtone, such as the ringtone ID, title, period of validity, size, author, copyright holder;<br>
configuration strategy: such as the strategy of changing the ringtone in accordance with the<br>
period of time; operation command: command of configuring the ringtone, command of deleting<br>
a specific ringtone; data of ringtone: the ringing tone itself. The specific implementation is as<br>
follows:<br><br><br><br>
Step 4: The DMS performs preprocessing, such as converting the format of the command.<br>
When a complex logic exists, the DMS may further determine the scheduled tasks.<br>
Step 5: The DMS establishes a DM management session with the user terminal (Device).<br>
Step 6: The DMS queries the ringtone information and the configuration information of<br>
the ringtone of the user terminal.<br>
Step 7: The user terminal returns a query result to the DMS.<br>
Step 8: The DMS generates an MO for dispatching the relevant data for the user terminal,<br>
an MO for configuring the ringing tone. The DMS may further generate a scheduling MO for<br>
processing the ringing duration as a complex logic exists. The DMS sends a generated MO to the<br>
user terminal, the MO generated will be generally referred to as SoundMO hereinafter. The DMS<br>
sends the ringing tone to the user terminal via the MO. An example of the SoundMO is shown in<br>
Figure 7.<br>
In Figure 7, the ringing tone number, such as 601502000000001001, is stored on an ID<br>
node. This number corresponds to the configured ring back tone number.<br>
The main node corresponding to the MO is as follows:<br><br>
This table indicates the format of the content indicated by the ID.<br>
Downloading the ringtone file may be implemented by executing a Replace command for<br>
the Data node in Figure 7 and sending the ringtone file directly to the Data node.<br><br>
The command of downloading the ringtone is as follows:<br><br>
Remark: If it is indicated in Step 7 that this ringing tone is already stored in the user<br>
terminal, the process proceeds to Step 10. If it is indicated in Step 7 that this ringing tone is<br>
already adapted to be the active ringing tone by the user terminal, the process ends.<br>
Step 9: The user terminal returns the operation result.<br>
Step 10: The DMS sends an installation/configuration command to the user terminal.<br>
The MO as shown in Figure 7 executes an Exec command for an Install node as the<br>
download is completed, so as to accomplish the installation of the ringtone file. The installation<br>
means adding the ringtone file into the ringtone list in the terminal. The added ringtone may not<br>
necessarily be configured as the active ringtone. A command, such as an Exec command, for<br>
operating a ringtone configuring node (Active node) is issued, so as to configure the ringtone to<br>
be the active ringtone.<br>
The command for installing and activating the ringtone is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
Step 11: The user terminal configures the ringing tone according to the command.<br>
Step 12-14: The user terminal returns the configuration result to the network side.<br>
A third embodiment of present invention provides a download link of the ringing tone is<br>
sent in a DM mode, and the configuration and downloading of the ringing tone is implemented<br>
via the MO. As shown in Figure 8, the present embodiment includes following steps.<br>
Step 1: A front end sends a logic command of configuring the ring back tone and an<br>
instruction of configuring the ringing tone to the coloring ring back tone server, the front end may<br>
be a Portal/SMS, etc., and the CRBT is included in the ring back tone platform.<br>
Step 2: The CRBT configures the ring back tone, and determines the relevant data of the<br>
ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone configured.<br>
Step 3: The CRBT sends a ringing tone processing request and the relevant data to the<br>
DMS.<br>
The relevant data includes: ringtone information: a unique identification of the ringtone,<br>
such as the ringtone ID, title, period of validity, size, author, copyright holder; configuration<br>
strategy: such as the strategy of changing the ringtone in accordance with the period of time;<br><br>
operation command: command of configuring the ringtone, command of deleting a specific<br>
ringtone; data of ringtone: the URL address where the ringtone file is stored. The specific<br>
implementation is as follows:<br><br>
Step 4: The DMS performs preprocessing, such as converting the format of the command.<br>
The DMS may further determine the scheduled tasks, as a complex logic exists.<br>
Step 5: The DMS establishes a DM management session with the user terminal (Device).<br>
Step 6: The DMS queries the ringtone information and the configuration information of<br>
the ringtone of the user terminal.<br>
Step 7: The user terminal returns a query result to the DMS.<br>
Step 8: The DMS generates an MO for dispatching the relevant data for the user terminal,<br>
an MO for configuring the ringing tone. The DMS may further generate a scheduling MO for<br>
processing the ringing duration as a complex logic exists. The DMS sends the generated MO to<br>
the user terminal - the generated MO will be generally referred to as SoundMO hereinafter, and<br><br>
sends the download link and download command of the ringing tone to the user terminal via the<br>
MO. An example of the SoundMO is shown in Figure 7.<br>
In the Figure 7, the ringing tone number, such as 601502000000001001, is stored on an<br>
ID node. This number corresponds to the number of the ring back tone configured.<br>
The main node corresponding to the MO is as follows:<br><br>
This table indicates the format of the content indicated by the ID.<br>
Downloading the ringtone file may be implemented by executing a Replace command for<br>
the URL node in Figure 7 to dispatch the download address of the ringtone file, and then<br>
executing an Exec command for the Download node to make the terminal download the ringtone<br>
from a content server.<br>
The command of downloading the ringtone is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
For example, in this process, if it is indicated in Step 7 that this ringing tone is already<br>
stored in the user terminal, the process proceeds to Step 12. If it is indicated in Step 7 that this<br>
ringing tone is already configured as the active ringing tone by the user terminal, the process<br>
ends.<br>
Step 9: The user terminal sends out a data downloading request according to the content<br>
server, so as to download the ringing tone from the download link. This step may also be<br>
implemented between step 12 and step 13.<br>
Step 10: The content server returns the ringing tone in the download link to the user<br>
terminal.<br>
Step 11: The user terminal returns an operation result to the DMS.<br>
Step 12: The DMS sends an installation/configuration command to the user terminal.<br>
The MO as shown in Figure 7 executes an Exec command for an Install node when the<br>
download is completed, so as to accomplish the installation of the ringtone file. The installation<br>
means adding the ringtone file to the ringtone list in the terminal. The added ringtone may not<br>
necessarily be configured to be the active ringtone. A command, such as an Exec command, for<br>
operating a ringtone configuring node (Active node) is issued, so as to configure the ringtone to<br>
be the active ringtone. The command for installing and activating the ringtone is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
Step 13: The user terminal configures the ringing tone according to the command.<br>
Steps 14-16: The user terminal returns a configuration result to the network side.<br>
A forth embodiment of present invention provides a scheme in which a ringing tone is<br>
sent via a DM mode directly. During the establishment of the call, the switching center sends a<br>
CONNECT instruction carrying the number of current ring back tone to the user device, so as to<br>
trigger a corresponding ringing tone. The present embodiment includes following steps.<br>
Steps 1-10 are the same as the process of steps 1-10 mentioned in the first embodiment.<br>
Step 11: During the calling, a switching center connected with the CRBT server in the<br>
ring back tone platform queries the information of the ring back tone in the CRBT and obtains the<br>
number of the current ring back tone. The switching center may be a calling MSC or called MSC<br>
in a GSM network, a switch in a fixed network, or a Proxy server transmitting an Invite<br>
command.<br>
Step 12: The number of the current ring back tone is carried in a CONNECT instruction<br>
as the CONNECT instruction is sent to the called user terminal.<br>
In this process, the method of carrying the number of the current ring back tone is<br>
extending the CONNECT instruction sent by the switching center to the user terminal. The<br>
extended CONNECT instruction may be a CONNECT instruction in the intelligent network or<br>
may be the Invite command of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).<br><br>
The following is an embodiment of the extension of the Invite command of SIP. The<br>
extended part may be as follows:<br>
The following is an example of the extended Invite command, where the SoundID is an<br>
extended message header.<br>

Step 13: The called user terminal searches for the corresponding ringing tone in the<br>
terminal locally in accordance with the number in the received command. If the corresponding<br>
ringing tone exists, the terminal rings with the ringtone found for the user. Otherwise, the<br>
ringtone currently configured on the terminal is used for ringing.<br>
In this process, the ringing logic of the user terminal is changed to some extent. The<br>
changed logic is as shown in Figure 9.<br>
When receiving the CONNECT instruction, the user terminal firstly obtains the<br>
configuration on the terminal to determine whether to ring. If yes, it determines whether a ring<br>
back tone number is carried in the CONNECT instruction. Otherwise, the user terminal vibrates.<br>
If the CONNECT instruction carries a ring back tone number, this number is extracted,<br>
and the corresponding ringing tone is searched for locally. If the corresponding ringing tone is<br>
found, the parameter of the ringtone on the terminal, such as volume, is obtained, and the user<br>
terminal rings. Otherwise, the user terminal rings with the currently configured ringtone. If the<br>
CONNECT instruction does not carry a ring back tone number, the user terminal uses the<br><br>
currently configured ringtone on the user terminal for ringing directly.<br>
It is required in the fourth embodiment that the CONNECT instruction should be sent to<br>
the called user terminal after obtaining the data of the ring back tone from the CRBT. The fourth<br>
embodiment may not be adopted for the ring back tone implementation scheme in which the<br>
CONNECT instruction is sent to the user terminal before the data of the ring back tone is<br>
obtained from the CRBT.<br>
There is further provided a ring back tone platform. The interface between the ring back<br>
tone platform and the DMS is responsible for transmitting the relevant data of the ringing tone as<br>
well as the configuration command of the ringing tone, the relevant data of the ringing tone<br>
includes the ringing tone, the download link URL of the ringing tone etc.. This interface may be<br>
implemented with DM Web Service Interface (DM WSI), or may use a private interface between<br>
the ring back tone platform and the DMS, such as customized RPC invoke.<br>
The ring back tone platform according to the invention includes: a ring back tone data<br>
module, a ringtone management module, a ringing tone data dispatching module and a terminal<br>
ringing tone data module, the above modules are connected in sequence.<br>
The ring back tone data module is adapted to store the ring back tone.<br>
The ringtone management module is adapted to configure the ring back tone, and trigger<br>
the ringing tone data dispatching module when an instruction of downloading the ringing tone is<br>
received, as well as trigger a terminal ringing tone configuration module when an instruction of<br>
configuring the ringing tone of the terminal is received.<br>
The ringing tone data dispatching module is adapted to search for the ringing tone<br>
corresponding to the currently configured ring back tone in the terminal ringing tone data module,<br>
and dispatch the relevant data of the ringing tone to the user terminal.<br>
The ringing tone stored in the terminal ringing tone data module corresponds to the ring<br>
back tone stored in the ring back tone data module. The terminal ringing tone data module may<br>
also be arranged in a content server, where the content server is independent from the ring back<br>
tone platform.<br>
In a fifth embodiment of the present invention, provides a scheme for realizing the<br><br><br>
synchronization between the ringtone of the ring back tone and the ringing tone automatically,<br>
corresponding to the Mode 1 for sending the instruction by the network side in the above method,<br>
a terminal ringing tone configuration module connected with the ringtone management module is<br>
included, as shown in Figure 10. Further, a strategy configuration module connected with the<br>
terminal ringing tone configuration module is included.<br>
The terminal ringing tone configuration module is adapted to generate a ringtone<br>
configuration logic on the terminal according to the terminal ringing tone configuration strategy,<br>
and send configuration commands to the terminal. The terminal ringing tone configuration<br>
module may also send a delete command, the delete command carries the number of the terminal<br>
ringing tone corresponding to the currently configured ring back tone, to the terminal, when it is<br>
known that the ring back tone fails.<br>
The strategy configuration module may be used by the user to configure a strategy, or by<br>
the system to configure a default strategy, the strategy is the condition for generating the ringtone<br>
configuration logic on the terminal by the terminal ringing tone configuration module.<br>
In a sixth embodiment of present invention, for automatically realizing the<br>
synchronization between the ringtone of the ring back tone and the ringing tone, a number<br>
providing module connected with the ring back tone data module is included corresponding to<br>
the Mode 2 for sending the instruction by the network in the above method, as shown in Figure<br>
11.<br>
The number providing module is adapted to provide the switching center with the<br>
corresponding ring back tone number during the call connection.<br>
There is further provided a user terminal according to an embodiment of the invention,<br>
the user terminal includes a first MO saving module and an obtaining module connected with<br>
each other.<br>
The first MO saving module is adapted to save the MO sent by the DMS and used for<br>
dispatching the relevant data of the ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone.<br>
The obtaining module is adapted to obtain the ringing tone in accordance with the<br>
relevant data sent by operating the MO saved in the first MO saving module by the network side.<br><br><br>
In a seventh embodiment of present invention, for automatically realizing the<br>
synchronization between the ringtone of the ring back tone and the ringing tone, a second MO<br>
saving module and a first executing module connecting with each other are included<br>
corresponding to the Mode 1 for sending the instruction by the network side in the above method,<br>
as shown in Figure 12.<br>
The second MO saving module is adapted to save the MO for configuring the ringing tone<br>
sent by the network side, or is adapted to save the MO for configuring the ringing tone and a<br>
scheduling MO for processing the ringing duration sent by the network side.<br>
The first executing module is adapted to operate the MO for configuring the ringing tone<br>
saved in the second MO saving module in accordance with the command sent by the network<br>
side, so as to accomplish the ringing tone configuration for the user. Optionally the first executing<br>
module is adapted to operate the MO for configuring the ringing tone saved in the second MO<br>
saving module in accordance with the command sent by the scheduling MO saved in the second<br>
MO saving module, so as to accomplish the ringing tone configuration for the user.<br>
In an eighth embodiment of present invention, for automatically realizing the<br>
synchronization between the ringtone of the ring back tone and the ringing tone, a number<br>
identifying module, a searching module and a second executing module connected in sequence<br>
are included corresponding to the Mode 2 for sending the instruction by the network side in the<br>
above method, as shown in Figure 13.<br>
The number identifying module is adapted to identify the number in the CONNECT<br>
instruction.<br>
The searching module is adapted to search locally for the ringing tone corresponding to<br>
the number identified by the number identifying module.<br>
The second executing module is adapted to play the ringing tone found by the searching<br>
module.<br>
The method for obtaining the ringtone on the terminal according to the invention is not<br>
limited to dispatching the relevant data of the terminal ringing tone to the user terminal via the<br>
DM mode. Alternatively, the ringing tone and the ringtone configuration instruction may be sent<br>
with a multimedia message. The configuration instruction may be an AT instruction or an<br><br><br>
extended special instruction.<br>
For example, when receiving the instruction of configuring a ring back tone to be a<br>
terminal ringing tone, the ring back tone platform generates a multimedia message, and the<br>
content of the multimedia message is the ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone. A<br>
special identifier is set in the multimedia message. Then the ring back tone platform interacts<br>
with the multimedia message service (MMS) server and sends the multimedia message to the<br>
user terminal. The user terminal identifies the special identifier carried in the multimedia<br>
message and learns that the ringtone carried in the multimedia message is used for ringing tone<br>
configuration. Then the ringtone carried in the multimedia message is extracted and saved.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment, it is also possible to realize the synchronization between the<br>
ringtone of the ring back tone and the ringing tone. For example, the ringtone configuration<br>
instruction is sent with a short message or a multimedia message, so as to accomplish the ringing<br>
tone configuration on the user terminal. Alternatively, during the calling, the number of the<br>
current ring back tone is carried in the CONNECT instruction, and then the corresponding<br>
ringing tone is identified and searched for by the user terminal.<br>
A system for converting the ring back tone into the ringing tone according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, includes:<br>
a network element on the network side, adapted to determine the relevant date of the<br>
ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone configured, and dispatch the relevant data;<br>
a user terminal, adapted to obtain the ringing tone in accordance with the relevant data<br>
dispatched by the network side; and<br>
a ring back tone platform on the network side, adapted to determine the relevant data of<br>
the ringing tone corresponding to the ring back tone configured, and forward the relevant data to<br>
the user terminal via the device management server (DMS). Specifically, the DMS dispatches the<br>
relevant data to the user terminal by sending to the user terminal a management object (MO) used<br>
for dispatching the relevant data, or by operating the MO used for dispatching the relevant data<br>
already available in the user terminal.<br>
In the scheme provided in an embodiment of the invention, the ringing tone download<br>
server receives the result of the ring back tone configuration provided by the ring back tone<br><br><br>
platform, and provides the user terminal with the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the<br>
ring back tone configuration via a gateway. The user terminal configures the above ringing tone<br>
to be the ringing tone of the calling party in the result of the ring back tone configuration. In other<br>
words, the ring back tone platform notifies the ringing tone download server of the result of the<br>
ring back tone configuration, when the configuration of the ring back tone is completed<br>
according to the request of the user. The ringing tone download server provides the user terminal<br>
with the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration, when the<br>
result of the ring back tone configuration is received. The user terminal configures this ringing<br>
tone as the ringing tone of the calling party in the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
When the download of the ringing tone is triggered by the configuration of the ring back<br>
tone, the system used for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone includes the ring<br>
back tone platform, the ringing tone download server and the user terminal. The relation of<br>
connection is as shown in Figure 14. The ring back tone platform is adapted to configure the ring<br>
back tone according to the request of the user, and notify the ringing tone download server of the<br>
result of the ring back tone configuration. The ringing tone download server is adapted to receive<br>
the result of the ring back tone configuration, and provide the user terminal with the ringing tone<br>
corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration. The user terminal is adapted to<br>
receive the ringing tone, and configure the received ringing tone to be the ringing tone of the<br>
calling party in the result of the ring back tone configuration in accordance with the operation of<br>
the user. A gateway may be further included between the user terminal and the ringing tone<br>
download server. The gateway is adapted to transmit the information exchanged between the user<br>
terminal and the ringing tone download server. The system for configuring the ringing tone and<br>
the ring back tone may further include a WEB server. The user may log on the ring back tone<br>
platform via the WEB server with peripheral equipment, and request the ring back tone platform<br>
to configure the ring back tone. Alternatively, the user may also log on the ring back tone<br>
platform with other methods. For example, the user may log on the ring back tone platform with<br>
the user terminal directly.<br>
Figure 15 is a first schematic diagram showing the architecture of a system for<br>
configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone according to an embodiment of the invention.<br><br><br>
As shown in Figure 15, the gateway shown in Figure 14 may include a Push Proxy Gateway<br>
(PPG) and a WAP gateway. At this point, the ringing tone download server is adapted to provide<br>
the PPG with the ringing tone information, and provide the WAP gateway with the ringing tone<br>
according to the ringing tone downloading request from the WAP gateway. The PPG is adapted to<br>
construct a Push message according to the ringing tone information from the ringing tone<br>
download server, and send the Push message including the ringing tone download information to<br>
the user terminal. The WAP gateway is adapted to transmit the ringing tone and the ringing tone<br>
downloading request exchanged between the user terminal and the ringing tone download server.<br>
The user terminal is connected to the WAP gateway with the Push message from the PPG, sends a<br>
ringing tone downloading request to the ringing tone download server, and downloads the ringing<br>
tone provided by the ringing tone download server via the WAP gateway.<br>
The PPG needs to send the Push message to the user terminal according to the ringing<br>
tone information provided by the ringing tone download server. However, if the message<br>
processing unit of the user terminal is not turned on, the user terminal may not receive the Push<br>
message, which may lead to a failure. Therefore, an embodiment of the invention puts forward<br>
the following solution. When the message processing unit of the user terminal is turned on, an<br>
online message is sent to the WAP gateway; when the message processing unit of the user<br>
terminal is turned off, an offline message is sent to the WAP gateway. The ID of the message<br>
processing unit is carried in the online message or the offline message. The ID of the user<br>
terminal may be adopted as the ID of the message processing unit. Thus, an online list of the<br>
message processing unit of each user terminal is maintained in the WAP gateway, and the ID of<br>
the online message processing unit is contained in this online list. When an online message sent<br>
by the message processing unit of a user terminal is received, the ID of the message processing<br>
unit of this user terminal is added to the online list. When an offline message sent by the message<br>
processing unit of a user terminal is received, the ID of the message processing unit of this user<br>
terminal is deleted from the online list. The ringing tone download server inquires of the WAP<br>
gateway about whether the message processing unit of a corresponding user terminal is online. If<br>
yes, the ringing tone download server provides the PPG with the ringing tone information.<br>
Otherwise, the ringing tone information is buffered in a message queue by the ringing tone<br><br><br>
download server. When it is determined that the message processing unit of the user terminal is<br>
online, the ringing tone information is provided for the PPG. The method used by the ringing tone<br>
download server to learn that the message processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is<br>
online includes: inquiring of the WAP gateway periodically about the online list, or requesting<br>
the WAP gateway to send a notification to the ringing tone download server when the message<br>
processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is online.<br>
To prevent the situation that the message processing unit is accidentally turned off<br>
without sending the offline message to the WAP gateway because of the accidental turning off of<br>
the user terminal from occurring, a valid time threshold may be configured in the WAP gateway.<br>
When the online time length of the message processing unit of a user terminal is larger than the<br>
valid time threshold, it may be deemed that the message processing unit of this user terminal is<br>
already offline, and the ID of the message processing unit of this user terminal is deleted from the<br>
online list. When the WAP gateway receives the online message of the message processing unit<br>
of this user terminal again, the ID of the message processing unit is added to the online list.<br>
Figure 16 is a diagram showing a first flow chart for configuring the ringing tone and the<br>
ring back tone according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 16, in the<br>
present embodiment, the process for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone includes<br>
the following steps:<br>
Step 701: The ring back tone platform configures the ring back tone of the user terminal<br>
according to the request of the user. The user may log on the ring back tone platform via a WEB<br>
server with peripheral equipment, and request the ring back tone platform to configure the ring<br>
back tone. Alternatively, the user may log on the ring back tone platform with other methods. For<br>
example, the user may log on the ring back tone platform with the user terminal directly.<br>
Step 702: When the ring back tone platform completes the configuration of the ring back<br>
tone, it notifies the ringing tone download server of the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
The result of the ring back tone configuration may include the user information and the ring back<br>
tone information at least. When the user sets an audio file to be the ring back tone, the result of<br>
the ring back tone configuration may also include the user information and the coincidence<br>
relation between the ring back tone and the calling party.<br><br><br>
Step 703: The ringing tone download server receives the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration, determines the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration, and then inquires of the WAP gateway about the ID of the message processing unit<br>
of the user terminal contained in the online list, so as to determine whether the message<br>
processing unit of the user terminal corresponding to the user information is online. If the<br>
message processing unit of the user terminal is online, the process proceeds to Step 704;<br>
otherwise, the ringing tone information is buffered in the message queue. The method used by the<br>
ringing tone download server to learn that the message processing unit of the corresponding user<br>
terminal is online includes: inquiring of the WAP gateway periodically about the online list, or<br>
requesting the WAP gateway to send a notification to the ringing tone download server when the<br>
message processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is online.<br>
Step 704: The ringing tone download server provides the PPG with the ringing tone<br>
information corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
Step 705: After receiving the ringing tone information, the PPG constructs a Push<br>
message according to the ringing tone information, and then sends the Push message including<br>
the ringing tone download information to the user terminal.<br>
Step 706: When receiving the Push message, the user terminal searches in the files saved<br>
locally to determine whether a file conforming to the ringing tone exists. If yes, Step 713 is<br>
executed directly; otherwise, the process proceeds to Step 707. The file conforming to the ringing<br>
tone refers to the file stored locally and whose file format conforms to the format of the ringing<br>
tone. Accordingly, the file not conforming to the ringing tone refers to the file not stored locally,<br>
or whose file format does not conform to the format of the ringing tone.<br>
Before searching for the file conforming to the ringing tone, the user terminal may first<br>
prompt an operation interface to the user to ask whether the user wants to download the ringing<br>
tone. If the confirmation of the user is received, proceed to execute Step 706; otherwise, the<br>
present flow ends directly, i.e. no operation is performed.<br>
Step 707-Step 708: The user terminal connects to the WAP gateway according to the<br>
received Push message, and sends a ringing tone downloading request to the WAP gateway.<br>
When the WAP gateway receives the ringing tone downloading request, it sends the ringing tone<br><br><br>
downloading request to the ringing tone download server, and requests to download the<br>
corresponding ringing tone.<br>
Step 709: After receiving the ringing tone downloading request, the ringing tone<br>
download server provides the WAP gateway with the ringing tone corresponding to the result of<br>
the ring back tone configuration.<br>
Step 710: After receiving the ringing tone, the WAP gateway provides the user terminal<br>
with the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
Step 711: After receiving the ringing tone, the user terminal sends a reception<br>
acknowledgement to the WAP gateway to notify the WAP gateway that the ringing tone is<br>
received successfully.<br>
Step 712: After receiving the reception acknowledgement, the WAP gateway sends the<br>
result of the ringing tone configuration to the ringing tone download server, so as to notify the<br>
ringing tone download server to finish the present ringing tone download.<br>
Step 713: After receiving the ringing tone, the user terminal may configure this ringing<br>
tone to be the ringing tone of the calling party in the result of the ring back tone configuration<br>
according to the operation of the user.<br>
There is no evident temporal sequence when executing Step 711-Step 712 and Step 713.<br>
Step 711-Step 712 and Step 713 may be executed at the same time; or it is possible to execute<br>
Step 711-Step 712 first, and then execute Step 713; or it is also possible to execute Step 713 first,<br>
and then execute Step 711 -Step 712.<br>
It is also possible to substitute the following steps for the aforementioned Step 703 to Step<br>
713, i.e. the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Download mode may be adopted to dispatch the<br>
relevant data of the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
The specific steps are as follows.<br>
Step 1: The ringing tone download server receives the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration, determines the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration, and then pushes the Download Descriptor (DD) file of the ringing tone to the user<br>
terminal. This file is adapted to describe the information of the ringtone file to be downloaded.<br><br><br>
The information mainly includes: provider information, file size, installation parameter, and<br>
installation notification message etc. The push may be implemented with the WAP Push<br>
mechanism or the MMS mechanism. When the WAP Push is adopted, the ApplicationID should<br>
use x-oma-application:dlota.ua, where the binary form is Oxll. An example of the DD file is as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Step 2: The user terminal analyses the received DD file, determines whether the<br>
capability of the terminal satisfies the requirements for download, such as whether the memory is<br>
enough, and downloads the ringtone file according to the address information in the ObjectURI<br>
element in the DD file. The download is implemented by sending an HTTP request to the address<br>
indicated by the ObjectURI.<br>
Step 3: When the download is finished, the user terminal performs the ringing tone<br>
configuration according to the instruction of the installNotifyURI in the DD file. If the DD also<br>
includes an installParam element, the ringing tone configuration is performed according to the<br>
instruction of the installation parameters in the installParam element.<br>
Step 4: When the ringing tone configuration is finished, the user terminal reports the<br>
information of the configuration result to a designated server according to the address<br>
information in the installNotifyURI in the DD file. The HTTP information is used for the<br>
reporting.<br><br>
An embodiment of the invention further provides a method for converting the ringing<br>
tone into the ring back tone, and the method includes the following main steps.<br>
When the ringing tone configuration is finished, the user terminal reports the result of the<br>
ringing tone configuration to the ring back tone platform. The ring back tone platform classifies<br>
the ring back tone corresponding to the ringing tone into the ring back tone pool of this user<br>
terminal according to the result of the ringing tone configuration.<br>
An embodiment of the invention further provides a system for converting the ringing tone<br>
into the ring back tone, the system includes:<br>
a user terminal, adapted to configure the ringing tone and report the result of the ringing<br>
tone configuration; and<br>
a ring back tone platform, adapted to classify the ring back tone corresponding to the<br>
ringing tone into the ring back tone pool of this user terminal according to the result of the<br>
ringing tone configuration reported by the user terminal.<br>
Further, the user terminal finishes the ringing tone configuration according to the<br>
operation of the user, and requests, according to the operation of the user, the ring back tone<br>
platform to configure the ring back tone based on the result of the ringing tone configuration. The<br>
ring back tone platform configures the ring back tone of the user terminal according to the<br>
request received.<br>
When the configuration of the ring back tone is triggered by the configuration of the<br>
ringing tone, the system for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone may include a<br>
user terminal and a ring back tone platform. The relation of connection is as shown in Figure 14,<br>
where the user terminal is adapted to configure the ringing tone according to the operation of the<br>
user, and request, according to the operation of the user, the ring back tone platform to configure<br>
the ring back tone based on the result of the ringing tone configuration. The ring back tone<br>
platform is adapted to configure the ring back tone of the user terminal according to the received<br>
request.<br>
When the configuration of the ring back tone is triggered by the configuration of the<br>
ringing tone, the system for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone may include a<br>
user terminal, a ring back tone platform and a ringing tone download server. The relation of<br><br>
connection is as shown in Figure 14, where the user terminal is adapted to configure the ringing<br>
tone according to the operation of the user, such as configuring the ringing tone to be the ringing<br>
tone for a corresponding contact user in the address book, and request, according to the operation<br>
of the user, the ring back tone platform to configure the ring back tone based on the result of the<br>
ringing tone configuration. The ring back tone platform is adapted to configure the ring back tone<br>
of the user terminal according to the received request. The ringing tone download server is<br>
further adapted to transmit the information exchanged between the user terminal and the ring<br>
back tone platform. The ringing tone download server is adapted to provide the user terminal<br>
with the ringing tone. A gateway may be configured between the user terminal and the ringing<br>
tone download server, for transmitting the information exchanged between the user terminal and<br>
the ringing tone download server.<br>
When the download of the ringing tone is not involved, the system for configuring the<br>
ringing tone and the ring back tone may include a user terminal, a gateway, a WEB server and a<br>
ring back tone platform. The relation of connection is as shown in Figure 14, where the user<br>
terminal is adapted to configure the ringing tone according to the operation of the user, and<br>
request, according to the operation of the user, the ring back tone platform to configure the ring<br>
back tone based on the result of the ringing tone configuration. The ring back tone platform is<br>
adapted to configure the ring back tone of the user terminal according to the received request.<br>
The gateway and the WEB server are adapted to transmit the information exchanged between the<br>
user terminal and the ring back tone platform.<br>
When the user terminal requests the ring back tone platform to configure the ring back<br>
tone based on the result of the ringing tone configuration, the request may be sent to the ring back<br>
tone platform via the ringing tone download server. When the system includes a gateway, the<br>
request may also be sent to the ring back tone platform via the gateway and the ringing tone<br>
download server. When the system includes the gateway and the WEB server, the request may<br>
also be sent to the ring back tone platform via the gateway and the WEB server.<br>
The ring back tone platform is adapted to return the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration to the user terminal. The result of the ring back tone configuration may be sent to<br>
the user terminal via the ringing tone download server. When the system includes a gateway, the<br><br><br>
result of the ring back tone configuration may also be sent to the user terminal via the ringing<br>
tone download server and the gateway. When the system includes the gateway and the WEB<br>
server, the result of the ring back tone configuration may also be sent to the user terminal via the<br>
WEB server and the gateway.<br>
Figure 17 is a second schematic diagram showing the architecture of a system for<br>
configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, the gateway shown in the Figure 14 may include a PPG and a WAP<br>
gateway. At this point, the ringing tone download server is adapted to provide the PPG with the<br>
ringing tone information, and provide the WAP gateway with the ringing tone according to the<br>
ringing tone downloading request from the WAP gateway. The PPG is adapted to construct a<br>
Push message according to the ringing tone information from the ringing tone download server,<br>
and send the Push message including the ringing tone download information to the user terminal.<br>
The user terminal is connected to the WAP gateway with the Push message from the PPG, sends a<br>
ringing tone downloading request to the ringing tone download server via the WAP gateway, and<br>
downloads the ringing tone provided by the ringing tone download server via the WAP gateway.<br>
When the ring back tone platform returns the result of the ring back tone configuration to<br>
the user terminal via the ringing tone download server and the PPG, the ringing tone download<br>
server is further adapted to provide the PPG with the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
The PPG is further adapted to construct the Push message according to the result of the ring back<br>
tone configuration from the ringing tone download server, and send the Push message containing<br>
the result of the ring back tone configuration to the user terminal. To prevent the user terminal<br>
from mixing up the original Push message and the Push message containing the result of the ring<br>
back tone configuration, the Push message may be received via a separately configured port, or<br>
may be received via the original port, however, the information which can embody the function<br>
of this Push message should be carried in this Push message.<br>
The PPG needs to send the Push message to the user terminal according to the result of<br>
the ring back tone configuration provided by the ringing tone download server. However, if the<br>
message processing unit of the user terminal is not turned on, the user terminal may not receive<br>
the Push message. Therefore, an embodiment of the present invention puts forward the following<br><br><br>
solution. When the message processing unit of the user terminal is turned on, an online message<br>
is sent to the WAP gateway; when the message processing unit of the user terminal is turned off,<br>
an offline message is sent to the WAP gateway. The ID of the message processing unit is carried<br>
in the online message or the offline message. The ID of the user terminal may be adopted as the<br>
ID of the message processing unit. Thus, an online list of the message processing unit of each<br>
user terminal is maintained in the WAP gateway, and the ID of the online message processing unit<br>
is contained in this online list. When an online message sent by the message processing unit of a<br>
user terminal is received, the ID of the message processing unit of this user terminal is added to<br>
the online list. When an offline message sent by the message processing unit of a user terminal is<br>
received, the ID of the message processing unit of this user terminal is deleted from the online list.<br>
Before providing the PPG with the result of the ring back tone configuration, the ringing tone<br>
download server inquires of the WAP gateway about whether the message processing unit of the<br>
corresponding user terminal is online. If yes, the ringing tone download server provides the PPG<br>
with the result of the ring back tone configuration. Otherwise, the result of the ring back tone<br>
configuration is buffered in a message queue by the ringing tone download server. When it is<br>
determined that the message processing unit of the user terminal is online, the result of the ring<br>
back tone configuration is provided for the PPG The method used by the ringing tone download<br>
server to learn that the message processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is online<br>
includes: inquiring of the WAP gateway periodically about the online list, or requesting the WAP<br>
gateway to send a notification to the ringing tone download server when the message processing<br>
unit of the corresponding user terminal is online.<br>
To prevent the situation that the message processing unit is accidentally turned off<br>
without sending the offline message to the WAP gateway because of the accidental turning off of<br>
the user terminal from occurring, a valid time threshold may be configured in the WAP gateway.<br>
When the online time length of the message processing unit of a user terminal is larger than the<br>
valid time threshold, it may be deemed that the message processing unit of this user terminal is<br>
already offline, and the ID of the message processing unit of this user terminal is deleted from the<br>
online list. When the WAP gateway receives the online message of the message processing unit<br>
of this user terminal again, the ID of the message processing unit is added to the online list.<br><br><br>
Figure 18 is a diagram showing a second flow chart for configuring the ringing tone and<br>
the ring back tone according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 18,<br>
in the present embodiment, the process for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone<br>
includes the following steps:<br>
Step 901: The user terminal configures the ringing tone according to the operation of the<br>
user. For example, the user terminal configures the ringing tone to be the ringing tone for a<br>
corresponding contact user in the address book.<br>
Before Step 901, the user terminal may download the corresponding ringing tone by<br>
interacting with the ringing tone download server. If the corresponding ringing tone is already<br>
stored in the user terminal, the user terminal may operate the ringing tone according to the<br>
operation of the user directly.<br>
Step 902: According to the operation of the user, the user terminal sends a ring back tone<br>
configuration request to the WAP gateway, for requesting the ring back tone platform to<br>
configure the ring back tone in accordance with the result of the ringing tone configuration. The<br>
ring back tone configuration request carries at least the file name of the ringing tone configured<br>
by the user terminal.<br>
Before sending the ring back tone configuration request to the WAP gateway, the user<br>
terminal may first prompt an operation interface to the user to ask whether the user wants to<br>
configure the ring back tone. If the confirmation operation of the user is received, Step 706 is<br>
executed; otherwise, the present flow ends directly, i.e. no operation is performed.<br>
Step 903-Step 904: After receiving the ring back tone configuration request, the WAP<br>
gateway .sends the ring back tone configuration request to the ringing tone download server. The<br>
ringing tone download server sends the ring back tone configuration request to the ring back tone<br>
platform after receiving the ring back tone configuration request.<br>
Step 905: After receiving the ring back tone configuration request, the ring back tone<br>
platform configures the ring back tone of the user terminal according to this ring back tone<br>
configuration request.<br>
The ring back tone platform extracts the file name of the ringing tone from the ringing<br>
tone configuration request, and then searches the ring back tone data base for the ring back tone<br><br><br>
whose name is the same as that of this ringing tone. The ring back tone platform classifies the<br>
relevant information of this ring back tone into the ring back tone pool of the user terminal. After<br>
that, the ring back tone configuration may be performed according to the method as described in<br>
the conventional art.<br>
Alternatively, after extracting the file name of the ringing tone from the ringing tone<br>
configuration request, when the ring back tone platform determines that no relevant information<br>
of the ring back tone, whose name is the same as that of this ringing tone, exists in the ring back<br>
tone pool of the user terminal, the ring back tone platform searches the ring back tone data base<br>
for the ringing tone whose name is the same as that of the ringing tone. After that, the ring back<br>
tone configuration may be performed according to the method as described in the conventional<br>
art.<br>
Step 906: When the ring back tone configuration is finished, the ring back tone platform<br>
sends the result of the ring back tone configuration to the ringing tone download server.<br>
Step 907: After receiving the result of the ring back tone configuration, the ringing tone<br>
download server inquires of the WAP gateway about the ID of the message processing unit of the<br>
user terminal contained in the online list, and determines whether the message processing unit of<br>
the user terminal corresponding to the user information is online. If yes, Step 908 is executed;<br>
otherwise, the ringing tone information is buffered in the message queue. When it is determined<br>
that the message processing unit of the user terminal is online, Step 908 is executed. The method<br>
used by the ringing tone download server to learn that the message processing unit of the<br>
corresponding user terminal is online includes: inquiring of the WAP gateway periodically about<br>
the online list, or requesting the WAP gateway to send a notification to the ringing tone download<br>
server when the message processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is online.<br>
Step 908: The ringing tone download server provides the PPG with the result of the ring<br>
back tone configuration.<br>
Step 909: After receiving the result of the ring back tone configuration, the PPG<br>
constructs a Push message according to the result of the ring back tone configuration, and then<br>
sends the Push message containing the result of the ring back tone configuration to the user<br>
terminal.<br><br><br>
It is also possible to substitute the following steps for the aforementioned Step 902 to Step<br>
904, i.e. the user terminal may also report the result of the ringing tone configuration via a short<br>
message. The specific steps are as follows: the user terminal sends the result of the ringing tone<br>
configuration to the Short Message Center; and the Short Message Center sends the configuration<br>
result to the ring back tone platform.<br>
It is also possible to substitute the following steps for the aforementioned Step 902 to Step<br>
904, i.e. the user terminal may also report the result of the ringing tone configuration via a SIP<br>
message. The specific steps are as follows: the user terminal sends a SIP message to the ring back<br>
tone platform, and the SIP message carries the result of the ringing tone configuration.<br>
Figure 19 is a diagram showing a third flow chart for configuring the ringing tone and the<br>
ring back tone according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 19, in the<br>
present embodiment, the process for configuring the ringing tone and the ring back tone includes<br>
the following steps:<br>
Step A01: The user terminal configures the ringing tone according to the operation of the<br>
user. For example, the user terminal configures the ringing tone to be the ringing tone for a<br>
corresponding contact user in the address book.<br>
Before Step A01, the user terminal may download the corresponding ringing tone by<br>
interacting with the ringing tone download server. If the corresponding ringing tone is already<br>
stored in the user terminal, the user terminal may operate the ringing tone according to the<br>
operation of the user directly.<br>
Step A02: According to the operation of the user, the user terminal sends a ring back tone<br>
configuration request to the WAP gateway, for requesting the ring back tone platform to<br>
configure the ring back tone in accordance with the result of the ringing tone configuration.<br>
Before sending the ring back tone configuration request to the WAP gateway, the user<br>
terminal may first prompt an operation interface to the user to ask whether the user wants to<br>
configure the ring back tone. If the confirmation operation of the user is received, Step 706 is<br>
executed; otherwise, the present flow ends directly, i.e. no operation is performed.<br>
Step A03-Step A04: After receiving the ring back tone configuration request, the WAP<br>
gateway sends the ring back tone configuration request to the WEB server. The WEB server<br><br><br>
sends the ring back tone configuration request to the ring back tone platform after receiving the<br>
ring back tone configuration request.<br>
Step A05: After receiving the ring back tone configuration request, the ring back tone<br>
platform configures the ring back tone of the user terminal according to this ring back tone<br>
configuration request.<br>
Step A06: When the ring back tone configuration is finished, the ring back tone platform<br>
sends the result of the ring back tone configuration to the ringing tone download server.<br>
Step A07: After receiving the result of the ring back tone configuration, the ringing tone<br>
download server inquires of the WAP gateway about the ID of the message processing unit of the<br>
user terminal contained in the online list, and determines whether the message processing unit of<br>
the user terminal corresponding to the user information is online. If yes, the process proceeds to<br>
Step A08; otherwise, the ringing tone information is buffered in the message queue. When it is<br>
determined that the message processing unit of the user terminal is online, the process proceeds<br>
to Step A08. The method used by the ringing tone download server to learn that the message<br>
processing unit of the corresponding user terminal is online includes: inquiring of the WAP<br>
gateway periodically about the online list, or requesting the WAP gateway to send a notification<br>
to the ringing tone download server when the message processing unit of the corresponding user<br>
terminal is online.<br>
Step A08: The ringing tone download server provides the PPG with the result of the ring<br>
back tone configuration.<br>
Step A09: After receiving the result of the ring back tone configuration, the PPG<br>
constructs a Push message according to the result of the ring back tone configuration, and then<br>
sends the Push message containing the result of the ring back tone configuration to the user<br>
terminal.<br>
The structure of the user terminal provided by the embodiments of the present invention<br>
is as shown in Figure 20. It can be seen from the above description that the user terminal may<br>
include: a receiving unit and a ringing tone configuring unit. The receiving unit is adapted to<br>
receive the ringing tone sent by the ringing tone download server according to the result of the<br>
ring back tone configuration, and the ringing tone configuring unit is adapted to configure the<br><br><br>
received ringing tone to be the ringing tone. Alternatively, the user terminal may include a ring<br>
back tone configuring unit, adapted to configure the ringing tone, and request the ring back tone<br>
platform to configure the ring back tone of the user terminal according to the result of the ringing<br>
tone configuration. Alternatively, the user terminal may include the combination of the two above<br>
described structures. The user terminal may further include a message processing unit, adapted to<br>
send the online message when the message processing unit is turned on, and send the offline<br>
message when the message processing unit is turned off. The online message or the offline<br>
message carries the ID of the message processing unit.<br>
The architecture of the ring back tone platform provided by the embodiments of the<br>
invention is as shown in Figure 21. The ring back tone platform includes a notifying unit, adapted<br>
to notify the ringing tone download server of the result of the ring back tone configuration after<br>
the ring back tone configuration is completed. Alternatively, the ring back tone platform may<br>
include a receiving unit and a configuring unit. The receiving unit is adapted to receive the result<br>
of the ringing tone configuration from the ringing tone download server or the WEB server; the<br>
configuring unit is adapted to configure the ring back tone of the user terminal according to the<br>
result of the ringing tone configuration. Alternatively, the ring back tone platform may include<br>
the combination of the above described structures.<br>
The ringing tone download server provided by the embodiments of the present invention<br>
is as shown in Figure 22. The ringing tone download server includes: a requesting unit, adapted<br>
to send the ring back tone configuration request from the user terminal to the ring back tone<br>
platform. Alternatively, the ringing tone download server may include: a file providing unit,<br>
adapted to provide, according to the notification from the ring back tone platform, the user<br>
terminal with the ringing tone corresponding to the result of the ring back tone configuration.<br>
Alternatively, the ringing tone download server may include the combination of the above<br>
described structures. The ringing tone download server may further include an inquiring unit,<br>
adapted to inquiring about the online list maintained by the WAP gateway, and determine<br>
whether he message processing unit of the user terminal is online. The inquiring unit may further<br>
include a sending unit, adapted to send a notification to a message buffering unit further included<br>
in the ringing tone download server, when it is determined that the message processing unit of the<br><br><br>
user terminal is offline. The message buffering unit is adapted to buffer the result of the ring back<br>
tone configuration according to the received notification.<br>
In the solution provided by the embodiments of the present invention, the downloading<br>
and configuring of the ringing tone may be triggered by the ring back tone configuration, or the<br>
configuring of the ring back tone may be triggered by the ringing tone configuration, so that<br>
relevance exists between the ring back tone configuration and the ringing tone configuration.<br>
When a user wants to configure the ringing tone and the ring back tone, which are the same, for a<br>
contact user or a contact group, it is not required to initiate and perform configuration separately<br>
as in the conventional art. With the cooperation between the user terminal and the network<br>
elements, the configuration of the ringing tone and the ring back tone may be accomplished<br>
simultaneously, which facilitates the usage for the user, increases the satisfaction of the user for<br>
the service, and is beneficial for the popularization and application of the ring back tone service<br>
and the ringing tone download service.<br>
Further, when it is required to send the Push message to the user terminal via the PPG, an<br>
online list of the message processing unit of each user terminal is maintained in the WAP gateway.<br>
When the ringing tone download server determines that the message processing unit of the user<br>
terminal is online, the PPG is instructed to construct the Push message, so as to avoid the<br>
situation that the user terminal cannot receive the Push message because the message processing<br>
unit is turned off, and the relevant processing fails.<br>
The solutions provided by the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the<br>
communication network. Instead, they may be suitable for the mobile communication network,<br>
or may be suitable for the fixed communication network.<br>
To sum up, in the solutions provided by the embodiments of the invention, the relevant<br>
data of the ringing tone corresponding to the configured ring back tone is determined via the ring<br>
back tone platform, and dispatched to the user terminal. The user terminal obtains the ringing<br>
tone according to the relevant data. Thus, the ring back tone is converted into the ringing tone.<br>
Further, the solutions in the embodiments of the invention provide a method of<br>
dispatching the relevant data via the DMS, and a method of dispatching the relevant data via the<br>
ringing tone download server.<br><br><br>
Further, in the solutions provided by the embodiments of the invention, after the user<br>
terminal obtains the corresponding ringing tone, the ringing tone may be adapted to be the active<br>
ringing tone of the user terminal according to the instruction on the network side - control MO or<br>
calling signaling, or may be configured manually by the user to be the active ringing tone of the<br>
user terminal, so that the synchronization between the ringing tone and the ring back tone may be<br>
realized for the same user terminal. Thus, the calling party and the called party may hear the same<br>
ringtone, and better service experiences may be achieved.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention, when the ringing tone configuration is accomplished<br>
via the user terminal, the result of the ringing tone configuration is reported to the ring back tone<br>
platform. The ring back tone platform classifies the ring back tone corresponding to the ringing<br>
tone into the ring back tone pool of this user terminal according to the result of the ringing tone<br>
configuration. Thus the ringing tone is converted into the ring back tone.<br>
Further, in the embodiments of the invention, after the ring back tone platform classifies<br>
the ring back tone corresponding to the ringing tone into the ring back tone pool of the user<br>
terminal, this ring back tone may also be configured to be the active ring back tone of this user<br>
terminal, so that the synchronization between the ringing tone and the ring back tone may be<br>
realized for the same user terminal. Thus, the calling party and the called party may hear the same<br>
ringtone, and better service experiences may be achieved.<br>
It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments, particularly, any<br>
preferred embodiments, are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a<br>
clear understanding of the principles of the invention. Many variations and modifications may be<br>
