FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a roof supporting system for mines and the like. More particularly this invention relates to a roof supporting system for mines, providing a better substitute of wooden cross bars presently used for roof support for mines, is much 5 stronger bearing higher blasting load, is long lasting, can be instanty installed without needing any operation like cutting, wielding etc. which are prohibited inside the mines and is reusable without any wastage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10 At present mine roof is supported by means of wooden cross bars for preventing mines from collapsing during blasts. It has been found that wooden strong bars are not so strong enough when considered per unit cross sectional area, wooden cross bar are more bulky creating hindrance in smooth movement of mining machinery, these are heavy, thereby increasing the handling and transportation cost, some operation like cutting is<br>
15 required for adjusting the wooden cross bar inside the bay of mines which is time and labour consuming job and once a wooden cross bar is cut to suit a particular place it cannot be reused at another place and hence these wooden cross bars are non-adjustable and results into huge wastage, moreover wooden cross bars are not long lasting, these are damaged in a short duration, thereby requiring a large number of<br>
20 timber blocks creating an environmental problem. Further wood has now become a scare commodity and there is an urgent need to find out a substitute for wooden cross bars.<br>
Some steel sections have been tried in place of wooden cross bars. Though they are 25 strong enough to take blasting load and also long lasting. But these section are quite heavy, require operations like cutting and welding etc. which cannot be carried out inside the mines due to the presence of inflammable gases and hence are fabricated outside the mines and transported inside making the operation laborious and time consuming, further there is no flexibility or adjustability hence a particular section cannot be reused at any 30    other place, thereby causing wastage.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate all the above mentioned drawbacks of the<br>
2<br><br>
existing roof supporting system for mines and to provide an adjustable roof supporting system for mines which is long lasting, light in weight, smaller in dimensions (cross section) so that there is no hindrances in the movement of automatic coal cutting and handling machines or any other mining machinery and which is adjustable within no time, 5    without needing any prohibitive operations and which is reusable without any wastage.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an adjustable roof supporting system for<br>
mines which is very easy to mass produce and also is easy to handle and be transport<br>
economically. 10<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an adjustable roof supporting system for<br>
mines which is very convenient and quick to adjust to the desired bay size and can be<br>
installed within a short time and similarly is very ease to dismantle quickly without any<br>
wastage. 15<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is an adjustable roof supporting system for mines, comprising of<br>
the plurality of telescopic cross bars, each of the said telescopic cross bar consisting of an<br>
outer member and inner member slidably fitting in the said outer member, one end of 20    the each member being provided with the plurality of matching holes/slots and an<br>
interconnecting means for removably connecting the two members after adjusting the<br>
length of cross bar as per requirement of the bay, the other free hand of each member of<br>
the cross bar being provided with an end support means for supporting the cross bar at<br>
the both ends. 25<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Although following examples shows the operation of    specific embodiments,  many modifications and variations will readily occur to those skilled in the art, accordingly it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. 5<br>
Referring to fig 1 to 5 the adjustable roof supporting system (1) according to this invention comprises a plurality of telescopic cross bars (2) provided in spaced apart relationship along the bay of mines, each of the telescopic cross bar (2) consist of an outer member (3) and an inner member (4) freely sliding and fitting inside the outer<br>
10 member (3) one end (5) of each member (3 &amp; 4) is provided with a plurality of matching slot/holes (6). The pitches of the machines holes (6) may be fixed or variable, but holes are preferably made simultaneously in both the members so that while adjusting the length every pair of the hole is be in perfect alignment. The other free end (7) of the outer member (3) and free end (8) of inner member (4) are supported in end support<br>
15 means, which can be simple cavity (9) formed in the side wall (10) of the bay of mines or as an alternative a U-clamp or hook (11) fixed into the side walls of the bay of mines. As a further alternative end support means may be an independent vertical support (12) supporting the horizontal cross bar(2) directly from the base of the pit. The vertical support (12) comprises a lower member (13) made of any geometric hollow section,<br>
20 preferably made of steel, in which a wooden piece (14) is inserted from below as per height requirement. A middle member (15) is connected to the lower member (13) preferably be using a plate (16) in between the two members. The middle member is selected to take the desired load. The middle member (15) is also made of square/rectangular/round or any other geometric hollow section preferably made up of<br>
25 steel, and a top member (17) which is preferably a channel of required size, suitable to accommodate free ends of cross bars (2). The top member (17) is fixed to the middle member (15) either directly by welding or it may be made of a swiveling head, fixed to a thick M.S. plate by rivet through hole drilled in a channel and a plate. The cross bar (2) is   also   made   of   closed   hollow   section   of   any   geometry   of   preferably   of<br>
30 square/rectangular/round hollow section preferably made of steel. The outer and inner member (3 &amp; 4) are removably interconnected by using a connecting means such as bolt and nuts (18). The length of a cross bar is adjusted as per requirement according to the width of bay of the mines, by simply sliding the inner member inward or out ward and then the bolt (18) is passed through the matching pair of holes (6) and nut is tightened.<br>
4<br><br>
Alternately the holes (6) may be threaded and screw may be used for connecting the two members. For tightly fixing the roof supporting system with independent vertical support, a wooden peg (19) is inserted below the wooden piece (14).<br>
5 The adjustable roof supporting is easily adjustable and can be fixed in position within a few minutes independent of the width of the bay. It is lighter in weight but more durable, can withstand higher blasting load, can be reused without any wastage, requiring no cutting or welding.<br>
