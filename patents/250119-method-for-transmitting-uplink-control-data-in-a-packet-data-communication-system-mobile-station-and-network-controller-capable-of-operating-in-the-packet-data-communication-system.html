				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to packet data communication systems,<br>
and, in particular, to transmission of control data in a packet data communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data for Global<br>
Evolution (EDGE) protocols for the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)<br>
have introduced a capability of the user data interchange into mobile wireless products.<br>
GPRS, and its superset, EDGE, permit efficient use of radio and network resources when<br>
data transmission characteristics are packet-based, intermittent and non-periodic, possibly<br>
frequent with small transfers of data, for example, less than 500 octets, or possibly<br>
infrequent with large transfers of data, for example, more than several hundred kilobytes.<br>
User applications that may utilize GPRS/EDGE protocols may include Internet browsers,<br>
electronic mail, file transfers, and other applications involving transfers of data.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary GPRS/EDGE communication system<br>
100. Communication system 100 includes multiple Base Station Systems (BSSs) 110,<br>
120 that each provides communication services to a respective coverage area, or cell.<br>
Each BSS 110,120 includes a respective Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 112,122 that is<br>
coupled to a respective Base Station Controller (BSC) 114,124. Each BSS 110, 120 is<br>
coupled to a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 128, which SGSN is further coupled<br>
 to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 130 and, via the GGSN, to an external<br>
network 132. BSSs 110,120, SGSNs 116, 126, and GGSN 130 are collectively referred<br>
to as a communication system network 140. Communication system 100 further includes<br>
an MS 102 that resides in a coverage area, or cell, serviced by a first, source BSS 110 of<br><br>
the multiple BSSs 110, 120. Source BSS 110 provides communication services to MS<br>
102 via an air interface, or wireless communication link, 104 that includes a downlink<br>
and an uplink.<br>
As MS 102 moves around in communication system 100, the MS may experience<br>
deterioration in radio frequency (RF) signal conditions or congestion conditions with<br>
respect to the communication services provided to the MS by source BSS 110. As a<br>
result, the MS 102 may decide to perform a cell reselection. In order to facilitate a<br>
selection of a new cell, such as a cell associated with BSS 120, MS 102 and network 140<br>
may exchange System Information (SI) messages and measurement information related to<br>
the neighboring cells. However, the system provided by the GPRS/EDGE protocols<br>
provides only for a discontinuous exchange of such information. That is, such<br>
information is exchanged in data packets in GPRS/EDGE systems via a Packet<br>
Associated Control Channel (PACCH). The PACCH is a control channel that comprises<br>
blocks of four sequential bursts that are stolen from an associated PDTCH. As a result,<br>
the PACCH exists only as a portion of a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) comprising data<br>
that is being transferred via the PDTCH. When there is no TBF, for example, when a<br>
user of MS 102 is receiving rather than sending, the uplink PACCH goes away.<br>
Originally, GPRS/EDGE communication systems were conceived as means of<br>
generating additional revenues for system operators based on their excess capacity during<br>
 browsers, electronic mail, file transfers and other applications for which best efforts data<br>
transfer are appropriate. At that time, the industry did not anticipate real-time<br>
applications, such as streaming and Push-to-Talk (PTT), making use of GPRS/EDGE as<br>
an underlying wireless transport vehicle. As a result and in order to maintain system<br>
simplicity, no real-time handover procedure is specified for best effort packet data<br>
transfers over GPRS/EDGE. Instead, cell reselection is achieved by allowing MS 102 to<br>
reselect cells as it does in idle mode, which causes the MS to abort its packet transfer on<br>
one cell and completely re-establish the ongoing packet transfer on the new cell. In the<br>
meanwhile, until the packet transfer is re-established on the new cell, all data flows are<br>
put on hold. As a result, a reselection between cells typically interrupts the flow of data<br>
in both directions for 500 milliseconds (ms) to approximately four seconds if the new cell<br><br>
resides in a same Routing Area (RA) as the old cell, feat is, if a target BSS is serviced by<br>
a same SGSN as a source BSS. If the new cell resides in a different RA, that is, if the<br>
target BSS is serviced by a different SGSN that the source BSS, then the impact is<br>
typically 8 seconds.<br>
Current metrics show that in an urban area, cell reselection takes place<br>
approximately two to four times per minute, even with the MS physically stationary. The<br>
lack of a true synchronized handover for a GPRS/EDGE communication system such as<br>
system 100 means that the continuity of both uplink and downlink data is compromised<br>
each time a new cell is reselected, either autonomously or under the control of network<br>
140. For applications such as PTT, this means that during a one-way conversation, when<br>
either a talker or a listener reselects to a new cell, the listener may lose up to eight<br>
seconds of voice information and any associated control information conveyed in<br>
association with the voice information.<br>
To overcome these problems of data flow disruptions during cell reselection, a<br>
true synchronized handover is being considered for the packet domain. However, the<br>
introduction of such a packet domain handover is hindered by the fact that there exists no<br>
equivalent in GPRS/EDGE communication systems to a Slow Associated Control<br>
Channel (SACCH) of circuit-switched communication systems over which handover<br>
measurements, typically pilot signal measurements, may flow during, and between, voice<br>
data transfers comprising a single application session, such as PTT.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that provides for a persistent<br>
flow of control data associated with a packet data traffic channel during, and between,<br>
packet data transfers comprising a single application session in a GPRS communication<br>
system.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for a method and apparatus that provides for a persistent flow<br>
of control data associated with a packet data traffic channel during, and between, packet<br>
data transfers comprising a single application session in a General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS)/Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) communication system, a<br>
communication system comprising a mobile station and a network implements a<br>
persistent packet associated control channel that provides for a continuous exchange of<br>
control information, such as system information (SI) messages and handoff-related<br>
information. The mobile station implements the persistent packet associated control<br>
channel by mapping the persistent packet associated control channel to a packet<br>
associated control channel when a packet associated control channel is available and to a<br>
virtual associated control channel when a packet associated control channel is not<br>
available. The virtual associated control channel allows the mobile station to pass control<br>
information to network in the absence of an uplink Temporary Block Flow (TBF).<br>
Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
transmitting control data in a packet data communication system. The method includes,<br><br>
when a packet associated control channel is available, transmitting the control data via the<br>
packet associated control channel, and when a packet associated control channel is not<br>
available, transmitting the control data via a timeslot allocated for the transmission of the<br>
control data.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a mobile station that<br>
includes at least one memory device and a processor operably coupled to the at least one<br>
memory device. The at least one memory device maintains information concerning a<br>
packet associated control channel and a timeslot allocated for transmission of control data<br>
when the packet associated control channel is not available. The processor conveys the<br>
control data via the packet associated control channel when the packet associated control<br>
channel is available and conveys the control data via the timeslot when the packet<br>
associated control channel is not available.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
transmitting control data in a packet data communication system. The method includes<br>
receiving a request for a persistent, packet associated control channel and, in response to<br>
receiving the request, conveying an allocation of a timeslot for use in transmitting the<br>
control data when a packet associated control channel is not available<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a network<br>
controller that includes a processor that receives a request for a persistent, packet<br>
associated control channel and, in response to receiving the request, conveys an allocation<br>
of a timeslot for use in transmitting control data when a packet associated control channel<br>
is not available,<br>
The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 2-6.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 200 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 200 includes multiple<br>
Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) 230, 240 (two shown). Each BTS 230, 240 is operably<br>
coupled to a network controller 232, 242. Each network controller 232, 242 may<br>
comprise one or more of a Base Station Controller (BSC), a Packet Control Unit (PCU),<br>
and a Packet Control Function (PCF) and the functions of the network controller may be<br>
implemented in any one of such elements or may be distributed among such elements. In<br><br>
other embodiments of the present invention, each BTS 230, 240 may be coupled to a<br>
same network controller, or may share some elements of a network controller, such as a<br>
PCU, and may be separately coupled to other elements of a network controller, such as<br>
BSCs. Each BTS 230, 240 provides wireless communication services to mobile stations<br>
(MSs) located in a respective coverage area, or cell, 210,220 associated with the BTS.<br>
Communication system 200 further includes at least one mobile station (MS) 202<br>
that is provided communication services by a source BTS, that is, BTS 230, that services<br>
a cell 210 in which the MS resides. MS 202 and BTS 230 communicate via an air<br>
interface 212 comprising a downlink 214 and an uplink 216. Downlink 214 comprises<br>
multiple logical channels, including at least one broadcast channel, at least one traffic<br>
channel, and at least one control channel. Uplink 216 also comprises multiple logical<br>
channels, including an access channel, at least one traffic channel, and at least one control<br>
channel.<br>
Communication system 200 further includes a Support Node 250 coupled to each<br>
network controller 232, 242. Support Node 250 typically includes one or more Serving<br>
GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs) that are each coupled to one or more Gateway GPRS<br>
Support Nodes (GGSNs). However, the precise architecture of Support Node 250 is up to<br>
an operator of communication system 200 and is not critical to the present invention.<br>
Together, the multiple BTSs 230, 240, the multiple network controllers 232, 242, and<br>
Support Node 250 are collectively referred to herein as a communication system network<br>
252.<br>
Each of MS 202 and controllers 232 and 242 includes a respective processor 204,<br>
234,244 that is operably coupled to, or associated with, a respective at least one memory<br>
device 206, 236, 246. Each of processors 204, 234, and 244 comprises one or more<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof<br>
or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Each of the at least<br>
one memory devices 206, 236, and 246 comprises at least one memory device such as a<br>
random access memory (RAM), a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or a<br>
read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that maintains data and programs that<br>
may be executed by the corresponding processor. MS 202 further includes multiple<br><br>
timers 208, 209 associated with processor 204, and each of controllers 232 and 242<br>
further includes a respective timer 238, 248 associated with a respective processor 234,<br>
244.<br>
Communication system 200 comprises a wireless packet data communication<br>
system. In order for MS 202 to establish a packet data connection with an external<br>
network such as external network 254, each of MS 202, the multiple BTSs 230, 240, the<br>
multiple network controllers 232, 242, and support node 250 operates in accordance with<br>
the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data for Global Evolution<br>
(EDGE) communication system standards, and in particular with 3 GPP (Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) TS (Technical Specification) 23.060 v5.0.0, 3GPP TS 44.060 V4.4.0,<br>
3GPP TS 45.002 v5.3.0, 3GPP TS 45.008 v5.4.0, 3GPP TS 04.18 v8.12.0, which<br>
standards are hereby incorporated by reference herein and copies of which may be<br>
obtained from the 3GPP via the Internet or from the 3GPP Organization Partners'<br>
Publications Offices at Mobile Competence Centre 650, route des Lucioles, 06921<br>
Sophia-Antipolis Cedex, France. The GPRS and EDGE standards specify wireless<br>
telecommunications system operating protocols, including radio system parameters and<br>
call processing and handoff procedures, for GPRS and EDGE communication systems.<br>
By operating in accordance with the GPRS and EDGE standards, a user of MS 202 can be<br>
assured that MS 202 will be able to communicate with network 252 and establish a<br>
packet data communication link with an external network 254 via network 252.<br>
GPRS communication systems, such as communication system 200, use a<br>
combination of frequency and time division multiplexing to define a physical channel,<br>
with the result that a physical channel is defined as a sequence of radio frequency<br>
channels and timeslots. The physical channel comprises multiple logical channels,<br>
wherein each logical channel comprises a portion of the physical channel, such as a<br>
portion of a timeslot, a timeslot, or multiple timeslots, that is allocated for conveyance of<br>
control or traffic data. Typically, a radio frequency channel comprises eight time slots,<br>
which eight time slots constitute a frame. Each timeslot within a frame is numbered with<br>
a timeslot number (TN), typically in a range from 0 to 7, and each frame is numbered by a<br>
frame number (FN), typically in a range from 0 to 2,715,647. In addition, a 52-<br>
mulitframe, comprising 52 frames, is typically used to support packet data traffic and<br><br>
associated control channels and a 51-multiframe, comprising 51 frames, is typically used<br>
to support broadcast and common control channels.<br>
When MS 202 is actively engaged in a packet data communication session, the<br>
MS conveys data packets to, and receives data packets from, serving BTS 230. In<br>
addition, MS 202 maintains in the at least one memory device 206 of the MS a Neighbor<br>
List comprising logical channels associated with neighboring BTSs, such as BTS 240,<br>
that are potential handoff or reselection candidates for MS 202. Typically, the Neighbor<br>
List comprises a list of broadcast channels (BCCH) associated with each of multiple cells<br>
of the neighboring BTSs, such as a broadcast channel associated with BTS 240<br>
In order to determine whether to engage in a cell reselection, MS 202 monitors<br>
each broadcast channel identified in the Neighbor List. MS 202 determines a signal<br>
quality metric, such as a signal strength, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or a bit error rate<br>
(BER), with respect to each monitored signal and further with respect to signals received<br>
from serving BTS 230. Based on the determined signal quality metrics, MS 202<br>
determines whether to initiate a cell reselection. For example, MS 202 may compare<br>
each determined signal quality metric to a signal quality metric threshold that is<br>
maintained in the at least one memory device 206 of the MS. When a signal quality<br>
metric determined with respect to serving BTS 230 compares unfavorably, with the signal<br>
quality metric threshold, for example, is less than the threshold, and a signal quality<br>
metric determined with respect to a neighboring BTS, that is, BTS 240, compares<br>
favorably with the signal quality metric threshold, for example, exceeds the threshold,<br>
then MS 202 may determine to initiate a cell reselection to the neighboring cell 220<br>
serviced by BTS 240.<br>
In order to facilitate a real-time handover of MS 202 from cell 210 to cell 220 and<br>
to further facilitate a continuous exchange of system information and handoff-related<br>
information between the MS and network 252 so that a handoff may occur at an<br>
appropriate moment rather than, as in the prior art, only at discrete moments when such<br>
information may be exchanged, communication system 200 provides a continuous, uplink<br>
control channel that provides for a continuous exchange of control information, such as<br>
system information (SI) messages and handoff-related information, related to a packet<br><br>
data traffic channel that is concurrently utilized by the MS for an exchange of data<br>
packets comprising user information.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a Packet Data Channel (PDCH) 300 that comprises a<br>
continuous, persistent packet data control channel 302, that is, a Persistent Packet<br>
Associated Control Channel (PPACCH), in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. PPACCH 302 is associated with a Packet Data Traffic Channel<br>
(PDTCH) 306 that is utilized by MS 202 during an application session, such as a PTT<br>
session. When MS 102 is actively engaged in an application session, the MS conveys<br>
user information, such as voice data, to network 252 via a Packet Data Traffic Channel<br>
(PDTCH) 306. PDTCH 306 comprises a portion of each of multiple discrete Temporary<br>
Block Flows (TBFs) 304 (three shown). Each TBF 304 further includes a Packet<br>
Associated Control Channel (PACCH) 308. PACCH 308 comprises a control channel<br>
that comprises blocks of four sequential bursts that are stolen from an associated PDTCH<br>
306 and that is used by MS 202 and network 252 to exchange System Information (SI)<br>
messages and measurement information related to the associated PDTCH. As shown in<br>
FIG. 3, since PACCH 308 exists only as a portion of a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) 304<br>
comprising voice data that is being transferred via PDTCH 306, when no voice is being<br>
transferred and there is no TBF there is no PACCH. For example, when a user of MS<br>
202 is listening rather than speaking, PACCH 308 goes away.<br>
In order to provide a continuous uplink control channel that provides for a<br>
continuous exchange of control information, such as system information (SI) messages<br>
and handoff-related information, communication system 200 provides a Persistent<br>
PACCH (PPACCH) 302 that maps to PACCH 308 when the PACCH is available and to<br>
a Packet Virtual Associated Control Channel (P-VACCH, or VACCH) 310 when<br>
PACCH 308 is not available. As shown in FIG. 3, PPACCH 302 persists over the course<br>
of the application session, even in the absence of an uplink TBF 304. That is, PPACCH<br>
is a logical channel that is carried by PACCH 308 when the PACCH is active and by<br>
VACCH 310 when PACCH is not available, such as between uplink TBFs 304. VACCH<br>
310 is an uplink channel assignment that is used for control purposes and that allows an<br>
MS, such as MS 202, without an uplink TBF to pass information to network 252.<br>
V<br><br>
such RLC/MAC blocks have been transmitted and, in acknowledged mode, successfully<br>
acknowledged.<br>
RLC/MAC function 404 provides for transport of multiple logical channels. On<br>
network 252 side of communication system 200, the multiple logical channels originate<br>
(in the case of downlink channels) and terminate (in the case of uplink channels) in<br>
controller 232, and in particular in processor 234 of controller 232. The logical channels<br>
are multiplexed by a multiplexing function 420 included in the RLC/MAC function and<br>
transferred over a Packet Data Channel (PDCH) 422, that is, a physical channel allocated<br>
to carry the above logical channels. A first logical channel 406 of the multiple logical<br>
channels comprises a Packet Common Control Channel (PCCCH) that provides, on the<br>
downlink, for a paging of MS 202 or to notify the MS of a call, on the uplink to request<br>
an allocation of a traffic channel, that is, a Packet Data Traffic Channel (PDTCH), and<br>
again on the downlink to notify MS 202 of the allocated channel. A second logical<br>
channel 408 of the multiple logical channels comprises a Packet Broadcast Control<br>
Channel (PBCCH) that is used to broadcast parameters used by MS 202 to access<br>
network 252 for packet transmission operation. A third logical channel 306 of the<br>
multiple logical channels comprises the PDTCH, which channel corresponds to the<br>
communication channel allocated to a single MS for user data transmission. However, as<br>
noted above, the PACCH merely comprises bits stolen from the PDTCH and accordingly<br>
the PACCH information, such as system information and measurement information, can<br>
be transferred only when there is a PDTCH 306. Information concerning the PCCCH,<br>
PBCCH, and PDTCH is maintained in the respective at least one memory devices 206,<br>
236 of MS 202 and controller 232.<br>
A fourth logical channel of the multiple logical channels comprises the PPACCH<br>
302. As noted above, PPACCH is a continuous uplink control channel that provides for a<br>
continuous exchange of control information, such as system information (SI) messages<br>
and handoff-related information. PPACCH logical controller 412, which is implemented<br>
in processor 204 of MS 202, maps PPACCH 302 to a fifth logical channel, that is,<br>
PACCH 308, when the PACCH is available and to a sixth logical channel, that is,<br>
VACCH 310, when PACCH 308 is not available. That is, PPACCH is a logical channel<br>
that is carried by PACCH 308 when the PACCH is active and by VACCH 310 when<br><br>
PPACCH 302 is an uplink control channel that originates at MS 202 and<br>
terminates at a controller serving the MS, that is, controller 232. Referring now to FIG. 4,<br>
PPACCH 302 is implemented on a mobile side of communication system 200 by a<br>
PPACCH logical channel controller 412 that is implemented in processor 204 of MS 202.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an exemplary protocol architecture of a radio interface 400<br>
that implements PPACCH 302 in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Radio interface 400 is implemented in processor 204 of MS 202. On the<br>
network side of communication system 200, a corresponding radio interface is<br>
implemented in serving BTS 230 and associated controller 232 and support node 250.<br>
Radio Interface 400 comprises a Radio Resource (RR) Sublayer 402 that resides<br>
above a Physical Link Layer 430. RR Sublayer 402 comprises a Radio Link Control<br>
(RLC)/Medium Access Control (MAC) function 404 that provides services for the<br>
transfer of Packet Data Units (PDUs) received from upper layers (not shown) and utilizes<br>
the services of Physical Link Layer 430 to transfer the PDUs. The layers and functions<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4 are merely provided for the purpose of illustrating the principles of<br>
the present invention and are not intended to depict a comprehensive architecture of a<br>
radio interface of MS 202 and controller 234, as one of ordinary skill in the art realizes<br>
that a radio interface, such as radio interface 400, may further include other layers, for<br>
example, a Mobility Management (MM) Sublayer, a Logical Link Control (LLC)<br>
Sublayer, and a Data Link Layer.<br>
An RLC function of RLC/MAC function 404 includes segmentation and<br>
reassembly of PDUs into RLC/MAC blocks and for error correction procedures enabling<br>
a retransmission of unsuccessfully delivered blocks. A MAC function of RLC/MAC<br>
function 404 includes functions related to the management of shared communication<br>
resources, such as allowing an MS, such as MS 202, to use several communication<br>
channels in parallel, that is, to use several timeslots within a same TDMA frame. The<br>
MAC function supports the provision of TBFs 304 that provide for point-to-point transfer<br>
of signaling information and user data between network 252 and MS 202. A TBF 304 is<br>
used by network 252 and MS 202 to support a uni-directional transfer of Packet Data<br>
Units (PDUs) and comprises multiple RLC/MAC blocks carrying one or more upper layer<br>
PDUs. As illustrated by FIG. 3, a TBF 304 is temporary and is maintained only until all<br><br>
PACCH is not available.<br>
FIG. 5 is a signal flow diagram 500 illustrating a method for implementing<br>
PPACCH 302 in communication system 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 5, network 252 implements a<br>
PPACCH 302 that comprises a fixed allocation of an uplink channel having implicit time<br>
division multiple access (TDMA) frame numbers on which MS 202 has the right to<br>
transmit. Signal flow diagram 500 begins when MS 202 transmits (502) a request for a<br>
PPACCH to network 252 and starts (504) a first MS PPACCH, TPATCH_MS_1, 208. First MS<br>
PPACCH timer 208 counts down a first time period during which MS 202 may transmit<br>
measurements to network 252 and is intended to prevent an inactive MS from endlessly<br>
transmitting measurements. Upon expiration of first MS PPACCH timer 208, MS 202<br>
ceases transmitting measurements to network 252. However, MS 202 may, at any time,<br>
refresh, that is, restart, first MS PPACCH timer 208. For example, when MS 202 realizes<br>
that first MS PPACCH timer 208 has expired or is about to expire and the MS has further<br>
PPACCH data to transmit via PPACCH 302, the MS may refresh or restart first MS<br>
PPACCH timer 208. The duration of first time period is up to a designer of<br>
communication system 200 is not critical to the present invention. Unless otherwise<br>
specified herein, functions performed by MS 202 and controller 232 are respectively<br>
performed by processor 204 of the MS and processor 234 of the controller. In addition,<br>
unless otherwise specified herein, functions performed by network 252 are performed by<br>
a serving controller 232, and in particular by a processor 234 of the serving controller.<br>
In response to receiving the request, network 252, and in particular controller 232<br>
of network 252, grants (506) an allocation of a PPACCH 302 to the MS. However, in<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, network 252 may allocate PPACCH 302 to<br>
MS 202 on its own initiative, without first receiving a request from the MS (that is,<br>
absent step 502). The allocation of PPACCH 302 comprises an allocation of PPACCH<br>
parameters, which parameters define a VACCH 310 on which MS 202 has a right to<br>
transmit. The PPACCH parameters include a starting Absolute Frame Number (AFN(s))<br>
corresponding to a first VACCH 310 on which MS 202 has a right to transmit, an<br>
Allocation Divisor 'M' which controls when the MS has the right to transmit, and an<br>
/<br><br>
uplink timeslot allocation (0 - 7) to which VACCH 310 is assigned. Network 252 then<br>
conveys (508) the PPACCH parameters to MS 202.<br>
In response to receiving the PPACCH parameters, MS 202 stores the PPACCH<br>
parameters in the at least one memory device 206 of the MS. MS 202, and in particular<br>
PPACCH logical controller 412, further determines (510) whether a PACCH 308 is<br>
available for use as a PPACCH 302, that is, whether the PPACCH may be mapped to an<br>
available PACCH.<br>
When MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines<br>
(510) that a PACCH 308 is not available, for example, when no TBF is available for a<br>
transmission of a first block of PPACCH data due to an absence of voice data for<br>
transmission, the PPACCH logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to VACCH 310. MS<br>
202 further holds off transmitting until a time corresponding to the starting Absolute<br>
Frame Number, AFN(s) and then transmits the first block of PPACCH data via the<br>
VACCH. That is, when a PACCH 308 is not available, MS 202 transmits (512) the<br>
PPACCH data over PPACCH 302 by use of VACCH 310, which VACCH corresponds to<br>
an allocated timeslot 'NOT (AFN(s) mod M)' of a frame beginning at frame number<br>
AFN(s). Also, MS 202 starts (514) a second MS PPACCH timer, TPATCH_MS_1, 209. When<br>
network 252 receives the PPACCH data from MS 202 via VACCH 310, that is, in the<br>
allocated timeslot, the network starts (516) a network PPACCH timer, TPATCH_NETWORK, 238.<br>
When MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines<br>
(510) that a PACCH 308 is available for transmission of the PPACCH data, the PPACCH<br>
logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to the available PACCH 308 and MS 202 transmits<br>
(518) the PPACCH data via the PACCH. In this manner, network 252 establishes a<br>
VACCH 310 and MS 202 and network 252 implement a PPACCH 302 by use of a<br>
PACCH 308 when available and the established VACCH 310 when a PACCH is not<br>
available.<br>
Each block of PPACCH data that MS 202 is required to transmit may then be<br>
transmitted by repeating the above procedure. For example, with respect to a second<br>
block of PPACCH data, MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, again<br>
determines (520) whether a PACCH 308 is available for use as a PPACCH 302. When<br><br>
MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines (520) that a<br>
PACCH 308 is not available, the PPACCH logical controller again maps the PPACCH<br>
302 to VACCH 310 and MS 202 transmits (522) the second block of PPACCH data over<br>
PPACCH 302 on VACCH 310, that is, in an allocated timeslot at 'NOT (AFN mod M).'<br>
MS 202 also re-starts (524) second MS PPACCH timer 209. When network 252 receives<br>
the second block of PPACCH data from MS 202 on VACCH 310 in the allocated<br>
timeslot, the network re-starts (526) network PPACCH timer 238. When MS 202, and in<br>
particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines (520) that a PACCH 308 is<br>
available, then the PPACCH logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to the available<br>
PACCH 308 and MS 202 transmits the second block of PPACCH data over PPACCH<br>
302 on the PPACCH.<br>
When MS 202 has no further PPACCH data for transmission via PPACCH 302,<br>
then MS 202 holds off transmitting (528) on VACCH 310 for a time period equal to or<br>
greater than the second MS PPACCH timer 209. Second MS PPACCH timer 209 and<br>
network PPACCH timer 238 are respectively used by MS 202 and network 252 to<br>
determine a time period until termination of an allocation of resources for PPACCH 302.<br>
The time periods measured by each of second MS PPACCH timer 209 and network<br>
PPACCH timer 238 are up to a designer of communication system 200 and are not<br>
critical to the present invention. When MS 202 determines (530) that second MS<br>
PPACCH timer 209 has expired, the MS realizes that it can no longer transmit on<br>
PPACCH 302. When network 252 determines (532) that network PPACCH timer 238 has<br>
expired, the network realizes that it can re-allocate the resources, that is, the PACCH and<br>
VACCH, allocated to MS 202 for transmission of PPACCH data.<br>
The implementation of the PPACCH described with respect to FIG. 5 provides an<br>
advantage that the Divisor 'M' may be set by network 252 to offer a certain data rate. In<br>
addition, network 252 has a priori knowledge of MS 202's assignment, enabling a simple<br>
algorithm for sharing the uplink timeslot with other MSs in communication system 200<br>
for use by best effort packet data transfer services. It is also possible to share the uplink<br>
timeslot with other MSs and provide PPACCH service using the VACCH for each of<br>
multiple MSs. The value of 'M' then sets the maximum number of MSs that may share<br><br>
the timeslot, wherein the VACCH assigned to each of the multiple MSs is separately<br>
defined by varying an AJFN(s) for each MS allocation.<br>
A disadvantage of the PPACCH service illustrated in FIG. 5 is that the allocation<br>
of the VACCH requires signaling not currently defined by the GPRS standards and the<br>
service provides a fixed allocation of the VACCH, that is, the VACCH may not be<br>
changed by network 252 without additional signaling. As a result, in another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, VACCH 310 may be dynamically controlled by<br>
network 252 by use of an existing Uplink State Flag (USF) mechanism. Such an<br>
embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 6, which depicts a signal flow diagram 600 of a method<br>
for implementing a PPACCH 302 by communication system 200 by use of a USF.<br>
Signal flow diagram 600 begins when MS 202 transmits (602) a request for a<br>
PPACCH to network 252 and starts (604) first MS PPACCH timer 208. Similar to signal<br>
flow diagram 500, upon expiration of first MS PPACCH timer 208 MS 202 ceases<br>
transmitting measurements to network 252. However, MS 202 may, at any time, refresh<br>
or restart first MS PPACCH timer 208. In response to receiving the request, network<br>
252, and in particular network controller 232 of network 252, (606) grants an allocation<br>
of a PPACCH 302 to MS 202. However, in another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, network 252 may allocate PPACCH 302 to MS 202 on its own initiative,<br>
without first receiving a request from the MS (that is, absent step 602). Similar to signal<br>
flow diagram 500, the allocation of PPACCH 302 comprises an allocation of PPACCH<br>
parameters, which parameters define a VACCH 310 on which MS 202 has a right to<br>
transmit. However, unlike signal flow diagram 500, the PPACCH parameters comprise<br>
an MS Uplink State Flag (USF) assignment and an uplink timeslot allocation (0 - 7) to<br>
which VACCH 310 is assigned. Network 252 then conveys (608) the PPACCH<br>
parameters to MS 202 and the MS 202 stores the PPACCH parameters in the at least one<br>
memory device 206 of the MS.<br>
Network 252 then controls access to the PPACCH by use of the USF. When<br>
network 252 determines that MS 202 may access the PPACCH, the network conveys the<br>
assigned USF to MS 202. While awaiting the USF, MS 202 queues the PPACCH data.<br>
MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines (610) whether a<br><br>
PACCH 308 is available for use as a PPACCH 302, that is, whether the PPACCH may be<br>
mapped to an available PACCH. When PPACCH logical controller 412 determines (610)<br>
that a PACCH 308 is not available, for example, when no TBF is available for a<br>
transmission of PPACCH data due to an absence of voice data for transmission, the<br>
PPACCH logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to VACCH 310 and, in response to<br>
receiving the USF, MS 202 transmits a first block of PPACCH data via the VACCH.<br>
That is, when a PACCH 308 is not available, MS 202 transmits (612) the PPACCH data<br>
over PPACCH 302 by use of VACCH 310, which VACCH corresponds to the assigned<br>
timeslot after receiving the MS's USF. MS 202 further starts (614) second MS PPACCH<br>
timer 209. When network 252 receives the first block of PPACCH data on VACCH 310<br>
via the assigned timeslot from MS 202, the network starts (616) network PPACCH timer<br>
238.<br>
When MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical controller 412, determines<br>
(610) that a PACCH 308 is available for transmission of the PPACCH data, the PPACCH<br>
logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to the available PACCH 308 and MS 202 transmits<br>
(618) the PPACCH data via the PACCH. In this manner, network 252 establishes a<br>
VACCH 310, implements, with MS 202, a PPACCH 302 by use of a PACCH 308 when<br>
available and the established VACCH 310 when a PACCH is not available, and<br>
dynamically controls access to the PPACCH.<br>
The above procedure may then be repeated for each transfer of a block of<br>
PPACCH data. For example, with respect to a second block of PPACCH data, MS 202<br>
again waits to receive the assigned USF. MS 202, and in particular PPACCH logical<br>
controller 412, determines (620) whether a PACCH 308 is available for use as a<br>
PPACCH 302. When PPACCH logical controller 412 determines (620) that a PACCH<br>
308 is not available for transmission of the second block of PPACCH data, the PPACCH<br>
logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to VACCH 310 and, in response to receiving the<br>
assigned USF, MS 202 transmits (622) the second block of PPACCH data over PPACCH<br>
302 via VACCH 310 and the assigned timeslot. MS 202 also re-starts (624) second MS<br>
PPACCH timer 209. When network 252 receives the second block of PPACCH data<br>
from MS 202 over VACCH 310 in the assigned timeslot, the network re-starts (626) the<br>
network PPACCH timer 238. When PPACCH logical controller 412 determines that a<br><br>
PACCH 308 is available for transmission of the second block of PPACCH data, the<br>
PPACCH logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to the PACCH and MS 202 transmits the<br>
second block of PPACCH data over PPACCH 302 via the available PACCH 308.<br>
"When MS 202 has no further PPACCH data for transmission via PPACCH 302,<br>
then MS 202 holds off transmitting (628) on the VACCH 310 for a time period equal to<br>
or greater than the second MS PPACCH timer 209. Similar to signal flow diagram 500,<br>
second MS PPACCH timer 209 and network PPACCH timer 238 are respectively used by<br>
MS 202 and network 252 to determine a time period until termination of an allocation of<br>
resources for PPACCH 302. When MS 202 determines (630) that second MS PPACCH<br>
timer 209 has expired, the MS realizes that it can no longer transmit on PPACCH 302.<br>
When network 252 determines (632) that network PPACCH timer 238 has expired, the<br>
network realizes that it can re-allocate the resources, that is, the PACCH and VACCH,<br>
allocated to MS 202 for transmission of PPACCH data.<br>
By using the USF mechanism, network 252 is able to dynamically control access<br>
to the PPACCH 302, that is, is able to dynamically allocate the PPACCH, by use of a<br>
known signal. When MS 202 requests a PPACCH service, network 252 grants MS 202<br>
the right to transmit every 'M' TDMA frames via the USF mechanism. 'M' may be a<br>
fixed period, as in signal flow diagram 500, or may be a variable period having an<br>
average value that would permit adequate transmission of the uplink data from MS 202 to<br>
network 252. MS 202, in response to receiving the acknowledgement of PPACCH setup,<br>
then operates as described above, transmitting PPACCH data sent on the logical<br>
PPACCH channel over a PACCH 308 if the PACCH is available or queueing PPACCH<br>
data for transmission over the VACCH 310 whenever the MS is granted the right to<br>
transmit via the USF mechanism.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, in another embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
logical binding may exist between an RR Sublayer 402 of MS 202 and each of multiple<br>
applications, such as PTT, in an Application Layer (not shown) that resides above the RR<br>
Sublayer 402. As a result, an application running on processor 204 of MS 202 may<br>
selectively request the services of PPACCH logical controller 412.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, MS 202 may decide whether<br>
to activate the PPACCH service based on a general heuristic that would activate the<br>
PPACCH whenever a simplex TBF is established, which service would then persist for a<br>
certain period of time. A pattern recognition function implemented in processor 204 of<br>
MS 202 would recognize an initiation of a simplex downlink TBF based on certain TBF<br>
utilization patterns maintained in the at least one memory device 206 of the MS.<br>
In addition, although FIGs. 5 and 6 describe the PPACCH service as being MS<br>
requestable, the establishment of a PPACCH 302 need not be limited to MS requests. In<br>
yet other embodiments of the present invention, the PPACCH service may be network<br>
requestable or, optionally, always available.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, there may be time periods<br>
during which MS 202 does not have any uplink information to transmit to network 252<br>
prior to PPACCH timers 209 and 238 expiring. In these instances, MS 202 may further<br>
convey a "keep alive" message to the network 252 as long as the MS intends to utilize the<br>
PPACCH.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, MS 202 may be capable of<br>
detecting whether or not the establishment or continuing operation of PPACCH 302 has<br>
failed, in which event MS 202 may return to a quiescent state of inactivity, requiring<br>
subsequent setup. The detection of a failure of the PPACCH may be achieved by<br>
providing periodic acknowledgements and/or other periodic check pointing information<br>
for MS 202 from network 252. However, this should not be a problem for the network<br>
252, since the network may employ the data last received on the PACCH as a checkpoint<br>
from the MS.<br>
By implementing a Persistent PACCH (PPACCH) 302, communication system<br>
200 provides a continuous uplink control channel that provides for a continuous exchange<br>
of control information, such as system information (SI) messages and handoff-related<br>
information. In an MS such as MS 202, PPACCH 302 is implemented by a PPACCH<br>
logical controller 412 that is, in turn, implemented in a processor 204 of the MS, which<br>
logical controller maps PPACCH 302 to PACCH 308 when the PACCH is available and<br>
to a Packet Virtual Associated Control Channel (P-VACCH, or VACCH) 310 when<br><br>
PACCH 308 is not available. That is, PPACCH 302 is a logical channel that is carried by<br>
PACCH 308 when the PACCH is available and by VACCH 310 when PACCH is not<br>
available, such as between uplink TBFs 304. VACCH 310 is an uplink channel<br>
assignment that is used for control purposes and that is defined by PPACCH parameters<br>
conveyed by network 252 to the MS. VACCH 310 allows an MS, such as MS 202,<br>
without an uplink TBF to pass information to network 252. PPACCH 302 persists over<br>
the course of the application session even in the absence of an uplink TBF 304 and<br>
therefore is valuable for applications such as Push-to-Talk (PTT) and may other<br>
applications in the Internet Packet Multimedia domain that require a real-time exchange<br>
of control data<br>
