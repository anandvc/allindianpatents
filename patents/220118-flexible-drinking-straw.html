				<td>FLEXIBLE DRINKING STRAW<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to flexible straws with one (or more) corrugated zone (flexible zone) consisting of re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds), which are attached to the packaging of fruit juices, milks, coffees etc. and are permanently bent until their use in order to take up less space.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The straws used to date for this purpose have one corrugated zone (flexible zone) consisting of 8-10 re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds). [The first (or the last) fold, being firm, is not counted as re-entrant overlapping fold]. To bend to obtuse angles (e.g. 180°) due to the restricted number of folds, continuous external pressure has to be exercised. This pressure keeps being exercised by the packaging material afterwards as well. As a result the folds are permanently deformed and straightening of the straw is not possible. Also a problem is posed by the fact that all folds are expanded (unfolded) after bending of the straw, (e.g. The U-shaped straws.)<br>
The corrugated zone (flexible zone) of the new straw according to present invention, consists of expanded (unfolded) re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows<br><br>
folds) that have not been deformed by force and contracted (folded) re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds) interspersed among the expanded ones so that not many consecutive expanded folds 2, 5 exist without interference of one 3 or more 4 contracted ones in order that we achieve the best possible straightening up of the straw. Further, the first folds 1 are contracted, so that after straightening, the straw may bend to all directions.<br>
The relevant prior art consists of the following documents:<br>
1.	DE - A - 3 242 257 (Hertel Reinhard - 17 May 1984).<br>
The straw that is mentioned in the above document is a different straw with different function (FIG. 18).<br>
It has a zone of expanded folds on the corner 90° portion among two zones of contracted folds, so that the 2 equal "legs" of it can be extended in length prior to use.<br>
Further, the two zones of contracted folds consist of different folds.<br>
2.	GB - A - 1  219 595 (UNION CARBIDE CORP.  - 20<br>
January  1971) &amp; US - A - 3 641   884 (JIVOIN - 15<br>
February 1972).<br>
The above  Letters Patents refer to  properties of the<br><br>
common, plastic, straight, flexible drinking straws of general use.<br>
No mention is made to straws that are attached to the packaging of fruit juices, milks, coffees etc. and are permanently bent until their use. Besides, approximately 28 years have lapsed since then but no one has thought of some of the recommended innovations.<br>
The present invention describes the way we can overcome the problems created by continuous bending of the straws and achieve the best possible straightening up and functionality of them.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that it increases the effective length of the straw and attains complete straightening up and functionality of it without a significant increase in the production cost and without major changes in the current production line.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
FIG. 1 Shows indicatively a straw in bent position, with one corrugated zone having certain folds contracted.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To assist straightening up of the straw, when all its folds are expanded after bending (like the case is until today), the<br><br>
straw must have sufficient folds  (more than ten),  so that when it bends, the folds are not deformed by force.<br>
Further, the straw should not be under any form of external pressure. Therefore the straw, after bending, is let free to remain bent at the desired angle without external pressure. Following this it can be packed in its final form.<br>
If, in any way, more folds are expanded, than those needed to bent the straw to the desired angle, then the extra expanded folds lose their flexibility as the time passes and do not bend to any direction.<br>
To achieve the best possible straightening up and functionality of the straw, even if stored for an extensive period, there have to be sufficient folds so that after bending of the straw, certain folds remain contracted without, of course, deformation of the expanded folds in a forceful way.<br>
We aim at keeping the first folds 1 contracted (e.g. 2-4 first folds) so that after straightening, the straw may bend to all directions thanks to the contracted folds.<br>
Straightening of the straw is considerably assisted by the existence of interspersed contracted folds among the expanded ones, as well as around the middle of the arch formed by bending of the straw, so that not many consecutive expanded folds exist without interference of one 3 or more 4 contracted ones, particularly at the middle of the arch, where<br><br>
the   biggest   amount   of   pressure   is   exercised   [e.g.   an expanded fold 2 is followed by a contracted fold 3].<br>
Certainly the number of contracted folds may vary in the different applications (e.g. in certain packages of juices where the full straightening up of the straw is of no particular interest, we may leave contracted, the first 5-6 folds and only 2-3 interspersed folds, just to secure the expanded folds will not be deformed by force).<br>
In order definite folds remain contracted, apart from their number certain other factors are of importance as well, like the material, point (or points) at which pressure is exerted to bend the straw, the shape and the position of fulcrum (or fulcrums) etc. (e.g. The pressure is applied on a fixed point and the position of the fulcrum changes as the straw bends).<br>
As there exist extra folds, it is difficult for them to be deformed by force. For full-scale application of the recommended changes there have to be sufficient folds (many more than ten folds).<br>
In order the straw is not under any form of external pressure after bending, it is let free to remain bent at the desired angle without external pressure. Following this, it can be packed in its final form.<br>
If something goes wrong in bending and some consecutive folds are expanded 5 or some of the first folds is<br><br>
expanded this is not a serious problem and the straw straightens again (usually without any particular effort), because:<br>
1.	The folds are not deformed by force.<br>
2.	There  will  always  be  enough  contracted  folds  to<br>
support straightening of the expanded ones.<br>
With the presence of the contracted folds after bending of the straw, we can increase its effective length as well, because when it straightens and all folds are expanded, it can bend, if we wish, at the first folds and the remaining section stays straight and larger than respective section of the usual straws.<br>
In case the straw has more than one corrugated zones (flexible zones) consisting of re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds), [e.g. the S-shaped straws - EP-A-0 327 244 (ELOPAK SYSTEMS AG)] the above are applied on all zones.<br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.	The  flexible  drinking   straws  with   one  (or  more)<br>
corrugated   zone   (flexible   zone)   consisting   of   re-entrant<br>
overlapping folds (annular bellows folds), which are attached<br>
to the packaging of fruit juices, milks, coffees etc. and are<br>
permanently bent until their use in  order to take up less<br>
space,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the corrugated zone (flexible zone) of the straw consists of expanded (unfolded) re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds) that have not been deformed by force and contracted (folded) re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds) interspersed among the expanded ones so that not many consecutive expanded folds 2, 5 exist without interference of one 3 or more 4 contracted ones, in order that we achieve the best possible straightening up of the straw.<br>
2.	The flexible drinking straws, which are attached to<br>
the  packaging  of fruit juices,   milks,  coffees etc.   and  are<br>
permanently bent until their use  in  order to take up less<br>
space, according to claim 1<br>
wherein the first re-entrant overlapping folds (annular bellows folds) 1 of the corrugated zone (flexible zone) of the straw are contracted (folded), so that after straightening, the straw may bend to all directions.<br></td>
