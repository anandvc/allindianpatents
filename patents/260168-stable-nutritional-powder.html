COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
"STABLE NUTRITIONAL POWDER"<br>
ABBOTT LABORATORIES, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of State of Illinois, United States of America, having its Registered Office at Dept.377 Bldg AP6A-1, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-6008 (US)<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
STABLE NUTRITIONAL POWDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is directed to nutritional powders having improved oxidative stability and sensory performance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nutritional powders are well known for use in providing various individuals with sole or supplemental nutrition. These powders are reconstituted with water, or other aqueous liquid, by the ultimate user to form a nutritional liquid'.or beverage. These powders most often contain varying amounts and types of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals, all depending largely upon the nutritional needs of the intended user.<br>
Among nutritional formulas commercially available today, infant formulas have become .well known and commonly used in providing a supplemental or sole source of nutrition early in life. Although human milk is generally accepted as a superior nutritional source for infants, many infant nutritional formulas can still provide a quality alternative for those mothers who cannot breastfeed or choose not to under their particular circumstances. These infant formulas typically contain proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.<br>
Nutritional powders, including infant formulas, often contain a variety of ingredients that tend to be more oxidatively sensitive than other ingredients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids require additional care during processing to ensure that the polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, in the finished powder do not excessively degrade by way of oxidation during prolonged storage periods of up to about 36 months.<br>
A novel nutritional powder having improved oxidative stability and sensory performance would be useful.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One embodiment of the invention is directed to nutritional powders, including powder infant formulas, comprising carbohydrate; lipid, comprising from about 0.25% to about 2.5 % lecithin by weight of total lipid; from about 90% to about 99.5% intact protein by weight of total protein; and from about 0.5% to about 10% of at least one hydrolyzed protein selected from the group consisting of hydrolyzed casein protein and hydrolyzed whey protein, by weight of total prcfein; wherein the hydrolyzed protein has a degree of hydrolysis of between about 23%v and about 90%.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the nutritional powder embodiments of the present invention have improved oxidative stability and improved sensory performance. It has been found that select levels of hydrolyzed casein protein, whey protein, or combinations thereof, and lecithin provide a synergistic antioxidant effect, and can therefore be formulated into nutritional powders to reduce oxidation and to provide better sensory performance over prolonged periods.<br>

In this context, and unless otherwise specified, the term "substantilly free means that the selected composition contains less than a functional amount of the optional or selected ingredient, typically less than 0.1% by weignt and also including zero' percent by weight of such optional or selected ingredient,<br>
The embodiments described herein may comprise, consis of or consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any additional or optional ingredients, components, or limitations described herein or otherwise useful in nutritional powder formula applications<br>
Hydrolyzed Protein<br>
The various embodiments described herein may comprise from about 0.5% to about 10% of at least one hydrolyzed protein selected from the group consisting of hydrolyzed casein protein and hydrolyzed whey protein by weight of total protein, including from about 0.5% to about 5%, and also including from about 0.8% to about 3% by weight of total protein.<br>
The terms "hydrolysate" or "hydrolyzed protein" are used interchangeably herein and unless otherwise specified, refer to protein that has been hydrolyzed or broken down into shorter peptide fragments and/or amino acids. In the broadest sense a protein has been hydrolyzed when one or more peptide bonds have beem broken. Breaking of peptide bonds may occur unintentionally or incidentally during manufacture, for example, incidentally due to heating or shear. For purpoes of the nutritional powder embodiments herein, the terms "hydrolysate" or "hydrolyzed protein" mean a protein " that has been processed or treated in a manner intended to break peptide bonds. Intentional hydrolysis may be carried out, for example. by treating an intact protein with enzymes, acids, bases, or combinations thereof. the hydrolyzed proteins for use herein are typically prepared by enzyme hydrolysis.<br><br>
The hydrolyzed proteins for use herein are substantially free of intact protein. In this context, the hydrolyzed proteins herein contain less than 1.0% by weight of intact protein, including less than 0.5%, and also including zero percent by weight of intact protein, As'such, a single protein ingredient/commodity is not a source of both intact protein and hydrolyzed protein; rather, a single protein ingredient/commodity is either a hydrolyzed protein or an intact protein.<br>
The hydrolyzed casein proteins, hydrolyzed whey proteins, or combinations thereof, for use herein have a degree of hydrolysis of from about 23% to about 90%, including from about 27% to about 80%, and also including from about 45% to about 80%. Degree of hydrolysis is the extent to which peptide bonds are broken by an intentional hydrolysis method.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the degree of hydrolysis of a protein source is determined by the Tri-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) procedure. The TNBS procedure is an accurate and reproducible procedure for determining the degree of hydrolysis of a food protein source. The protein hydrolysate is dissolved/dispersed in hot 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate to a concentration of 0.25-2.5 ×10"3 amino equivalents/liter. A sample solution (0.25 milliliters) is mixed with 2 milliliters of 0.2125 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.2) and 2 milliliters of 0.1% trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid, followed by incubation in the dark for 60 minutes at 50°C. The reaction is quenched by adding 4 milliliters of 0.100 N HCI. The absorbance is then read at 340 nanometers. A 1.5 mM L-leucine solution is used as the standard. Transformation of the measured leucine amino equivalents to a degree of hydrolysis is carried out by way of a standard curve for each particular protein substrate (Jens Adler-Nissen, J. Agr. Food Chem. vol. 27, no. 6, 1979).<br>
For purposes of this invention, degree of protein hydrolysis is not the same as the amino nitrogen to total nitrogen ratio (AN/TN) of a protein source, in which the amino nitrogen (AN) component is quantified by USP titration methods for determining amino nitrogen content, while the total nitrogen (TN) component is determined by the Tecator Kjeldahl method. When a peptide bond in a protein is broken by enzymatic hydrolysis, one amino group is released for each peptide bond broken, causing an<br><br>
increase in the amino nitrogen. Using the AN/TN method, even non-hydrolyzed protein would contain some exposed amino groups, and thus have an AN/TN ratio of greater than zero.<br>
Casein protein is derived from milk. Casein protein is the main protein in bovine milk, making up approximately 80% of the protein in bovine milk. Casein protein is a highly nutritic' JS protein that contains 21 amino acids. Non-limiting examples of hydrolyzed cas'sin protein for use herein include hydrolyzed acid casein, hydrolyzed calcium caseinate, hydrolyzed magnesium caseinate, hydrolyzed sodium caseinate, any other salt forms thereof, and combinations thereof. The embodiments described herein typically comprise hydrolyzed calcium caseinate and/or hydrolyzed sodium caseinate.<br>
Whey protein is derived from whey, which may be a by-product of cheese manufactured from bovine milk. Whey protein is the other primary protein in bovine milk, making up approximately 20% of the protein in bovine milk- Non-limiting examples of hydrolyzed whey protein for use herein include hydrolyzed acid whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed acid whey protein concentrate, hydrolyzed whey protein concentrate, hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, and combinations thereof. The embodiments described herein typically comprise hydrolyzed whey protein isolate.<br>
Hydrolyzed casein protein and/or hydrolyzed whey protein suitable for use herein may be.obtained from any known or otherwise suitable nutrition source. Non-limiting examples include hydrolyzed casein protein and hydrolyzed whey protein from DMV International, Delhi, New York, USA; and hydrolyzed casein protein and hydrolyzed whey protein from Aria Food Ingredients, Skanderborgvej, Denmark.<br>
Intact Protein<br>
The various embodiments described herein may comprise from about 90% to about 99.5% intact protein by weight of total protein, including from about 95% to about 99.5%, and also including from about 97% to about 99.2% by weight of total protein.<br><br>
The term "intact protein" as used herein, unless otherwise specified, refers to protein that has not been intentionally processed or treated in a manner intended to break peptide bonds. Intact proteins are non-hydrolyzed proteins that have not been subject to intentional hydrolysis, and so have an unaltered primary structure (i.e. a complete amino acid sequence). Intact proteins have a degree of hydrolysis of zero. As such, the intact proteins for use herein are substantially free of hydrolyzed protein. In this context, the intact proteins for use herein contain less than 1.0% by weight of hyCrolyzed protein, including less than 0.5%, and also including zero percent by weight of hydrolyzed protein.<br>
Intact proteins Suitable for use herein may be obtained from any known or otherwise suitable nutrition source. Non-limiting examples of suitable intact proteins include soy based, milk based, casein protein, whey protein, rice protein, beef collagen, pea protein, potato protein, and combinations thereof.<br>
The embodiments herein may further comprise free amino acids. However, the nutritional powder embodiments herein typically comprise less than 10% free amino acids by weight of total protein, including from about 0.2% to about 7%. also including from about 0.2% to about 5%, and also including from about 0.2% to about 2% by weight of total protein. The free amino acids may be added, inherent in the hydrolyzed protein, or combinations thereof. For the purposes of this invention, added free amino acids that are not inherent in a hydrolyzed protein have a degree of hydrolysis of 100%. Non-limiting examples of suitableprotein free amino acids include tryptophan, glutamine, tyrosine, methionine, cysteine, arginine, and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of non-protein amino acids suitable for use herein include carnitine and taurine. In some cases, the D-forms of the amino acids are considered as nutritionally equivalent to the L-forms, and isomer mixtures may be used to lower costs.<br>
Lecithin<br>
The various embodiments described herein may comprise from abouf 0.25% to about 2.5 % lecithin by weight of total lipid, including from about 0.25% to about 1.5%, and also including from about 0.3% to about 0.8% by weight of total lipid.<br><br>
Lecithins are predominantly a mixture of glycerol phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidytinositol). Phosphotidlylcholine is typically the major gylcerol phospholipid component. Lecithins may also contain other compounds such as free fatty acids, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, glycolipids, and other lipid/fatty acid containing compounds. Lecithins are sometimes classifed as glycerol phospholipids or phosphotides. This class of compounds has ampliphilic properties and thus emulsifying functionality.<br>
Lecithins are typically added to liquid food products (including nutritional liquids), as emulsifiers, so that the liquid products remain homogeneous and do not separate. Lecithins are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for human consumption with the status "Generally Recognized As Safe." Non-limiting examples of lecithins suitable for use herein include egg lecithin, wheat lecithin, corn lecithin, soy lecithin, modified lecithin, and combinations thereof. The embodiments described herein typically comprise soy lecithin.<br>
Lecithins suitable for use herein may be obtained from any known or otherwise suitable nutrition source. Non-limiting examples include soy lecithin from ADM Specialty Food Ingredients, Decatur, Illinois, USA; soy lecithin from Solae, LLC, St. Louis, Missouri, USA; and soy lecithin from American Lecithin Company, Oxford, Connecticut, USA.<br>

The exemplified formula\may be prepared by making at least two separate slurries that are later blended together, heat treated, standardized, heat treated a second time, evaporated to remove water, and then spray dried.<br>
Initially, a carbohydrate-mineral slurry is prepared by dissolving the carbohydrate {i.e., lactose) in water at about 60 - 71°C, followed by the addition of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium citrate, choline chloride, and sodium chloride. The resulting slurry is held under moderate agitation at about 49 - 60°C until it is later blended with the other prepared slurries.<br>
A protein-in-oil slurry is prepared by combining high oleic sunflower oil, soybean oil, and coconut oil at about 49 - 60°C, followed by the addition of ascorbyl palmitate, mixed tocopherols, soy lecithin, oil soluble vitamin premix, whey protein concentrate, casein hydrolysate and/or whey hydrolysate, and calcium carbonate. The resulting oil slurry is held under moderate agitation at about 38 - 49QC until it is later blended with the other prepared slurries.<br>
Water, the carbohydrate-mineral slurry and the protein-in-oil slurry, are combined under adequate agitation. The pH of the resulting blend is adjusted with potassium hydroxide. This blend is held under moderate agitation at about 49-60cC. The ARA and DHA oil is added following the pH adjustment and prior to processing.<br>
The resulting blend is heated to about 71-77DC, emulsified through a single stage homogenizer to a maximum of about 300 psig, and then heated to about 82-88°C, for about 5 seconds. The heated blend is passed through a flash cooler to reduce the temperature to about 77-82°C and then passed through a plate cooler to further<br><br>
reduce the temperature to about 71-77°C. The cooled blend is then homogenized at about 2400-2600/400-600 psig, held at about 74-85°C for about 16 seconds and then cooled to 2-7°C. Samples are taken for microbiological and analytical testing. The mixture is held under agitation at about 2-7°C.<br>
A water-soluble vitamin (WSV) solution and an ascorbic acid solution are prepared separately and added to the processed blended slurry. The vitamin so-ution is prepared by adding the following ingredients to water with agitation: potassium citrate, ferrous sulfate, WSV premix, L-carnitine, riboflavin, and nucleotide-Choline premix. The ascorbic acid solution is prepared by adding potassium hydroxide and ascorbic acid to a sufficient amount of water to dissolve the ingredients.  The ascorbic acid solution pH is then adjusted to about 5-9 with potassium hydroxide.<br>
The blend pH may be adjusted to a pH range of about 6.65 - 6.85 with potassium hydroxide to achieve optimal product stability. The standardized blend then receives a second heat treatment. The blend is heated to about 66 - 82°C. and then further heated to about 118 - 124°C for about 5 seconds. The heated blend is then passed through a flash cooler to reduce the temperature to about 71 - 82°C Following heat treatment, the blend is evaporated down to a density of about 1.15 - 1.17 grams/milliliter.<br>
The evaporated blend is passed through a spray drier, targeting a moisture level of about 2.5% in the finished powder. The finished powder then undergoes agglomeration with water as the binder solution. The completed product is then packaged into suitable containers.<br>
STUDY 1<br>
A study is conducted to evaluate the antioxidant capability of oil blends comprising iecithin, hydrolyzed casein protein, and combinations thereof. The batch variables are described below in the Study 1 results table.<br><br>
Oxidative Stability Index (OSI)<br>
The oxidative stability index (OSI) is a method for determining the ability of an oil to resist oxidation. Oil samples are exposed to heat and a constant flow of air. As the ability of the oil to resist oxidation is overcome, a rapid increase in the production of oxidation products (volatile organic acids) occurs. The organic acids are dissolved in a collection tube containing deionized water. The organic acids increase the conductivity of the water, as measured by an electrode. A plot is generated and an OSI value calculated for each sample, which correlates with the amount of tiirfe, in hours, the sample resisted excessive oxidation.<br>
Five-gram oil samples are analyzed using an OSI instrument (Omnion the, Rockland, Mass., U.S.A.) at approximately 130° C with s*n airflow corresponding to 4.5 psi (40 Kpa). Each sample contains a base oil blend comprising, by weight of the base oil blend, approximately 40% high oleic safflower oil, 30% soy oil, 28% coconut oil, 0.37% mixed tocopherols, 0.026% ascorbyi palmitate, 0.13% oil soluble vitamin premix, 0.38% DHA oil, and 1.0% ARA oil. Hydrolyzed casein protein, lecithin, and combinations thereof, are added to the base oil blend. Oil samples are agitated thoroughly to ensure a homogeneous sample prior to analysis. Samples are tested in duplicate. The entire study is repeated on 3 separate day, so that Day 1 and Day 2 results are generated, which are summarized in the following table.<br><br><br><br>

% represents the amount of ingredient as a percent by weight of the total OSI sample.<br>
* The percentage, by weight, of protein in the total OSI sample is calculated to assimilate adding<br>
either 1 % or 2% of hydrolyzed protein by weight of total protein in a nutritional powder to the oil blend<br>
of the nutritional powder.<br>
** "Expected OSI Result" represents the summation of the "Average OSI Results" for each of the<br>
individual components (i.e.. lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein) in the oil blend sample. For<br>
example, the Expected OSI Result for the Day 1 oil blend sample (Sample B) comprising 1.0% lecithin<br>
and 0.99% hydrolyzed casein protein is 7.4. which is the sum of the Average OSI Result for: 1) the<br>
Day 1 oil biend sample (Sample G) comprising 1.0% lecithin (3.38); and 2) the Day 1 oil blend sample<br>
(Sample F) comprising 0.99% hydrolyzed casein protein (4.03).<br>
As shown in the above data table, lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein exhibit a synergistic antioxidant effect under the above-described conditions. Surprisingly, samples comprising lecithin in combination with hydrolyzed casein protein (Samples B, C, D, and E) are more effective in protecting against oxidation than expected, as the combination of lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein provides greater protection against oxidation than the sum of the amount of protection provided, individually, by lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein. For example, the Day 2 expected result for the oil blend comprising 0.40% lecithin and 0.99% hydrolyzed casein protein (Sample C) is 8.7; however, the actual average OSI result is 20.8. Surprisingly, the actual average OSI result is more than double that of the expected result, which is the sum of the oil biend comprising 0.40% lecithin (Sample 1) and the oil blend comprising 0.99% hydrolyzed casein protein (Sample G).<br><br>
STUDY 2<br>
A study is conducted to evaluate the antioxidant capability of powdered nutritional formulations comprising lecithin, hydrolyzed casein protein, hydrolyzed whey protein, and combinations thereof.<br>
Formulations are evaluated for oxidative stability in accordance with the methods described below. These include peroxide value (PV), sensory evaluation, oxidative stability index by NMR (OSI-NMR), and volatile organic compound (VOC) evaluation.<br>
The nutritional powder formulas in the study are similar to commercially available SIMILAC® Advance Powder (Abbott Nutrition, a division of Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio, USA) except that the sample powders are modified to include hydrolyzed casein protein, hydrolyzed whey protein, lecithin, and combinations thereof according to the following table.<br><br>

The base formula used to prepare each test sample contains approximately (per 100 kcal): 2.07 grams protein (non fat dry milk, whey protein concentrate), 5.4 grams fat (high-oleic safflower, soy, coconut oils, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid), 10.8 grams carbohydrate (lactose), minerals (calcium 78 mg, phosphorus 42 mg, magnesium 6 mg, sodium 24 mg, potassium 105 mg, chloride 65 mg, iron 1.8 mg, zinc 0.75 mg, copper 0.09 mg, iodine 0.006 mg, manganese 5 ug, selenium 1.8 ug), and vitamins (vitamin A 300 IU, vitamin D 60 IU, vitamin E 1.5 IU, vitamin K 8 ug, vitamin C 9 mg, thiamine 0.100 mg. riboflavin 0.150 mg, pyridoxine 0.060 mg, niacin 1050 mg, vitamin B^ 0.25 ug, folic acid 15 ug, pantothenic acid 0.450 mg, biotin 4.4 ug, choline 16 mg, inositol 4.7 mg).<br><br>
Preparation<br>
Each nutritional powder study formula is batched, processed, and spray dried in a pilot plant facility. To prepare the study formulas, a base oil blend is prepared by combining high oleic sunflower oil, soybean oil, and coconut oil at about 49 - 60°C, followed by the addition of oil soluble vitamins, ascorbyi palmitate (374 ppm) and mixed tocopherols (375 ppm). The base oil blend is split into portions, and select levels of lecithin are added to each portion to make up distinct variables. The oil blend is added, under agitation at a temperature of about 49-60°C, to a slurry containing water, lactose, non-fat dry milk, and intact whey protein concentrate under agitation. Based on the study formula, hydrolyzed casein protein, hydrolyzed whey protein, and combinations thereof, are added to the resulting slurry. The resulting blend is high temperature short time (HTST) processed and homogenized at about 33% solids. The blends are standardized with vitamins and minerals, and evaporated to about 52% solids. The resulting product is then ultra high temperature (UHT) processed before feeding to (he spray dryer. The powders are dried to a moisture content of about 2-3% by weight of the powder.<br>
The spray-dried powders are packaged in cans with about a 0.5 inch (1.27 centimeter) headspace, with fill weights ranging from about 350 to about 390 grams. Lids are sealed onto the cans under normal atmospheric conditions, without modification to the headspace.<br>
One week following.manufacture, closed cans of the formulated samples are placed in elevated temperature storage, at about 37°C and about 43°C. Following 2 weeks of incubation, the cans are opened and samples are pulled for testing. Between sampling, the cans are sealed with plastic commercial can overcaps and returned to elevated temperature storage. Following 5 weeks of elevated temperature storage, samples are pulled for testing.<br>
Peroxide Value<br>
Peroxides are primary products of lipid oxidation, and the measurement of their formation may be used to assess the ability of a nutritional powder to resist oxidation,      The   peroxide  value   method   is   based   on   the   International   Dairy<br><br>
Foundation (IDF) method for the determination of peroxide value (IDF Standard 74A:1991, International Dairy Foundation, June 1991), which measures peroxide levels by utilizing the oxidation of Fe II to Fe III by lipid/fatty acid hydroperoxides. Fe 111 complexes with reagent thtocyanate to form a red colored complex that is measured spectrophotometrically at 500 nanometers. The concentration of Fe III is then determined using a series of Fe 111 standard solutions and linear regression.<br>
Each nutritional powder formula is evaluated following 5 weeks of elevated temperature storage. The formulas are first reconstituted in water. The lipid system of the reconstituted product is extracted, after the addition of methanol, by isooctane and then water for phase separation. After centrifugation, a quantitative aliquot of the clear isooctane extract is dried and then mixed with a 70% chloroform/30% by volume methanol solvent mixture, ammonium thiocyanate, and ferrous chloride under acidic conditions. The extracted lipid is then analyzed via the aforementioned IDF test method, the results of which are summarized in the following table.<br><br>

As shown in above data table, the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein (Sample B) or lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) are much more effective in resisting peroxide formation and thus oxidation than the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and no hydrolyzed proteins (Samples A and B) under the study conditions. The nutritional powder comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) was most effective in resisting peroxide formation.<br><br>
Sensory Evaluation<br>
The sensory evaluation method provides an evaluation of oxidative stability by sensory detection of off-flavors and odors from compounds generated during the oxidation of oils. The sensory evaluation also provides an evaluation of the overall sensory performance of nutritional powders. Each nutritional powder formula is evaluated following 2 and 5 weeks of elevated temperature storage by a trained sensory panel. The nutritional powders are evaluated and then assigned a rating in accordance with the 5-point scale described in the following two tables.   .<br><br>
Rating	Oxidation	Sensory Oxidation Evaluation Ratings<br>

As shown in the above data tables, the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and no hydrolyzed proteins (Samples A and D) displayed fishy notes and accelerated oxidation off-flavor development over the five-week test period. In contrast, the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein {Sample B) or lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) displayed no fishy notes or oxidation off-flavors at an elevated temperature of 37°C, no fishy notes at 43°C, and delayed oxidation off-flavors at 43°C.<br>
The sensory data are consistent with the above-described peroxide value data, and show that a mixture of lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein or a mixture of lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein, as described herein, is able to protect powdered nutritional products better than lecithin alone under the above-described conditions.<br>
Oxidative Stability Index (OSI) as determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (OSI-NMR)<br>
The oxidative stability index (OSI-NMR) is a method for determining the ability of a nutritional powder to resist oxidation. The OSI-NMR test method is similar to the published work of Hiroaki Saito and Kunisuke Nakamura (Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, Vol. 55(9), 1663, (1989)) except that the Folch extraction method is modified to<br><br>
extract the lipids and fatty acid containing structures from the nutritional formula matrix.<br>
LIPID EXTRACTION: To extract the lipid, each powder sample is mixed to minimize<br>
sample heterogeneity. Approximately 100 milligrams, within a variance of 2%, of<br>
each sample is weighed into glass screw-top centrifuge tubes. A 1 milliliter aliquot of<br>
methanol-cU is pipetted into each tube and then vortexed for one minute. Next,<br>
milliliters of chloroform-d are added. The viais are then vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
The solutions are maintained at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes and ..<br>
then are cold-centrifuged at 3,000 G for 10 minutes. The supernatant is then filtered<br>
through 0.2 millimeter PTFE syringe filters.	]<br>
The extracted lipids are then analyzed via the aforementioned OSI-NMR test method. The regions of the NMR spectra used for integration are 1.1-2.6 ppm (aliphatic) and 2.7-2.9 ppm (diattyl) to produce an aliphaticldiallyl ratio.<br>
Each nutritional powder formula is evaluated following 5 weeks of elevated temperature storage, the results of which are summarized in the following table.<br><br>

As shown in the above data table, the nutritional powders comprising iecithin and " hydrolyzed casein protein (Sample B) or lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) have lower aliphatic/diallyl ratios and thus are more effective in protecting against oxidation than the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and no hydrolyzed proteins (Samples A and B) under the study conditions. Consistent with the peroxide value results above, the nutritional powder comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) was most effective in resisting oxidation.<br><br>
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Evaluation<br>
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are secondary products of lipid oxidation, and the measurement of their formation may be used to assess lipid oxidation. The VOC method involves the sampling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically hexanal, by heated headspace (HS) and the analysis of collected components by gas.chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),<br>
Each nutritional powder formula is evaluated following 2 and 5 weeks of elevated<br>
temperature storage.    The formulas are reconstituted in water and stirred under<br>
vortex for 5 minutes. Then using a glass pipette, 1 gram of the reconstituted sample<br>
is placed into a 20 milliliter amber headspace vial that contains 4 milliliters of<br>
laboratory water and 2 grams of sodium chloride. The sample is then spiked with a<br>
total of 250  nanograms of internal  standard  (chlorobenzene-ds),  sealed with  a<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) lined silicon septum, and vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
Samples are then analyzed via HS GC-MS analysis.   The HS GC-MS analysis is<br>
conducted using the following equipment and parameters.<br>

The compounds (e.g., hexanai) detected during the HS GC-MS analysis are identified using the National Institute of Standards Mass Spectral Database. The ' areas (total ion counts) of the compounds detected and the area (total ion count) of the internal standard (ISTD) are used to calculate concentration according to the following equation:<br>
Area of Compound x Total Amount ISTD (nanograms) = Concentration (parts per billion)<br>

As shown in the above data table, less hexanai (i.e., a VOC compound) is released from the nutritional powders comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein (Sample B) or lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) as compared to the<br><br>
nutritional powders comprising lecithin and no hydrolyzed protein (Samples A and D) under the study conditions. Once again, the nutritional powder comprising lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein (Sample C) was most effective in resisting oxidation.<br>
The VOC data are consistent with the above-described peroxide value, sensory, and OSI-NMR data and show that a mixture of lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein and even more so a mixture of lecithin and hydrolyzed whey protein, as described herein, are able to protect powdered nutritional products better than lecithin alone under the above-described conditions.<br>
As shown in the above data tables for Study 2, lecithin in combination with hydrolyzed casein protein or hydrolyzed whey protein provides a greater than expected antioxidant effect in a nutritional powder matrix, which is consistent with the Study 1 OSI results that demonstrate the synergism of lecithin and hydrolyzed casein protein in an oil blend matrix as described hereinbefore.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The collective data from the studies show that lecithin in combination with hydrolyzed casein protein or hydrolyzed whey protein, as described herein, provide a synergistic antioxidant effect in a nutritional powder matrix. The combination of hydrolyzed casein protein and lecithin, or hydrolyzed whey protein and lecithin, as described herein, is highly effective for protecting nutritional powders from oxidation and for providing better sensory performance over prolonged periods.<br>
The results are surprising because lecithin, hydrolyzed casein protein, and hydrolyzed whey protein are not conventional nutritional powder antioxidants. Lecithin, although generally known to have antioxidant properties, is not typically added to nutritional powders as an antioxidant. Lecithin is more typically added to nutritional liquids; however, lecithin is added to nutritional liquids for its functionality as an emulsifier, rather than as an antioxidant. Furthermore, hydrolyzed casein protein and/or hydrolyzed whey protein are typically added to nutritional powders to improve protein tolerance, not as an antioxidant. The data is especially surprising because not only are  lecithin,  hydrolyzed casein  protein, and  hydrolyzed whey<br><br>
protein non-conventional nutritional powder antioxidants; remarkably, lecithin in combination with hydrolyzed whey protein or hydrolyzed casein protein provides a synergistic antioxidant in nutritional powder matrices.<br><br>
