				<td>Clamping Device for Needles<br>
The invention relates to a needle holder that is suitable,<br>
in general, for needles and, in particular for embroidery<br>
needles, for example, Schifflin needles.<br>
Embroidery machines, in particular large embroidery<br>
machines, are provided with needle rods, each having on its end<br>
a clamping device for a needle. The needles are also referred<br>
to as embroidery needles or as Schifflin needles. During the<br>
embroidery process, the needle rods are moved back and forth in<br>
axial direction in order to repeatedly puncture the needle<br>
through a textile product.<br>
The frequent change of needles is necessary.<br>
To do so, document GB 387 073 suggests that needles held<br>
on a bar be mounted in a revolver head which, for example, can<br>
be moved inzo four index positions. If one of the four needles<br>
held on the revolver head breaks, the revolver head may be<br>
rotated forward by 90Â° in order to bring a new needle into<br>
position. The needles are held on the revolver head by means of<br>
a clamping claw, which can be tightened or loosened by means of<br>
a fastening screw.<br>
Furthermore, document DE-OS 1 927 498 discloses a needle<br>
holder in which several needles are held in a pivotable manner.<br><br>
They can be selectively moved into a rest position or a working<br>
position. Consequently, threads of different colors can be<br>
selected.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a possibility<br>
for fastening the needles to the needle rods so as to make<br>
possible a simple and rapid needle change.<br>
This object is achieved with a needle holder in accordance<br>
with Claim 1:<br>
The needle holder in accordance with the invention<br>
comprises a needle-receiving part with a clamping part and a<br>
fixing part, by means of which the needle clamping part can be<br>
fixed in a clamping position. The needle holder is provided on<br>
a needle rod in an extension. It may also be seamlessly<br>
connected in one piece thereto. The fixing element is pushed<br>
onto the needle clamping part in order to fix it in place and<br>
is moved away from the clamping part in order to release it.<br>
Thus, the needle can be fastened in a particularly easy manner<br>
to the needle rod, and removed therefrom in an equally easy<br>
manner, in one simple manual step. The direction of insertion<br>
or removal of the needle is possible transverse to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the needle or the needle rod. Thus,<br>
the change of the needle is not affected by objects that are in<br>
front of the needle tip. Therefore, the manual effort required<br>
for changing the needle is quite minimal. On the other hand,<br>
the needle is securely held on the needle rod.<br>
The needle-receiving part of the needle holder or the<br>
needle rod has, as the seat for the accommodation of the<br>
needle, preferably an elongated channel-like recess which is<br><br>
adapted to one end of the needle. This end of the needle, also<br>
referred to as the "plunger", represents the holding section. A<br>
transverse pin or a transverse rib may be located in the<br>
channel-like recess. This pin or this rib may be associated<br>
with a notch provided in one end of the needle. However, it is<br>
also possible to set state-of-the-art needles with a flattened<br>
plunger or end - as they are currently used in large numbers in<br>
the textile industry - into such a needle holder. Thus, it is<br>
retro-compatible.<br>
Preferably, the needle clamping part is configured as a<br>
tension flap that is supported in a manner so as to be<br>
pivotable toward the end of the needle and away therefrom. On<br>
one side, the end of the plunger or the needle is accommodated<br>
by the needle-receiving part. Its other side is held by the<br>
needle clamping part, for example having the form of a clamping<br>
flap. In tensioned state, the clamping flap or the needle<br>
clamping part is radially pushed against the plunger of the<br>
needle, as a result of which the needle, in turn, is pushed<br>
into the needle-receiving part and thus clamped in place. This<br>
clamping position is secured by the fixing element. If, as<br>
opposed to this, the fixing element is released, the clamping<br>
flap may be folded away from the plunger of the needle. Thus it<br>
clears half of the cylindrical space enclosing the plunger. In<br>
other words, when the end of the needle is clamped in place,<br>
the needle clamping part is moved into a space, which is<br>
located - relative to the end of the needle - radially above<br>
the seat of said needle. During the release step, the needle<br>
clamping part is cleared, i.e., the clamping flap, is moved out<br>
of the region of this space. Thus, the embroidery needle can be<br>
easily removed from the needle holder. A new needle can simply<br>
be set into the needle holder. It is not necessary to axially<br><br>
thread or fit said needle into any openings.<br>
Preferably the needle clamping part and the needle-<br>
receiving part, together, essentially complement each other to<br>
form a cylindrical external contour when the needle clamping<br>
element, e.g., the clamping flap, is in clamping position. This<br>
permits a slim design, as well as also a simple fixation of the<br>
needle clamping part in the clamping position. This applies,<br>
independent of whether the clamping flap can be pivoted about a<br>
pivot axis that is transverse to the longitudinal direction of<br>
the needle and approximately parallel to a separating surface<br>
between the needle-receiving part and the needle clamping part,<br>
or can be pivoted about a pivot axis that is oriented in a<br>
direction parallel to the needle axis. In both cases, the<br>
fixing element may easily be slid over the resultant<br>
cylindrical external contour in order to secure the needle<br>
clamping part in clamping position.<br>
This shifting of the fixing element preferably occurs in<br>
the course of a pivoting motion. For example, the fixing<br>
element is configured as a notch lever that is laterally slid<br>
over the needle clamping part. In so doing, the fixing element,<br>
in one embodiment, may be pivotally supported on the needle-<br>
receiving part. The pivot axis is oriented parallel to the<br>
needle, for example. It is also possible to support the fixing<br>
element so as to be rotatable about the needle-receiving part<br>
about a central axis that is concentric to the axis of<br>
rotation. Alternatively, the fixing element may also be<br>
supported in a pivotable manner on the needle clamping part in<br>
order to come into engagement with the needle-receiving part<br>
when in clamping position.<br><br>
The fixing element may be held in its fixing position by<br>
at least one detent means. For example, the fixing means may<br>
consist of a slightly elastic plastic material that imparts the<br>
fixing element with resilience or a spring effect. When<br>
configured as a pivotally supported lever with a recess, this<br>
lever can be pivoted toward the needle clamping part in such a<br>
manner that said lever's recess comes into engagement with the<br>
needle clamping part and, at the same time, tensions said<br>
needle clamping part relative to the plunger of the needle.<br>
When the aforementioned principles are applied, numerous<br>
modifications are possible. In addition, it is possible to used<br>
said features in almost any combination with each other. In so<br>
doing, the features may be used individually, as well as in any<br>
combination or partial combination.<br>
The description hereinafter is restricted to several<br>
embodiments of the invention in order to explain essential<br>
elements of said invention, as well as other situations. The<br>
drawings disclose additional details and are to be referred to<br>

modification of the needle holder in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a needle holder 1 in accordance with the<br>
invention, said needle holder being configured as a quick-<br>
release clamping holder. This needle holder comprises a needle-<br>
receiving part 2 that is disposed to fasten a needle rod. To<br>
achieve this, the needle-receiving part 2 is provided with a<br>
journal 3 on its one end. Extending away therefrom is the<br>
remaining body 4 of the needle-receiving part 2. The body 4<br>
has, on its end opposite the journal 3, approximately the shape<br>
of a longitudinally divided semi-cylinder which has a<br>
preferably flat surface 5 extending essentially in longitudinal<br>
direction. This surface is traversed by a channel-like recess<br>
that forms a seat 6 for the accommodation, of the end 7 of a<br>
needle. This end 7 ("plunger") is disposed to support or fasten<br>
the needle. The needle is an embroidery needle, for example.<br>
The seat 6 is associated with a needle clamping part 8<br>
that is configured as a pivotable clamping jaw. This needle<br>
clamping part has a semi-cylindrical form and has an also<br>
preferably flat surface 9 that faces the preferably flat<br>
surface 5. If necessary, the surface 9 may be provided with a<br>
groove or other recesses. In the present exemplary embodiment,<br>
the end 7 of the needle is flattened, whereby the flattened<br>
side faces the surface 9. Apart from that, the needle clamping<br>
part 8 is essentially semi-cylindrical, whereby it has, on one<br>
end, an extension 10 that is disposed to provide a pivotable<br>
support for the clamping part 8 on the body 4. The extension 10<br>
extends into a corresponding recess of the body 4 and is held<br>
there by a not specifically illustrated transverse pin. This<br>
pi.n is seated in an appropriate transverse bore 11 and defines<br>
a pivot axis 12 for the clamping part 8. As a result of this,<br>
the clamping part 8 can be pivoted toward the end 7 of the<br>
needle and away therefrom. The pivot axis 12 is preferably<br><br>
oriented in a direction transverse to a longitudinal center<br>
axis 13 of the needle. In addition, the pivot axis 12 is<br>
preferably oriented parallel to the surface 5. Figure 1 shows<br>
the needle clamping part 8 in its release position. In this<br>
release position, an acute aperture angle of at least 45<br>
degrees, preferably at least 75 degrees, is formed between the<br>
surface 9 of the needle clamping part 8 and the surface 5 of<br>
the body 4. Due to this, it is easy to remove the needle by its<br>
end 7 from its seat 6. This is done with the clamping part 8<br>
folded open and with the seat completely exposed.<br>
In addition, a fixing element 14 belongs to the needle<br>
holder 1, said fixing element being represented by a notch<br>
lever 15 in the present exemplary embodiment. This notch lever<br>
is preferably mounted on the needle-receiving part 2 so as to<br>
be pivotable about a pivot axis 16, said axis being defined by<br>
a journal 17 extending through an opening of the notch lever<br>
15. The journal 17 and the pivot axis 16 preferably extend<br>
parallel to the longitudinal central axis 13 that is defined by<br>
the seat 6 and thus in a direction transverse to the pivot axis<br>
12.<br>
The notch lever 15 consists, for example, of a slightly<br>
resilient plastic material. It is provided with an opening or a<br>
recess 18 that approximately follows the cylindrical contour<br>
that is defined, together by the needle-receiving part 2 and<br>
the needle clamping part 8 when the needle clamping part 8 is<br>
in clamping position as shown by Figure 2. In so doing, the<br>
contour of the recess 18 follows the contour of the cylinder up<br>
to a projection 19 with which the notch lever 15 extends over<br>
the needle clamping part 8, thus tensioning against the end 7<br>
of the needle.<br><br>
The one bearing end 20 of the lever 15 is seated on the<br>
pin 17 and has a handle end 21 located on the opposite side,<br>
said handle end acting as a feature for moving the lever 15 out<br>
of its relea.se position shown in Figure 1 into its fixing<br>
position shown in Figure 2. In addition, a thread guide 22<br>
configured as an eyelet may be held on the notch lever 15.<br>
Particularly suitable therefor is the rear side of the notch<br>
lever 15 facing away from the recess 18. The thread guide 22<br>
may be represented by a screwed-on bent sheet metal piece.<br>
Furthermore, the notch lever 15 is secured on the journal<br>
17 by means of a retaining ring.<br>
In some embodiments the notch lever 15 may consist<br>
entirely of slightly elastic plastic material, as mentioned,<br>
and can thus itself provide the spring action with respect to<br>
the radial direction of the journal 17, as is necessary for the<br>
engagement effect. It is also possible to make the notch lever<br>
15 of a stiff material, for example metal, and to provide<br>
elastic means in the region of its recess 18, for example, in<br>
the form of resiliently supported tongues or other elements,<br>
elastic linings or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to<br>
elastically support the journal 17 or to provide an elastic<br>
bushing or similarly elastic means between the journal 17 and<br>
the bearing end 20. All of these measures and additional<br>
corresponding measures are suitable to permit the projection 19<br>
to yield in an elastic manner when said projection is pushed<br>
over the rounded outside of the needle clamping part 8.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the needle holder 1 in a side view,<br>
in closed state, in which case the notch lever 15 has been<br><br>
omitted. As is obvious, the end 7 of the needle is clamped<br>
between the needle clamping part 8 and the needle-receiving<br>
part 2. However, as shown by Figure 4, positioning of the end 7<br>
is defined by a pin 24 which fits into a notch 25 of the<br>
plunger or end 7 of the needle. The pin 24 is arranged at least<br>
approximately parallel to a pin 26 seated in the transverse<br>
bore 11, thus forming the hinge joint for the needle clamping<br>
part 8. The pin 24 traverses the depression-shaped or channel-<br>
shaped seat 6.<br>
The needle holder 1 described so far operates as follows:<br>
In order to change the needle, the notch lever 15 is moved<br>
into a release position, as shown by Figure 1, in that said<br>
lever is pivoted away from the needle clamping part 8. This<br>
part is now freely movable and can be pivoted away from the<br>
needle or its end 7. In so doing, the needle clamping part 8<br>
frees a semi-cylindrical space relative to a longitudinal<br>
central axis 13, said space being largely cleared, preferably<br>
completely cleared, so that the needle is exposed to daylight<br>
in its seat 6. The needle may be removed, e.g., by hand, and,<br>
if necessary be replaced in the seat or be exchanged for<br>
another needle. In so doing, the removal direction of the<br>
needle is transverse to the longitudinal direction of the<br>
needle. In order to clamp the needle in place, the needle<br>
clamping part 8 is moved from the release position shown by<br>
Figure 1 to the end 7 of the needle. In so doing, the notch<br>
lever 15 is slid over the needle clamping part 8 by a pivoting<br>
motion, as shown by Figure 2. Due to the adapted diameter of<br>
the recess 18, as well as due to the flexibility or elasticity<br>
of the notch lever 15, the clamping element 8 is pushed against<br>
the end 7 and thus fixed in clamping position. Consequently,<br><br>
the notch lever 15 forms a fixing element for the clamping part<br>
The needle holder forms a quick-release clamping holder<br>
which can be opened and closed with a few particularly simple<br>
motions of the hands, so that exchanging the needle is<br>
particularly easy.<br>
Figure 5 shows a modified embodiment of the needle holder<br>
1. Different from the description so far, the journal 17<br>
supports two notch levers 15a, 15, which can be pivoted in<br>
opposite directions, and whereby said levers can be slid from<br>
opposite sides over the needle clamping part 8. Other than<br>
that, the above description applies analogously, using the same<br>
reference numbers, whereby only details relating to the notch<br>
levers 15a, 15b are labeled with letters for differentiation.<br>
As is obvious from Figure 6, in particular, the clamping levers<br>
15a, 15b, together, form a fixing element for the needle<br>
clamping part 8. In fixing position, the handle ends 21a, 21b<br>
can be in alignment with each other or, as illustrated, can be<br>
offset relative to each other.<br>
Referring to the above embodiments of the needle holder,<br>
the fixing element is supported on the needle-receiving part 2<br>
or the body 4 that is preferably connected seamlessly in one<br>
piece with the needle-receiving part. However, as is shown by<br>
Figures 7 and 8, it is also possible to support the fixing<br>
element on the needle clamping part 8. To do so, the needle<br>
clamping part 8 - which, in turn, may have on its outside a<br>
preferably cylindrically curved surface (but need not be that<br>
way) - is provided with an extension 27, from which the journal<br>
28 extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of a cylinder that<br><br>
is defined by the needle-receiving part 2 and the needle<br>
clamping part 8. Again, a notch lever 29 may be seated on the<br>
journal 28 as the fixing element, said notch lever having an<br>
appropriate opening 30 for the accommodation of the journal 28.<br>
The notch lever 29 has a hook-shaped end 31 that can extend<br>
around under the needle seat. On its opposite end, said hook-<br>
shaped end may be provided with a thread guide device 32.<br>
The actuation takes place as is obvious from Figures 7 and<br>
8. If the hook-shaped end 31 is slid under the needle-receiving<br>
part 2, the outermost section of the end 31 forms a projection<br>
19 that engages the notch lever 29 in this position. At the<br>
same time, the needle clamping part 8 is tensioned against the<br>
needle-receiving part 2. If the end 31, however, is moved away<br>
from the needle-receiving part 2 by appropriately pivoting the<br>
notch lever, the needle clamping part 8 is released. It can now<br>
be folded into the open position. As shown by Figures 1 and 2,<br>
this is accomplished with a needle clamping part 8 that can be<br>
pivoted about a pivot axis 12 transverse to the needle. This<br>
can also be accomplished with other embodiments, in which the<br>
needle clamping part 8, as shown in particular by Figure 8, can<br>
be pivoted about a pivot axis 12a that is oriented parallel to<br>
the longitudinal extension of the seat 6 and thus is aligned<br>
with the longitudinal axis 13 that is also indicated in Figure<br>
8. Other than that, the previous description, in particular<br>
also with regard to the pin 24, applies analogously.<br>
Figure 9 shows another modified embodiment of the<br>
invention. This embodiment is essentially based on the<br>
embodiment in accordance with Figures 1 and 2, with analogous<br>
reference being made to the description of said embodiment and<br>
using the same reference numbers. However, there are<br><br>
differences regarding the design of the fixing element which,<br>
in this case is not configured as a notch lever but as a<br>
clamping lever 33. Said latter lever is provided with a<br>
pivotally supported lever-actuated eccentric clamping device<br>
34, instead of with a detent projection. The lever-actuated<br>
eccentric clamping device 34 is represented by a clamping cam<br>
35 that is arranged on the clamping lever 33 so as to be<br>
pivotable and preferably located on the outermost end or edge<br>
of said lever's recess 18. It replaces the (detent) projection<br>
19. A pin 36 that radially extends away from the clamping cam<br>
35 acts as the lever for tightening and releasing the clamping<br>
cam 35.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show another possible modification. This<br>
embodiment applies similar principles as the above-described<br>
embodiments. However, different from the aforementioned<br>
embodiments, it is particularly suitable for the direct<br>
integration in a needle rod 37, while, based on the above-<br>
described concept, the needle holder 1 is intended as an<br>
attachment component for a needle rod.<br>
Thus, in accordance with Figures 10 and 11, the needle rod<br>
37 forms its own needle holder 1', whereby its needle-side end<br>
is configured accordingly. A longitudinal groove is provided in<br>
the end of the needle rod so that the end of the needle rod 37<br>
forms the needle-receiving part 2' with the seat 6'. The end 7<br>
of the needle can be placed in this seat 6'. In the groove<br>
forming the seat 6', the needle clamping part 8' having the<br>
shape of a tongue or finger can be pivoted in the groove and be<br>
folded into the groove. In so doing, the needle clamping part<br>
8' is dimensioned in such a manner that said clamping part<br>
projects minimally beyond the outside circumference of the end<br><br>
of the needle rod 37 when said clamping part is in clamping<br>
position, i.e., in the groove. As is obvious from Figure 11,<br>
said clamping part's rear-side edges are provided with chamfers<br>
38, 39, i.e., they are chamfered, so that a fixing part can be<br>
smoothly pushed beyond the needle clamping part 8', or its<br>
section that projects beyond the outside circumference of the<br>
needle rod 37, in order to fix the needle in place.<br>
Around the end of the needle rod 37, i.e., around the<br>
needle-receiving part 2', there is a flat groove 40 in which is<br>
seated a fixing element. In this case, this element is<br>
represented by a rotary body 41 that is seated with an opening<br>
on the needle-receiving part 2' in the groove 40 and, in so<br>
doing, extends around the needle-receiving part 2'. However,<br>
the edge of the opening of the rotary body 41 is not<br>
continuously closed. Rather, the edge has a passage 42 which<br>
can act as a passage for the needle clamping part 8'. Figure 10<br>
shows the release position, and Figure 11 shows the clamping<br>
position. In clamping position, the rotary body 41 is slid over<br>
the needle clamping part 8' in such a manner that said body<br>
tensions said clamping part against the end 7 of the needle. In<br>
order to move the clamping body 41, a handle 43 connected<br>
thereto may be used. Other than that, the above description<br>
applies analogously, with the supplementary use of the same<br>
reference numbers.<br>
Additional modifications are possible. For example the<br>
rotary body 41 may be rounded on its outside, as shown by<br>
Figure 12, in which case - other than that - the description of<br>
the embodiments in accordance with Figures 10 and 11 applies<br>
analogously.<br><br>
The rotary body 41 may consist, for example, of plastic<br>
material, or it may also consist of another less resilient<br>
material such as, for example metal. It may be made in such a<br>
manner that said rotary body tensions the needle clamping part<br>
8' against the end 7 of the needle when said rotary body is<br>
rotated about the longitudinal central axis 13 and thus slid<br>
over the outward-located rear surface of the needle clamping<br>
part 8'. In so doing, this longitudinal central axis 13<br>
represents the axis of rotation for the rotary body 41.<br>
As shown by Figure 13, the rotary body 41 may also be<br>
configured as a slim C-clip. This clip is slightly resilient in<br>
radial direction and, in clamping position of the needle<br>
clamping part 8', pushes against the end 7 of the needle. When<br>
the rotary body 41 is rotated away from the needle clamping<br>
part 8', said rotary body releases said needle clamping part.<br>
The needle clamping part can be folded out of the groove<br>
analogously to Figure 10, thus releasing the needle.<br>
Referring to another exemplary embodiment (not<br>
illustrated), the rotary body 41 is configured as a slim<br>
bushing that is slid over the needle clamping part 8' in order<br>
to clamp the needle clamping part 8' in place the longitudinal<br>
direction of the needle. To do so, the groove 40 is wider in<br>
axial direction, so that sliding the rotary body or the sliding<br>
body 41 becomes possible. For the release of the needle<br>
clamping part 8', the sliding body 41 is slid in the direction<br>
of the needle rod 37 until the needle clamping part 8' can be<br>
folded open.<br>
All the above-described embodiments, together, have in<br>
common that a needle clamping part 8, 8' - that is movable in<br><br>
whatever way, in particular, pivotable - is secured in clamping<br>
position by means of a fixing element 14, in which case the<br>
fixing element 14 is supported so as to be rotatable or<br>
pivotable about a rotational axis or pivot axis 16 or 13, said<br>
axis coinciding with the longitudinal central axis of the<br>
needle or being oriented parallel thereto. As a result of this,<br>
simple and rapid handling is possible.<br>
A quick-release clamping holder for a sewing needle,<br>
embroidery needle or the like has a needle receptacle 2 on<br>
which a needle clamping part 8 is preferably pivotally<br>
supported. A fixing element 14 is provided in order to clamp<br>
and fix the needle clamping part 8 in place, whereby said<br>
fixing element is pivotally or rotatably supported relative to<br>
a longitudinal central axis 13 of the needle and thus can be<br>
slid onto and off the needle clamping part 8. Actuation is<br>
simple and safe.<br><br>
