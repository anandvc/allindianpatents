COMPRESSOR INLET DUCT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an inlet duct for a compressor or<br>
supercharger.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Compressors or superchargers may be mounted to an internal combustion<br>
engine to increase the performance thereof. The compressor is operable to induct air<br>
through an inlet duct to interleaved and counter-rotating first and second rotors. The first<br>
and second rotors cooperate to increase the volume of air communicated to the internal<br>
combustion engine, thereby increasing the volumetric efficiency of the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An inlet apparatus for a compressor having a housing defining a<br>
generally C-shaped inlet opening and a rotor cavity configured to contain interleaved,<br>
counter-rotating first and second rotors is provided. The inlet apparatus includes an<br>
inlet duct positioned upstream of the compressor and defining an inlet opening and a<br>
generally C-shaped outlet opening. The inlet duct has an inner wall defining a cavity<br>
operable to communicate airflow between the inlet opening and the generally C-shaped<br>
outlet opening of the inlet duct. The generally C-shaped outlet opening of the inlet duct<br>
is substantially similar to the shape of the generally C-shaped inlet opening of the<br>
housing. The inner wall includes a floor portion and a roof portion each extending<br>
from the inlet opening to the outlet opening. At least a portion of the floor is contoured<br>
to impart a velocity component to the airflow complementary to the tangential velocity<br>
of each of the first and second rotors during rotation of the first and second rotors.<br>
[0004]	The inlet duct may further include first and second ridges formed<br>
centrally on the respective floor and roof portions each extending toward the outlet<br><br>
2<br>
opening of the inlet duct. The first and second ridges preferably increase in at least one<br>
of height and width moving toward the outlet opening of the inlet duct. The first and<br>
second ridges are operable to impart a velocity component to the airflow<br>
complementary to the tangential velocity of each of the first and second rotors during<br>
rotation of the first and second rotors.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure 1 is a bottom view of a portion of a supercharger or compressor<br>
having an inlet duct mounted thereto;<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a perspective view of the compressor of Figure 1, with the inlet<br>
duct removed, illustrating a first and second rotor;<br>
[0008]	Figure 3 is a perspective sectional view of the inlet duct of Figure 1; and<br>
[0009]	Figure 4 is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the inlet duct<br>
of Figures 1 and 3, illustrating an alternate position for a bypass passage.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
supercharger or compressor assembly 10. The compressor assembly 10 is configured to<br>
mount to an internal combustion engine, not shown. Those skilled in the art of engine<br>
design will recognize that the compressor assembly 10 can be used to increase the<br>
volumetric efficiency of an internal combustion engine, thereby increasing the<br>
performance thereof. The compressor assembly 10 includes a compressor 12 and an inlet<br>
duct 14. The compressor 12 includes a housing 16 configured to contain internal<br>
components of the compressor 12. The housing 16 is preferably formed from cast metal,<br>
such as aluminum or magnesium. The inlet duct 14 is mounted to the housing 16 via a<br><br>
J<br>
plurality of fasteners 18. The inlet duct 14 may be formed integrally with the housing 16.<br>
The inlet duct 14 is preferably formed from cast metal such as aluminum or magnesium;<br>
however, the inlet duct 14 may be formed from a plastic or composite material while<br>
remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0011]	A throttle body 20 is mounted with respect to the inlet duct 14 and is<br>
operable to vary the amount of airflow, indicated as arrow 22, entering the inlet duct 14.<br>
A bypass assembly 24 is mounted with respect to the inlet duct 14 and is operable to<br>
selectively divert airflow 22 from the compressor 12 during certain modes of engine<br>
operation, such as light load engine operation. The bypass assembly 24 includes an<br>
actuator 26 operable to selectively and variably open a valve 28 disposed within a bypass<br>
passage 30 defined by the inlet duct 14.<br>
[0012]	Referring to Figure 2, and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
shown the compressor 12 with the inlet duct 14 removed. The housing 16 defines an<br>
inlet opening 32. The inlet opening 32 is generally C-shaped in form and is operable to<br>
communicate airflow 22 to a rotor cavity 34. The rotor cavity 34 is defined by the<br>
housing 16 and is configured to contain a first and second rotor 36 and 38, respectively,<br>
therein. The first and second rotors 36 and 38 are interleaved and are rotatably supported<br>
within the rotor cavity 34 by a rotor bearing support 39. The rotor bearing support 39 is<br>
formed integrally with the housing 16. The first and second rotors 36 and 38 counter-<br>
rotate as indicated by arrows 40 and are operable to convey volumes of air from the inlet<br>
opening 32 to an outlet opening, not shown, for subsequent introduction to the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
[0013]	Referring to Figure 3, and with continued reference to Figures 1 and 2,<br>
there is shown a sectional view of the inlet duct 14 of Figure 1. The inlet duct 14 has<br>
an inner wall 42 that defines a cavity 44 operable to convey airflow 22 between an inlet<br>
opening 46 and an outlet opening 48, each defined by the inlet duct 14. The inner wall<br>
42 includes a floor portion 50 and a roof portion 52. Additionally, a sidewall portion<br>
54 interconnects the floor portion 50 and the roof portion 52. A portion 56 of the floor<br>
portion 50 is raised in the area of the rotor bearing support 39, shown in Figure 2, such<br>
that the outlet opening 48 is generally C-shaped and substantially similar to the shape of<br><br>
4<br>
the generally C-shaped inlet opening 32 of the housing 16. As shown in Figure 3, the<br>
portion 56 of the floor portion 50 is raised immediately downstream from the throttle<br>
body 20 and increases in height toward the outlet opening 48. Portions 58 of the floor<br>
portion 50 are contoured to impart a velocity component to the airflow 22<br>
complementary to the tangential velocity of each of the first and second rotors 36 and<br>
38, shown in Figure 2, during rotation of the first and second rotors 36 and 38. For<br>
instances where the inlet duct 14 is formed separately and mounted to the housing 16, the<br>
perimeter of the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14 should be at or within the contour<br>
of the generally C-shaped inlet opening 32 to avoid the potential for turbulence caused<br>
by mismatch between the two components.<br>
[0014]	A first ridge 60 is formed centrally on the floor portion 50 and extends<br>
toward the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14. The first ridge 60 is preferably<br>
formed with a generally triangular cross-section with increasing height and width<br>
moving toward the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14. The first ridge 60 is operable<br>
to impart a velocity component to said airflow 22 complementary to the tangential<br>
velocity of each of the first and second rotors 36 and 38 during rotation of the first and<br>
second rotors 36 and 38. The first ridge 60 is preferably positioned immediately<br>
downstream of the bypass passage 30.<br>
[0015]	Similarly, a second ridge 62 is formed centrally on the roof portion 52<br>
and extends toward the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14. The second ridge 62 is<br>
preferably formed with a generally triangular cross-section with increasing height and<br>
width moving toward the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14. The second ridge 62 is<br>
operable to impart a velocity component to said airflow 22 complementary to the<br>
tangential velocity of each of the first and second rotors 36 and 38 during rotation of<br>
the first and second rotors 36 and 38. Preferably the first and second ridges 60 and 62<br>
are separated, at least initially, to allow the airflow 22 on each side of the first and<br>
second ridges 60 and 62 to equalize; however, the first and second ridges 60 and 62 can<br>
be designed to converge to form a septum at the outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct 14.<br><br>
5<br>
[0016]	In instances where the throttle body 20 is tilted with respect to the inlet<br>
duct 14, the airflow 22 may be biased to one side of the inlet duct 14 by the throttle<br>
body 20. In this case, the inner wall 42 may be shaped to bias the airflow 22 to the<br>
other side to balance the distribution of airflow 22 within the inlet duct prior to entering<br>
the inlet opening 32 of the compressor 12, shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0017]	Referring to Figure 4, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the<br>
inlet duct 14 of Figures 1 and 3, indicated at 14A. The inlet duct 14A has substantially<br>
the same structure as the inlet duct 14, with the exception that a bypass passage 30A is<br>
defined by the inlet duct 14A and extends through the side wall 54 of the inlet duct.<br>
Since the bypass passage 30A does not intersect the floor portion 50, the first ridge 60<br>
may extend from any point between the inlet opening 46, shown in Figure 3, and the<br>
outlet opening 48 of the inlet duct.<br>
[0018]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
