				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of acetonitrile from ethanol over vanadium-alumino-phosphate catalysts. Particularly, this invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of acetonitrile from ethanol over vanadium-alumino-phosphate catalysts via amoxidation. According to the process of the present invention ethanol is reacted with ammonia and air in the presence of crystalline, porous vanadium-alumino phosphates (VAPO) catalyst. The process of preparing the above catalyst has been described and claimed in our copending application number 1459/Del/95.<br>
In the presently known process, acetonitrile can be produced from amination of acetic acid followed by dehydration or dehydrogenation of ethylamine.<br>
The conventional catalysts have been amorphous in nature and not shape<br>
selective catalysts. These catalysts have been employed in mostly fixed bed<br>
reactors. The following patents have discussed the preparation of nitriles of<br>
present interest, e.g. Eur.Pat; Appl. EP 37173 (1981), US Patent 4876348<br>
(1989), US Patent 4603 207 (1986), Eur. Pat 0037123AI (1981), Brit. Patent<br>
77746 (1957), Ger. (East)DDPatent 241903 (1985), US Patent 3981879 (1976),<br>
US Patent 2839535 (1958), US Patent 2510605 (1950), US Patent 2981879<br>
(1976).      In      these	inventions       the      yield       of       nitrite      may<br>
or may not be highly selective. Particularly high-boiling products, CO, C02 were formed, due to the amorphous nature of the catalysts. The high-boiling products create environmental   and    disposal        problems.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop selective and particularly provide an improved process for the preparation of nitriles employing porous active catalytic materials. The other objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of nitriles wherein the formation of CO, C02 and high boiling products are minimized.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides &gt;90% yield of acetonitrile from ethanol by ammoxidation in one step with very high selectivity over VAPO catalysts at a temperature in the range of 350-450oC and weight hourly space velocity in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 per hour.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of acetonitrile from ethanol over vanadium-alumino-phosphate catalysts which comprises passing a feed consisting of ethanol, ammonia, water and air over a Vanadium alumino phosphate (VAPO) catalyst at a temperature in<br>
o<br>
the range of 300-450*JO and weight hourly space velocity of liquid products in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 per hour and recovering the acetonitrile by conventional methods.<br>
The molar ratio of ethanol and ammonia may be in the range of 1:1 to 1:20. The feed ratio of air may be in the range of 30 to 100 cc/hour.<br>
The catalysts are prepared in general in the following way AI2(S04)3, H3P04 with or without NaCI, V205 and tetrapropyl ammonium bromide (TPA) used as a template mixed in distilled water in the pH range of 7 to 12.0. The slurry      is     mixed    for   at least 2 hours at room temperature with constant<br>
stirring and the pH is adjusted by aqueous ammonia. The slurry was put into an autoclave for autoclaving under autogeneous pressure in the tempera' ure range of 150 to 220° C for 24 hrs to 80 hrs till complete crystallization was achieved. The mixture was filtered and wash with distilled water.The solid catalyst was dried in oven at l70° C over night. The organic template was removed by the activation of the catalyst at 500-550° C for 5-15 hrs. Then the calcined material was modified by promoters like Sb203 or oxides of the elements active as promoters in the respective reactions. Basically in aluminophosphate molecular sieves the Al : P atomi- ratio is 1:1. We have substituted P partially by V as dipgused and claimed in the copending patent number : 1459/Del/95. Al also may be substituted partially by V with  the   corresponding  variation   in  the   atomic   ratio.<br>
The above s a i  reactions were carried out in a tubular,down-flow, pyiex reactor with 20 mm internal diameter. The reaction mixture was fed from top using syringe pump(Sage Instruments,USA). The product was cooled by using ice-cooled water and collected at -he bottom. The required number of ice-cooled traps were used to collect the total amount of products. The products were analysed by using SE-30 (5%) and OV-17 columns.The  analysis  was  confirmed by mass   spectra  and GC-mass.<br>
The   reaction   of   -=-hanol   with   ammonia   in   the   presence   of air    (or   oxygen)    was   carried   out   over   VAPO(TPA-B),    VAPO(TPA-C), VAPO(TPA-D).   The   temperature   was   varied   from   250   to   420°   C.   The higest   yield   of   acet :r. i t rile   obtained   was    &gt;83.0   wt%   over VAPO(TPA)    at   350°  C   ammoxidation   in  one   step.<br>
The   following   examples   are   given   to   illustrate   the process   of   the   present   invention,however,    these   should   not   be construed  to   limit   the   scope  of  invention.<br>
EXAMPLE   -   1<br>
0.78 gm of Ethanol, 1.0 gm of water per hour,0.228 gm ( 30 cc per min)of ammonia and 30.0 cc per min air over VAPO(TPA-B) at 350° C and 0.5 hr weight hourly space velocity of liquid feed. The ethanol to ammonia mole ratio was 1:5. The one step ammoxidation of ethanol was highly selective. No deactivation weis<br>
observed for more than 6 hrs time on stream. The template TPA (tetra propyl ammonium bromide) was removed before the rection. The yield of acetonitrile  was  24.9  wt%   based  on ethanol at 62.3 wt% conversion of ethanol.<br>

The ethanol to ammonia mole ratio was 1:5. The one step ammoxidation of ethanol was highly selective. No deactivation was observed for more than 6 hrs time on stream. The template TPA (tetra propyl ammonium bromide) was removed before the rection. The yield of acetonitrile was 52.9 wt% based on ethanol at 54.0 wt% conversion of ethanol.<br>
