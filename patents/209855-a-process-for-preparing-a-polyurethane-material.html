Among these, the preferred diamine curing agent is 4,4'-methylenebis(3-chloro-2,6-diethylaniline), (Lonzacure* M-CDEA), which is also available from Air Products and Chemical, Inc. (Allentown, Pennsylvania). The foregoing diamine curing agents may be used in addition to or in place of DETDA, as a polyurethane curing agent. Preparation of the Invention<br>
The polyurethanes of this invention can be prepared by quasi-prepolymer or full prepolymer methods, both of which are well known in the art. The preferred method of preparing the polyurethanes according to the invention is as follows: The diisocyanate is first mixed with the OH-containing intermediate in an equivalent ratio of about 2.5 to 4.0 NCO/1.0 OH, preferrably about 3.0 NCO/1.0 OH, and then reacted at 212Â° to 230Â°F for a period of 3 to 5 hours, or 260Â° to 265Â°F for 5 to 10 minutes, or 275Â° to<br>
290Â°F for 3 to 5 minutes. The heat source is then removed, the prepolymer is cooled to about 160Â°F and allowed to stabilize at that temperature for about 24 hours prior to determining the percent NCO in the prepolymer. Additional diisocyanate can then be added to achieve an exact equivalent weight. The prepolymer is then reacted at about 160Â°F to 180Â°F with the<br>
aromatic diamine curing agent in an equivalent ratio of about 0.85 to 1.02 NH2/1.0 NCO, preferrably about 0.90 to 1.0 NH2/1.0 NCO, and more preferrably about 0.92 to 0.96 NH2/1.0 NCO. The polymer is then cured at 230-2750F for 4 to 24 hours. The curing time is longer at lower temperatures and shorter at higher temperatures.<br>
The polyurethane polymers of this invention can be cast or compression molded. Casting is the preferred method because it produces a polyurethane polymer with optimal optical characteristics.<br>
The prepolymer and curing agent mixture is cast into a mold prior to curing. The polyurethane material according to the invention may also be partially cured, by selecting an appropriate curing time and temperature, and then removed from the casting molds and formed into the desired shape. Using this process, the polyurethane material can be formed into a simple or complex shape and then subsequently fully cured.<br>
A triol may be added to the prepolymer in an amount sufficient to produce about one percent cross-Unking based upon equivalents of reactants, for example 4 to 8% by weight based on total reactants. Triols that are useful in the present invention include trimethylol ethane and<br>
trimethylol propane. The addition of a triol to the prepolymer increases the heat distortion temperature and in some cases improves the ballastic properties of the cured polyurethane.<br>
Various anti-oxidants, ultraviolet stabilizers, color blockers, optical brightners, and mold release agents may be used in the preparation of the polyurethanes of this invention. For example, one or more anti-oxidants may be added to the prepolymer in an amount of up to 5% by weight based on total reactants. Anti-oxidants that are useful in the present invention include those of the multifunctional hindered phenol type. One example of a multifunctional hindered phenol type anti-oxidant is Irganox 1010, available from Ciba Geigy, which has the following chemical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A UV-stabilizer may also be added to the prepolymer, either prior to or during the curing step, in an amount up to about 5.0%, preferrably about 0.5 to 4.0% by weight based on total reactants. UV-stabilizers that are useful in the present invention include benzotriazoles. Examples of benzotriazole UV-stabilizers include Cyasorb 5411 and Tinuvin 328. Cyasorb 5411, available from American Cyanamid, has the following chemical formula: (Formula Removed)<br>
Tinuvin 328, available from Ciba Geigy, has the following chemical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Another UV-stabilizer that may be used is Cyasorb 3604, available from American Cyanamid, which has the following chemical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In addition to the benzatriazoles, a hindered amine light stabilizer may be added to further enhance UV protection. An example of a hindered amine light stabilizer is Tinuvin 765, available from Ciba-Geigy, which has the following chemical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
EXAMPLES I-VII<br>
A cycloaliphatic diisocyanate is mixed with one or more polyester glycols, polycaprolactone glycols, polyether glycols, or polycarbonate glycols. The reactants are then heated to 275Â°F to 290Â°F under dry nitrogen, held at that temperature for 3 to 5 minutes, and allowed to react to form a prepolymer. The prepolymer is cooled to 220Â° to 250Â°F, and the<br>
UV stabilizer, anti-oxidant, color blocker, and/or optical brightener are added. The prepolymer is further cooled to 170Â° to 200Â°F and then evacuated and stored for 24 hours at 160Â°F. The percent NCO is then determined.<br>
The prepolymer is then reacted at about 160Â°F to 180Â°F with an<br>
aromatic diamine curing agent in an equivalent ratio of 0.85 to 1.02 NH2 to 1.0 NCO. The polymer is then cured at 230Â° to 275Â°F for 4 to 24 hours.<br>

Amounts of Ethacure 100S (DETDA) are given in the number of equivalents Nrh per 1.0 equivalent NCO as determined in the prepolymer.<br>
The resulting materials are evaluated for their optical, hardness, solvent resistance, heat distortion, and ballistic properties.<br>
