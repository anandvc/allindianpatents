				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in a<br>
spinning machine for condensing a fibre strand, comprising a<br>
front roller pair which borders the condensisng zone of a<br>
drafting unit, and which comprises a driven bottom roller and a<br>
pressure roller, comprising a condensing zone arranged<br>
downstream of the drafting zone, comprising an air-permeable<br>
transport belt which transports the fibre strand through the<br>
condensing zone, comprising a suction channel arranged to the<br>
condensing zone which suction channel guides the transport belt<br>
on a sliding surface, compprising a suction slit located in the<br>
sliding surface, comprising a nipping roller which borderl the<br>
end of the condensing zone and which is pressed to the sliding<br>
surface, comprising a deflecting roller which tensions the<br>
transport belt and also comprising drive elements coupled to the<br>
bottom roller for the transport belt.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When a drafted fibre strand is imparted a spinning twist<br>
directly downstream of the front roller pair of the drafting<br>
unit, a so-called spinning triangle occurs at the nipping line of<br>
2/<br>
the front roller pmir. This comes about because the drafted fibre<br>
strand leaves the drafting unit having a certain width and is<br>
twisted to a thread having a relatively small diameter. The<br>
spinning triangle comprises lateral fibres, which are not<br>
properly bound into the twisted thread and thus contributes<br>
little or nothing to the tensile strength of the spun thread. In<br>
recent times, a condensing zone has been arranged downstream of<br>
the drafting zone of a drafting unit, which condensing zone is<br>
in turn bordered by a nipping line. Only downstream thereof is<br>
the thread imparted its spinning twist. The fibres are bundled or<br>
condensed in the condensing zone, whereby the fibre strand is so<br>
narrow when it leaves the nipping line furthest downstream that<br>
the feared spinning triangle does not occur. The spun thread is<br>
then more even, tear-resistant and less hairy.<br>
A device of the above mentioned type for condensing a fibre<br>
strand is prior art in Gernman published Patent Application<br>
199 03 113. In this known device, the drive of the transport belt<br>
is derived from the bottom roller of the front roller pair via a<br>
plurality of friction stages. The pressure roller is driven by<br>
the bottom roller, against which is pressed the pressure roller<br>
is in turn connteted via a drive bait to the nipping roller which<br>
borders the condensing zone at its exit side. The nipping rollerf<br>
which presses the transport belt to the sliding surface of the<br>
suction channel, in turn drives the transport belt by means of<br>
friction.<br>
DE 19837181 Al corresponds to US 6185790 B 1 which discloses<br>
how the transport belt is driven. At the known device the<br>
transport belt is wrapped around the bottom roller of the<br>
drafting unit and, therefore, directly driven by this bottom<br>
roller.<br>
The disadvantage of the known drive is the fact that the<br>
nipping roller must be pressed with a minimum pressure to the<br>
transport belt in order to permit a friction drive, which<br>
minimum pressure is higher than would be necessary for the<br>
function of a twist block. In the combined effect with the<br>
friction of the transport belt on the sliding surface, an<br>
increased wear of the suction channel in the area of the delivery<br>
nipping line occurs.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to divert the<br>
drive for the transport belt from the bottom roller of the front<br>
roller pair while maintaining the pressure of the nipping roller<br>
on the sliding surface only as high as would be necessary for a<br>
twist block.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the prtttnt<br>
invention in that the deflecting roller is arranged in the area<br>
of the bottom roller, the two rollers forming a wedge-shaped gapt<br>
and in that the driving elements comprise an intermediate roller,<br>
which is disposed in the wedge-shaped gap at the bottom roller<br>
and the deflecting roller.<br>
The transport belt is no longer driven at one place by means<br>
of friction at which it slides over a sliding surface, as in the<br>
above prior art, but rather is clamped at the place of its<br>
friction drive between two rotating rollers. The deflecting<br>
roller is hereby sprung against the intermediary roller. As the<br>
deflecting guide and the intermediary roller are rotating in the<br>
same direction, no significant wear occurs at the place of the<br>
drive transfer despite a sufficiently high pressing force. At the<br>
delivery nipping line, the nipping roller* which is now in turn<br>
driven by the transport belt, need only apply the pressure<br>
required for a twist block, so that at the critical place of the<br>
nipping line* the wear of the suction channel is significantly<br>
reduced. At the same time, the power requirement for the drive is<br>
also reduced.<br>
In order that the transport belt is reliably taken along the<br>
intermediary roller, the latter is provided with a suitable<br>
friction coating. It is possible that the intermediate roller is<br>
disposed only on lateral collars of the deflecting roller and<br>
that the transport belt is taken along by the looping angle at<br>
the deflecting roller, however, it is more advantageous when the<br>
transport belt is clamped between the deflecting roller and the<br>
intermediary roller at its drive point.<br>
As it is purposeful to provide the fibre strand in the<br>
condensing zone with a certain tension, the speed of the<br>
transport belt should be somewhat greater than the peripheral<br>
speed of the front roller pair. For this reason the bottom roller<br>
is provided with a collar of increased dimensions, on which the<br>
intermediary roller is disposed. The collar can be an easily<br>
replaceable disc, so that the tension can be adjusted as<br>
required.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become more readily apparent from the<br>
following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings whereint<br>
Figure 1 is 1 part intersectional side view of the<br>
arrangement according to the prtstnt invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow 11 of Figure<br>
1 of the actual condensing zone and the drive elements of the<br>
transport belt.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Of a spinning machine1 in particular a ring spinning<br>
machine1 only the end area of a drafting unit 2 in connection<br>
with an arrangement for condensing a fibre strand 1 is shown. Of<br>
the drafting unit 2 itself only a front roller pair 3 as well as<br>
an apron pair 4 arranged upstream thereof and comprising a lower<br>
apron 9 and an upper apron 6 are shown. The front roller pair 3<br>
comprises in turn a driven bottom roller 7 and a pressure roller<br>
8, which, together with the bottom roller 7, forms a front<br>
nipping line 9. The drafting zone of the drafting unit 2 comes to<br>
an end at the front nipping line 9.<br>
In the drafting unit 2 1 sliver or raving 10 is drafted in<br>
transport direction A to the desired degree of fineness in the<br>
known way. Directly downstream of the front roller pair is a<br>
condensing zone 11, in which the draftedt but still-twist free<br>
fibre strand 1 is bundled or condensed.<br>
An air-permeable transport belt 12 is a part of the<br>
condensing zone 11, which transport belt 12 can be tbin fine-<br>
meshed woven belt made of polyamide threads. The transport belt<br>
12 transports the fibre strand 1 to be condensed through the<br>
condensing zone 11 and is guided hereby over a stationary sliding<br>
surface 13. The sliding surface 13 is preferably the outer<br>
contour of a suction channel 141 in which a vacuum prevails1 and<br>
which extends over a plurality of spinning stations. The suction<br>
channel 14 is connected via a vacuum conduit 13 to a vacuum<br>
source (not shown).<br>
In the sliding surface 13 a suction slit 16 is located,<br>
which extends essentially in transport direction A, but slightly<br>
diagonally to the direction of motion of the transport belt 12.<br>
On its inner side in travel direction1 the suction slit 16 has a<br>
so-called gathering edge 17, along which the fibre strand 1 to be<br>
condensed travels and is hereby simultaneously rolled in.<br>
Apart from the sliding surface 13, the transport belt 12 is<br>
also guided over a deflecting roller 18, which is arranged at a<br>
distance from the suction slit 16, extends over a plurality of<br>
spinning stations and which tensions the transport belt 12.<br>
At the exit end of the condensing zone 11 a nipping roller<br>
19 is provided, which presses the fibre strand 1 together with<br>
the transport belt 12 against the sliding surface 13 at a<br>
delivery nipping line 20, and which nipping roller 19 is driven<br>
by the transport belt 12. The delivery nipping line 20 thus<br>
borders the condensing zone 11 and acts simultaneously as a<br>
twist block for the spinning twist to be applied subsequently,<br>
which should not retroact back into the condensing zone 11.<br>
Downstream of the delivery nipping line 20, the spun thread 21 is<br>
produced, which is fed in delivery direction B to a twist device1<br>
for example a ring spindle.<br>
A top weighting arm 22 is 1 part of the drafting unit 2 in a<br>
known way, which top weighting arm 221 in addition to the<br>
pressure roller 8 and the remaining pressure roller (not shown)<br>
of the drafting unit 2, also supports the nipping roller 19. Due<br>
to the very varying loading pressures of the pressure roller 8<br>
and the nipping roller 191 the loading device of the top<br>
weighting arm 22 comprises a pressure spring 23 for the pressure<br>
roller 8 and a pressure spring 24 for the nipping roller 19. The<br>
force of the pressure spring 23 is many times that of the<br>
pressure spring 24.<br>
The driven bottom roller 7, as well aa the remaining bottom<br>
rollers (not shown) of the drafting unit 2 extend in the standard<br>
way in longitudinal direction of the spinning machine and arc<br>
supported in so-called roller stands 23 at suitable distances to<br>
one another; a roller stand 25 is indicated in Figure 2. These<br>
roller stands 25 also support the suction channel 14 and the<br>
deflectng roller 18.<br>
The deflecting roller 18 is arranged according to the<br>
present invention in direct proximity to the bottom roller 7 and<br>
forms a wedge-shaped gap 29 therewith. An intermediary roller 27<br>
is located in this wedge-shaped gap 291 which intermediary roller<br>
27 is also supported in the roller stand 25 and which is disposed<br>
resiliently against the bottom roller 7 and the deflecting roller<br>
18. The intermdiary roller 27 is hereby driven by the bottom<br>
roller 7, which intermediary roller 27 in turn drives<br>
simultaneously1 by means of friction1 the deflecting roller 18<br>
and the transport belt 12 . For this purpose the intermediary<br>
roller 27 is provided with a suitable friction coating 28.<br>
As can be seen in particular in Figure 1, ther1 are two<br>
moving components which rotate in the same direction at the point<br>
of the friction drive1 namely, the intermediary roller 27 and the<br>
deflecting roller 18. As a result1 there is practically no wear<br>
despite the pressing force required for the friction drive. The<br>
nipping roller 191 which in turn is now driven by the transport<br>
belt 121 need only be pressed against the sliding surface 13<br>
in the area of the delivery nipping line 2O with the sufficient<br>
pressure to ensure the desired twist block effect.<br>
In order that the speed of the transport belt 12 for<br>
generating a slight tension on the fibre strand 1 is higher than<br>
the peripheral speed of the front roller pair 3, the bottom<br>
roller 7 is provided in the proximity of the roller stand 25 with<br>
a collar of enlarged dimensions1 which can, for example, be<br>
formed by an exchangeable disc 26. The intermediary roller 27 is<br>
thus disposed only on this disc 26 and is driven by sam,. As the<br>
disc 26 has a somewhat larger diameter in comparison to the<br>
diameter of the actual bottom roller 7, the required tension of<br>
the fibre strand 1 is ensured.<br>
