				<td>The invention relates to a fiber-enriched anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic<br>
composition for the bowel, characterized in that it comprises branched<br>
maltodextrins.<br>
Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (or IBDs) include in particular two<br>
distinct conditions: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. These two<br>
diseases, which are both distinct and related, are characterized by more or less<br>
diffuse inflammatory lesions of the bowel, in particular due to a state of<br>
hyperactivation of the immune system of the bowel, the cause of which is<br>
unknown.<br>
Their expression is essentially in the digestive system, with diarrhea,<br>
abdominal pain, loss of weight, and tissue inflammation.<br>
The frequency of IBDs has been increasing over the past few decades. This is<br>
partly explained by the technical progress made, allowing the diseases to be<br>
more readily diagnosed, but it especially appears that the change in dietary<br>
habits is involved in the evolution of these diseases, just like food allergies,<br>
obesity and other "diseases of civilization".<br>
For some time, there has been considerable interest in the combination of<br>
suitable diets with more conventional therapeutic treatments.<br>
Prebiotics and probiotics are more particularly studied for being part of the<br>
dietetics of individuals affected by these pathologies, making it possible to<br>
improve their quality of life and to play an important role with regard to the<br>
preventive aspect of these disorders.<br>
More particularly, it is recognized that the introduction of appropriate fiber into<br>
the diet has a beneficial effect on the health, this fiber exerting a protective<br>
2<br><br>
effect in inflammations of the colon.<br>
This fiber is generally divided up into two categories: soluble fiber and<br>
insoluble fiber.<br>
Soluble fiber, such as pectin and inulin, which cannot be digested by the<br>
enzymes in humans, is fermented by the intestinal bacterial flora. This<br>
fermentation releases short-chain fatty acids in the colon, the effect of which is<br>
to reduce the pH thereof and, consequently, to limit the development of<br>
pathogenic bacteria.<br>
Insoluble fiber, such as cellulose, resistant starches, corn fiber (spent grain) or<br>
soya fiber, has an essentially mechanical role in the gastrointestinal tract. It is<br>
only very slightly fermented by the intestinal flora and contributes to reducing<br>
the intestinal transit time through a ballast effect.<br>
It results from the numerous studies tending to demonstrate the importance of<br>
the diet in the prevention of colon inflammation, that a relationship exists<br>
between complex sugars (polysaccharides, starch) and good colon physiology.<br>
It is, in particular, the resistant starches, which are not digested in the small<br>
intestine, which are of great value for the health of the colon.<br>
However, a lot of work remains to be accomplished in order to modify the<br>
resistant-starch composition of foods without changing the organoleptic<br>
properties thereof.<br>
Since 1997, Kanauchi et al. have described the effects of food products based<br>
on germinated barley on colitis or diarrhea induced in laboratory animals (in<br>
Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997, 61, 449-454 and in J. Gasteroenterol. 1998,<br>
33, 179-188).<br>
3<br><br>
However, over the past few years, the specialists in these pathologies have<br>
turned rather toward "colonic foods", and more particularly prebiotics.<br>
These prebiotics are defined as fertilizers for bacteria beneficial for the health<br>
which colonize the colon.<br>
Prebiotics are functional ingredients present in many edible plants and in many<br>
food products.<br>
The compounds conventionally categorized as prebiotics are<br>
fructooligosaccharides and transgalactooligosaccharides, but also lactulose,<br>
isomaltooligosaccharides, oligosaccharides extracted from soya, xylooligo-<br>
saccharides, etc.<br>
The targets of their functional effects are the colonic flora which ferment them<br>
and for which they serve as specific and selective substrates, the<br>
gastrointestinal physiology, and in particular the functions performed by the<br>
large intestine, the immune system, the bioavailability of minerals, and lipid<br>
metabolism.<br>
Among the beneficial colonic flora whose growth is promoted by prebiotics,<br>
mention is especially made of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.<br>
Lactobacilli have the advantage of bringing about a reduction in the pH of the<br>
medium by the production of lactic acid, this reduction in pH preventing the<br>
growth of pathogenic flora such as proteobacteria or enterobacteria, which are<br>
causal agents of pathologies such as Crohn's disease or certain forms of<br>
ulcerative colitis.<br>
Bifidobacteria are in particular described for their production of enzymatic<br>
4<br><br>
activities of glucosidase type, which promote the release of flavonoids having<br>
antimutagenic and antioxidant effects.<br>
Inflammatory diseases and the respective treatment thereof are the subject of<br>
active research. Experimental models of induction of colitis have been<br>
developed, such as the induction of colitis through the administration of a<br>
solution containing an allergen (TriNitroBenzene Sulfonate or TNBS) in<br>
ethanol in laboratory rats or mice.<br>
The ethanol makes it possible to destroy the barrier formed by the intestinal<br>
mucosa and thus promotes penetration of the TNBS into the intestinal wall, this<br>
TNBS causing acute, often transmural, necroses, probably due to oxidative<br>
damage.<br>
This model is envisioned for studies of localized hypersensitivity of the colon,<br>
and is particularly suitable due to the fact that the inflammations caused by this<br>
model are sensitive to the medicaments administered in the case of IBDs.<br>
Several anti-inflammatory compositions for the bowel have been proposed and<br>
tested by virtue of this animal model.<br>
Fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) are polymers of short-chain fructose units<br>
which are not hydrolyzed in the small intestine in humans, but are degraded by<br>
the resident flora of the colon.<br>
FOSs mainly induce the growth of endogenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria<br>
of the bowel in humans and animals.<br>
In addition, FOS fermentation induces a decrease in the pH of the colon,<br>
induces the production of volatile fatty acids and lactates, and secondarily<br>
increases the production of butyrates.<br>
5<br><br>
In their review published in 2003 in the American Society for Nutritional<br>
Sciences, vol 133, 21-27, C. Cherbut et al. describe the preventive effect of<br>
FOSs in the bowel inflammation induced by TNBS in laboratory rats.<br>
The protective effects of FOSs are measured by monitoring of the macroscopic<br>
score for colon damage (visual search for necroses and ulcers caused by the<br>
TNBS) and measurement of the myeloperoxidase activity (specific enzyme of<br>
polymorphonuclear neutrophil granules, marker for bowel inflammation).<br>
It is thus shown in this article that FOSs significantly reduce bowel<br>
inflammation, making it possible to limit the damage in the bowel (necroses<br>
and ulcers), decrease myeloperoxidase activity and also decrease the weight<br>
loss induced by TNBS.<br>
Moreover, C. Cherbut et al. also demonstrate that FOSs indeed have a prebiotic<br>
effect, i.e. are capable of stimulating the intestinal growth of beneficial bacteria<br>
in the colon, in the case in point lactic acid bacteria and butyric acid bacteria,<br>
which results in a decrease in the pH of the colon.<br>
The mechanism of protection of FOSs is not clearly explained.<br>
It has been proposed, in patent application US 2004/0219157, that FOSs<br>
stimulate the homeostasis of nonspecific immunological parameters and<br>
stimulate the growth of lymphocyte subpopulations.<br>
It is also assumed that lactic acid bacteria, the growth of which is stimulated by<br>
FOSs, are antagonists of pathogenic bacteria, of which they block the<br>
development through the production of antimicrobial substances and by<br>
reducing the pH of the colon.<br>
6<br><br>
Lactic acid bacteria can also adhere to the intestinal walls and thus prevent<br>
colonization by these same pathogenic bacteria.<br>
Moreover, FOSs also act on the decrease in the pH of the colon through the<br>
induced production of lactic acid and butyric acid.<br>
However, this intestinal acidosis effect does not have only advantages.<br>
In international patent application WO 04/026316, it is in fact described that<br>
this acidosis, particularly promoted by the growth of lactic acid bacteria,<br>
ultimately causes an erosion of the colonic mucosa, increasing the risk of<br>
ulcerative colitis.<br>
Moreover, the accumulation of lactic acid in the colon can also result in the<br>
release of excess amounts in the blood, thus causing metabolic acidosis.<br>
Inulin, but also FOSs, have the drawback of being fermented too rapidly in the<br>
colon, and can thus lead to imbalances in the microbial population which are<br>
detrimental to their protective effect on the colon.<br>
In order to counterbalance this harmful effect, it is proposed, in said patent<br>
application WO 04/026316, to combine with the FOSs a polysaccharide<br>
characterized by its slow fermentation in the colon, in the case in point<br>
polydextrose.<br>
Polydextrose is synthesized by random polymerization of glucose in the<br>
presence of sorbitol and of an appropriate acidic catalyst (such as citric acid)<br>
and at high temperature.<br>
Polydextrose is widely used in nutrition as a bulking agent and as a low-calorie<br>
ingredient. Polydextrose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine<br>
7<br><br>
and a considerable portion is found in the feces.<br>
Patent application WO 04/026316 especially teaches the use of polydextrose<br>
for preventing the acidosis effects induced by the imbalances caused in the<br>
microbial population of the colon, in particular by those induced by prebiotic<br>
agents such as inulin and FOSs.<br>
Polydextrose is thus thought to promote the consumption of lactic acid by<br>
specific flora, counterbalancing its overproduction induced by FOSs.<br>
It results from all the above that, to the applicant company's knowledge, no<br>
single polysaccharide composition exists which meets all the requirements of<br>
an effective protective composition for the bowel.<br>
The objective of the present invention is therefore to remedy the drawbacks of<br>
the prior art.<br>
The applicant company has thus found that the incorporation of branched<br>
maltodextrins advantageously makes it possible to reconcile all the objectives<br>
that up until now have been reputedly irreconcilable, by imagining and<br>
developing, at the cost of numerous research studies, a novel fiber-enriched<br>
anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition for the colon, which satisfies<br>
all the abovementioned criteria, namely a protective effect on the colonic<br>
mucosa, a moderate reduction in the pH of the colon, and a favored production<br>
of propionic and butyric acid bacteria, and, to a lesser extent, of lactic acid<br>
bacteria.<br>
A subject of the invention is therefore branched maltodextrins having between<br>
15% and 35% of 1 → 6 glucosidic linkages, a reducing sugar content of less<br>
than 20%, a polymolecularity index of less than 5 and a number-average<br>
molecular mass Mn at most equal to 4500 g/mol, for their use in a method of<br>
8<br><br>
therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, the term "branched maltodextrins" is intended<br>
to mean the maltodextrins described in patent EP 1.006.128, of which the<br>
applicant company is the proprietor.<br>
All the compositions of branched maltodextrins described in patent EP<br>
1.006.128 are suitable for the preparation of anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic<br>
compositions for the bowel according to the invention.<br>
According to a preferred variant, said branched maltodextrins have a reducing<br>
sugar content of between 2% and 5%, and a number-average molecular mass<br>
Mn of between 2000 and 3000 g/mol.<br>
The branched maltodextrins have a total fiber content of greater than or equal<br>
to 50% on a dry basis, determined according to AOAC method No. 2001-03<br>
(2001).<br>
A subject of the invention is a fiber-enriched composition for the therapeutic<br>
treatment of the human or animal body, characterized in that it comprises the<br>
branched maltodextrins as active ingredient.<br>
The fiber-enriched anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition for the<br>
bowel according to the invention comprises 0.5% to 20%, preferably 5% to<br>
10% by dry weight of said branched maltodextrins so as to constitute a<br>
sufficient supply of fiber and protective effect for the colon.<br>
Below 0.5% by weight of branched maltodextrins in the anti-inflammatory<br>
and/or analgesic composition for the bowel in accordance with the invention,<br>
the supply of fiber is insufficient to have a detectable effect.<br>
9<br><br>
These branched maltodextrins have an indigestibility characteristic which<br>
results in their assimilation in the small intestine being prevented.<br>
They provide a source of indigestible fiber beneficial for the metabolism and<br>
for the intestinal equilibrium.<br>
Their high content of 1-6 glucosidic linkages in fact confers on them prebiotic<br>
properties which are entirely specific: it has in fact emerged that butyrogenic,<br>
lactic acid or propionic acid bacteria metabolize these highly branched<br>
compounds.<br>
These branched maltodextrins also promote the development of bifidogenic<br>
bacteria, to the detriment of undesirable bacteria, and thus also promote the<br>
expression of a- and β-glucosidase activities.<br>
The anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition for the bowel in<br>
accordance with the invention makes it possible to stimulate by a factor of 2 to<br>
10, preferably 3 to 8, the a- and P-glucosidase enzymatic activities of the<br>
caecal content and of the stools, as will be exemplified hereinafter.<br>
This results in properties which are entirely beneficial to the health of the<br>
consumer.<br>
Furthermore, the consumption of the branched maltodextrins of the anti-<br>
inflammatory and/or analgesic composition in accordance with the invention<br>
by the microorganisms of the colon will result in the pH of the cecal, intestinal<br>
and fecal content being reduced by 0.5 to 1 unit, thereby reflecting a balanced<br>
growth of said microorganisms.<br>
The use of the anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition according to the<br>
invention also makes it possible to increase the production of volatile organic<br>
10<br><br>
acids in the cecum, which organic acids are chosen from the group consisting<br>
of acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid, preferably propionic acid and<br>
butyric acid.<br>
The protective effect on the colonic mucosa is demonstrated in particular in<br>
animals after administration of TNBS and is reflected by notable results, as will<br>
be exemplified hereinafter.<br>
The animals continue to feed normally, and are significantly protected against<br>
the necrosing inflammation induced by TNBS, as demonstrated by the decrease<br>
in myeloperoxidase (or MPO) activity, assayed in the intestinal epithelium.<br>
In fact, this MPO activity reflects the infiltration of neutrophils into the<br>
phagosomes and the extracellular space, and makes it possible to quantify the<br>
inflammatory process with which it is directly correlated.<br>
The anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition for the bowel in<br>
accordance with the invention therefore makes it possible to reduce by from<br>
5% to 40%, preferably from 7% to 35%, the myeloperoxidase activity of the<br>
intestinal epithelium.<br>
This effect significantly reflects the protective effect of said compositions<br>
against bowel inflammation, making it possible to envision the preparation of<br>
anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic compositions for the bowel which improve<br>
the well-being of the patients, both in humans and animals.<br>
It has, furthermore, been found that the branched maltodextrins according to<br>
the invention do not generate osmotic diarrhea, even at large doses.<br>
The osmotic diarrhea phenomenon is observed when low-molecular-weight<br>
fermentable carbohydrates, such as, for example, lactulose and<br>
11<br><br>
iructooligosaccharides, are consumed.<br>
This phenomenon is reflected by an increase in the water content of the stools<br>
in reaction to an increase in the osmolarity of the fecal content, it being<br>
possible for this increase in water content to go as far as the appearance of<br>
diarrhea. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the branched maltodextrins in<br>
accordance with the invention do not cause this phenomenon although they are<br>
fermentable.<br>
In the diet, the anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic composition for the bowel in<br>
accordance with the invention can be in a ready-to-use form, or else in the form<br>
of a drink, such as a fruit juice, a soup, or else in the form of yogurts or<br>
incorporated into breakfast cereals.<br>
Said composition can, moreover, be used in animals, and more particularly in<br>
cats, dogs, pigs, rabbits or the other farm animals which are sensitive to bowel<br>
inflammation, animals with a decreased immunity.<br>
This composition can also be proposed for supplementing the diet of<br>
individuals suffering from IBDs, but also for individuals suffering from<br>
irritable bowel syndrome, and individuals suffering from traveler's diarrhea,<br>
and abdominal pain of which the etiology is often unknown.<br>
In terms of pharmacy, an anti-inflammatory and analgesic composition for the<br>
bowel in accordance with the invention can comprise the branched<br>
maltodextrins and at least one other active ingredient, in a proportion which<br>
depends on the nature of the active ingredient under consideration.<br>
This other active ingredient is preferably an anti-inflammatory agent for the<br>
bowel.<br>
12<br><br>
In the treatment of IBDs, for example, two types of treatments can be<br>
proposed:<br>
a treatment using medicaments derived from salicylated compounds, for<br>
instance sulfasalazine or its derivatives, such as 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA),<br>
a treatment based on medicaments of the corticoid family, such as<br>
cortisone or prednisolone.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to a composition as described above<br>
comprising the branched maltodextrins, characterized in that it also comprises<br>
at least one active ingredient chosen from the group consisting of sulfasalazine<br>
and its derivatives and corticoids.<br>
According to a specific embodiment, the invention relates to a composition as<br>
described above comprising the branched maltodextrins, also comprising an<br>
active ingredient chosen from the group consisting of sulfasalazine and its<br>
derivatives, characterized in that the ratio by weight of branched maltodextrins<br>
to weight of sulfasalazine or of one of its derivatives is between 2 and 30.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention relates to a composition as described<br>
above comprising the branched maltodextrins, also comprising an active<br>
ingredient chosen from the group consisting of corticoids, characterized in that<br>
the ratio by weight of branched maltodextrins to weight of corticoid is between<br>
2 and 250.<br>
Typically, a composition according to the invention can be in the form of a<br>
liquid, a powder, a syrup, a suppository, a tablet or a lozenge.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to a kit for the therapeutic treatment<br>
of the human or animal body, comprising:<br>
a) a first composition as described above comprising the branched<br>
maltodextrins; and<br>
13<br><br>
b) a second composition comprising an anti-inflammatory agent for the<br>
bowel.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is a method for treating or preventing bowel<br>
inflammations and/or calming bowel pain, comprising the administration to an<br>
individual of a sufficient therapeutic amount of branched maltodextrins.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is a method for treating or preventing<br>
bowel inflammations and/or calming bowel pain, comprising the administration<br>
to an individual or to an animal of a composition as described above<br>
comprising the branched maltodextrins.<br>
The compositions described above comprising branched maltodextrins may<br>
advantageously be administered to an individual or to an animal in combination<br>
with a second composition comprising an anti-inflammatory agent for the<br>
bowel. During the treatment, the two compositions may be administered<br>
concomitantly or sequentially over time. The method of administration of the<br>
second composition depends on the anti-inflammatory agent for the bowel that<br>
is used.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is a method for treating or preventing<br>
bowel inflammations and/or calming bowel pain, comprising the administration<br>
of the two compositions described in the kit described above, concomitantly or<br>
sequentially over time.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is the use of branched maltodextrins for the<br>
manufacture of a composition or of a kit for treating or preventing bowel<br>
inflammations and/or calming bowel pain.<br>
Among the diseases and the pain that can be treated or prevented, mention may<br>
be made of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
14<br><br>
traveler's diarrhea or abdominal pain. Among the chronic inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases, mention may be made of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<br>
As regards the analgesic role of the composition of the invention, it is estimated<br>
with regard to the expression of PPARy and MOR receptors.<br>
PPARγs (or Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors y) are part of the<br>
family of nuclear receptors. They are in particular activated by fatty acids and<br>
are involved in the transduction of metabolic and nutritional signals in<br>
transcriptional responses. They play a major role in maintaining the integrity of<br>
the intestinal mucosa.<br>
It is known to those skilled in the art that PPARys are greatly involved in the<br>
regulation of inflammation of the colon. They are also expressed in the case of<br>
colon cancers and their activation inhibits cell growth and cell differentiation.<br>
MORs (or Opioid Receptor) are found in the central and peripheral nervous<br>
systems and can be present in particular in the colon. The principal function of<br>
MORs is the analgesic function. The second function is the inhibition of<br>
intestinal mobility. MORs are also involved in the regulation of bowel<br>
inflammation.<br>
As will be exemplified hereinafter, it is remarkable to note that the composition<br>
of the invention makes it possible to increase the activity of the peroxisome<br>
proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-y) by a factor of 1.2 to 3, preferably by<br>
a factor of 1.6 to 2.<br>
Similarly, the composition of the invention makes it possible to increase the<br>
number of μ Opioid Receptors (MORs) by a factor of 1.2 to 10, preferably by a<br>
factor of 2.5 to 7.5, even more preferably by a factor of 4 to 5.<br>
15<br><br>
Finally, said composition is particularly suitable for stressed individuals in<br>
whom the stress manifests itself at the level of the bowel.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly upon reading the following<br>
examples which are illustrative and nonlimiting.<br>
Example 1<br>
Laboratory rats were used to study the effect, in their food, of the compositions<br>
comprising branched maltodextrins of the invention (MDB) or glucose<br>
(control) combined with insoluble fiber (spent corn grain or cellulose) with<br>
respect to the protection of their colonic mucosa after administration of TNBS.<br>
The insoluble fiber (in the case in point spent corn grain) and the MDBs of the<br>
invention are combined so as to mimic the fiber intake from cereal products in<br>
the diet according to the recommendations of the health authorities.<br>
In addition, the spent corn grains were chosen for their richness in terms of<br>
carotenoids and polyphenols (in particular in terms of phenolic acid and ferulic<br>
acid).<br>
The branched maltodextrins of the invention selected in this example have<br>
between 15% and 35% of 1→6 glucosidic linkages, a reducing sugar content of<br>
between 2% and 5%, a polymolecularity index of less than 5 and a number-<br>
average molecular mass Mn of between 2000 and 3000 g/mol:<br><br>

They also have a total fiber content of 90% on a dry basis, determined<br>
according to the AOAC method (No. 2001-03).<br>
64 OFA rats of Sprague Dawley origin are divided up into 8 groups which each<br>
receive, in their food and in their drink, a specific diet whose composition is<br>
given in the following Table I.<br>
The glucose and the branched maltodextrins are present in the drink of the<br>
nutritional intake in a proportion of 5% weight/weight. The cellulose and the<br>
spent grains are present in the food of the nutritional intake in a proportion of<br>
5% weight/weight.<br>

8	MDB		Spent grain		TNBS<br>
After one week of quarantine, during which the animals receive standard food<br>
17<br><br>
and drinking water, the rats consume the food and the drink according to the<br>
diet described in Table 1, for 20 days.<br>
They are then made to fast for 24 hours.<br>
At D2i, the animals are treated by intrarectal injection with the products<br>
specified in Table 1.<br>
The animals of groups 5 to 8 receive an intrarectal injection of 500 μl of TNBS<br>
diluted in ethanol to 40% Gay Lussac, whereas groups 1 to 4 receive an<br>
intrarectal injection of 500 ul of NaCl at 9%o.<br>
The TNBS is injected at the dose of 10 mg/kg of bodyweight and per day.<br>
This dose is known to produce a severe but reversible inflammatory reaction.<br>
The change in the animals' weight is monitored over the 3 days following the<br>
injection.<br>
At d24, the animals are sacrificed by CO2 asphyxia.<br>
The animals are weighed and then, after autopsy, the colon is removed,<br>
emptied and then weighed.<br>
It is subsequently observed with the naked eye and is assigned a Wallace score.<br>
The myeloperoxidase (or MPO) activity is also assayed in the intestinal<br>
epithelium.<br>
This activity reflects the infiltration in neutrophils into the phagosomes and the<br>
extracellular space, and makes it possible to quantify the inflammatory process<br>
18<br><br>
with which it is directly correlated.<br>
The Wallace score is established using the Wallace scale as shown in the<br>
following Table II.<br>
Table II<br><br>
Score	Macroscopic observations<br>
0	No damage.<br>
1	Hyperemia. No ulcer.<br>
2	Hyperemia and thickening of the mucosa. No ulcer.<br>
3	An ulcer without thickening of the mucosa.<br>
4	2 or more sites of ulceration or of inflammation.<br>
5	2 or more sites of ulceration or of inflammation or a site of<br>
ulceration/inflammation extending over more than 1 cm over the<br>
length of the colon.<br>
6 and +	If the damage covers more than 2 cm of the length of the colon, the<br>
score is increased by 1 for each additional cm of damaged tissue.<br>
As regards the assaying of the MPO activity, it requires the colon to be<br>
prepared according to the following protocol.<br>
The fragments of colon are suspended in 6 ml of hexadecyltrimethylammonium<br>
bromide buffer (0.5% of HTAB in a 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). The<br>
fragments thus treated are ground and homogenized using a Polytron for 10 s.<br>
Each sample is treated with ultrasound using a Vibra Cell 500 watts device<br>
from Sonics and Materials Inc., Danbury, Connecticut, USA (converter power<br>
of 500 W, power dissipated at the probe of 30% - i.e. 150 W/cm2, pulser in<br>
position 2 - i.e. 66% of a second).<br>
The sonicates subsequently undergo 3 cycles of freezing-thawing before again<br>
19<br><br>
being treated with ultrasound under the same conditions. The samples are<br>
subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 10 000 g at 4°C.<br>
The supernatant is recovered in order to assay the MPO. The determination of<br>
the MPO activity is based on oxidation of a hydrogen peroxide-dependent<br>
artificial hydrogen donor (guaϊacol), which, in its oxidized form, becomes an<br>
orangey color.<br>
The monitoring of the apparent density at 470 nm and at 30°C gives the activity<br>
values (expressed as absorbance units/minute/gram of colon). All the results<br>
obtained are given in the following Tables III and IV (values expressed as the<br>
mean of the results of the measurements carried out on the 8 animals of each<br>
group ± standard deviation).<br>

The weight evolution shows that, at D20, all the animals have the same weight.<br>
At D21, all the animals lose weight because they have been made to fast before<br>
the intrarectal injection.<br>
At D22, all the animals who have been treated with an intrarectal injection of<br>
9%o NaCl regain a significant amount of weight.<br>
Group No. 8 is the only one having received an inflammation-triggering<br>
administration of TNBS whose weight evolution goes up from D22.<br>
The weight evolution of the animals of groups 5, 6 and 7 goes up moderately<br>
only from D23 and D24.<br>
Since the weight curve for the animals of group 8 is identical to that for the<br>
animals which did not receive TNBS, this indicates that these animals began to<br>
feed again from D21. These animals were therefore protected against the<br>
necrosing inflammation induced by TNBS.<br>

8	3.9 ±2.7	2.76 ±0.37	2.114 ±1.639<br>
This result is confirmed by the determination of the Wallace score. In fact, the<br>
animals having received the compositions in accordance with the invention<br>
with spent grain and TNBS have a Wallace score of 3.9, to be compared with<br>
the mean scores of 5.8, 5.9 and 6.5 obtained for the other groups having<br>
received TNBS.<br>
This mean score of 3.9 indicates a significantly lower level of inflammation for<br>
the animals of group 8.<br>
The results of the colon weight measurements show, first of all, that the<br>
animals having received an injection of TNBS have a heavier colon than the<br>
colon of the animals which were not treated with TNBS.<br>
This phenomenon is in particular due to the edema which invades the mucosa<br>
of the inflamed colons.<br>
The mean weight of the colon of the animals of group 8 remains high compared<br>
with the mean weight of the colons of the animals of the groups which did not<br>
receive TNBS, but it remains the lowest weight of all those of the groups of<br>
animals treated with TNBS.<br>
As regards the measurements of the MPO activities, which were obviously low<br>
for the animals of the groups not treated with TNBS, it appears once again that<br>
it is group 8 which shows the least MPO activities compared with the other<br>
groups of animals treated with TNBS.<br>
22<br><br>
The animals of group 8 are therefore significantly protected against the<br>
necrosing inflammation induced by TNBS.<br>
Example 2<br>
Laboratory rats are used to study the effect of the branched maltodextrins of the<br>
invention (identical to those of Example 1) and of dextrose (control) on the<br>
colon irritation induced by the administration of TNBS in male Wistar rats, and<br>
on their cognitive performances in the aversive light stimulus avoidance<br>
conditioning test.<br>
This test uses the rat's aversion to a brightly lit environment. The principle is<br>
that an animal which suffers is an animal which learns more slowly in the case<br>
of a conditioning test.<br>
Firstly, the rat learns to control its aversive light environment in the case of<br>
operating conditioning: the animal learns to press an active lever (LA) in order<br>
to obtain periods of darkness of 30 seconds as positive reinforcement.<br>
The device also comprises another lever which, when it is actuated, does not<br>
make it possible to obtain light: inactive lever (LI).<br>
The total number of times the active and inactive levers are pressed makes it<br>
possible to evaluate the level of manipulatory activity of the rats.<br>
The acquisition of the learning (discrimination between the two levers) is<br>
evaluated by comparing the number of times each of the two levers is pressed<br>
in the "light" phase (LA vs LI).<br>
48 male Wistar/AF SPF rats are divided up into 4 groups which receive, in<br>
their nutritional intake, a diet made up as described in the following Table V.<br>
23<br><br>
Table V<br><br>
Group	Diet	Nature of the treatment at D17<br>
1	Dextrose (5%)	Ethanol (20%)<br>
2	Dextrose (5%)	TNBS - alcohol (20%)<br>
3	MDB (5%)	Ethanol (20%)<br>
4	MDB (5%)	TNBS - alcohol (20%)<br>
After a quarantine period during which the animals receive a standard food<br>
intake and drinking water, the animals consume a food supplemented either<br>
with 5% of branched maltodextrins of the invention, or with 5% of dextrose,<br>
for 15 days.<br>
At D15, the animals are made to fast for 48 hours.<br>
At D17, the rats are anesthetized and 2 out of 4 groups (groups 2 and 4) receive<br>
an intracolonic administration of 500 μl of TNBS-ethanol at 20% Gay Lussac,<br>
at a rate of 3 mg/kg of bodyweight (i.e. 1 mg per rat - this dose is recognized to<br>
induce pain associated with weak bowel irritation).<br>
From D17 to D23, the animals continue to receive the diets supplemented with<br>
MDBs or with dextrose.<br>
At D22, a cognitive test is carried out: the aversive light stimulus avoidance test<br>
(ALSAT).<br>
The following Tables VI and VII give the result of the ALSAT test applied to<br>
the animals of the various groups. Table VII gives the total number of presses<br>
over the course of the test.<br>

According to Table VIII, only the animals having received the MDB of the<br>
invention, with or without TNBS, are capable of differentiating between the<br>
LA and the LI, by more significantly pressing the LA, thus demonstrating a<br>
positive effect of the product against the pain induced by the TNBS.<br>
At D23, the animals are sacrificed; the colon is removed and examined<br>
according to the score scale given in the following Table VIII.<br>
Table VIII<br>
25<br><br>
Colon<br>

5	Multiple sites of ulcers and of inflammations; size of ulcers ≥ 1 cm<br>
The colons removed from the 4 groups are fixed in Carson's liquid fixative and<br>
observed microscopically.<br>
The following Table IX gives the score for the colons of said various groups.<br>

P = 0.02	2.50 ±0.42	2.10 ±0.41	1.17±0.30	1.00 ±0.36<br>
The statistical analysis (ANOVA) shows that the colon scores for group 3 are<br>
significantly less than those for the rats of group 1 and tend to be significantly<br>
less than those for group 2.<br>
The colon scores for the rats of group 4 are also significantly less than those for<br>
group 1 and tend to be significantly less than those for group 2.<br>
The following Table X gives the result of the examinations by microscopy<br>
carried out on the colons fixed in Carson's liquid fixative (macroscopic scores),<br>
26<br><br>
expressed in average degree of enteropathy (inflammations and<br>
necroses/ulcerations).<br>

The macroscopic scores of Table IX are lower when the animals receive the<br>
MDBs according to the invention, compared with the animals having received<br>
the dextrose (control animals).<br>
This observation is well correlated with the microscopic observation, since the<br>
score of 1.9 was assigned to group 4, whereas it is 2.8 for group 2.<br>
It can therefore be concluded that all the animals show inflammation, but with<br>
different degrees of severity.<br>
The enteropathy is less severe when the animals have received the MDBs<br>
according to the invention, thereby confirming the macroscopic results<br>
previously stated.<br>
These results are to be related to the learning test results demonstrating that the<br>
animals which showed better learning were protected against the pain induced<br>
27<br><br>
by TNBS, demonstrating the analgesic nature of the composition according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Example 3<br>
The protective effect of the branched maltodextrins of the invention (those of<br>
Example 1) against bowel inflammation in piglets is studied by assaying blood<br>
haptoglobin.<br>
Haptoglobin is a plasma glycoprotein (a2-globulin) synthesized by the liver,<br>
capable of binding hemoglobin. The haptoglobin content is measured by an<br>
immunological method using diagnostic kits accessible to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The blood haptoglobin content increases in inflammatory syndromes,<br>
irrespective of the cause. Its kinetics are slow, such that, if its level is high, this<br>
reflects the fact that the inflammation has been present for a certain amount of<br>
time.<br>
In contrast, a decrease in its level in the blood reflects a protective effect on the<br>
inflammation.<br>
The trial is carried out on one group of 128 weaned piglets weighing 7.2 ± 1.04<br>
kg at the beginning of the study, the group being divided up into 4 batches,<br>
each of 32 animals, of the same live weight and sex (16 castrated males and 16<br>
females).<br>
The experimental treatments are the following (for a total period of 77 days):<br>
Batch No. 1: control animals fed with a conventional diet,<br>
Batch No. 2: animals receiving the MDB according to the invention in a<br>
28<br><br>
proportion of 2% by weight of the food,<br>
Batch No. 3: animals treated medically since fed with a food containing two<br>
antibiotics (chlorotetracycline and spiramycin) in a proportion cf 1000 and<br>
400 mg/kg, respectively, during the test period (14 d), then fed once again with<br>
a conventional diet during the remaining period of the trial (15-77 days),<br>
Batch No. 4: animals treated medically since fed with a food containing two<br>
antibiotics (chlorotetracycline and spiramycin) in a proportion of 1000 and 400<br>
mg/kg, respectively, during the trial period (14 d), then receiving MDB<br>
according to the invention in a proportion of 2% by weight of the food during<br>
the remaining period of the trial (15-77 days).<br>
At the end of the trial, blood samples are taken from 6 piglets per subgroup and<br>
the haptoglobin content is determined therefrom (expressed in mg/ml of blood).<br>
The following Table XI gives the results obtained.<br>
Table XI<br><br>

No. 2	Batch<br>
No. 3	Batch<br>
No. 4<br>

The results show that the blood haptoglobin content of the animals fed with the<br>
fiber-enriched anti-inflammatory and analgesic composition for the bowel in<br>
accordance with the invention (batch No. 2) is significantly lower than that of<br>
the animals having received a conventional diet, which thus reflects a blood,<br>
and therefore systemic, inflammation level which is lower than the controls.<br>
29<br><br>
J.n batch No. 4, the result is less than that of the control group, even though it is<br>
not significant. This decrease supports, however, the desired effect, namely a<br>
lower anti-inflammatory status.<br>
Example 4<br>
The effect of the branched maltodextrins of the invention (those of Example 1)<br>
on intestinal fermentations is studied in laboratory rats.<br>
40 OFA rats of Sprague Dawley origin are divided up into 4 groups which<br>
receive in their food intake a diet, the details of which are given in the<br>
following Table XII.<br>
Group 4 receives a food intake supplemented with fructooligosaccharides<br>
(Raftilose® P95 sold by the company Orafti).<br>

After one week of isolation during which the animals receive a standard food<br>
intake and drinking water, the rats consume the food for 36 days.<br>
At D0, the animals are made to fast for 24 hours. The drink is given ad libitum.<br>
At D1, the feces are collected.<br>
The diet described in Table XII is given to the animals.<br>
30<br><br>
At D28, the animals are made to fast for 24 h. The drink is given ad libitum.<br>
At D29, the feces are again collected.<br>
At D36, the animals are sacrificed.<br>
A general macroscopic observation of the organs is carried out. The ceca are<br>
ligatured and removed. The full ceca, the cecal contents and the empty ceca are<br>
weighed.<br>
The pH and the solids of the feces and of the cecal contents are determined.<br>
The enzymatic activities of the feces are also evaluated (α-glucosidase and β-<br>
glucosidase).<br>
The distribution of volatile fatty acids is studied in the cecal content (acetic<br>
acid, propionic acid, butyric acid).<br>
The following Table XIII gives the data concerning the weight of the full ceca,<br>
the weight of the empty ceca, and the pH of the cecal content (expressed as<br>
mean value over 10 animals per batch ± standard deviation).<br>
Table XIII<br><br>

cecum (g)	Weight of the empty<br>
cecum (g)	pH of the cecal<br>

4	8.68 ±1.08	1.44 ±0.21	6.49 ± 0.20<br>
31<br><br>
Table XIII shows that the weight of the full and empty ceca are significantly<br>
higher for the animals receiving 10% of MDB according to the invention or<br>
10% of Raftilose® P95, in comparison with the animals receiving a standard<br>
food intake or one containing 10% of dextrose.<br>
Compared with the control batch, the weight of the full cecum of the animals<br>
receiving 10% of MDB increases by 46%, and by 53% for the animals<br>
receiving 10% of Raftilose® P95.<br>
The weight of the empty cecum, for its part, changes by 30% for the batch<br>
receiving MDB and by 50% for the batch receiving Raftilose® P95.<br>
These results show that the MDB and the Raftilose® P95 increase the weight<br>
of the cecum and therefore of the cecal bacterial mass and also the weight of<br>
the cecal mucosa, thus resulting in a physical protection in the face of an<br>
inflammation.<br>
This table also shows that there is a significant decrease in the pH of the cecal<br>
content for the batch receiving the MDB, thus reflecting a substantial cecal<br>
fermentive activity.<br>
This decrease in pH reflects an increase in acidic molecules in favor of a<br>
decrease in basic molecules which would be more aggressive in nature.<br>
The Raftilose® P95, for its part, does not exhibit these properties, since the pH<br>
of the cecal content does not significantly decrease.<br>
Table XIV gives the data relating to the distribution of the volatile fatty acids<br>
of the cecal content.<br>
32<br><br>
Table XIV<br><br>
Batch	Acetic acid (mg/g<br>
of the cecal<br>
content)	Butyric acid (mg/g of<br>
the cecal content)	Propionic acid<br>
(mg/g of the cecal<br>
content)<br>
1	3.07 ±0.68	2.33 ± 0.97	0.75 ±0.11<br>
2	2.88 ± 0.60	1.97 ±0.63	0.76 ±0.19<br>
3	3.55 ±0.50	2.65 ± 0.67	1.56 ±0.32<br>
4	3.37 ±0.31	2.46 ± 0.56	0.99 ±0.15<br>
This table shows that a food intake supplemented with 10% of MDB brings<br>
about a significant increase in the propionic acid of the cecal content.<br>
This result is also obtained for the batch receiving Raftilose® P95, but in a less<br>
accentuated manner.<br>
No significant difference is apparent for the dosage of acetic acid in the cecal<br>
content.<br>
Table XV gives the data relating to the fecal pH.<br>
Table XV<br><br>
Batch	D1<br>
fecal pH	D29<br>
fecal pH<br>
1	6.38 ±0.34	6.58 ± 0.40<br>
2	6.34 ±0.34	6.59 ±0.29<br>
3	6.37 ± 0.22	6.23 ± 0.47<br>
4	6.29 ± 0.40	6.23 ± 0.47<br>
These results do not make it possible to observe a significant decrease in fecal<br>
33<br><br>
DH in the animals receiving the MDB, although a decrease in the cecal pH was<br>
observed.<br>
On the other hand, the fecal pH decreases for the animals receiving Raftilose®<br>
P95.<br>
Tables XVI and XVII give the enzymatic activities of the feces determined at<br>
D0 and D29, respectively.<br>
Table XVI<br><br>
Batch	α-glucosidase<br>
(Uabs/min/g of feces)	β-glucosidase (Uabs/min/g of<br>
feces)<br>
1	3.23 ±1.17	4.40 ±2.86<br>
2	3.19 ±1.72	3.86 ±2.03<br>
3	3.37 ±1.85	2.55 ± 1.11<br>
4	3.10±1.37	2.94 ±1.19<br>
At D0, there is of course no significant difference observed between the<br>
batches.<br>
Table XVII<br><br>
Batch	a-glucosidase<br>
(Uabs/min/g of feces)	P-glucosidase (Uabs/min/g<br>
of feces)<br>
1	5.62 ±1.24	6.08 ±1.39<br>
2	5.97 ± 2.60	6.74 ±3.38<br>
3	23.09 ±7.29	24.21 ±9.10<br>
4	15.32 ±3.91	9.94 ± 3.05<br>
34<br><br>
At D29, the glucosidase activities are greatly increased by the administration of<br>
10% of MDB. This is also the case for the animals receiving 10% of Raftilose®<br>
P95, but in a less accentuated manner.<br>
In fact, increases of 310% and of 298% are observed for, respectively, oc-<br>
glucosidase and β-glucosidase in the batch receiving the MDB compared with<br>
the control batch, whereas the increases are only 172% and 63%, respectively,<br>
for the Raftilose® P95 batch.<br>
The increases in the glucosidase activities of the feces result in colonic<br>
digestion of the polysaccharide residues present.<br>
This high glucosidase activity can thus lead to a decrease in the bioavailability<br>
of certain polyphenols (important participants in the repair of a colonic<br>
inflammation), and also a decrease in oxidative stress.<br>
Example 5<br>
The effect of the branched maltodextrins of the invention (identical to those of<br>
Example 1) on the production of butyric acid is studied in laboratory rats.<br>
18 Fischer laboratory rats are divided up into 3 groups which receive, in their<br>
food intake, a diet given in the following Table XVIII.<br>
Group 3 receives a food intake supplemented with fructooligosaccharides<br>
(Actilight® sold by the company Beghin-Meiji).<br>
Table XVIII<br><br>
Batch	Food and product tested<br>
1	Food AO4C<br>
35<br><br>
2	Food A04C + 5% MDB<br>
3	Food A04C + 5% of Actilight®<br>
After one week of quarantine during which the animals receive a standard food<br>
intake and drinking water, the rats consume the food stated in Table XVIII for<br>
14 days.<br>
At D14, the animals are sacrificed. A general macroscopic observation of the<br>
organs is carried out. The ceca are ligatured and removed.<br>
The distribution of volatile fatty acids in the cecal content is studied.<br>
The following Table XIX gives the results obtained for butyric acid.<br>
Table XIX<br><br>
Batch	Butyric acid<br>
(mg/cecum)<br>
1	12.6 ±2.5<br>
2	17.5 ±3.0<br>
3	16.3 ±3.8<br>
The amount of cecal butyric acid increases for the animals having received<br>
MDB, which can thus be categorized among the butyrogenic glucidic<br>
substrates in animals.<br>
Butyric acid is an important factor for cell growth and differentiation, thereby<br>
justifying the protective action of the MDB against inflammations of the colon.<br>
Example 6<br>
The effect of the branched maltodextrins of the invention (identical to those of<br>
36<br><br>
Example 1) and of dextrose (control) on the production of various cell<br>
receptors involved in bowel inflammation and analgesia is studied in laboratory<br>
mice.<br>
20 7-week-old Balb/c mice are divided up into 2 groups.<br>
One group receives drink consisting of a solution of 10% of dextrose in<br>
drinking water, the other group receives a solution of 10% of MDB in drinking<br>
water.<br>
The animals receive an unlimited supply of this drink and standard mouse food<br>
for 29 days.<br>
At D29, the mice are sacrificed and the colon is removed and analyzed for the<br>
following markers:<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγs)<br>
μ opioid receptor (MOR).<br>
In order to evaluate the role of the branched maltodextrins of the invention in<br>
the physiological regulation of inflammation, the total RNAs of the removed<br>
colons are isolated using the NucleoSpin® RNA II kit sold by the company<br>
Clontech Laboratories Inc. The total RNAs are reverse transcribed to cDNA<br>
using reverse transcriptase.<br>
The reverse transcription reaction is amplified and quantified by real time PCR<br>
(Applied Biosystems) using a primer for PPARγ and MOR. The results are<br>
expressed in numbers of mRNA molecules per mRNA molecule of the internal<br>
β-actin control.<br>
The following Table XX gives the means of the results obtained following the<br>
assaying of the PPARγs and of the MORs in the colonic mucosa of the rats.<br>

(n=9)<br>
5.02±1.65	8.64±2.42	0.98±0.70	4.34±3.02<br>
A considerable increase in these two factors is observed with the introduction<br>
into the food of 10% of the MDB of the present invention for 29 days:<br>
increase by a factor of 1.72 for the PPARγs<br>
increase by a factor of 4.43 for the MORs.<br>
The results of the batch treated with 10% of the MDB shows significantly<br>
greater amounts than the results obtained for the control batch with 10% of<br>
dextrose (p
The MDB of the invention can thus be an aid to the regulation of a possible<br>
inflammation by maintaining, in particular, the integrity of the intestinal<br>
mucosa.<br>
In fact, the increase in the number of PPARγ molecules indicates that the colon<br>
has a better anti-inflammatory status when the animals have consumed MDB.<br>
The increase in the number of MOR pain receptors is, for its part, synonymous<br>
with a decrease in visceral sensitivity to pain. These results are entirely<br>
consistent with those of Example 2, in which the analgesic role of the MDB<br>
had been demonstrated by an effect on the cognitive behavior of the animals.<br>
