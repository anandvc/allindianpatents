				<td>A KETO OR KETO-EPOXY 5,5,6,7,8,8- HEXAMETHYL HEXA- OR OCTA-HYDRO<br>
NAPTHALENE COMPOUND AND A PERFUMING COMPOSITION<br>
AND PRODUCT COMPRISING IT<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns a keto derivative of 5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-hexahydronaphthalene or a keto-<br>
epoxy derivative of 5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-octahydronaphthalene, as defined in<br>
formula or (F) disclosed further below.<br>
The present invention concerns the use of said compound as perfuming<br>
ingredients, as well as the compositions or articles associated with said compound.<br>
Prior art<br>
Compounds having musky odor notes and capable of imparting interesting olfactif<br>
effect to a composition are of high interest for the perfumery industry, especially if they<br>
possess a well balanced earthy note.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, the compounds belonging to formula (I) or (F), as<br>
defined below, are unknown.<br>
The prior art discloses few examples of useful perfuming ingredients having a<br>
structural similarity with the invention's compounds. However said prior art compounds<br>
differ significantly from the ones of formula (T) or (F) by their structure and by their<br>
organoleptic properties, so that they cannot be considered as anticipating the object of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As examples of said prior art compounds one may cite the ones cited in EP 405427<br>
or EP 664286, which possess an aromatic ring, or yet the ones cited in US 3773836,<br>
which are derivatives of indanone.<br>
The compounds disclosed in US 5077273 and EP 465936 possess a quite<br>
different structure as well as quite different odors. The aim of the present invention is<br>
to provide perfuming ingredients with musky-earthy type odors.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, we have now established that a compound of formula (I) or of<br>
formula (V)<br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and<br>
a)   in formula (1):<br>
n is 1 and the dotted line represents a single bond; or<br>
n is 0 and the dotted line represents a double bond;<br>
or<br>
b)   in formula (I'):<br>
n is 0, the wavy line indicates a double bond and the dotted line a single bond; or<br>
n is 0, the wavy line indicates a single bond, the dotted line a double bond; or<br>
n is 1, the wavy line indicates a single bond, the dotted line a single bond;<br>
possesses surprising odor properties, of the musky-earthy type, which have been found to<br>
be particularly useful and appreciated for the preparation of perfumes, perfuming<br>
compositions and perfumed products.<br>
Amongst the compounds of formula (I) or (F), those of formula (IT) or (II')<br>
wherein the two methyl groups bonded to the carbons marked by an asterisk possess a<br>
trans configuration, and R, n and the dotted line have the meaning indicated in<br>
formula (I);<br>
represent a particularly appreciated embodiment of the invention, due to their remarkable<br>
fragrance and odor substantivity, or tenacity.<br>
Amongst the compounds responding to the formulae cited above, one may cite in<br>
particular, and as non-limiting example, (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexameihyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-<br>
hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one which possesses a very strong and complex odor profile<br>
wherein several nuances are present with the musky-earthy notes typical of the invention's<br>
compounds. Indeed its odor is characterized by an excellent musky and earthy-cellar note,<br>
recalling surprisingly the odor of Tonalide® (5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-2-<br>
naphthyl)-l-ethanone; origin: PFW, Holland), associated with bottom notes of the fruity-<br>
quince, nitro-musk type as well as a slightly animal aspect. The presence of nitro-musk<br>
bottom note is quite surprising for a compound which does not possess an aromatic ring.<br>
Furthermore, it can be added the woody notes, typical of a musk like Cashmeran®<br>
(l,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-l,l,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4-indenon; origin: I.F.F., USA ), are very-<br>
weak, and contribute in a minimal part to the characteristic odor of (6RS,7RS)-<br>
5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-l (2H)-one. The overall<br>
fragrance is also highly substantive on a large number of surface and especially on skin or<br>
on fabrics.<br>
In fact, due to the earthy note and the slightly animal aspect, one may say that the<br>
fragrance of (6RS,7RS)-5)536,7,8,8-hexamemyl-3,4,5)6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-<br>
one is reminding of the odor of Tonalide® with in addition a fruity and nitro-musk<br>
character as well as a slight animal connotation similar to the one of Cashmeran®.<br>
Another example of the invention's compounds is (6RS,7RS)-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-<br>
heptamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one which possesses an odor profile<br>
quite similar to that of the compound mentioned above, but it differentiates from the latter<br>
by the presence of a note of the Ambrette type and a stronger earthy note, which recall<br>
even more the odor of Tonalide® or even that of Vulcanolide® (trans-5,6,7,8-terrahydro-<br>
3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-2-naphthalenecarbaldehyde; origin: Firmenich, Switzerland).<br>
A further example of a compound of formula (H) is (4aRS,6RS,7RS,8aSR)-<br>
5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethylhexahydro-4a,8a-epoxynaphthalen-l(2Fi)-one. Said compound has<br>
a fragrance characterized by musky-earthy and nitro-musk notes in association with pine,<br>
powdery and sweet undernotes. However, this invention's compound differs from the<br>
ones mentioned above by having an earthy connotation weaker than the one of the two<br>
compounds mentioned above. The whole organoleptic profile of (4aRS,6RS,7RS,8aSR)-<br>
5s5,6,7,8,8-hexamethylhexahydro-4aJ8a-epoxynaphthalen-l(2H)-one is in the direction of<br>
the odor of Galoxilide® (another aromatic musk, which is frequently described as having a<br>
sweet-musky odor).<br>
The other isomer of the above-mentioned epoxide, namely (4aSR,6RS,7RS,8aRS)-<br>
5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamemymexahydro-4a,8a-epoxynaph1halen-l (2H)-one, possesses a<br>
fragrance which is more musky but weaker than the one of its isomer.<br>
Amongst the compounds of formula (T) or (II') one may cite, as non-limiting<br>
examples, (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-<br>
one which, in addition to the usual musky and earthy character, possesses also a slightly<br>
woody-pear bottom note.<br>
Furthermore, one may also mention 3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-<br>
hexahydronaphthalen-2(lH)-one which possesses a nice musky, dry and powdery note<br>
associated with an earthy and slightly woody connotation. The overall odor of this<br>
compound is recalling the one of Tonalide® and Galaxolide®.<br>
Finally, the odor of (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-<br>
naphthaIen-2(lH)-one is characterized by a strong and well-balanced earthy musky, musk-<br>
ambrette type note having also a powdery and ambrette's seeds undernote. The whole<br>
odor can be also described as a musky-earthy type in the direction of Galaxolide® and<br>
Celestolide® (l-(6-tert-butyl-l,l-dimethyl-4-indanyl)-l-ethanone; origin: I.F.F., USA).<br>
Therefore, the invention's compounds, despite having a structural similarity to that<br>
of the compounds disclosed m US 3773836, distinguish from the latter by a quite different<br>
organoleptic profile. Indeed, the musk note of the invention's compounds, to the contrary<br>
of those of US 3773836, is characterized by the presence of a more or less pronounced<br>
earthy note wherein the woody note is fairly absent, or quite weak and of the pine type,<br>
rather than of the "precious wood" type, In fact the odor profile of the invention's<br>
compounds is more in the direction of the Tonalide® or Galaxolide® profile, rather than in<br>
the direction of Cashmeran®.<br>
According to a particularly appreciated embodiment of the invention, (6RS,7RS)-<br>
5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-riexaliydronaplithalen-l(2H)-one will be used in<br>
perfumery application in a preferential manner.<br>
The invention's compounds, in a general manner, can be obtained using 5,6,7,8-<br>
tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-naphthalene, in the form of the cis or trans isomers<br>
or a mixture thereof, as starting material. Said heptamethyl-naphthalene derivative can be<br>
optionally demethylated in the position 3, into dro-hexamethyl-<br>
naphthalene, for example using a method as described in the examples. Both 5,6,7,8-<br>
tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-naphthalene and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,6,7,8,8-<br>
hexamethyl-naphthalene can subsequently be partially reduced using a Birch type reaction<br>
or a partial hydrogenation, into the desired hydronaphthalene derivative. The latter is<br>
consequently oxidized into an epoxide, which is rearranged into the corresponding ketone,<br>
or is oxidized in an allylic position to provide a ketone, which is optionally further<br>
epoxidised.<br>
Typical examples of such synthetic schemes are described in the examples further<br>
below.<br>
As the invention's compounds arc valuable perfuming ingredients, the invention<br>
concerns also the use of said compounds as perfuming ingredients. In other words it<br>
concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a<br>
perfuming composition or of a perfumed article, which method comprises adding to said<br>
composition or article an effective amount of at least a compound of formula (I) and/or<br>
(I'). By "use of a compound of formula (I) and/or (I')" it has to be understood here also<br>
the use of any composition containing a compound (I) and/or (I') and which can be<br>
advantageously employed in perfumery as active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming<br>
ingredient, are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound, as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials, for examples, may<br>
comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides,<br>
natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids: Stabilisatoren, Dickungs und Gehermittel in LebensmitteL<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I) and/or (I'). Moreover, by<br>
"perfuming co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming<br>
preparation or composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-<br>
ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person<br>
skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor<br>
of a composition, and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carrier, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol,<br>
water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known<br>
under the trademark Isopar® ongin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether<br>
esters such as those-known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability and etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one invention's compound and<br>
at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well<br>
as a perfuming composition comprising at least one invention's compound, at least one<br>
perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) and/or (I) is important as it<br>
enables the perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various<br>
compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Preferably, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without<br>
an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a<br>
starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound, as defined above; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base,<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents<br>
and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely<br>
perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses,<br>
oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention compound, so that it may. be necessary to protect the<br>
latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.5 % to 50 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 0.05% to 5% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCI3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for H and 90 or 100 MHz for<br>
13C, the chemical shifts 8 are indicated in ppm with respect to the TMS as standard, the<br>
coupling constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>

The addition of 100 parts by weight of (6RS,7RS)-5,536,7J8?8-hexamethyl-3,4,5&gt;6J7,8-<br>
hexanydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one to the above-described eau de toilette imparted to the<br>
latter a powerful musky and earthy connotation, having also a well appreciated aspect<br>
which is slightly ambrette and pine. The overall effect was in-between the one which<br>
could have been brought by the addition of Casbmeran® or Tonalide®, however the<br>
substantivity was by far superior to that which could have been imparted by the addition<br>
of Cashmeran®, and its musky-arnbrette character was more elegant than the one provided<br>
byTonalide®.<br>
The addition of (6RS,7RS)-3,555,6J,8,8-heptamethyl-3&gt;4,5J6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalea-<br>
1 (2H)-one or (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(lH)-<br>

l(2H)-ons, to the above-described eau de toilette provided a more classic fragrance,<br>
wherein Hie earthy-woody effect was more pronounced than the one which could have<br>
been obtained by the addition of Tonalide®.<br>
Finally, the addition of the same amount of (4aRS,6RSI7RS,8aSR.)-5,5,617,8,8-<br>
hexamethy3hexahydro-4a,8a-epoxynapbthalen-l(2H)-one to the eau de toilette described<br>
above imparted a character which was much more powdery, almost nitro-musk, compared<br>
to the one obtained by the addition of (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-3,4,567,8-<br>
hexahydonaphthalen-l(2H)-one.<br>
hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one to the above-described perfuming base provoked, in the<br>
fragrance of the latter, the bursting of a musky, ambery and balsamic symphony,<br>
accompanied by an astomshing warm and sweetness.<br>
However, if there was added to the base the same amount of (6RS,7RS)-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-<br>
heptamethyl-3,4,5,6,7J8-hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one or (6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-<br>
hexamethyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(lH)-one the whole olfactif effect was<br>
closer to. the one provided by Tonalide®. The effect obtained by the addition of<br>
(6RS,7RS)-5,5,6,7,8,8-hexamemyl-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(lH)-one was also<br>
slightly more ambrette than the one imparted by (6RS,7RS)-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-<br>
3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-l(2H)-one.<br>
If instead of the above-mentioned invention compounds there was added<br>
(4aRS,6RS,7RS,8aSR)-5,5,6,7,8,8-he«amethymexahydro-4a,8a-epoxvnaphthalen-l(2H)-<br>
one, the effect imparted was very similar to the one which could have been provided by<br>
the perfuming ingredient known as Musk Ambrette.<br>
