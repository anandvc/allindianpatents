ABBOTT LABORATORIES, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of State of Illinois, United States of America, having its Registered Office at Dept.377/AP6A-1, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064, United States of America.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2006/102451<br><br>
PCT/US2006/010468<br><br>
AMINO ACID COMPOSITION FOR IMPROVING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE<br>
 	FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising select amino acid blends and to methods of using the compositions in individuals afflicted with impaired glucoses tolerance or diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 	Diabetes mellitus  is  a  disorder of carbohydrate metabolism  resulting from<br>
insufficient production of or reduced sensitivity to insulin. In persons who have diabetes, the normal ability of body cells to use glucose is inhibited, thereby increasing blood sugar levels. As more glucose accumulates in the blood, excess levels of sugar are excreted in the urine. Corresponding symptoms of diabetes include increased urinary volume and frequency, thirst,<br>
           hunger, weight loss, and weakness.<br>
There are two variations of diabetes. Typel diabetes is insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for which insulin administration is required. In a subject patient with type I diabetes, insulin is not secreted by the pancreas and therefore must be taken by injection or inhalation. Type 2 diabetes may be controlled by dietary restriction, oral antihyperglycemic agents,<br>
           and/or insulin administration.   Type 2 diabetes can be attributable to dilatory pancreatic secretion of insulin and reduced sensitivity to the action of insulin on-target tissues.<br>
Complications from diabetes often involve the cardiovascular system, which then accounts for the majority of diabetes-related deaths. Other serious complications include diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, and/or frequent infection.<br>
  	Treatment of individuals afflicted with diabetes who are unable to produce insulin in<br>
their bodies involves the administration of regular injection or inhalation of insulin. Insulin derived from the pancreatic extract of pigs, sheep, and oxen can be used for this purpose, although many individuals now use synthetic human insulin manufactured via recombinant DNA technology.<br>
 	One method of treating diabetes involves regulating or limiting calorie and<br>
carbohydrate intake by placing an individual afflicted with diabetes on a restrictive diet designed to facilitate reaching and maintaining normal body weight. While effective in theory, limiting calorie and carbohydrate intake is often difficult, thus often resulting in poor patient compliance.<br>
 	Medications are also used in certain diabetic individuals to help maintain blood<br><br><br>
WO 2006/102451	PCT/US2006/010468<br>
glucose levels within acceptable target ranges. These medications most typically simulate insulin release by the pancreas, improve the body's ability to use insulin, and/or decrease the production of glucose by" the liver. These medications, however, are limited in that each can have limiting side effects, none are appropriate for non-diabetic individuals, and the various     medications often lose their effectiveness in many individuals after prolonged use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INYENTION <br>
The present invention is directed to compositions and to methods of using mose compositions in treating individuals afflicted with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes.<br>
 	 This invention is based upon the discovery that the administration of certain amino acid combinations, in defined amounts and/or weight ratios, result in a surprisingly blunted giycemic response to a carbohydrate load.<br>
One aspect of the present invention includes compositions comprising isoleucine, leucine, valine, cysteine, and methionine, in weight ratios of isoleucine to leucine, isoleucine<br>
 	 to valine, isoleucine to cysteine, and isoleucine to methionine, independently of at least about 10:1.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes compositions for use in treating individuals afflicted with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, wherein such compositions comprise from about 1 to about 200 mg/kg of body weight of isoleucine; from about 0.001 to<br>
           about 10 mg/kg of body weight of leucine; from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of valine; from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of cysteine; and from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of methionine, and wherein the weight ratios of isoleucine to leucine, isoleucine to valine, isoleucine to cysteine, and isoleucine to methionine are each independently at least about 10:1.<br>
 	Another aspect of the present invention includes compositions for use in treating<br>
individuals afflicted with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, wherein such compositions comprise from about 10 to about 200 mg/kg of body weight of isoleucine; from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of leucine; from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of valine; from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of cysteine; and from about 0.01<br>
           to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of methionine.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes low-calorie beverages or other liquids comprising (A) about 2% to about 98% carbohydrate, as a percentage of total calories, including at least one of maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, glycerol, isolmalt, and lactitol, and (B) from about 2% to about 98% of a protein source including any<br><br><br>

Manufacture<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by any known or<br>
 	 otherwise effective manufacturing technique for preparing the selected product form. Many such techniques are known for any given product form such as nutritional liquids or nutritional bars and can easily be applied by one of ordinary skill in the art to the nutritional products described herein.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can likewise be prepared by any known or<br>
 	otherwise effective manufacturing technique for preparing the various pharmaceutical product forms. Many such techniques are known for any given pharmaceutical product form such as capsules, tablets, liquids, and so forth, and can easily be applied by one of ordinary skill in the art to the compositions described herein.<br>
As a basic liquid formulation, the compositions of the present invention may be<br>
 	 prepared by dissolving each of the selected amino acids in water or a dilute acid solution, and then combining the different amino acid solutions to form a liquid embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As a basic solid formulation, the compositions of the present invention may be prepared by combining the different powder forms of the selected amino acids, along with<br>
any tablet forming materials or other excipients, and then dry blending the powders prior to processing it into the desired solid product form, e.g., tablet, capsule, caplet, and so forth.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated as a nutritional liquid, including a juice or milk or soy-based liquid, comprising the selected amino acid blend. Such an embodiment may be prepared by first forming an oil<br>
 	 and fiber blend containing all formulation oils, any emulsifler, fiber and fat-soluble vitamins. Additional slurries (typically a carbohydrate and two protein slurries) are prepared separately by mixing the carbohydrate and minerals together and the protein in water. The slurries are then mixed together with the oil blend.    The resulting mixture is homogenized, heat<br><br><br>
WO 2006/102451	PCT/US2006/010468<br>
processed, standardized with any water-soluble vitamins, flavored and the !:quid terminally sterilized or aseptically filled or dried to produce a powder.<br>
Other product forms such nutritional bars may be manufactured, for example, using<br>
cold extrusion technology as is known and commonly described in the bar manufacturing art.<br>
      To prepare such compositions, typically all of the powdered components are dry blended<br>
together, which typically includes the amino acid blend and any proteins, vitamin premixes,<br>
certain carbohydrates, and so forth.   The fat-soluble components are then blended together<br>
and mixed with any powdered premixes. Finally any liquid components are then mixed into<br>
the composition, forming a plastic like composition or dough. The resulting plastic mass can<br>
      then be shaped, without further physical or chemical changes occurring, by cold forming or<br>
extrusion, wherein the plastic mass is forced at relatively low pressure through a die, which<br>
confers the desired shape. The resultant exudate is then cut off at an appropriate position to<br>
give products of the desired weight.  If desired the solid product is then coated, to enhance<br>
palatability, and packaged for distribution.<br>
 	The solid nutritional embodiments of the present invention may also be manufactured<br>
through a baked application or heated extrusion to produce solid product forms such as<br>
cereals, cookies, crackers, and similar other product forms.   One knowledgeable in the<br>
nutrition manufacturing arts is able to select one of the many known or otherwise available<br>
manufacturing processes to produce the desired final product<br>
 	The compositions of the present invention may, of course, be rnanufactpred by other<br>

EXPERIMENT <br>
The following experiments are directed to the compositions of the present invention, and include the administration of these compositions to rats with impaired glucose tolerance (Fatty Zucker rats) or to rats with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats) and      the subsequent evaluation of the blood glucose response in each animal.<br>
Experiment 1<br>
An amino acid test formula and control are prepared. The control is a 22.5% glucose solution.  The amino acid test formula is prepared by weighing and dissolving each of the<br>
 	 following amino acids in separate tubes: ASP (66.55 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; THR (7.21 mg) is dissolved in 1.0ml of water; SER (7.97 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water, GLU (102.3 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; PRO (8.6 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; GLY (29.15 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml IN HCL; ALA (33.27 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water, CYS (5.28 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml IN HCL; VAL (6.68 mg) is dissolved in<br>
 1.0 ml of water; MET (3.36 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; ELE (7.34 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; LEU (6.58 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; TRY (33.55 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; PHE (20.8 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; HIS (6.9 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL; LYS (11.8 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; ARG (34.38 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; TRP (9.46 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of 1 N HCL.<br>
 Each amino acid additive is contained within in its own individual tube and is mixed within that tube until a clear solution forms.<br>
Among the different amino acid solutions formed, those dissolved with HCL are then combined in a 50 ml beaker, after which 937.5mg of ILE is added to the beaker and mixed until dissolved. Once the ILE is dissolved, all amino acid solutions once dissolved in water<br>
 are then added to the beaker, followed by 25 ml of a 45% glucose solution. The resulting glucose-containing blend is stirred until thoroughly mixed, the pH of which is men adjusted to 7.0 +/- 1.0 with a 50% sodium hydroxide solution (buffer may be added to stabilize pH). The pH adjusted mixture is transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and brought to volume with distilled water.  The mixture is transferred to a beaker with a stir bar and stirring is<br>
     continued while filling syringes.<br>
Fatty Zucker rats are received at the animal facility for at least one week before<br>
testing.    Each is weighed the day before the experiment and then assigned to one of two<br>
  	groups matched for body weight  Only rats that weigh at least 300 gm are included in the<br>
study.  After an overnight fast, each rat is weighed again and men dosed at 8ml/kg body<br><br><br>
WO 2006/] 02451<br><br>
PCT/CS2006/010468<br><br>
weight (oral gavage) with the control or the amino acid test solution. Blood glucose concentrations are then measured from the tip of the tail of each animal at 30, 60,90 and 120 minutes following the gavage.<br>
The data from this experiment are summarized in Figure 1, which shows that the amino acid test mixture, when administered to the rats, significantly reduces blood glucose concentrations relative to the control at 60 minutes following gavage.<br>
Experiment 2<br>
The control formula (22.5% glucose solution) and the amino acid test formula described in Experiment 1 are prepared and subsequently used in this second experiment, along with an isoleucine mixture as described below.<br>
In mis second experiment, a high dose isoleucine mixture is prepared by adding L-isoleucine (1338.7 g) to 50 ml beaker followed by 10 ml of IN HCL. The beaker contents are mixed until dissolved, and thereafter to it is added with agitation 25 ml of a 45% glucose solution. The pH of the resulting mixture is adjusted to 7.0 (+/- 1.0) with a 50% sodium hydroxide solution (buffer may be added to stabilize pH). The pH adjusted mixture is transferred to a 50ml volumetric and brought to volume with distilled water. The mixture is transferred to a beaker with stir bar and continually stirred while filling syringes.<br>
Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, a model of type 2 diabetes, are received at the animal facility for at least one week before testing. Each is weighed the day before the experiment and then assigned to one of two groups matched for body weight. After an overnight fast, each rat is weighed and then dosed at 8ml/kg body weight (oral gavage) with the glucose control, the amino acid test mixture, or the isoleucine solution. Blood glucose concentrations are then measured from the tip of the tail of each animal at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following die gavage.<br>
The data from this experiment are summarized in Figure 2. As shown in the illustrated data, high dose isoleucine (isoleucine alone) does not significantly affect blood glucose concentrations relative to the control, whereas the amino acid test mixture significantly decreases blood glucose concentrations relative to the control at 60 minutes following gavage.<br>
Experiment 3<br>
To determine the minimal amino acid solution needed to improve glycemia, an amino acid mixture is prepared in the following manner (weigh each amino acid and place it into its<br><br><br>
WO 2006/102451<br><br>
PCT/US2006/01046S<br><br>
own individual tube): CYS (5.28 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml IN HCL; VAL (6.68 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; MET (3.36 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water; and LEU (6.58 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of IN HCL. Each tube is mixed until a clear solution is obtained. In a 50 ml beaker, DUE (927.5 mg) is dissolved in 10 ml HCL. All amino acid tubes dissolved 5 in acid are added to the 50 ml beaker (use a pipette to transfer) and stirred. All of the amino acids once dissolved in water are then added to the beaker (transfer via pipette), followed by 25 ml of 45% glucose solution. The resulting blend is stirred until thoroughly mixed. The pH of the blend is adjusted to about 7 with a 50% sodium hydroxide solution. A buffer may be added to stabilize the pH. The blend is then transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and<br>
        brought to volume with distilled water. The resulting mixture is compared to a control solution of 22.5% glucose in the following experiment<br>
Fatty Zucker rats are received at the animal facility for at least one week before testing. Each is weighed the day before the experiment, and then assigned to one of two groups matched for body weight.  Only rats that weigh at least 300 gm are included in the<br>
 	 study. After an overnight fast, the rats are weighed and dosed at 8ml/kg body weight (oral gavage) with either control or the amino acid test mixture. Blood glucose concentrations are then measured from the tip of the tail of each animal at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from the tip of the tail.<br>
The data from this experiment are summarized in Figure 3, which shows that the<br>
 	amino acid test mixture (five amino acid combination) significantly decreases blood glucose concentration relative to the control at 60 minutes following gavage.<br><br><br><br>
