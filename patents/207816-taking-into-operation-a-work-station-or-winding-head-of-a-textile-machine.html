TAKING INTO OPERATION A WORK STATING<br>
OR WINDING HEAD OF A TEXTILE MACHINE.<br>
SAURER GmbH &amp; CO., KG. of LANDGRAFENSTRASSE 45, D-41069, MONCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
768/MUM/2003<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
15-7-2004<br><br>
Method and device for taking into operation station or winding head of a textile manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses.<br>
The invention relates to a method for taking into operation a work station of a textile machine manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses in accordance with the preamble to Claim 1, and a device in accordance with the preamble to Claim 2 respectively.<br>
In connection with the operation of textile machines manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses, in particular automatic cross-wound bobbin winders, it is conventional, as described in DE 40 05 752 Al, for example, in the event of a thread break or the change of a take-off spool, for an automatic thread connection device specific to the winding head concerned to be activated by means of the winding head computer.<br>
This means that in the first instance a suction nozzle is placed on the surface of the winding or take-off bobbin, which is rotating slowly against the direction of winding. Once the end of the top thread has been taken up, the suction nozzle pivots back into its initial position, in which the suction nozzle aperture is positioned beneath a thread splicing device. The thread strand which extends between the cross-wound bobbin or cheese and the suction nozzle is in this situation drawn into an electronic cleaner arranged above the thread connection device, a clamping and cutting device positioned in this area, and, guided by corresponding guide contours of thread guideplates and thread guide bars, and drawn into a cutting device located beneath the splicing device.<br>
Almost simultaneously with the suction nozzle, a grippr tube positioned in a lower initial position pivots into an upper working position, and in this situation brings with it a bottom thread, drawn from the take-off spool and held up to that point, for example, in a thread tensioning device. When the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
gripper tube pivots into its upper operational position, the bottom thread, which is likewise conducted on corresponding thread guide contours, slides into an opened thread clamp as well as into an opened cutting device. Both top and bottom threads are then cut to the correct length, prepared in what are referred to as release tubes, and connected to one another in the thread splicing device. This means that, at the winding heads of an automatic cross-wound bobbin winder, in order to be able to continue operation automatically after a thread break, for example, a top thread recovered from the cross-wound bobbin is always required, as well as a bottom thread corning from the take-off spool.<br>
After a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty bobbin, it must be ensured that the thread deriving from the takeoff spool reaches as far as the range of the empty bobbin being held in the creel of the winding head concerned, and can be secured to this.<br>
The principle is known (DE 195 33 ,833 Al) from spinning machines which are provided with an automatically operating traveller, referred to as a cross-wound bobbin changer, that, in the event of a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty bobbin, the thread strand which is still tensioned between the take-off spool and the completed cross-wound bobbin, is initially taken up by special handling means of the cross-wound bobbin or cheese changer, referred to as a thread lifter, and is then cut off in a defined manner by means of a cutting and clamping device arranged at the thread lifter.<br>
In this situation, the thread end connected to the takeoff spool will be secured and then placed on an empty bobbin newly replaced in the creel.<br>
The devices described heretofore have proved their Value in actual practice.<br>
They do exhibit the disadvantage, however, that they cannot operate in the<br><br>
correct functional manner in the event of a batch change, because in such cases the cross-wound bobbin or cheese changer does not have any thread available which can be gripped.<br>
This means that the thread ends of the take-off spools provided with new yarn material, which are waiting ready in the unwinding positions of the winding heads, are not accessible to the thread-handling devices of the cross-wound bobbin changer.<br>
Accordingly, a method has already been proposed (DE 100 07 950 Al) in which the thread end of a take-off spool positioned in an unwinding position is initially taken up by the gripper tube and laid into the splicing device. The thread is then separated by the bottom thread cutting device of the thread splicing device, whereby the remaining start of the thread falls onto a thread catching device arranged beneath the thread splicing device.<br>
A special bottom thread suction tube then takes up the thread from the thread catching device, and transfers it to a thread clamping and cutting device securely arranged in the area of the creel.<br>
The thread clamping and cutting device positions the thread in this situation in such a way that it can be secured in an empty bobbin held in the creel.<br>
Devices such as are described in DE 100 07 950 Al do indeed allow in principle for automatic respinning even after a change of batch, but the devices are relatively elaborate and therefore expensive.<br>
Taking the previously known prior art as a starting point, the problem of the invention is to develop a method and device which will allow for automatic respinning with the lowest technical effort even in the event of a batch start.<br><br>
This problem is resolved according to the invention by a method such as is described in Claim 1, and by a device according to Claim 2 respectively.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the device the device according to the invention is the object of Claim 3.<br>
The method according to the invention has the particular advantage that no new and expensive conversions or additions are required in the area of the winding heads, but rather that the method according to the invention can be carried out on almost all the "normal" winding heads of a textile machine manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses.<br>
The winding heads need only to be somewhat modified in respect of the software of their winding head computers.<br>
This means that, according to the present invention, as is usual, the thread end of the take-off spool of a new batch, which is, for example located ready at a suction bell;, is taken up by the gripper tube on the winding head side, and pivoted by the gripper tube into the area of a transfer position arranged at a distance to the suction bell.<br>
The suction nozzle, likewise specific to the winding head, is then actuated in such a way that its mouth is positioned just beneath the mouth of the gripper tube waiting in the transfer position.<br>
By means of appropriate imposition of under-pressure on the suction nozzle and simultaneous disconnection of the imposition of under-pressure on, the gripper tube, a transfer than takes place of the thread and from the gripper tube to the suction nozzle.<br>
The thread is then brought by the suction nozzle pivoting upwards into an<br><br>
area in which the thread can be gripped by a corresponding thread handling device of a cross-wound, bobbin changer arranged in a movable manner above the winding heads.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin changer takes up the thread, for example with what is referred to as a thread raiser, and conveys it into the area of the creel, where the thread is, for example, clamped between the face side of a new empty bobbin and one of the empty bobbin accommodation plates of the creel. The projecting thread end is then cut off and disposed of through the suction nozzle.<br>
As represented in Claim 2, the device exhibits as usual, for the performance of the method according to the invention, a gripper tube specific to the winding head, a suction nozzle specific to the winding head, and a winding head computer.<br>
The suction nozzle or the gripper tube respectively are in this situation connected to a vacuum source by means of under-pressure or vacuum lines, which are switched into the solenoid valves.<br>
The winding head computer, which exhibits a control circuit, is connected by suitable control lines to the solenoid valves.<br>
Such an arrangement makes it possible in a simple manner for a defined actuation of the solenoid valves to be achieved. This means that both the suction nozzle as well as the gripper tube can, if required, be subjected to under-pressure or vacuum at any time, or operated without the imposition of under-pressure, so that a reliable transfer of the pneumatically-fixed thread end is guaranteed.<br>
In addition, provision is made in a preferred embodiment for the suction<br><br>
nozzle and the gripper rod to exhibit separate drive units, capable of being controlled in a defined manner, which, as represented in Claim 3, are connected via suitable control lines to the winding head computer and are designed as stepper motors.<br>
Such stepper motors are both economical and reliable. In addition, with such stepper motors it is possible, without a great deal of effort in terms of technical circuitry, to achieve a precise positioning suction nozzle and of the gripper tube.<br>
The invention is explained hereinafter on the basis of an embodiment represented in the drawings.<br>
The drawings show:<br>
Fig. 1A side view of a winding head of a textile machine for manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses, which exhibits according to the invention, as the well device as across-wound bobbin changer arranged above the textile machine,<br>
Figs. 2A to 2E	The  individual  steps  of  the  method  according  to  the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of a winding head 2 of a textile machine 1 for manufacturing cross-wound bobbins or cheeses. Such textile machines, in the present case an automatic cross-wound bobbin winder, exhibit between their out ends (not shown) a plurality of winding heads of the same type, hereinafter also designated as bobbins winders 2. On these winders 2, in a known manner and therefore not described in any greater detail, take-of f or supply bobbins, produced on ring spinning machines (not shown), referred to a s spinning cops 9, are wound in order to produce large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11.<br><br>
The finished cross-wound bobbins 11 are then loaded, by means of a movable service device, such as by means of a cross-wound bobbin changer 23, onto a cross-wound bobbin conveying device 21, and conveyed to a bobbin loading station or the like (not shown) arranged on the machine end side.<br>
Such automatic cross-wound bobbin winders 1 as a rule exhibit a logistics device in the form of a bobbin and empty bobbin conveying system J. In this bobbin and empty bobbin conveying system 3, of which Figure 3 shows only the cops feed sect ion 4 along the length of the machine, the reversible drivable storage section 5, one of the transverse conveying sections 6, and the empty bobbin return section 7, fresh spinning cops 9 and unwound empty bobbins run on conveying plates 8.<br>
The spinning cops 9 are in this case unwound in unwinding stations 10, which are located in each case in the area of the transverse conveying sections 6, and are wound up to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11.<br>
The individual winding heads 2, in order to carry out the winding process in the proper manner, are in each case provided with a number of devices which are inherently known and therefore only represented and described by indication. Winding heads 2 of this kind exhibit, for example, in the area of the unwinding station 10, a suction bell 44. The suction bell 44, into which a gripper tube 20 can be docked, which can be subjected to under-pressure, is for preference set back somewhat in relation to the regular thread run, and arranged above the spinning cop 9 positioned in the unwinding position 10. In addition to this, such winding heads 2 exhibit a suction' nozzle 12 for handling the top thread, a thread tensioning device 14, a thread cleaner 15 with a thread cutting device pertaining to it, as well as a paraffining device 16.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin 11 is held in a creel 18 during the winding process, this<br><br>
being mounted so as to rotate in a limited manner about a pivot axis 19. The cross-wound bobbin 11 is in this situation driven, for example, by a thread guide drum 17 in a frictional manner, which also provides for the cross-wise winding of the thread 30 onto the cross-wound bobbin 11.<br>
The functionally correct actuation of the thread handling devices described heretofore is effected by means of a spinning head computer 39. This winding head computer 39 features, among other things, a control circuit for the defined control of solenoid valves 38 and 50 respectively.<br>
As indicated in particular in Figures 2 A to 2E, both the suction nozzle 12 as well as the gripper tube 20 are connected by means of under-pressure or vacuum lines 53 and 54 respectively to a vacuum source 55.<br>
Connected into the under-pressure or vacuum lines 53, is in each case one of the solenoid valves 38 and 50 respectively, referred to heretofore, which are connected via control line 51 and 52 respectively to winding head computer 39 of the winding head 2 concerned.<br>
This means that both the suction nozzle 12 as well as the gripper tube 20 can be actuated in a defined manner by the winding head computer 39 in such a way that they can be optionally subjected to under-pressure, or that no under¬pressure pertains in the area of their mouth.<br>
For preference, the gripper tube 20 and the suction nozzle 12 in addition each exhibit their own drive unit 37 and 49 respectively. The drive units 37,49 are in this situation likewise connected by corresponding control lines 56, 57 to the winding head computer 39.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, a cross-wound bobbin changer 23 is arranged above the winding heads 2, capable of being moved on running rails 26,27.<br><br>
The cross-wound bobbin changer, which is supported with its running gear 24, 25 on the running rails 26, 27, and is provided with energy by, for example, a towing chain (not shown), not only provides for the fact that, if required, a completed cross-wound bobbin 11 is conveyed on the cross-wound bobbin conveying device 21, but also automatically introduces in each case a new empty bobbin 28 as a replacement into the creel 18 of the winding head 2 concerned. In this situation the empty bobbin 28 is taken by the cross-wound bobbin winder 23 out of an empty bobbin store 22 which is specific to the winding head.<br>
Such tried and trusted cross-wound bobbin changers 23, which have long been known, are provided with numerous handling devices in order to carry out the aforesaid and other known tasks, the function and method of effect of which are the state of the art.<br>
Of these known handling devices, only shown in Figure 1 are the creel opener 29, the empty bobbin delivered 31, the creel raiser 32, the bobbin guiding device 33, and the thread raiser 41.<br>
The thread raiser 41, mounted so as to be rotatable about a pivot axis 42, exhibits in this case, on the end side, a thread catching and cutting device 43.<br>
Function of the method according to the invention:<br>
As indicated in Figure 1, the thread 30 extends during regular spooling operation along a track, which runs from the spinning cop 9 over the thread guide drum 14 to the cross-wound bobbin 11.<br>
The thread 30 runs in this situation runs through, among other elements, the thread cleaner 15, which monitors the running thread 30 for thread defects.<br><br>
This means that, if the thread cleaner 15 detects a thread defect, a defined cleaner cut is triggered and the running thread is capped.<br>
The bottom thread in this situation remains retained as a rule in the thread tensioning device 14, while the top thread, which also contains the detect, runs onto the cross-wound bobbin 11.<br>
The winding device is then braked, and the bottom thread, held in the thread tensioning device 14, is laid by the gripper tube 20 into the thread splicing device 13.<br>
At the same time, or somewhat later, the suction nozzle 12 takes up the top thread. To do this, the cross-wound bobbin 11 is rotated slowly in the unwinding direction, and the thread end lying on the surface is sucked up by the suction nozzle. Once the thread defect has been rectified, the top, thread is likewise laid By the suction nozzle 12 into the thread splicing device 13 and there, as is known, is spliced to the bottom thread.<br>
The "normal" winding process is then restarted.<br>
An initially similar sequence is in principle when a cross-wound bobbin 11 has reached its desired diameter, and is intended to be replaced by a new empty bobbin.<br>
In this situation too, first a defined cleaner cut takes positioned at thread strand place, and then a thread splicing process, but whereby the winding head is not restarted.<br>
Instead, a cross-wound bobbin changer 23, positioned at the winding head 2 concerned, grips the thread strand tensioned between the spinning cop 9 and<br><br>
the cross-wound bobbin 11, by means of a suitable handling element such as a thread raiser 41, lays what is re referred to as a thread reserve onto the empty cross-wound bobbin and conveys the cross bobbin changer 23, the winding head -wound bobbin 11, after separation of the thread 20, into the cross-wound bobbin Conveying device 21 running the length of the machine. The thread raiser 41 in this situation holds the bottom thread securely, connected to the ' spinning cop 9, and then lays this securely on a newly-changed empty bobbin 28, which the cross-wound bobbin changer 23 has taken out of the intermediate store 22 specific to the individual winding head, and has laid in the creel 18.<br>
In the event of a batch change, the procedure has hitherto been incomparably more difficult, since in such cases there is no top thread available could be which, after splicing to the bottom thread, new empty bobbin 28.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, as indicated in Figure 2A, first the bottom thread of the new spinning, cop 9, which, as described in EP 0 805 118 Bl for example, is held ready in a suction bell, the gripper tube 20.<br>
This means that the gripper tube 20, subjected to under pressure, is docked at an opening of the suction bell 44 and pivoted, after sucking up the bottom thread with its mouth 47, upwards along the pivot path 48 into a transfer position, as indicated in Figure 2B. In this situation, thread 30 is also unwound from the spinning cop 9 and carried upwards with it. The suction nozzle 12 is then likewise pivoted somewhat upwards.<br>
This means that the mouth 35 of the suction nozzle 12 is pivoted upwards along the pivot path 36 so far until it stands just beneath the area characterised by the reference number 40, in which the pivot paths 48 and 36 of the mouths of the suction nozzle and the gripper tube intersect. As soon as the mouth 35 of the suction nozzle 12 is positioned Lightly beneath the mouth 47 of the gripper tube  20,  the  suction  nozzle   12  is  subjected   to   under-pressure   by   the<br><br>
corresponding actuation of the solenoid valve 38. At the same time, the solenoid valve 50 is switched in such a way that the under-pressure in the gripper tube 20 drops off.<br>
The solenoid valves 38, 50 now each adopt the switch position represented in each case in Figure 2C.<br>
The gripper tube 20 can then be pivoted back into its original position.<br>
The suction nozzle 12, now subjected to under-pressure, pivots further upwards, and in the process unwinds more thread 30 from the spinning cop 9.<br>
In the upper end position of the suction nozzle 12, thread 30, as indicated in Figure 2D, lies above the back of the mouth head of the suction nozzle 12, the and forms an easily accessible thread strand.<br>
A cross-wound bobbin changer 23, with a corresponding handling element such as a thread raiser 41, positioned in the area of the winding head 2 concerned, pivots into this thread strand.<br>
This means that the thread 30 is thread clamping and cutting device thread raiser 41, and is laid on an empty bobbin 28, which has in the interim been taken out of the intermediate store 22 on the winding head side by the cross-wound bobbin changer 23, and has been introduced as a replacement into the creel 18 (Figure 2E).<br>
The thread clamping and cutting device 43 then cuts off the protruding thread end, which is disposed of via the suction nozzle 12.<br>
In conclusion, the empty bobbin 28 is lowered onto the thread guide drum 17, and the winding process of the new yarn batch is started anew at the winding head 2 concerned.<br><br>
